3In Which Matthew Parts with His Mother and Plans to GoWestHEN he saw her at the edge of the clearing with Dave McIntosh , Matthew realized with a sudden shock that Sarahwas a won ' an grown . It was one of the changes wrought by the four long years since his father 's death . She had not seen him , since the width of the McIntosh fields lay between them , and 1'tatthew , being in no mood yet for talk with others , pulled Ranger and the pack horse he was leading to a halt , that they might breathe after the long climb , and resumed his dreary meditation . There was small need to go over it all again , for he had been thinking of little else since he had received his warehouse receipt in Richmond four days ago . He had sacrificed his books , even his mathematics , during the past season to work in the fields from sunup to dark , and yet , for all his care , two-thirds of the slender yield had been condemned as worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for him , brief enough in all conscience , had to be cut in half , and the horse was not burdened carryinghome the product of a year 's labor . He had no leaf reserved in the hiding place under the stable floor , for though peace was rumored , the Indian war had so ravaged the Great Valley that years might elapse before smugglers would again come down the Pennsylvania Road . And that same Indian war had closed the road to Ohio . He was trapped , he thought bitterly , trapped on exhausted land . For the hundredth time he shook his head doggedly . He glanced across the clearing to where Sarah stood with the November wind moulding her cloak to the young curves of her slim , tall body . He must think  --  f something to encourage his mother and the girls . The wind scurried over the bare fields and shook the dry leaves f the chinquapin bushes beside him to a ghostly whisper of laughter , before swooping down on the valley . His eyes followed it northeastwardover the torn lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders of the South West Range . The highest mass was Peter 's Mountain , named for Colonel Jefferson , dead these two years . Matthew 's mind dwelt for a space on his father 's friend , dI42 THE TREE OF LIBERTYand then moved on to Tom , changed too , and yet the same ; tall now , well-nigh as tall as Colonel Washington , and lean , but awkward still , his round face growing rugged with manhood but still freckled , and still lighted by the bright friendship of his smile . Matthew had spent the night at Shadwell with Tom and had found his friend restless and uneasy . " I 'm getting nowhere , " he exclaimed . " Company ! Company ! Oh , not you . Not Dabney . But last week it was Mr. Lewis here for three clays with my aunt , his lady , on their way to Fredericksburg , and a fortnight past it was Colonel Randolph and his daughters for ten days . A fourth of my time I am kept from school to squire the ladies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to do ? " Tom grinned sheepishly . " I find it too cursed pleasant , " he admitted , " when I ought to be at my books . I might make better progress at the college . Dabney 's going , you know . " " To Williamsburg ? " He nodded . " We 're asked to Colonel Randolph 's for the Christmastide . I 've a mind to sound the colonel 's opinion . My absence would put a stop to some of the coming and going , and lessen housekeeping expenses . " " And add the sum of your fees and your living at the capital . " Again Tom smiled . " You always poke your finger through my bubbles , Matt . But I mean it when I say I want to get on with my studies . There 's something about old Maury at the log school  --  he stirs you up  --  makes you want something . Like Dominie Douglass . You remember , Matt ? " " Liberty , " suggested Matthew with a touch of bitterness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by a struggle . My father was a leader in Albemarle , " he added with apparent irrelevance . He was standing with his back to the hearth , hands clasped behind him , head thrust out , hazel eyes narrowed as if peering forwardthrough a mist . Then for a flying moment those eyes met Matt 's , and Matt 's thought was that they blazed . " I may go to Williamsburg , but I 'll come back , " he said . " Neverfear ! " Matthew took instant fire . " I 'm not afeared ! " he cried . His grammar often played him traitor when he was stirred . " You too will lead in Albemarle , and when that day comes , I 'll follow ! " DIVERGENT ROOTS 43He grew hot now on the windy hilltop to think of his fervor . Had he taken leave of his senses ? he wondered . He gathered up his reins and clucked to the horses . Sarah was still talking to Dave McIntosh , and he was suddenly curious as towhat could hold her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads quickly on their way , and Dave she had sometimes been forced to banish several times a day . He must have a strange new tune , that she should listen like this , but whatever it was it fell to silence as Matthew came up . He drew rein and shook his foot free of the near stirrup . " Evening , Dave , " he said gravely . " Want a lift home , Sarah ? Or have you more to talk about ? I 've been watching you from acrossthe clearing , and even for a woman-person you seemed primed full of talk . " Sarah caught his hand and using the stirrup he had cleared forher leaped to a seat on Ranger 's back behind his saddle before she answered . " Hit 's a fairish wonder you bring home e'er a deer , Matt , iffen that 's what you saw across this clearin ' . I 've been tryin ' moughtilyfor a full round hour , but hit 's past human power to slide one word in edgeways . Dave has me deaf as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , but he was silent enough now , standing by the road and looking at her with such entreaty in his face that Matthew screwed his head over his shoulder in an effort to see his sister . She had drawn the hood of her cloakforward and was hidden , but she hooked her fingers in his belt and nudged him gently . " Go on , Matt . " " Sarah ! " Dave 's voice sounded strangled . " Is this the manner of fare-ye-well you have for me ? " " Fare-ye-well , Dave ? " Matthew could not see her , but he knew her eyes had widened in that innocent stare she used to put on for him . " What way is it you 're not comin ' up to the home-place tonight ? Mammy and Matt will want to learn of your move to Carolina . " Dave came forward and laid a hand on the stirrup leather . He still had no eyes for Matthew . " Iffen I come will you answer me ? " Sarah 's laughter rippled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way . " Come and see , Dave , " she said , and laughed again . But before they had entered the woods her laughter had ended in a tremulous sigh . Matthew pulled Ranger to a walk . This matter44 THE TREE OF LIBERTYwould bear looking into . He began with as stern a voice as he could muster . " What 's all this , now ? You and Dave ! What fool-play are you at , Sarah ? " Her answer surprised him . It was as if she had wilted . Her hands crept about his waist and she pressed her cheek against the back of his coat . " Oh , Matt ! " she said , and again , " Matt ! " Was she going to cry ? Sarah ! Awkwardly he patted her hand , and tried again in a gentler tone . " So Dave takes the road to Carolina ? We 'll be sorry to see him go , but it 's a fine chance for him . And what is it to you , that there should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , and it sounded now as if she would laugh again . If he could only see her face , but she kept it clapped to his back . " It 's a dunce notion , Dave has , " he went on firmly , " thinking that you  --  do n't let his dunce notions trouble you , Sarah . You 're naught but a child . " She sat up at that and shook his belt . " I 'm a woman growed , Matt , and you know it . And Dave needs a woman-person on that far journey . " Matthew gasped . " You 're never thinking  --  Why , Sarah , what way would mammy do ? Ellen she 's too small yet for to take your place , and mammy  --  " Sarah was laughing now in good earnest . " Matt , do n't you see ? But , of course , you 're minded not to see . All is , mammy she mought go too . " " Mammy , she  --  ! " Ranger was jerked to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dave 's dunce notions have addled your good sense . Mammy she 's ne'er one to leave her own home-place to sit by another woman 's fire . " " She 's not , for a fact , Matt . You 're right , there . " " Well , then ! I have it in mind when I go from here to travel west  --  not south . " Sarah appeared to consider this . " There 's a many goin ' south , Matt . The Mclntoshes , the Murdochs  --  andAlex McTavish . " The last name came after a slight pause . " The old schoolmaster ? Well , what of that ? " " Nothin ' . Not one endurin ' thing . All is , Matt , a bat in daytime , he 's got fine eyes alongside o ' you . " And she laughed as if at a jest . DIVERGENT ROOTS 45Matthew snorted , and started Ranger again . There was no use talking to Saran when she had a laughing fi , . He rode up the trail in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . When they turned in to the home-place , Ellen rose from a stone by the side of the path , where she had been sitting as if waiting for someone . Her face lit up at the sight of Matthew , and she came forward to take the toe of his boot in caressing brown fingers , but she spoke to Sarah . " Mr. McTavish is here . " Sarah slid to the ground . " Have you picked up the nuts that Dave knocked down for us ? " The child shook her head . " Come , then . We 'll fill your apron full , and mine . " With an odd sigh , as if somehow the suggestion came as a relief , Ellen took Sarah 's hand and the two turned into the woods . Matthew looked after them amazed . They had both apparently forgotten the pack from Richmond that the horse was carrying . If McTavish was there his mother could scarcely join him at the barn as was her wont , but he gave her a hail as he passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than a little time after he gave this hail , while he tended Ranger , unpacked the loaded horse , and watered and fed all the animals , before he laid his hand on the house latch , and yet he had a feeling as he straightened up inside the door with his packs on his shoulder that he had broken in on something . McTavish stood at an awkward angle before the settle where Susan sat , as if he had but just gotten to his feet . Neither spoke , and it seemed to Matthew that his mother 's face was strangely pink . With an oddly cautious motion he laid down the packs . He sensed an unknown danger . " Here 's a strange home-coming , mother , " he said . The formal speech came naturally . It suited the threat in the air . With the quick , sure movement he loved , she came to him to put her arms about his lean young body which for the first time did not yield to her touch . " Matthew ! Matthew ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget how tall-growed you are , and against you come back , I lose my breath to see you . He stooped his head , this son o ' mine , that he mought come in that door , did you see ? " She flung the question with gay pride at the schoolmaster , who stood before the hearth now , packing tobacco in a pipe . " It 's just what I told you . Mistress Howard . He 's a man , and your wee lad no longer . " " I 've been a man these four years , " cried Matthew with some heat . He resented what sounded like condescension , and suddenly46 THE TREE OF LIBERTYall the worry and uncertainty of the last days found vent in vexationagainst this little man . " What business is it of yours to tell my mother what she very well knows ? " McTavish took his pipe from his mouth and would have spoken , but Matthew 's mother was quicker . She shook his arms that she still held to gain his attention . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finer than ever , since I see by the size of the pack you had a poor time at Richmond . We 're for Carolina , Matthew , where land is still good and Indians are friendly . " " Aye , lad , " McTavish added . " You need moil and toil no more on thankless land . We 're for Carolina before snow . " Matthew lifted his head angrily , and the muscles under his lean cheeks twitched . " Who gave you the right to stand on my father 's hearthstone , and tell my mother what she 's to do ? " " I did , Matthew , " said his mother quietly , and then as the boy 's face frew pale her fingers tightened on his arms , while she spoke over her shoulder to the schoolmaster . " You 'd best leave us now , Alex . We can finish our talk in the morning . " Matthew waited until he heard the door close , his eyes searchingher dear face , and his brain shouting this could not mean what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice was piteous , almost frightened . " You 'd never have McTavish marry with you . " Her eyes wavered . " Matthew , this is fool-play  --  all this fuss  --  " He stiffened . " Hit 's a question I asked that has one answer . Yes or no . " " Matthew , hit would be God 's own shame for you to mistake me . I  --  " " Yes or no . " His mother flared at last . She dropped her hold of him . " Iffen you will have it so  --  Yes , then . Yes and yes ! " He stood where she had left him , motionless . The door openedand closed . " Sit down on the settle , Matthew . " She spoke dully . " The girls are here and there 's supper to get . " He sat where she told him , but he would not eat . He was silent , attentive only to the crashing destruction of his inner world . Hours later , she sat down beside him and took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ellen ? " he questioned . DIVERGENT ROOTS 47 " She 's laid to sleep this good hour , " his mother told him . " We can talk . " His voice was hard . " There 's naught to say , " he said . " Matthew , I have it in mind your father would want you to hear me out . He was e'er natured to be just . " " That 's so , for a fact , " he admitted in a low voice . " Go on , mammy . " Womanlike , she began a long way off from the center of her thought . " I 'm fair amazed you do n't admire this far journey , Matthew . When first the talk came to my ei rs , I said in my mind , here 's what Matt would admire to do . You were always one to talk of a far journey , and the land here is wore out , and us beaten down with it . I thought you 'd admire to go to Carolina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off , though I 've e'er had it in my mind to go west  --  not south . " " Whichever way  --  or west or south  --  hit 's a frontier we go to find , and a frontier 's no place for a woman-person withouten e'er a man , Matthew . " " You had a man ! " he cried at that . " You had me . Your homeplacehas been as safe as e'er other woman 's in the Gap these four years . " " These four years , yes . Matt , you 've no need to tell your mammy the great-natured son you 've been , and you naught but a lad . But you 're man-growed now , Matt . You must seek your own woman , and when you found her , this would be her home-place , not mine . " She waited , holding his hand between her own . When he did not answer , Sarah stirred and laid her knitting in her lap . " Matt , what 's come over you ? " she asked impatiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne'er one to sit quiet by e'er other woman 's hearth ! Are you turned foolish that you ca n't see  --  " He rose to his feet uneasily . " I see one thing so plain I can see naught beside . I see James Howard in this room , movin ' in the firelight like a painter from the hills . I see James Howard , head and shoulders over this runt she 's chosen . " The two women were on their feet now , too , his mother steadyingherself by a hand on the fireplace shelf . " You 're not the only one sees pappy here , " cried Sarah hotly , " But how can he fend for mammy ? He 's dead . " " He is , for a fact , " retorted Matthew bitterly . " Dead and forgotten . " His mother gave a cry at this , but he went on unheeding , 48 THE TREE OF LIBERTY " But I 've not forgotten , I , his son . As for you and Mistress McTavish , you may go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift and carry for you while you stay . I 'll stow your gear in your wagon if you will . But I 'll not talk with you , and when you leave , I 'd sooner stay  --  here  --  with him  --  as God hears me , I would ! " His mother stood frozen even when Sarah put warm arms about her . " Never you mind him , mammy , " she begged . " He 's naught but a dunce who ca n't see the living for the dead . Let him go . You 'll ne'er lack a son . Dave will love and cherish you , and Alex  --  " " You 're all alike , you women , " Matthew broke in , maddened by that name . " Fickle , faithless  --  " " Do n't say more , Matt . " Sarah 's voice was stern . " I have it in mind the day will come when you would give your heart to take back words already said . " Weeks later , as he jogged along the Three Notched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sarah 's reproach . It troubled him for she had sounded so sure ; and yet , go over it all as he had , night after night in the loneliness since they had left , he could not see how his father 's son could have done otherwise . It was a bad , bitter business that he did well to put behind him . And he could put it behind him now , for they were gone . He had sold the place , home-place no longer , to old Ben Norton , the trapper who cared nothing for the land . A house was what Ben wanted , and the house was sound , like everything James Howard had made . It was Ben Norton 's place now , and Matt Howard was a surveyor searching for work to do , a man without a home it was true , but for that very reason free to go where he would . It was strange how cheerless he found the liberty he had longed to have . He tried to explain it to Tom , in the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with swift understanding Tom went to the aching heart of the matter . " ' T was a vast pity there had to be a quarrel , Matt . But quarrel or no , there would have been a parting , for they now have no need of you . Sarah has Dave , and  --  " he sought for a considerate phrase , " your mother is cared for and little Ellen with her . Ca n't you just put the quarrel out of your mind ? After all , what 's done 's done . Perhaps you could come to think of them as going on in new ways of their own . " Matthew shook his head hopelessly , but Tom went on . " Perhaps your own liberty might then seem something to be rized again- " DIVERGENT ROOTS 49Matthew looked up quickly at this and Tom smiled . He was too wise to push an advantage . He turned the subject . " What are your plans ? " he asked . Matthew spread his hands in a gesture of uncertainty . " Plan ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , Tom . I 've always had it in mind to go west  --  you know that . I thought to go like my father , as a soldier . But the war is ending . Now  --  " he hesitated . " There 's my surveying  --  " he paused again , and then squared his shoulders as his words came fast . " If I could once get to Ohio , I 'd make shift to stay . " " I warrant you would , " Tom told him . " We must just find you a man with land in Ohio . " " Land that needs surveying , " Matthew amended with a grin . " I 've a few pistoles in my belt from the sale of the cabin , and I 'm for Scott 's Ferry to record the sale at the courthouse and to get me some surveying instruments . Then I 'll angle for my gentleman , at least until my purse is flat . " " Instruments ! " exclaimed Tom . " But I thought  --  " " The ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schoolmaster . " " Of course . " Tom spoke hurriedly . " But look here , Matt . Those things cost money . " " I know . I sha n't have much time to angle . But somehow I look for luck , with niy face set to Ohio at last . " Tom rose and absently poked the end of a fallen log back into the fire with the toe of his boot . Suddenly he whirled about with face alight . " Matt ! I 've just thought . My father had surveying tools . Good ones , too . He and Colonel Fry ran the Carolina boundary , you know . " They 're in the attic at the office , transit , rod , compass , everything . At least , they are if the twins have n't found them . Randolph leads Anna Scott into all sorts of mischief . You just take those instrumentsand save your money . " Matthew laughed outright . " Hit 's like you , for a fact , Tom . And I 'll buy them gladly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . But a gift , " he shook his head . " Those things cost money , as you said yourself . " " Matt , do n't be an ass ! I said they were lying idle in the attic . ho could put them to a better use than the lad my father loved ? ' ome along . We 'll get them now . " He would have hurried from the room , but Matthew laid a hand on his arm . " Tom , I ca n't  --  a gift like that  --  " " Matt Howard ! " Tom 's face was red . " There are times when50 THE TREE OF LIBERTYI could cheerfully take my fists to you , though I do n't believe in fighting . Call it a loan , then , a loan till you make your way and can buy others of your own . Come , lad , for old time 's sake . " He held out his hand . " Wildcats ! " he said . Matthew 's voice choked as he took the proffered hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget this , Torn . " " I 'll demand usury some day , Matthew . Mark my words ! " Presently the two brought the dust-covered instruments to Tom 's room which Matthew was sharing . Torn balanced the compassin his hands , wiped the glass and watched the quivering needle . " It 's motion is lively , Matt , but you 'd better prove it with some surveyor 's at the county seat . " Matt grunted absently . He had just done polishing the lens of the telescope on the transit and was squinting through the window at the top to Tom 's mountain . " Zounds , Tom ! This is a beauty . Better than any I might have had for many a year . " With a loving gesture he rubbed the instrumentalong his sleeve to bring up the lustre of smooth barrel and plate before he laid it on the bed by the legs of its detached tripod and the long rod . " I 've thought of something else , Matt , " Tom said . " My cousin , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger Peyton with him , another young sprig from the Tidewater  --  you 'll see them at dinner . They might have some ideas that you could use . They should know the whereabouts of people of western lands , at least . We 'll sound them out at dinner . " Dinner at Shadwell was a lengthy affair as Matthew remembered , with the little children at the side table to be served , as well as the older members of the family and the guests ; but somehow it had never seemed so long drawn out as it did that afternoon . Fouryear-oldRandolph was in an unruly mood and caused a great interruptionby spilling his mug of milk into his twin sister 's lap . Mrs. Jefferson was full of questions about her Randolph kin , and the girls must get some sort of description of the costumes worn by the ladies at the Governor 's Assembly . Time dragged on . The sleepy children were carried away by their mammy . Candles were brought . Even after the ladies had withdrawn and the four young gentlemen were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randolph led the talk in channels of his own choosing , punctuating his words by emptying and filling his glass with rhythmic regularity . Young Peyton , following his every move , matched him glass for glass . " Every man 's eyes were on Wild Air and Silverfoot , " he said , bringing to a close a vivid description of the fall races at Williamsburg , " with not a thought of Roger here . I expect everyone hadDIVERGENT ROOTS 51Laughed when he entered Othello . A lad and his favorite mount , they said . But on the last stretch here came the colt nosing up , and he passed the post a length ahead of the nearest horse . I watched his action , Roger , and he was n't at full stride till the very end . Gad , sir , that Othello will be the greatest horse that ever spurned turf with a flying hoof . And greatly ridden , Roger , which is more than half of it . ' T is a vast pity you wo n't be on him at the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend 's face Randolph caught himself up . His whole tone changed . " Forgive me , old man . I reckon I 've been rubbing salt in a wound . " Roger Peyton flung up his fingers with a dismissing gesture , although his face was set . " Suppose we talk of cocks , " he said . " That was a great main at Yorktown last month . " At the suggestion , Jack Randolph was off again on the points of the great birds of the river plantations pitted against each other . Now and again , Torn tried to direct his thoughts nearer to the subject of western lands , but he brushed aside each interruption with a practiced smoothness that made his young host glance at Matthew with comic dismay . Matthew 's own head was swimming slightly , and his sense of nervous urgency had been mellowed to patience by the Jefferson Madeira . He leaned on his folded arms . They were amusing fellows after all , these two from the lowlands , with their carefully arranged hair and smooth white hands . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough wool sleeves of his hunting shirt and contrasted them with Roger Peyton 's slender fingers , delicately holding the delicate stem of his glass . More like women than men , for all their cockfights . This young Peyton now , with his wide brown eyes and pointed chin , he looked like Ellen . Like Ellen , and iike  --  instinctively Matthew 's mind veered from the thought of his mother . The final cockfight was over ; Tom was introducing Matthew 's situation , perhaps with greater frankness than might have seemed fitting earlier in the evening ; and Randolph and young Peyton were giving strict attention , staring at Matthew with a seriousness that made him think suddenly of owls . " Damn ' shame ! " declared Randolph when Tom had finished . Without taking solemn eyes from Matthew , he addressed his friend with elaborately careful speech . " Roger , we ought to do something for Mr. Howard . Estimable young man . " " Always bes ' to ' courage es'mable young men , " agreed Roger glibly . Randolph 's eyes slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you suggest something ? " he demanded . Young Peyton surveyed Matthew gravely , a faint trouble in his face , and struck again by his resemblance to Ellen , Matthew wrap . moved to smile at him . " Someone who needs surveyor ? " he prompted . Peyton nodded . " My brother Fleetwood jus ' the man . Rich . Worlds o ' land Always fightin ' . Needs surveyor ev ' other day . But fights ev'body . Fought me . Kicked me out . " He turned to Jack Randolph . " I ca n't do a thing with Fleetwood . Sorry . Would ' f I could . " Randolph considered this while the other three watched him . They were all on their feet now and all swaying slightly . " Anyone else got influence with Fleetwood , Roger ? " Peyton nodded again . " Sister , " he declared emphatically , " Jane . " " Ladies , " announced Randolph disapprovingly , " ladies , God bless ' em , all right . But should n't be mixed with business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Peyton 's concession was generous . " You sound jus ' like George Wythe . " " There y'are ! " cried Randolph . " Should have thought of him before . George Wythe . Knows everybody . Fleetwood Peyton . Every- body . " Roger Peyton clapped Matthew on the shoulder . " Send es'mable young man to George Wythe . Two es'mable young men together ! " " Where your writing materials , Tom ? " asked Randolph . " Library , " said Tom briefly , and led the way from the room . Randolph followed with a branched candlestick and Matthew brought up the rear with Roger Peyton clinging to his shoulder . In the library Tom had a moment of hesitation . " This important letter , Jack . Matt 's never been in Tidewater . Wo n't be easy for him at best . If he had wrong introduction  --  " He Y g waved an explanatory hand . " Better wait , maybe ? " " Tha 's right , " Roger Peyton put in " We 're pretty drunk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared Randolph firmly . " Bring out the paper , Tom . " The others watched his slowly moving pen . Once he raised his head . " Had any experience , Howard ? " he asked in a businesslike tone . 4 " Worldsof ' sperience , " Matthew replied with a gesture that took in endless space , " bes ' surveyor in Albemarle . " Randolph ph nodded and finished thee note to which he signed hisname . As he was folding it Tom Jefferson checked him . " Had n't we better read it ? See how it sounds ? " Jack Randolph shook off the restraining hand and reached for i sealing wafer . " Do n't you know we 're drunk ? Ca n't anybody read my writing even when he 's sober , Tom . " He sealed his missive and gave it to Matthew who bowed uncertainly . " Like to thank you , Mr. Randolph . " " Perfectly possible , Mr. Howard . Just help me to bed . Forgot my boots last time . Cousin Jane fine woman , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the oth ers he left the room , his arm about Matthew 's shoulders . Matthew woke the next morning to find Tom , partly dressed in stockings , breeches and shirt , kneeling on the floor by his chest and rummaging among the assorted garments it contained . At his friend 's greeting he got to his feet and brought to the bed a dark green suit that Matt remembered he had worn the year before . " Matt , " lie said - arnestly , " when you earn your first money you must be measured for a suit of clothes  --  Mr. Wythe can cornmendyou to a good tailor  --  but meanwhile you ca n't go to Williamsburgin that hunting shirt . " " I certainly can , " declared Matt belligerently . " It 's a good shirt and new . " " ' T is indeed , " Tom agreed , " and it becomes you well , but its not the garb that Williamsburg will connect with a knowledge of science . In some ways you 'll find them a queer lot down there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression . A surveyor must wear a tailored suit . " A slow red crept up Matthew 's face . " And so you 're giving me this one of yours ? " " Not so fast , young n an , " laughed Toni . " Giving it to you , indeed ! Not I ! I like it too well myself . Climb down now from your high horse and try it on . And mind you clean off any spots you get on it before you send it back to me . There 's a pair of shoes here that go with it , if you promise not to skin the toes . It 's lucky we 're of a size , Matt , that coat sets fairly well . Buckle on this stock now and pull my shaving box forward for a look at yourself . " Matthew stood before the bureau and tipped the mirror to see himself section by section , first white lawn stock and broad green shoulders , then black and silver waistcoat , and more green coat with silver buttons , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full skirts of the coat , and lastly thi silver-buckled shoes below his own gray wool stockings . He was amazed at the quiet54 THE TRLE OF LIBERTY gentility of it all . No guest at Shadwell had ever been more un- obtrusively well dressed . He turned to Torn with his eyes alight . " I have it in mind , " he said gleefully , " even Williamsburg will accept the wildcat from the hills now . " " They may even think you a gentleman , lad , " Tom told him solemnly . " ' T is a wonder how clothes will disguise a man . " With a quick side step he dodged Matthew 's wrathful swing . " Hop out of them now , till I give them to Joe to freshen up . When you get back from Scott 's Ferry tonight they 'll be ready . " " But , Tom , " Matthew demurred , " I 'm not coming back . My plan is to go on down the James by boat . There must be some at Scott 's Ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh enough . God knows , there 's no need to do anything more to it . " With arms akimbo , Torn mocked at him . " For a lad that 's so quick with his hands you 're mortal slow in the head , Matt . Have you forgotten your instruments , or do you plan to wind the chain around your neck like my Lord Mayor of London and to carry rod and transit like a pike and halberd ? " Matt grinned . " I had thought to shoulder them from here to Scott 's Ferry . " " I 've a plan worth two of that . The overseer , Thompson , starts for Point of Fork this morning to take a flat loaded with our tobacco to Richmond . After last night 's talk my mother and the girls will have plenty of commissions for him if I send him on to Williams- burg . His brother runs a pinnace on the lower James , so there 's no doubt if you give him a day 's start he can be in the capital before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raleigh for your use when you come . " " A great overseer was spoiled , " declared Matthew mournfully , " when you were born a planter . The way you can manage men !  --  I 'll be back from Scott 's Ferry tonight when I 've recorded my sale . " The following day , before starting to Williamsburg , Matthew had a private word with Tom . Was it wise to use Jack Randolph 's I letter , written as it had been , without examination ? Tom pondered the question . " You ca n't present it after the seal is broken , that 's certain , Matt , and it may be all right . I 'd use it . it 'll give you a chance to meet Mr. Wythe . If there 's anything wrong with it  --  well  --  Mr. Wythe is young , Peyton said . You could probably explain , and he might laugh . There 's no better introduction to some men than a good laugh . " " I hope to God he 's that kind , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . Depression had been his mood when he rose that morning , an inevitable reaction from the excitement of the days before , and depression certainly colored his farewell talk with Tom , but as he Net out on the familiar road to Richmond he found an unexpected thing happening to him . He had been over this road until he knew every twist and turn , but somehow today the magic of a far journey was on it . He saw the snowy contours of the hills sinking to the plain with new eyes . He was on his way  --  to what he did not know , with what might easily be a compromising letter to a stranger for his only introduction to a world he had never seen  --  but he was on his way , and his spirits rose with every step . Ranger , sensing a change in him , shied coyly at a rabbit , and Matthew laughed aloud . He took the journey easily , having no mind to injure Tom 's I suit or to present himself to Mr. Wythe bedraggled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must look fit for anything . He pent two days reaching Richmond and planned another stop short f the capital . Jim Burke at the Indian Queen recommended the I ) avies Tavern six miles out of Williamsburg as a small quiet place where he could likely have a good sleep , and he started late in the morning of the third day with this as his objective . But when he pulled up before the door at the end of an afternoon of snow that had changed to sleet and later settled to a drizzle of rain , his satisfactionoozed away with the cold drip from his hat . A drove of cattle stamped and lowed in a paddock behind the house , and when he entered , the small taproom seemed full of men with cow dung on their feet . Its acrid odor , mingled with the stench of sweat and of wet wool coats , smote him in the face . He would have gone out ; gain , for all the lateness of the hour , if the host had not pushed through between the tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean freckled face . " We have a crowd in here , sure enough , sir , " he said in answer to the expression in Matthew 's eyes . " But above I have a room with a good bed and a fire laid that old Jim can light in jig time , sir . I f the young gentleman will follow me your supper can be brought up there , sir . It 's a bad night , sir , " he went on as Matthew hesitated , " and there 's no other inn between here and the city . I 'll have a liicken for you , if you say the word , sir . " Matthew grinned , for the man was oddly importunate ; as if itrallymattered to him , even with a full house , whether one guest ent or stayed . " I 'll certainly say the word , then , whatever it may be . I have a ! gorse outside . Can you look after him , too ? " " Yes , sir , I can , sure enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . gro leaning against a corner of the bar , " light the fire upstairs , r the young gentleman , and then take care of his horse . " 56 THE TREE OF LIBERTYThe negro with a tug at a grizzled forelock started at once up the stairs at the back of the room , and Matthew followed in the wake of the freckled man who wedged a passage for him between the chairs . Above , a little hallway ended in an open door through which came a flickering light . The freckled man led the way inside a room of fair size which evidently ran the width of the house . Matthew stared at a large white blur and made out a bed curtained against the drafts . Beyond it was the dark shadow of a chest of drawers , and at the far end the pallid outline of a fan window . Here on the right old Jim knelt on the hearth , encouraging a tiny flame in a cavern of a fireplace with a pair of bellows . The freckled-faced man bustled about , lighting candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his apron , still with his air of serving a potentate . " You have it all to yourself up here , sir . Mrs. Davies and I have our rooms over the kitchen . You 'll find the drovers leave at daylight and if you just draw the curtains , sir , you ought to get a good nap of sleep , after they leave . " " From the look of your bed , I have it in mind I might sleep the clock around , " Matthew asserted . " You are Mr. Davies ? " " Humphrey Davies , sir , and very much at your service . " Odd , the way the fellow kept bowing and smiling . If he went on much longer Matthew would feel out of place in spite of his green coat and silver buttons . A clatter and splash of horses ' hoofs outside , and the sound of a door below being thrown violently open , caught their ears and set Davies to bowing again . " If there 's nothing more , sir ? " " Davies ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming , sir , " called the innkeeper , and with a final bow he was gone . Turning to the fireplace Matthew found the negro had vanished as well , and without instructions for Ranger 's care . He caught up the cloak he had laid aside and groped his way along the passage to the stairs . He would see to his horse himself . Halfway down the stair he paused , for three strangers and Davies effectually blocked the foot . As Matthew arrived one of the strangers pushed aside three mugs to make a place for himself and sat down on the edge of a table . To Matthew 's astonishment , instead of roughly hustling him off his perch , the three drovers rescued their drinks from overturningwithout comment and crowded together uncomfortably to give the stranger room . Talk in the inn had ceased and all the men were staring at the newcomers , but there was no hint of resentment in the stare . The firelight fell full on the man seated on the edge of theDIVERGENT ROOTS 57table , touching the indolent grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pride in the thin face , the high-bridged nose , and fine dark eyes under arched brows that lifted at the corners . The man looked like an eagle , Matthew thought . His smile as he spoke was charming . " Firefly went lame four miles back , Davies , and we 've been limping along for an hour , keeping up our spirits with thoughts of your room upstairs . " The innkeeper 's face was a profile of sympathetic regret , as Matthew could see . " I 'm sorry , sir , but  --  " " It will do very well for one night , Davies . I 've sent Xenophon to Elm Hill for another mount and he 'll be back by morning . If you ca n't bear the thought of three of us in that bed of yours , make up a pallet on the settle , man . Only clear the stairway for God 's sake , and let us get out of this filthy atmosphere ! " He rose from the table , and with a shock Matthew realized he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he managed clumsily . Humphrey Davies was bowing protestingly . " I 'm sorry , sir . Indeed I am . It 's not the bed , sir , but  --  " Matthew descended the stair to lay a hand on the innkeeper 's shoulder . " Mr. Davies ' trouble is that he has let the room to me , " he told the waiting three . " But this is no night to walk and lead a lame horse , and if you really can sleep three in a bed , I 'd be mightily pleased with the pallet by the fire myself . I 've ridden from Richmond in this storm , and it will take a night 's toasting to thaw me out . " Before he ended this speech he found himself addressing the lame man , who removed a dripping hat in an easy bow . " This is far more than ordinary courtesy , sir , " he said , " and if there were a house or another inn within walking distance we should not think of presuming on it . Necessitas non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our apology . " At the sound of the Latin Matthew 's school days returned . " Fiat justitia ruat coelum , ' " he replied with a bow , " and in justice there 's much in my side of the balance . I shall have good company when I looked to be lone and lorn . " " I perceive , sir , you are a scholar as well as a gentleman . " The lame man certainly had a charming smile . " If you put it that way no man can refuse you . Lead up the stair , sir , and we 'll follow gladly , for this is really  --  " He had drawn a lace-edged handkerchief from his cuff and applied it to his nose with a grimace of comical disgust . Matthew58 THE TREE OF LIBERTYglanced about with tensed muscles . At Wood 's Ordinary on the Three Notched Road such a gesture would have been a signal for a brawl , but here none of the watching drovers seemed to sense the insult . What manner of men were they ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stair . " I 'll ask Mr. Davies to lead you , " he said . " I have a horse here I must tend . " To his surprise the lame man laid a detaining hand on his sleeve . " It 's evident you 're a stranger , sir . Old Jim is the best farrier in all Virginia , and he has already thought of more to do for the comfort of your horse than you and I could devise in a week . And he likes to be left in charge . Damn it , sir , " he added with another smile , as Matthew still hesitated , " Firefly is as fine a bit of horsefleshas was ever foaled , yet you see I 've left her to old Jim although she 's lame . He knows horses , sir , and he works best alone . So keep your shoulders dry and come on upstairs . And , Davies ! " he called over his shoulder to the innkeeper . " We share the gentleman 's room , but he eats with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chicken . " The upstairs room , lit by the great fire roaring up the chimney and by the uncertain light of too few candles , was shadowy and unreal , but not more unreal than his three companions came to seem to Matthew before the evening was over . There were no introductionsas there would have been in Albemarle , but he learned that the tall , sandy stranger was called Dick , and the youngster with the gray eyes was Lewis . The man from Elm Hill remained nameless , for the others always addressed him as " sir . " At first , the associationof the three with Matthew , being born of travel , was evidently considered to be as transient as the occasion which gave it rise ; but as the evening wore on their flawless courtesy grew warmer . They were accepting him quite frankly as one of themselves , and yet , again and again in the progress of the excellent meal , or during the game of loo that followed it , Matthew checked himself in a stare that he feared was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Williamsburg they set out hilariously to make him familiar with the capital . The picture they drew had little resemblance to ideas already formed at ColonelJefferson 's table . The governor in their eyes was the pivot and center of a social whirl , the giver of the Governor 's Ball . His manners were discussed , his clothes , his wines , and once , in a glancing reference , his scholarly attainments . He was deuced fond of reading , this Francis Fauquier . The assembling of the House of Burgesses was merely the excuse which brought together gentlemen with goodDIVERGENT ROOTS 59horses who were ready to race , and more than ready to bet on the outcome of the races . And strangest of all , tobacco was only money , supplied at stated times by an overseer , not a plant to be coaxed and wheedled into a growth that exhausted the soil . Not once did they mention the soil . Names seemed to have a strange magic . They brought them up continually in their talk . " Of course ! He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient for any incredible act . Matthew could not follow their thought , and they had themselvesbecome unreal , incredible as the tales they told . Toward the end of the evening he took advantage of a lull to ask the man from Elm Hill if George Wythe was one of these young bloods . " I have a letter to him , " he explained . The answer was a peal of laughter , suddenly spontaneous , and as suddenly hushed . The three looked at each other . " He 's a fine lawyer , of course , " ventured Lewis . " None better , I believe , " remarked Dick . " He takes care of all my work , " said the man from Elm Hill . " But George Wythe  --  a young blood ! " gasped Lewis , and they all laughed again . " Of course , he 's one of us , " explained the man from Elm Hill , " and he used to ride as fast , and play as high as any of us . But four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Never takes a drop too much or plays cards for high stakes  --  " " How old is George , do you think , sir ? " broke in Dick . " He ca n't be much over thirty . " " Oh , he must be ! " cried Lewis . " No man only thirty would be so staid  --  not even a reformed man . " And they were off on a discussion of George Wythe 's age , which they finally reluctantly agreed might be less than his sober behavior would suggest , while Matthew sat uneasy with that letter of Jack Randolph 's buttoned in his coat . This uneasiness kept him long awake on his pallet by the fire , and it had not left him when he rode on to Williamsburg with the other three in the morning . George Wythe 's extraordinary virtue might make a drunken prank impossible to explain . At the center of town his three companions drew rein , and the lame man held out his hand . " When you have done with your business come out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would like to return a small part of your courtesy before you leave Williamsburg . This is Duke of Gloucester Street .

All the boatmenknow the place . And now good day , sir . Since the General Court is in session you 'll find Mr. Wythe in the little house with the green door just across from the Raleigh Tavern . A fine man to dealwith , just and upright , sir . " Which was all very well , Matthew thought , but not particularlyencouraging in his case . As his companions turned up the green toward the governor 's palace he went slowly down the street in the direction indicated . At the house with the green door he hesitated and then crossed the street to the inn . He would put Ranger up , claim his instruments , scrape the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his courage well in hand for the ordeal . But not all this reinforcing could prepare him for Mr. Wythe when a grinning young negro in a blue coat with brass buttons ushered him into the lawyer 's office . George Wythe was a well-built man , though little above middle height , with a ruddy , engaging face , and gray eyes that looked reassuringly as if they could twinkle . For the moment he seemed troubled , however . He took Jack Randolph 's letter and laid it unopened on his desk , while he waved Matthew to a chair . " Pray be seated , Mr.  --  Mr.  --  " he looked down at the letter . " IToward , " prompted Matthew , " Matthew Howard , at yourservice . " " Mr. Howard , yes , sir . Pray be seated , and forgive if I taken moment  --  a matter of business  --  Jonas ! " The blue-coated negro boy drew near . " Yas , suh , Marse George . " " You say he was hurt , Jonas ?

" " Well , Jonas , there 's liquor for you . It should n't be mixed with business . " Jonas grinned slyly at Matthew , but the face he turned hisraster was solemn . " No , suit . Dat hit should n't . No , suh ! " Wythe sat for a moment looking anxiously out of the window . Then with a sigh and a shake of his head , he dismissed the negro boy and turned to Matthew , his face clearing to a look of friendlyinterest . " Your letter , I see , is from Mr. Randolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROOTS 61 " Yes , sir , at Shadwell , Mr. Jefferson 's place on the RivannainAlbemarle County . " " Your home is in Albemarle ? " " It was in Albemarle , sir , but I 'm hoping  --  that is , Mr. Randolphwas kind enough to think  --  that you might perhaps know of some surveying work . I 'm  --  " Matthew paused , casting desperately for some recommendation he might truthfully use . " Surveying ! " cried George Wythe . His face had changed , becomealert , keen . " Excuse me , sir , if I take time to read Mr.Randolph 's letter . " He broke the seal and read the note once , glancedshrewdly at Matthew and read it again , while Matthew surreptitiouslywiped a damp forehead . " Mr. Howard ! " The lawyer laid down the letter with a beamingface . " Your coming is providential , sir , providential . Indeed it is .

Have you dined , sir ? No ? We 'll go over to the Raleigh , if you will , sir , and I can tell you the details while we eat . And then you can go out to see Mr. Peyton this very evening . " As he talked Mr. Wythe had been gathering cloak , hat and stick . Now he took Matthew 's arm and would have started for the door , but the negro boy barred the way . " Marse George , you ask me to remind you , dat His Excellency clone ' vite you to dinner . " " Bless my soul , Jonas ! What day is this ? " " Dis Friday , suh . " Mr. Wythe was obviously disturbed .

It 's a boundary dispute , you know . You 'll find him pleasant to deal with , Mr. Howard , I 'm sure . You 'll leave him a copy of your report when you 're done , but bring your papers here .

" CHAPTER 4In Which . a Young Lady Near Williamsburg Changes His PlansANE PEYTON , thankful that her Aunt Clarissa 's eyes wereJ averted , yawned delicately behind her hand . The morning had been tiresome , cutting dozens of patterns of gray wool cloth , large size , medium size , small size , winter dresses for the field hands , which her aunt pinned together and laid ready for the women to sew . And now dinner was a disappointment . She had made sure when Lewis Burwell and Dick Corbin came riding in with Fleetwoodthat they would stay , and Dicey had sewed her into her new cherry silk , because neither of them was willing to let the lack of a few hooks and eyes stand in the way of a proper impression . Elm Hill was famous for its fine stairway which descended from the second floor to a landing and there divided to reach the east hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten designer that , viewed from either side , the curve from ceiling to floor seemed one unbroken and magnificent sweep . It was a stairway made for impressiveentrances , and Jane had descended to the west hall slowly to let the full effect of her new dress sink in , only to find that the gentlemen had ridden on , and the sole guest was Mr. Compton , the farrier called to look after Firefly . It had been no help to know that Dicey was peeping over the bannisters to see her young mistresstriumph . Jane yawned again , openly this time ; for after all , Mr. Comptonwas only a farrier and naturally people like that did n't count . Why were such creatures called men ? she wondered . He was droningon endlessly about sprains and spavins and springhalt , when there were ladies at the table ! It was enough to make her brown eyes moody under their winged brows , to shadow her proud little face . She and Dicey had even cut the one white rose on her window stand to pin in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she could escape with Aunt Clarissa to the library . There was something soothing in the delicacy of the eggshell cup that held her fragrant coffee , as there was in the sight of Aunt Clarissa , sitting erect in her winged armchair . From the tips of her buckled shoes beneath gray skirts , to the lawn kerchief caught with an amethyst brooch and the lace cap on her graying hair , in the " Jvery set of her head , even in the pose of the hand holding the coffee cup , Aunt Clarissa was perfection , thought Jane complacently , andshe arched her own wrist in imitation . Her aunt 's keen black eyes smiled . " That 's a right pretty dress you 've made , child , " she said . " Stand up and let me see it . Turn around . Yes , it sets as it should . You look every inch a lady . " Somewhere in the house a door slammed . " Every inch is n't saying much , Aunt Clarissa , " the girl laughed over her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ate always small , honey . " " Being precious articles , " came Fleetwood 's voice , " they'rebound to come in small packages . " He was standing in the doorway smiling at them both . " That 's a right pretty speech , Fleetwood , " his sister flashedback , " but I expect it really means that your horse doctor is gone and you 're ready to use your library . " Fleetwood limped across to his desk . " I have some letters to write , yet I would n't drive you from the fire , if you have some silent work you could do . " With a little grimace at his dig , Jane picked up her embroideryframe , but Miss Clarissa rose , taking her wicker basket of keys . " The girls brought over the laundry from the washhouse just before dinner , and there are ten pairs of sheets and twenty pairsof pillow slips to be laid in lavender . Every bed in the house was used last week . " " Without the fun of a party , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her aunt and then she leaned forward eagerly . " Fleetwood , before you begin your letters I have something1 just must say to you . " Fleetwood laid down his pen , and Jane went on a bit breathlessly . " It 's about Roger . " Her brother 's face grew hard . " Jane , the last time you began this , I told you -- - " " I know what you told me ; but , Fleetwood , Sally Randolph hashad a letter from him , and he 's left Richmond going west ! He must think you meant it  --  all you said . " " I did mean it , every damn ' word . This is no language for you to hear , Jane , but if you will bring up the subject  --  Staking the best colt in our stables on a card game , when he plays no better than he does ! With the New Year 's races coming on . It was monstrous ! " " But , Fleetwood , he could n't know you had Othello entered for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " 64 THE TREE OF LIBERTY " He should have known , honey . Othello 's the best horse we have . And anyhow ! To stake his riding horse ! Really , Jane  --  " " He would n't have done it , if he 'd had anything else to stake . But you took away his allowance . " " I certainly did . Damn it , Jane  --  I should n't swear  --  but the young rascal has to be taught not to play for high stakes . He 's  --  " " Oh , Fleetwood ! " Jane 's amusement had the upper hand now and the more her brother glared the more delightedly she laughed . " You ! " she gasped . " Preaching against high stakes  --  when you  --  " She was off again . Fleetwood grinned reluctantly . " I know . But Roger does n't play a good enough game to  --  " Jane pounced on the admission . " And how is he to learn ? Just tell me that . With you taking away his allowance ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert entered with lighted candles in a silver stand which he set on the desk . " A gentleman done come by the river , Marse Fleetwood . Say his name Mr. Howard . I lef ' him in th ' drawin ' room . " " Howard ? " Fleetwood was puzzled . " Howard who ? " " I don ' rightly know , Marse Fleetwood . He say he Mr. Howard of Albemarle and he mention Marse George Wythe done give him a letter . " " Of Albemarle ? George Wythe ? Why , Jane , it must be the young stranger who shared his room  --  Well , he 's certainly lost no time ! Was that surveyor with him , Uncle Robert ? " " Was n't nobody with him , Marse Fleetwood , but Toby brungup his bags , an ' he say they 's measuratin ' tools lyin ' on th ' wharf . I expect that the surveyor-man round yere somewhere . " Fleetwood nodded . " I expect he is . Jane , honey , wo n't you just come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow ? I ca n't be free , myself , until I 've shown him his work and settled him for the night . " Jane had risen and was puffing out the panniers of her new silkdress . " If you only knew what I 've been thinking all evening , Fleetwood ! Unless he 's cross-eyed and over sixty , your Mr. Howard will save my reason . So take as long as you like with your surveyorman . " She settled the rose in her hair . " The longer the better ! " she added . She followed Fleetwood 's uneven step out into the west hall , under the springing arch of the famous stairway , into the front hall and the drawing room , where she found herself curtseying to theDIVERGENT ROOTS 65tallest young man in the world . That was her first thought , how tall he was ; and then , what strength he must have to need such shoulders . For the rest , he had no powder on his red-gold hair , but she liked his eyes . He was properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something , for they were shining with gratifyingattention . He scarcely seemed to hear Fleetwood 's apology at all . And actually Matthew 's thoughts were so occupied with Mr. Peyton 's little sister that he really did hear very little . She was exquisite , was his judgment , lovelier even than the loveliest of the girls he had met at Shadwell . He had never seen skin so white nor color so like a wild rose , and her dark eyes with laughter in them were his mother 's eyes , for all the brows lifted like wings at the corners . She was not as tall and she wore a silk dress , but she moved with the same , sure grace . Not knowing just what had been said to him , he was obliged to bow silently in reply as Fleetwood left ; and Jane smiled encouragementat what she thought was embarrassment . " If you came by the river , you must be right cold , Mr. Howard . This drawing room is about as comfortable as the springhouse on a rainy day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm ? " She led the way along the hall , the glow from her dress reflectedin the polished wainscot by the candlelight keeping her companyon one side , and the tall silent young man on the other . When they had reached the library she indicated her usual place to the guest and seated herself in the great wing chair , spreading her skirts and crossing her feet in imitation of Aunt Clarissa . " My brother tells me this is your first visit to the Tidewater , sir . " " I 've never been below Richmond before this journey . " He spoke gravely , and waited with interested eyes for her next remark . " Well , now that you 've seen it , Mr. Howard , how do you like it ? " It was a light question , lightly tossed out , but Matthew chose to take it seriously . For some reason , it seemed important to explain to the dark-eyed girl in the big wing chair just what he thought of it all . He bent forward , his lean face earnest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know , Miss Peyton , that 's a mighty hard question to answer . It 's all so different . I like it  --  and I do n't like it . Oh , I like the things , houses like this , lawns with great trees like yours , that long bit of land reaching out like an arm to shelter your landing place , golden , dried reeds in water still as glass . I have it in mind I could like all the things . " It was a pretty speech , Jane thought , but did n't he see where06 THE TREE OF LIBERTY r DIVERL ENT ROOTS 67it was leading him ? It seemed almost wicked to spring the trap , but she could not resist . " Then what do n't you like ? " she asked innocently . " The peo-ple ? " He did not flush and begin to stammer when he saw the fix he was in , as Dick Corbin might have clone . His face grew puzzled , but he simply shifted his gaze to the fire . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matthew was thinking he could hardly tell her after all about the smirking innkeeper and the drovers who had failed to break her brother 's head . Tom had said Tidewater folk were queer in some ways , and likely she had never been anywhere else . It was past reason she could understand . He looked up at her with a smile . " How 's Firefly ? " he asked . " What ? " In her bewilderment Jane failed to add " sir . " " Your brother 's horse . The one that went lame . Was n't her name Firefly ? " To his delight she took him up as quickly as one could draw breath . " I know you want to change the subject , sir , but you 've chosen a mighty poor topic for your next discourse . " " Have I ? Why ? " " I 've just been sitting through a long dinner while Firefly was discussed from the whiskers on her under lip to the hairs in her tail , and there just is n't anything more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " Seems like I 'll have to try something else if I aim to hold your attention . " Jane nodded . What would a young man who talked like that say next ? " How about this boundary then , that I 've been sent here to survey ? " " Survey ? " Her laughter rippled through her words . " Then those measuring tools on the wharf were yours ? And Fleetwood left you here and went to hunt for his surveyor ! " " Is that what he 's doing ? " Matthew rose reluctantly . " I must find him , then , and introduce myself anew ; though for a fact , Miss Jane , I hate to leave such pleasant company . When may I hope for another chance to talk with you ? " " Indeed , sir , I 'm usually to be seen at meals , but whether I tarry will depend on the subjects you choose . Firefly , now  --  " " Her name shall not be mentioned , that I swear . But must I wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll find your brother , arrange tomorrow 's work and I 'll be back  --  " Jane shook her head . " You do n't know Fleetwood ! He 'll keep you busy till bedtime . " She held out her hand in dismissal . " I 'll wish you good night , sir . " Matthew took her hand and held it . He was not ready yet to let her go . " Be merciful and stay . I 'll talk to you of Albemarle . There 's much that would interest you in Albemarle . It 's not like this-here . My father 's place was on the side of a mountain . A sightly place to look from , up and down . And last spring there was a bear would come and stand to watch me hoe tobacco , for all the world  --  " Jane slowly withdrew her hand from his . " Hoe ! " she repeated in a puzzled tone . " Why , what  --  surely you 've never tended tobacco . " He stared in his turn , perplexed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tom 's silver buttons . Then he hastened to explain . " I may not look so , but I 'm a poor man , Miss Jane . I had to hoe my tobacco if it was to be hoed at all . " He smiled into her eyes . Of course , it was the fine green coat that had put her off  --  or had she meant --  With sudden gravity he put a question . " Do you think a man ca n't be a gentleman and yet labor in the fields ? " " But they ca n't , can they ? " she answered earnestly . " You know the sort of poor whites  --  " She caught her hands together in distress as the implication of her words struck her . " I do n't mean that you  --  not that I could have mistaken  --  I mean  --  Oh , I do n't know what I mean ! " Matthew could not help smiling in spite of the anger that her words had roused . She was very lovely in her distress ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , living in a place like this with queer folk about her ? " I have it in mind you do n't know what you mean , Miss Jane , " he said , " but I aim to teach you something about it while I 'm here , if you 'll let me . Now I must find your brother , since I 'm the man he 's looking for all over the plantation . " Jane gasped , made speechless by his audacity , and with a bow as easy as any Dick Corbin might have made , he left her , clutching the arms of Aunt Clarissa 's chair . Here Fleetwood found her , nearly an hour later , when he limped in and dropped into the other armchairwith a tired sigh . " Fleetwood , " she forced her troubled thoughts to speech , " that man , your surveyor  --  you saw his manners , but  --  he 's not one of us . " Fleetwood raised his brows . " Oh , come now , Jane . What gives you that idea ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He even said he had to hoe his own to- bacco if it was to be hoed at all ! " " The devil , he did ! W ell , I 'll be  --  " Fleetwood drummed with his fingers on the arms of his chair . " Whoever would have thought he was nothing but poor white trash  --  he even spoke Latin at the inn  --  I 'm deuced sorry , little sister , " he brought out at last . " It was a monstrous blunder presenting him to you , but I was completely taken in . I thought of course  --  and to leave you alone with him ! Did he behave well ? " " Ile behaved surprisingly well . " Jane raised puzzled eyes to her brother . " That 's just it . He behaved like a gentleman , Fleetwood , like a gentleman through and through . I ca n't make him out . " Fleetwood 's brows knitted slightly . " You do n't have to make him out , Jane . As you said , he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . They think they can learn a profession like surveying and push in anywhere , that 's all . Do n't bother your little head about him . But it 's a dam- nable mess . He 's here on my invitation . I ca n't throw him out . How- ever , it ought not to take long for him to run that north line if he knows his business . You might have a headache and stay in your room tomorrow . He 'll be gone by night and you need never see him again , honey . " Jane nodded absently . She was looking at her brother with new eyes , as he lounged in the chair . She liked the careless grace of his pose . Perhaps his shoulders might be broader , but his hands were slender , long-fingered , shapely ; not like  --  and his face calm , proud . There was something reassuring in Fleetwood . He looked so exactly what he was , an aristocrat . Sudden anger seized her at that other who had looked so convincingly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , she 'd show him  --  something . She was n't sure exactly what . She got up , and taking the rose from her hair tossed it into the fire . " On second thought , Fleetwood , I believe I 'll come down to- morrow . That man amuses me . " Her vindictive mood still possessed her in the morning , and might have lasted through the four days that Matthew was held inactive by a dense fog that rolled in from the sea , if he had not let fall when first they were alone again , that he had seen Roger . By the time she had found out all he could tell her of Roger 's health and whereabouts and plans , Matthew was well launched on the ridiculous tale of the letter of introduction and the dreadful image he had formed of George Wythe . Jane could not help laughing , and she had always found that laughter shared was a poor basis for vindictive action . Besides , Matthew Howard did interest her . There was his quiet assumption that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been so ludicrous . He was , of course , one of those who did not count , but the odd similarity of the motives that apparently dominated him , to many of those which controlled her brothers , made him seem strangely human . And his manners completedthe illusion . Altogether , before his departure , she could look forward to each encounter with him as to a scene in a well-acted play . When he was gone his impersonation of a gentleman lingered in her mind . The whole episode might have remained complete in itself and detached from ordinary living , as unreal as the background of fog against which it had been played , if Matthew had not come to the New Year 's ball , and if Fleetwood had not tried to take a high hand . There should have been nothing surprising in Matthew 's presence at the ball , for after all it was given at the Raleigh Tavern and any presentable young man could attend , but Fleetwood had been disagreeablystartled . They had arrived late and were hurrying up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage , Jane following with Miss Clarissa behind her , when they came face to face with the young surveyor . With a pleased exclamationMatthew held out his hand , and Fleetwood , betrayed by the unforeseen unwelcome nature of the encounter into action more extreme than really was required , lifted his quizzing glass and scanned the youngster up and clown , before he pushed on to the door , ignoring the greeting and the extended hand . The effect of all this on Matthew was what startled Jane . A wave of color suffused his face and passed , leaving it gray under its tan , exactly as if he had felt she affront and resented it . As he dropped his hand and drew back she caught his eye , and instinctively , as she would have made amends to one of Roger 's friends , she smiled and waved . Somberly , Matthew bowed , but though she passed so close her skirts must have brushed his feet , he did not speak . In the entrance hall Fleetwood was waiting with a lowering face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstart ! I ca n't understand you , when everything should be done to show him his place ! " Jane smiled at him impishly . Angered though she was by his tone , she would handle the matter lightly if she could . " Why , Fleetwood ! I told you the man amused me . You talk as if he really mattered . " " Your attitude at Elm Hill has made him think he does . There is no obligation of hospitality here , Jane . And I 'll thank you to remember you 're a Peyton . " Jane stiffened and looked at her brother with narrowed eyes . " I 'll not forget that , Fleetwood , " she said. 70 THE TREE OF LIBERTYShe walked into the ballroom shaking with rage . Fleetwood never seemed able to remember that a Peyton could not be bullied . She was a Peyton , sure enough , as she would show him ! When the evening was half over she had her chance . It was between sets and she was standing by the fireplace with Sally Randolph and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was leaning against a doorframe at the far end of the room and staring fixedly . She turned then to find Matthew Howard almost at her elbow . With a defiant glance at her brother she laid her hand on the young surveyor'sarm . " It 's right hot in here , Mr. Howard , " she remarked with her sweetest smile . " Ca n't you find me a cooler place ? " Silently Matthew presented his arm and led her to a seat by a window in the Daphne Room . Stinging under her brother 's insult he had quite made up his mind to have naught to do with such folk ; but when the young lady asked his escort he could hardly refuse . And she was so little , sitting beside him on the shadowed windowseat , so little and so anxious to make amends for her brother 's rudeness , it was past reason he should treasure his anger against her . She was different from her brother , he told himself ; and having made the distinction , it was easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , to enjoy her laughter , and the swift parry of her wit . Once , reaching to adjust the curtain that seemed to be in her way , he touched her hand and , seeing the swift color mounting in her face , he felt his own cheeks burn . By the Almighty , she was beautiful ! And not entirely spoiled yet by that overbearing brother of hers . In spite of the fact that all her friends so far had been these silken dandies , when someone else  --  With quickening pulse Matthew determined to see as much as he could of her . Afterward , Jane found it hard to explain even to herself why she had stayed so long with Mr. Howard . She had laughed with him and forgotten for the moment her spite against Fleetwood . He was right delightful , and a little dangerous , she added , remembering a moment when his hand touched hers . Danger certainly added spice to the delight . But to her aunt and her brother in the carriage on the way home she could deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular fuss ! " she cried hotly . " Do you think I could like him , really ? I had to get even with Fleetwood , that 's all . That 's all there is to it ! " she repeated with a vehemence aimed as much at herself as at them . The assertion apparently satisfied them for they dropped the matter , but with herself a debate went on , keeping her twisting and turning in : 1er bed after the candle was out . Did he matter , really ? She saw hint towering half a head above Fleetwood , and movingDIVERGENT ROOTS 71with the sureness of strength . He was strong  --  too strong , she thought with a catch of her breath . She saw his face , the level gray eyes , the set of mouth and chin . He looked a leader , and yet he was  --  She sat up in desperation and caught her head in its frilled nightcap between her hands . " Oh ! Oh ! " she whispered . " I wo n't ever see him again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her heart , but the matter was taken out of her hands , for Dabney Carr and Thomas Jefferson came to Williamsburgto attend college . Thomas Jefferson was a Randolph on his mother 's side , as well as Matthew Howard 's schoolmate , and Sally Randolph was Jane 's best friend . To most of the gatherings at the Randolph places the three young men from Albemarle were invited , and Matthew came whenever his work permitted . The very fact that he could not come as often as his presence was demanded kept him an interesting novelty to the Tidewater girls , and the quaint turn of his upland speech , the unexpectedness of his upland manners adcled to his popularity . " I have it in mind , " declared Sally Randolph , saucily mimickinghis phrase , " that Mr. Howard is a savage , but savages are sure enough exciting . " And this exciting savage made it perfectly clear that Jane Peyton , the first of his Tidewater friends , had not been dislodged from her pre-eminence . There was something flattering in the preferenceof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbingin the masterful resource which he used to gain a place at her side . The Williamsburg dandies might raise an eyebrow or shrug a shoulder , it was true , but Jane noticed they seldom opposed him . By early summer they just stood aside when he swooped down and claimed her , as he did one night at Tazewell Hall . She and Sally Randolph had been standing talking with quite a circle of the gentlemen . They really were enjoying themselves , but Jane had lain awake until all hours listening to Sally 's account of her latest conquest , and she could not help smothering just the tiniest yawn . She thought she had covered it entirely with her fan ; but Matthew shouldered his way to the front and , mendaciously declaring he had been sent to get her , bore her off to the garden . When she started to protest because there were no signs of those she expected to find there , he brushed her indignation aside . " You were tired of those silken sprigs , " he said , wagging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He spread his cloak on the garden seat farthest away from the house , folding one end of it to make a cushion for her head , and he talked right amusingly for some time of the work he had been72 THE TREE OF LIBERTYdoing for Rebecca Burwell 's cousins at King 's Mill , and then of the rivers and woods of Albemarle . She really had enjoyed the darkness , and his cloak , and the sound of his voice , until they came to go . Then as they stepped out from the shadow of the lilacs into the moonlight he suddenly halted and looked down at her . Slowly , fascinated , she was moving toward him against her will , when Mr. Jefferson appeared from nowhere with Rebecca Burwell on his arm . She certainly was thankful they had come just then . That night , tired though she was , she stood for some time at her window staring out at the sharp shadows cast by the moon . Matthew Howard was strange , she thought for the hundredth time , and dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have kissed her , and  --  this was the strange part  --  she certainly would have kissed him back . Yet she was n't sure she even liked him  --  very much . Perhaps it would be best not to see too much of him before the party she was giving here at Elm Hill . There was no knowing what he might do , if she went on seeing him  --  and she could n't have anything happen , after the fuss she knew she was going to have with Fleetwood to get him invited . She just knew Fleetwood was going to object when she waylaidhim the next morning on the columned passage between the house and his office to talk over her list of guests , but she hardly expected him to be so persuasively emphatic that Mr. Howard 's name must be omitted . She had come out from the garden with a basket of fresh-cut roses , and Fleetwood sat down on the floor of the colonnade to be on her level , his lame foot curled back out of sight , and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view before them . The grassy terrace was still dewy with the freshness of the June morning ; the shadows of the great elms lay cool on the sloping lawns , and over at the right the columns of the south summerhouse , twisted with jasmine , gleamed white against the giant pine on the bar by the landing . Beyond it all the river spread its wide dazzling plain . " He does n't belong here , Jane , honey , " he said . " All this peace . He 's a fighter , that man . " " He goes everywhere . They all like him . " " I do myself . He 's a likable fellow . But not here . He does n't belong . " And Jane , looking at her brother 's high-bred , sensitive face , had a sudden realization of how closely they both did belong to this dear house with its beautiful surroundings . All this which she shared with Fleetwood was quite distinct from Matthew Howard . In spite of the strange power he had over her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROOTS 73 " I can make it a Tidewater party , " she said dubiously , with no outsiders allowed , without Mr. Howard or Mr. Carr or Mr. Jefferson , but it would be mighty difficult to explain . " " I can see that , if they have been going everywhere , " Fleetwood admitted . " After all , Mr. Jefferson  --  we would n't wish to affront the I:andolphs . If only  --  wait , honey ! George William Fairfax is sendingmen to look over the boundaries of that Ohio Company , next week . Put off your party a fortnight and I 'll have young Howard . out of the country . " Jane smiled . " You can try it , Fleetwood , but I have it in  --  I have an idea he wo n't go . " " Wo n't go ! He talked steadily of Ohio last winter ! " " I know ; but that was last winter . I 'd be willing in spite of what you did to Roger to stake my riding horse that he has n't thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the wager she would have lost , for at that very moment Matthew was seriously considering Ohio . He had spent a long time after the party the night before with Tom Jeffersonat Doctor Small 's , and he was still indignant at remarks of Tom 's as he spread the lather on his face for his morning shave . " This bird of passage is settling down , " Tom had said and had laughed away Matthew 's denials . " There 's much to be said for it , Matt . She 's just such a lady as one would choose to set the tone for the plantation mistresses of a new country . There 's fine land in Shenandoah to be had . " Matthew had muttered that Ohio and not Shenandoah was his goal , but Tom would not be distracted . " One of the Frys abandoned a thousand acres of fertile Shenandoahland during the war , " he went on . " It 's outside the old county , but you might call the place Albemarle Hall ' so Dabney and I would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as I mean to build on my mountain . I 'll draw you the plans , Matt . I saw some fine ones the other day at the governor 's , work of an Italian named Palladio . " " Keep your fine plans for your own house ! I 'm going to Ohio . " " You protest too loud , I tell you , Matt . After what I 've just seen in Tazewell Hall garden  --  " " I tell you I  --  " " And Belinda may consider my mountain , if Jane Peyton if only a visting length away . " It had been easy then to turn him off to a rhapsody on the charms of Rebecca Burwell , the Belinda of his dreams , but Matthew still cherished resentment at the teasing . Of course he meant to go74 THE TREE OF LIBERTYto Ohio . He spatted the razor viciously on the strop as he reflected . All his life he had aimed to go to Ohio ; ever since the days when Uncle Reuben  --  Why ! he had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Torn thought he could settle down this side the Alleghenies  --  He seized the skin of his temple and slid the razor down his face , lowering his jaw to hold his cheek taut . It was a pleasant enough place to play , but he had work to do . Jane Peyton 's face in the moonlight was before his eyes . God ! What a beauty she was ! Abruptly he corrected even the thought . She was a fascinating playmate ; but no woman could interfere with a man 's lifelong aim . " Damn it ! " In his energy he had cut his chin . Finding a handkerchief he dabbed the wound while he seriously eyed the serious face in the mirror . There was doubt and a reservationin that face that must be dealt with firmly . What in God 's name could he do with an aristocrat for a wife  --  in Ohio ! And he was going to Ohio . " I 'll see George Wythe this very morning , " he told himself with an emphatic nod . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands . The weather 's fine now , and I should be on my way . " But George Wythe was out of town , and before he could return Fleetwood Peyton came to call . The two men had been meeting off and on , at the Raleigh , at the governor 's , at the races . Matthew had seen to it that coolness marked their intercourse , though Fleetwood had lazily tried to make amends for his discourtesy at the New Year 's ball . There were , therefore , no social preliminaries to be observed , and Fleetwood went at once to the business in hand . He had seen Lord Fairfax 's agent and nephew , and had recommended Mr. Howard for a place in the party of surveyors being sent to find out what changes the war had made in the lines of the Ohio grant . If Mr. Howard cared now to apply ? Matthew 's face flushed with astonishment and pleasure . " This  --  this is a great kindness , " he stammered . A recommendation from a Peyton would be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied . Even George Wythe could not get him a better chance to fulfill his lifelong aim . He should be entirely glad , but somewhere in his mind there was a part of him that was wary , that noted a vague tenseness about this Fleetwood Peyton . His usually musical voice was strung almost to a metallic pitch . " I owe you a kindness , Mr. Howard , " he was saying , " kindness , and an amend . You are free to go at once , I hope , for they leave on Wednesday . " The allusion to the slight at the New Year 's ball brought Matthewto a sudden check . This man had been afraid of him then , DIVERGENT ROOT ) 75afraid he would speak to Miss Jane , and he was afraid of something now . Did he want a possible suitor out of the way ? Matthew 's eye 's narrowed speculatively . " I 've always aimed to go to Ohio . " His voice was noncommittal , and Fleetwood Peyton leaned forward . " It 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new country , " he remarked significantly . " Not one to be lightly set aside . " " He 's mighty anxious to get me away , " was Matthew 's thought , but aloud he said , " When I go to Ohio , I aim to stay . " " Exactly ! " cried Peyton in a satisfied tone . " Then we can call it settled ? " Matthew stood up and walked almost unsteadily to the window , for his mind was in such a tumult as he had never known . If he went to Ohio on Wednesday he would stay , and he would never see Jane Peyton again . It was what this bullying brother of hers wanted . . . . Jane , last night in the moonlight  --  little Jane in a cherry silk dress with a rose in her hair  --  Go ! He 'd be damned first ! She might be an aristocrat , but his love would make her over . . . . He turned back to the eagle-faced man waiting in the chair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not now . Not yet . There 's something of importance must be done first . Mr. Peyton , I have the honor to ask your permission to address your sister . " " What ? " Fleetwood Peyton could not believe his ears . " I am asking , " explained Matthew patiently , " for your sister 's hand . " Fleetwood sank back in his chair . " Great God ! " he exclaimed . " Are you mad ? " Matthew had himself well in hand . " I know I 've startled you . But why is it so mad ? " " Is it possible , sir , you do n't realize that a Peyton ca n't marry a landless nobody ? " " Why , as to that , the first Peyton of your line was a nobody who made a name . My father made a name . Hit 's not known here , but neither is your name of Peyton known in Albemarle . And as to land , that 's fairish easy to get . What I 've put by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unowned land . " " My sister ca n't go to Ohio and hoe corn and cook like a nigger ! " " I did n't aim to have her do that . " Matthew still spoke patiently . " You 're right . She 's suited to a plantation . But there 's a thousand acres in the Shenandoah I can get . " Fleetwood rose to his feet. 76 THE TREE OF LIBERTY " It 's useless to talk further , sir . She would scorn you and youa acres in Shenandoah ! " " Surely you can see , Mr. Peyton , I must have that word from her . If you 're so sure of her , why should you be afraid to put it to the touch ? Give me ten days to go to Augusta Courthouse for the title to the land and after that let me see Miss Jane . I shall not then be landless , if that 's a comfort to your pride . " " Howard , you do n't understand . I like you , have always liked you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into the younger man 's face for a moment and then shrugged wearily . " If you must have this from my sister 's lips , sir , you may see her in ten days . But for God 's own sake , man , do n't take that ride to Augusta ! Your acres would make no difference in her answer . " But when the next day Fleetwood sent a slave to inquire , he learned that less than an hour after their interview Mr. Howard had left town on the same black horse he had ridden to Williamsburg . This information was brought Fleetwood in the office where he sat at his desk . IIe held between his lingers a note from Sally Randolph in answer to one of his , and his eyes were on the boxlinedpaths of the garden below his window . It was a bitter matter to swallow his personal pride , but there was a greater pride at stake . " Xenophon , " he said to the waiting negro , " I want you to take a message to Master Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involuntarily and then hurried to cover the ejaculation , " Yas , suh , Marse Fleetwood . A message to Marse Roger ? " " Last week , Miss Randolph says , he was at Carr 's Brook on the forks of the Rivanna . " " Yas , suh ? " Xenophon shuffled dubiously . " That 's west of Richmond , in Albemarle County . You 'll go to Richmond and ask the way from there . I f he 's not at Carr 's Brook you must follow him wherever he 's gone , Xenophon . I 've made out a pass for you . Tell him there 's trouble here , trouble for your young mistress , and bring him home . Take Firefly . She 's the fastest horse we have , now Othel  --  And when you turn toward home , ride ! " Xenophon rode , but Roger Peyton was not at Carr 's Brook and it was the morning of the tenth day before he clattered in , tired and dusty , with Xenophon at his heels . Fleetwood met him at the door as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library , where Uncle Robert served him with food and wine behind closed doors " Jane must n't see you until I 've had a chance to talk ! " " Jane 's safe , then ? " " She 's safe now . But before night  --  " Rapidly FleetwoodDIVERGENT ROOTS 77sketched the situation in regard to Matthew , from the mistake that permitted his presentation to Jane to the impending suit . When he had clone Roger burst into laughter . " Is that all ? Fleetwood , you 've evened up any score you may think you had against me . I 've been riding hell-bent for four days and nights thinking Jane was in danger . " " The fellow is damned attractive , Roger . " " Even if he is , Jane 's a Peyton . She may find him amusing , but marry him ? You may he crazy , Fleetwood ; but even after the lesson you 've given me , I 'd stake Firefly against a chinquapin nut that Jane is sane . Have you told her about it , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for you . " " Not a bad idea , considering all the fuss you 've been in . Now I tell you . We do n't want this fellow distressing Jane with his addresses . We 'll have her in here and let her write to him . I 'll give it to him myself . It 's a task I 'd sure enough enjoy , " he added with a trace of grimness . " Where is Jane , anyway ? " Fleetwood opened the door . " We 'll go find her , " he said . But when they stepped out into the hall she was already flying to meet them , a whirlwind of flying panniers and fluttering ribbons . " Roger ! Roger , honey ! Oh , you 're home again ! Roger , my dear ! " She had her arms about him and was squeezing hard . " Did Fleetwoodsend for you ? Fleetwood , you 're a duck ! " She looked keenly from one to the other . " I declare to goodness ! but you two are solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Fleetwood led the way back to the library and dragged forward a chair . " Sit down , Jane , honey . We want to tell you something . " She sat and clasped her hands in her lap . Though her eyes were still laughing her attention was theirs . Fleetwood hesitated in face of her laughter , but Roger with an impatient glance at his brother plunged boldly into the matter in mind . " That surveyor fellow you 've been having such fun with has gotten out of hand . That 's the worst of playing with people like that , Jane . They ca n't be expected to understand . " The vivid light in her face was fading to a blank stillness . Her voice when she spoke was level . " Just what do you mean by that ? " " He has asked me for permission to address you , " Fleetwood told her , " and he has insisted on seeing you in spite of my opposi-tion . " Jane 's clear eyes which had been fixed on her brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in her lap , while a wave of color rose to the roots of her hair . " Yes , he would insist , " she said in a low tone and she smiled a tiny , secret smile . " He 'll be here today , " said Roger , " but there 's no need at all for you to see him , honey . You can write him a note , now , for us to give him vrhen he comes . " She raised her head at that . " Did n't you say he could see me , Fleetwood ? " " I sai ' ; he could have his answer from you , but I agree with Roger , a letter would be far better than an interview . Here 's paper and a new pen . Get it over with , honey , and I 'll send him about his business . " " Oh , you agree with Roger , do you ? " The knuckles of Jane 's hands clutching the arms of her chair were white , and her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to order my life for me , but you wo n't find it easy to do . I wo n't write that letter . And what 's more , if Matthew Howard has been told he can have his answer from me , he shall have it from me , and not from a folded note you hand him . " She turned her shoulder to them , then , and sat looking out the window , her breast rising and falling under its lace kerchief , her silver-buckled shoe tapping the floor . Roger leaned forward aghast . " Jane ! You ca n't mean you want to see him ! " " I do n't know what I want , " she flung over her shoulder , " until I 've heard what he has to say . " Uncle Robert opened the door and intruded a discreet head . " Marne Matthew Howard in th ' drawin ' room , Miss Jane . He present his compelments and pray to see you . " Jane did not even turn , but because Fleetwood sensed defiance in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was flushed . " Jane , honey , " he began quietly , " after all , he 's no gentleman . Let me  --  " " Gentleman ! Gentleman ! " She wheeled about and her eyes were blazing . " I hate the way you toss that word about ! He may not have the family we have , but I 've found him gentler than some Peytons $ might name . And 1 ' 11 tell you this . I 'm going to see him and you two ca n't stop me . " She rose , and Fleetwood , too , was on his feet . " Stay where you are , Jane , " he ordered . " Show Mr. Howard in here , Uncle Robert . " Jane 's lips straightened to a thin line , but she sat again in herchair . Uncle Robert 's steps retreated along the hall and returned accompanied by a firmer tread . Matthew Howard entered quickly , but just inside the door he stood , checked at the sight of the two men confronting him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were defiant , but Fleetwood met his gaze gravely . " I asked to have you shown here , Mr. Howard , " he said , " because my sister can not have anything to say to you that can not be said before her brothers . " The young surveyor flung up his head and Fleetwood had a strange sensation that he was looking clown from some height greater than his added inches . " Is this the chance to speak that you offer me ? " A slow flush was mounting to his forehead . Fleetwood bowed . " If I thought your sister  --  " Matthew began slowly , and turned his head to look at Jane . But the sight of the girl he loved sitting white and shaking in her chair drove his thought from his head . With long quick steps he crossed to her and took her hand . " Miss Jane ! Miss Jane ! " he cried in a voice full of contrition . " I do n't know what they 've said to you to make you look like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that 's what they 've told you . I would n't think to take you there . I have a plantation for you in the Shenandoah . There are mountains , Miss Jane , on either hand to keep you safe , and a river  --  not silent like this one . It shouts over stones  --  If I only had words to make you see  --  if you could trust me  --  I would die to keep you from ever looking like this again  --  Jane  --  little Jane  --  " He was on his knee by her chair and now with his eyes on her face he lifted the hand he held to hot lips . At this touch Jane stirred . Her free hand sought the lace at her breast . " This is n't what my brothers expect to hear , " she said breathlessly . " Shenandoah ! The very name is strange , and you are strange , Matthew Howard . But no one could be as cruel as the Peyton men , and I 'm ready to go with you anywhere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was almost piteous , but Jane went on as if she had not heard . " Now , since they have forced us to speak before them the heart of a matter that should lie only between you and me , they can scarcely refuse us permission to withdraw . Will you take me to the summerhouse ? " And such was the white heat of her anger and her passion that her brothers stood aside and let her go . Roger dropped into a chair. 8o THE TREE OF LIBERTY " I 'm damned ! " he said . " I 'm damned clear to hell ! " Fleetwood mopped his face with the handkerchief he took from his cuff , and for some time he was silent . " You see , it is n't simple , " he said at last . " I feared something like this , but I scarcely thought she 'd go so far . Poor little fool ! " The door at the end of the room gently opened and closed . Miss Clarissa had come in from the side hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustled dismay as she crossed to the two men . " Fleetwood ! I could n't help seeing from my window  --  that surveyoris walking on the lawn with Jane , and her attitude is a scandal . It suggests intimacy ! " The pink in Miss Clarissa 's cheeks had becomerose , but her black eyes met Fleetwood 's steadily . " What have you two been up to ? " " I 'm afraid , " Fleetwood confessed , " we 've handled her badly . " " I should think you had , " declared Miss Clarissa grimly , " to have produced the result I 've just seen ! What do you think you 'll do now ? " " She 's not yet of age , of course , " Roger suggested hopefully . " Fleetwood could set his foot down and forbid the marriage . " " Perhaps if I shut her up in her room she might think things over quietly . " Fleetwood spoke dubiously . " I could deny him the house  --  " " She 'd only elope , " affirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't treat Peyton women that way , Fleetwood . " He flung his hands out in exasperation . " But what can we do , Aunt Clarissa ? We ca n't see her marry this fellow . " " You 're talking so loud , Fleetwood , I suspect you 've been playingthe bully again , " said his aunt shrewdly . " Did you stir up the Peyton in her ? " In spite of himself Fleetwood smiled . " The Peyton , " he admitted , " is most particularly stirred up . " " Then you 'd better make the best of a bad business , for she 'll marry that man whatever you do . But I do declare I 'm right disappointed in you . That two grown men could n't think of anything better than to bully that poor little girl ! Driving her to marry a creature without the first instincts of a gentleman ! " " Oh , come now , Aunt Clarissa ! " cried Roger . " Howard is n't a Carter or a Lee , but he 's been brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school with Tom Jefferson and goes in and out of Sha.lwell like a son . I saw that myself when I was there . He must have picked up something or Jane would n't like him . " " You mean he is n't poor white trash ? " " His people were poor enough , I expect , but his father servedDIVERGENT ROOTS 81with Colonel Washington at Great Meadow and was killed on Braddock'sfield , I believe . What I mean is , this Matthew Howard was right young then , and at the Jefferson home he 's had a chance to learn . " Fleetwood turned a relieved face to his brother . " You think , then , it might very well be worse . " Roger nodded . " I believe so . I would n't have chosen him for Jane , but since she has  --  well , to make the best of a had business , as Aunt Clarissa says  --  it might have been worse . " " At least , " said Fleetwood wearily , " we 've turned him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation in Shenandoah . ' " And trust Jane , " added Roger with a laugh , " whatever the poor devil may or may not be , his sons will be Peytons . " Miss Clarissa rose and shook out her skirts . " Roger ! I think you 're disgusting , " she said . But Fleetwood 's eyes met his brother 's with a smile . " That , my dear boy , is a thought worth considering , " he said . The wedding was set for the fall , when the roads would be best for the journey to the Shenandoah Valley , and a few days after his stormy interview Matthew left for the upper country to prepare the plantation of Albemarle Hall for its young mistress . " It 's a hard task to leave you , little Jane , " he told her , " but there 's months of work to be done in the weeks I have , at a time when the neighbors will be too busy to lend much aid . The Frys had fine fields cleared and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , but they moved away at the outset of the Indian troubles in the Valley , and all has lain empty and idle for four long years . " He hesitated shyly , looking about him . " It 's not much like this now , my sweet , but we can make it like , you and I. It stands in a sightly spot , with fine trees on the hills where deer come and look down on the house . There 's a fine , fair level with a little river in front , Buffalo Run , as clear as the crystal glasses on your table ; and when the grass is cut to make your lawn and we set out your garden , you can take pride in Albemarle Hall , though it is naught but a thousand acres . " " I 'm sure of that . But , Matthew , I do n't understand what would keep you there for weeks . Cutting grass is quick work . It 's certainly too late for the hands to set out tobacco . " Matthew smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact . But grain should ripen still . There will be a world of hay to make , and a garden . I must have vegetables for my lady 's table " 82 THE TREE OF LIBERTYWith that he had ridden away , leaving Jane feeling on a sudden strangely lonely in her own home . There was none of the flurry of preparation that might have begun even this early if hers had been the usual marriage . The linen already lying in her bridal chest was more than ample for the needs of Albemarle Hall . With Aunt Clarissa and Dicey she went over her wardrobe , and when a ship came in from England the horses were put to the coach and she was driven with her aunt to Williamsburg to purchase silk for her weddinggown , a hat or two , and such other materials and shoes and fans as the older woman felt she might need in the simple society to which she was going . The wedding silk was laid away with lavenderbetween its folds . " We 'll make it up a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give time for anything to mar its freshness , honey . You must look like a rose on your wedding day . " She turned her head away quickly from the girl 's sudden smileand on some excuse left the room , but not before Jane had seen the tears that filled her eyes . For a long time Jane sat motionless on the floor before her chest with the shimmering folds of silk in her lap , looking out through the window between the elms and down overthe lawn to the river , hot under the summer sun . It was so different from all her dreams . Her wedding was a thing acquiesced in , tolerated , but with disappointment behind the toleration . She sighedlightly . She was sorry about Aunt Clarissa , but when her thoughts moved on to her brothers the line of her lips grew straight and hard , She avoided them as much as she could , making her sewing an excuse for not joining the others in the library , and when Dicey 's flying needle and her own industry had completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a long visit to Sally Randolph at TazewellHall in town , and an even longer one to Rebecca Burwell at Carter 's Grove on the James . Rebecca had her own reason for interestin the upper counties , since Tom Jefferson made no secret of his devotion . In their big bed together at night the two girls hugged each other and talked in laughing whispers of the boys from Albemarle ; but when Jane tried to draw from her friend an admission that she would accept her eager suitor and come to Shadwell as itsmistress , Rebecca usually shook her head . " I do n't know , Jane darling . Tom is sweet , but so are lots ofother men ; Jacqueline Ambler , for instance . And Shadwell is a longway from Williamsburg . " It was . There was no denying that . And Albemarle Hall waseven farther . " But we 'd come down for the season in town , of course , " JaneDIVERGENT ROOTS 83declared stoutly , " and at other times I 'd visit you and you would visit me . Albemarle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills for deer and a great lawn by the river . " Rebecca considered this . " If it 's on the river we could get back and forth in no time by boat , of course . " " I 'm afraid they 're not both on the same river , " Jane confessed , " but there 's the Three Notched Road to travel by . " " Three Notched ! ' " echoed Rebecca . " That sounds positively Indian , Jane ! Are you sure it 's civilized ? " " It was an Indian trail once , but it 's a right good road now . " She spoke with more decision than she felt . She had never thought to ask Matthew about the Three Notched Road . Still AlbemarleHall had been a plantation when the Frys lived there , the finest in the Valley , so Matthew had said , and the road that led to such a plantation must be good . Summer passed slowly , days of stifling heat , broken now and then by thunderstorms that twisted and tore the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river to fury . Autumn drew on with the first hints of its glory ; it was time to take the silk from the bridal chest , and Matthew was back at last from the Shenandoah . He rode out from town one evening , bronzed with the sun and looking older and handsomer than Jane remembered him , somehow more of a man . The cold little doubts that had been lurking in her mind were swept away in a warm flood of joy at the sight of him . She was in his arms , with her head against his breast , and the heavy beating of his heart beneath her ear seemed to thrust ecstasy through every fiber of her being . Nothing mattered , nothing existed except themselves alone for the moment of that embrace . But presently 1latthew insisted on presenting himself to her brothers who , with Hiss Clarissa , were sitting on the east steps enjoying the breeze from he river after the heat of the day . He had come , he said somewhat stiffly , to report the present state of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the steps he told of barns rebuilt , hay laid in and the amount garnered from his late planting of grain . There was pride in his voice , but Jane angrily noted that her brothers heard him without remark . Only Miss Clarissa spoke , and she but once , commending Matthew for installing an old neighbor as a tenant in the smaller of his two houses . " I 'm right glad , " she said , " that Jane will have another lady near at hand who knows the customs of the neighborhood " 84 THE TREE OF LIBERTY " Mrs. Norton is a kindly soul , " Matthew assured her , " and 1had it in mind she would be some help to Miss Jane . " His smile at the girl softened for her the formality of his tone , but the face he turned to Fleetwood was grave , as he went on to speak of gardens planted and fields made ready for the fall plowing . At the end of the recital Fleetwood stirred slightly , but he still said nothing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small concerns and the season 's business at Elm I fill . To cover the stillness she began to chatter of her own preparations for thewedding . " What friends of yours have you bid , Mr. Howard ? " askedMiss Clarissa suddenly . " We must have proper entertainment forthose who may be long on the way . " Jane 's hands flew to her throat . Why did they all try to puthim at a disadvantage ? But Matthew bowed easily . " Why , none , Miss Clarissa , save only Tom Jefferson , who , asI told your niece , will be my groomsman . Dabney Carr is visiting atRosewell , but  --  " " I 've already sent him word , Matthew , " Jane put in . " My other friends plan to welcome the bride at Albemarle Hall . The whole countryside will turn out there , apter than not . " All evening Jane felt that Matthew was like a swordsman , steppinglightly right and left to parry thrusts . Late into the night she lay awake with a hurt ache at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the kitchen with a face rosy from hoursof supervision there . " I 've been looking for you , honey , " he said . " I lave you timeto spare me for a little while ? " Something almost like pleading in his tone caused Jane to check , he excuse that rose to her lips . She was angry , hilt if he had anything to say , she would let him speak . After all , she thought as she followed him to the office , they had only a day or two left to be together . Underlying the hurt of the last few weeks was the deeperpain of severing ties . On the desk to which he led her was a small box like a tinychest , of wood so old it was dark and smooth as iron . Metal bands bound it and the hasp and staple fastening was curiously intricate . Jane looked at it with astonished eyes . " What is it , Fleetwood ? " she breathed . He perched on a corner of the desk . " Open it and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her fingers . She lifted a folded square of velvet and uncovered a hollow filled with the glint of dull gold and winking lights . DIVERGENT ROOTS 85 " Oh ! " she gasped . With a smile Fleetwood spread the velvet and laid out on it a chain of flat links cunningly enmeshed , massive in effect yet delicate in its antique workmanship , narrow at the clasp and deepened to the front where it carried three emeralds , the largest , in the center , circledwith the white fire of diamonds , the two smaller set each with four brilliants in a design of gold , and all three held to each other by tiny chains so as to lie flat on a white breast . The large jewel was repeated in a brooch , the smaller in eardrops . " What are they , Fleetwood ? " " The Peyton jewels , " he said , " worn for two hundred years and more by the bride of the eldest son . Our mother wore them and they would have come to my bride , if  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things had been different . " " But , Fleetwood  --  " " I sha n't marry , honey . And last night while young Howard was talking  --  it 's a new family you 're founding that should have its traditions  --  I thought it over , and made up my mind to give them to you . " Jane 's eyes were brimming with tears . " Fleetwood ! " she cried , " was that why you were so silent ? And thought  --  I was right angry at you ! " She flung out her hands in a gesture of contrition , and Fleetwooddrew her into his arms . " I declare to goodness if she is n't crying ! " he remarked . " Here , stop it ! You 're spotting my third best coat . " Jane pulled his handkerchief from his cuff and laughed uncertainlyas she mopped her eyes . " There , that 's better , " he told her . " Now listen , honey , for there 's an obligation goes with these trinkets . The women who have worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight bravely even against odds , to play fairly , lose if need be with a smile  --  to cultivate beauty and gentle manners  --  God knows we fail often enough , but the ideal is to love what is high and noble and despise what is common and mean ; to build pride , Jane , pride that can sustain and lead . " " I know , " she said , and her head was high . " If you had married into another of the great families , it would have been easier for you , but no marriage can change the fact that you were born a Peyton . You must not be pulled down even though you are alone , even though at times Matthew Howard fails to understand . " " I wo n't he . Indeed I won't. " 86 THE TREE OF LIBERTYShe met his somber gaze steadily until he dismissed the matter with a light gesture . " Here endeth the first lesson , " he said . The wedding and the long journey up from the Tidewater were a brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late spell of heat had broken in a storm that lasted several days , and guests who were to spend the night at Elm Hill had come splashingin from the western courtyard or scurrying across the lawns from the landing accompanied by gusts and a violence of sound , but the wedding morning dawned clear with the crystal clarity that follows rain ; and from the moment when Jane started down the great staircase in her white silk dress with her mother 's veil on her head and the Peyton emeralds on breast and throat and in her ears , she entered triumphantly a world triumphant in beauty , gaiety and laughter . The morning sunshine slanting through open door and windows as she crossed the hall on Fleetwood 's arm seemed no brighter than the silks and velvets of the men and women who crowded apart to let her pass . As soon as she entered the drawing room , it was no trouble to see her bridegroom where he stood with Mr. Jefferson , for those two were the tallest men in the assembly , and surely Matthew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handsomest . The breathless solemnity of the ceremony was followed by two days of boating on the river , of riding in laughing parties through the enchanted stillness of the autumn woods , and two nights of dancing until the ballroom candles burned low and began to smoke . Jane led a set with the secretary of the colony , another with Speaker Robinson and more than one with the governor , who had a genuine liking for Fleetwood Peyton 's little sister . It was small wonder that she glowed and thrilled with pride . And on Sunday when they all went up to town to church she sat for the first time on the side of the square pew facing the pulpit , with Fleetwood and Miss Clarissa , a mere young girl no longer , but a married woman with her husbandby her side . They rode as far as Shadwell in the Elm Hill coach , head of a dwindling procession of carriages , since many of their guests were returning by that road , stopping each afternoon at the plantation of some friend for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last to leave them , turning off on Saturday morningat the road to Dungeness , her cousin Isham 's place on the James . Then at last there were hours of quiet companionship whey she could ride in the shelter of Matthew 's arm , with her head on his shoulder , a satisfied content in every tired breath she drew . At Shadwell she suddenly sensed herself on the threshold of the unknown . The house , though smaller than any she had ever been in , having only one complete story with dormer windows above , was nevertheless familiar in the beauty of its appointments and furnishings . Mrs. Jefferson and her daughters were graceful and charming , the chubby twins delightful , and Jane Jefferson looked astonishingly like her cousin , Sally Randolph . There should not have been anythingstrange about them , and yet there was . All through dinner Jane was conscious of something deliberately unspoken in the welcome these Jefferson women were giving to Jane Peyton Howard , on her way to take possession of her plantation of Albemarle Hall . It puzzledher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner that they try out the horse that had been brought here for her . " I have it in mind , " he explained to the ladies , " that she may be glad to learn his tricks before tomorrow 's long ride , and I 'd like her to see the sunset from Tom 's mountain . " Mrs. Jefferson smilingly agreed . But when they had crossed by the ford and picked their way between trees to the summit , the perplexity Jane already felt became something very like panic at the sight of endless miles stretching out and out to the east without ever a glimpse of the wide Tidewaterrivers . It was indeed , as Rebecca Burwell had said , a long way from Shadwell to Williamsburg . And yet what a view it was ! There might he forests there , but it was good , flat , tamable country and it would yield to men in time . She looked at Matthew , sitting on Ranger at her side , a young giant rejoicing in the strength of his eighteen years , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory in the taming of it . The thought steadied her . Then she followed him around to the other side of the hill and came face to face with a welter of mountains under the sunset sky . Her first thought was that here was a land no man could tame , and then  --  how still the mountains were , and how strangely watchful . Matthew was pointing out some spot where he had lived , but she could not heed , she was so busy summoning the forces of her spirit to stem the tide of panic rising now in truth . Sitting tense in her saddle she fought to control her fear . What was it Fleetwood had said ? Fight bravely even against odds ? She drew a long breath ; and , lifting her head , faced the mountains with level eyes . " And where lies Albemarle Hall ? " she asked . She was roused at dawn by the trampling of horses and the rumble of wheels , and raising herself on one elbow she could see through the window the shadowy outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were leaving her now , Old Eben on88 THE TREE OF LIBERTY the lead horse and the black boy behind , who had driven her on every journey she had ever taken . They were on their way home . Home ? Gaily she questioned the dark shoulder of the mountain be- yond the river mist . The fearful mood of the evening before was gone and in its place was eager excitement that could fling the chal- lenge of a smile at the unknown . Home lay ahead at Albemarle Hall . CHAPTER 5 Which Deals with the Beginning of a Family at Albemarle Hall THE mountains seen in sunlight were magical in their October coloring and the road with its ancient three-chopped blaze was a pathway to adventure and success . It was not the keen air alone that whipped the color into Jane 's cheeks as she rode with Matthew , now ahead , now behind the heavy wagon , drawn by four horses , which was carrying her chests and the sacks of grain and seed from Elm Hill . Each time they passed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the yellow-haired youth who had come down to Shadwell from Albemarle Hall to drive their wagon home . Home ! Home ! The word sang in Jane 's heart all day . She heard the first mention of Matthew 's family at the planta- tion of Mountain Plains , where they were bid for dinner and the night , since the ordinary at Woods ' Gap , though fit for the wagon , could scarcely lodge a lady . Old Mr. Woods caught her husband by the forearms and looked up into his face . " Lad ! Lad ! but you 're James Howard over again . And the little lady might be your mother when James brought her here a bride . A vast pity it is she ca n't see you both this day ! And your sisters . " It seemed such a warm and friendly greeting that Jane won- dered to see Matthew turn it hurriedly aside . His mother and sis- ters ? Somehow Jane had never thought of Matthew 's family , since he never spoke of them . Why ? Through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question hovered in the background of her mind , but even when they were alone at night she could not bring herself to put it to Matthew until the candle was out . Then he had little to say . " My father died at Braddock 's field and my Uncle Reuben with him . I had two sisters , Sarah and little Ellen , but last year when Sarah married , they went , all three , to Carolina . " " But your mother ? Did she leave you , too ? " " She , too . " After a pause Matthew spoke again with an effort . Li V r:K1 , EIN l ' ICUU " r6 ZS() " " ' T is only fair to say she IA ould have taken me with her , had I been of the mind to go . I chose to stay behind . " Jane lay very still . From the confusion of her thoughts one thing stood clear . Her strong young husband had need of comfort , for something painful was behind these meager words . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no family now , " he said finally , " but you , little Jane . " With a rush of tenderness she gathered his head in the circle of her arms , kissing his eyes and hair , and murmuring foolish words , until love mounting in a hot tide swept them both beyond the boundary of old sorrows . Her first view of the Great Valley the next morning , from the summit of the Blue Ridge , was of a world enchanted . A silver river almost at her feet , forests , parklike natural clearings , low , wooded hills basked in golden light , shut in by the mountains on which she stood and the far , guardian Alleghenies . Matthew had said there would be mountains to keep her safe . She held out her hand to him as he brought Ranger to her side . " Is Albemarle Hall on this river ? " " No , sweet . That 's the Shenandoah . Albemarle Hall is on BuffaloRun , ten miles beyond the Courthouse . But the neighbors will be meeting us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The neighbors ! On the road ! Call Dicey then , Matthew , quick ! I must have my hat with the plume , and the old jewels . I should look my prettiest to greet your friends . " With expectant curiosity Jane started down the hill , her jewelson her breast . The half hour of sharp descent was like the Elm hillstaircase of her wedding morning lengthened out , only now she wentto meet her husband 's friends , not those she knew , and Matthew'sfriends would have an amusing independence to spice their manners . A burst of musket fire shattered her calm , and three angularyouths in ill-made coats of black homespun rode out from the hushesbeside the road with smoking guns . As she quieted her shying horseJane looked for the gentleman who must be the master of these fellows , but none appeared . To her horror she realized Matthew wasspurring forward , hailing these uncouth oafs as friends . There was no proper deference in their manner as they crowded about her . They seized her hand , they even patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were her husband 's friendsshe could not voice her wild , shrieking protest . Knowing her dutyshe forced herself to smile , but she could not speak . It was as if anightmare held her . The brilliant tunnel of autumn color suddenlyopened to the high blue sky , as the road came out on a ragged clearing . The irregular level place certainly could not be called a field , for ) o THE TREE OF LIBERTYgreat stumps blackened by fire were almost as numerous as the shocks of corn . It had no proper shape . It just sprawled at the base of its barrier slopes , thrusting long fingers here and there as incomingravines made room for it . It was not even fenced . Part had been put to corn , as much more to something or other that had left stubble behind , and only a corner looked as if it might hay e borne tobacco . And the house where these friends of Matthew 's lived was a gray cabin no larger than a negro 's shack , a one-room lust with a chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes gapingblack beside their solid shutters . Even when she entered the forest again that waited beyond the clearing , Jane could not put those windows from her mind . What did these people do when it rained ? Did they pull the shutters to and sit in the dark ? Only in a nightmare could the people one knew live in such a place . Only in a nightmare would they say what the old man at the ferry shouted to Matthew with a shrill cackle . " However came you to pick so small a bird , Matt Howard ? You 'll ne'er get big sons from her ! " Outraged , Jane stiffened , but Matthew laughed merrily . " Lord save us , uncle ! " he said . " If I had taken a tall wife , my sons would bring down the lightning on us all , apter than not , scratching the clouds with their heads . I 've size enough for two , and this little lady will give me just the sort of sons I need , when the time comes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . Beyond the branches of the Shenandoah they were joined every few miles by groups of three or more , all figures of fun to Jane , women as well as men , the children sitting bareback , two or three together on one horse , each group announcing its approach with gunfire , or with thrill Indian yells that made her catch her breath in spite of her will . A considerable company waited for them on the main street of the Courthouse , but nowhere ( lid Jane see the dress of gentlefolk . Some of the men even wore hunting shirts . Desperately she strove to play the part expected of her . It should have been easy to be friendly with these people , they were themselves so merry , with the carefree joy of an unexpected holiday , yet she could find little to say . However , since they had so much to tell each other , no silence fell . But as each party fell in line by two and two behind the bride and groom , they pushed the Elm Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened and alone , even though Matthew rode so close beside her that sometimes his knee brushed her horse 's flank . He seemed to belong to these others , not to her , for he hummed and whistled softly to himself , and onceDIVERGENT ROOTS 91when the trail wound around a wide curve he pointed to the processionbehind them . " That 's a fine infare for any lass , " he said , and his face was so full of happiness that Jane could only turn her head to hide her misery . Suddenly there was a commotion . The procession stopped . Young men and boys were pushing forward . Some sort of race was on . Jane , being a Peyton , loved a race , but in this nightmare not even a race was recognizable . A man with a musket gave the signal , and two men pelting down the trail ahead were almost instantly lost to sight . At once the procession took up its way again , though with an expectant air . " They 've ridden for the bottle , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jane sighed wearily , and he put his hand quickly on hers . " We 're nearly home . " In spite of fatigue the word thrilled her , but such comfort as she could draw from it was soon destroyed by wild yells in the distance . Here came one of the racers out of the wood , lashing a dustcoveredhorse , and holding high a bottle with a white bow on its neck . " Will Swoope has it ! " Matthew shouted and the whole line halted . Will Swoope reined up before Jane with a tremendous rattle of pebbles and extended the bottle . " Present you Black Betty , Mis ' Howard . Wo n't you christen her with a kiss ? " Matthew drew the cork and Jane took a swallow before she knew the bottle held undiluted whiskey . Even while she strangled and gasped she was conscious that Matthew , although he steadied her , was laughing with the rest . Black Betty was passed from hand to hand down the line before the nightmare march began again . They passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing hardly larger than many they had passed . A log cabin stood beside the road ; and back near the trees , across a stretch that had been mown with a scythe , was a low house with whitewashed , clapboard sides , and a small porch before the door , a little house that could have been set bodily in the ballroom at Elm Hill with room to spare . It turned its shoulder to the road , and faced across its ragged meadow to a creek that chuckled sardonically over stones . It was only one story high , with a chimney at either end and a third at the back just showing above the rough shingles of its roof . Two logs split lengthwise and set flat-side-up formed the steps to the porch . Like all the cabins she had seen , this , too , had solid shutters with92 THE TREE OF LIBERTYloopholes in them ; and although they were folded back now against the house , they gave a grim look to each of the four windows across the front which glass panes could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark with untamed trees . Was that the place for deer ? More likely there were bears and wolves and panthers . Albemarle Hall ! It was just the sort of appalling caricatureJane should have expected . In a daze she let herself be lifted from her horse , then Matthew was dragged from her side , while women and girls led her across the meadow to the clapboarded house . From the added height of the porch steps Jane looked back for Matthew . Above the thronging heads that filled the unkempt yard she saw him standing beside a keg which was propped up on a stump with a spigot in its bunghole . He was drinking from a gourd dipper as if it had been the king 's cup , and laughing loudly as he drank . Behind him , dwarfing him and all his friends , the wild valley of Buffalo Run reached back and bark into the mountains . Jane felt her hand caught between two palms as hard and callousedas any man 's , and turned to face a tall , thin woman in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired face that had been delicately pretty once and that still was sweet . " Welcome home , Mis ' Howard ! Welcome to  --  " With a keen glance at Jane 's white face , the woman cut her greeting short . " Bless her little heart ! The child 's wore out . " Still holding Jane 's hand she turned briskly to the group about them . " The cook-fires are out yonder , neighbors , far side the house , and there 's plenty for each woman-person to do . Hit 's a far farin ' the bride has had , God knows , and apter than not , she 's danced in each house the livelong way from Tidewater . Whilst we make ready she needs a nap o ' sleep . I 'm Betsey Norton from t' other house , my pretty , " she said in a lower tone , " with as good a mind as your own to see Albemarle Hall is not shamed in its providin ' . I 'll watch the pots and spits myself , and iffen you trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm sure , ma'am , " Jane told her with a curtsey , " your oversightwould be far better than mine . " Mrs. Norton did not curtsey . Instead she stared . Then turning , she caught up a baby from the doorsill , smoothed his single garment into a decent position , wiped his streaming nose on a corner cf her fresh white apron and led the way into the house . Jane , her dawningliking checked at its outset , followed silently through a room of fair size but now filled from end to end by two tables of planks set on trestles . Mrs. Norton held open a door and when Jane had passed through , closed it gently behind her . Jane looked about her . This room was so small that the bedDIVERGENT ROOTS 93filled more than half its space . A chest of drawers and a three-legged stool on the hearth of the corner fireplace were all the rest of its furniture , and indeed there was room for nothing else . She sat down uncertainly on the stool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her cloak still about her and her plumed hat on her head . Deftly the negro girl turned down the coverlet and plumped up the ? illows , and then having taken the wraps , she helped her young mistressLo lie down on the bed , and stood chafing the cold little hands between warm palms . " You listen to Dicey , honey , " she admonished soothingly . " They 's a nigger outside done come with a letter fo ' you from the mistis at Shadwell . When you is rested I 'm goin ' let you see him . We 'll stay yere fo ' dinner , because I 'm hungry and I know you is , even though you don ' think so . But after dinner we 're goin ' take our wagon and this Shadwell nigger to drive us , and we 're goin ' home . These-yere is nothin ' but poor white trash , and Marse Fleetwoodwouldn ' want you mixed up with ' em . ' Deed he wouldn ' ! " Jane laughed softly . " Dicey ! Dicey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old goose , and if I were n't so tired I 'd hug you . But you must n't talk this way . Whateverhis friends are , Master Matthew is quality , and we 're not going to leave him . " " No 'm . " Dicey spoke dubiously . " But I don ' like this , Miss Jane . " " Run along now , silly , and see if you can help Mrs. Norton . In half an hour you may come back , and when you have me trim again , I 'll see the messenger from Shadwell . " Not even the rest , much as she needed it , gave the refreshment to Jane 's spirit that she derived from the brief note that the deferentialold negro handed her . You can not conceive the satisfaction it gives me , dear Mrs. Howard it ran , to be one to greet you on your arrival in your new home . And knowing that your garden will likely be your first concern , I take the liberty of sending you one of our boys who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to save you some of the mistakes I made when I began my Shadwell garden . If you can find work for him to do , he has permission to stay the winter through , but if not , you may send him back when he has your plot prepared , and I will see he returns in good time in the spring . That you may find the same reward of pleasure in your wildernesshome that I have ever had in mine , is the heartfelt wish , dear Madam , ofY'r h'ble obed't ser'tJANE RANDOLPH JEFFERSON94 THE TREE OF LIBERTYJane raised her eyes from the letter and the old man touched his forehead again . " What is your name ? " " My name Jeff , mistis . Marse Matt , he know me . I hob ) him put in er crap de first year he paw went to de war . " " Then , Jeff , I am doubly glad to have you here . " She folded the note and tucked it In her breast before she stepped out into the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shadwell had been a wilderness plantation . What Jane Randolph had faced , Jane Peyton certainly could bear , especially when her husband was Matt Howard . Since he was at the other end of her table , she could smile through the long dinner in spite of the fact that venison and bear meat , potatoes , cabbage and squash were all there was to eat ; even though there were not enough utensils for all , and the men made use of the hunting knives drawn from their sheaths . Pride in him because he was so different from these rough people , and the knowledge of his pride in her , sustained her through hours of strenuous , dancing of such reels and jigs as she had never known , and through which she was whirled by her muscular partners . Because of Matthewshe could smile and touch the gourd cup to her lips when she was called on to drink a toast in applejack , though applejack , that one taste convinced her , was worse than whiskey . She even smiled when the crowd of girls escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . They crowded into the tiny chamber to the point of suffocation and to the complete exclusion of the indignant Dicey , and they handed about each article of dress she removed , with exclamations of " My blessed mercy ! " and " Lord save us ! " The breathless fact of Matthew 's nearness kept her going through two days of such feasts and ( lances , but nothing helped much at night when he was asleep . Then strangeness seemed to rise about her in a cold dark flood . Not even Mrs. Jefferson 's letter , which she kept beneath her pillow , not even Matthew , long and young and strong beside her , could keep back the tears of homesick fear . To Matthew the infare was a complete success . All the good neighbors whose quality he had tested in the shared work of the summer had come to do honor to his bride , and many more whom he had never seen . The whole countryside , as he had boasted , had indeed turned out , and it stirred his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow-chested , silken idlers who had gathered at Elm Hill . There had been plenty of good liquor which held out to the end in spite of heavy inroads . Those who drank too much had slept off their excess , without creating the disorderthat might have marred so large a gathering . And the ( ) ugh itDIVERGENT ROOTS 95all Jane had moved , exquisite , graceful , smiling , easily the loveliest woman there . From the porch with her , he waved the last guest down the road out of sight , and then he took her hands and lightly kissed first one and then the other . " Do you stand aside , my sweet , until we set things to rights . and you shall have your first good look at your castle . " He whistled gaily while he removed planks and trestles , and brought down from the attic the table he had made for Jane , and the skins of three deer and two bears killed during the summer which he had cured to serve as rugs . The Nortons carried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl stood among her things , with more light in her eyes than they had held all the days of the infare . " Matthew ! " she cried , clapping her hands lightly together . " This room is beautiful ! " Matthew nodded . " ' T was meant for the hall of a fine plantation , " he told her , and the Frys built well . The chambers are small , but against we have good crops I 'll better that next year . It was for this room , Jane , I bought the place . I could see you in it , sweet . " She blew him a kiss from her fingertips . Her mind was busy with the room . It was perfectly symmetrical , the wide fireplace exactly opposite the entrance door , each flanked by windows , doors in the four corners leading to the chambers , and on one side the massive dresser , with a lovely blue color rubbed into the sunken panels of its cupboard doors , balancing the steep stairway that led to the attic on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and stairway side , unbroken from floor to ceiling , gave an effect of height , and even if the stair was too steep and narrow for great comfort , the balusters of its rail and the newel post were lovely in design . She called Dicey to take a sheet from her chest and measure its length to a window , and finding that one sheet , split along its center seam , would make a pair of curtains , she set out in search of Mrs. Norton for advice in the matter of dye . She had more sheets than she needed now with only four chambers to furnish , and dyed linen would make passable curtains until chintz might be obtained . She hummed as she walked across the yard . Busy days lengthened into weeks before Jane acquired any real skill at the strange tasks that she found were hers . " Her mother must be a poor makeout of a woman , " remarked Betsey Norton to her husband . " She had a right to teach the poor96 THE TREE OF LIBERTYchild what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangerfolk ! " William Norton took his pipe from his mouth . " Matt says her mother died when she borned her . Her brothers had the rearin ' of her , seems like . " " God ha ' mercy ! The poor little thing ! " But if Mrs. Norton was contemptuous of Jane 's upbringing , Dicey was scandalized by her young mistress 's present situation . She protested , vociferously and even tearfully , over each new occupation , until Jane was forced to take her firmly in hand . " You 're only making it harder for me , Dicey , crying like this , and if you go on , I 'll just have to send you back to Elm Hill . Then what would you say to Master Fleetwood ? " " Miss Jane ! Honey ! Don ' send me ' way ! " " I certainly will , if you do n't dry your eyes and listen to me . Master Matthew is trying to make a fine plantation here and there 's more work in this house than one woman can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nortons . " " Lawdy , Miss Jane ! That wouldn ' be fittin ' at all ! " " That 's what I say . So I 'll do the sewing , the spinning and weaving , and you attend to the cooking and washing and cleaning . And when it comes to grinding corn  --  it takes two people to turn that handmill , and I 'm going to help you . If you ca n't bear to see me , you can just shut your eyes . " With this the negro girl had to be content , although she made a point of hurrying through her share of a day 's work that she might relieve her young lady at spinning wheel or loom and send her out to ride . It was when she rode with Matthew over their thousand acres that Jane felt nearest to the strong young giant she had married . He was full of plans . He showed her the land the Frys had cleared and the notched trees marking the fields he meant to bring under the plow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " ' Twill give us the lumber we need for building . " " Building , Matt ? " He looked at her with pride in his eyes . " There 's but one room back there , " he nodded toward the house , " that 's fit for you to walk in , my sweet . We must push out the walls , and have proper plantation buildings and quarters for the hands I aim to get next fall , against I have a good crop . We ca n't work more than the Fry fields until we have more help . " Hands . Plantation buildings . Jane took fire at his enthusiasmDIVERGENT ROOTS 97When they walked together in the meadow by the house she could forget the rough stubble underfoot in the excitement of laying out the grounds . They were agreed on having a stretch of lawn from the house down to the creek , and the drive could he shifted down to the line of the old river road the Frys had made . If it followed the stream to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the front door and back in a long oval , it would make a right fine entranceand they both wanted that . Matthew was all for planting it with trees , not in front where they would cut off the view of Buffalo Run and the hillside opposite , but from the side of the oval out to the gate . " Elm trees , " he suggested , but Jane shook her head . " This is Albemarle Hall , not Elm Hill . We must have our own trees . " She looked about and up the mountain slopes where autumn colors still lingered in sheltered ravines . " Maples , Matt , an avenue of maples . Oh , do you suppose we 'll live to see them grown ? " " We 'll ask Jeff does he think I could set out saplings . Saplings grow while your back is turned , and there are worlds of them to be had for the digging . " " Jeff is behind the house driving stakes to mark the flower beds . Come along , Matt honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that saplings could be transplanted . " Dey 's many of ' em I'se moved , Marse Matt . Dess you take ' em in de winter when dey 's daid asleep an ' dey don ' min ' at all . " Matthew looked around at the staked-out beds . " I had it in mind you 'd want your garden at the side of the house , " he remarked to Jane , " like it was at Elm Hill . You could see it from the chamber window . " " I 'd rather see it from the hall . And besides , out there is the best place for those plantation buildings you 're talking about , away from the road and out of sight . " But Matthew it seemed had another idea . The plantation buildings , and especially the washhouse , the loom room and the smokehouse , should be on the other side , so that Mrs. Norton could have as easy access to them as Jane . It was on the tip of Jane 's tongue to ask whether it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to change the plan of the plantation to suit Mrs. Norton 's con venience , but then she thought it would be pleasanter not to have to look out from her bedroom on the working space . " We can plant grapes and train them over a trellis along the side of the quarters , and screen everything from the drive and the lawns , anyway , " she said . It was fun to be planning things together , particularly when98 THE TREE OF LIBERTYthey were building the proper setting for a seemly life . Jane thrilled to the thought of the future as she watched Matthew pacing off distances and setting pegs . And when the winter winds had stripped the last leaves from the trees even in the ravines , when Jeff had gone back to Shadwell and Matthew was out logging with the Nortons , she still liked to walk in the snowy meadow , to look at those pegs and dream . It was all as real to her as if the lumber were actually down from the hills and nailed in place . Albemarle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew was as set on making it so as she was . He was always at it . In the evenings or on stormy days he spread down paper on the table in the hall and worked out the improvementsin the house . She liked to watch him bending his great shoulders over the table , the candlelight shining on the waves of his red-gold hair . It really would be a pity to powder that hair . And his hands , she liked to watch his hands , so big and yet so deft with the smooth , controlled strength that was so much a part of him . He was pushing out the whole front wall , he said . Their chamber would be twice its present size and more , and the room across the hall , made equally big , would be the dining room , connected to the outside kitchen with a curving colonnade . He was drawing it now and balancing it with another such covered way leading to an office on the south . He surveyed the finished plan . " Would you like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here by Buffalo Run where the south woods come down to the stream would be a sightly place for one . With a fine prospect up the valley . " She came and stood behind him to look at his drawing . It was right natural to drop a hand on his shoulder . When he reached for the pen to mark the summerhouse in its place she could feel his muscles slide beneath her hand . How strong he was ! She was safe with him . She would always be safe . He had set his heart to build her a fit plantation and he had the strength to make his dream real . She had grown so used to watching him at work on an ideal that was her own as well that she was almost startled when he consented to take part in a house-raising . Quite as if it were to be expectedhe told her that Norton would drive a team of horses to help bring down the logs and he would take his ax . " Send Norton , of course , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand with the cooking for the men . But why should you soil your hands with such work ? " " Soil my hands ? ' That 's queer talk from you , Jane . " He took her hands and turned them up to show the fingers reddened andDIVERGENT ROOTS 99roughened with unaccustomed toil . " Are these hands soiled , then ? " She snatched them from him and hid them in the folds of her skirt , while the angry color rose in her cheeks . " I 've toiled for you  --  for ourselves  --  because we have n't yet got the slaves to do the work . But I would n't turn my hand over for outsiders . I send Dicey when they need help , as you should send Norton . " " It 's a strange idea you Tidewater folk have , " remarked Matthewreflectively , " that labor dishonors a man . Why should it be more noble to accept bread from Dicey 's hand than it would be to mix it up and bake it for yourself ? " Jane sighed helplessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't do  --  they -- oh , I do n't know how to say it . I certainly ca n't argue  --  but we 'll have to leave it to the others , honey , even here . To do things like that ourselves just is n't gentle , Matt . " " Are you sure ? I have it in mind that gentility is located further inside a man than his hands . However , we 've no need to quarrel , for there 's another side to this . Last summer how do you think I put in my crop ? Why , Fitzgerald and the other neighbors worked for me . I could not pay them . There was no thought of pay . Now that Fitzgerald needs help , I work for him . It 's a debt I owe , if you like . It 's the custom of the country , lass , and a fine neighborly custom I think it , myself . " He left with that , and Jane , with a feeling as if her knees were giving way , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to think about this . Snowflakes falling down the chimney struck the hot logs with hissing spats . She wished petulantly that Matthew would not call her " lass . " A custom of the country , he had said , and he thought it fine to be dragged from his own affairs to sweat for other men . She could not understand it . Was Albemarle Hall to stand alone in a strange and hostile world ? Outside the window , the snow , as if in mockery , was setting silly caps on the stakes that marked her garden beds , and through the veil of white the dark hillside at the end of the clearing loomed with a hint of menace . Jane lifted her chin . She could not understand this strange country and its stranger customs , but that was a good reason for making of Albemarle Hall such a plantation as need contract no debt of labor to its neighbors . And meanwhile , within the four walls of her home , she would make the sort of world she loved . As if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew , when he returned that night , was careful to accede in every particular to a whim of hers that frequently annoyed him . He doffed his huntingIoo THE TREE OF LIBERTYshirt , shaved , brushed his hair and tied it with a new ribbon ; he put on a ruffled shirt and blue coat with silver buttons , and handed Jane to the table as punctiliously as if a host of guests were present . And Jane with shining eyes smiled at him across the candles . He looked such a leader . He was a leader , and some day he 'd be a leader in fitter surroundings than this . She 'd see that he was ; if this strange country turned against him . On Christmas Day they kept open house for all the Valley ; and neighbors who had not seen the place since the infare stared at the blue curtains and waxed wainscot , at the silver and crystal on the great dresser , and at Dicey presiding over the fireplace in white apron and kerchief , with a scarlet scarf knotted about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were masked with snowy cloths , and in the chambers silken coverlets hid the homemade beds . Men in hunting shirts spat their amazement , and then , seeing Dicey 's vindictive scowl , attempted to rub out the offending stains with apologetic feet . Women stroked the bedspreads with the backs of toil-roughened hands and remarked on the heavy task it must be to tend so many rooms . But they ate with zest , and danced with abandon until long after firelight and candles in silver sticks had replaced the westering sun , and when they were gone Matthew and Jane went to bed in tired triumph . Next morning at breakfast he told her that Albemarle Hall had taken its place in the county now and likely she would begin to see something of the neighbors . Sure enough , hardly a day went by but some traveler rode the ten miles front the Great Road to claim shelter and a bed , and in stormy weather he might stay for days . When court was held at the Courthouse every bed was full , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late corners that Jane was glad of all the bedding she had in her chests . The talk of these neighbors increased her feeling that AlbemarleI-Iall was set down in a strange world . Little was ever said of governor or burgesses ; and the merrymaking at Williamsburg , that had always been the center of her life , figured not at all . Instead there was the question whether lacing a man 's jacket nineteen to the dozen was too heavy a penalty for failure to appear when work at the fort was forward , and an endless discussion whether scouts should he sent to the Indian country , or whether the red devils could be trusted to keep the peace their chiefs had made . There was much gossip of ' courtings and marriage , much boasting of prowess in tracking and axwork , much railing at quit-rents and tithes , and there were old songs by firelight to while away the after-supper hours  --  one man 's voice lifting the verses : " As I was a-walking on fair London street , A beautiful damsel I chanced for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaningless yet haunting refrain : " Woeful lallidee , woeful lay , folallillo day , And it 's woeful lallidee . " Matthew and Norton between them trapped twenty old wolves that winter in the mountains west of Buffalo Gap , and the bounty paid at Augusta Courthouse was equal to a fine crop of tobacco . " A hundred and forty pounds of first-grade leaf for each wolf scalp ! " Matthew exulted . " Here 's what will get bricks for our chimneys . " " And perhaps build the wall I want for the fruit trees , between the flowers and the vegetable garden , " coaxed Jane . " That , too , my sweet . " Her mind was full of the gardens , for spring was coming and Jeff was back from Shadwell with bulbs and seeds and cuttings . He was bringing rhododendron down from the hills about the house and little red cedars to set out in rows and dogwood and Judas trees to plant in corners , and with the first warm days the beauty she had dreamed grew real . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties as hostess and her work at spinning wheel and loom , watching his tricks of planting and transplanting , his loving tendingof the soil he brought from the forest to enrich his flower beds , soil as black as his own black hands , learning from him when to support and encourage a slender outreaching shoot , and when to nip it that a stronger might follow . Matthew , when he came in from the fields at dusk , never failed to saunter among the new-made beds , or down the rows of sprouting peas and beets , onions and feathery carrots , to the hills of cucumbers . It fed his pride that such things should be growing in Matt Howard 's garden , and it amused him to watch the Nortons , who at first had been inclined to laugh at such alterations to the usual truck patch . After stoutly maintaining corn and beans , cabbage and squash were good enough for anyone , they had become steady consumers of the strange delicacies . They had not yet reached a stage where they would admit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden was not Matthew 's only reason for pride . In the caravan of produce sent from the Valley down the Three Notched Road to Richmond that fall , Albemarle Hall made a fine showing . Restored by years of rest , the fields the Frys had cleared yielded six casks of tobacco and a wagonload of wheat . He was going with the train to do his trading , and it had been his plan to take JaneIO2 THE TREE OF LIBERTYwith him for a short visit at Elm Hill , but when October came her condition was such that a jaunt of three hundred miles on horseback , to the Tidewater and back , was out of the question . " It would n't be safe , Matt . " " I suppose not , " he admitted . " Well , I must just get through our business as fast as I can , but likely I 'll be gone four weeks . " She smiled bravely at him but her arms clung in their last embrace , and he felt her body trembling . His heart smote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little , different -- and alone . He rode with a thoughtful face all the first day beside the slow-moving caravan , unable to put her loneliness out of his mind . He had to think of something to do about it ; and on the second morning , after a conference with Norton who was driving the wagon , he set out ahead from the camp and pushed Ranger forwardat his very best pace . Three days later , Jane , hearing a clatter of hoofs in the yard , laid aside her sewing with a sigh . Without Matthew , entertaining these neighbors of the Valley was doubly difficult , but she summoned a smile as she opened the door , to find a young lady being lifted from her horse by a black servant . This was astonishing enough , as was the sight of the negro maid sitting on the pillion behind the man 's saddle , but when the lady let fall her hood and revealed the laughing face of Betty Jefferson , Jane gave a cry of joy . This sister of Tom 's who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brief stay at Shadwell . Running up the steps Betty gathered her in a warm embrace . " Matt told us you were here alone , " she explained , " and as there is always an oversupply of females at home mamma sent me to make you a visit . I 'm to stay till Matt gets back and then Jeff can carry me home . My dear ! How pretty you look ! Marriage agrees with you . You do n't mind my bringing Seraphim , do you ? I thought she could help with the sewing . Matt said you were sewing . " At first Jane could only stand holding the other girl 's hands , laughing with delight at the stream of chatter , such as she had not heard for a year , then she slipped her arm about Betty 's waist and led her inside . " I 'm so glad to see you I 'm tongue-tied , " she said , " and I expect Dicey will feel the same way about Seraphim . You dear ! I have it in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything you do or say . " Certainly Betty Jefferson had the loveable gift of knowing the right thing to say and do , for she exclaimed at once over the beauty of the hall . " You 'd have to travel to James River to find another suchDIVERGENT ROOTS I03room , " she declared , " and your curtains will set a fashion , I vow they will . " She set Seraphim to assisting Dicey and threw herself with such enthusiasm into Jane 's activities that work which Jane had thought would take half the winter was soon completed and laid aside . And as they knitted and sewed and embroidered the two girls chattered and laughed in a light-hearted freedom that Jane had almost forgotten . They walked in Jeff 's garden , and Betty was in raptures over the rugged hillside at its end . " ' T is a far finer setting for a garden than we could ever have at Shadwell . " On evenings when there was no company they pored over Matthew 's plans for the enlarged house , counted windows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains . Jane was pushing her preparations forward , that the process of settling might be quickly done when the construction was complete . " I should like to keep open house at Christmas with a proper place to eat , and the cooking done outside the hall for once . This looking graceful and unconscious while the soup boils over , or when a man hangs his cloak to dry where it can drip on the entire supply of corn bread , certainly is a strain . " " And of course , " said Betty solemnly , " there 's no other reason for haste . " Then the two would laugh delightedly as if at a clever jest . When Betty rode back to Shadwell Jane felt that something bright , young and revivifying had gone with her . But Matthew was back with two field hands , and a man and his wife whom he had bought for gardener and cook , and there was little time to think . The work of preparing the lumber went rapidly forward . There were three hectic days of house-raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house went up as if by magic . The kitchen followed , with its passage , the washhouse , the smokehouse and the long six-room quarter for the house servants ; and all in the time it took the two field hands to build their one cabin in the north field beside the barns . Hog-killing time overlapped the first of the preparations for Christmas , and Jane found the weeks of excitement and more or less breathless exertion more and more difficult to bear . Mrs. Norton , drawing on her own experience , assured the girl that her time would be easier if she worked hard to the end , and desperately she strove to meet the harsh frontier standard , although her strength seemed to ebb as her body grew heavier . Christmas Day was one long test of her courage , from young104 THE TREE OF LIBERTYMrs . MacPherson , who pityingly remarked that Matt Howard 's child would likely be a large one , to old Widow Evans 's long account of how she was brought to bed in an Indian attack and was lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the redskins forced the front . Jane naturally was not dancing and so could not escape from the long recital that spared her no detail of the confinementin the straw of the wagon bumping along a trail between the river and Swift Run Gap . She said nothing of all this to Matthew , but she clung to him that night with a desperation that he laid to fatigue , and two nights later she woke him , begging that he go for Mother Bell . At first he was inclined to demur , urging that her time would not come for several weeks , but Jane persisted . " I know something it wrong . " He lit the candle at that and saw her face was swollen and strangely flushed . Racing motion on Ranger 's back was some relief , but it could not outpace the wild , indefinite fear that took icy shape when he came back , to find Jane lying with closed eyes and limp , waxen hands , her damp hair pushed back from that strange distortedface . Old Mother Bell made light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to lie down on a bed in one of the empty rooms . " There 's naught you can do , Matt . Get a nap o ' sleep if you can , and against we have the child to lay in your arms we 'll wake you . " " Do you think she 's all right ? She looks  --  " " A bornin ' woman always looks queer in face , but she 'll come pretty-favored again as soon as ever the child is here . Never fear ! " He paced the hall up and down and across , stopping now to finger the blue curtains she had made , now to stare at the silver candlesticks she loved , and to think of that first evening at Elm Hill when she had come to him in her cherry silk dress . He was standing so , just before dawn , when Mrs. Norton hurried from Jane 's room to tell him to ride to Augusta Courthouse for Mrs. Henderson or any other midwife he could find . " Is she in danger ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 've a right to hurry , Matt , " was all she said . Grim fear blurred the hours . He rode and came again , with Ranger coughing under him , and a little old woman on the pillion behind . He sat on a stool in the hall by the fireplace , while the day that had come as he rode grew to noon and faded again to night . Sukey brought food and placed it beside him , but it was untouched . DIVERGENT ROOTS IO5Old women , horrible , imperturbable , came , made vile-smelling brews , and went again . Once and once only he had gone to the door of the chamber . Dicey was crouched at the side of the bed , sobbing . There was a faint , sickish scent of blood on the air . He could not see Jane , but he heard the hoarse , unhuman breathing of her pain , and he fled to the fireplace again . Strange thoughts bore him company . His mother had suffered once like this to give him life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered again when he had cast her off  --  he had done that in sinful , heedless rage  --  in the firelight now he could see her face , her stricken eyes  --  Jane had his mother 's eyes , and now  --  was this the requiting of his sin , this loss of Jane that , even as a menace , numbed his very soul ? " God ! Do n't let her die ! Dear God ! Do n't let her die ! " A weak , indignant wail from the inner room brought him to his feet , and so he stood waiting for hours , it seemed to him , until Mrs. Norton looked out of the door and beckoned him to come . Jane turned her head to greet him with the ghost of her mischievoussmile . " Well , Matt , I may be little , but I 've borne your son . " She gestured weakly to the fireplace , where Mother Bell sat bending over a bundle in her lap . Matthew 's eyes followed her gesture for a brief glance and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously . " How  --  how are you ? " he asked . Jane giggled delightedly . " Very well , I thank you , sir , but a thought wearied by my day 's work . Go look at your son , silly , and then come kiss me good night . I do need rest , and so , I expect , do you , " she added tenderly . Hot tears stung Matthew 's eyes . To hide them he turned to the group by the fire . Later he was to remember the serious faces of the women , but at the time all his attention seemed fixed on the blanket stirring uneasily in Mother Bell 's lap . The old woman lifted a corner and at the same moment the baby opened its eyes , the intent yet sightless eyes of the newborn . For a shocked instant Matthew thought that Fleetwood Peyton was staring at him from the shadowed hollow , through a mask incredibly wrinkled and old . There was the same dark hair , the fine-penciled brows that lifted like wings at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh the baby closed his eyes and thrust out a groping hand . InstinctivelyMatthew put out his own and the tiny fingers closed tightly on his thumb . A thrill of pride tingled from the contact . " Jane ! He has a grip on me . And the strength of him ! You 'd never believe ! " Io6 THE TREE OF LIBERTY " Set your feet firmly , Matt . Do n't let him throw you . " Her voice echoed his pride . With a sudden gesture the baby flung out his arms and the blanket about him fell apart . Drawn up against his round , bandaged body were two mottled red legs , and one ended in the crumpled deformity of a clubfoot . Slowly Matthew drew his thumb from his son 's clasp . Here was requiting indeed for his sin against his mother . On the hearth was a bowl of water with a cloth hanging over its edge . Water dripped from its fringed end with a soft steady beat . Mrs. Norton had her finger on her lips . The fool ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking Jane 's hand , kissed it once and again . " I have it in mind we 'll name him Peyton , " he said , and his voice was under perfect control . " Hit 's a good name and hit 's your people he favors . " To Jane the baby 's deformity when she came to know of it was hardly more than a reason to fold him closer . She was slow to lay him down when he had fallen asleep at her breast . She liked to lift him up until his head was in the hollow of her neck while she dreamed of the years ahead of him with her cheek against his soft dark hair . He was a Peyton , every inch of him , bless his heart , even to his crumpled foot . And as he grew he had the Peyton grace in the way he used his little hands and in the set of his head . On the few times when she thought at all of his lameness she was sure he would manage it as unobtrusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness to the hint of the child 's need , she could not even imagine the elemental disgrace that a son 's weaknessmight be to a man . For her sake , Matthew tried to hide his inward shrinking , and while the baby wore long skirts that covered his feet it was fairly easy to cuddle and caress him , especially since he soon developed a preference for his father that made him quiet and content in the crook of Matthew 's arm , no matter how fretful he might have been with the women . Matthew could hug the child to him ; then , with the explanation that as men they understood each other , and take comfort in the baby 's smile . But when the youngster began to crawl , which he did early , hitching himself along by his good leg and one arm , in a sitting position and with astonishing speed , Matthew could not bear the sight of the useless foot that dragged behind . Obscurely , as on the night of the baby 's birth , he felt it a reproach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned only when he was sure the child would be in bed , and on stormy daysDIVERGENT ROOTS I07he tried to bury himself in his books . That fall when he built the office he even added a second story to the house with a big upper hall for nursery and schoolroom , that Peyton as he grew might be out of his constant sight , though he hardly admitted the reason even to himself . Then one night when he watched the child , in an unguarded moment Jane saw his face . " Matthew ! " she cried . " What is it ? What makes you look like that ? " He tried to avoid an answer , and when she persisted he softened it as best he could . " It 's just that my heart aches to think he can ne'er be a leader , Jane . A man must always want to be a leader . " All Jane 's dreams for the child flooded in on her . " And why not ? " she cried . " My brother Fleetwood is lame like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that ! " " Yes , but he was not here in the Valley . It takes a man  --  " He stopped abruptly , hoping Jane had not heard . But she caught up the challenge . " He can lead among gentlemen ! " In defense of the child she struck at him . " And we must see that there is where he lives ! " It was 2. retort drawn out , he felt , by his clumsiness , and he did not reply , turning his mind from the steely ring of anger he heard for the first time in her voice . But discord had entered their relationship , and small things , unnoticed before , came between them . He had less patience with the whim that he should shave and change his dress after a tiring day in the fields . She had less inclination to find the manners of his backwoods friends amusing . In trifles the old harmony was gone and when a real issue arose they were in a poor situation to come to any understanding . Three men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming shelter in the name of an old friendship with Matthew . Jane mistrusted their looks from the first , and when in the course of their effort to entertain her they embarked on tales of smuggling and fights with government men , she made some excuse to leave them well supplied with cakes and cider , and hurried out along the river road to meet Matthew before he could reach the house . But Matthew interrupted her recital with a laugh . " It must be old man Dunkel and his boys . You 've no call to be afraid of them , my sweet . But perhaps it would be well to put down mattresses by the fire for them tonight . We can easily sun mattresses and they wo n't expect beds . " " Beds , Matthew ! You ca n't mean to shelter these creatures ! are n't you going to give them over to the law ? " I08 THE TREE OF LIBERTY DIVERGENT ROOTS 109A dull red crept up Matthew 's cheeks . " I 'm not an informer , Jane . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't understand  --  " He brushed aside her protest . " I have it in mind there 's much you do n't understand , Jane . Let 's not waste words . It must be time for dinner . " Jane 's voice was as level as his . " You may go on to entertain your guests , sir , I 'll stay at the office . There 's a fire there , and Dicey can bring me bedding . I 'll not share roof or food with such as they ! " Matthew bowed ironically . " As you please , madam , " he said , and swinging to his saddle he cantered on to the house . But before the evening meal was over his anger had cooled . After all , as Jane herself had said , she did not understand . She could not know that the name of informer was the ultimate insult . When the three Valley men were settled in their blankets , he went out to the office . But reaching a common ground with Jane was difficult . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who had served you and your father before you , " she admitted , " but what I can not understand is how you ever came to deal with them . Smugglingis stealing , Matthew , stealing from the king . " " I have it in mind if the king knew what goes on in his name , hit 's not the smugglers he 'd send to jail . I know how it looks at Williamsburg . Government to you is the Governor 's Assembly , or Birth Night Ball at the palace , but government as I 've known it on an upland farm is a thing to be fought with all the strength a man has . " " Abuses should be fought , of course , but always with honor . And ca n't you see , Matt , that stealing  --  smuggling  --  is n't honorable ? " " No , " said Matthew stubbornly . " I ca n't ; and neither could you if you had been placed as we were . " " Oh ! " Jane 's voice was despairing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not understand . Your ways are n't my ways , and I ca n't make them so . " The muscles were twitching under Matthew 's cheeks , but he spoke quietly . " And I suppose your brother advised you to hold to your own ways ? " " Of course he did , but he certainly did n't need to . I 'm just as much a Peyton as he is . " Suddenly her eyes filled with tears andshe flung out her hands . " Oh , Matthew ! " she pleaded . " Ca n't you see ? " " I see a number of things , " he said bitterly , but he took her hands , and after a moment he went on with an effort . " And one is , that we have talked till you are very tired . Come back with me to your own bed now . You may stay in your room in the morning till my friends are gone . And when I entertain smugglers in the future I shall not expect your help . " Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He talked of honor , yet he could set a bride against her husband . Well , he should not succeed in keeping Jane 's allegiance . He had piled obstacles in the way , but Matt Howard would win his wife . Beginning the next day , he set himself to woo her mind with a more deliberate intention than he had brought to his first courting of her in Williamsburg . Much that he had done himself the spring before he now left to William Norton , that he might have more time with her ; and as they rode and walked or sat in their new summerhouse while the days grew warmer , he talked of their neighbors . There were hero tales aplenty that should appeal to her proud spirit behind the homespun awkwardness that offended her . If he could just make her seeJane listened with shining eyes . It was very plain to her that the Lewises and the Swoopes , the Fitzgeralds and the rest were dear to her strong young husband . If it pleased Matthew that she should admire them she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor things , they certainly had need of such virtues , with the strange life they led . But if Matthew 's interpretation could begin to reconcile Jane to the frontier people , there was no one who could teach the frontier people an appreciative understanding of Jane . At first , her habit of riding through the bitterest weather with her kit of medicines , whenever she heard of illness , made her many friends . The neighbor women , anxious to return her kindness and ready to overlook much in view of her pitiful upbringing , reported to them by the Nortons , often rode miles to give suggestions and " lend a hand . " But when Jane refused their help in accordance with her vow to contract no debt of labor that the strange custom of the country might require her to repay , when she failed to return their visits , they gradually took offense . They could scarcely call her unneighborly , for she always sent Dicey with a plentiful supply from the Albemarle Hal ! , smokehouse and gardens to every harvesting or house-raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought her queer , and little by little they left the visiting to the men . They came when theIIo THE TREE OF LIBERTY plantation held open house at Christmastime , and they came when Jane was brought to bed the second time to offer what help they could , but otherwise the very weight of her kindness which she would not let them balance by kindness of their own turned their gratitude into a sense of obligation from which they took refuge in contempt . The weak little outland woman was a poor makeout , for all her fine ways , they said , and she with a crooked first child and her second naught but a girl . And when this judgment of herself and her children came to Jane 's ears at last through a remark overheard at the third Christ- mas gathering it hardened her old fear of the frontier into an active hate , which no explanation of Matthew 's could soften . At one blow it wrecked the little patience and understanding that he had been painfully building in her mind for two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . Albemarle Mall must be brought to the state where it might be left with William Norton as overseer and agent in charge . Because of the strengthening of the bond be- tween them , which Matthew had accomplished , and because of the child she was again carrying , she included Matthew in her dreams , but those dreams were all of leaving the frontier , of returning to Elm Hill . She could argue at least to her own satisfaction that Fleetwood and Roger needed her , for word had come that Aunt Clarissa had suffered a stroke of paralysis which had rendered her whole right side useless . After a winter and spring of complete quiet she had recovered sufficiently to be lifted into a wheeled chair , which her faithful Posey would have pushed all around the plantation if her mistress had wished . But Miss Clarissa had seen her distorted face , with its drooping eyelid and twisted mouth , in a mirror , and she had ordered the glass removed from her dresser and the curtains drawn . In the semidarkness of her chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in , nor could the doctor induce her to come out . The great beautiful house that seemed made for entertaining was therefore without a mistress , for all practical purposes , and it was little wonder that Jane dreamt of returning . Then her third baby was born a healthy boy with the big frame and blue-gray eyes of the Howards , and Matthew named him James . When she knew he was boasting everywhere of the fine frontiersman this son would make , her dreaming changed to a desperate casting about for some plan . But the more she thought the more hopeless the situation seemed . As long as Matthew 's children were those who could not hope to lead in the Valley , there was a chance he might arrange to spend a part of the year in the Tidewater , but now  --  with a son named for the James Howard who could lift a hundred pounds of tobacco as high as his shoulder with an easy swing  --  now what chance was there to draw him from this western country he so in sanely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom had ridden over from Shadwell during his spring vacation , fresh from planting an avenue of trees in honor of his twenty-first birthday , eager to see Matthew and Jane , Albemarle Hall and the children , but with something else as well on his mind . " Mr. Christian is dead , Matt , " he said . Something in his tone made Jane lay down her embroidery " Mr. Christian ? " she asked . " Israel Christian , for years a burgess from Augusta County , Jane . I think Matt ought to stand for his place . There 's no man in the Valley better fitted to lead . " Matthew raised his head as if listening to some inner sound . What was it his father had said  --  set my heart for you to be a leader , like Colonel Jefferson  --  and now " Colonel Jefferson was a burgess , " he said aloud , and Tom stn iled . " Does that mean you 'll stand , Matt ? " Matthew grinned . " It means the fish is nibbling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors , anyway . " Jane felt as if imprisoning gates were swinging wide . " Oh , Matt ! " she cried . " I 'm glad . " He shook his head at her radiant face . " Even if I stand , there 's the matter of winning . " " I know you 'll win , " she said . CHAPTER 6In Which Matthew Goes to the House of Burgesses at Williamsburgand Plunges into a FightT HE eyes of the two men met , and the intensity of Fleetwood 's gaze set Matthew on his guard . " We take the vote on it tomorrow , " he said noncommittally . Fleetwood leaned back in his chair , shifting his gaze to thebox-bordered paths of the Elm Hill garden beyond his office window . " Being just come to the House of Burgesses you can hardlyI12 THE TREE OF LIBERTY DIVERGENT ROOTS 113have formed your opinion , Howard , but the bill is important to us here . London merchants will no longer take Virginia paper money even at the rate of five pounds for a debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorize it , can retire the paper and still leave a hundred and forty thousand pounds to set up the Loan Office . " " The Loan Office , backed by the tobacco tax , " Matthew spoke slowly , " to assist great planters in distress . " " Certainly . " Fleetwood 's tone of patient explanation took on a faint tinge of scorn . " It would be a disaster indeed for the entire colony if the landholding families were pushed to the wall . This loan with its two provisions will assure prosperity . " He smiled his charmingsmile . " Surely you see that and will support it . " " I see its value to you , sir . But the Loan Office paper is to be retired by the tax on tobacco . The quit-rents are already swallowed by the governor 's salary and expenses . And I see that my heavilytaxedneighbors are likely to wait many a w eary year for roads and bridges sorely needed now . What will we get of this prosperity you promise ? " " You 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The original debt was incurred to fight the Indian War . " " And was that not your war as well as ours ? And as to cost -- you gave your money . I lost my father . You can hardly expect me to think that balance dips in your favor . " Fleetwood flung out his hand in a sudden gesture of apology . " Forgive my cursed temper , Matthew . You have indeed paid in blood . But what would you gain by our ruin ? I had hoped I need not tell you this , but if all I owe were suddenly demanded of me , much of Elm Hill would have to go under the hammer . Most of my friends are in the same plight . Yet all we need is time to recover from the war , and the Loan Office would give us this time . This is far more urgent than a few roads and bridges . We must have your vote . " Matthew rose to his feet . Fleetwood 's calm assumption of superior importance never failed to anger hint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I can not see it as you do . The tobacco tax at present is a sheer robbery of the upland folk . I can not have a part in taking money needed for clothing and shoes to line the pockets of men who have thousands of acres of land and yet run into debt . " " By God , sir  --  " Fleetwood 's face was crimson , but Matthew interrupted him quickly . " I shall speak to Jane at once and we will leave as soon as she can get the children ready . Naturally , now you can scarcely wish to include me in your hospitality . " Fleetwood controlled his anger with an effort . " Nonsense , man ! My sister is my sister , and this is her home , however stubborn her husband may be . We shall doubtless win our bill without your vote . I should not have ea pected you to under-stand . " Matthew 's face flushed at the thinly veiled contempt . With a stiff bow he repeated he would leave Elm Hill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office to find Jane . The sound of children 's voices guided him to the east steps where she sat sewing in the afternoon shadow , while the three youngsters rode up and down the terrace in a wheelbarrow pushed by a grinning negro boy . At Matthew 's coming , a curtain at Miss Clarissa 's windowwhich had been slightly apart fell straight and closed . The wheelbarrow came to a halt . Little Peyton rolled from his perch and hobbled to meet his father with his queer uneven run ; but Matthew ignored him , stooping to ruffle the baby 's golden curls and laughing to feel the child push his hand away . " I 'm sorry to break into this pretty scene , Jane , " he said , " but we 'll have to pack up and move to town . I 've had a row with Fleet-wood . " Jane merely bit off her thread and reached for a spool . " I 'm right surprised it has n't come before , " she said , and even when Matthew explained she refused to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun it is to belong to the Peytons , " she told him with a laugh . " You 've been tied up to the peaceable member of the family , and , poor dear , you 've judged the rest by her .

But I also believe you gave him as good as he sent . " Matthew grinned guiltily and she went on . " Well , call it quits then . When he calms down he 'll recognize you ca n't vote to please him , and if he does n't I 'll tell him how hopeless I 've found it to get you to put your wife ahead of your precious neighbors . " " Jane , I  --  " " I know . " Gaily she caught him up . " You worship my very shadow , but  --  you go your own way . And I suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you much if you did n't . Still , you sha n't tear me from Elm Hill until the end of the session . I 'm too happy to be back . " " But Fleetwood  --  " " Fleetwood will likely get his Loan Bill in spite of your vote against it and then he 'll forget all about the fuss . " 11 4 ' I ' i i r . TREE or LIBERTYMatthew hesitated and she leaned over to pat his hand lightly . " I 'll talk to Fleetwood , Matt . Just you leave him to me. " he was thinking it would be unkind to shorten her visit to her childhood Inille . After all , he could bear Fleetwood 's insulting superiority for a month or two if he must , and if the staying on meant so nnicli to her . But after that talk with Fleetwood the could not dismiss the matter of the Loan Office Bill as lightly as she did . It was something to watch . Front his seat at the end of one of the members ' benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward he could see almost anyone who spoke . Elbow on knee and chin in hand he followed the debate and found its outcome incredibly shocking . It was not as if the cause of the upper counties had not been ably presented . A tall , stoop-shouldered , thin-faced new member from Hanover , Patrick Henry by name , had exposed the injustice of the scheme and in flamingwords branded it for what it was , a barefaced robbery of the poor by those who were already rich . Yet every burgess from the thirty-five Tidewater counties voted callously for it . Not one seemed even to hesitate . Matthew watched them with a slowly rising anger . Fleetwood Peyton was not alone . None of these powdered silken dandies cared anything for the troubles of the mountain people . Their faces haunted his sleeping and waking hours at night for weeks . Even though the Loan Office Bill was defeated at last by gentlemenfrom the Tidewater who sat on the governor 's Council , he did not change his judgment of them . They must have figured in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride . But if a man counted on their pride it might fail at the last moment . Matthew found that out when he reported to the family at Elm Hill that Parliament actually had passed the threatened bill levying a stamp tax on colonial legal paper . He had been in Tom Jefferson 's rooms when he heard the news and everyone there had been wild with indignation . It was interfering with internal revenue , a matter every Englishman kept in his own hands . Remonstrances against it had been sent to England from every single one of the colonies along the American mainland and in the West Indies . They were not represented in Parliament ; should Parliament dip its hand in their pockets ? Taxation without representation was tyranny . But Parliamenthad disregarded the protests and flouted the arguments . Any proud man would resent it . Any proud man would agree with the resolutions introduced by Patrick Henry before the House . That the Peytons , the personification of pride , could think otherwise had not entered Matthew 's head when he brought up the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that the law does n't take effectDIVERGENT ROOTS I15antil November . It gives us time to decide what we can do against it . " To his amazement Fleetwood spoke impatiently . " Do ' ! There 's nothing left to do but submit . The damn bill has passed . Thank God the amount of the tax is small . " " Surely the amount has nothing to do with it . " Matthew was vehement . " We ought not to pay a farthing levied by a legislature where we do n't sit . We ought to get together from Massachusetts Bay to Kingston in Jamaica and not let one stamp be sold ! " " Oh , come now , Howard ! " exclaimed Roger . " There 's reason in all things . Remonstrate again if you will . There 's still time before November , but to concert rebellion over a half-penny stamp  --  it 's ridiculous ! " " It certainly is ! " said Jane . " Tyranny in the matter of a halfpenny is still tyranny , and can be used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers with his gesture of dismissal . " Let us hope less hot-headed counsels will prevail , " he said . " ' T is a great pity the burgesses are in session at all . " Matthew could not understand then . A man from the Valley might argue that a tax on legal paper was a small matter , since a warehouse receipt for tobacco was the only official document he was likely to handle in a year , but such a levy would certainly work real hardship on Tidewater folk . It was against their interest , and surely their pride must be involved . They resented the tax with picturesque profanity , and yet since the bill was a law they felt nothing should be done . Not the Peytons alone . The feeling seemed general among Tidewater people . When Fleetwood and Roger rode with Matthew to Williamsburg the next morning to hear the final debate in the House they found a crowd gathered on the steps and under the arches supporting the center of the Capitol , an overflow from the throng in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they forced their way through , now one and now another hailed the Peytons . There were merchants from the town and planters from the James and the York , and one and all they deplored Mr. Henry 's resolutions of protest .

He hopes to make us forget his leather breeches and homespun stockings . " " He 's to give us a taste of his oratory , I hear , " said Roger . " Having unhorsed the parsons , he 's ready to take on the rest of the colony . " " Colony , man ! " remarked Fleetwood . " ' T is king , Lords and Commons he 's after now . Poor fool ! " i 16 THE TREE OF LIBERTYBy the door , Tom Jefferson caught Matthew 's shoulder . His hazel eyes were blazing and his face showed white with excitement under his freckles . " The benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously . " There are not many members left in town . But there 's a quorum , never fear . " " He will speak ? " " Never fear for that , either !

It 's queer what opposition there is . Would n't you think anyone  --  " Matthew 's voice trailed off . Torn nodded his head thoughtfully . " I know . All the learning and experience and wealth is against him . Yet I believe he is right , Matt . I just hope he can prove it . " But when Mr. Henry got to his feet he was at first a disappointment , even to Matthew leaning forward from his seat on the members ' bench , even to Tom Jefferson craning his neck over the crowd in the doorway . Hesitant in speech , awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pitiful finery of his dress proclaimed him , the member from the country out of place among scholars and men of the world . Dick Corbin and Roger Peyton exchangedcontemptuous smiles . When he was fairly launched on his thought , however , self-consciousness fell front him , the deep-set eyes blazed in his gaunt face , his voice grew deep , sonorous , his utterance rapid , a torrent of burning words . The faces of his friends reflected the force of his logic . The contempt of his adversaries changed to anxiety . Men drew together and apart . They breathed in opposing cadences . The air was electric . Taxation without representation , no matter how mild the impost , was tyranny , he said , and tyranny must be opposed in its beginnings . . . . Submission in this matter would be fatal to colonial liberty . . . . Since the Stamp Act had been passed in spite of remonstrance , the only hope now lay in a determined opposition to its execution . . . . Before a united people even tyrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First his Cromwell , and George the Third  --  " Wild cries broke out from the benches and the crowd at the door . " Shame ! For shame !

" The echo of his words shuddered from wall to wall as if a warning so portentous were loath to die into stillness . After a long silence voting began . Matthew leaned forward and gripped the back of the seat in front of him . Decisions were close . The great Tidewatergentlemen were voting solid , but here and there a smaller planter or a burgess from the Piedmont was swinging to Patrick Henry 's leadership . One , two , three , four resolutions passed ; but the fifth would be the test . It put the issue so no man could avoid it , declaring as it did that to place power to tax the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike at British as well as American freedom . Matthew gripped the bench until his fingers ached , keeping an agonized tally until the end of the roll call . Carried by one vote . He sat back , and it seemed to him as if the blood in his veins hitherto motionless began again to move . They had won . By God ! Patrick Henry had won ! The upland counties had forced their policy on the cautious Tidewater leaders . His neighbors could come into their own , at last . Outside in the Capitol yard the students from William and Mary were organizing a procession . They swung singing through the gate and out onto Duke of Gloucester Street . The words of their song came back to the crowd emerging from the Hall of the Burgesses . " With the Beasts of the Wood , We will ramble for Food , And lodge in wild Desarts and Caves , And live poor as JobOn the Skirts of the Globe , Before we 'll submit to be Slaves . " Tom Jefferson gripped Matthew 's arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " It 's a declaration of fundamental rights . " " It is , for a fact . " There was no doubt in Matthew 's mind that a great victory had been won and Fleetwood Peyton 's first remark strengthened that conviction . " ' T is a damn bad thing your precious friends have done , MatthewHoward , " he declared angrily . " By rousing the passions of the rabble you have prevented any quiet solution of this matter . There 'll be riot and reprisals before you are through , and if blood is shed the guilt should be placed where it belongs , sir  --  on the shoulders of this scoundrel from Hanover and those who supported him . " IIb ' THE TREE OF LIBERTY " Say , rather , " cried Matthew with equal heat , " if liberty is preserved in this struggle the mantle of glory should be laid where it belongs  --  on the shoulders of this man you call the scoundrel from Hanover . " Jane looked from one to the other and slowly her cheeks whitened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the spirit of violent revolt which Patrick Henry typified . It was the frontier again , elemental and dangerous , which she thought they had defeated by coming to Williamsburg . Yet here was Matthew applauding , swept away by it . What would become of her , what would become of the children , of little Peyton , if the frontier could win Matthew 's complete allegiance ? She had pitted herself against the frontier when she first saw it , she had foughtbutwhat earthly chance had she to win if even in the House of Burgesses Matthew found support for his objections to discipline . He wanted to throw away discipline . He could n't see that all that would be left would be ruin ! And she was married to him . The life that he chose she would have to live . Could she let him take a road that led straight to riot and ruin , just because her fight was against too many odds ? With a glance at Fleetwood she lifted her chin . She would fight for Matthew 's mind against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against everyone . Matthew was a leader and he must be a leader on the side of law and order . He just must n't ruin the new Howard family they were establishing together . She had already done something with him . Her new Howard family had come a long way since the clays of her barbarous infare . She drew confidence from the fact that they left Williamsburg when the session was over in a fine new coach of their own , and their progress was such as a gentleman 's family should make , by easy stages from plantation house to plantation house , with a stop of almost a week at Shadwell to take in the festivities of Dabney Carr 's wedding to Tom Jefferson 's sister Martha . Jane rejoiced in the dignity already won , but she intended to forge ahead until the new name was as proud as the name of Peyton or Randolph . If there was something unyielding and hard in Matthew , something that unfailingly took fire at the rantings of a man like Patrick Henry , there was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they swung in at their own drive with the young maples liftingtall straight plumes on either side , when they first saw the gracious house with the colonnaded wings in its summer setting of flowering gardens , green lawns and shadowy trees , she smiled at Matthew , and he not only returned the smile , he drew her close to his side , as if acknowledging a tie that made them one . She could not know that the beauty of the place , which to her was a link with ordered life was to him a reminder of the leadership to which the frontier was calling him . It was enough for her that he was proud . She could build on that , even here on the frontier . The atmosphere of his home should woo him from the lawless ways of his neighbors , and since he was at home more than he was abroad she would make headway even here . And she counted on a yearly visit to Williamsburg to strengthen the effect she might produce . In the House of Burgesses there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elm Hill there were Fleetwood and Roger , But it was three years before a call was issued again to the House of Burgesses , three long years during which Jane came to know how strangely different was Matthew 's pride from hers , while the children grew until the golden-haired baby James was a fine boy of four with broad shoulders and flat back and the Howard eyes , and all three were beyond the need of her continual supervision . She had them for their lessons each morning in the upper hall that was the schoolroom , but while they studied or wrote , she had time to think of Matthew . He was queer about the children . James he would have made a pet but when the child perversely shrank from him and apparently could not be won to friendliness by any effort , he , in turn , drew away from all three . Jane found it hard to forgive him for the way he treated young Peyton , who always greeted him with a joyous shout . He acted as if he could scarcely bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot blinded him to the beauty of face and grace of gesture that was also a Peyton heritage . And little Mary , engaging though she was with the dark curls that contrasted so prettily with her wide gray eyes , being only a girl , could not offset his disappointment in his sons . He avoided the children as much as he could . Jane faced that fact early in the three years . She could not count on the children to help draw him from his frontier neighbors . And the influence of the ordered peace in the house , which she spent such effort to maintain , was continually being threatened by the ripples from the wild excitement of the seaport towns against the Stamp Act . She would have avoided discussion of the issue if she could . Living with Fleetwood had certainly taught her it was right stupid to harden a gentleman by open opposition . The thing to do was quietly to undermine his opinion . But those objectors to the Stamp Tax had got together in a congress from ever so many of the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it would ; and when Matthew called these stupid acts the protestsof bold men she just could n't keep still . Ito TILE TREE OF LIBERTY " There 's nothing very bold in a mob setting on one official and smashing up his office , that I can see , Matthew . It 's violence , and it ought to be stopped . " " Ca n't you see that quartering troops on an unarmed people is tyranny ? " " If people are insubordinate they must expect to be punished . " " Punished ! " he repeated , staring at her as if she saw black as white . She lifted her chin . " Anyhow , we 're not mixed up in it , thanks to Governor Fauquier . If you crazy burgesses were allowed to meet there 'd be troops in Virginia , I expect , as well as in New York . The governor is right wise not to let you make a bad matter worse ! " She had merely stated the one bit of comfort she found in the governor 's action which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew was infuriated into weeks of silence by what he felt was an echo of Fleetwood 's contemptuous superiority . Word came to Albemarle Hall that Thomas Jefferson had returned to Shadwell , with his legal training completed , to begin the practice of law and that he had a case to argue in Augusta County . Jane hoped for a great deal when Matthew set out for the Courthouse to capture the young lawyer for a few days ' visit . Mr. Jeffersor was newly come from Williamsburg , he was a close personal friend of the governor . He surely could make Matthew see reason . But when all three were seated before the crackling fire in the hall , and when the talk had passed from gossip of the courtships , the lover 's quarrelsand the marriages of their Williamsburg friends to the discussionof politics , Jane sat frozen and still . All the eloquence and logic Mr. Jefferson had , all the persuasiveness of his tongue and the charm of his manner he threw into defending the necessity for resistance to the pretensions of Parliament . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on him to hold Matthew back . " I ca n't understand him , " she declared as she put out the candles that night and drew the bedcurtains against the drafts . " He 's certainly had a chance to know better . Going every few days to the palace ! His Excellency was beginning to make an intimate of him that winter before we were married , Matthew . ' Would n't you think he would have learned something in seven years ? And his mother is a Randolph ! " Matthew 's only answer was a sleepy grunt , and Jane , climbing up the steps , lowered herself carefully into her own nest in the feather bed . For a long time she lay awake in the darkness listening to the moan of the wind in the chimney and the soft cracking ofDIVERGENT ROOTS 12Jthe wainscot as the room grew cold and thinking of the difficulties of her married life . They had Albemarle Hall as a common enterprise , she and Matthew , but everything else , the children , this friendship with Mr. Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push them apart . With a little sigh she moved over in the bed and laid her cheek against her husband 's back . He moved presently and drew her to him , but even in his arms the barrier was there . In the spring of ' 68 Governor Fauquier died and Mr. Blair , the president of the Council who was acting head until the new governor could come from England , called the burgesses to Williamsburg . The meeting was set for late in the year , no time for a pleasure jaunt to the Tidewater , but Jane was glad to see Matthew go , even though he went alone . Mr. Blair was one of the finest of the Tidewatergentlemen and impressive with the wisdom of his great age , and his venerable white hair . If any people at all could bring Matthewand his friends to see reason , Jane trusted Mr. Blair and the great planters on his Council to do it . Yet when Matthew came home he reported that the main business which the president of the Councillaid before the burgesses had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . " Mr. Blair suggested that ? " " He did for a fact , lass "  --  Matthew 's eyes were twinkling  --  " and when it was done into good stiff language the Council set their approval on it without a dissenting vote . Now what have you to say ? " " It 's plain enough , " she answered tartly , " that Williamsburg has gone downright crazy . " That the madness was temporary she was perfectly sure , even before she heard the new governor was Lord Botetourt . A nobleman ! The installation of a nobleman would be a brilliant affair . There would be much ceremonial and pageantry , and in the thrill and excitement of the welcome , differences would just naturally be forgotten or be easy to patch up . She could hardly wait for the spring session . To dance again , beautiful , decorous dances instead of wild reels and jigs , to see the crowding coaches and the fine horses on Duke of Gloucester Street and around the palace green , to go to the races and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vices of their children , it would be heaven , that 's what it would be . But when the time came to leave , all three youngsters were down with a convulsive cough . Sukey 's Tom and Dicey 's Rachel had it too , so there was no one free to look after them all , even if poor little Peyton had not had it so very hard . She was dreadfullyI22 THE TREE OF LIBERTY DIVERGENT ROOTS I23disappointed not to go with Matthew , and uneasy too ; for he wa , stopping at Shadwell to pick up Thomas Jefferson , the newlyelectedburgess from Albemarle County , and he planned to put up at the Bull 's Head with his friend instead of going out to Elm Hill . When Jane had asked him why not the Raleigh he had answered that the Bull 's Head was quieter and they liked the sort of folk who went there . Yet strangely enough it was not the abstract ideas of Mr. Jefferson , or the fervid talk of other guests at the Bull 's Head , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subversive enough , which pushed Matthew to the final steps of revolt . It was the train of events set in motion by Colonel Washington , who was also a member of the House , a train that took two years to get fully in motion . The new governor dissolved the Assembly almost immediately for daring to criticize His Majesty 's government , but the burgesses , being in no mood to disband , met next day in the Apollo Room at the Raleigh . The elected delegates from the counties of Virginia could hardly be expected to go tamely home without even voicing a protest . With grim , businesslike speed they put the Speaker , Peyton Randolph , in the chair of their voluntary convention and when ColonelWashington presented a draft of an association to be formed against the use of British goods until taxation could be put on a just basis they all signed it and ordered their clerk to recommend membership to all the other colonies . Torn Jefferson thought they had found a club that would bring Parliament to terms . " The British merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the meeting 's close the members crowded into the narrow passage on the way out , jostling each other in the noisy relief of a crisis just passed , and Matthew , separated from Torn , found himselfshoulder to shoulder with Colonel Washington . The older man seized a moment to ask him a question . " If I remember aright , Mr. IIoward , you said once that your father and uncle fought with me in the first two campaigns against the French . " Matthew stopped astonished , and Mr. Washington drew a small worn notebook from an inner pocket aid leafed it through methodically . " Ah , here it is , I presume . James Howard ? " Matthew nodded and he made a checkmark in his book , " And your uncle was  --  ? " " Reuben Wetherall . " Matthew 's surprise was now in his voiceMr- Washington turned over a page , made another check and returned the notebook to his pocket . " As soon as this matter of the western boundary is determined I intend to make a survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in explanation . " The payment is long overdue . " They had separated then , and Matthew went back to Jane at Albemarle Hall , but thoughts quiet for nearly fourteen years were awake and stirring . The land in Ohio which his father had hoped to win ! Strange if it should be granted now , when James Howard was dead , and his son established in the Shenandoah . Matthew had no need for primeval acres . But what of his mother and Sarah and Ellen ? His thoughts prowled uneasily about the barrier he had built years ago across the path of childhood memory , and through months of varied occupations , while he vainly tried to beat them back , they persisted in showing him Susan Howard working at her loom against the summer green of his growing fields , or in the light of a winter fire , little Ellen peering around the corner of the settle at Uncle Reuben with fear in her wide , dark eyes . He heard nothing further from Colonel Washington on the matter for a year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Assembly , but he could not put these ghosts from his childhood out of his mind . Anything , the sight of Colonel Washington on a Williamsburg street , a debate in the House of Burgesses over the western boundary , gossip from the Valley traders that an English company was being formed to sell land in Ohio , anything would bring them back to haunt him . And the question he had been trying for eighteen months to avoid was squarely put at last in a crumpled note delivered at AlbemarleHall two days after a cold Christmas . It was brought by a grizzled trapper who had traveled with Colonel Washington from Fort Pitt to Mr. Hite 's in Winchester , and was read by Matthew with a divided mind . Mr. Washington reported that all the soldier grants had been located by notched and initialed trees that no one could question , and well in advance of any survey that the Walpole Company in England might contemplate . " Your father and uncle have each been assigned a private 's share of four thousand acres of fine bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of these grants with the Governor in Williamsburg , will you do me the favor to forward to Mount Vernon the names of the heirs to Mr. Wetherall 's land , should there be any , other than yourself ? " I24 THE TREE OF LIBERTYAfter a night of twisting and turning during which Jane slept little more than he , Matthew announced a decision at breakfast . " Against spring comes , " he said , the upland turn of his phrase betraying his emotion to Jane , " I must go to Carolina . " " Carolina ? " she repeated . The name had some painful echo which she could not quite place . " I have it in mind to find my mother and my sisters . " " Oh , yes , " she said . She had it now , the memory of the night at Mount Pleasant , on their wedding journey , when he had talked with evident effort of his family . She sent the children from the room that they might speak freely and , coming around the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it help , Matthew , to tell me what you have held back all these years ? " He considered this , but shook his head at last . " Hit would only sadden you . Hit was a great wrong I did them , Jane , and I have a right to undo it now . " " Then of course , honey , " she agreed swiftly , " you must go , as soon as spring comes . " But the spring brought the high water that was known to a whole generation of Virginians as " the flood of ' 71 . " It cut into fields and delayed the spring work ; it burst the dam above the Secretary 's Ford at Shadwell and carried away Colonel Peter Jefferson'smill . The burgesses were unable to get to Williamsburg for the spring session before July , and it was the end of summer when Matthew could start for Carolina . He wore his hunting shirt and rode on Ranger . The old horse was somewhat slow , but he could still be counted on even for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it in mind they 'll welcome the sight of a horse they know , " he told Jane as he mounted . She stroked Ranger 's muzzle , velvety still if it was turning gray . " Bring them back with you , Matt , if you find them in trouble . " " I aim to do that , " he said . He rode south from Staunton , as Augusta Courthouse was beginning to be called , along the Great Road through valleys openingone from another , now narrow and hilly , now wide and rolling , and as he rode he searched the country with questioning eyes . Good land , good houses everywhere . He crossed the upper waters of the James to find the Valley swinging to the west . At Big Lick on the Roanoke he left the Great Road and had the ferryman set him across the river on the trace to Carolina . Beyond a gap in the mounDIVERGENTROOTS 125:gins to the southward he came on Fort Blackwater , standing as Shadwell stood , guarding a gate from his mountain world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace must have been long , he thought , as he noticed the gates to the grass-grown enclosure sagging on rusty hinges . The lizards sunning themselves on the stones were the only garrison . The houses were smaller now , though only a few were oneroomcabins and even these had wide fields and young orchards about them . The land of loopholes had become the land of the open window and door , even as it was in the Shenandoah . Perhaps McIntoshand those others had done as well as he . From Mr. Hickey at Fort Trial he learned that most of the northern people had settled in the Yadkin country . " At Boone 's place or the Old Town down there you 'll likely get news of your kin . " But neither at Boone 's , nor at first in the Old Town , could he learn anything , although in the ordinary at the latter place he became convinced the men he questioned were lying . They were sitting , three of them with a half-grown boy , at a table by the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had asked for Dave McIntosh as he always did , but now , suspecting that knowledge was being held back , he forced himself to try the effect of that other name . " McTavish ! " cried the boy . " Do you mean the schoolmaster over on Allemance Cree  --  " The shoulders of one of the men shifted as if a kick had been launched under the table , and the boy stopped abruptly . " The man I mean is a schoolmaster , " said Matthew . " Do you know him , son ? " " No , suh . " The boy 's eyes were on the man whose shoulders had moved . " Not me . " Matthew dragged forward a stool and sat down . From the pouch at his belt he drew his pipe and a twist of tobacco . This he offered to each of the men who silently cut their chews . His own piece he ground in his palm with his thumb and packed into the bowl of his pipe . He lit it and got it drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What-way you are afeared of me passes wonder . Hit 's not in reason I should bring them harm , and I Mis ' McTavish 's son . " He waited , but still the four regarded him suspiciously . " Hit 's well-nigh twelve years since she set eyes on me . Twelve years . I have it in mind she 'll not take this a kindness , iffen you keep me from her now . " J26 THE TREE OF LIBER7 YHe waited again , puffing his pipe . The oldest of the men cleared his throat and spat . " Yo ' name is McTavish ? " " No , " said Matthew , " my name 's Howard , but I 'm full brother to the wife of Dave McIntosh and the lass Ellen . " " Pappy a mountain-man " " Mountain to the bone-marrow and I am too . Now will you tell me where is McTavish ? " The man shook his head . " Cai n't tell yo ' where he is . I cai n't , for a fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's daid . " " Dead ! " " Shot daid , stranger , by the governor 's soldiers . Unarmed he was , and only tryin ' to talk for " And mammy ? " He hardly dared put the question . " Yo ' mammy got clear away . Dave , he lit out with young Hunter . Seems like Ellen , she 's married with young Hunter ; and when the trouble was over , yo ' mammy and the gals they followed after . There was a power of the neighbors went together . To Tennessee , seems like , to join Daniel Boone . " " Tennessee , " Matthew repeated dully , for he realized they were beyond his help . " I was bringin ' them word of western land I had for them . " " They 'll not lack for land , " the man assured him . " Where Daniel Boone is there 's a power o ' land . " Bit by bit he had their story of " the trouble " and it might have been a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , it seemed , and unbearable taxes , unredressed grievances , unansweredremonstrances and courts that dealt out injustice . " Last fall-o ' - the- year we-all set up for to regulate our own selves , when the governor he had no mind to regulate for us . The schoolmaster he helped and there was others hit 's not wisdom to - call by name . Regulators , that 's the name we-all took . And we regulatedall the country from this to Hillsborough and a good scope more . Telled the governor he could regulate Tidewater , but we-all would regulate up yere . But seems like Governor Tryon he had to have hit all , even iffen he do n't keer to regulate . " He had armed the militia and marched into the hills with the coming of spring . There was a pitiful battle on Allemance Creek , where the hill people fought like wildcats , until only a handful were left . Six prisoners the governor hanged . " And that ended it , " Matthew told Jane bitterly , when he got back . " He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shot or hanged those he could get his hands on and drove the rest to TenDIVERGENTROOTS 127nessee . Then he went back where he came from and thought a good job done . There 's government for you ! " " But surely , Matthew , you would expect him to put down an open revolt ! " " He never tried to find out about it , I tell you ! Those men were not criminals . They wanted to be regulated ' and when he would n't attend to it they were ready to do it themselves . That was all , and he shot them down , out of hand ! " " But they were rebels ! And government  --  " " I tell you government is a thing to be fought with all the strength a man has . It makes bloodthirsty brutes of those who rule , and those who submit it makes into curs . Whipped curs ! You should have seen those men at the ordinary , Jane . Scared to death , they were , even of me ! " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you myself . " But Matthew did not laugh , and as time went on and every circumstance brought out the new bitterness of his feeling against the established rule , Jane lost her inclination to laugh as well . Duringthe weeks of his absence she had missed him with a strange longing ache that she had not known even that time he had to leave her before Peyton was born . Of course , he was in trouble . Somethingtoo sad to tell her forced this journey . Perhaps that was why she was unable to keep her thoughts from him . Anyway , she was absent-minded and even cross with the children and impatient with Dicey . Restless and uneasy , she wanted nothing so much as to be alone , and yet when she was alone in bed at night she found herself burying her head in his pillow and crying like any lovesick girl , she a grown woman of twenty-seven ! And here he was back with the barrier between them higher than ever and every fresh rumor of riot and harsh measures in Boston and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She felt like a swimmer breasting wave after wave . As each was surmounted another came on ; and what the opposition of her brothers had begun , the oppositionof these crowding events was completing . She was now madly in love with this incomprehensible man she had married . She loved the waves of his red-gold hair , the lean line of his cheeks , the cleft in his chin , even the smoldering anger of his gray eyes  --  only she did wish the right things would rouse his wrath . It was queer how everything seemed to combine to increase the intensity of her feeling , even things that started out by being a distraction like Mr. Jefferson 's marriage . When she heard at the turn of the year that he had brought the young widowed daughter of John Wayles of Forest to the new house he was beginning to build on the top of his mountain , such a wave of pity for the bride128 THE TREE OF LIBERTYswept her that for a time it certainly filled her thoughts . Matthew said the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet they could not go to Shadwell , since the house there had burned to the ground and Mrs. Jefferson with the four children still at home was living crowded under the roof of the overseer . Jane remembered little Martha Wayles as a beautiful , fragile child with auburn curls and lovely big eyes , sitting with her mammy on the stairs at Forest to watch the older girls dance ; and the thought of that poor little thing arriving on that mountain in midwinter was dreadful . No matter how much in love she was , her first view of the place that Mr. Jefferson in his ambitious way called Monticello must have been a shock . Jane remembered the disappointment of her own introduction to Albemarle Hall , in spite of the sunshine and the glory of autumn coloring . She cast about for something she could do to reassure the child . She wrote a note of welcome and encouragement for Matthew to leave as he went by on his way to a session of the House that was called in February , and she gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Charlottesville to meet him on his way home , that they might visit the bride and groom together , Enough of the wet should be out of the roads by the end of April to make it possible to get over Woods ' Gap . She told herself that it was only her desire to be helpful to this other Tidewater girl , thrown into a situation so similar to her own , which led her to spend so many hours reliving her first days at Albemarle Hall ; but that occupation had its effect on her . By the time she saw Matthew waiting for her on the steps of the courthouse tavern in Charlottesville , as the coach jolted and rumbled around the square to the door , she felt like a bride herself . The children had been left behind in Dicey 's care , she was free of responsibility for the first time in nearly twelve years , and the light in Matthew 's eyes made her heart turn over queerly . To add to the effect of a return to the days of their courting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was looking over his shoulder . It was an older Mr. Carr , a little heavier perhaps , as became the father of five children , but still handsome and gay . Jane waved at him delightedly . It was a real effort to recall her mind to the young girl she had come to comfort and reassure . But before the first sun had set Jane learned that it was not the new mistress of Monticello plantation who was most in need of reassurance . Matthew had taken rooms in the courthouse tavern for the nights , but as they were to spend their days on the mountain they went on up there at once . Mr. Jefferson 's place had not yet advanced beyond the crude beginnings that Jane had imagined . DIVERGENT ROOTS 129Along the edge of a space that was all too obviously leveled off , a line of service buildings and quarters had been strangely dug out of the side hill and sunk so low that their roofs , flattened off , formed a walk on the edge of the new-made lawn , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncompromising . In winter it certainly must have been appalling . All this was what she had expected . It was young Mrs. Jefferson who was the surprise . She was tall and graceful , and if her beauty still had the fragile quality Jane remembered in the child , it was crowned with happiness and most attractive pride in what her husband was doing . She was the first to see them driving up for she was out on the roof walk , but presently Mr. Jefferson came scrambling up a ladder from a great , ragged foundation hole where he had some people at work . He greeted Jane hilariously and hailed the men with shouts of " Wildcats ! " and odd gestures ceremoniously performed . He was in the highest of spirits and his young wife was not a bit behind him . When he dragged the men off to inspect his digging she turned to Jane with a smile . " He 'll make them go down that ladder and poke into everything , but if you come with me to the house , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain  --  like pictures . " The plans certainly were beautiful as pictures , not rough sketches scrawled by candlelight , and there was a master builder who had come from England to direct the work on them , but as Jane watched the girl beside her , flushed with excitement over this and that detail , she was warmed by the memory of her first winter in the Shenandoah when she and Matthew had planned Albemarle Hall . There was no need to pity Martha Wayles Jefferson ; she was probably going through the happiest days of her life . Jane gave a light , involuntary sigh , and her hostess caught up her sewing that lay on the bed . " You 're tired , Mrs. Howard . How thoughtless I 've been ! You must lie down right now . " But Jane shook her head " I 'm not tired , indeed , ma'am . I was just thinking , and right rude it was of me , too . What were you doing when we came up ? Sewing ? " " Yes , Mrs. Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folds she held and her color heightened slightly . Jane slipped her arm about her waist . " You 'd better lie down yourself , honey , " she said . Martha Jefferson 's laugh was a low , thrilling sound . " I never in my life felt less like lying down . It 's such a lovely day , would you like to sit outside ? The roof walk makes a right fine130 THE TREE OF LIBERTYseat , and the trees have been cut back so we get the view uoth ways . " After they had taken their places she nodded at the bald expanse before them . " His office will be over there . " The tender intonation indicated her meaning . " He 'll have a one-room brick house just like this , with the coachhouse and stables dug into the hill under it to edge the lawn with a walk on that side , too . Wo n't it be lovely when it 's done ? No ugly barns or untidy quarters in sight from the house . Just a garden and this breath-taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile of her own . It was delightfulto sit silent on this high place , with the spring wind ruffling her hair and the spring sun warm on her back . The voices of the men sounded louder and died away as they climbed out of the foundationand went off over the round of the hill . Jane 's eyes followed them and Martha offered an explanation . " He 's taking them down to see the top he 's made for the chaise , I expect . He 's right proud of it , and it is mighty useful . It folds back when you do n't want it , but in rain or snow you can pull it up and brace it and the seat is covered . All the neighbors about here are copying it . " " I expect he had to fix up something to keep the weather out of his traveling-carriage before he got you up here from the Tidewater . He must have lived on the road .

They were lovely in their young green tinged with rose and gold , with the slantingwhite of dogwood here and there , and here and there the purple veil of a Judas tree . They were beautiful and familiar now , but she wondered if she was not still afraid of them . After the men came back she was sure of it . They were talking earnestly about something as they came up the hill and they continued their subject when they dropped down beside the two women . Mr. Jefferson stretched out full length along the walk and rested his head in his wife 's lap . " Matt tells me , Martha , " he informed her , " the feeling is spreading that the interests of England and of the English merchantsare contrary to ours ; and that in this taxation business Massachusettsfights our battle . " Matthew produced a bit of evidence before taking a place beside Jane . " There were those who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROOTS I31Mr . Carr remained standing in front of them , his cloak over his arm , his hands clasped behind him . " There ought to be some way to act together , " he declared , " even though England does control the colonial governments . There ought to be something  --  " " If folk to southward knew what we know , " asserted Matthew vehemently , " likely their blood would be as hot as ours . " Jane heard him with cold horror . What was he thinking ? What were they all thinking ? She turned for support to the girl beside her , but Martha Jefferson 's eyes were shining with an idea . " Dearest ! " she cried . " There 's the Committee of Correspond-ence . " " The Committee of Correspondence ? " All three men merely echoed her words . " Yes , you know  --  Mr. Nicholas , Mr. Wythe and the rest who write to our agent in England . Could n't they write to the other colonies ? They 're always in session , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together without being called by anyone . " There was a moment 's pause while Jane desperately tried not to believe that they meant what they seemed to mean . Mr. Jefferson spoke first . " There are too many councilors on that committee . Councilors are timid , God knows why . " Mr. Carr folded his cloak and sat down on it cross-legged with a purposeful motion . " It could be reorganized , " he said . " By the House of Burgesses , " added Matthew . " None but strong men who believe in acting . " " Oh ! Oh ! " cried Jane , " you ca n't mean deliberately to stir up revolt ! " But the others were too excited to hear her . Martha Jefferson was nodding her bright head at Mr. Carr . " You 'll just have to stand for the House of Burgesses now , Dabney , so they can put you on the Committee . " They went on for some time , laughing and yet in earnest for all their laughter , but Jane was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bypath of its own . How the daughter of John Wayles of Forest could countenance anything so wild and wrong as this she could not see . To stir revolt was treason and for treason men were hanged . Matthew might be hanged . Jane 's hands flew to her throat . Matthew ! Her Matthew ! She looked up at his face as he leaned forwardbeside her , eager , excited , busily plaiting the rope for his own hanging. 132 THE TREE OF LIBERTY DIVERGENT ROOTS 133 " No ! " she said tensely , clenching her hands together . " No ' what , lass ? " asked Matthew , smiling down at her . The exclamation had no possible connection with what had just been said . She shook her head and did not answer . There was no use in saying anything now , here , with these friends whom she wanted to like , but whom she was beginning to distrust and fear . She must move carefully , but she must hold Matthew back . Mr. Jefferson was sitting up now on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his wife Jane could see its expression .

No , she was thinking , not even for so dear a gain . Matthew might never again look at her with that light in his eyes if she set herself against him . But even so  --  she could n't let him hang himself  --  she loved him too much . She lifted her chin and her eyes focused on the view . A cloud had passed over the sun and all the lovely colors were gone from the mountains . Dark shape behind dark shape they waited for some- thing , menacing and watchful ; and Jane gathered her inner forces together against them . They should n't have Matthew , even though he loved them  --  even though they claimed him kin . CHAPTER 7 In Which War Breaks Out and Jane Hopes to Postpone a Struggle D ABNEY CARR , dead !

" Her eyes were oddly intent , but he had no heart to figure out her meaning . She had been talking like this off and on for a year now , and it never made much sense . " Mingo says they 've buried him at Shadwell . Hit 's a vast pity Toni was n't home . He 'll likely have to move him now . " " Move him ! ! " Jane stood rooted with horrified indignation . " Why should Mr. Jefferson object to his being buried there ? After all , Dabney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband  --  " " Hit 's a pledge they made as boys , Jane . Whichever died first , the other was to bury on the mountain . " " What a queer thing ! But there 's no graveyard at Monticello , is there ? " " There 's a tree where we used to study . " " But Dabney 's wife  --  " 134 THE TREE OF LIBERTY " Tom will take her too , apter than not . Hit 's not likely Dabney left much , and there are six children now . Another baby was born this spring . " " Gracious goodness , Matthew ! Six children to look after beside those he may have himself ? " " IIit would n't be like Tom to let his sister Martha be dependent on the Carrs . There 's worlds of room in that house he 's built . " When Matthew reached Monticello he found it was even as he expected . Martha Carr was already installed with her little brood in one wing of the new house , and Tom was only waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a grave under the great oak where the three boys had studied and dreamed . The two who were left stood together there after the service was over and the others had gone . A breeze coming up from the valley below moved the leaves of their tree to a gentle rustling . Somewhere in the woods a bird called . Tom Jefferson stirred . " I think , " he said , " of all men living I loved him most . " Matthewextended his hand and Tom silently grasped it in both his own . " You 'll take up what he laid down , Matt ? You 'll not see his work go undone ? " " Naught shall go undone that I can do , but I ca n't fill the place of Dabney Carr . " " No one could do that . " " No , for a fact . " Matthew stayed on for nearly a week , but this matter of Dabney'swork was not brought up again until just before he left . Then Tom explained briefly : " No real appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets again ; but meanwhile someone must go on . I 'll write the other members of the Committee and when I hear from then I 'll send his papers over to Albemarle Hall . He had his assigned correspondents in certain colonies . You 'll find it plain enough . You pass on information you receive to them and send copies of everything to the other Committeemen . If any sort of crisis comes up we 'll get together before acting . " Matthew said nothing to Jane of this on his return . His work could not begin for several months in any case , and there was the chance that his name might not be acceptable to the other Committeemen . Since she had made it clear that she dreaded to have him involved , there was no point in distressing her until the thing was certain . When Dabney 's papers did cone from Monticello she happened to be away , gone with her medicine kit to the bedside of a sick neighbor . The children had a rtin of an eruptive fever , that went the rounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thatDIVERGENT ROOTS 135and the usual butchering and the flurry of Christmas entertaining , it was on in January before she noticed the unusual amount of correspondencethat was finding its way into Matthew 's office . A packet of mail left by a messenger when he was out directing a woodcuttingoperation caused her first questions . She was sitting waiting in the hall , holding the bundle with such tense fingers when he came in that evening that he knew at once an unpleasant argument was impending . The children were nowhere to be seen . She had sent them off , no doubt , so she could be free to say what she wished . Matthew sighed as he laid aside his snowy cloak and hat . " Are you a member of that Committee of Correspondence , Matthew ? " He took his time answering , partly because he wanted to think how best to put it , and also because he really was amused by the efforts of Sukey 's Tom to pull off his wet boots . " You 're too small yet for that job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chamber and bring the bootjack . " " Yes , suh , marster . " The child scampered off and Matthew turned to Jane . " I 'm not a member . I 'm just helping out until the House meets next spring . " " But you answer these things , I suppose ? And sign your name ? " " Why , yes . " He looked up from the sheaf of letters he had taken from the bundle . Her last question surprised him . Did n't everyone sign a letter ? Sukey 's Tom was back with the jack and Jane waited until he was off to the kitchen with the boots before she went on , and to Matthew 's amazement he saw she was trembling . " Matthew , do n't you know  --  ca n't you see all this you 're doing is treason ? " " Treason ? Why , lass , that 's absurd . " He reached out and would have taken her hands but she snatched them beyond his reach . " Can you prove that , Matthew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those letters about ? " " Well , I have n't read these yet , but if they 're like all the others I 've had , they bring me news of what is going on in Boston and New York that I pass along to friends to southward . " " In other words you 're stirring up revolt in the Carolinas and Georgia  --  trying to make them see that the fight in Massachusetts is their fight too , as Mr. Jefferson said . " " You are putting a meaning into Tom 's words they never had136 THE TREE OF LIBERTYfor him or for us , Jane . " His voice was stern . " We 're trying to make a united protest to prevent oppression . There is no thought of armed revolt . Pray God hit ne'er comes to that . " " But if it should come  --  oh , please , Matt , listen to me , and think of this  --  if it should come , your precious Committee will be to blame . " Matthew stared at her . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicate lifting brows ; the parted lips and heightened color . If he could only make her see " Your brother Fleetwood said something like that about PatrickHenry at the time of the Stamp Act resolutions . Riot and bloodshedhe. said would follow . But what ( lid follow , Jane , was the repeal of the Act . We owe that victory to Mr. Henry 's strong stand and to the united protest that was made by a congress of the Colonies . " " Oh , you 're not thinking of another congress of the colonies ! Matthew , you ca n't do that  --  you just must n't take any part in that  --  oh , ca n't you see ? If oppression in Massachusetts really were oppressionin Georgia and the Carolinas , why , Georgia and the Carolinascertainly would know it without you to tell them . There was no need for a Committee of Correspondence to work up the Stamp Act Congress . Everybody was hit by that tax . Everybody was furious and they all had to say so . But you 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What an English governor has done in New York and Boston an English governor can do in Virginia , Jane . Look at that man Tryon in Carolina  --  " " You 're always making out the English governors are dreadful men , Matthew ; but I 've known a number of them , known them well , and I tell you they 're right fine gentlemen . Governor Fauquier and Lord Botetourt both stood up for Virginia when she was in the right , and Lord Dunmore will too , if you just give him a chance . But you certainly ca n't go spreading letters from these lawless rioters in Boston around the country , and then expect any governor to help you . It 's treason , Matthew , treason against the king ! " The muscles in Matthew 's cheeks were twitching but he spoke quietly . " I have it in mind the trouble with you Tidewater folk is that you spend too much time with the English governor . Likely you do know him , but you know nothing of your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , united protest brought us relief before , the only relief we 've had ; and if nothing else will do and united protest is decided on again , I 'll work for it  --  on the Committeeor off . And if I can find any man in Virginia or Georgia whoDIVERGENT ROOTS 137does n't know that an army quartered on the people of New York is a threat to his peace , I 'll tell him about it if it 's the last  --  " A pounding on the hall door brought them both to a pause , and Matthew , with a complete change in his manner , leaped to his feet and crossed the room with tremendous strides . He flung the door open to admit a man in buckskins with snow on his shoulders . " Is yore name Howard ? There 's those in the Courthouse saidyou had horses an ' could carry word to the folk in the coves and hollows on this side , from North River to Buffalo Gap , that theInjuns are risin ' . " Matthew closed the door against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " But come in andwarm yourself . You need go no farther tonight . " The man in buckskins smiled . " Here 's kindness , for a fact . All is , Andy MacGarrough has abed warmin ' for me at the Courthouse , an ' hit 's best I should be well up the Valley by sunup . Iffen we look to get word to the Cumberlandcountry before they strike no time can be lost on the way . Tell the settlers to move in to the forts on the Shenandoah . Hit 's past mortal power to hold even so well-made a house as this againstwhat may be comin ' . " " You mean , " Jane spoke for the first time , " you think evenwe ought to move . " " Two trader-men have been killed on Ohio , ma'am ; and wardrums are soundin ' up an ' down the river . Hit 's no common raid the varmints are plannin ' , and they movin ' about with the snow stilldeep . " Jane got up briskly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you face that stormagain . " She hurried off to the kitchen , leaving Matthew wondering atthe tone of her voice . It sounded almost as if she were glad . As soon as they were alone again she questioned him . What would he do ? Should they leave at once ? And there was something queer about the way in which she accepted his statement that they could safely delayuntil spring . All the while that he was explaining how Indians waited until the young leaves were large enough to hide their movementsbefore advancing on the settlements , he was watching her face . Shecertainly was not afraid , but she did seem disappointed , as if for some reason all her own she wanted to leave Albemarle Hall . Yetwhen he told her that there would be much to do to get the poorer neighbors in to the fort , her look of faint trouble changed to an expression that he could have sworn was wild relief. 138 THE ' IREE OF LIBERTY " I expect , " she said thoughtfully , " you will be kept right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was her one comment . He could not make her out . All through the winter and the early months of spring her actionswere everything he could wish . Where always before she had made him feel she resented his response to the neighbors ' calls for help , now she never once suggested that he send Norton on any errand that he could do himself . She made no complaint at all over the breaking of communication with the outside . Even when months went by with no word from Elm Hill she brushed aside his sympathyquite as if she shared the frontier 's tense drawing in on itself in face of its greatest danger . But he always had that sense of some strange reason moving her , something he could not understand , like the explanation she gave for her unflinching steadiness when the house was full of frightened women and children . " I find it right hard to be afraid of Indians , " was what she said . " I 'm so scared of the king . " " The king ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you afraid of him ? " He was amazed to see a sudden sparkle of mischief in her eyes . " You did , honey . But I 'm beginning to think now I can put him out of my mind . " What could any man make of a remark like that except that it was queer ? But Matthew knew whom to blame for any queerness of Jane 's . In every discussion of opinion he had ever had with her he had heard phrases that he knew were Fleetwood 's . If she was not standing by his side as Martha Wayles stood by Tom Jefferson , it was because her brother had deliberately taught her not to make her husband 's views her own . That damned aristocrat was able to influence her even in the Shenandoah , in spite of separations often years long , and in spite of all Matthew 's wooing . And now the Indianswere playing into his hand ! Matthew dreaded every passing day that brought nearer the time when he must move his family to the Tidewater . Yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in the fort that would be crowded with those who had no other refuge was unthinkable . He would have to take Jane to Williamsburg , but they should not stay at Elm Hill . To that at least he made up his mind . He would rent a house in town and plan during his absences to surround his wife with friends of his own choosing . It galled him to think how little this was which was all he could do . It seemed appropriate that he should waken on the May morning when they were due to leave the plantation to find the gardens blasted with unseasonable frost . He stared at the blackened plantsDIVERGENT ROOTS 139moodily . They were like the hopes which had gone to the making of those gardens . He and Jane together  --  always together  --  and now  --  Fleetwood and Williamsburg . Williamsburg in May of 1774 was fantastic to Matthew , newly come from tense preparation for the most terrible danger of the frontier . The brilliant little capital was in the midst of a gay season . All the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by four or six horses thronged Duke of Gloucester Street and the drives flanking the palace green ; for Lady Dunmore and the children had joined the Earl and were in residence . When the talk of Jane 's friends was not revolving about Mrs. Hallam and her husband , who were back at the theater with the London troupe of players and some fine new offerings , it was breaking up into disputesover the herald 's list which ranked the colonial officials and gave the precedence each might claim at court functions . The colony was threatened with Indian invasion , but the first recorded action of the assembled burgesses was an address of welcome to Lady Dunmore , and the first appropriation was for a ball to be given on May twenty-sixth in her honor . It all seemed criminal madness to Matthew , while Jane declared with satisfaction that at last the world was growing sane . And in a situation where he plainly needed all the reinforcementpossible he was disappointed in his house . He wanted to be at the west end of town . Thomas Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept at Monticello by the babies , the second barely a month old , and he was staying with his sister-in-law , Mrs. Eppes , on the Jamestown Road . If Matthew had been able to be near him , Jane would have found herself in the center of her husband 's interests . But as luck would have it , the only place available when they reached town was near the eastern end of Francis Street , close to the Capitol , with a nest of aristocrats almost next door at Bassett Hall . It seemed to Matthew , as he sat on the steps with Jane the first evening to enjoy the cool dusk , that the very air was full of ironic silken rustlings . It was a relief when Jefferson came riding up with a breathless message from Peyton Randolph . " An express from Boston , Matt . The Committee meets upstairs in the Capitol . " As Matthew stood up he could see between the houses across the street that candlelight was already streaming from the committeeroomwindows . Jane had risen too , and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not bad news , lass , " he said , thinking to quiet what might be fear.
