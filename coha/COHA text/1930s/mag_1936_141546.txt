TO MY FATHER-Charles Wertenbaker - Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2.50 ) . <P> After the Civil War the migration of ambitious Northerners to the South was sufficiently widespread and significant to win the careful attention of historians and sociologists . The reciprocal movement of Southerners to the North has been a subject for novelists , since it took place slowly and unobtrusively and since it involved the transplanting of people who were still tied emotionally to the regions they had lost . Last week the uprooting of one Southern family formed the subject of a brooding , sympathetic novel by a young Virginian whose seriousness of purpose had not been revealed in his earlier books . Born in Lexington , Va . 35 years ago , Charles Wertenbaker began his career as a novelist with a lively story of adolescent cain-raising called Boojum ! , followed it with another cut in the same pattern , Peter the Drunk , and with an amusing volume of short stories about his school days at Episcopal High . A more ambitious and responsible piece of work than any of these , To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its costly struggle to locate itself , is written with an intensity that sustains its interest through its 499 pages . <P> It begins with Charles Chastain 's memories of his first trip North . Traveling with his patient , tactful , observant mother , Charles was old enough to wonder if the Yankees were still having a war up in their country , to sense his parents ' social isolation in New Castle , Del. , where they settled . Capable , indecisive , troubled , Dr. Chastain at 32 had left Charlottesville because he could not wait for a post at the University to be offered to him . He told his son that the Yankees had been licking Southerners at business for a hundred years , but that the South still turned out good doctors , good officers , good lawyers , in such abundance that they could not make a living at home . Dividing his boyhood between Delaware and Virginia , Charles found himself at ease with his easygoing , impractical kinfolk in the South , wary but impressed in the circles of his Northern companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia belles , formed a deeper friendship with a tall , unaffected girl named Terry Mullikan , loafed at the University of Virginia until he was suspended , shipped on a freighter , worked on newspapers , married the beautiful , domineering only daughter of a well-to-do family . With her he went to Paris , lived a life of futile anxiety until , under the pressure of conflicts and suspicions that are not clearly described , he grew increasingly morbid , tormented his wife with his nervousness . Meanwhile his mother had died , his talented brother had gone through a cycle of bitter conflicts and his father , old Dr. Chastain , had prospered in Wilmington without making an adjustment with his environment . Charles returned to the U. S. , recovered his sanity when he met Terry Mullikan again , fell in love with her . Back in Virginia with her , he studied medicine , prepared to take the University post his father had missed years before .                    @
