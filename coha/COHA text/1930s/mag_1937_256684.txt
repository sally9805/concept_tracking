In Clay County , Ill. , on a farm for which the county might have been named , 60-year-old Bunyan Travis lived and labored , sweating in the noonday and sometimes cursing the bread he earned , for Bunyan 's acres were scrawny with drought and his back was bad with rheumatism . Finally he got him a cane to hobble around on . Chance came to Farmer Travis last spring when a gang of husky young men from the Southwest put up a derrick on his land and began to drill for oil . On May 23 they brought in an oil well which produced nearly 3,000 barrels the first 24 hours . That day Farmer Travis threw away his cane . <P> All summer through southern Illinois such tales as this have been the fresh coin of conversation in beer joints , barber shops , boarding houses , depots and town halls , adding their drawled excitement to the bustle and clank of an authentic oil boom . Farmers had their first intimation of it early last year when Chicago 's great Pure Oil Co. started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country east and south of Vandalia . <P> By last week 115 test wells were drilling in 21 counties of Illinois ' central basin and 75 wells were producing 10,000 barrels a day in Clay , Marion and Richland counties . First strike in Richland was the Ohio Oil Co. ' s " Arbuthnot No. 1 , " brought in fortnight ago with a flow of 2,561 barrels the first day , which seemed to prove a 30-mi. extension of the known producing area . Close-mouthed oilmen now predict that the first year 's production from Illinois ' new fields will be between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 barrels . <P> This is a small tributary indeed to the vast flow from U. S. oil fields , which last week for the 17th time since January 1 broke all records with an average production of 3,651,000 barrels per day . But for Illinois it is a revival of hopes forgotten during the quarter-century when the State 's oil production dwindled from a peak of 33,000,000 barrels in 1910 to a scant 4,000,000 last year in the old pumping grounds near the Indiana border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool south of Vandalia , where a smart , young Texas company , Adams Oil &; Gas , got in first and now has more than half of the 20 producing wells . Richest potential producer is Pure Oil Co. , locally known as " The Pure , " which brought in the well on Bunyan Travis ' farm and now holds oil rights on 282,000 acres . <P> The Pure . In a scientific industry , Pure Oil Co. has long distinguished itself for the success of its geologists . When the first commercial oil well was drilled in Michigan twelve years ago , Pure Oil men conferred with engineers of Dow Chemical Co . ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) , drew maps from salt well records showing probable oil structures near Mt . Pleasant . After buying leases on 500,000 Michigan acres the company proceeded to open up one of the big fields which have since made oil Michigan 's third most important industry .
