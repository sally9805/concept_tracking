T IME : One hundred years ago . The mechanical era is in the gristle . There is steam power . Machines have been hitched to steam engines , and there are factories and coal smoke and tall chimneys , but no railroads , no steamships , no electricity , no telegraph . The locomotive is in a state of fantastic idea . The world 's commerce is moved by man power , animal power , canal and sailing ship . The swiftest communication is by post road and courier . And yet there has been already a great industrial crisis from what people name overproduction , causing poverty , hunger and unemployment in the factory towns of England and France . Already a school of antagonists , moved by the spectacle of people unable to buy and consume what they are able and willing to produce , is denouncing industrialism , the industrial system , the crude machine . One of this school is the celebrated economist , Sismondi , saying : " Owing to the competition among workers , as a result . of excessive population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthens competition , diminishes wages , provokes a more intense effort on the part of the workman and forces him to extend his working day . " He believes free competition , anarchy or production and uncontrolled change to be the triple cause of human misery . The state , he says , ought to restrain the multiplication of inventions . He addresses himself directly to the savants , begging them to cease from inventing more machines . Others of the same antagonistic school , like Fourier , are crying " Back to the land ? " or " Disperse the cities ! " In their terminology there are two classes only . The rich are those who own and control the machines ; the poor are those who mind them . They alI assume that there is wealth enough for everybody 's happiness , if only it can be divided . The relative poverty of human society is invisible to them . TIME : Fifty years ago . The mechanical era is in the hone . Industry is still belted to the steam engine , but its power has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities it has much more than doubled  --  and yet there is food in plenty and running over , because now railroads are walking all over the continents of Europe and North America , and steamships are parting the seas , so that not only may grain flow as by gravity from surplus to deficit areas but the cost of moving it is almost nothing . The ocean freight rate from New York to Liverpool that was twenty cents a bushel now is two cents , and the railroad freight rate by land has fallen from three and a half cents per ton mile to seven-tenths of a cent . For the first time in the history of the human race on this side of the world , fear of famine is banished . There is a price to pay . From the speed and cheapness of steam transportation , new and far-away lands have acquired value , but at the same time the near , old lands have been wrecked in value . This is the beginning of the steel age . The cheap Bessemer-steel process has been invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seventeen dollars a ton . That is only the extreme case . Large-scale machine production has cheapened the cost of all goods . The telegraph has altered time . There is chaos in all values . A price structure has fallen . Old profits and old capital have been swept away as by flood . Of everything there seems suddenly too much , and no profit in it . Agriculture , industry , transportation  --  they are all frightfully depressed . Much of this change has happened suddenly ; and because it has happened suddenly , a sense of relation and rhythm is lost and there is a worldwide economic crisis , in fact and in feeling . There is terror of the machine that needs never to sleep or to rest , and is most profitably employed when it is denied both ; the machine that , by continually displacing human labor , is a monster devouring employment . Again that strange spectacle of people unable to buy and enjoy what they are able and willing to produce . What shall society do with its surplus labor  --  with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing their work and who can not buy because they can not be employed ? In England it is terrible . There an eminent churchman who works among the poor is saying : " The one thing which I and those associated with me always at once peremptorily refuse to do is to try and got men , women and children work to do . I say at once , That is impossible . To get you work would be to deprive some other one of work , and that I can not do . " ' In this country an eloquent publicist is saying to the Ethical Culture Society of Philadelphia : " 1 see no way out . There is not room in our industrial system for all our people , More things can be produced than people can buy . There is work enough  --  honest work  --  for only two-thirds of the population . Either people have got to shrink to the proportions of industry and thousands die , kill themselves in battle , or somehow lake themselves of from the face of the earth , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He proposes to colonize those whose labor is unwanted and settle them in isles of refuge where they may plow and dig and hake and weave , and so achieve their own subsistence , without disgrace , yet on a low plane . Fourier again . Back to the land . A committee of shoe manufacturers is saying to a. committee of Congress : " Do not blame the manufacturers for trying to reduce wages nor the operatives for resisting . The supply is greater than the demand . The market is not large enough . But give us the legislation we are asking for , and we could soon push ourselves into a position where the world 's buyers could not afford to buy on any other market . " Science Joins Hands With Industry THEY do not say what will happen in that ease to 1 the manufacturers and operatives in . ) 1 her countries where , also , supply is greater than demand . A new school of antagonists is denouncing the industrial system . free competition , anarchy of production , uncontrolled change . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it does n't , civilization will perish . They propose , variously , that prices shall he restored by inflating the currency , that . production shall be controlled by law , that work shall he spread by an edict to limit the hours of labor to eight in one day , where it has been ten and eleven , and that the government shall redistribute wealth . Again , it is assumed I hat there is wealth enough , if only it can be distributed . The problem is not bow to produce anything more . It is how to divide existing production . Therefore , divide the work until everyone has a job , in order that everyone may he able to buy . Thus the total product will be properly consumed . And again , the relative poverty of society is invisible . it is so much richer than it was fifty years before that it seems rich enough . How much richer it may be is unimagined . The world at . this time is still lighted by the gas flame and the coal-oil lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no oil industry but for kerosene . There is no electrical industry for light , heat and power . The limit of power transmission is a belt turning on pulleys . There is no fabricating steel industry for steel bridges , steel buildings and skyscrapers . There is no such thing as an automobile ; therefore , no motor-ear industry . There is no industry founded on synthetic chemistry , because there is no synthetic-chemical industry . No concrete highways , no motortrueks and busses , no wireless , no radio , no telephone system , no aviation , no movies , no electrical appliances , no elevators , no subways ; and the word " automatic " has still to be looked up in the dictionary , for the machine is not yet an automaton . It is but a tireless , mindless extension of the human members , still in its first . character , only gigantically magnified . TIME : Now . The mechanical era is in its third age . The facts are more complex . To man 's daring with machines has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superseded by mass production , and it is not the same thing . For large-scale manufacture it was necessary only to increase the power of engines and set more and bigger machines in a raw . In mass production you take unlimited power for granted , and think only of its quality and suitability . Beyond power there is a science of production engineering , a science of management , a science of method , a whole new world of technology . The nature of the machine has changed . the last fifty years . And yet there is an abundance of food  --  a surplus of it  --  because , for one reason , science has multiplied the yield of every grain-bearing grass , every edible plant and root , every food tree ; and because , secondly , the application of power and machines to agriculture has so magnified man against Nature that one may now perform with ease as much as ten men did before . Industry and science acting upon agriculture have revolutionized it . Science acting upon industry and industry acting upon itself , industrial method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  namely , to cheapen production . Not to cheapen the quality of anything  --  quality has been steadily improving  --  but only the cost of producing it , particularly the labor cost , by increasing the product per man and per hour of manual labor . Back to Sismondi for Solution AND row again a grave economic crisis . Another price structure has fallen . Old profits , old capital , old methods are going over the dam , for all any government can do to save them . There is chaos in values . The rhythm is broken , all relations are abnormal , a sense of continuity is lost . And this again is from what we continue to name overproduction . Of everything there is suddenly more than can be sold or used  --  a surplus of food , a surplus of goods , a surplus of raw materials , a surplus of machines , and , in consequence , a great . surplus of labor . The evil of unemployment returns . The actual extent of it is so much greater than ever before that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same old evil , wearing the same face , and we are saying about it the same things we have said before . An eminent English scientist is saying : " Let us declare a science holiday , until the world can catch up . " Echo of the Swiss economist. , Sismondi , who , before railroads and steamships , was saying ; " Let inventions cease , at least for a while . " The automatic principle now is inherent , so that machines are self-controlling and self-minding . There are machines that act by seeing , hearing and feeling ; machines that seem to think . For example , the automatic loom that stops itself when the thread breaks , mends it , and starts itself again , wherefore now in a weaving shed you may see forty men watching four thousand looms where formerly the textile industry required four thousand weavers for four thousand looms ; or the telephone-dial machine that finds your number and rings it by its own tactile sense and reflex . People are beginning to speak of the manless factory . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country it has much more than doubled in We are saying , as Sismondi said , and as others said fifty years after him , that human misery is from machines that devour employment , and from free competition that results in an anarchy of production , or , that is to say , from uncontrolled change and from surplus . We can hang the sun on a steelyard and weigh it , we can tear an element apart as if it were a rag doll , and yet this spectacle which we create ourselves  --  the spectacle of people being unable to buy and enjoy what they are willing and able to produce  --  is apparently the same enigma it was one hundred years ago . Because people are unemployed , they can not buy ; yet it is precisely because people can not buy that people are unemployed . There is not , enough work because there is not enough buying ; ' there is not enough buying because there is not enough work . How absurd it sounds ! And we have been making that sound from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed fifty years ago hardly a trace survives today . What survives in kind has been made over two or three times , and so much wealth of new kinds has been added as to change the human environment almost beyond recognition . We are saying now , as people said one hundred years ago , and as they said again fifty years ago : " There is already wealth enough , if only it can be divided . Society is rich enough . The trouble is distribution . " If this is not a delusion still , then there is no meaning in anything that has happened , no meaning to this crisis , and all those means to the further increase and further cheapening of divisible wealth that have been newly imagined , discovered and invented shall be buried in one grave with the idea of progress . We shall have a static society , tending to retrogress . We shall need no plan . Change will trouble us no more . The relative poverty of human society was invisible to those who said there was wealth enough one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thought society was rich enough fifty years ago . Who will say it is not invisible to us now ? The Less  --  Work-More-Pay Delusion S UPPOSE invention had ceased , suppose production had been limited and change restrained , suppose by any means all existing wealth had been divided into consumption one hundred years ago , before railroads and steamships ; or , again , fifty years ago , before motor cars . Or suppose  --  and it comes to the same result  --  that at either time the total amount of work dust necessary to produce that total amount of wealth which seemed enough had been divided by the total mu-ober of workers , to determine how much less hence no unemployment ; and then no change in wage schedules , in order that , although people shall work less , they may consume as much as before . Simply , the old delusion again . Fifty years ago , in a similar crisis , the eight-hour day was proposed instead of the ten-hour day , and on the same ground . The eight-hour day did come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the return of prosperity , and not until science , technology and a tremendous increase of mechanical power per worker had made it possible for people to produce in eight hours not as much as they had been able to produce in ten , but more  --  en uch more ! From the beginning of the mechanical era until now , the hours of labor have been shortening . They have been almost halved . And all the time wages have been rising . They have doubled and doubled again . But . no step in this progress has ever been made by dividing a given amount of work into a greater number of hands . Each step has been made possible by creating new work for the labor released from old jobs . What else we are saying in this crisis is nearly all borrowed from the past . Let the Government restore make believe to see them , they would have devoured us long ago . We put them there , and conceal from ourselves the truth that their ugliness is what we have done to what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the profit motive , to our own prosperity and well-being . We may perceive them separately , with the eye of obsession ; or , again , as most of us do , we may see them as parts of a whole , all pertaining to one zoological order , and that order is the industrial system . Planning the Economic Future T O DENOUNCE one part or one principle of the system involves you in many debatable particulars , but to denounce the system as a whole , as now it is the high fashion to do , involves only an attitude and a conclusion . The only new thing in this , since first there was any such thing as an industrial system to speak of , or to blame , is that many who may be supposed to speak for it now join with others to denounce it for taking us again and again into this region of fear , despair and enigma . Leaders of industry themselves are proposing to do what only the antagonists proposed before ? namely , to stabilize industry by coercion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to control change . A planned economy hereafter . There is a passion fur planning the economic future in a. rational manner , so that prices , values , supply , demand , employment , production shall never he in this state of chaos again . But . who could have planned railroads and steamships before they appeared , or what plan could have everybody should work in order that all should share in what work there was and so be able to buy and consume what divisible wealth there was . That might have seemed to solve the problem of unemployment , but , in fact , it would have brought society to a condition of universal partial employment , as if industry had been a worn-out land unable either to support any more people or increasingly to reward the full human exertion . Yet this now is one of the major proposals . Thera is a national propaganda , suggested by the Government , for " spreading the work . " As a mitigation , in a time of extreme emergency , there may be nothing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a five-day week and a six-hour day as a cure , so that everybody may be employed to produce as much as before , prices by inflation  --  that is to say , by debasing our money . Industry must be stabilized . Production must be controlled by a plan beforehand . Some say , very earnestly : " Prices do this to us ; therefore , let its abolish prices . " Others say : " No , it is n't prices . Money does it to us . Therefore , let us invent a new kind . of money . " Others : " It is neither prices nor money . The banker does it . Let the Government take over banking and control credit in the public welfare . " Others : " It is the profit motive . Away with the profit motive . " And many are saying , as Fourier said one hundred years ago : " Back to the land . Disperse the people out of the cities before they perish . " The economic horizon is a zoo of blamable beasts not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we anticipated the change they brought ? Who , fifty years ago , could have planned a motor-ear industry , and what would any plan have been worth that did not include that agency of uncontrollable change ? Is there a plan that will secure to its all the benefits of change without the price ? The prim is what is hurting us now . It is the price of further progress in material well-being . But the price itself is all we seem to be thinking of , and we treat it as an indictment , not of our own vast and collective follies , but of the anonymous industrial system . It is a terrific indictment , certainly . The League of Nations , in its World Economic Survey , 1931-32 , says : " A rough calculation at the depth of the UNEMPLOYNEENY-WEAT 11 , S B72 ) ( Continued from Page 5 ) economic depression , in the spring of 1932 , gives a total of twenty to twenty-five million workers unemployed in the world . . . . From any point of view , unemployment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It carries with it the risk of deterioration of skill and morale , of lowering the vitality and hindering the education and industrial training of large numbers of the people of every country . Unemployment is now on such a scale that this risk threatens not only adults but young persons , and , through the privation of their parents , young children . The cost of alleviating distress and minimizing these risks of deterioration is a heavy burden on the budgets of most countries , but the social consequences of reducing that burden . . . are sufficiently clear to forbid much budgetary reduction . . . . It is perhaps sufficient to quote the conclusion of a recognized expert on the whole question of unemployment and relief : Unemployment remains , in 1930 as in 1909 , a problem of industry , not an net of God . The problem of unemployment  --  this is a point that can not be too strongly emphasized  --  is insoluble by any mere expenditure of public money . ' " Direct and Indirect Losses Take it in this country alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they do nowhere come up as a whole  --  but to represent relations and orders of magnitude . In this country alone : 1 . More than ten million workers unemployed at one time . That is to say , nearly one-fourth of all the people who might be gainfully employed in agriculture , manufacturing , mining , forestry , transportation , trade and service . They are out of work . 2 . A sudden shrinkage in the national pay roll amounting to somewhere between ten and fifteen billions of dollars a year  --  the shrinkage , that is. 3 . From the unemployment of human hands and the idleness of machines a loss , during three years of depression , of time that can not be reversed and of wealth that might have been produced which you may estimate to the value of fifty to eighty billions . 4 . The loss represented by unemployment relief , private and public , rising in the third year to maybe a billion dollars . In the social body unemployed workers are not as dead cells . They are devouring cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what it costs to do this is a total loss . There is nothing afterward to show for it . With what it has already cost in three years of depression , we might have built another isthmian canal , across Nicaragua . 5 . The loss of morale and the political liability of creating in millions of people habits of economic dependence and the expectation of refuge in public credit . 6 . The total inability of industry to guarantee that all of this will not happen again , as it has been happening for one hundred years , each time on a greater scale , and 7 . The unexplained and dread experience of human misery and want in the midst of surplus , apparently because there is surplus . There is no doubt about the facts . They are overwhelming . And having faced them , one is moved to ask what is wrong with our industrial system . Not what are its defects , but what is fundamentally wrong in it . The conclusion seems , at sight. , irresistible that there must be something deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again to this impasse with itself . And yet it may be that in asking this question we are asking only what is wrong with human life in any environment that it should be always in trouble , what is wrong with human nature , what is wrong with ourselves . There is a saying that if industry had had only the vision to see the road a little way ahead and the chasm there , it need not have gone over the edge . It might have put on the brakes . But who is industry ? Who shall personify it ? Who shall see for the whole of it ? Then we say that if industry is nobody in particular , or nobody that can be held responsible , it is time the state should do the seeing , keep its hand on the brakes and set them in time . Well , the state may have eyes . This Government 's financial eye is the Federal Reserve Board , sitting in the United States Treasury , with jurisdiction over the Federal Reserve Bank System . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some glimpse of the danger and tried to throttle down the gas with which we were running headlong to disaster . The gas was credit And with what result ? Not industry alone , not business alone , not Wall Street alone , but popular opinion also turned upon it with animal ferocity . By what right did it propose to hinder prosperity ? Where was its certificate of wisdom ? The road was clear . Never had there been a road so clear and straight . This , you will recall , was in the time of great delusion . Everybody was profit-mad and money-mad and buying-mad . And if the Federal Reserve Board had suddenly arrested the momentum and had saved us from going over the cliff at the cost of only a few bad humps , and then nothing else had happened , we should now be saying that nothing else would have happened , and , perhaps , be passing a law forbidding the Federal Reserve Board ever to reach for the gas or the brakes again and bump us around like that . When New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production increased and costs declined , if industry had raised wages instead of capitalizing corporation profits in Wall Street in a way to create a gambling frenzy for common stocks , much of this disaster might have been avoided ; for thus people 's buying power would have risen with production and they would have been able to buy and consume what their labor increasingly wrought . This is a very strong argument , and to some indeterminate limit it is valid . But as a formula it is incomplete . In that way , of course , we might have gone on buying , for example , more and more motor cars until every family had at least two and some families six  --  and until at last you could n't have sold any more motor cars if you sold them in ten . cent stores . And so with everything else . We might have gone on and on to the point of utter satiety . Then what ? Probably by that means we should only have postponed what has hap- , pened , and it might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry ? that again and again a time comes when the production of certain familiar things may be expanded beyond any visible or imaginable demand . Then arises the necessity to expand , not the productions of these things but the range of human wants . There is the necessity to create new things . There was and still is that necessity . How iL shall be met we do not see , any more than people could see what industry should make by machine in place of a surplus of textiles one hundred years ago , or in place of a great surplus of raw steel and ginghams and buggies and wagons fifty years ago . We do know that it is a weakness of human nature to await necessity , even for a while to tlee from it instead of running to meet it . And nothing that may ever he imposed upon industry by the state in the way of restraint , forethought , wisdom or social-mindedness will alter that truth . A New Name for Old Conditions However , as concerning the indictment , although there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility , nevertheless , that the indictment itself is unsound by reason both of things left out and things assumed . For example , it is explicit in the first premise that machine industry is itself to blame for unemployment , or . in another way . that this great evil was born into the world with it . That we take this for granted shows how Little we know about unemployment and how easily a new word persuades us that we are gazing at a new thing . The word is new . But unemployment , with all its social , political and economic implications , is historic .. The pyramids , perhaps , are monuments to unemployment . The public bread and the public circus were to quiet the unemployed and unemployable of Rome , called the mob or the rabble . In England , when everything was handmade , two or three centuries before the advent of the mechanical era- , unemployment was a chronic and ghastly evil . The victims were the poor , the paupers and the beggars . Hence poor relief , the poor rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word " unemployment " was not used as we use it , to indicate an economic condition , yet the misery of the unemployed was such as nothing we can now imagine . At Norwich , in 1571 , the specifications for a workhouse were that it should be a place " as well for men as for women , viz. , for the men to be prepared fourteen malt querns " ( hand-grinding mills ) " to grind malt and such exercises ; and for the women to spin and card , and such like exercises " ? from five of the clock in the morning to eight of the clock at night . The first royal act requiring the unemployed to be set to work was " 18 Eli's. , e. 3 , " year 1575 : " Also to the intent youth may be accustomed and brought up in labor and work , and that such as be already grown up in idleness may not have any just excuse in saying they can not get any service or work , and that other poor and needy persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be it ordered that in every city and town within this realm a competent store and stook of wool , hemp , flax , iron or other stuff shall be provided . Collectors and governors of the poor shall , and may , of the same stock and store , deliver to such poor and needy persons a competent portion to be wrought into yarn or other matter , and the same being wrought , to be from time to time delivered to the said collectors and governors of the poor , for which they shall make payment . according to the desert of the work . " In 1631 the Privy Council is writing to the Justices of Rutlandshire about a shoemaker of Uppiugham who , because of " the present want and misery sustained by the poorer sort in those parts through the dearth of corn and the want of work , " had been stirring up the poor thereabout to mutiny and insurrection , in this manner : " ' Nearest thou , ' saith a shoemaker of Uppingham to a poor is your motionl " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of Okeham have sent to us poor men of Upping-ham , and if you poor men of Lidding-ton will join with us , we will rise , and the poor of Okeham say they can have all the armour of the country in their power within half an hour , and in faith tsaith he ) we will rifle the churls . ' " Wherefore , the Privy Council directs the Justices of Rutlandshire to lock up all the weapons in the county , " and likewise that you deal effectually in causing the market to be well supplied with corn and the poor to be served at reasonable prices and set on work by those of the richer sort , which is indeed the best means to prevent all disorders in this kind . " Modern Evils in the Middle Ages Hear the complaint of the old English watchmakers : " That in consequence of a too-minute division of labor , the workmen employed are not enabled to make throughout any one article , or even to maintain themselves by their industry ; that the unlimited introduction of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus of manufacturing poor , and an unnecessary competition , ruinous to the commercial capital and industry of the country ; because the overflow of goods causes all manufactures to fall in price and be sold to foreigners for less money than they cost in making , which deficiencies are made up by the ruin of the master manufacturers , bankruptcies and dividends to creditors . " Technological unemployment , overproduction , dumping in foreign markets , in the age of handicraft . By 1700 unemployment relief in England , called poor relief , had become a staggering social and moral problem . There were too many people in England ; a surplus of labor and not enough work , That seemed to be the trouble . What else could it be ? It was Defoe , creator of Robinson Crusoe , writing economies before there was that word for the subject , who first challenged that idea . He wrote a pamphlet , beginning : " I humbly crave leave to lay these heads down as fundamental maxims , which I am ready at any time to defend and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hands to perform it , and , consequently , a want of people , not of employment . " How right he was ! For the work that lay just ahead of her , England would need ten times as many people as she had then . Her work was to bring the mechanical era to pass and then to lead it for one hundred years , to found an empire , to colonize and tame wild continents , to take possession of Ilse seas , to become the principle of stability and magnificence in the trade and commerce of the whole world . All this she did , never knowing beforehand how . only the way of it when the time came : but never did she get rid of unemployment . Now , when we speak of unemployment , do we know what we mean ? There it was in England long before machines . before international finance and war debts , before that economic Mier  --  dependence of nations which we now so anxiously regard ; there it was when the population of England was perhaps less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it was because there were too many people and too many apprentices . There are various kinds of unemployment , and employment like and unlike under various conditions . There is unemployment associated with scarcity and underproduction and want of machine industry , as for hundreds of years in China , where the bold has been etibelivided to the point at which the individual 's holding is not enough to keep him employed ; there is unemployment associated with surplus , under-consumption and excessive machine equipment , and where there is still deity of land , as in this country , in Ca nada , inAust ralia.Thereis technological unemployment , as when old trades u nd old methods are superseded by new . There is unemployment that is seasonal and cyclical , and unemployment of sudden general incidence in time of trade depression . And if all this may be explained , you will go only to further difficulties . There is bound to be unemployment in a society where change takes place at a rapid rate , of course ; MA there is bound to he unemployment . too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change ' takes place very slowly . Anil then this curious matter  --  that meter any conditions whatever there is a kind of person who will lie never unemployed , and at the opposite end of the scale the kind of person who will he always unemployed ; between these are other kinds , such as those who are inconstant to employment , and others who , though they may be constant to it , live , nevertheless , near the periphery and are certain to he cast off when anything happens . When Work Becomes a Bleming ' onsider the pfl8S0 til i ty that there is something deeply at fault in our attitude toward work , wherein we take it to he an Ada inie curse . Are we not always in flight from it ? In our ideal speeineations for a higher standard of living , leisure is set very high ; work is not included . Then , when such necessity overtakes us that work and plenty of it would seem a blessing , we turn to embrace it and are aggrieved that . it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A rave instinctively loving work would require no Milton to unwrite the curse and say : Adorn thus to Eve " Fair consort , the hour Of night , and oil things now retired to rest Mind us of like repose ; since God kith set Labor and rest , a-1 day and night , to giC11 , Successive , and the timely dew of sleep , Now falling with slumberous weight , inclines Our eyelids . Other creatures all day long Rove idle , unemployed , and less need rest ; Man hath his daily work of body and mind Appointed , which declares his dignity , And the regard of Heaven on all his ways ; While other animals unactive range , And of their doings God lakes no account . " A delusional , sudden triumph in the flight from work , meaning only a false ecstasy of prosperity such as that with which we crashed three years ago , is probably the one most crucial cause of unemployment in its present phenomenal character . However , the point here was but to suggest the triviality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to blame for it , according to the indictment . That is generally what they mean who say unemployment is the problem of industry . It is no more the problem of industry than it is the problem of society at large . Unemployment Facts and Figures Again , as touching the indictment , the least secure of all its counts , and . curiously at the same time , the one most widely accepted with no examination , is that which refers to the progressive nature of the evil since the advent of modern industry . Each succeeding major disaster , we say . is worse than the one before . What is to be said for higher and higher peaks if they bring only deeper and more dangerous chasms of depression , despair and unemploy-ment ? In the contrast of naked dimensions it is so . Such a thing as ten or eleven million unemployed was never known it i this country before . In proportion , it is not so . Never before was the population so large ; never before was the country so rich . Unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no greater  --  it may he less  --  than it was in the depression fifty years ago . That is something . But if you set it against the increase in the total wealth of the country during the last fifty years , the weight of it is so much less that we should he able to bear it easily and with fortitude ; and that is amazing . Imperfect as the statistics of unemployment are , they are better than none . Fifty years ago the unemployed were not vaunted at all . Say that at the extreme depth of that depression the number of unemployed was five millions ? that will he a reasonable estimate  --  and it was 10 per cent of the population . Say that at the extreme of this depression the number has been eleven millions . That is less than 10 per cent of ' Ow population . Roughly , unemployment has a lit tle more than doubled ; the population has much more than doubled . In 1880 , when there was said to be work enough for only two-thirds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of taking themselves off the earth , we were fifty millions . Now we are more than one hundred and twenty millions . At the extreme depth of this depression the number of unemployed was only one in six or seven of the ine crease of population since fifty years ago . In 1880 the number of people who might be engaged in gainful oecupne times was , according to the census , 47 per cent of the population ; in 1930 the number was 49 per cent . In 1880 the total national wealth was estimated at forty-five billions of dollars . Fifty years later the annual pay roll  --  wages and salaries  --  was approximately fifty billions of dollars . As you regard these figures , what will you say  --  that industry devours employment or creates it ? And will you say that you know what unemployment is and that machine industry makes it ? Nor does the annual pay roll , either here or in other industrial countries , represent the total disbursement . On the subject of wages and rising standards of living , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " There can be no reasonable doubt that in the first postwar decade the forces working toward higher standards of living were very strong in practically every country in the world . . . . In the wealthier countries , especially , there was a notable democratic extension of purchasing power , by reason of higher wages , the lower costs of mass production by rationalized methods , and new devices of merchandising , such as the installment system . . . . Apart from direct increases of earnings . however , there has been an increasing tendency toward the augmentation of real income by the provision of public services . They range from the efforts of state and municipal enterprise in the field of commercial and trading undertakings and public utilities to direct subsidies of various categories of the population . . The general drift of the public-utility and social services is almost inevitably in the direction of redistributing income in favor of the poorer classes . Such services must aim at universality , and they tend to be used more and more by those who can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everybody is now furnished by community services , but this part is naturally greater in the case of small incomes . Taxation , on the other hand , is progressive on the larger incomes . The provision of an increasing range of public services , therefore , provides a larger real income for a great number of the lower-paid members of a community , partly at the expense of the wealthier . This feet is clearest in the case of such direct payments as pensions , family allowances and benefits of various kinds , of which the outstanding example is recent years has been for unemployment . . . . The widespread acceptance of the notion of ' standards of living , ' and the associated conception of a ' minimum standard ' which society should in some way guarantee to every normal individual , is one of the most remarkable social developments of recent years . " Industry 's New Problem And what society can now afford more titan it could ever afford before is owing to machine industry , to unplanned industry as it is and has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , its selfness , its apparent irrationality , its inability to foresee change , to control change even in its own interest , and its train of frightful disasters . It was industry in this character that delivered people from a Malthusitin doom . The Malthusian doctrine was that population naturally increased faster than the means of subsistence , wherefore the excess might . expect forever to perish in it fringe of misery , unemployment and starvation . And this was so apparently true before the advent of machine industry that the logic of it east a pall over men 's thoughts . ? In the last one hundred years , population has increased faster than ever before in the history of the race . Ma , chine industry has sustained the increase ; it has employed a population the existence of which could not have been imagined before . Not . only has machine industry sustained this increase of the human kind ; it has enabled it to live better and better , to the point at which the problem is no longer how to satisfy its minimum wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , millions of unemployed now are better fed , better housed and better clothed , even though at public expense , than the fully employed were Fed and housed and clothed one hundred years ago working sixteen hours a day . Suppose fifty years ago you had been able to say to those who were then in despair about the future , seeing work enough for only two-thirds of the people and no way out  --  suppose you had been able to say to them this : " Do you say there are too many people and not enough work ? But some of you will live to see the population more than double and yet be fully employed . You will live to see an unskilled workman going to his job in a private vehicle , which will he called an automobile . An artisan will earn ten and twelve dollars a day for eight hours ' work . The annual pay roll  --  that is , the disbursement of wages and salaries in one year  --  will be more than the present value of your total national wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said ? They would have said : " We can not imagine it . But if this is true , our children will have nothing to worry about . Their troubles are over before they are born . " Then suppose you had said : " But you are wrong . They will have trouble , and they will say it is worse than any trouble you have known . For after all this change , which will surely happen , there will he another depression , similar to this one , only nineli wider and deeper , and 10 per cent of the population wilt again be unemployed . " To this they would have said : " But if what . you say is true , and surely happens , they will all be rich . Why should they have worry about . unem-ployment ? " And you had said : " But they will worry and they will be really in trouble . Everybody will he in debt . Those who had been getting ten and twelve dollars a day for eight hours ' work will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment-relief funds provided by the cities and slates to save them from hunger . " Bow fantastic that would have sounded fifty years ago ! This is not to he unsympathetic , nor to look away from the facts of human misery and privation from episodic unemployment .. It is , if possible , somewhat to straighten the view and to suggest that we are still primitives in this new economic environment , behaving toward it as a savage behaves toward Nature . In a season of plenty , we gorge and dance and spend in a spirit of uncontrollable extravagance . One lean year gives us trouble ; two or three in a row involve us in disaster , no matter how many fat seasons may just have passed in succession . The more of them , and the fatter they were , the greater will have been the extravagance and the worse will be the disaster when it comes . Think how many famines there had to be , and that for thousands of years a helpless , superstitious dread of them was constant , before the race learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the rhythms of Nature . These rhythms have never been conquered ; they are as unpredictable now as they ever were ; only famine and the fear of it have been done away with . It may be we shall have to learn from depressions how to adapt ourselves to the rhythms of this economic environment . Do you say that whereas the eccentric rhythms of Nature are beyond control , it is not so with those of industry ? We make industry ; we make its rhythms ; therefore , we can control them . But are we sure ? Invention and change , in this artificial world we have created , are as unpredictable as natural events . Whence conic the ideas that lead to discovery , then to invention , and so to mighty change , at once so destructive and creative ? No one can ease or say more than that it happens . Theoretically , it . is true , you might hothouse industry ; so also you might hothouse agriculture and remove it entirely from the hazards of Nature ; but if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS industrial goods would rise enormously , and that process of cheapening them for greater abundance which has been acting for one huialred years mrtslii be at air end . Moreover , if you did this with industry , you would have to do it over the whole world , for if all y one within then merle a discovery corresponding to the railroad , the steamship , the Bessemer-sleet process , the motor ear or 111111.11.1 production , ( eller nations would have to suppress it , by force if necessary , or submit again to the pewees of great change , with its terrific destruetion of old values in the way of creating new ones . Suppose we had never rightly understood what industry was for  --  atel this would not be strange , in view of the fact that it . began with no history al . rill . We do not complain of Nature that it knows no social function . Simply , it rewards human exertion , not at a fixed wage , not without seasons of unemployment and disaster but in the average as welt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry any social or paternal function . Try judging it as if its only function were to multiply divisible wealth in a progressive , prodigious mariner . The Philosophy of Labor has been the peculiar genius of organized labor in this teruntry to regard it somewhat from that point of view . In the philosophy evolved by the American Federation of Labor , there was a deep distrust of any political interference with this primary function . The relationship between capital and labor was conceived to be neither political nor social ; it was strictly economic . Beneficence on the part of industry toward the wage earner , or any paternal interest whatever in his social assets and private welfare , was resented , on the ground , among others , that the economic nature of the relationship was thereby modified , Give the wage earner his right wage . That was all lie asked of industry . In every other way lie would take care of himself and live as he pleased . Industry , therefore , as a vast , delicate , reciprocal mechanism , serving production as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more complicated a mechanism becomes , the more liable it is to be deranged by bud handling . But if it goes wrong , there is a logical reason for it . You would never think to say it had gone wrong because it was soulless , wrong-minded or antisocial . Naturally , in a time of extreme depression such a mechanistic idea of industry is weakened . There arises a demand that industry , besides serving the ends of production no less effectually than before , shall at the same time he required to foresee the social consequences of this function and assume moral responsibility for them , on the ground that people are increasingly helpless . Recently , for example , the American Federation of Labor , contrary to the philosophy it had so jealously built up , voted for compulsory unemployment insurance to he imposed by the state as a social charge upon industry . A time may conic when the cost of free progress in material well-being will be intolerable . Many believe that time is present .. Bet whether they are right or wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anxieties of depression . We have had it before , only to forget it . Is Progress Worth the Price ? Suppose it had been possible , one hundred years ago , to present a picture iir tits world as it is today , and say : " All this will come from that anarchy of production , planless competition and uncontrolled change you are beginning to denounce . The convulsions from tine ? to time will be terrific . Everything will have to he destroyed and made over again four or live times . There will be depressions , such as now you are complaining of , each one wider and deeper , only each time there will be relatively much more wealth of : ill kinds with which to absorb the disaster . You may be able to step it new . But if you let it go on . you will he unable to control it . For all it costs , will you have it ? " They might have been , of course , so terrified by the picture as to say : " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and provided they had been able to stop it , at least one-third of the people now existing in the world , and certainly one-half of those now existing on the western side of it , where most of the industry is , would never have been born . Simply , life could not have employed them . So now , what , if anything , is to he concluded ? Positive inferences in this material have been hitherto a vanity . In any previous major depression all the nhvious conclusions were wrong , as to say society was already rich enough , that there were too many people , that there was not enough work because maehine industry had devoured it . These were appearances only , but so tall end dense that , of course , people could not see their way out . Never were they able to see their way out . Always they have had to feel themselves out . Nevertheless , cent kin simplifications are indicated ; a few things are visible . First , as to sequels . Three only are possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a state of material wellbeing such us now we can not imagine ; ( h ) that we shall riot advance , but become static instead ; or ( r ) that we shall retrogress from this point . And since the first of these three sequels is the only one that can give us any new trouble , the other two requiring but our resignation until they can bring up their own solutions , the first alone is worthy to he considered . Secondly , as a conclusion from experience , we do not advance from peak THE SATURDAY or overcrowded , from gaining a new foothold or expanding one already occupied in this na t urally rich but sparsely settled continent , whether in Mexico , Central America or South America . This policy , which we call the ' Monroe Doctrine , is so old that its significance is easily overlooked . It has made for peace and for the security of many small , weak nations . But we have main tained it for a century , not for those reasons , which have been incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a " piece of international impertinence , " and Theodore Roosevelt said that it was only as strong as our Navy . Certainly , force , none the less real because not flaunted , has lain behind the Monroe Doctrine . It Is so easy to forget that . at the close of the Civil War , in 1866 , when we had the strongest Navy afloat and several hundred thousand of the most-seasoned troops in the world , both from the North and South , France reluctantly withdrew , at our urgent request , its support from Maximilian , the ill-fated archduke whom it had set upon the throne of Mexico . Naturally , under the circumstances , we did not have to send any troops or even ships to enforce the request . Coming down to more recent times , is it not significant that we never allow the Monroe Doctrine even to be discussed at peace , disarmament and other similar international con-ferences ? Backing Up National Policies Plainly , then , a Navy is for more than the defense of overseas possessions , foreign trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support or implement the whole complex of numerous national policies which have grown up , rightly or wrongly , fairly or unfairly , through the development of political , economic and social forces . A Navy does not advocate or question these policies ; as a servant or instrument of civil authority , it aims to have them peacefully respected , if possible ; if not , it fights for them . If we do not want a Navy , let us change these policies which are part and parcel of a century and a half of national growth . EVENING POST case before . They probably are . Then the question : How and where will they spend themselves ? To know the answer would be to know the further destiny of the human race here , But you do not need the answer . In a world only one-third developed , where , in the present state of productive knowledge , three times as many people might he contained in the web of life , where even yet one-half of the existing population is not within reach of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release of these creative forces , when they are released , is bound to prepare much more work than leisure . Trying , one hundred years ago , to project the consequences of machine industry , the political economist arrived at the celebrated image of one man producing everything by simply turning a winch . Then what ? There would be employment for only one man in a whole kingdom . What would everybody else do ? A human society without work to do , even though all its wants were satisfied , would probably destroy itself ; hut that is not . what they were thinking of . WET 1 NZVY ? ICorttfnued front Page 21 ) All this throws light on the argument that a Navy is too costly to maintain , that it is an economic burden or waste . Naturally , one must look at both sides of the account . The mere size of the figures involved is not the essential item , provided every reasonable economy is exercised ; what matters is the extent of the interests to be supported , together with the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction contains a greater element of wages to labor than that of naval vessels . Throughout our history , the Army or Navy , or both , has done a vast amount of incidental work in the way of scientific research , sanitation , disaster relief , colonial administration , canal and harbor construction , flood and river control , pioneering in the Far West , ed ucat ion , discipline and training . But . these are incidental matters , justified in the hands of the military only because of their defense requirements . At present the cost of each branch is substantially the same , the total being approximately 8700,000,000 . Tobacco consumed each year accounts for about three times this sum , and the taxes paid on tobacco would more than pay for either Army or Navy . Candy consumption would just about pay for either , and golf would more than pay for the other . Army and Navy together take 17.41 per cent of Fedoral appropriations , or , to present the picture more fairly , 5.5 per cent of all expenditures for government , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' relief , interest on public debt and retirement of public debt , all of which are lumped together with Army and Navy operation and maintenance by those who wish to show the enormous cost of wars , " past , present and future . " For 1932 , this makes 65.58 per cent of Federal appropriations , and if we take an average for the whole period of 191331 , which , of course , includes the World War , the average is 68.7 per cent . At first sight , this certainly makes a terrible showing for the burden of wars and armaments , but the average for this whole period is only 20 per cent. , if state and municipal expenditures be included , and somewhat less jAanugry /COI You see what was wrong with their image . They were projeeting the logical consequence of machine industry in the world as it was then . They did not see that machine industry would give man the power to transform his environment and extend it . prodigiously . They supposed that the quantity of work to he performed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that dine , so that labor-saving machinery could mean only heavenly leisure to be divided or , if it were not divided , then the misery of unemployment . It meant neither one nor the other . Each new machine to save time and labor did , of course , release labor from old employment , but at the same time it was like a blast in a quarry of unknown and invisible possibilities , bringing down an avalanche of new material to be acted upon . Well , there is less excuse now than there was then to suppose that the economic . world is finished . We have seen what . happens . We know better . Editor 's Note  --  This is the first of three articles by Mr. Garrett .. The next will appear in an early i , than 20 per cent if that portion of the public debt not properly chargeable to the war be excluded . Even a. small one-fifth seems like a large slice of all governmental expenses to go for military purposes . But the figures require still further analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration ac-Counts for 23.72 per cent . This is not the place to discuss the bonus . hospitalization for nonservice disabilities and other veterans ' questions which are at present the subject of such bitter controversy , except to say.that many people feel that much of this cost should be charged to polities rather than to national defense . The Cost of Unpreparedness But what really matters in this article and what goes to the heart of the subject . is that one-hall of all Federal expenditures-49.17 per cent in 1032 ? consists of veterans ' items , interest on public debt and retirement of public debt. , a large part of which is not so much chargeable to national defense as to its lack or very opposite . In other words , these vast items are largely the cost we must pay for having entered the World War unprepared . in fact , defensive preparations might have forestalled these expenses altogether . Colonel House wrote President Wilson on July 14 , 1915 : " If war comes with Germany , it will be because of our unpreparedness and her belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . " After the war lie wrote , in a prefatory note to one of his books : " I was sure , given a large and efficient Army and Navy , the United States would have become the arbiter of peace , and probably without the toss of a single life . " If we had begun to build up naval strength promptly in 1914 , and had thoroughly advertised the fact , we might , at a maximum cost of a few hundred million dollars , spoken with sufficient authority not only to have kept ourselves out of war but to have shortened it for the belligerents and saved the world untold billions . As it was , we waited until war was inevitable and then spent , in a flash of hysterical
