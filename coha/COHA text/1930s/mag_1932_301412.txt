Two of the ugliest professional athletes in the U. S. last week crawled through the ropes of a ring at Madison Square Garden . One was blubbery Ed ( " Strangler " ) Lewis , recognized by the New York State Athletic Commission as the heavyweight wrestling champion of the world . The other was crook-nosed Ray Steele , whose challenge the Commission had ordered Lewis to accept . <P> Half an hour later , Referee Eddie Forbes raised Lewis 's shaggy right hand , pronounced him still champion . Referee Forbes 's announcement was inaudible in the loudest , most prolonged booing ( 20 minutes ) that has ever occurred in Madison Square Garden . The bout had not ended in a fall . Instead , after stumbling about the ring with their heads locked like two foolishly embattled elks , Lewis and Steele separated , glared , grunted . Steele whacked Lewis on the face with the back of his hand . Referee Forbes warned him to refrain . Steele whacked Lewis three times more . Instead of disqualifying Steele , Referee Forbes warned him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match , lop-eared John Evko , climbed into the ring in his bathrobe , whacked Challenger Steele . Referee Forbes tried unsuccessfully to push Wrestler Evko out of the ring , then awarded the bout to Lewis on a foul . A disgruntled spectator slapped Promoter Jack Curley on the nose . Members of the New York State Athletic Commission prepared to investigate the bout . <P> The wrestling exhibition-in New York State it is improper to advertise wrestling as a contest-between Lewis and Steele was the result of a peculiar situation . Three years ago there were two claimants to the heavyweight wrestling championship of the world . Instead of wrestling each other , each continued to claim his championship , defend it against minor opponents . Christopher Theophilus ( Jim Londos ) , recognized as champion in New York State , made the most money , in matches arranged for him by promoter Jack Curley . Ed ( " Strangler " ) Lewis , recognized as champion outside New York State , finally lost his title on a foul to Canadian Henri De Glane . He then began persistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York State Athletic Commission ordered Champion Londos to wrestle Champion Lewis . When Champion Londos failed to obey , the Commission awarded his title to Champion Lewis on condition that Champion Lewis defend it first against fat Jack Sherry of Alaska , next against lumbering Ray Steele . By defeating Steele last week , Strangler Lewis became positively the only world 's wrestling champion in the U. S.
