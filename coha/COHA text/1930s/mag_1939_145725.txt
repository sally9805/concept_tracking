ROPE OF GOLD-Josephine Herbst-Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> In 1934 critics called Josephine Herbst 's The Executioner Waits one of the best novels of the year , ranked it and its predecessor , Pity Is Not Enough , just below the novels of John Dos Passes . A modern U. S. tragedy , told against a big background , these novels traced the history of the Pennsylvania-Dutch Trexler family from post-Civil War days to 1929 , at once took rank as one of the best chronicles of a U. S. average family and a social era . <P> Rope of Gold avoids the Depression , skips to 1933-1937 , a period which has ruined even more novels than the Depression . Josephine Herbst , however , comes through solvent . <P> An episodic novel that sprawls all over the place ( Pennsylvania , Michigan , South Dakota , New York , Cuba ) , Rope of Gold is equally prodigal with characters . The four main ones are an intellectual farm organizer and his wife ; a rising automobile manufacturer ; a union organizer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both much like those to be found in hackneyed left-wing novels . But Author Herbst is no propagandist ; there are no revolutions around the corner ; her characters move under their own power ; their crises occur inside themselves instead of on picket lines .
