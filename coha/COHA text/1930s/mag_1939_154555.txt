Tops among Hollywood writer-director teams for many a year were hairy little Frank Capra , who used to be a Mack Sennett gagman , and baldish Robert Riskin , who got into the movie business when a shirt manufacturer he was working for decided to take a flier in shorts . During the six years they worked together for Columbia , Capra &; Riskin turned out a dazzling string of critical and box-office successes , Lady For a Day , Broadway Bill , It Happened One Night , Mr. Deeds Goes to Town , Lost Horizon , You Ca n't Take It With You . They won their share of Oscars and some of the biggest money in the business . Last year they parted when Samuel Goldwyn offered Riskin a five-year contract ( reportedly worth $1,000,000 ) as an associate producer . Hollywood guessed that Capra , whose $350,000-a-year contract with Columbia had another year to run , was also on Producer Goldwyn 's list . <P> But last fortnight Bob Riskin , weary of the constant harangues that working for Mr. Goldwyn entails , threw up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week Frank Capra , completing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington under his Columbia contract , announced that , instead of signing another , he would rejoin Riskin in the fall as Frank Capra Productions , Inc . Since high-powered Screenwriters Gene Towne and Graham Baker have also set up shop for themselves this year ( TIME , May 29 ) , Hollywood saw a Trend . Though the Capra-Riskin production plans remained their secret , neither they nor anyone else thought they would have much trouble in financing as many pictures as they wanted to make , which will probably not be very many . " A good writer should be able to do two good pictures a year , " Writer Riskin once remarked . " Unfortunately , we all do several more than that . "
