Unknown to itself and to the U. S. public is the real American Federation of Labor . It is a jack of 1,619 trade unions , a many-millioned mass which has virtually no credo because within it is every credo under the U. S. sun . But there are other A. F. of L.s . The one usually labeled in newsprint as " the A. F. of L. " is a tight little club of 17 executive councilmen who expound and at intervals alter the otherwise missing credo . Last is the A. F. of L. which goes on show as " the annual convention of the American Federation of Labor . " <P> Last week the convention and The Club met simultaneously at Houston , Texas . Assembled in the lofty new Coliseum were 600 career men of Labor . Mostly they were gentlemen toilers who had worked up to union office and comfortable expense accounts . Plain men seated along pine tables , they daily went through the conventional motions indicated by their President William Green , a plain man whose career had been a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wives , retired to the movies or enjoyed simple sociability in hotel rooms . A minority frequented the convention 's one play spot , the roof of the Rice Hotel . <P> There , an escape from Texas ' statute forbidding sale of liquor by the glass was provided by a stratagem whereby the ingredients were given away , and a reasonable sum was charged for transportation from bar to tables . The Rice was also headquarters of the Executive Council . In &; out the doors of the Council 's rooms passed tiny , wax-haired Matthew Woll of the Engravers ; smart , tough Dan Tobin of the Teamsters ; Dan Tracy of the Electrical Workers ; smart , smooth John Coefield of the Plumbers . Still a councilman by virtue of his long service , snow-haired Secretary-Treasurer Frank Morrison ambled about in lonely dignity . <P> Law-Making . Principal business before the council was the Wagner Act . Having previously determined to amend it in some fashion , they debated just how far to go in rewriting a statute which has not worked out altogether to their benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the council in its annual report , " the administration of the law by the National Labor Relations Board was , on the whole , just and proper . . . . Since the decisions ... the Board has abandoned whatever restraint it imposed upon itself . . . and has brazenly and by official acts declared itself a proponent of the C. I. O. ... " <P> The councilmen recommended that the law be amended so as " to curtail the unlawful assumption of broad powers by the board , also to curtail unlimited discretion in construing and administering the Act , and to make specific the jurisdictional limits of the Board . " Specifically : to restrict or abolish NLRB 's power to void contracts between employers and unions , require NLRB to recognize craft lines in designating bargaining units , forbid it to sanction independent or " company " unions , reduce its quasi-judicial powers .
