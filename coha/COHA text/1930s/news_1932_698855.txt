txt " Please , sir , I want to cancel my bonus . " The official on duty at the counter of the United States Veterans ' bureau today looked up in amazement at the modestly dressed veteran who was speaking . After hours of hearing demands for more bonus money , more compensation and more attention , the weary official was not sure he had heard correctly . " You i really want to cancel your bonus ? . " he asked . " Yes , sir . " , . " Why ? Are n't you entitled to it ? " " 0 , yes , sir , but I read in the papers that the government is hard up and I thought maybe they needed the money more than I did . " This was n't in regulations , so the man on the job scratched his head a few minutes and then excused himself to ask the advice of William Blake , manager of the bureau . Oddly enough Mr. Blake was not surprised . " I 've had such requests before , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it . You can not waive your right against the government . The money will be set aside for him whether he takes it or not . The best thing for , him to do is to take the money and pass it on to some one rye If he does n't need it himself .
