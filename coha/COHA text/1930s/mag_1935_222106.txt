In Kansas City last week the National Labor Relations Act , passed last summer to make employers bargain collectively with a majority of their employes , met its first constitutional test , went down to dusty defeat . Three Stouts , Charles , Warda and Alice , who own the Majestic Flour Mills at Aurora , Mo. , appealed to U. S. District Judge Merrill E. Otis for an injunction against a Labor Relations complaint . A majority of the Stout employes had organized a union , and demanded higher wages . This demand was granted . Then the unionized majority demanded that only union members be employed , that no union member be discharged except for cause regardless of whether his services were needed . These demands the Stouts refused . After a shutdown , they reopened their mill , offered to rehire all onetime employes individually . The Labor Board 's complaint cited the three Stouts for refusing to bow to the unionized majority in the mill , threatened them with a $5,000 fine , a year in jail , or both , for violations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otis granted a temporary injunction , declared the whole act unconstitutional . Said he : " Under the commerce clause , insofar as we are here concerned with it , Congress has power to regulate one thing only , this is : commerce among the several States . .. . <P> " Manufacturing is not commerce , nor any part of commerce . Nothing more firmly is established in constitutional law than that . . . . <P> " It is absurd to say that the refusal of the owner of a flour mill to bargain collectively with his employes directly affects commerce among the States . . . . <P> " The individual employe is dealt with by the act as an incompetent . The Government must protect him even from himself . He is the ward of the United States to be cared for by his guardian even as if he were a member of an uncivilized tribe of Indians or a recently emancipated slave . "
