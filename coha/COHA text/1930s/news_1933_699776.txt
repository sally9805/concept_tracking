txt The once excoriated " trust " is about to emerge as a " cartel " under the pending Roosevelt industrial control bill , with a corresponding reorientation of American economic philosophy sufficiently great to constants a new era . If the Roosevelt bill does not actually use the word " cartel . ' at least it is the European cartel system %%hien is proposed for American industry And the new program I not only adopts the cartel for its I model , but goes the cartel one better The cartel is the agency by which Europe , and particularly Germany . has established a " managed " industry . It is sanctioned by custo:n and by law , and involves . primarily , a voluntary association of independent Erms for the purpose of restricting competition by fixing prices , production and markets . The primary objective is to deprive tha individual firm of the ability to start cutthroat competition Two Major Differences This is the same program which the new Wagner bill nil put into effect in the United States , analysis reveals , with two major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be compulsory  --  forced by government pressure . European cartels do not deal with labor conditions . American cartels , under the Roosevelt-Wagner plan , will embody codes covering hours , wages , and working conditions . In other words , a very definite measure of social control is involved in the new United States set-up , implying a national interest in fair wages and raising inevitable quesHeirs as to redivision of national income . This is a drastic departure and a big extension of the cartel movement . Discussion with government officials here leaves no doubt that they Interpret the ** bill to terms of European cartels . " The two are substantially alike . " said Mr. Frederick M. Felker , head of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce . " Quite the same idea , " said Mr. Louis Domeratzky , United States Commerce Department authority on cartels . General approval of the " cartelization ' . of American industry as a natural outgrowth of the trade association movement was expressed , though the extent to which this marks a change in American policies was emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potash  --  are on a compulsory basis , according to Commerce Department information . The rest are voluntary agreements , running for a term of years . The German Government provides a special law regulating such voluntary associations . If a member firm should withdraw from the price-fixing cartel for insufficient reason , or if it should violate any provision , a special court would hall the firm before it , order it to rejoin the group , and probably fine it for breach of contract Before long just such action may be seen in the United States under the Wagner bill . Instead of fines for price-fixing. there will be fines for price-cutting . American firms are permitted to join international cartels , under the Webb-Pomerene Act it is pointed out . As such they have participated in acts abroad , with the approval of the Federal Trade Commission . for which they have been rigorously prosecuted at . home .

The theory is that when the big producer is forced into a csrtel , where consideration must be given to prices and conditions under which small producers can operate , a barrier is set up against . the tide of industrial concentration . In other cords , the " little fellow " gets a voice in industry . As America launches the cartelizalion program , two lessons are presented here from the European example . The first relates to prices . Too much can not be expected of the cartel in lifting prices when business is bad , it is said . " Experience shows that the cartel ca n't beat economics , " declares Mr. Felker on this point . The record shows that European cartels are now as hard hit by the business slump as anybody . " The cartel ca n't compel people to consume , " said Mr Domeratzky. " even though prices are fixed .
