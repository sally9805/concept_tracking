British censorship taboos ridiculing any living person on the stage . Ridiculing the King and Queen would strike most Britishers as unthinkable . Yet London is at present laughing its head off at a play whose characters , though not actually named , unmistakably include King George , Queen Elizabeth , Chamberlain , Hitler , Mussolini and the " Cliveden Set . " <P> Called Babes in the Wood , the show might well be mistaken for one of those innocuous fairy tale " pantomimes " so dear to British children of all ages . Produced by the left wing Unity Theatre Club , Inc. , Babes in the Wood keeps out of the Lord Chamberlain 's censorship clutches by being privately performed before " club members " who pay , not admission , but two shillings extra dues . Partly using the plot of the old fairy tale , Babes in the Wood introduces Chamberlain-umbrella and all - as " The Wicked Uncle , " Hitler and Mussolini as " The Robbers . " A Cabinet meeting at No. 10 Downing Street takes place in a privy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cliveden Set , led by Lady Astor , goose-stepping and giving the Nazi salute . <P> The King and Queen are good for many a laugh . When he complains of his duties , she retorts : " All right , be huffy and abdicate . " Thereupon he goes into a song called I 'm King Useless the Useless . When the Queen bids him bring about cooperation , " as you did in Paris , " the King replies : " Oh , so that 's what I did at Paris . "
