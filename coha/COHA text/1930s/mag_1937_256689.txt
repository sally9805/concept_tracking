Tired of lacing up his boots , a Chicagoan named W. L , Judson in 1893 devised the world 's first slide fastener . It worked badly , but it made an instantaneous impression upon Colonel Lewis Walker , a lawyer from Meadville , Pa . Colonel Walker spent the next 20 years and about $1,000,000 collected from a multitude of sources , before he began to achieve any commercial success with the gadget . Judson was unable to perfect it and it was not until 1913 that one Gideon Sundback developed the " zipper " as everyone now knows it . Started that year in a $300-a-year shack in Meadville , Hookless Fastener Co. , maker of " Talon " fasteners , immediately went to town , is now the biggest of 16-odd U. S. zipper makers . <P> Total Hookless production has never been revealed , for Colonel Walker and Son Walter Delawater Walker are incurably publicity-shy , but zippermen estimate it as about 35,000,000 zippers a year , or 75% of total U. S. production . Hookless ' only worry is Japan , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still undersell Hookless by 25% in the U. S. Last year Japan sold 26,000,000 zippers in the U. S. But Hookless has little to fear . FORTUNE estimated Hookless gross at $4,500,000 in 1931 , and it is presumably over $6,000,000 now , with profits near $1,000,000 . Total outstanding stock is only 3,906 shares and these are held by 145 persons . Last week this stock was valued at about $3,000 a share , when an announcement was made by Colonel Walker . Pondering plant expansion financed by a possible public offering of shares , President Walker proposed to split stock 250 for 1 , change the name of the company to Talon , Inc . Zip , the price of shares was bid up to $3,500 , but there were no sales .
