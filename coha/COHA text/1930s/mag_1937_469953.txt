IT is quite likely that what Franklin D. Roosevelt did will fill fewer pages in history than what he started . He has been hailed as the Messiah of the New Order . He may be only its John the Baptist . He has created an atmosphere , released forces , and set a trend in the United States which are as much more significant than the New Deal as they threaten to be beyond its control . Their curse or blessings will be upon the land long after Mr. Roosevelt , at some future inaugural , has moved over to give the right-hand seat in the White House car to his successor . How much they will be curse and how much blessing it is too soon to say . That is a problem not for the children , but for the grandchildren of the New Deal . Very few Presidents will be judged as little as Mr. Roosevelt will be in terms of what they put their names to while in office . Future Presidents , for a good many quadrennia , are likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his bog as the case may be . Whichever they are doing , none of them will be in any doubt as to whom he is indebted for the need to do it . Mr. Roosevelt may or may not occupy the White House after 1940 . But the consequences of Mr. Roosevelt are sure to occupy the man who does . Mr. Roosevelt may not have started out in public life to be President . There is some evidence that it was Mrs. Roosevelt who started for him . But once President , it was certain that he would never be content to be numbered merely as one of the Presidents . He was sure to aim to be one of the great Presidents . In that he was fortunate . The 1933 crisis did for him and his place in history what it has usually taken a war to do for other Presidents . If he had met that crisis and let it go at that he would have stood at least head and shoulders with any peacetime President . Even his enemies will agree , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit ? some of them in sorrow ? that he has not let it go at that . Like Woodrow Wilson , the way in which he waged the war is being eclipsed by the way in which he is waging peace . He may have more , or less , success than Wilson had . But his risk , like Wilson 's , is of his own making . Beginning in 1935 , when the economic tide had turned , he could have begun the progressive demobilization of the New Deal . He would have been elected just as handily in 1936 . His biggest 1936 assets were recovery and the Republicans . Moreover , had he demobilized the New Deal , the " Era of Good Feeling " which , in the weariness of the last days of the campaign , he seemed genuinely anxious to establish , might have come to pass . He could have been a recovery President and during these four years coasted comfortably to his place in history . But he chose otherwise . The only New Deal demobilization to date has been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court . The President 's policy toward the Supreme Court is proof enough that , far from seeking to escape or modify the long-time consequences of the New Deal , he accepts and is determined to increase and intensify them . He is the maker of those consequences . The question is : how far is he aware of them , does he understand them and , in the phraseology of his Madison Square Garden speech , will he be their master ? It is hard to believe that he is unaware of them . Despite the minds through which most of his information is filtered before it gets to him and the unwillingness of anyone to appear ? frequently at least ? as the bearer of bad tidings , he can hardly escape the fact that since his second inauguration Washington has been in a political ferment that has gone increasingly sour . Congress is no longer his echo chamber as it once was . His policies have brought a division in his own party between those who want to go on and those who want to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gulfs . These things are too obvious to be missed even inside the insulation of the White House . It is bard to believe too that he is unaware of the fact that these Washington phenomena arc not merely indicative of the perversity of politicians . They are signs of the times . It is too soon to say that the New Deal may turn out to be only a house of cards . But it is not too soon to say that the forces to the right and left of the New Deal ? which put Mr. Roosevelt in office in 1932 and kept him there in 1936 ? have finally fallen out . It is altogether unlikely that they will ever fail in again . Conservatives ? who have swallowed their conservatism and aided Mr. Roosevelt ? are turning conservative again . And the latter state of their conservatism is likely to be more hidebound than the former . Liberals ? who took Mr. Roosevelt 's half loaf as preferable to none ? are out to get the other half . And beyond established party lines , forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fighting unit , and accustomed to the smell of gunpowder and the spoils of war , the dispossessed , the workers , farmers , white-collar liberals " have only just begun to fight . " Their fighting will be less and less for Mr. Roosevelt and at his direction , and more and more through their own political organizations and for themselves . The President is too accurate an observer to be unaware of these things . And he is too good a politician to overlook the fact that , once it is finally determined that he is not to be the candidate in 1940 , his most potent hold upon his own party organization will be measurably loosened and the danger of New Deal disintegration rapidly increased . II But even though he is aware of all that is on the way , up to the present he has not had to meet it . And the first fact about the Roosevelt understanding is that it is better in action than in anticipation . It is dependent not so much upon mental discipline as upon external conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles in prospect . He waits for them to arrive . Until they do arrive he is likely to be indifferent to them and impatient of anyone who persists in bringing them to his attention . He thoroughly dislikes alarmists and prophets . Sufficient unto the day are the troubles thereof . His mind , in this respect , is at an opposite pole from Woodrow Wilson 's . Wilson was a scholar . Roosevelt is an observer . Wilson disliked people and found it hard to get along with them . Roosevelt likes people and gets along with almost anybody . Wilson liked to be alone and often was . Roosevelt abhors to be alone and seldom is . Wilson 's study was lined with hooks . Roosevelt 's study is lined with ship models . Wilson read and got most of his ideas from reading . Roosevelt talks and gets most of his ideas from conversation . Wilson was a profound student of democracy but no democrat . Roosevelt is not a profound student of democracy but he is a great democrat . Action incapacitated Wilson . Roosevelt thrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that Mr. Roosevelt is necessarily either intellectually superficial or lazy . But they do indicate that , however adequate his understanding may be , it is not a result of reflection . The President is not reflective . His mind works best when it has something concrete to work on and somebody concrete to work with . Few Presidents have seen more people than Mr. Roosevelt does . Marvin McIntyre , whose business it is to keep down the number of Presidential appointments and to shoo out of the President 's office when their time is up those who are lucky enough to get in , has as much trouble with the President himself as with the callers . The President 's inclination is to see everybody . Once they are in his office , his inclination is to keep them there indefinitely . Mac hovers round , in front of the desk and behind the desk , holding the little sheet of paper on which the day 's engagements are typed , inserting every now and then a " Mr. President " which Mr. Roosevelt understands and generally ignores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Mac has a soft spot in his heart for those who catch on early . But this pleasure and ease in meeting people are more than geniality in the President . His callers are his source books . Almost everyone who has run the long gauntlet that leads to the presidential office has something to contribute . Mr. Roosevelt , if it takes ten minutes or an hour , generally gets into the man 's mind and comes out with the contribution . He hardly ever makes notes , either during a conversation or after it . Notes are not necessary . His mind sifts , tabulates , and files , and by the end of a long day of conversations the vast amount of information and ideas which have come out of other men 's minds have been tucked securely away in Mr. Roosevelt 's . When , in his second term as Governor of New York State , Mr. Roosevelt 's presidential prospects began to rise , he turned deliberately to the business of informing himself on certain national problems with which , as a candidate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most authoritative books . He called for the most authoritative people . They gave him what he wanted to know boiled down and separated from what he did not need to know and , therefore , did not care about . This use of other people 's minds is one , probably the chief , reason why under Mr. Roosevelt the role of presidential adviser has assumed hitherto unequalled importance . Most of the members of the 1932 Brain Trust have long since found other fields of endeavor . But there will always be a Brain Trust as long as Mr. Roosevelt is President . The personnel shifts and changes . At present its chief members are Tom Corcoran and Ben Cohen . Six months hence Corcoran and Cohen may have moved on or out . But if they do a new combination is sure to move in . A Brain Trust is indispensable to Mr. Roosevelt . Its members do his mental leg-work . Unofficially they do much more than that . They see Mr. Roosevelt at those times when he is making up his mind what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him in that process . They are , moreover , young men with ideas of their own . It is inevitable , therefore , that they not only put meat on his ideas ; they exert an influence on the ideas themselves ? more influence , often , than Representatives , Senators , or Cabinet Members . The President 's mental operations not only require somebody definite to work with ; they require ? as I have said ? something definite to work on . The problems he most enjoys are those which can be reduced to a diagram or a column of figures . In conversation about abstract ideas , Mr. Roosevelt 's contribution is likely to be not an expansion of the idea but a concrete example that illustrates it . This , I think , is a reflection of his Dutch ancestry ? a very hard-headed , practical ancestry . The President has never had to work for a living . But he was never an extravagant son of the idle rich ? partly , I suppose , because his family was not that rich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He is money-conscious and he likes account books . He is never quite so completely absorbed as when he sits down with Danny Bell , Director of the Budget , gets out half a dozen well-sharpened pencils and some of his penny-a-pad scratch paper and figures out for himself how the government 's income and out-go stand . Next to the Navy , the Department in the government that is closest to his heart is the Treasury . The struggle for economy and a balanced budget which is certain to characterize his second Administration will be fought out between himself and his Congressional leaders . But back of that there will be another , more important struggle within himself , between the frugal Dutchman who believes in balanced budgets and the New Deal statesman who has promised more than can be easily achieved within a balanced budget . In such a struggle the odds are on the Dutchman . In fact , I doubt if any of his reform legislation would give him as much satisfaction as the actual balancing of the budget . In personal matters he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a free spender . Mrs. Roosevelt ? startled one day to receive a long-distance telephone call from him ? spoke of " my rather careful husband " and decided , immediately , that something extraordinarily important had happened . The President had called from Buenos Aires to tell her of the death of Gus Gennerich , his personal aide . The President 's first question about a project is likely to be " will it pay ? " or , even more likely , " how much will it pay ? " He is reputed to be hostile to business . But he has a great deal of pride in his own business transactions , and I am inclined to believe that one of his unrealized ambitions is to be a successful business man . When , therefore , the problem at hand is a concrete one the President masters it . I have seen him frequently , at press conferences , jump from one specific question about the government to the next with exactly the facts and information necessary to constitute the right answers . Occasionally ? when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly intricate matters ? he calls in experts . He generally forgets that they are there . At the first press conference after the reciprocal trade treaty was signed with Canada he had a small battalion of authorities back of his desk and a great pile of data on it . He never once referred to either . For an hour he leaned back in his chair and ? although the treaty covered several hundred items of trade between the two countries ? gave out from memory all the facts that the newspapers asked for . This preference for and absorption with what is concrete and definite are highly useful in the ordinary business of running the government of the United States . But these have been more than ordinary times and Mr. Roosevelt has not been an ordinary President . He has done more than manage the business and run the government of the United States . deleted material vice ; but in a tight spot he is apt to act on his hunches . He has found that it pays to play them . It would be incorrect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they are certainly a very useful supplement to his understanding , particularly when he is dealing with issues which are somewhat unformed and indefinite . His hunches , in turn , are backed by an almost equally uncanny knowledge of the state of the American mind at a particular time and on particular issues . He is generally right about what the American people will take and when and how much they will take of it . There is nothing in his experience to explain this understanding . Dutchess County is no more typically American than Surrey or Kent . His ancestral home at Hyde Park is baronial in the best English tradition . Groton and Harvard and summers abroad are not the route to Main Street . His travels in the United States have not been knock-around trips , but usually as a candidate or as President . Such traveling is about as good an introduction to the life and thought of the people of the nation as a longtime residence in Washington , D. C. Moreover , the men who have been closest to him are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hudson River . Jim Farley , for all his now somewhat over-emphasized rural boyhood and his frequent excursions into the hinterland , will always be a New Yorker . Ray Moley , Rex Tug-well , Adolph Berle , Sam Rosenman , Tom Corcoran are all Eastern , if not by birth , certainly by transplanting and outlook . Yet despite his own background and the provincialism of his intimates , the President seldom goes wrong in his forecast of popular reactions . He is sensitive to the public as some people are sensitive to the weather . And it is not merely a general survey either . He can " break down " public opinion section by section . No spokesman for the Middle West , for example , can tell him much about the psychology or the way in which , under certain conditions , the inhabitants of the one-time Bible Belt will react . I have heard awestruck Congressmen , with ears flattened from having so long been kept so close to the ground , admit after a conversation with the President that he knew more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The President , therefore , not only relies on his mind . He relies on his hunches and his intuitions . He has confidence not only in his ability but in his luck . When his mind and his hunches and intuition all come out at the same point ? and when they all seem to indicate that the time for action has arrived , then he turns on the steam , mental and physical , and does something about it . It has been remarked that by waiting so long he allows conditions to approach emergency proportions and then , not having given sufficient thought to what is in the making , he is obliged to improvise . But if he continues to improvise it is because he has been very lucky with his improvisations . The thing to do has frequently turned up on his desk at about the same time with the necessity for doing it . I think , moreover , that he has a peculiar zest for emergencies . He is inclined to look back upon the first few weeks of his first Administration with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones sprouted every night . He slept little , ate less , and set a pace that made his associates wan , hollow-eyed , and groggy but left him clear-headed and invigorated . The success with which he handled that succession of crises is an indication of the quality of his mind when it is completely unlimbered and in action . If hunches and intuition help him to determine when the time for action has arrived , the need for action ? particularly if it is pressing and the time definitely limited ? stimulates his mind beyond its usual capacities . It is because of these characteristics that Mr. Roosevelt , in all probability , has postponed either getting to the bottom of the ferment he has created or making any very specific plans to control and direct it . But the question naturally arises how , if his mental operations do not habitually deal in fundamentals , he has been able , none the less , to make fundamental alterations both in the point of view of the American people and in the objectives and processes of their government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in his mind but in his emotions . III Someone once remarked that whether or not Mr. Roosevelt had a first-rate mind , there could be no doubt he had a first-rate set of emotions . That is true . He has a first-rate set of emotions , a set , moreover , which is amazingly expressive of the temper and the spirit of the times . He has never been one of the underdogs , but he has always been on the side of the underdog . A good many people still hold to the idea that his economic liberalism is evidence of his political shrewdness and not an expression of his own convictions . I think some of these people expect him , sooner or later , to drop his advocacy of reform , dissociate himself from the cause of the under-privileged , and take his stand with " his own kind " among the Bourbons of the Knickerbocker Club ? to which , by the way , he still pays dues . He may let up on reform , but if he does it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knickerbocker Club . It will be because the reforms he lets up on cost money and will indicate that the hardheadedness of the Dutchman proved more potent than the emotions of the New Dealer . He will still be for the underdog even though he is not engaged in any expensive undertakings in his behalf . That characteristic is too much , and has been too long , a part of him to be so easily got rid of . Strangely enough , his sympathies , like his hard-headedness , have their roots in his ancestry . The President is proud of his forbears . He talks about them ? interestingly and at length ? whenever the opportunity offers , and particularly when he is at Hyde Park , where some of the more notable among them look down from the walls . But he is especially proud of the fact that so many of his immediate ancestors were political nonconformists . His own father was a Lincoln Democrat . To have been a Democrat at all among the rich landowners of the Hudson Valley required a good deal of courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned even worse than to have been a New Deal Republican in 1936 . But Franklin D. Roosevelt seems to get a boyish pleasure out of being a bit perverse and to enjoy doing what it is least expected that he will do . He therefore relished the fact that he was a Democrat if for no other reason than that almost all Hyde Park was Republican and inclined to be supercilious about it . At any rate , when he went to Albany as a youthful member of the State Senate he had a nonconformist precedent to maintain . He maintained it with great enthusiasm . He jumped into the middle of the fight against the traction interests , the major fight of the day . At the outset his enthusiasm may have been stimulated by his knowledge of the shock he was giving the Hyde Park neighbors-But his wife was likewise enthusiastic about these good and slightly radical causes and she was tremendously serious about them . It was no lark with her but a crusade . While her husband was in the midst of the traction fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was making the rounds of New York City 's tenements with Frances Perkins , then an amateur social worker , getting first-hand knowledge of how the other half lived and passing on both her information and her zeal to her husband . She gave substance to his inclinations . She spurred a faith that might have flagged . In the end the plight of the dispossessed became a crusade with him as it was with her . When , therefore , the times turned ripe for that kind of gospel he had the gospel ready for the times . The forgotten man had had his attention for a good many years before it got to the attention and caught the imagination of the country . His emotions , in 1932 , were a mirror of the emotions of the American people . The things he had been trying to do for a long time in New York State were the things that they desired to have done for the nation . Mr. Roosevelt did not find out what the people wanted and offer it to them . He offered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that , as it turned out , was what they wanted . It would be a mistake to conclude that this sponsorship of the cause of America 's depressed classes is entirely emotional . His sympathies fit into an intellectual pattern which undoubtedly has deepened since 1932 until to-day it constitutes his social and economic philosophy . He hardly ever expresses it . But here and there in his speeches and , even more infrequently , in conversation he indicates that it is there . In this , as in other matters , he has not reached his conclusions from reading but rather from his contacts . It is probable that the two men who helped him most to sharpen his thinking and give it definite outline in this regard were Adolph Berle and Rexford Guy Tugwell . Both of them were members of the 1932 Brain Trust . They shared Mr. Roosevelt 's social enthusiasm . They had come to their conclusions by dint of wide reading and hard thinking . Their operations had been almost entirely in the intellectual realm . But in that realm they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound knowledge of what it was all about . Although much younger men than Mr. Roosevelt , they were able to add something to the maturity of his thought . They did not change his opinions , but they helped to strengthen the intellectual foundations under them . just what it is Mr. Roosevelt believes and what he occasionally reveals he is driving at can be briefly summarized . His liberalism , for all his sympathy for the underdog , is essentially hard-headed . He believes that liberalism is the best kind of hard-headedness . He believes in capitalism and the private profit system and shares the distaste of the best of the Conservatives for radicalism and radicals . His definition of radicalism , however , is not that of the reactionary who looks upon all change as radical . He believes that change , far from being radical , is the essence of sound Conservatism . If he were to grade the various existing dangers to the permanence of our institutions , I think he would put at the top of the list not the radicals who advocate the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in them . Mr. Roosevelt has been frequently accused of hostility toward Big Business . I think he has such a hostility not because he is against bigness , in itself , but because he is convinced that many big enterprises and perhaps most big fortunes reached their size by practices which , however honest and legal , perpetuate conditions which are unhealthy for the system and a threat to its future . The story is told of a meeting of steel executives in the President 's office , to discuss an N.R.A . code for their industry . The representative of the Bethlehem Steel Company when leaving told the President that Eugene Grace , President of the Company , had asked that his respects be paid to Mr. Roosevelt . Whereupon the President replied , " pay my respects to Gene and tell him that he will never make a million dollars a year acrain " 0 . The President 's attitude toward Big Business Men has the same convictions back of it as his attitude toward Big Business . I do not think he is against Big Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He believes that a considerable number of Big Business Men ? he would probably single out the leaders of the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers as examples ? are , to put it baldly , " dumb . " He believes that if our economic system cracks up and they lose their financial skins they will have only themselves to blame . Now , for a period the length of which no one can foretell , the massing forces at the other end of the economic scale are in a mood to settle with a compromise . That mood ? if compromises are not forthcoming ? will certainly not last . When it passes , the consequences arc likely to be disruptive , and the very men who now stand adamant against the Ncw Deal 's half-way measures will probably stampede to Washington again as they did in the spring of 1933 , pleading to be saved from results of their own failure to accept those measures and make them work . Mr. Roosevelt has always been for labor . But it is not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the average labor leader , John L. Lewis in particular , than he has for the average industrialist . He probably would say , however , that the average labor leader is several degrees smarter than the average industrialist . And he does prefer smart people . He is not for labor because he is against capital . He is for labor because he is for capital . What he has done to meet the demands of labor has been a result of the conviction that the concessions necessary to meet those demands are an investment in the safety of our institutions , just as the unwillingness of certain types of business leaders to concede anything is a threat to that safety . His confidence in democracy , like that in capitalism , is genuine . He brought back from his South American journey the conviction that this Western world represents the long-time strength and hope of democracy and that it was not too soon for the nations of these hemispheres to join together for its common defense . That idea is back of his Big Navy program . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees it , includes a certain responsibility for all of the democracies of the New World . He is undoubtedly conscious , sometimes acutely so , of the fact that the ways of democracy are often ponderous and slow and that dictatorships ? in the matter of short-cuts and quick action ? havetheir pronounced advantages . But he looks upon the developments in the United States since 1932 as proof of the fact that even the most critical and pressing problems can be worked out inside the structure both of capitalism and democracy . To give sound and solid proof of that will not only strengthen democracy and capitalism in the United States but have a heartening effect upon the faltering defenders of those institutions elsewhere and a salutary effect upon their enemies . Such proof , I think he would agree , is the most significant achievement that his Administration could produce . IV It should be pointed out , however , that this faith has never had to survive a major defeat . The democracy that he believes in has always been , up to the present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worked for , not against him . It is hard to say how his confidence in the judgment of the people would be affected if their democratic mandate rejected rather than endorsed him . This is particularly a matter of speculation in his case because of the fact that his self-confidence is something more than that of a man who has reached the heights . Mr. Roosevelt is no mystic , but there is an almost mystical quality about his self-confidence , his faith in his destiny and the more than ordinary rightness of what he undertakes to do . He would not subscribe to the doctrine that the President can do no wrong . But his belief in himself has something of that doctrine in it . That is another reason why he will probably delay consideration of the consequences of the New Deal until they arc upon him . He is too sure of the end ? not only in the rightness of what he is doing but in the certainty that he will get it done . The stars have taken counsel together and written it He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to continue to shun the alarmists . Moreover , this sell-confidence will help to explain why , as the consequences of the New Deal develop through his second four years , the third-term temptation will become continually more pressing . It would be hard , at best , to choose from among his aspiring associates a man to wear his mantle . If , however , the Roosevelt program and , with it , the Roosevelt place in history are put in jeopardy by division and revolt , then such a choice will be infinitely more difficult . For more than four years now the slogan has been repeated , in the White House executive offices as elsewhere , that " there is only one Roosevelt . " With due deference to the prospective contenders , it appears to be obvious that there will be only one Roosevelt in 1940 . He has not prepared a successor and I do not believe that he is now preparing one . More because of his personality than by deliberate intent , he has not shared the spotlight with anyone else ? not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-man show . What he started will be far from finished at the end of eight years . The issue before him , therefore , is between a precedent which , however hallowed , is nothing more than a precedent and certain momentous undertakings which in other hands than those that launched them might well lose their significance and which , if there is any popular wavering , would appear unlikely ever to reach completion save by four more years of the power and magic of his leadership . Mr. Roosevelt may never act on any such assumption ; but the fact of his unshaken and unshakeable faith in himself ? his almost mystical self-confidence ? makes it necessary to include such actions among the possibilities . His decision is likely to be determined by his appraisal of the developing aftermath of the New Deal . I said at the outset that he has created an atmosphere , released forces , and set a trend in the United States which are as much more significant than the New Deal as they threaten to be beyond its control . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some effort to control them . If by 1940 they are not controlled , then , lacking four more years in which to continue the attempt , he will face the unpleasant prospect of going out of office with the future of his objectives and his own destiny shadowed with uncertainty . Mr. Roosevelt would relish that prospect less than most men . I do not believe that there is anything messianic in his belief in himself , but I am very sure that he would no more put his mission in jeopardy by surrendering it , too soon , to other hands than he would willingly consent to go down in history as a John the Baptist for some greater leader .
