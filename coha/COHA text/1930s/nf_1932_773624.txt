The organization that was responsible for the original exposition has been continued and is now planning other undertakings in keeping with its liberal and unifying spirit . In the opinion of William R.

" The Plain Dealer encouraged this project not only in ii columns but by making the Little Theater in Cleveland Public Auditorium available to each national group for or performance and one rehearsal without cost to them . Wheni a large auditorium was required the Music Hall was engage under special arrangement . A master set of scenery adap able to almost any conceivable stage need was designed an placed at the disposal of the groups by the Plain Dealer .

Proceeds were used for some philanthropic , social , or cultural purpose in the city . At the time of each presentation the public library arranged an exhibition of the arts and crafts of the national groups represented , the objects for which were for the most part supplied by the groups , and it made accessible many books dealing with their homelands . The notable way in which each of Cleveland 's three leading daily newspapers has found a satisfactory field in which to specialize and at the same time support the programs being fostered by the others is worthy of special mention , and that each undertaking is co-ordinated with the Department of Recreation in a city-wide effort to bring about better understanding between native and foreign-born people establishes Cleveland as a unique leader in this field . THE HOMELANDS EXHIBIT AT TRENTON , NEW JERSEY The Homelands Exhibit held in the State Museum at Trenton was the first instance in which a state museum has carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months , from November 6 , 1930 to February I , 1931 . In the words of the announcement , " It was conducted with the hope of giving America a truer appreciation of the gifts of Europe to this country ; and at the same time to emphasize to foreign-born parents and their children the dignity and beauty of their native handicrafts . " The exhibit was held under the auspices of the Art Advisory Committee of the Museum , which is composed of twenty-one women representing different sections of New Jersey . The Art Committee was assisted by a School Committee which conducted school exhibits , and by a State-wide International Committee comprised of twenty men and women of foreign birth who helped with the assembling of material and with the planning of Nationality Day Programs . Valuable assistance was also given by the National Board of the Young Womens Christian Associations and the various international institutes in New Jersey . As its adviser , the Museum secured the services of Mrs. Gladys Spicer Fraser of New York , who had excellent knowledge of peasant arts and crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the various co-operating committees , advance newspaper announcements , letters sent to immigrant organizations throughout the state , and through the public schools of Trenton . An unusual feature of the undertaking was the preliminary exhibits held in the schools of Trenton previous to the general exhibit at the Museum . A letter announcing the exhibit and giving instructions for this preliminary gathering of material was sent out by the superintendent of schools to the principals throughout the city , who with the teachers were urged to give the project hearty support and to utilize it as a profitable unit of work in connection with classes in history and geography . ' The school exhibitions were held in the local schoolhouses about a month in ad- // vance of the general exhibition at the Museum , and while they were on view the Art Committee from the Museum visited them and selected the articles to be used in the general exhibition . The schools located in the districts of the foreign born in Trenton had particularly fine and comprehensive exhibits which greatly stimulated interest in the larger exposition . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dances , and plays to which the children invited their parents . Instead of displaying the folk arts and crafts in regulation cases two of the galleries at the Museum were reconstructed to represent rooms in peasant homes . On entering , the visitor was greeted by a bit of Italy . The exterior of an Italian peasant house with its bright awning , strings of peppers , rows of tomatoes , and macaroni hung out to dry furnished a fitting setting for peasant pottery and household utensils . A bedroom of Hungary showed a quaint high bed with many pillows . A kitchen of Jugoslavia with a built-in tile stove and copper cooking vessels made an appropriate background for the peasant costumes with their bright embroidery . A Polish room with raftered ceiling was arranged with Zakopane carved wood furniture ; one of Germany with furniture typical of the late Renaissance or early Baroque style of about 167o . Nearby was a section devoted to authentic peasant costumes of European countries . In the center of the hall a Slavic wayside shrine and well were constructed with a curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk handicrafts from France , Switzerland , Spain , Czechoslovakia , Ukraine , Russia , Roumania , Belgium , Sweden , Holland , and Austria . The outside of each room and alcove was decorated with a design typical of the country it represented , done under the supervision of Vilko Gecan , an artist from Jugoslavia . A feature of the exhibit was a well-worked-out publicity program . Advance newspaper announcements were sent to // different parts of the state outlining the proposed event and asking for information on any articles that might be available . These announcements were widely published so that before the exhibition took place there was a general knowledge throughout the state of New jersey of what was coming . During the entire three months ' period during which it continued , regular releases of interesting features and entertainments were sent through the Associated Press to both the English and foreign language local newspapers in New Jersey and to leading newspapers in New York City and Philadelphia . Special articles were published by local magazines ; in one a series entitled Trentonians of Foreign Birth Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Poland , Scotland , Spain , and Sweden . The exhibition was open from morning until evening and was visited by 46,607 persons . A total of 117 classes of school children made special appointments to study it under the guidance of the Museum staff , and ten clubs and other adult organizations held regular or occasional meetings at the Museum during which talks were given on the arts and crafts displayed there . In summing up the results of the Homelands Exhibit Mrs. Kathryn B. Greywacz , curator of the State Museum , who organized and directed the exhibit , has stated that besides stimulating interest in and creating a love for the arts and crafts of Europe among native citizens the foreign born have taken a keener interest in all the activities of the Museum as well as in civic programs . In May following the exhibit , during music week , in answer to a request by the mayor of Trenton , a series of nationality programs was given as a part of the exercises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 193 ! a considerable number of exhibits were entered by immigrants who had never before taken part . The whole undertaking has put the State Museum of New Jersey in a position - o6 OTHER EVENTS EXPRESSING APPRECIATION to render valuable help to any community which n to promote a Homelands Exhibit . FOLK FESTIVALS OF THE HOMELANDS , NEW The Folk Festival Council of New York City ? programs at the Guild Theatre early in 1932 , one uary 31 and the other on February 7 . The number c participating was so large that it was not possible to entertainment in one evening . The Council ' had been formed upon the invitation Foreign Language Information Service in 1931 . Festival Council , " its announcement to the pub " is composed of people of twenty-four different nati or ethnic groups , and its purposes are to give the New York an opportunity to enjoy the contribution foreign-born groups to the folk-arts , and to keep t1 alive as a vital part of our community life by F foreign-born people themselves with fine and dignific tunities for artistic expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h plans of the Council which , it is announced , will c work into 1936 . Another was an exhibition of in handicrafts held more or less continuously from Nov // 1931 to March 1 , 1932 , in the offices of the Foreign Language Information Service at 222 Fourth Avenue , New York City . The programs were built around the cycle of the seasons and consisted mainly of traditional songs , dances , and picturesque incidents related to the changing seasons . The dances were given in the colorful native costumes of the homelands and were accompanied by the simple music characteristic of rural life . Each program was opened with a prologue spoken by Te Ata , a Chickasaw Indian maiden wearing her ceremonial costume , which contained an address written in 1907 by Hiamovi , high chief of the Cheyennes and the Dakotas , to the great chief at Washington . The Great Mystery , Hiamovi said , had meant that one day his country should be peopled by men of every color . ' On January 31 , 1932 the groups taking part and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a springtime interlude entitled Ascension Day Is Here ; the Hawaiians , a May Day celebration in Hawaii , Lei Day ; the English , ceremonial and country dances including the Horn Dance , Garland Dance , Newcastle , and Sellenger 's Round ; the Spanish , a group of Spanish dances , solos and choruses ; the Norwegians , the Feast of Saint John , Jonsok ; the Polish , harvest festival in Poland , Dozynki ; the Irish , an ancient harvest festival , Samhain ; the Czechs , a harvest festival , Obzinky ; the Bulgarians , the opening of a fall festival , the Call of the Flute ; the Swedes , the crowning festival of the year , the Feast of Saint Lucia . The groups and the names of some of the offerings on the program of February 7 , 1932 , were : The Lithuanians , a May festival entitled Geguzine ; the Hungarians , a scene from a spring festival and Magyar dances ; the Finns , dances of Finland by Imatra ; the Esthonians , a festival of . Io8 OTHER EVENTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical fiesta ; the Jugoslays , a village scene in front of a church , with dances and tambouritza orchestra ; the Slovaks , Market Day ; the Germans , Christmas Eve in Germany ; the Danes , a Shrove-tide festival ; and the Ukrainians a festival with folk dances . Shortly after the entertainments a party was held at Vasa Hall , New York City , to which all who participated in the two programs were invited . Here those who had separately entertained the public with their music , dances , singing , and games were given an opportunity to meet one another socially . This gathering was an early realization of the hopes which the sponsors had long had in mind . Nearly five hundred attended and the whole evening was devoted to folk dancing , as many as four hundred joining in the Kolo , the Jugoslav round dance , and dances from the other homelands . It achieved exactly the social integration desired , and within a few days after the party arrangements had been made by which groups of dancers from several countries had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and music . As a direct result of the festival many of the groups that took part have been asked to give their programs in different parts of New York City and at points in nearby counties . CANADIAN FOLKSONG AND HANDICRAFT FESTIVALS The program which Canada is working out in the effort to conserve and encourage the arts , crafts , and skills of the French-Canadians and her more recent citizens of foreign birth , happily called " New Canadians , " has in it much that is worthy of emulation for our country . This program , which , taken in its entirety , may well be called a movement to emphasize the contributions of all the members of Canada 's great family , has brought both public and private forces into co-operation and has given the particular celebrations much more than local significance . It falls naturally into two // distinct undertakings widely separated geographically : first , the annual Folksong and Handicraft Festival held in Quebec ; second , the series of New Canadian Folksong and Handicraft Festivals held in Winnipeg , Regina , and other northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominion life other than that of the immigrant . For instance , in a festival given at Banff in July , 1928 , which continued seven days , the Indians of the Canadian Rockies with their decorated tipis and handicrafts as a background for their ceremonial songs and dances , were the center of interest . There was also a Highland Gathering and Scottish Music Festival at Banff , and later a Sea Music Festival was held at Vancouver in which the program consisted of solos , chorals , chanties sung by old sailors of Vancouver and those northern Pacific waters , and instrumental interpretations of the sea . In all of these the same purpose and inspiration dominated the undertaking as in other instances , namely , to lift out , sometimes from obscurity and almost disdain , those cultural values which are so great a part of Canada 's heritage . The Folksong and Handicraft Festival held at Quebec was in a sense the beginning of the co-operative movement which has extended throughout the Dominion . It is therefore interesting to know how this festival originated . The Chateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Railway , was partly burned in 1923 and it was widely prophesied that it would never be rebuilt . The railway did rebuild it and invited a number of newspaper men from the Dominion and the States to be present at its reopening . In seeking entertainment for their guests , John Murray Gibbon , general publicity agent for the Canadian Pacific , requested one of his French-Canadian friends to ask some of the inhabitants about Quebec to sing their folksongs and play their music . This the local musicians were unwilling to do because they said the English did not understand French and therefore would not care for their songs ; they IIO OTHER EVENTS EXPRESSING APPRECIATION did not wish to entertain an unsympathetic audience . When Mr. Gibbon proposed to print translations of the songs they consented to make the attempt . The translations of these charming old roundelays and ballads in their hands , the visitors were delighted with the entertainment . Out of this celebration grew the first festival held in 1927 , and since so much folk music is connected with the daily work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicrafts were added as a part of the program . It was felt that these festivals offered a real opportunity to create a better understanding between the French and English-speaking people of the Dominion and at the same time to bring to Quebec , at a season of the year when there was little travel , people who would not otherwise come . Beginning with the second year , in addition to the Canadian Pacific Railway , the National Museum , the National Gallery , and the Public Archives of Canada acted as sponsors . When the audiences for the musical programs outgrew the limits of the hotel they were transferred to an auditorium . The exhibits consist for the most part of examples of handwork from the French-Canadians living in and adjoining the Province of Quebec . But other provinces , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Cape Breton , and even faraway Labrador , sent their offerings of blankets , carpets , socks , gloves , caps , sashes , baskets , carved bone and walrus ivory , handwrought metal and wooden vessels , and other objects made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in villages . In addition to the articles shown craftsmen were at work on many of the things represented . The very clothes they were wearing became an object lesson as they often were made of the wool from the backs of their own sheep and each process ? shearing , carding , spinning , weaving ? had been carried on in their own homes . Wool and flax were shown in their natural states , and to see women spinning yarn and thread on the same kind of wheels that the French peasant III IMMIGRANT GIFTS TO AMERICAN LIFE had used for centuries in Normandy and other parts of France was to return in spirit to the life of the seventeenth century . Indeed , in many parts of the French and Maritime Provinces , industry and agriculture are still as primitive as in those faraway ages . The true representation of what goes on day by day and year by year throughout some of the rural districts was extremely educational . To these homely scenes was added the charm of men and women and children singing at their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spinning wheel or the sharp rhythmic beat of the shuttle in the loom . Throughout the corridors of the quaint hotel were the sounds of fiddles , of clogging , of the singing of the old folksongs , as dear to the hearts of the people now as to the early immigrants when the country was known as New France . Every evening there was a concert of peasant songs and choruses and sometimes one of more sophisticated or classic music . Generous prizes are now offered for the development of old musical themes or of original compositions in harmony with them . The result is a genuine , widespread interest in their preservation . Dr. Marius Barbeau of the Department of Ethnology of the Ottawa Museum has collected and preserved over six thousand of these chansons . It was also through his researches that three wood carvers of ecclesiastical subjects were discovered . These craftsmen who took part in the handicraft exhibition for the first time in 1928 , represent a school that was founded in the Province of Quebec about 1700 and has continued without a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival at Quebec was the series known as the New Canadian Folksong and Handicraft Festivals to which reference has already been made , organized , installed , and interpreted by the Canadian Handicraft Guild . This organization was incorporated in I906 to preserve and promote the cottage industries of Canada and // to " encourage and assimilate the varied beautiful crafts which newcomers were bringing in from countries worldfamed for a proficiency in the manual arts . " 1 It aids immigrants during the trying early days of their settlement in a new country by providing them with a market for good handiwork , and through exhibitions of the products of their skill increases contentment in their homes . It also sends to immigrant families teachers and supervisors to keep up the standard of excellence . Of these folksong festivals , a description of the one held at Winnipeg in I928 , the first for which the Canadian Handicraft Guild took full responsibility , will give some idea of others conducted in the northwestern part of the country . Among the objects shown were weavings done on hand-looms , which included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needlework ; lace , both needle and bobbin ; crocheting , knitting ; sewing , dyeing ; rugs and carpets , hooked , braided , and woven ; bead , leather , and metal work ; wood carving and joining ; artificial flowers ; costume dolls , and other toys . Prizes were awarded for this work done largely in their homes by New Canadian girls and women from the following thirteen European countries : Denmark , Germany , Hungary , Iceland , Italy , Jugoslavia , Norway , Poland , Roumania , Russia , Serbia , Sweden , and Ukraine . The musical program at the Winnipeg Festival was organized by the Music Department of the Canadian Pacific Railway , and continued throughout the afternoons and evenings of the three days ' celebration . The afternoon entertainments were given in the ballroom of the Royal Alexander Hotel , the evening ones at the Walker Theater . All performances drew capacity audiences . It is not possible to print in full the interesting programs , but such a variety had never IMMIGRANT GIFTS TO AMERICAN LIFE been heard in Canada before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers : The Bellman Quartette , whose members were born in Sweden , gave selections in their native tongue and folk dances ; the Icelandic Chorus , fourteen short folksongs ; the Norwegian Folk Dancers , in native costumes , and the Norwegian Glee Club gave dances and songs ; the Danish-born population , folksongs , dances , and by request the Danish National Anthem ; Ukraine , solos , ballets , choruses , sung in both Ukrainian and English ; Germany , male choruses by the Mennonite Choir of Niverville and Folksongs and Dances by the Black Forest Singers and Dancers from the Schwarzwald ; Holland , sixteenth century Dutch music , by the members of the Double Quartette in costumes of the period ; Italy , accordion players who specialized in national airs and danced the Tarantella ; the Don Cossacks sang and played the balalaika , mandolina , and guitarre , while Roumania , Czechoslovakia , Poland , Hungary , and Jugoslavia were well represented by quartettes , choruses , instrumentalists , and folk dancers . The final performance included at least one number from each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the singing of " 0 Canada " and " God Save the King " by a massed chorus of two hundred people , most of whom were natives of other homelands . The printed programs of these entertainments , supplied to the audience without charge , contained the names of all who took part with pictures of many of them in their native dress , and translations of all songs . The programs also contained short articles describing the music , dancing , and costumes of the old homelands of these New Canadians . ' // RESOURCES FOR FUTURE EXHIBITIONS THE Arts and Crafts of the Homelands Exhibitions and also most of the other events described in the preceding chapters have had to do mainly with old world backgrounds . This chapter will deal not with these but rather with some contributions made to the arts and crafts of the new world by our immigrant citizens and the ways in which their work has contributed to the cultural life of our country . At the Buffalo exhibition a visitor who had made the rounds of the display said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea of the things in which the immigrant is interested , but it is old world stuff ; what I want to know is , do any of these people do anything in these directions after they come here ? " The question was a very pertinent one and it probably reflected the thoughts of other visitors less articulate in recording their reactions . This chapter will partly answer that question . It is , however , fair to say that even in the Buffalo exhibition there was considerable evidence of the carrying over of the arts and crafts from the old world into the new . There were foreignborn craftsmen at work ; there were examples of painting , sculpture , and handicrafts which had been done by American citizens born in other lands . There were also the immigrant men and women and children who took part in the entertainment ? the music makers , the dancers , the actors , the singers of folksongs ? all definitely contributing to the beauty and gaiety of the life of the city . However , in the main the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This chapter , therefore , in addition to answering the ques-1-5 IMMIGRANT GIFTS TO AMERICAN LIFE tion asked by the visitor at Buffalo will suggest to those contemplating similar exhibitions an important source of new and significant material . Much of it is interesting because of intrinsic worth , but when regarded also as a part of the immigrant 's gift to his adopted country it becomes doubly so . The extent of such material can only be suggested here , but any person seriously concerned can with a little effort find an abundance of it . METHOD OF SELECTION Before referring to any of the artists and craftsmen who have been chosen to illustrate the great mine of immigrant skills which lies close at hand for those who care to explore it , the method of selection that has been roughly followed might be stated . Each person had to meet the obvious requirement of having been born in another land and of having become a citizen of our own . In one or two instances citizenship has not been completed but is in process . The individuals mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another given special pleasure to the writer . No two persons selecting artists and craftsmen from the long list available would choose the same . For those listed here no claim of superiority over a group which anyone else might choose is held . However , there are good and sufficient reasons for anyone 's including them . Many have reputations extending far beyond the shores of their adopted country ; others have had their work purchased by leading art museums and galleries , or have won awards in important national competitions ; still others have made outstanding contributions either through the application of their old world patterns or motifs to a new world need , or through teaching . Here they have rendered a distinctive social service by bringing into the lives of native-born Americans the influence of fine old traditions and craftsmanship . // To summarize , no attempt has been made to choose only the greatest or the most successful , but rather to choose a varied group of men and women from many lands , each of whom has bestowed a distinct gift . Selections have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture , painting , graphic arts , and the handicrafts . These will give a wide variety of subjects suitable for exhibition either through the display of the objects or of good photographs of them . Often one will find in the lives of the artists themselves many a stirring story of human interest that is in itself an inspiration . FOREIGN-BORN SCULPTORS Sculpture is not a popular art in this country , but there are unmistakable signs of its becoming so . As a nation we already have to our credit some fine examples , which discriminating observers have given high rank . In this development some of our foreign-born citizens have played an important part . Among them we choose men from Ireland , Canada , England , Poland , France , Germany , Austria , Norway , Sweden , Roumania , Czechoslovakia , and Italy . In considering American sculptors without regard to their place of birth but solely because of the quality of their work , one name stands out conspicuously , that of Augustus SaintGaudens . Of him it has been said , " No sculptor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . " Of these perhaps the most universally known is the standing full-sized figure of Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln Park , Chicago . When our people decided to present a statue of the great emancipator to the people of England to be set up in a public square in London , it was a bronze replica of this Lincoln which they chose . Many recalling the work of Augustus Saint-Gaudens would signalize the Memorial to Colonel Robert Gould Shaw leading his colored troops to battle erected at the corner of Boston Common just opposite the State House ; or the Ii7 IMMIGRANT GIFTS TO AMERICAN LIFE splendid equestrian statue of General Sherman at the Fifth Avenue entrance to Central Park , New York City ; or that symbolical but mysterious figure carved from granite , the Adams Monument , in Rock Creek Cemetery at Washington , D. C. , of which Royal Cortissoz has said , " It is the finest thing of its kind produced by an American sculptor , and an achievement which modern Europe has not surpassed . " These and other works of Saint-Gaudens are pictured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art museum in this country with a department of sculpture but contains some examples from his hands . In many schoolrooms throughout the land are reproductions of his statues and reliefs . The most adequate record of his life and achievements , where are permanently installed notable examples of his work , is , however , the Saint-Gaudens Memorial at Cornish , New Hampshire , his home and studio for many years . Augustus Saint-Gaudens came to America with his parents from Ireland in 1848 , bringing into the new world the blood strains of two homelands . His father , Bernard SaintGaudens , a cobbler by trade , was born in the little village of Aspet at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains in France . In search of work , he went to Ireland and in the shop where he found it he also found the girl of his choice , Mary McGuiness . They married and after a few years decided to come to America . The struggle of this immigrant family to get a foothold in the United States is the typical story of countless others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have cast their lots without reservation in the new . Mute evidence of the efforts of these French-Irish parents to give their children better opportunities than they had enjoyed is the little pair of handmade shoes in the Museum at Cornish , New Hampshire , shaped by the young mother who continued , after her arrival in America , to make and mend shoes in her home as // she cared for the children while the father went out in search of any honest work he might find . Endowed by both parents with a love of the beautiful and with a sterling character , Augustus at thirteen decided that he wanted to be an artist . As the first step he was apprenticed to a New York cameo cutter by day and at night attended Cooper Union . The story of this immigrant boy 's progress as a sculptor , from his first statue , Hiawatha ? the American Indian ? to a permanent and high place among the great sculptors of his day should be of equal inspiration to both native and foreign born . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of immigrants who have found here a new land of opportunity where , nevertheless , it has taken great courage and industry to make the most of them . In thinking of our sculptors who have interpreted the American scene and the American spirit , our minds turn instinctively toward one who as a young man worked with the great Saint-Gaudens , one who came to the United States an immigrant boy from Canada , A. Phimister Proctor . Mr. Proctor chiseled The Buckaroo and the Indian Chief for the Civic Center , at Denver , Colorado ; The Circuit Rider , an imperishable record of a fine American type , the Christian minister of frontier days , for the State House grounds in Salem , Oregon ; and the equestrian statue of Roosevelt , The Rough Rider , at Portland , Oregon . As a sculptor of animals he is known for the famous Tigers flanking Nassau Hall , Princeton , New Jersey . These are a few of the many works to Mr. Proctor 's credit throughout the country . The others must be passed over here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important achievement , The Pioneer Mother , a heroic bronze in Kansas City , Missouri . This is a massed group of two horses and three human figures . Seated on the lead horse is the beautifully sculptured form of a young woman with her baby resting in her // arms , her face looking intently toward the West . On the right side of the horse which the mother rides walks the young father . His gaze is straight ahead , but he is ever alert to danger from any side as he guards his precious possessions and leads his horses along the trail . The mention of The Pioneer Mother brings to mind another statue of a similar name , although very different in type , The Pioneer Woman by Bryant Baker , a native of England , given to Ponca City , Oklahoma , by E. W. Marland . This is a standing figure , or to be more precise , a walking figure , of a pioneer woman and her small son . The commission was awarded to Mr. Baker as the result of a spirited country-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection having been made not by the customary jury but by a vote of the people who saw the statue . Mr. Baker has done a number of American subjects , some monuments and some portrait studies . Two of these latter especially well known are that of his friend , the poet , James Whitcomb Riley , and that of Woodrow Wilson . Many consider Mr. Baker 's sculpture portrait of the late president the best that has been done of him . An interpreter of the newer America , the land of industry , is Max Kalish of Cleveland , Ohio , who depicts with fine feeling the laborer in mine and mill and factory , of which there are millions in our country and to whom scant attention has yet been given by those working in the plastic arts . The dynamic figures of Mr. Kalish are both human and moving , not only because he is a skilled artist and craftsman but because he has been one of his own subjects , having come to America an immigrant boy from Poland and having worked with his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania and Ohio . He has experienced the life he interprets and idealizes . His figure of The Oiler , a tall strong American railroader in overalls and worker 's cap , carrying in his hands a red copper oil can with a long curved- // at-the-end spout to reach every part of the great locomotive , is a faithful picture of a very familiar person in American railroad life . Other figures of men in industry which will recall in spirit and execution the great Belgian sculptor , Constantin Meunier , are Toil 's End , The Fireman , and The Laborer at Rest . Only in subject and skill of presentation , however , does the comparison hold , for Mr. Kalish distinctly portrays the American workman . Philip Martiny was born in Alsace when that country was a part of the French republic before the Franco-Prussian War . He came to America when he was twenty years of age and fell in with Augustus Saint-Gaudens , with whom he spent five happy years assisting him with some of his famous works . He also executed many commissions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sailors ' Monument in front of the City Hall in Jersey City , for the design of which he was awarded first prize in a contest in which sculptors from forty-three states competed . Mr. Martiny distinguished himself in connection with the sculpture of several international expositions held in the United States , particularly on buildings calling for a skill and facility in decoration not common with sculptors of the western world . In his History of American Sculpture , Lorado Taft writes of Mr. Martiny : " At his best he of all our sculptors shows the most highly developed decorative sense and the most astounding skill in expression . He brings us what we as a nation lack , the gift which France possesses in such abundance . " Among Mr. Martiny 's most recent works are some fine memorials to the soldiers of the World War . 1 le died in 1927 , the most outstanding sculptor to come to us from France . American sculpture has sometimes been criticized on the ground that it is not often found related to the mother art of architecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is pertinent here to refer to the work of one // who views his art not as sculpture per se , but as architecture conceived in sculptural form . This man is Lee Lawrie , who was born in Germany , and who came to the United States in 1879 with his widowed mother , who later married an American citizen . Under the law both mother and child became citizens . " If , " someone has written , " we had no other examples of sculpture related to architecture the work of Lee Lawrie would be sufficient to guide aright the young sculptors of our country who are certain to follow his lead and make the structure elements of a building flower into decorations of honesty and beauty rather than to mark merely the addition of another ornament . " Among the well-known works of Mr. Lawrie are the decorations in the Harkness Memorial at Yale University , done in collaboration with James Gamble Rogers , the architect ; the sculpture in Saint Thomas ' Church , New York City , done in collaboration with Bertram Goodhue ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new State Capitol at Lincoln , Nebraska , also in collaboration with Mr. Goodhue . All three of these are remarkable examples of consistent and beautiful treatment . From Austria came one who through both his own work and as director of important sculptural projects rose to be one of the greatest influences in the field of sculpture our country has known . Karl Bitter , a native of Vienna , at the age of twenty won his first recognition in America in a competition for the design of the bronze doors in Trinity Church , New York City , a contest in which a number of leading American sculptors had entered . He had not been long in this country and it was while yet he was struggling to learn the language and get a foothold in the new land that this important award came to him , perhaps the least known of any of the contestants . At once it placed him in a favorable position with the architects of the great city , with several of whom he was soon collaborating in important commissions . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist and his marked ability to work with others led to the selection of Mr. Bitter to direct the sculptural work at the PanAmerican Exposition held in Buffalo in Igor . Here he had an opportunity to show his gifts as sculptor and a coordinator of sculptors . Those who attended the Buffalo Exposition will remember the Standard Bearers , the monumental equestrian figures at the entrance to the great fair . These were Mr. Bitter 's own contribution . Later came the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904 , where he was chosen director of sculpture , and still later at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition held at San Francisco in 1913 , where he held the same position . In the opinion of many the sculpture in connection with the Panama-Pacific Exposition was the finest which the new world had yet seen . It proved to be an enormous project employing thirty-five American sculptors and over a hundred assistants who were kept busy for more than a year . Karl Bitter not only demonstrated again his rare ability as a director and co-ordinator of artists and craftsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole plan gave the world an exhibition of sculpture related to architecture and gardens which up to the time had had no counterpart . In 1915 just as relief was coming from the strain and responsibility of this great task , Mr. Bitter was run down by an automobile in New York City and his useful and brilliant life ended . But his work at this marvelous exposition had flowered beautifully . In his busy years since he as a young man of twenty had won the Trinity Church award for the bronze doors , he had become an active and honored citizen , and one of the most effective interpreters of American life in sculpture that our country has known . Among his finest monuments and memorials are the Jefferson Monument at the University of Virginia ; the Villard Memorial in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery , Westchester County , // New York ; and the Carl Schurz Monument , Carl Schurz Park , New York City . It would be interesting to make a study of the sculpture of any great exposition held on this continent to see how many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to , 000 visitors at the San Francisco Fair gave thought to this question . However , among the images which nearly every visitor who spent even a day in the beautiful courts formed by the exposition buildings must have carried away in memory were the two winged figures , Rising Sun and Descending Night , in the Court of the Universe . Both were of exceptional grace and beauty ; Rising Sun , gently ascending from the sphere on which it was poised nine hundred feet above the court , and Descending Night , hovering over another sphere at the opposite end of the court . These were the work of Adolph Weinman , a native of Germany . Nor did it probably occur to most visitors at the exposition who saw these figures that they had often seen examples of Mr. Weinman 's work in another form without knowing them to be his . Mr. Weinman is one of the chief medalists of our country , and he was chosen by the government to design two of our silver coins , the dime and the half-dollar piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless a bar is run through the illustrations , which would mar the design , but why use a substitute when the original is available ? Let the reader consult his own examples of Mr. Weinman 's taste and skill . He designed the half-dollar in 1893 and the dime in 1916 . It is needless to say that these popular medals are more beautiful when bright and clean . Let us hope that such dimes as Mr. Rockefeller has the reputation of sometimes giving away are at least shining examples of Mr. Weinman 's work . In speaking of coins it will not be amiss to refer here to a few others that have been designed by American sculptors // of foreign birth . A coin not commonly seen in circulation in recent years , except in western states , the American silver dollar , was designed by Anthony de Francisci , who came to America from Italy . All silver dollars minted in 1915 and up to the date of this volume , 1932 , were designed by him . For the more prosperous collectors who go in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were designed in 1907 by Augustus Saint-Gaudens . Both are good , but the twenty-dollar piece is particularly acceptable . It so happens that another coin of great beauty with which most of us are more familiar than with the interesting gold pieces was made by one of our immigrant sculptors . When in 1909 the government decided to seek a new design for our smallest piece of money , the one-cent piece , it turned to one of our most outstanding medalists , Victor Brenner , who came to us a poor boy from Russia , and he gave us the Lincoln penny . Among the many examples of his work as a medalist this one-cent piece will always hold a high place and it is to be hoped that it will long remain the official design for our only copper coin . Although it is not permissible in such exhibitions as we are discussing to exhibit photographs of one of these coins , there is no reason why the coins themselves should not be shown as examples of the work of immigrant sculptors . Sometimes an artist working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the designs and technique of his native land . Thus Trygve Hammer , although he came to the United States when a boy and most of his education was acquired here , has often utilized in his sculpture and in his decorative painting the designs and motifs of his homeland , Norway . An interesting example of these motifs may he seen in the old Savarin dining room in the Pershing Square Building , New York City , where many of the wall decorations were done in collaboration with a Danish born artist , Olaf Olesen , who has developed a very attractive and prac- // tical method of using cement for mural painting . In his decorations Mr. Hammer used Norse designs even in the radiator coverings , ventilators , and other articles of utility . Mr. Hammer was the architect for his own home on Long Island , New York , in which he designed and carved the woodwork and had his own motifs carried out in the textiles and other furnishings . However , more accessible expressions of his interior work are to be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45th Street , New York City . In such exhibitions as we are considering an educational note of much interest can be added , as has already been suggested , if some of the artists ' experiences , the obstacles they overcame , be revealed . Not stories of the artistic temperament striving to find expression , with which many people can not associate themselves , but the prosaic things of everyday life which the poor must overcome in the quest for that something ahead . For instance , there is the story of David Edstrom , born to be a farmer boy in the valley of Woe , Sweden , in the heart of the forests of Smaland . Unable to make even the meager living which the country folk in that district must have , his farmer parents , when David was seven , emigrated to America and settled in Iowa . The soil was good in that state and the family made it yield a fair return . David lived there until he was twenty-one . But there was not much in the community to encourage him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left home determined to become an artist , and he found his first work in a meat-packing house in Chicago . It was hard , disagreeable work , but he saw more than some boys would have seen in it . He saw the brawny muscles of the men handling the meat and felt the urge to draw them . To learn to do this and to model he came to New York via a box car . But once there , he decided that his native Sweden would be his best teacher . He stoked his way over . There he studied and // worked and exhibited and finally established a reputation in Europe by making portraits in sculpture of important persons including the Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden . Returning to America , his chosen home , he made other notable portraits and added to these symbolic pieces in which he found his greatest interest , for he had come to think of life in symbols . Combining realism and symbolism , he did a memorial of great beauty to the Canadian Soldiers of the World War at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one upon which he has for several years been engaged is Man Triumphant , carved in heroic size . " This , " he says , " is what I am living for . If I can make the thing happen in marble , it may help men and women to make it happen in their lives . " The work of George Julian Zolnay has for so long been identified with the American scene that few of us probably think of him as having been born and reared to young manhood in Roumania . Mr. Zolnay has designed and built monuments and memorials in several sections of our country . He had charge of the sculpture of the art department at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 , and his monument to Pierre Laclede Liguest , founder of that city , is one of its proud possessions . Perhaps equally well known locally , though of a different interest , are the great lions at the entrance gates of University City , Missouri . In New Bedford , Massachusetts , stands his stone group commemorating the whaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England town . This monument marks an epoch in American life which gathers significance and romance with the passing of the years . But it is in the southern states that we shall find what is perhaps Mr. Zolnay 's most distinct and unique gift to this country of his adoption , his interpretation in sculpture of the life and spirit of the Old South . In Nashville , Tennessee , is the memorial to the Private Confederate Soldier , and in St. // Louis the Confederate Memorial , The Call to Arms ; while in Richmond , Virginia , holding high places in the hearts of countless southerners are the Jefferson Davis and the Winnie Davis monuments . Mr. Zolnay has recently completed a remarkable memorial to Woodrow Wilson for Roumania . In one of the most important art schools of our country , the Art Institute of Chicago , the Director of Sculpture , Albin Polasek , is a native of Czechoslovakia . There are in the high schools of our country several outstanding teachers of foreign birth , but Mr. Polasek combines with his ability as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage , great originality and skill as a sculptor . In addition Mr. Polasek has fine feeling for symbolism . One of his notable American portraits is the life-size statue of Theodore Thomas , the first to bring symphonic music to the people of our country . Incidentally Theodore Thomas was an immigrant from Germany . We close this limited list by choosing from Italy not a single sculptor but a family of sculptors , the Piccirillis , whose work is both outstanding and unique . There are six brothers : Zetulio , Furio , Attilio , Orazio , Masonello , and Ferruccio , all born in Italy , all skilled sculptors , and all American citizens . These brothers and one sister came with their parents to America from their native city , Massa , Italy , just off the Mediterranean coast in the center of the Carrara marble industry . In the opinion of many architects and sculptors this family knows more about marble in the quarry and in the monument than any other group of men in our country . Probably their greatest contribution to the advancement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size the designs made by other artists . We mention here but one of these monuments , the great statue of Lincoln by Daniel Chester such confidence had Mr. French in the judgment // and skill of the Piccirilli brothers that he not only entrusted them to enlarge his original study , he of course completing the work , but he left them to select the blocks of which the inspiring statue is made . They found the marble in the hills of Georgia and it was in the opinion of Attilio Piccirilli , who supervised the quarrying of the pieces used , " as good as the best Carrara and far more appropriate for the subject . " In addition to their very important tasks for other artists these brothers have themselves created the designs and done all the work on monuments and memorials of the highest order . Perhaps the best known of these is the Memorial to the battleship Maine which was blown up in Havana Harbor in 1898 , erected in Central Park , New York City . It was designed by Attilio and built entirely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have not space here to refer . However , one statue by Attilio , the oldest brother , is so fine and in a sense so well represents them all , that brief mention should be made of it . This is his memorial to his mother , a marble statue in Woodlawn Cemetery , New York City . No son has ever paid a more beautiful tribute to his mother . It seems more than the contribution of an Italian immigrant to America . It is Italian , there is no mistake about that . Nor could it have been made without America ; both countries determined the life of this mother and her six sons . But its sublime note of universality lifts it above place and race and time ; it is a gift to the world from Italy through America . FOREIGN-BORN PAINTERS In referring to painters of foreign birth we have selected artists from England , Germany , Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Iceland , Italy , Holland , Belgium , Armenia , and Russia . It seems natural to begin our list with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America from Lancashire , England , where he was born in 1837 . He began // painting when a boy and continued vigorously into his ninetieth year . But it is not so much his long life as the service he rendered this country by interpreting the Rocky Mountain region that sets Mr. Moran apart as a great painter . Stephen Tyng Mather , so long director of the National Park Service , said , " More than any other artist he has made us acquainted with the Great West . " Mr. Moran had for years looked forward to painting in the American Rockies . He found his opportunity when he accompanied the Hayden Expedition to the Yellowstone in 1871 . Here he made the water color sketches upon which some of his later paintings were based . This was before we had a single national park in our country , and Mr. Moran 's early sketches and later finished paintings were decided influences in arousing interest in the great scenery of the Rocky Mountain regions . The Yellowstone sketches and also the water colors made on the Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been preserved in a single collection through a purchase by George D. Pratt of New York , who presented them to the National Park Service in Washington . Among the best-known oil subjects done by Mr. Moran are the two large canvases purchased by Congress , The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , and The Grand Chasm of the Colorado , both of which now hang in the Senate Gallery of the Capitol at Washington . Other famous western mountain subjects are : The Teton Range , Yosemite Falls , Mount Moran , and Spectress of the North . Mr. Moran was not only the pioneer interpreter of our greatest mountain region but in the opinion of William H. Holmes , director of the National Gallery of Art at Washington , " He was the greatest master of landscape art America has produced . " Space does not permit us to give more attention to the paintings of the western mountain regions of America , but even the briefest reference should include the canvases of // Albert Bierstadt who came from Germany in 1831 and whose originals may be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without making any comparisons between the native and foreign-born painters of the far West , these regions have long held a great fascination for artists from Europe who have seemed to bring to the subject a special perspective and enthusiasm . Although painting in northern Europe , especially in the Scandinavian countries , is not so old as in those along the Mediterranean Sea , yet from Norway , Denmark , and Sweden have come a number of men who have found inspiring subjects in American scenes and who have added appreciably to our achievements in this field of art . Jonas Lie , who was born in Norway , has brought to his adopted country some of the traditions of his native land . This no one will doubt who studies his paintings of the Canadian woods , his fishing villages and fishing fleets off the North Atlantic Coast or any of his winter landscapes . One somehow feels that the interest which leads Mr. Lie to choose these northern subjects , often painting winter scenes from his skiis , is rooted quite definitely in the rugged earth of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and water that Mr. Lie paints with power and beauty , especially scenes of herculean works . The great oil paintings of the building of the Panama Canal will ever remain a priceless record of that mighty achievement . One of these , The Conquerors , an unparalleled portrayal of work in Culebra Cut , is now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art . The Heavenly Host is another Canal scene in which giant scoops swing high above the ground as if hanging from the clouds , carrying back and forth countless tons of earth . Of all the moving picture records that have preserved for us this stupendous performance none seems to possess that romance of reality which the paintings of Jonas Lie so faithfully present . Twelve of these // paintings have been placed in the library at West Point as a memorial to the engineer of the Panama Canal , General George Goethals . Emil Carlsen , who was born in Copenhagen , Denmark , came to this country when he was nineteen years old . The story of this young man 's struggle in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an architect and for many years seemed far from his goal , is one of mingled hardship and fascination . Between the experience gained here and in the old world , to which he returned more than once for study and work , he developed the ability to paint pictures of such beauty and such pleasure-giving qualities that he has attained a distinctive place among America 's best-known artists . Whether the subject be a landscape of beech woods or the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean , both of which he knew so well , or just a still life group of copper , gray crackle ware and onions , each reflects that personal attribute , a kind of quiet ecstasy which he feels for the subject and which , through the delicate handling of light , the exquisite feeling for texture , plus the intangible qualities of tenderness toward his subject , marks an outstanding and beautiful personal record of everything that he undertakes . Of Mr. Carlsen 's The Miraculous Draft of Fishes which hangs in the Chicago Art Institute , E. V. Lucas has said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the loneliness and mystery of water , the drama of the miracle , and the reverence of the fishermen . " And of the delicate still life , Yellow Crockery and Brass , which hangs in the Worcester Art Museum , the same author says , " You see here his loving solicitude for detail and his fine sense of arrangement . " Both the old world and the new have contributed beyond question to the qualities so cherished in the work of this American painter of Danish birth . Another Scandinavian of similar name , but born in Sweden in the Province of Smaland in 1875 , is John F. Carlson . He // came to America with his parents when eleven years old . All of Carlson 's training as a painter was in his adopted country , but when one sees his winter scenes , his beech forests , his sylvan streams and woodland pools one feels that the old northland influenced both his choice of subjects and his power to interpret them . Among his landscapes that have made his work familiar to many people throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corcoran Art Gallery , Washington , D. C. ; Woodland Repose , in the Toledo Art Museum ; Morning Mists , in the Brooks Memorial Gallery , Memphis , Tennessee ; Autumn Beeches , in the Public Art Gallery , Dallas , Texas ; Winter Dream Days , in the Art Association of Lincoln , Nebraska ; Winter Beeches , in Randolph Macon Woman 's College , Lynchburg , Virginia . Nor are his paintings his only contribution to America . He is a well-known teacher , having served as head instructor in landscape painting in the Art Students ' League of New York City , and he has established the J. F. Carlson School of Landscape Painting at Woodstock , New York . Among his writings is an important textbook on Elementary Principles of Landscape Painting . Although Iceland has not given us a large number of immigrants compared with other countries of the North , perhaps in all Io , 000 , most of them farmers in the northwestern states , she has given us a landscape painter , Emile Walters , who has the distinction of being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallery at Washington , D. C. Not his youth , however , but the quality of his work , entitles him to mention here . The landscape chosen for the National Gallery , a country scene in the region of Oyster Bay , entitled Roosevelt Haunts , is the type of picture Mr. Walters likes best to do . This still sparsely settled section of Long Island which the former president knew so well has been one of Mr. Walters ' favorite sketching grounds . Not only have his studies found their way into public and private galleries in ' 33 IMMIGRANT GIFTS TO AMERICAN LIFE our own country , but a collection has been made for his native land by the National Museum of Iceland at Reykjavik . Italy has contributed far more sculpture to America than has any other nation , but not a few of her native sons have become good painters . Albert Operti , born in Turin , Italy , in 1852 , the son of Giuseppe Operti , pianist to Victor Emmanuel II , has given us through his paintings , stirring records of exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Admiral Peary to the Arctic and brought back many paintings of that region ? The Farthest North , made in connection with Peary 's march to the Pole ; The Rescue of the Greeley Party ; The Last Franklin Search , painted for the American Geographical Society ; the large mural decorations for the American Museum of Natural History ; and many smaller paintings and sketches all carefully portray the life and scenes in the far North . From Zonnemaire , Holland , came the Dutch boy , Leonard Ochtman , with his parents in 1866 . Leonard was twelve years old when the family settled down to life in Albany , New York . Although entirely self-taught , Mr. Ochtman has taken a high place among American painters ; his canvases , particularly the sunlit snow on silent fields and woods , have great delicacy and beauty . Besides teaching himself he has taught both Mrs. Ochtman and their daughter to paint . Among his landscapes to be seen in public collections are : Winter Light , in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , New York City ; Frosty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Missouri ; Silent Morning , Gallery of Art , Columbus , Ohio ; A Gray Morning , Brooklyn Museum ; Summer Morning , Butler Art Institute , Youngstown , Ohio ; December , Museum of Art , Fort Worth , Texas . Undoubtedly the largest number of eminent painters of foreign birth from any one country have come to us from Germany . One thinks at once of William Ritschel , Carl Rungius , F. Winold Reiss , Joseph Lauber , William Wendt , // Gustav Wiegand , Karl Buehr , Joseph C. and Frank Leyendecker , and others , all doing with marked results different types of work . For the purpose of this chapter William Ritschel has been chosen . Mr. Ritschel has come to be one of America 's leading painters of the sea . Even before he was a painter he was a sailor and when he paints the ocean he paints not only what he sees but what he feels . Mr. Ritschel was born in Nuremberg in 1864 and came to America when he was thirty-one years old . His canvases of the California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is through them that he is perhaps best known . Among these are : Rocks and Breakers , in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts , Philadelphia ; Fog and Breakers , in the Detroit Art Club , Detroit , Michigan ; Rockbound Coast , in the City Art Museum of St. Louis , Missouri ; Carmel by the Sea , in the Los Angeles Art Museum , California . A young painter of unusual skill , J. Paul Verrees , a native of Turnhout , Belgium , came to America shortly after the World War . Mr. Verrees was trained in the National Academy at Antwerp where he studied architecture and in addition took the courses in painting and engraving , early joining the ranks of painter-gravers . He enlisted under the Belgian colors in 1914 but was wounded during the third month of the conflict and after considerable time spent in English and Scottish hospitals was discharged from military service . But even in convalescence he found much material for his etching needle and for his oil sketches . When he was able to do a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arthur Rackham , and came to America . Here he became one of the founders of an important art organization of our country , the Brooklyn Society of Etchers . Examples of his work can be seen in the museums and art centers of New York , Chicago , Washington , and San Francisco . // Hovsep Pushman , an American artist of Armenian birth , is an excellent craftsman and he finds in the objects of the East models of form and color which he paints with rare fidelity . It is , however , his portrait studies of the people of his homeland and neighboring countries that have given the greatest play for his technical proficiency and his fine power of interpretation . No American painter has equaled him in the skill and beauty with which he portrays these striking types . Among those that have recently been bought by public or private collectors are : An Armenian Girl , and Flowers of Armenia ; The Incense Burner , an Ethiopian child in purple dress against a green-blue background , holding a large brass incense burner in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in plum-colored robe with a yellow turban ; Turkestan , a young woman of that far eastern country exquisitely painted with a dim , delicately colored mural in the background ; The Portrait of a Chinaman , remarkably realistic yet pervasive in expression , altogether an interpretation of distinction . One doubts if any but a native of the East could do such portraits . The first man to arrange for an exhibition of paintings by American artists in Russia was Professor Nicholas Roerich , director of the Art School of Petrograd , who at that time could not have dreamed that some day he would be a citizen of our republic and an outstanding influence in American art . Professor Roerich was also president of the World of Art , an institution organized to extend the interests of the Russian people to art in all parts of the world . An advocate of the belief that through art and beauty would come better understanding among all peoples , he was looking then as now far beyond national boundaries . As a young man , Professor Roerich was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long since taken on international significance and are to be found in possibly more public and private collections the world over than that of any other // American citizen . But painting is not his only interest ; his master effort is to make all the arts better understood in their vital relation to life . His own canvases , many of them of great power and beauty , have gone far in this direction , serving both as means and end . Behind his virile work as a painter he has created and directed other forces for promoting beauty in life which have marked new achievements in America and in the world . Among these are the Master Institute of United Arts and the Corona Mundi , International Art Center , which he has founded in New York City in connection with the Roerich Museum . Neither these nor his scientific work in exploration and archeology in the Himalayas of China , Tibet , and India can be described here , but the conviction that underlies the broad work he is carrying on in both scientific and artistic fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Professor Roerich , " will unify all humanity . Art is one and indivisible . How many young hearts are searching for something real and beautiful ! So give it to them . Bring art to the people where it belongs . " FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS IN GRAPHIC ARTS There are two reasons for including the graphic arts in such an exhibition as we are considering ; first , because many of our citizens of foreign birth have made such important contributions in this field , and second , because examples of their work are readily available for such exhibitions as are advocated in this book . The graphic arts here will comprise the work of artists whose designs are reproduced in numbers . These may be either in the form of original prints as , for instance , etchings , wood block or linoleum prints , engravings , and certain lithographs ; or reproductive prints that may be made in large quantities partly through the aid of modern machinery as illustrations for books , magazines , and newspapers or as decorations in themselves . Typography , that branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts which has probably done most to advance civilization , might well be suggested , but since we can not attempt to be inclusive it will be better to stick closely to what might roughly be termed the pictorial side of the graphic arts which yield much interesting material for exhibition purposes . The countries represented by foreignborn artists in this field are : England , Czechoslovakia , Germany , Sweden , Russia , Poland , Hungary , Austria , and Holland . There is no more appropriate person with whom to begin than that old pioneer wood engraver , Timothy Cole , who worked at his craft in his home in Poughkeepsie , New York , until his death on May 7 , 1931 at the age of seventy-nine . Timothy Cole was born in London when Queen Victoria had been on the throne but fifteen years and was brought to the United States when he was three years old . His outstanding contribution to the art of America was his wood engravings of the old world masterpieces made from the original paintings in Europe and accompanied by the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flemish , English , Spanish , and French subjects published first in the Century Magazine and later in book form . We of the present generation , who have witnessed the growth of public and private collections of famous paintings in America and who now have within our reach countless reproductions of many of the most notable pictures throughout the world , can not know how much this pioneer work by Timothy Cole meant to the Americans of an earlier day who had never before seen even ordinary prints of the great old world canvases . These wood engravings were made before the halftone was invented , and the subjects chosen by Mr. Cole were done with deftness and feeling which in wood engraving in our country has never been excelled and will probably never again be equaled . In so great esteem is he held that many of the leading museums and private collectors of America have secured Mr. Cole 's en- // gravings and in some cases the original blocks from which the prints were made . Turning from this pioneer in the graphic arts to a brother craftsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of Rudolph Ruzicka . Born in Czechoslovakia but having received most of his training in America , Mr. Ruzicka has reached the position he holds , first by the quality of his engraving , and second by the way in which he has related the engraving to the printed page in some of our best examples of modern book-making . It is never possible to know just how much the influences of the artist 's homeland have affected his work , but it is always fair to give tradition and early environment some credit in an instance of such extraordinary individuality as Mr. Ruzicka 's work displays . Examples of his engravings are to be found in many private collections , and in the Art Institute of Chicago , the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences , and in several public libraries throughout the country . In libraries they are usually decorations or illustrations for books . A type of original print made from designs cut in wood , usually referred to as wood-block prints , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to us from Germany , and Bror Julius Olsson Norfeldt who was born in Tulstorg , Scania , Sweden . Probably no wood-block printer in America has a more complete mastery of his medium than Gustave Baumann , whose vigorous designs and beautiful color harmonies have so faithfully portrayed American subjects from his early studies of Indiana farms and villages to his present interpretations of the poetic architecture and natural background of the Indians of the Southwest . The homely scene appeals to him : houses of wood , old barns , flower and vegetable gardens , picket and rail fences , wagons , carts , wheelbarrows , flower pots and garden tools , the things with which and by which // folks work and live . He delights in trees , not the tree alone but the tree related to an old house , a stone fence or some other evidence of human life . This appreciation for the picturesqueness of human habitations Mr. Baumann has brought to his later work in the Taos country of the Southwest . One feels grateful to him for portraying for those not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beauty of Indian life . These records are sometimes reproduced in editions of one hundred , thus making available to a considerable number of people original prints of exceptional quality in which the subject is designed , cut into the wood-block , and printed by the artist himself . The work of Bror Julius Olsson Norfeldt is so individual that it is not possible to compare it with that of other artists . It does , however , as much perhaps as that of any other American working with wood-blocks , suggest the qualities of the Japanese wood-block prints from which its technique is evolved . It is probably in its colors and in the texture achieved more than in the forms used which suggest this similarity . There is a rugged quality in Norfeldt 's work which has made a distinct appeal to the public , and in addition to many prints privately owned purchases have been made for the New York Public Library , the Chicago Art Institute , the Toledo Art Museum , the Detroit Art Institute , and the Museum of New Mexico . An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had many recruits from artists of European birth . A fairly complete list of etchers could be secured through the American Federation of Arts , whose headquarters are in Washington , D.C. , and considerable first-hand information about the artists themselves through our two largest etchers ' organizations : the Brooklyn Society of Etchers , and the Chicago Society of Etchers . For the purpose of this chapter we shall have to limit our references to but one , William Auerbach Levy . // William Auerbach Levy was born in Russia in 1889 , came to America with his parents when very young , and spent his childhood as a typical New York East Side boy . It was in this environment that in later years , after he had received training in drawing and painting and had , through a European scholarship , studied and worked abroad , he found the picturesque models which he has interpreted with such fascination that his prints are probably in every museum in America which has collections of modern etchings , as well as in several European collections . Mr. Levy first studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Art Students ' League in New York City . Mr. Mielatz was a remarkable teacher and an etcher of exceptional ability and it is to this association that Mr. Levy acknowledges much of his development as a technician . But to this training Mr. Levy has added an extraordinary appreciation of subjects appropriate for interpretation by the etcher 's needle . One of his best-known subjects is The Blind Beggar , the model for which he found in the neighborhood where he grew up . From the many American illustrators of foreign birth we choose four : W. T. Benda from Poland , Willy Pogany from Hungary , Joseph Urban from Austria , and Hendrik van Loon from Holland . The name of W. T. Benda is familiar to many people through his decorative paintings , his illustrations for books and magazines , and his masks . Mr. Benda 's work is unlike that of any other illustrator , having a line , color , and texture distinctly its own . Though he is always progressing , it is a pleasure to look back at his earlier drawings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Public library is a good example . Here are portrayed , with exceptional character and spirituality , the eager faces of children from many lands as they may be seen any day , seeking picture and story books at this important educational center . What movement and color inform his remarkable drawing // of the rollicking peasants ' dance shown In the Illustration opposite page 140 ! This subject portrays the artist 's native Poland and reveals the play spirit of a people , so many of whom have become citizens of our country . Even more individualistic than his paintings , if possible , are Benda 's masks . He has transferred his skill in drawing and painting faces to this newer art of modeling in paper to which he had added a unique skill . His masks are built up from thin strips of paper and modeled in so lifelike a way as almost to startle one . To the headdress of some he gives a fantastic beauty that seems to surpass actuality . Willy Pogany , illustrator of folk tales and fairy stories , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his adoption . His first work done in America was a series of drawings for the Fairy Tales of Hungary , a book by Nandor Pogany , his brother , now translated into English . Later he illustrated several classics , including Gulliver 's Travels , Arabian Nights , Alice in Wonderland , Folk Tales from Many Lands , the Old Testament , Fairies and the Christmas Child , and Tales of a Persian Garden . Mr. Pogany has had wide experience in other fields , including the making of mural decorations , moving picture sets for famous cinema productions , and scenic sets for the Metropolitan Opera House . In any of these fields one will find a wealth of material suitable for exhibition . Joseph Urban , one of America 's most versatile artists , is widely known on both sides of the Atlantic as an illustrator , having achieved far more than a national reputation in his native Austria before he chose America for his home . If he had done nothing more than the pictures for Kling Klang Gloria he would have attained notable success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human interest are among the best illustrations of children 's books . Perhaps even more popular are his inimitable illustrations for Hans Andersen 's Fairy Tales and for the Brothers Grimm Stories . // But Mr. Urban has achieved equal recognition for work in other fields . He has done many stage settings for the Metropolitan Opera House , among which are Pelleas and Melissande by Debussy , Egyptian Helen by Strauss , and Don Juan by Mozart ; perhaps even more motion picture sets , notably When Knighthood Was in Flower . His work as an architect is outstanding , of this the Ziegfeld Theatre and the New School for Social Research on West 12th Street in New York City are well known . These references , although quite outside the field of illustration , are made for their obvious suggestions of exhibition material by this gifted artist . Since only one design can be chosen to represent Mr. Urban , an example of architecture which suggests both his versatility and his play spirit has been selected , the Gingerbread House at Hamburg , New Jersey . Hendrik van Loon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came to America from Holland . His illustrations are simple , quaint , and almost childlike in their directness . It is difficult among his countless pictures to refer to an especially outstanding one , but one of distinction is the frontispiece for the Story of Mankind . It is in text and drawing a fine example of van Loon 's graphic manner of expression . The text reads : " High up in the North in the land called Svithjod , there stands a rock . It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles wide . Once every thousand years a little bird comes to this rock to sharpen its beak . When the rock has thus been worn away , then a single day of eternity will have gone by . " The illustration for this text seems in perfect keeping with the simple but extraordinary statement it illustrates . FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS IN THE HANDICRAFTS There is a very large and important group of artists in our country which for convenience here will be called craftsmen . In the broad sense of the word , painters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fine arts ' field are all craftsmen , but they have so long been identified with particular branches of expression that it seemed convenient to classify them more specifically . The group here to be designated as craftsmen work in various materials ; wood , metal , glass , porcelain , and they make textiles , laces , or do some of the many forms of needlework , and so forth . The craftsmen chosen here include workers who came from Scotland , Austria , Poland , Sweden , Germany , Hungary , Lithuania , England , Italy , and Norway . There is no name that means more to the student of American woodwork from the beginning of the republic to the present day than that of Duncan Phyfe . Born in Scotland but coming to America as a young man , he was the last and perhaps the greatest of a noted line of early cabinetmakers in this country , most of them from England or Scotland . A number of Duncan Phyfe 's tables and chairs and secretaries are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . Probably no man 's work has been so widely and carefully copied by the manufacturers of fine furniture of the present day as that of Duncan Phyfe . Among our present-day woodcarvers or sculptors in wood , as they are sometimes and very properly called , only three of many names may be mentioned : I. Kirchmayer , a native of Austria ; Adam Dabrowski , born in Poland ; and Karl von Rydingsvard from Sweden . Mr. Kirchmayer is known to the architects with whom he worked in creating some of the best ecclesiastical carvings in our country as the creator of the American Gothic type in wood sculpture , and it gave him real pleasure to have his work so described . While most of his work was done in America , his woodcarving traditions are rooted in the medieval village of Oberammergau to which he had gone as a boy . There he lived and worked , mastering his chosen medium // while yet in his teens . Leaving Oberammergau , while still a young man he spent a few years in Paris and London and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technique that have set his work apart as probably the most perfect union of design and craftsmanship in our country . Among Mr. Kirchmayer 's works are : The Rood Beam , The Pulpit , The Font Cover , and twelve statues in the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin , New York City ; some extremely fine carvings in Detroit , including Christmas in Heaven , in the Detroit Institute of Arts , and some smaller pieces done for George C. Booth 's collection of the Work of American Craftsmen ; as well as some for the church at Cranbrook , Michigan . Adam Dabrowski , thoroughly trained in the traditions of his native Poland , has covered in his woodcarving a wide variety of subjects from the simplest peasant animal toys of his homeland to the most delicate and detailed carving of wild flowers . Not only has he done his part to preserve the wood sculpture traditions of his native country , but he has also helped carry forward its best traditions in physical and dramatic education among his young compatriots as a leader of the Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in Brooklyn where all types of woodcarving were taught . Karl von Rydingsvard is known as a craftsman and teacher on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts . Interesting among his many works are the woodcarvings in the Alaho , the palatial yacht of Arthur Curtis James , in which he has depicted the whole story of the development of water transportation . Mr. von Rydingsvard has not only made the handicrafts of his adopted country richer because he has added Swedish to American motifs , but he has also worked out important experiments in proving the therapeutic value of woodcarving for certain types of invalids and handicapped persons . - 45 RESOURCES FOR FUTURE EXHIBITIONS while yet in his teens . Leaving Oberammergau , while still a young man he spent a few years in Paris and London and then came to America where he developed elements of thought and technique that have set his work apart as probably the most perfect union of design and craftsmanship in our country .

The work of Samuel Yellin of Philadelphia is known throughout our country , ranging from the heaviest iron gates to the most delicately wrought escutcheons for the keyhole of a jewel box . Examples from his hands are the great iron gates to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company 's yards in Philadelphia , the gates to and the metal work in the Harkness Memorial Tower at Yale University , the doors of the Bok Singing Tower at Lake Wales , Florida , the iron work in the chapel at Valley Forge and in the National Cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not limited to his superior craftsmanship . He has a school in connection with his workshop where he gives boys who have a special aptitude for metal work an opportunity to learn the best that is known in it . His museum of iron handicraft including many rare examples , both ancient and modern , and his fine library together with his personal help are available to these young craftsmen . Mr. Yellin 's shop with its forges glowing and its hammers and anvils clanking as men and boys pound away , shaping the hot metal into permanent forms for some museum piece , a special order for a client , or perhaps a personal thing to go into the home of a workman , is a sight and sound not soon forgotten . Oscar Bach is not only a craftsman of rare ability in iron , but also a sculptor and painter . Although he is perhaps best known for his work in iron , yet he designs and works brass , copper , and alloys , and some of his finest examples include enamels applied to metal with singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things have gone into fine American homes . His work covering a wide variety of subjects is always designed and executed with perfect appropriateness in harmony with the masonry , woodwork , gardens , or other architectural features with which they are associated . // Hunt Diederich who came to America from Hungary works chiefly in flat metal , its character expressed largely in silhouettes . He delights in making useful things beautiful , weather vanes , fire screens , candlesticks , mudscrapers , and so forth , but he often accepts large architectural commissions such as lighting fixtures and metal staircases . He models some pieces of free sculpture , separately and in the round for purely ornamental purposes . In these the distinguishing feature is usually the silhouette , which finds expression in horses , particularly polo ponies , dogs , cats , deer , chickens , and other members of the animal family . He also enjoys doing silhouettes in scissor cuttings from paper . A craftsman in the precious metals , gold , platinum , and silver and the finer alloys of bronze , one who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsmen , is Louis Rosenthal , born in the village of Plungyan in what was then the Russian province of Kavno , now Lithuania . We can not here trace his interesting development from the small boy carving images in tree trunks in the forests of Lithuania to the unique place he now holds as a miniature sculptor in his adopted America . To some he is known as the Penknife Sculptor and there is a certain correctness in the description , for all his figures are done originally in wax with a small penknife as the only tool . But Penknife Sculptor is an inadequate title for an artist who has been compared in technique to Benvenuto Cellini . It is doubtful if Cellini was ever able to cast miniature bronzes in as delicate and perfect form as several Mr. Rosenthal has made . Among the best known of Mr. Rosenthal 's sculptures are : Samson and the Foxes , an enduring bronze statue only one and one-half inches high ; Hercules and the Centaur ; The Spirit of the Jest ; and The Bacchanalian Dance , all four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his Memorial to the Unknown Soldier of Greece the soldier measures but half an inch and the whole group less than three // inches high . His monument to Charles P. Steinmetz called The Spirit of Electricity is two and one-half inches high . Mr. Rosenthal 's study of Beethoven , although miniature , is very impressive both in conception and in execution . Here he has modeled the aged and blind musician standing beside an open piano , striking with one hand the notes which he can not hear while in the clouds above him are the heavenly trumpeters sounding the themes of the Ninth Symphony to the enraptured sense of the great composer . These works not only deserve a place of honor as examples of American sculpture , but measured from the standpoint of craftsmanship alone they are creations of a very high order . From work in wood and metal it seems but a step to the very old crafts of stained and leaded glass . Of the craftsmen in glass only two will be mentioned : Clement Heaton , a native of England ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaton came to America after working for years in England and later in Switzerland where he had made or restored a number of windows in the churches of the Alpine republic , he felt that he must find a place here away from the hurrying and bustling city . He craved the time and opportunity to design and carry out his work in the spirit of the early craftsmen . After a long search he found just what he wanted in a rural settlement known as Valley Cottage , about thirty miles out of New York City . An old farmhouse was restored and added to for the family residence while the old barn was converted into a studio and workrooms , and what remained of an old grist mill fashioned into an ideal shop for the glass furnace and for other operations essential to the making of glass . The mill flume was repaired and water from the mill pond above was again turned in . With the countryside as a setting Mr. Heaton has built up a complete plant , if such a rural achievement could he designated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works out his designs , and with the assistance of members of his // family and occasionally some neighbors whom he has trained he is able to carry out his ideas . Mr. Heaton is an authority on old glass and has an extraordinary collection of material and a valuable library on this subject at Valley Cottage . Among the more important pieces of work by him are the rose window in the Church of the Blessed Sacrament , New York City ; seven windows for the College of Preachers at the Episcopalian Cathedral , Washington , D. C. ; and the west window in Emmanuel Church at Newport , Rhode Island . Nicola D'Ascenzo , the Italian-born designer , has recently been awarded the medal of the American Institute of Architects for his craftsmanship in stained and leaded glass . Although he has executed many commissions , probably his best-known work is in the Memorial Chapel at Valley Forge . In referring to this work , Charles J. Connick of Boston has said , " The architects of that chapel are to be commended for their judgment in assigning this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to control the entire color scheme of the interior with results that are remarkably beautiful and satisfying . Mr. D'Ascenzo has brought to his work in glass a poet 's fancy , a thorough artistic training , an exuberant love for color , and a sturdy sense of form that gives distinction to his work . " It is interesting to note that in this chapel planned by the Philadelphia architect the late Milton Medary has brought together in a harmony of extraordinary beauty the work of three American craftsmen , all citizens by choice and all noted for their excellence : the glass by Nicola D'Ascenzo ; iron work by Samuel Yellin , born in Poland ; and woodcarving by Edward Maene , a native of Belgium . The field of the arts and crafts overlaps again in the porcelain sculpture of Mrs. George Oakley Totten of Washington , D.C. , who came to us from Sweden , and whose achievements , as well as her experiments with the Lenox porcelain // works at Trenton , New Jersey , mark a comparatively new development in the field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before coming to America , achieved distinction for her modeling and painting in porcelain of peasants , of children from many lands , and of characters inspired by the folklore and fairy tales of the old world . Among her best-known pieces , some of which are owned in America , are The Princess and the Goblin , The Minuet , Cinderella , The Goblin in the Woods , and The Swineherd and the Princess . These porcelain figures are cast in very small numbers and are as truly sculpture as anything in bronze or metal . Because beautiful colors can be fired into them and made permanent , they are considered by some people to be very choice forms of sculpture and have been purchased by a number of American museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City . There is a great field of craftsmanship which must be passed over lightly here , but which would yield much material for such exhibitions as we are considering . This is the work of the many immigrant women who have brought to the new world their centuries-old traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and needle crafts . Two references only can be made here : one to an artist , Pauline Fjelde , born in Norway , who has interpreted scenes and legends of her adopted land in tapestries of excellent quality ; the other , Anna Ernberg , a native of Sweden , who as a craftsman and teacher has exerted a very important influence in the development of weaving and other handicrafts in our country . Pauline Fjelde came to America with her parents , who settled in Minnesota . She inherited what seems to have been a family instinct for craftsmanship , for her brother Jakob was a sculptor . Miss Fjelde found her greatest pleasure in carrying out the old Norse art of picture tapestry weaving in connection with the Indian legends linked with // the region in which the family lived . Her most notable achievement is The Hiawatha Tapestry based on Longfellow 's poem , which may be seen hanging in the exhibition rooms of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts . It is about ten feet wide and twelve feet high and includes the Falls of Minnehaha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that region . Woven into the tapestry underneath the scene are the following descriptive lines from the poem : Through their thoughts they heard a footstep , Heard the rustling in the branches ; And with glowing cheeks and forehead , With the deer upon his shoulders , Suddenly from out the woodlands Hiawatha stood before them . Miss Fjelde 's genius and enthusiasm were not limited to the portrayal of the theme itself but she designed a remarkable border of black silhouettes on a lavender background , depicting forty-four scenes of Indian life . The whole work from the concept , the research involved , the spirit of the legend portrayed , the harmonious use of color , and the excellent technique make it a notable achievement . Anna Ernberg received her early training in her native Sweden where the handicrafts are widely practiced in the home . After coming to the United States she established her place as a teacher and craftsman in several cities of the North , but came to feel that the greatest need for help in weaving was in the mountain sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there seemed to be no modern substitute for them . In the mountains there was much time for work , especially in the winter months . If the old crafts could be saved they would increase the meager incomes and serve as an outlet for the creative impulse which she felt to be strong in these mountain folk . In 1914 she was asked to take charge of the // weaving at Berea College in Kentucky . She developed this department until hundreds of students have learned weaving and through its practice have been able to earn their way through college . In addition to the school work Mrs. Ernberg has helped the Fireside Industries in the mountain homes in the region of Berea , both by helping the workers to improve their technique and also by finding new and enlarged markets for their products . This development in the handicrafts of the Kentucky mountains marks a distinct contribution to the field of social work . The foregoing are but a few of the countless men and ' women from other lands who have become citizens of our country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise would not have had . It would be easy through consulting the lists of artists in any field to find a considerable number of the foreign born from which any community could draw for its needs in carrying out a homelands exhibition . For instance , the American Federation of Arts in its Art Annual gives a rather comprehensive list of American painters and sculptors . This list alone will yield the names of several hundred foreign-born artists . Many are well known but not generally thought of as having come from other countries . And what is especially significant is that they have come from nearly every section of Europe . It is natural that we should think of the contributions of the immigrant to the material life of the nation for these have been tremendous . They are tangible and can be measured in terms of money or gain . But the cultural contributions are not so tangible , not so susceptible of measurement . Yet they are very great . If , as this book suggests , these cultural contributions are sought out and set forth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding not only between our native and our foreign-born citizens , but it will go far toward building up friendly feelings for the homelands of Europe from which millions of our citizens have come . // CONCLUSION IN THE foregoing experiments in appreciation of the arts and crafts of the homelands or the folk arts , as they are often called , the exhibitions have been used as a means to social ends . They have helped to bring about better understanding ; they have stimulated social and civic cooperation ; have encouraged aliens to become citizens ; have given immigrants a sense of validity through expressed esteem for their qualities and achievements ; have brought into closer sympathy immigrant parents and their American-born children ; and have created lasting friendships between native and foreign-born citizens . In these and other ways they have given a new and larger meaning to the word Americanization . These exhibitions and festivals have accomplished much more than their immediate social objectives . They have helped to show us what we owe to the peoples who have come from other lands and have revealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event has uncovered unsuspected resources of beauty and skill , a capacity for taking pains in everyday things , a joyousness in life itself expressed through the handicrafts , the music , the dances , the dramas , and the ceremonies presented . Often the articles displayed or the entertainment given , the sacrifices made to carry on an undertaking without thought of personal gain , have shown a purpose , an integrity of character and of sentiment , a power and loyalty in working for a common cause upon which good citizenship is based . Moreover , for the time being each exhibition has created in its community a local museum of immigrant contributions . // It has broadened the horizon and enriched the life of all who have taken part as either participant or visitor . If it were possible to bring together and unite in a single event these several exhibitions and their accompanying entertainments , a great folk museum and festival would be created the like of which no other country has known . And yet such an event would only suggest the great reserve of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But extensive as this reserve is , unless more is done in the near future to conserve these human values than has been done in the past they are certain to suffer serious diminution if not completely to disappear . There are two powerful forces at work which threaten them . One is our national policy of attempted regulation of immigration and our attitude toward the immigrant ; and the second is the extension of standardizing influences in the homelands themselves where much of the folk culture is being destroyed at its source . To the first , reference has been made in some detail in the early pages of this volume . ' It is enough to say here that we are beginning to see that one of the effects of our method is not regulation but restriction . Suddenly and unexpectedly we have reached a point where this stream of new life which has flowed into the United States almost without interruption for generations is now running from us rather than to us ; that more people are leaving America for other lands than are coming to our shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further immigrant cultural accretions , we must through encouragement or adaptation do what we can to make the folkways that have already become part of our life stream , permanent , either in their present form or in forms which a new environment and a new use will determine . All the more must we make this effort because of the deadening effect of the standardization that , in spite of its many // advantages to society , is leveling the differences of custom and expression in the homelands and destroying so much of the culture that has grown out of centuries of comparative isolation . Easy transportation , factory-made products , the cinema , are taking the place of the oxcarts whose animals were garlanded at the harvest , the needle and the loom where workers sang their occupational songs , the festivals at which they danced their hearts out . A standardized age is a sophisticated age in which the simple home arts of the people too often wither and die . It is not with the wish to discourage modern processes that these conditions are mentioned here ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people to do their part to control them . Never again will there be so good an opportunity to preserve the old folk arts and folkways as now . And it seems reasonable to hope that here in America a way may be found to save for tomorrow these fine expressions of yesterday . In this effort too much importance can not be attached to events which have been recorded in these pages , events that have brought to a considerable number of American communities inspiring glimpses of the arts and crafts , the music , the native dances , and other graces of our immigrant people . While the examples which these pioneering communities have set should be followed by others throughout the country , it would seem now that we are ready for another and more permanent step in the program of conserving these human values and integrating them into American life . And there are signs that this new step will be taken . The growth of public and private art museums in the United States during the last twenty-five years is one of the outstanding facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been concerned with the promotion of the fine arts , but here and there special attention has been given to the arts of daily life , the folk arts , and to their place in his-155
