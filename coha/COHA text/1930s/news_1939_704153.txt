txt ? Three years ago , Mr. and Mrs. Herbert L. Beer were residents if California , dmigr ? s from New England farmlands . A decade of 2hasing the rainbow in the West lad brought only disappointment and poverty , finally thrusting them , with their nine children , on welfare lists . Today , through pluck , well-directed intelligence , and wise utilization of Federal help , they live in a comfortable eight-room house on a 90-acre farm spreading over mellow Spencer hills . They own 16 Jerseys , a horse named Jenny , wagons , a tractor , all necessary farm tools , and " Dirty " the dog . Crops are growing well ; harvest is expected to yield the coming year 's supplies and enough to pay of part of the Government loan which financed their new start . The Beer migration , from East to West and back again , reversing the downward trek of the pilgrims in John Steinbeck 's " Grapes of Wrath , " is more than usually interesting in this period when failures seem to dominate more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both descendants of Massachusetts farming families , Mr. and Mrs. Beer left the State for California , beckoned by an opportunity then too glamorous to resist , but it was only a chimera . Only a few miles from Hollywood . they were to lace the stark fact they were entirely on their own , and that meant farming again . But farming in California was entirely different from what it had been in New England . What was most despairing to the Beers was the need for irrigation wherever they went . It was an artificial existence , they felt . Unable to make their three-acre " ranch " pay , the Beers were forced to draw on the State 's relief funds . Nine children require food , a lot of it . Only a gifted novelist could picture the inborn Yankee abhorrence of accepting charity ; but folks like the Beers talk little about such things , They just clamp their jaws down , determined to get out of the hole , and stay out . But they had more than determination . They had some bright ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home management , subsistence diets , clothing design , and other ways of wrkitging every last bit of value out of their relief allotment . By dint of much striving , they actually ate , dressed , lived  --  all II of them  --  for 91,000 a year , and they did it for two long , lean years At the end of this time they had a nest egg of $200 in cash . They were ready to return to the Yankee soil . Income and Travel They bought an old ear for $15 Mr. Beer labored until it ran satisfactorily , acquired a few tires , installed a seat for mien of the nine and racks for their clothes . A box of breakfast food , and a crate or two of oranges and grapefruit from the orange country , and a tent  --  the Beers Were ready to start for home , Cash on hand totaled $160 . Three thousand miles later $90 of it was still intact . Mr. Beer 's appearance at the Worcester office of the Farm Security Administration did not take place for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up their tent in East Brookfield where they lived on whatever the head of the family could earn on near-by farms . Finding it irksome to work for others and knowing the impracticability of a tent in New England winter , Mr. Beer recalled the suggestion of a Western friend that he try to obtain a loan from the Government under the Bankhead Act . Only Four Loans Let This measure authorized the Farm Bureau to lend money to : arm-tenants in accordance with a rehabilitation policy . With farm ownership more of a problem in New England than farm tenancy , only four of these loans have been decided on in Massachusetts , with two more slated for the coming year . The Beers were first . Richard I. Clapp , head of the local office , heard Mr. Beer 's story , then  --  with a smugness to which he later confessed  --  told the man that only those actually living on a farm could obtain loans . Mr. Beers said he 'd be back . Less than two weeks later he returned and reported he 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in with his family . Sm ? igness gone , Mr. Clapp listened and then pointed out that some outside income was also necessary . In s week 's time , Mr. Beers came back , hands calloused and cracked , with a job . This time Mr , Clapp was definitely interested , heard the full story and determined to help all he could . He sent the , file through to Boston , for the approval of the district supervisor , Roger I. Clapp . Some weeks later , the " 0 . K. " came through from Washington , and Mr. Beer was told to pick out a farm , as the Bureau could n't approve the one he was on , Farm Supports Them Now in its second year under his management , the Beer farm has proved it can support his family . Six acres are under cultivation ; several are producing hay . With his herd of Jerseys , Mr. Beer is able to cater to a specialized market ; he has several hundred chickens , He has a home , for his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace , and is digging a well . Best of all , he has the help and obedience of nine boys and girls , the eldest a lad of about 17 who looks more like his father 's brether than son , the youngest a boy who will enter Spencer schools this fall  --  and there is Mrs. Beer , the home manager . Under her direction , the girls do all the cooking and sewing . Together , they " put up " the fruits and vegetables which provide the menu for the winter and until next harvest . And although they live several miles from a city , the lour young ladies of the house and their mother do not allow feminine fashions to languish , Typically , they remade their housecoats to follow the " dirndl " trend , and now they 're watching the ads and patterns for further changes . The boys eagerly revealed the - gimlet- ties of their sisters , and while the girls were n't around , said Beverly was a " whiz " at cakes , pies , and practically all kinds of cookery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle and thread , and Doris , eldest of the girls , was an assistant home manager and general aide to Mrs. Beer , As for Ethel Jo , there 's an impish gleam in her eyes that easily bespeaks the tomboyishness that graced her namesake in the tales uy Louisa M. Alcott . Naturally , with five boys and four girls in one family , there is bound to be a good deal of skylarking and an occasional insurrection . The latter usually passes quickly , all of the children possessing a vivid recollection of the tioubles now behind them , and the need for hard work to keep them there . Each boy and girl has a particular chore , the two youngest specializing in weeding the home garden . No playing is allowed until work is done . Loan on Ills Own In his community , as well as with Federal officials , Mr. Beer 's courage , perseverance , and industry have won admiration . When it came time to dispose of the $15 caravan and get a newer machine , Mr. Beer settled on laity-Mg a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he applied to a local bank which accepted without hesitation his unindorsed note . In spare moments , Mrs. Beer and the children are scraping the paint from the wagon , and plan to varnish it . Easy times are not yet in sight for the Beers . Their only cash income is from the sale of milk , eggs , chickens , and a few vegetables . Mr. Beer has 40 years to repay the loan the Government made , but no one , although Mr. Beer is reserved about his plans  --  and most of this saga of East and West had to be told by others  --  expects him to take that long .
