In a Cincinnati cemetery one day last week a weeping widow stood at her husband 's grave . Suddenly out of the graveyard solitude came a voice . She listened , caught the word Reds-over &; over , louder &; louder . A little alarmed but more curious , she picked her way along the row of tombstones , came upon a mound of fresh earth . Peering around it , she discovered the source of the strange voice : a portable radio was keeping a pair of gravediggers posted on what was going en at Crosley Field five miles away . <P> What was going on at Crosley Field was of prime importance not only to gravediggers but to practically every one of Cincinnati 's 450,000 citizens . Businessmen carried radios to their offices , golfers had caddies tote portables along with their clubs . For the Cincinnati Reds ( " Our Boys " to baker and banker alike ) were in the throes of their first pennant in 20 years and , like an expectant father , the whole town stood nervously by . At Crosley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " crucial serious , " Our Boys were playing the Cardinals-the swaggering , slugging Gas House Gang from St. Louis . <P> Even Cincinnati 's dog-collared dowagers - to whom Reds usually meant Bolsheviks , flies pests and bunting something one wrapped a baby in-could reel off the minutest details of the Reds ' harrowing experiences the past month : a robust team with a fielding average of .975 ( best in the league ) and a batting average of .273 ( third best ) , they were leading the National League by twelve games on August i and looked like a cinch to win the pennant ; but last week , mind you , they were struggling to defend a precarious 2-game lead against the Cardinals , who had unfeelingly slugged their way to 20 victories in their last 24 games . Manager Bill McKechnie had lost 23 pounds in six weeks . <P> On the first day of last week 's crucial series , Our Boys had split a double-header with the Cards . The second day , beloved Bucky Walters , the renovated third-baseman who had pitched 27 victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , on the third day , came Our Boys ' last chance to nail the pennant in front of the homefolks . With three games left to play they could still clinch it in Pittsburgh , by winning two games of their final series against the Pirates . But the Reds had been shut out in the last two games , had failed to score a run in 24 innings ; their fielding had become butterfingered . Things looked dark in Cincinnati . <P> At Crosley Field 18,000 agonizing fans crammed into the grandstands . Twisting their scorecards , they watched big Paul Derringer face the formidable bats of Enos Slaughter ( .321 ) , Joe Medwick ( .333 ) , Johnny Mize ( .351 ) and Don Padgett ( .410 ) - baseball 's hardest-hitting quartet . Derringer had won 24 games this year , had struck out 124 batters and walked only 35 . Yet even his most devoted admirers feared the worst .
