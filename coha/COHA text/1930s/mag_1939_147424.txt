In all his scouring of the subversive underworld , rawboned Martin Dies of Texas , First Whip of the Red Hunting pack , never put on the stand a real , live , honest-to-goodness Communist . At his House Committee on Un-American Activities hearing last week in Washington he could have reached out and touched one : wispy , unobtrusive Earl Browder , general secretary ( at $40 a week ) of the Communist Party , its 1936 Presidential candidate . <P> Unfortunately for cigar-chewing Congressman Dies ( last week he switched to gum ) , Witness Browder was under wraps . His pipe line to Moscow had failed to inform him of the Communazi non-aggression pact in time to prepare a U. S. explanation in keeping with Comintern ethics . Last week his explanation sounded like something out of a fairy tale : " It the pact caused dismay in Tokyo . . . broke the Axis . . . reopens the open door in China . . . lessens the danger , of Fascist penetration in South America . . . is one more step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of his testimony Comrade Browder warmed over his story , told in 1936. of the offer of a man named Davidson ( who said he represented a half-dozen rich Republicans ) to enrich the party by $250,000 if it named President Roosevelt on its 1936 ticket , declared the party had turned toward conservatism since 1935 , discoursed on its tenets , tactics , tanglements . <P> Damaging to Earl Browder 's story of Communist innocence undented was the testimony of his former comrade , beefy Benjamin Gitlow , ousted from the general secretaryship of the party in 1929 . <P> In that year , he said , Stalin swallowed the U. S. party , cleaned out its personnel , put in his puppet Browder . To Browder 's claim that funds no longer flowed through the Moscow pipe line , Witness Gitlow replied that they used to come at the rate of $100,000 a year , probably still did . <P> More embarrassing to Earl Browder was an admission he let slip that he traveled through Europe during the last two years on a false U. S. passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Comrade Browder declined to answer on the ground that doing so might tend to incriminate him . Well might he be cautious . Day before , Secretary of State Cordell Hull had warned that all travelers on fake passports would be prosecuted if apprehended ( possible penalty : $2,000 fine and five years in jail ) . <P> To previous knowledge of U. S. Communist goings-on the evidence added nothing . But it did prove one thing : that Earl Browder 's party is still hog-tied to the dictates , the machinations of Moscow , wherever they may lead .
