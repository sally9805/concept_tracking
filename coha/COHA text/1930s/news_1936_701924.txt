txt Letters to the Sports Editor TROPHY FOR BOAT RACING S. M. Auerbach Offers One in Memory of His Father . To Sports Editor of The Now York Times : Culminating much thought , I believe it would be altogether fitting and proper to offer a valuable perpetual boat racing trophy in memory of my father , Judge Emil Auerbach , who died recently . As yet , I have not selected the event or regatta at which the trophy will be at stake . This will be done in the near future , as I hope to have the prize up for competition this season . Judge Auerbach , as you know , was very keenly interested in boat racing , attending regattas in all parts of the United States and Canada , and he sought to do everything possible to assist in the promotion of the sport , often performing in the capacity of official and adviser . Therefore , I believe it is fitting that his name should be perpetuated with a trophy . S. MORTIMER AUERBACH . Miami , Fla. , May 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
