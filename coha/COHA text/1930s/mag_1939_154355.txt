Ever since the World War transformed the U. S. from a debtor to a creditor nation , it has been economically unhealthy for the U. S. to export more goods than it imports . ( Debts can not be collected unless the U. S. buys more from its debtors than they buy from it . ) Last week the Department of Commerce reported that 1938 's export surplus of $1,133,567,000 was the largest since 1921 . <P> Reason for the 17-year record : Depression II cut imports , notably raw materials for manufacture , 36% to $1,960,528,000 , while steadier business conditions abroad , plus demand for armaments and food , held U. S. exports at $3,094,095,000 , a drop of only 8% . <P> Foreign consumers met the difference in several ways-with U. S. money left in Europe by tourists , sent home by emigrants or paid to foreign shippers carrying U. S. goods . But the principal way they paid for goods was with gold , of which the U. S. now holds 60% of the world 's monetary supply .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
