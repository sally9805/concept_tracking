C ' C 9 6 -- t THE CONSECRATED COAL SCUTTLE A STORY BY DOROTHY THOMAS N OBODY having " come forward " during the invitation hymn , Old Brother Bates was disappointed and a little put out when the benediction did not follow the dumping of the hymn books into the racks . He had taken the benediction for granted and was standing with his eyes closed , fumbling behind him with one of his long trembling hands for his overcoat , when he felt the hand of his third wife tugging sharply at his elbow . He never thought of Mrs. Bates , never spoke of her except as his third wife , reminding her and him and anyone who was about that he had had other and better wives . But he had learned patience with his ninety years and , tired as he was , he did not protest but bent his long legs and sat down unsteadily beside her and looked kindly around on the people . He could not hear at all unless they shouted in his left ear but he could see remarkably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they usually did when he stood or sat a long time in one place . He wiggled his toes in his boots but his feet were not the warmer for the effort . He looked at the pastor , thinking hopefully that the benediction had been delayed only by a tardy announcement , or that possibly this business of sitting down for a moment after the closing hymn was the result of some new scheme the women were trying out , like the having of Sunday School afterchurch , a piece of foolishness that had been in effect a number of years when his second wife , Ida , had been with him . Because of a pain and soreness in his back , he had been kept away from church for he had no idea how many Sundays . His staying at home was a notion of the doctor 's . He dimly remembered a small delegation of church men coming to his house to intercede for his presence this Sunday . He clutched after this recollection , trying to remember why it was they wanted him to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fat and heavy-jowled man , a newcomer who had been in the town and in the church less than twenty years ( he distinctly remembered that he was not there at the time of Ida 's funeral ) , had climbed up on the rostrum , not going up the steps like a man bent on holy business , but clambering up over the little curtained rod , " like a thief and a robber , " throwing his fat leg up over and catching hold of the corner of the pulpit to steady himself , and then standing there , puffing out his fat front , his coat pushed back and his finger tips in his vest pockets , saying something to make the women and children snicker . It was not Bellows , however , who seemed peculiar , for it was not the first time he had seen him make a fool of himself to the intended glory of God and the amusement of the ladies . It was the coal scuttle . It was sitting , not near the stove , but a good six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people , on the communion table , on that piece of furniture that his second wife , Ida , because she had been brought up an Episcopalian , could not get over calling " the altar . " Brother Bates was about to lay his great hand on the third wife 's knee and incline his head and ask her in a whisper if it was actually the coal scuttle he saw there , when all doubt was removed . Brother Bellows had leaned forward , steadying his bulk against the pulpit , and caught up the coal scuttle and held it high above his head , then set it down again on the table . The minister , sitting behind the pulpit in the leftmost of the three carved chairs , seemed to sanction these antics , to condone them at feast , by uncrossing his legs and recrossing them the other way , while he swung his glasses slowly by the earpieces . It was a very strange thing to see a coal scuttle on the communion table . The organist got up from where she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellows , and went to the organ . Old Brother Bates forgot the coal scuttle in watching her walk . She slunk across the rostrum , slid onto the organ stool , and slumped forward with her hands in her lap , her head turned toward Bellows , waiting for the word to play . Brother Bates forgot the coal scuttle and lost himself in a dream of his first wife , Daisy . He shut his eyes and saw her coming from the sod house with a jug of buttermilk on her shoulder . She walked in the furrow , erect and very slim , the wind whipping her skirts , the jug on her shoulder , like a girl out of the Old Testament . When she came to him she rested , leaning within the handles of the plow , her bonnet pushed back , her wide white forehead and her upper lip beaded with sweat . If Old Brother Bates could have heard what Brother Bellows was saying he would have come back from his dream in a hurry , for Brother Bellows was through cajoling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had told them the Sunday before to leave a slow fire under their kettles because they were to be kept in church a little over-time for a special purpose . He was through with his playful mock surprise at finding a coal scuttle on the communion table . He had begun to talk about Old Brother Bates , and the people of the congregation were turning in their pews to look round at the old man where he sat , head and shoulders above the men round him , his eyes closed and a look like Kingdom Come on his face . Brother Bellows was saying , " I 'm going to ask Sister Atkins to play for us some good old hymn ; and while she plays the deacons and elders of this church are going to join hands with one another in prayer , and while they pray we are going to ask you to come and put your offering here in this coal bucket . For , Brothers and Sisters , coal is cash this winter , and we 've got to pay for every ton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're here to raise this money . Yes , do n't hold back or be afraid to come , Brothers , Sisters . There is someone in this church to-day that the sight of moves my heart to tears , and I think it ought to move yours too . When God sent me this idea for raising this money to buy this coal in this way , I said , ' It sounds like a fine idea , Lord , but I ca n't do it alone . And the elders of this church ca n't do it alone . ' I thought about it and prayed and then the light came to me , and I said , Lord , there is a fine old man in our midst , a Saint , if ever there was one . He was here and helped break the sod when the first church was made , a little sod house down in what is now McTuffy 's pasture . And he was here and helped raise the building when the first frame church was put up on this ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and he was here and helped with his own hands to lay the cornerstone when this edifice was builded , long ere I came here myself . ' His limbs have grown feeble , his sight dim , and the grinders few , in his faithful service of his Master and this church ; but he 's here still , thank God , he 's still among us . And I put it up to the Elders at a Board meeting of this church last Thursday . I said , ' Let 's go together and ask Brother Bates to come out this Sunday and help us . Let 's ask him to close our little season of prayer , to raise his trembling old voice in this cause . ' And we went . Yes , we went together and we found this grand old man of God sitting by his fire ( his good wife let us in and led us to him ) , sitting there communing , I have little doubt , with that heavenly home toward which he has drawn so near . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wiped his nose and both his eyes . " And we told him why we had come . It seemed a little hard for him to understand at first , but when , with the help of his good helpmeet , we made our mission known to him , he nodded and said , Yes . Yes . ' The old man has been ailing , and it is at considerable risk that he came out in the cold to-day , but he would not stay at home . No , at a time like this he felt that his place was in the House of the Lord . Now , Sister Atkins , will you play , please , very softly and while she plays , the deacons will raise brief prayers . May your hearts be opened and your pocket books likewise . Pray right where you are , Brothers , and lastly we are going to ask Brother Bates to come down here in front , where we can all see him and have the inspiration of his presence , and , Brothers , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with the faith of a little child , and sends up his petition  --  God pity you ! Will you lead us , Brother Rouse ? " Old Brother Bates had been wandering a long time in his sixty-five-yearold dream . He came out of it when he felt his third wife poking him again , suggesting that he resume an attitude of prayer . Instead , he opened his eyes . Ahead of him three pews and across the aisle , Phil Rouse was praying , his hands pushed into his coat pockets , his face tilted up , swaying gently backward and forward as he prayed . Though he could not see his face and could not have read his lips at such a distance had he faced him , Old Brother Bates felt that he knew Brother Rouse 's prayer , knew it by heart , from the " Oh , Thou great Shepherd of the Sheep " to the final " and save us all in Heaven at last without the loss of a single lamb . " Rouse 's prayer had always irritated him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been a sheep country . It was probably fifteen years since his ears had been good enough to hear all of that prayer but be remembered it . Rouse was a good man though , but not so good a man as he , Bates . Not as good , certainly , in the eyes of the woman who had mattered to the two of them , in the eyes of Ida , his second wife , dead now for over thirty years . Rouse had lived in New York State and knew Ida and her husband there before they came West . He had had the inside track . The day the two of them had gone on horseback to Ida 's place , a good half-day 's ride , to look at the place was the first day he had seen her . They found her standing near the doorstep feeding her chickens . She was a little woman and round . She had looked at him gravely from under her low , black brows , her hands cupping either elbow , and waited long I enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A rare quiet woman and kind . He had had her buried a grave space away from Daisy so that he could rest between them when the time came . His third wife would not like that but there was little she could do about it . It was in his will where he was to lie . Rouse had been a good fifteen years younger and a richer man , but it had not got him anywhere with Ida . She had looked them over when the time came to decide , not coyly , but gravely , and chosen the widower . He felt his third wife 's elbow in his ribs . She wanted something of him again . She was trying to pry him up . He got to his feet . There in the aisle Ed Tookey and Bob Rollins were waiting for him . They wanted him to go down to the front and pray , it seemed . Small men , Ed and Bob . He looked down on their heads as he walked between them . Bald now , both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his melons and warming them good . Bob had bellowed like a calf . He leaned on them heavily , for his feet were numb , almost without any feeling . It would he warmer near the stove . They had been in the church a long time , past all reason . They led him to the communion table and let go of him , left him standing there , wavering a little . He felt the vibration of the organ music . Communion time , was it ? Strange to leave the communion to the last like that Was he supposed to give thanks for the Wine or for the Loaf , and where was the other elder ? Someone brushed past him and made him open his eyes . It was a woman , one of the Semler girls , the one they had called the pretty one . He had paid some attention to her himself the summer before he found Ida . Mrs. Beach she was now , a fat old woman and a grandmother likely . She seemed to be cry ing , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something out . Yes , there stood the coal scuttle . Unquestionably , it was not for the communion service that they had brought him down here . He put his long fingers in his beard and pulled his underlip . Now , for the life of him , he could not remember what he was to pray for . Was it for victory in time of war ? It might he . Certainly , there was a dearth of young men in the house . Was it for rain in time of drought ? No , it was winter time , and powerfully cold in the place . Was it for baptism by fire ? There was a familiarity about that thought but he rejected it . The church had got over believing in baptism by fire years and years ago . No use . He had to get started . His third wife would scold him when they got home for being so slow . He would pray for guidance . That would be safe enough : guidance . He brought his shaking hands together so that the finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he forgot that he had nothing more definite than guidance to pray for . He prayed joyously and a long time . Phrases he had not used since he was in his prime came to his lips . Tears slid from under his lids . He tasted them in his beard , but he did not stop . He prayed for guidance in the thick of battle , in the wilderness , and in the paths of the trackless deep . While he prayed the people kept passing by him . He saw their shadows through his eyelids . Having them moving so near him was confusing at first , but after a little he forgot them . He quoted whole passages from the Psalms , from the Books of Ecclesiastes , and Job . At last he lost himself in a long figure of speech and could not remember what be had meant to say . He stopped , drew a deep breath , and opened his eyes . They were kneeling , most of the people , and many were crying . A child , a little girl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuttle . He was ashamed and not a little angry that he had forgotten in the height of his prayer . He was cold , that was why he had forgotten . In other years , even when they had had to gather buffalo chips from the prairie , they had kept a better fire in the church . Ida would never have let him out in suchweather with a pain in his back . She would have made him stay in bed with hot bricks around him . He would warm himself a little and then finish his prayer . With one of his long arms he reached out and flipped open the stove door . With the other he reached for the coal scuttle and dumped the contents in . The fire blazed up . " Amen ! " he sang out . " Amen ! " OUR ELDERS BY JASON BOLLES OU and I have seen children make believe 1 That they were old and watched them at their play And hid our laughter in a grown-up sleeve . Now we , no whit more serious than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may Be that when we two sit before the fire , Cheek against cheek , and talk late hours away , Our elders come a-tiptoe and admire ? Gray wraiths of faroff yesterdays ' desire Dead lords and ladies dressed in ancient style  --  Gaze upon you and me and turn their dire Eyes to each other , lips to grim lips smile ?
