Frequent in London lately have been scenes where British stockholders heckled and insulted a management unable to return profits . Last week in London there was another such shocking meeting , more shocking because the stockholders were those of the venerable Hudson 's Bay Co . Ltd. , whose ships have successfully conquered stormy arctic waters for 261 years , whose trappers and coureurs de bois opened the Canadian wilderness . Not successfully did Hudson 's Bay Co. conquer its stockholders ' storm . When the meeting broke up , Charles Vincent Sale was no longer governor . But , eyes flashing , he had said he had a clear conscience , that he had made much money for the company , that he would not lower his dignity by answering the innuendoes against him . More important , when the meeting broke up , Hudson 's Bay Co. seemed likely to suffer a great physical schism . <P> Last month Hudson 's Bay Co. passed its common and preferred dividends . Sir Robert Stevenson Home , onetime Chancellor of the Exchequer , a big stockholder , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it was London-run . He urged that the company 's 14 chain stores in Canada be placed in the hands of a separate company . Canadian-controlled . Governor Sale would have none of this idea . When the meeting assembled , some sulky stockholders urged an amendment providing for the immediate resignation of all directors . This was declared to be " out of order . " Then the stockholders voted to replace three directors , including Governor Sale . Next step will be to sell the Hudson 's Bay stores to Canadian investors , leaving the historic Company engaged only in the fur and land business , and buyer for the Canadian stores .
