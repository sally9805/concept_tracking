The ethos or collective disposition of the U. S. people is dead set against foreign alliances . The fatal smell of 1917 is still too heavy in the air . On the other hand , the U. S. people will buy almost anything - from a piece of the power business to the world 's biggest breadline-and 74% of the citizens canvassed in a recent Gallup poll were eager to buy a big navy , the kind of Big Navy that Franklin Roosevelt asked Congress for two weeks ago . <P> Mr. Roosevelt said he wanted more Navy " specifically and solely because of the piling up of additional land and sea armaments in other countries , in such manner as to involve a threat to world peace and security . " But Mr. Roosevelt has also said that the peace of the world depends on the co-operation of the world 's democracies-i.e. , the U. S. , England and France . In 1916 , the last time so many-nations were at war , Thomas Woodrow Wilson began with a policy of Peace and Preparedness , then took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for Democracy at a total cost to the U. S. of 126,000 lives and $40,000,000,000 . If that was the tragic gamut Mr. Roosevelt was about to embark on , last week the U. S. Senate and House of Representatives wanted to know about it . In the Senate the President 's mouthpiece answered categorically NO ! Before a House committee the answer sounded for a while like maybe . This week Secretary of State Cordell Hull said NO . <P> No . In the midst of a Senate squabble on the Housing Bill , Nevada 's spare Key Pittman , Chairman of the Foreign Relations committee , rose to answer the charge made day before by California 's Hiram Johnson , a fellow committeeman , that the U. S. " had no foreign policy . " Mr. Johnson advanced the theory that the State Department 's protestations of peace were at odds with the President 's threat of " quarantining " aggressor nations . In his Chief 's defense , Senator Pittman declared : " When the President of the U. S. first entered office he announced what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-intervention in the affairs of other governments . I know of no instance so far of that policy being violated . " <P> Hiram Johnson is the Senate 's Great Isolationist . William Borah is its Great Conversationalist . He had heard of Anthony Eden 's pregnant preference to " say nothing " when asked in the House of Commons if Britain and the U. S. were acting in concert after the Ladybird and Panay bombings . He had been even more abashed when the late U. S. Ambassador to Great Britain , Robert W. Bingham , had assured a British audience : " If dictatorships are better prepared to begin war , democracies are better able to finish it . Despots have forced America &; Britain to undertake rearmament , &; having undertaken it , we must necessarily win the rearmament race . "
