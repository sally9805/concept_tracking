" Names make news . " Last week these names made this news : <P> At the initiation of the Hasty Pudding Club two Boston newscameramen set up their tripods in the Harvard Yard , snapped Sophomore Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr . wearing brassiere and panties over the costume of a Pudding initiate . On the edge of a crowd of students Freshman John Roosevelt , youngest son of the President , caught sight of the cameras , demanded the plates of his brother . Refused , he leaped on the back of the nearest photographer , wrested the negatives from the camera , exposed them to the light . Meanwhile the other cameraman was slipping quietly away . Long-legged John raced through the Yard after him , made a flying tackle , hung on until companions caught up and helped him seize the second set of plates .
