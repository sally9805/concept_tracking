ARE you surprised , you masters of the rod , that a fisherman should meekly begin with a title which violates the lofty tradition enshrined in The Comp ! eat Angler of Isaak Walton ? Hear first then my apologia , which shows how wonderfully and in what dark disguise the grace of humility came to abide with one of the brotherhood . I was fishing a stone pile in the Maine wilderness one heavenly summer day when " Tell us more of such fascinating sport , " you interrupt . " We have heard that woodchucks live in stone piles and are hard to catch . What fly were they taking ? " Patience ! I was about to add that , because this particular stone pile was a favorite haunt of minks , I was baitfishing with a grasshopper ; which is not much to my credit . As Andrew Lang truly says , with that generous forbearance which marks the fly-fisherman , " Your bait-fisher may be a good man , but it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my stone pile dated from a time when the best anglers went fishing with a spear . Some ancient landslip had brought it rumbling down to block the course of a spring brook and form a pond in a pocket of the hills . You may still find that pond , as lonely and alluring as ever , between the mighty shoulders of Big and Little Spencer Mountains . From it , as of old , the brook flows northward throughunbroken forest to Sungegarmook ? a picturesque Indian name which by some linguistic lunacy has been translated into " Lobster Lake . " In the Milicete tongue sunge means " fish trap " ; and the root word mock for " water " has such pleasant variations as garmook for " broad water " and murmook for " flowing water " and boommook for " sounding water " or a waterfall . To my disappointment , the unnamed pond offered me no invitation to try my fly rod . Indeed , the water was hardly deep enough to cover the dorsal fin of a sizable trout , as I proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the unworthy habit of an incompleat angler , you know , to carry an axe and a few spikes when going to fish new waters . Originally the pond might easily have floated a whale ; now it was filled almost to the surface by a loose sediment brought down from the forest by the rainwash of ages . No outlet was visible ; but as I wandered over the natural dam a musical gurgle sounded underfoot ; in the bottom of every hole among the stones was a gleam as of liquid ebony . No fisherman could hear that melody of water or see its gleam without thinking : " This is the spot I long have sought , And mourned because I found it not . " In the stream below only small trout could be caught in the summer season ; but these rocky dens near the springhead , everlastingly cool and dark , might well be a hideout for the big ones . This proved to be such a happy thought that I named my stone pile the Wishing Wells . To drop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your wish in the shape of an electric tug . The rub was that such insects as the woods offered for bait must be delicately hooked to remain alive and kicking , as trout like to have them . As you lowered your line expectantly , your heart at your finger tips , the insect would touch water and be snapped off , leaving you only an empty hook . It was like fishing in the Fountain of Youth ; an hour of it would rejuvenate any man . But first one must catch more bait , a whole lot more . In a few tingling minutes I had lost two or three crickets , a grub , a moose fly , and a bumble bee without ever once seeing what took them all so eagerly . If you ask me how very delicately I hooked that bumble bee without getting his hook into me ? well , I did n't . Never again will I trust the rule which says that a bee ca n't sting you if you hold your breath . On a sunny hillside down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbled to mold , its yard upgrown to tall herd's-grass . Going there in search of abundant bait , I sat for a moment on the edge of the clearing to enjoy the blessed stillness . Promptly , as if in answer to my quest , an inquisitive grasshopper lighted on my knee . When I grabbed him as excellent trout medicine , there was an expression on his pointed face which seemed to ask , " Were you never a boy ? " With his question came a memory of days when a slice of bread spread thickly with molasses was a satisfying bonne blanche after school or after chores or before going for the cows , or almost any time between meals . Wondering now whether other insects bad changed as little as I have since the world was young , I held my prisoner in cupped hands while calling through a crack the old , fair terms : " Grasshopper , grasshopper , gimmesome molasses and I 'll let you go . " As quickly and mysteriously as ever , from some hidden reservoir of sweetness he produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite as precious to him , no doubt , as was the room filled with gold which a captive Inca king offered to Pizarro . Yes , he went free , of course ; but I offered no more terms to his clan . In the warm grass of the clearing myriads of grasshoppers were feeding or playing or gaming , or whatever grasshoppers do on their lawful occasions . Some could jump an astonishing distance , and I was no longer a barefoot boy to match their agility . Others had an elfish gift of flight , and these all obeyed the Scriptural injunction , " Rejoice and clap your hands . " As they zipped off with a merry klip-klap of wings , they would turn sidewise in midair , as if to look back and see whether I also rejoiced and clapped my hands . To chase such lively creatures was to remember Falstaff , who said he could not swim but had a great alacrity in sinking ; wherefore I adopted a method which seemed to amuse a whisky jack , or Canada jay , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and knees until I flushed a hopper , I would follow to where he landed from a grand sault and find the suspicious fellow facing me , his legs crooked for another exodus . Only occasionally did I get my hat over one . And very likely , when I put him in my pocket , another that I had thought safely pouched would jump out . Thus silently , whole-heartedly the play went on , until I came to a huge hardwood log hidden in some uncommonly high grass . Over it stood the smiling midday sun ; beyond it the solemn firs seemed to draw nearer , as if to watch the comedy . There was an odor in the close air which should have warned me ; but he who catches grasshoppers must have singleness of mind . Seeing no game afoot , I rose on my knees to brush the grass tops with a hand , thinking that the alarm might start something . And it did . From under my nose a bear that had been sleeping on the other or shady side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in an earthquake that shook down the roof over my head , and in some other chancy situations ; but somehow I ca n't seem to remember anything quite so paralyzing as that bear . Luckily he was scared , too ; and ten times luckily , a bear is never so frightened that he forgets which way to jump for better cover . As he went be let off a terrifying ur-rumph , umph ! like a double-barreled gun . " Do n't you touch me , " he bawled . " Do n't you dare ! " Heaven knows that I had no such intention . In a dazed kind of way I was conscious only of the bottoms of his feet , black and wrinkled , as he turned them up at me so rapidly that they seemed to twinkle through a hurricane of grass . My own feet were rooted meanwhile ; it was only my nerves that twinkled . And the moral was , as you must plainly see , that any merely mortal fisherman needed for his completion a lot of things not mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net to catch grasshoppers , for example , and a cage to put them in . He needed a nosey little dog to run ahead of him , or else high courage or invincible serenity or some other antidote for eruptive bears . And then , when it was all over , he needed a drink . Lacking such essentials , one was bound to get an inferiority complex which permanently disbars him from the company of compleat anglers who look to Isaak Walton as their patron saint . II Any fisherman who sleepily reads The Corn pleat Angler ( and from experience I should say that he ca n't read it without thinking more of his bed ) knows right well that it is about as far from completion as S any book of instruction ever written . Most of its prescribed methods , in fact , are like the collection of junk stored in an old tackle box ; and Diogenes must have seen a tackle box when he exclaimed , lifting up his hands , " Lord , Lord , how many things there are in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what literary critics will say , that The Compleat Angler is to be read not for present instruction but for inspiration and delight . That is true but accidental , and it is not what Walton planned . In his preface he lays capital emphasis on the thesis that angling is an Art not to be attained by men of common capacities , and his constant aim is to make you the uncommon man by teaching you how to attain artistry . Would you catch fish where they are not biting ? Then anoint your bait with marrow from the thigh bone of a heron , and tell the secret to none but honest men . While he thus instructs you how to gn fishing on the moon , Walton has your true artist 's disdain for any practical or newfangled idea . Thus he says of reels ? and one must think of him as winking his left eye - - " Some fishermen use a wheel in the middle of a rod . " As trout rods were then from fifteen to twenty feet long , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like gorillas . Flies also were used in his day ; but he lingers over this piffling method only long enough to quote some venerable notions from a book two centuries old . Of fly-fishing , which is now the very button on the cap of Art , he knew nothing himself , and cared nothing because be thought bait-fishing more pleasing in the eye of heaven . Herein by topsy-turvy logic he is the model for the purist of our own day , who sees only ignorance or bad taste in the use of any other lure than a dry fly . Once , on Horseshoe Pond , I saw and greatly admired one of these purists in action ; and I should tell you that the trout of this spring-fed pond , though small , are so fast as to suggest our latest theory of atoms . The ultimate particles of matter are now supposed to be filled with such inconceivable velocities that a scientist recently announced to a gathering of his kind , " The ' atom disappears in the act of becoming visible . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have considered Horseshoe trout . These acrobats never wait for the act of visibility ; they disappear with inconceivable velocity when they get their cue . Unless you strike , therefore , when you think you see them coming through the greeny-crystal water , you strike only the vacuum created by their disappearance . What held me from my own sport that day ( on the theory that , in one way or another , a fisherman is more interesting than a fish ) was that our dry-fly artist was using a tournament rod to lay out seventy or eighty feet of line at every cast , and that even with a wet fly he was not quick enough to strike trout at half that distance . The wet fly is more deadly , you know , because it is kept moving at the end of a straight line and leader ; while between you and the dry fly is always more or less slack , which must be taken up when you strike . The difference is in fractions of a split second , to be sure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with such electric trout . Ignoring this obvious quality of the fish , our artist was giving me an exhibition of very fine casting and mighty poor fishing . Sharpening his hook on a little file , frequently oiling his fly , dry-casting in the air , changing from fanwing to hackle or nymph , castingtwenty times in the same spot to create ( in the trout mind ) a sudden hatch of insects ? he was going through all the prescribed motions with the religiosity of a choir singing the " Sevenfold Amen " ; but he was catching no fish . All the while the trout were in a mood to make one think , " Doubtless God could have created a better sport than angling , but doubtless God never did . " Like fragments of an exploded rainbow , they would flash up to the old Coachman as readily as to the new Bivisible , and take it merrily and blow it out and be back in their hidden dens before the fisherman could set the hook . What he said to them was not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of Walton 's great discovery . " Trout can hear , " he said ; " wherefore the angler should forbear swearing lest he be overheard and catch no fish . " Though far from being a compleat angler , I have always felt grateful for such instruction ; which is highly moral , you see , with a practical or Benjamin Franklin kind of twist to it . When I am fishing for salmon now , and a sea trout takes my Dusty Miller ( though he should know better ) and bedevils the whole pool before I can quiet his madness , I am careful to speak in whispers when I can no longer hold my tongue . But again I digress lightmindedly , which is the infirmity of fishermen . We were speaking of the lore taught by Isaak Walton , who is a saint to be taken seriously . He tells you , for example , how to act when the desire of years is at last granted ? when you hook the big one , that is , and are fearful that he may break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw your rod into the water and let the fish tow it around until he is tired out , when you can slip the net under him . I trust that every angler will lay this method to heart , even though he may not always like to follow it ; not if his favorite rod is hand-built , like mine , or evokes so many happy memories , or is so tenderly cared for . Once , being without gaff or landing net on a rocky shore , I had to swim a river in order to land a salmon that two hungry men wanted for their supper ; and / remember how carefully at first , and then , when the played-out salmon got his second wind and headed down for the rapids , how rather desperately I tried to keep rod and reel above water . Again , if you are fishing with a minnow , and your bait goes dead , Walton tells you how to give it the appearance of life . Tie it with a short line to the leg of a goose or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is an excellent way to enliven your bait , certainly ; but aside from the commotion , which might alarm a watery world , you may not like to catch a fish by throwing stones at a duck , especially not another man 's duck . The farmer might object . Moreover , though you often meet ducks when fishing , some wild , others more so , you may have forgotten how to go about catching a duck that sees you coming . Still again , this high authority tells you how to allure a pike that has defied the arts of other anglers . First you must catch a frog for bait . When you have him safe , put your hook in at his mouth and out at his gills ; with needle and thread sew up one leg to the shank of your hook , leaving the other free to kick ; and in all his artistry you are enjoined to " use the frog as if you loved him . " Doubtless I ought to be a better man for such instruction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse sympathy goes out to the unwilling bait . There was a time , let me admit , when I caught bullfrogs for bait by dangling a red-ibis fly a few feet in front of their noses , and it was more surprising than to catch a pickerel . For a long minute or two the frog would stare at the bright lure as if hypnotized or dreaming ; in his jewel eye was a far-off look ; through his dream ran the Iow threnody , " Too good to be true ! Too good to he true ! " which he would turn into a bass solo at nightfall . Suddenly , as if galvanized , he would leap from his dream and come walloping over the lily pads to gobble the fly before it could escape . When I hoisted him aloft , his legs would begin to rise and fall rhythmically , left-right , leftright , as if he were ascending an invisible ladder . Only a bullfrog might tell what he was thinking or feeling ; he made me think and feel as if the wrong horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air failed to lift him above his misery , he would raise both forepaws above his head to grasp at the line , as if he were trying in his dumb way to relieve the strain on his hooked lip . And then ? well , perhaps you understand why I quit using a frog as if I loved him . If you must use the creature for bait , do n't put your hook in at his mouth and out at his gills , because , for one reason , he has no gills . There is a better way of harnessing a frog without hooking him ; but I maintain that feather lures are more artistic , and worms or minnows less humanly suggestive in their reactions . Are you wondering why Walton or any other angler should soberly give such absurd instruction ? There are two answers , the first being that he played with luck when he went fishing ; and anyone who would know the rules or methods of luck must consult an astrologer . The second was given by Richard Frank , a Cromwellian with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary criticism of The Compleat Angler which shows any practical knowledge of the subject . Walton , he said bluntly , was a credulous duffer who made a book of fishing " by scribbling and transcribing other men 's notions . " Alas ! that is what our patron saint did , just that . He believed and copied methods which others had recommended sub rosa , as one would whisper a secret . And that is what angling authorities have always done , and probably will do so long as rivers run to the sea and there are fish in the rivers . To read their books in English alone , from the Treatysse on Fysshynge wyth an Angie ( written while Columbus found a new world ) to the latest dissertation on the Dry Fly or the Salmon or the Black Bass , is to find half their pages devoted to notions which were originally proclaimed by soothsayers , and which still live by faith . For example , have you ever read a highly prized book of angling that did not enjoin you to keep a tight line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except when you were happily alone , play a fish five minutes without having the same instruction shouted into your ears ? A score of times when I have been playing a big trout or a salmon some compleat angler has stopped casting to watch me , with pity for my untrammeled innocence it seemed . Invariably when the fish made a lively rim or jump , my mentor would break both silence and neutrality to yell , " Keep a tight line ! Do n't give him any slack ! " For it is a law like that of the Medes and Persians that if you give the fish a bit of slack line he will infallibly eject the hook from his mouth . Once on a New Brunswick river I played the role of guide to a trout fisherman as he played his first seasalmon ; the first , that is , which he had a chance to land . Accustomed as he was to striking sharply when a trout ruse to the fly , he broke the only salmon leader he had , and two of mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fly a moment or two before striking lightly ? oh , very lightly . A trout , you know , commonly takes the fly as he comes up ; a salmon as commonly takes the fly as he goes down , and the plunge of that heavy fish against the upspring of a striking rod is too much for any but a " Crown " leader with a prohibitive price . When I gaffed the neophyte 's salmon he sat down quickly , as if his knees were weak , and gasped , " 1 did n't ? give him ? an inch of slack . " That was all he said , while his eyes feasted on the silvery prize , but be said it with the beatific satisfaction of one who had kept all the law from his youth up . And who would have had the heart to disillusion such a happy lunatic by telling him that more than once his fine had a " bag " in it big enough to enclose a chicken yard ! The odd thing about the angler who thus honors this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many and many a time , after keeping a tight line lest the fish " spit out the hook , " be has had to tug and twist , and scratch his fingers on sharp teeth , and finally use a knife or a disgorger to make that same obstinate hook let go its grip . The precise nature of the power whereby a fish could spit it out does not appear , but it surely must be magical . Often a hooked salmon will rush down half the length of a pool and cut across and up the other side , leaving forty yards of line to worm around in the current before you can reel in the slack or run to get below him . The drag of that line when it " bellies " into a great arch with the pushing salmon at one end and the pulling rod at the other is a thing to fear . Several times it has broken my leader ; never once , as it happens , has it pulled out the hook . To keep your salmon on a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times it is hard to take . Whether your line be taut or easy is of very little consequence . It is true , doubtless , that the constant strain of a tight line will tire a fish more quickly ; but why should you be in a hurry to tire him ? If he be lightly hooked ( as you may know by the feel of his play ) the tighter you keep your line the quicker will he break away . Gently does it . For every fish lost by a loose line , I should say that fifty are lost by an over-tight line . Moreover , when a salmon jumps you always lower the tip of your rod ; not only to give him slack , lest he fall on a taut leader , but more to honor him for the gallant fighter he is , as you dip your ensign to a passing ship . Nevertheless , to the end of my innocent days I expect to hear some compleat angler yell at me when I am playing a fish , " Do n't give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorical imperative and I were a great numskull or the fish a great magician . Again , during the past season one has admired on the covers of our sporting magazines no less than eight gorgeously colored pictures of jumping brook trout . In the course of a lifetime one sees hundreds of such alluring pictures ; and in every ease , as you may remember , the rod is arched as from a heavy strain . It must be our fishermen 's love of the miraculous which bends that rod , since the fish can not bend it by any natural means while he is up in the air . You know very well , likewise , but keep it to yourself lest you spoil another artistic delusion , that brook trout do not jump . Often a big one will swash around on the surface when hooked , and then you should give him plenty of slack , at the same time waving your hat or making some other gesture to drive him below , where he can not hit a taut line with his threshing tail ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout leap clear of the water , as a salmon leaps , or a rainbow trout , or a steelhead . Though my line has been wet in many waters from the subarctics of Canada to the suburbs of New York , only in one small pool and at one short hour have I known a brook trout to go into the air when he felt the pull of a fly rod . This rare exception occurred on a deadwater of the Penobscot , a couple of miles above the old Sourdnahunk dam , While drifting along the shore one August day ( the westerly shore , if you would follow my trail ) I noticed an outgoing streak which proved refreshingly cool to the touch . Tracing it back into the woods , which were here desolate , having been killed by the lumbermen 's accursed dam , my canoe ran into a fisherman 's gold mine where I had expected only a drink of spring water . Some uncommonly large trout had followed up the same cool current , and were resting in a little pool a hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green forest . Fishing this pool was , I confess , too much like fishing a graveyard : all around it stood dead trees , like mournful and reproachful ghosts . It was also a most difficult place for a fly rod , a back cast being impossible . The only effective method was to take the fly in one hand and snap it out by pulling the rod into a bow . Even so , my Parmacheenee Belle had barely touched the water before a three-pound trout rose to it . He was landed , after an unruly fashion , with two more ; and I quit fishing , having enough for one day , while the fish were still in a rising mood . The astonishing thing was that every one of these trout jumped two or three times like a salmon . The largest , which I did not land , rose from under a stub that projected over the pool some eighteen or twenty inches above the surface . When struck he went to the bottom and was with difficulty held from his lair among the roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stub , breaking my leader as his weight fell upon it . Another day I took a few more fish from the same pool ; but they did not jump , nor have I ever again seen a brook trout go into the air at the end of a fishing line . How do I account for the four that did jump ? Used as you are to dream books which magnify the wisdom or wariness of big trout and the skill required to catch them , you will smile at the natural explanation as too simple ? that a fish does not jump to shake out your hook , as the authorities all tell you , for the sufficient reason that he knows nothing about hooks and has no possible way of knowing . He jumps from an unthinking impulse , probably instinctive or hereditary , to get out of the water and let a pursuing enemy pass under him ; and he slats his head or violently wriggles his body for no better or worse reason than you vainly shake your hand when a finger is hurt or vainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , one has frequently seen salmon jumping to escape a seal in tidewater , or pickerel jumping to escape a mink , or minnows jumping to escape a loon or a shelldrake or some other bird that does his fishing under water . I think , therefore , that on a certain lucky day I came to a pool soon after an otter had harried it . His pursuit had awakened some old , half-forgotten instinct in the trout , and they jumped as from a natural enemy when they felt the pull of my artificial rod . You are probably thinking now that you have seen a salmon jump from his pool , where certainly there was no seal to trouble him . So you have . If you will admit the correction , however , he jumped not from his pool but from the stillwater below ; and you may have seen him when he was in sportive mood , or when his eye caught the shadow of a passing insect that was too small or too distant for human eyes to see . I shall , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain brook trout jumped for me , contrary to rule ? wide-awake , that is , if you do not quote the astrological notion of some honored authority , which will surely make me as drowsy as I feel when reading The Compleal Angler after a good day 's fishing . Iv To the incompleat angler , it seems , the finest thing about fishing is that it is so often attended by a spiritual exaltation which comes not from the trout or the trout pool but apparently from on high ; such an exaltation , I fancy , as the unlettered apostles must have felt when they received , most unexpectedly , the gift of tongues . No , I am not speaking mystically or in parables . Every fisherman can remember some such ennobling experience ; but among us all ? and we are now a great multitude ? only Walton has ever given it adequate words . That is why we read and understand and love him , and humor his astrological notions , and call his book of fishing a classic although he was himself an unskilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , " he says ; and we know what he meant and how he felt . Or again , as he recalls a day on a trout stream flowing through English meadows , " When I sat last on this primrose bank and looked down these meadows , I thought of them as Charles the Emperor thought of Florence , that they were too pleasant to be looked on , save only on holy days . " Reading such inspired words , which give us the cream of fishing but have nothing to do with fish , I am somehow reminded of my first trout fly , and of an experience that transformed not only the sober earth but the heavens also at the moment of their afterglow . Near my childhood home was a big pond , with a dam and mill site that dated from pioneer days . It was well stocked with perch , chub , bullpouts , all such coarse fish , as they are called ( though I never saw a fish , save only an imported carp , that was not graceful in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody 's father had once caught a big trout in the millrace . Or was it a string of big trout ? Such rumors grow , like fish , by what they feed on . Into the pond at its forbidding end beyond the woods flowed a sluggish brook , fringed with alders , and bordered by a swamp of bottomless mud into which not even the cattle ventured . From the swamp after dark came bellow lugs that seemed too big for any frog , or the gasping cry of a bird that we did not know was a bittern , or some other eldritch sound which said to every small boy , " Keep out of here . " Several times , on my belated way home from the distant berry pasture , I had seen a swirl and a dimpling of wavelets under the alders , as if the pixies were rowing their underwater boat . Not knowing what else made such swirls , I dismissed them as but another of the mysteries with which the world was then happily filled . Vaguely , as from a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it as I baited for perch or pouts ; but within my horizon there was no flyfisherman to whom I could go for instruction . All I knew , and that by hearsay , was that flies were made of colored feathers . One dull afternoon , being in an idle mood , I resolved to make a fly and try the new way of fishing . The nearest chicken yard offered plentiful feathers ; color was added by the shoulders of a red-winged blackbird , for which I dickered with a boy who was a budding taxidermist . These were tied with thread to a stout hook of goodly size , such as we bought at the grocery store at three for five cents cash or one for an egg in trade . No sooner did my fly begin to assume the appearance of a butterfly that somebody had stepped on than by some occult messagery it suggested those mysterious swirls under the alders . The sun of a September day was then setting ; but what young inventor ever could wait for another day or a more convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair to a line , and the line to a birch pole , I sought the pond at its gloomy end and crossed the swamp by hopping barefoot from tussock to tussock . By day or night the water under the alders ran black as ink ; now at the exquisite twilight hour it was the glass of a heavenly splendor . Of casting I knew nothing , yet somehow the fly was whipped out to float down the sluggish current . The authorities all say that you must fish upstream and must not move the dry fly after it lights ; but they have much to learn , and I was not then troubled by their prohibitions . By twitching the tip of my birchy pole the fly was made to wiggle like a drowning insect , till by a lucky twist it rose and flopped over on its other side . Then up from the deeps rose a gorgeous fish . There was a surge of living color to dim the twilight 's glory ; from the smitten water came a tinkle as of fairy bells ; scarlet spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had ever seen turned back to his den , leaving a swirl that was no longer one of the mysteries . Naturally I tried to derrick him out ; the horsehair snapped , and he was gone . That night I seemed to have the gift of tongues as I ran home , or rather floated as on eagles ' wings , to tell what had come to me under the alders . Certainly , though I knew that I had been lifted above earth , my older brothers could not understand me or else would not believe ; which is the common lot of enraptured fishermen . Though long years passed before I owned a rod that was not made by nature and my jackknife , I was from that inspired hour a fly-fisherman at heart ; not exclusively but , as it were , with the wide tolerance of a musician who hears a symphony by choice , but who walks straighter and longs to do brave things when he hears a brass band . Many trout and lordly salmon have since risen to my lures , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with my first fly . I suppose now that he might have weighed a pound or two ; but what scales can ever weigh a spiritual experience that comes and goes quickly , only to return with its enlightenment and abide with us forever ? V Have I told you anything new about fishing ? If so it was not intentional , believe me . The last thing which an incompleat angler thinks of doing is to make you one of the compleat kind by telling what you must or must not do to catch fish . He knows that it ca n't be done . To read almost any authority on the subject is to remember the saltmaker who came from England to the Plymouth colony . Pretending a great mystery because of his art , he called on the Pilgrims for many trumpery observances and , as Bradford tells us , " made them do many unnecessary things until they discovered his sutletie . " And when the test and thegreat day came , " all he knew was how to boil water in pans " until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so angling , which as an art consists in going where fish are and offering them something to eat . If they take it , you are in luck ; which is nine-tenths of all successful fishing . And the other tenth ? That is about fourfifths keeping your line in the water , which leaves a generous two per cent for skill or artistry or whatever it is that your compleat angler has which your incompleat angler never misses . In sum ? and this is all that any fisherman can tell you ? fishing is not and never was an art of any kind whatsoever ; it does not want or need any exceptional skill ; it has no rules or prohibitions that are not as much honored in the breach as in the observance . Fishing is still , as ever it was , the most artless , the most wholesome , the most childlike and , therefore , the most heavenly recreation to be found in the wide world . It is the one infallible remedy against growing old in spirit ; and whether you start in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits are yours from the beginning . Across the vanished years there comes to the veteran fisherman , when spring returns and he thinks of his day off , the same clear call that lifted him above earth as he ran home from school with the eager question , " Mother , may I go fishing ? " And still there is magic in it , the pure white magic of a boyish heart .
