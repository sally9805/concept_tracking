txt MODES AND MANNERS in so far as they were instrumental in expressing faith . Scholasticism constructed a universe in accordance with preconceived notions ; it saw nature , as Eicken says , only as a great picture-book , destined to illustrate revealed doctrinal truths . True learning may be held to have begun only in the thirteenth century , when men arose who aspired to individual , independent knowledge . In contemporary eyes the English-mane Roger Bacon is the first modern scholar and the origina-tor of scientific empiricism , for he recognized that " without experience one can not know anything sufficiently . " Not until research freed itself from the guardianship of the Church did the world begin to unfold her secrets to newly opened eyes . Natural philosophy , which the Church could no longer sup-press , now arose , producing natural science , which served more than all else to divide the new era from the Middle Ages . 6o THE GREAT MIGRATION Theology had been the one branch of learning recognized and promoted by the Church ; no others were of value unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of Christian physicians medicine was doomed to hopeless bungling with innumerable fatalities ; Arabian and Jewish doctors were the first to advance it . Dissection was prohibited because it " imperilled the resurrection of the body . " Faith looked to a miracle to heal . Medical science , groping in the dark , relied for cures upon extraordinary symbols and mysterious combinations of its often very doubt-ful drugs . The famous medical academy at Salerno , for example , which produced in the tenth century the most sought-after physicians , was no research institute in the modern sense ; its task was to preserve ancient traditions . The writings published by its teachers were based upon old Latin authors whose own texts were simply translations from the Greek . Arabian authors were , it is true , also included within their scope , again , however , only in Latin translations . In contradistinction to astronomy , which was neglected , the pseudo-science of astrology , furnishing the most intimate 6i MODES AND MANNERS correlation between the constellations and human fates , flourished and was busily practised . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In cos-mology St Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus were con-vinced that the earth was globe-shaped ; and the discovery of America at the close of the fifteenth century was not the result of sporting chance , but of thought and research , of an intellectual activity which must certainly have pursued paths of know-ledge outside those indicated by the Church . The poor reception accorded to Columbus by the professors of Salamanca when , at the request of the Spanish monarch , he propounded his ideas to them is well known . They covered the plans of the great dis-coverer with derision and could cer-tainly take no credit for his eventual success . As theology represented the sumtotal of all knowledge and comprised the entire scholarship held in esteem , the direction of all research work was kept in the hands of the Church . With the decay of Roman society perished its literature and culture , the justification for whose existence had vanished together with the communities they represented . The point of contact between pagan forms and Christian ideas was purely superficial , as , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rhetoricians of the old style still kept schools ? at , for instance , Trier , Narbonne , Bordeaux , Autun , and elsewhere . These good men imparted the elements of education to boys through the study of classical authors ; they made them learn by heart and declaim , and instructed them in the rudiments of verse-making and an elegant epistolary style which hinged on trivialities . // They maintained strict discipline and caning seems to have been rife , for Ausonius once in mocking scorn admonished his grandson to fear neither rod , stick , nor leather thong , but to go cheerfully to school . But in the middle of the fifth century , by which time not a single important post in Gaul was occupied by a pagan , the literary use of classical Latin was abandoned , one after another the rhetorical schools dis-appeared and the Roman Church took over the elementary schools . It assumed control of the whole educational system , an act that none disputed .

Imperious demands for an alteration of plan arose , for learning , so it was said , made a man timid and effeminate , and it had never entered King Thcodoric 's head to send Gothic children to school . This prejudice took some time to dispel . The Emperor Otto I , who is known to have spoken German , Saxon , Wendish , and French , did not learn to read till an advanced age , after the death of his first wife , and neither Wolfram von Eschenbach nor Ulrich von Lichtenstein , two noted German poets , could read or write . Charlemagne , who also was interested in this question , would gladly have raised his sub-jects to a higher level of culture ; he even set them a fine example in person by trying ? difficult though he found it  - -  to learn to read and write Latin in his old age ; but he met with no success . In the year 8oz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , again with no result . The Germans viewed with contempt even the most modest mea-sure of education on a scientific basis , and the German nobility have been accused up to the present day of guarding as their most precious , frequently even as the sole , heritage of their forefathers their indifference to learning and art . Thus the clergy , through sheer force of ' circumstance , be-came as a matter of course the custodians of scientific study . For centuries the school was an annex to the monastery . It virtually followed that , as creations of the Church , the schools served only religious ends ? knowledge of the Gospels // forming the essence of their teaching . Nominally the curriculum comprised the seven liberal arts ? the trivium of grammar , rhetoric , and dialectics , and the quadrivium of arithmetic , geometry , music , and astronomy . School discipline was barbarous in its severity , and possibly many a sadistically inclined monastic teacher indulged his passions at the expense of his unfortunate scholars . In Saint-Gall castigation was so im-moderate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monastery . The Church rightly regarded the school as its exclusive property , and hatred of the Albigenses was due in no small degree to the fact that these heretics ' ventured to try to make education compulsory for the laity and to impart it free . In addition to the schools , of which Corvci , Hirsau , Reichenau , and Hersfeld were among the most famous in Germany , the colleges were also in the hands of the clergy . The universities in Paris , Salamanca , Oxford , // and Prague were essentially ecclesiastical institutions . The professorships were held by clergy , and only would-be clergy attended . Paris occupied the foremost place . Any theo logical and philosophical speculations of scholasticism that influenced intellectual development in the Middle Ages were matured in Paris , where among others St Thomas Aquinas taught . The colleges of other countries , even of Italy , ranked far lower than that of Paris . On the other hand , Italy maintained priority with its lay schools , which were superior to those of all neighbouring lands . They communicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian merchants were possi bly the first non-clericals able to write a Latin letter . Considering the marked aversion of the men from intellectual pursuits , it is scarcely sur prising that the arts of reading and writing were all the more readily taken up by women . In Gaul girls learned to read and write in the early sixth century ; Queen Radegunde , wife of Clotaire I , founded at Poitiers a nunnery where the pupils were even taught to act . St Boniface founded the nunnery at **26;792;TOOLONG as a model institute for // German girls , and with great tact obtained a Mother Superior from England ; he knew the Germans , who were no different from those of to-day . Charlemagne too set an example in the education of girls by having his daughter taught not only the customary handicrafts of weaving , spinning , and cmbroidery , but reading and writing as well . Women continued to practise these accomplishments with zeal . The Empress Matilda , when widowed by the death of the Emperor Henry I , learned to read and write and insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early Middle Ages Germany boasted more than one learned woman and owes her first encyclopaedia to a bluestocking .

Not until a later period did the contempt for women on the part of the Church , which was entirely consistent with the sex-valuation placed on women by the clergy , cause the education of girls to be neglected . In a work written at the time of King Philip the Fair Francesco Barberini raised the question whether it was advisable to have one 's daughters taught to read and write , and answered it with a categorical no. // THE DAWN OF GERMANIC CIVILIZATION THE Germans who came to seek new homes in the Roman Empire were one and all free men . They belonged to no firmly knit political union , and knew as little of national unity as of subordination to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they obeyed only for a definite time and for the attainment of definite ends . This lack of discipline gravely impeded their political development , prevented all united and consistent co-operation , and gave the Roman element the upper hand . The bond between the Germanic tribal king and his followers was very loose , and the relationship should not be visualized as one of subjects and king . It was a bond of mutual obliga-tions and loyalty . The followers who composed the retinue of a prince were and remained free even in relation to him , and it was always doubtful whether he would be able to depend upon them in all eventualities . Not until the time of Charlemagne was the transition effected from the lack of discipline of the ancient Germans to the Feudal System , with its pledge heavily safeguarded on both sides . The Feudal System impressed its stamp on the whole of the Middle Ages and permeated every aspect of the State . It was based on the legal precedent that the owner of an estate assigned the usufruct to a third party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he then , on the contrary , assumed the liability to render either certain services or dues to the feudal lord . The acceptance of a tenure established between feudal lord and vassal a condition of allegiance , a breach of which was regarded as a serious crime . The system was steadily extended and greatly assisted in weakening the unity of State power . New grades were continually inter-vening between the king and the freemen , so that finally // they lost all direct contact with one another . In the year 1037 a law provided that the vassals of spiritual and temporal lords could hold their land in hereditary fee that is to say , they could treat it as their own property except that it might not be sold and that for lack of a male heir it fell to the feudal lord . From this time onward also dates the custom of giving in hereditary fee not only landed property , but posts ? a practice which resulted in a steady decline of the supre-macy of the Crown . In the Middle Ages the whole State was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by absolutism . Down to the time of Charlemagne the common freemen ? that is to say , a land-owning middle class ? constituted the bulk of the population , but the efforts of this far-seeing ruler to maintain that class were in vain , and it succumbed to the 70 . THE DAWN OF GERMANIC CIVILIZATION burdens of the military service for which it was liable . The small estates passed inevitably into the hands of the Church and the big landed proprietors . For the sake of bare subsistence the small owner had to resort to dependence upon clergy and nobility ; he surrendered his property in order to receive it again indirectly in fee . Necessity made former freemen villeins and very soon serfs . But as monarchical power lost in prestige there arose over the freemen a gentry class , sprung from retainers and high officials . The counts and margraves rose from the rank of administrative officials to be hereditary proprietors ; whereas Charlemagne had deposed the tribal dukes from their positions of authority , under the Hohenstaufens , his weak successors , Guelphs , Wittelsbachs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized by the Emperor Frederick II as independent sovereigns . Kingly power bowed down to them , since it could not rule them . The retainers . ( ministeriales ) of the big landowners became mediate nobles who , when provided with tenures , became powerful enough to oppose the Crown . The kingdom of Charlemagne had stretched from the Pyrenees to the Elbe and from Rome to the Eider ; when his sons partitioned it they not only crippled the idea of the universal divine State in which the ruler exercised both priestly and temporal power , but broke the very spine of the German Kingdom . Otto I endeavoured , by restoring the Roman Empire , to bring the Christian Occident once more under united rule , and through the strength of a great idea to weld humanity into a whole . But while he was fighting the pagan and uniting Italy with Germany the The power of the German Kingdom , which formed the German nucleus of the world-embracing empire , waned . Kingdom The Emperors pursued Utopia , squandering and dissipating // their forces in warfare which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of succession , but the Royal House had to renounce its claim to an hereditary crown . A united monarchy , the dearest aim of all nations in the Middle Ages , could not materialize in Germany because the German kings had invested the terri-torial lords with a power against which they themselves were impotent . The assemblies of princes became national Diets , which very soon started to enact laws instead of confining themselves to taking counsel . Single rule by the king was stifled under the multiple rule of the princes . The intensity with which the Imperial policy of foreign conquest aggravated national antagonisms between the various // peoples undoubtedly helped to defeat the German efforts toward unity . Regard was first had to the question of national character when the kingdom was partitioned among the sons of Louis the Pious , and the dissimilarity between nations was fully recognized . The link between the Romanized West Franks and the Germanized East Franks was irrevocably severed , and the way paved for the formation of the French monarchy , the kingdom of Germany , and that ever-contested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by German and Gallic people , comprised Lorraine , Bur-gundy , and the Low Countries . Languages parted company , and mentalities became distinct . Each nation withdrew into itself and developed its individual failings and peculiarities into points of national honour . Nothing contributed more to the fostering of national hatred than the Crusades , which were organized as joint undertakings of the entire Christian world . Antagonisms were so sharply defined that even in the First Crusade Godfrey de Bouillon had continually to mediate between Germans and French , who would rather have attacked each other than the infidels . This antipathy only increased , and in the later Crusades assumed such intolerable forms among the Germans , English , and French that success was imperilled . The armies which had set off so harmoni-ously returned home bitter enemies , and the princes were the richer by an expedient for adducing patriotism ' as a basis of future policy whenever this suited them . National antagonisms , which spring from the worst characteristics of peoples ? ignorance , envy , vanity , and conceit ? have never been stilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first and most strongly developed in France , a certain justification for whose national vanity can not be denied . It must in all truthfulness be ac-knowledged that as early as the Middle Ages French culture possessed some very attractive features , and that neither chance nor unworthy imitative zeal can account for its emulation by other nations than Germany . This was in some measure due to the fortunate circumstance that langue d'oc , which was spoken in Provence , was understood in the rest of France and in Italy and Spain , and thus represented a factor of culture and civilization with which acquaintance could readily be made . In England all official documents were drawn up in French until 136o ; Brunetto Latini , the Florentine , wrote his Tresor in French because this language was the most customary and convenient . About the year 1200 the Italians and Catalonians wrote // in the Provencal tongue , and if at this period the small courts of the Southern French counts set the fashion the reason may be found in the intellectual influence France exerted by their beaux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetters of ecclesiastically directed thought is always ascribed to the Italian Renaissance , but even if the beginning of this movement may be traced as far back as Dante , the balance of credit is without doubt considerably on the side of the troubadours . It was they who , by the glorification of sensuous love , endowed life with the first romantic clement , thus striking an entirely modern note . At a time when the aim was to associate everything with heaven they made sheer human sensibility the vital principle of their world . The widespread influence they exerted suffices to show the high degree in which they thereby satisfied the spiritual needs of // their fellow-creatures . As early as the twelfth century French lyrics and epics had started on their triumphant course through the world , and by the thirteenth century had nothing left to acquire , but only the need to hold their ground . At the court of the Emperor Frederick II at Palermo Sicilians , Germans , Greeks , Arabs , Lombards , and Normans held intercourse with one another in the French tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the elcmen- // tary knowledge of reading and writing , spoke French , and in the German courts , which held themselves in some esteem , the French tutor was already , in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , quite a familiar figure . At the close of the thir-teenth century we find Hugo von Trimberg ridiculing the frequent journeys to Paris . The conventionalities of refined society in respect of style and manners , social intercourse , morals , fashions , and speech originated in France , chiefly for the reason that Paris was the seat of all culture . None of the other Western nations ? neither Germany , England , Italy , nor Spain ? possessed a centre of culture , let alone a capital of such intellectual standing as Paris could lay claim to be . Erwin Rosenthal rightly remarks that the victory of the West had its birth in the Ile de France . Later on we shall see that France also took the lead in regard to new modes of expres-sion in art , which the other nations were at pains to emulate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influence upon foreign nations at that time was not such a simple matter , for communication between them , if not absolutely impossible , was at all events beset with great difficulties . When Otto von Freising , for instance , men-tions the English and French , or even the Flemish and Lorrainers , he calls them " totally unknown people . " The Roman Empire had boasted a most excellent network of roads , with Rome as the centre of the main arteries , but during the devastations caused by the great migration they had fallen into complete disrepair , and nobody felt responsible ? even assuming that it was within their power for the reconstruc-tion of the roadways and bridges . Travel overland was dangerous and rare ; it was never undertaken for pleasure and very seldom for purposes of enlightenment . Apart from travelling for commercial purposes , the only practicable form of journeying was the pilgrimage . Pil-grimages were already familiar to the Jewish and Germanic tribes , and were continued by the Christians , who always yearned to perform their devotions at the places where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the close of the fourth century pilgrimages had // already attained such dimensions and were accompanied by such extraordinary incidents that the Fathers of the Church protested strongly . They only increased in number , however ? chiefly by reason of their imposition on sinners as a penance for grievous sins . In the year 1064 , for instance , a great pilgrimage took place in which seven thousand persons participated , of whom only two thousand found their way home . From mass gatherings of this nature to the armed pil-grimages we call the Crusades was really only a step . Ever since Palestine had fallen into the hands of the Seljuks in the year io76 serious difficulties had accompanied the pilgrimages , and the Pope might well regard it as his duty to effect a change in these conditions through the agency of the Christian monarchs . At the Council of Cler-mont , sitting from November 18 to 27 , 1095 , Pope Urban II inaugurated the Crusade movement , which blazed up with violence and which , although it gradually died down , kept the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecclesiastical , political , and economic aims . The French knights championed this cause with fierce zeal ; half-heartedly , impelled rather than impelling , the Germans followed suit . So many diverse motives contributed to the materialization of the total reckoning of seven Crusades that it would be difficult to determine which of them finally proved decisive . The prime mover was the Church , which , since it could liberate a movement embracing well-nigh the entire Occident , was justified in experiencing the rapture of a world-ruler . At the time of the first Crusades , indeed , the Roman Catho-lic Church had attained the zenith of its power . It controlled the fate of the Western World , moulding its ideas and direct-ing its course . Although the ascetic spirit underlying these campaigns should not be underestimated , it was accompanied by so many and such powerful material motives that their union was essential before the mighty impetus required for the great deed could be released . The eternal bliss assured by helping to deliver the Holy Land certainly implied great // the Church could never succeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reached the height of its power with the Crusades ; thereafter its path led downhill . Italy , the home of the Curia , took the smallest share in the Crusades , and reaped the greatest advantages from them . The armies were carried by the fleets of the Genoese , Pisans , and Venetians , whose owners took care to exact good money . A knight with two retainers , a horse , and a stable-boy paid ? i7 sterling for the passage , this charge including the provisioning of the whole party . In the year 1268 St Louis paid the Genoese ? 25,000 as ships ' hire , and the purchasing power of money at that time is known to have been incomparably greater than now . ( These sums denote I9I4 value . ) The pilgrimages and Crusades brought wealth to the Italian maritime towns , and had they only refrained from whittling away their strength in mutual jealousies they would have prospered far more . The lead had been taken by Amalfi , in regard to the size , population , and shipping of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie and formation of the coast is taken into account . Pisa destroyed the maritime power of this small republic , only to be robbed of its own fleet by Genoa a century and a half later . Genoa succumbed to the rivalry of Venice , which maintained its dominion the longest . The latter enjoyed the enormous advantage of a despotic but stable government , and was one of the Powers which deprived the Curia of all possibility of political control . The motto " Siamo Veneziani poi Christiani " ( " We are first Venetians , then Christians " ) spared Venice all conflict between reason and conscience , and permitted it the undeviating pursuit of its material interests . Compared with those of to-day , the fleets of the Middle Ages were modest equipments ; a single large modern sea-going steamship would probably cover the total tonnage of all the Italian maritime Powers of that time . The oar still preponderated , the tonnage rarely exceeded from ten to a hundred tons , and ships of two hundred or maybe five to seven hundred tons were considered gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level with the undeveloped state of shipbuilding ; as late as the fifteenth century a Venetian fleet was seventy-seven days under way between the home port and Con-stantinople . Piracy flourished apace , and provided the Turks with the means to make themselves feared far and wide . They kept the whole of the Mediterranean in a state of terror just as the heathen pirates from the north commanded the Baltic before the rise of the Hanse . The original purpose of the Crusades was not achieved : the Holy Land could not be permanently wrested from the F 8i MODES AND MANNERS infidel . Even the states founded on the occasions of these warlike musters were destined to but an ephemeral existence . The Latin Empire in Byzantium , the feudal duchies on the classic soil of ancient Hellas , dissolved like dreams before the morning sun . The nobles and knights who sacrificed their all to the cause were the greatest sufferers . They shared a similar fate to that of the promoter , the Church . In one stupendous effort of body and soul they rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast the subsequent abrupt descent . The majority of those who took the Cross , and who in most cases remained away for years , on return found their affairs in disorder , their property neglected , their authority undermined . Vast numbers fell vic-tims to epidemics or exhaustion , or succumbed to the enemy . The family received no news , the succession was disputed and doubtful , disorganization was inevitable , all the more so 83 because of the complete transformation effected in the eco-nomic system through the Crusades . The agrarian system hitherto prevailing was supplanted by finance ; the merchant competed with the landowner . The day of the towns had come . The nobleman waxed poor , the civilian rich . The German urban system is likewise a Roman importa-tion . The Germanic tribes were no lovers of town life ; the earliest urban settlements on German soil were the military camps established by the victorious Roman invaders . Thus on the Rhine arose Strassburg , Speyer , Mainz , Coblenz , Cologne , and Utrecht ; on the Danube Augsburg , Ratisbon , Passau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imperial residence . All were crowded with magnificent buildingspalaces , theatres , villas , and baths ; and if to-day modest remnants furnish the sole trace of all this bygone splendour the blame rests with the Huns . Their devastating hordes burned down the Rhenish towns , frequently with such radical and permanent success that Strassburg , for instance , became in the sixth and seventh centuries a waste inhabited only by wild animals . Nor were Merovingians and Carolingians partial to towns ? they in-finitely preferred residence at their country Palatinates ; that Aachen rejoiced in the patronage of Charlemagne was due to its hot springs . The first urban foundations attributable to German initiative are contemporary with the need for expansion which bore German arms eastward . In order to consolidate , as it were , the conquests he had made on Sla-vonian soil , Henry I planted at Quedlinburg , Merseburg , and Goslar strongholds which forthwith became the nuclei // of more towns . The general insecurity of life and property was conducive to the growth of settled places in which the citizens were equally safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own masters . It was not long before the inhabitants of each town , linked together into a free community , experienced a feeling of unity , became conscious of their power , and often openly opposed their lords , were they Imperial burgraves or bishops . The royal Palatinate towns made the most rapid strides toward independence , and gradually became free Imperial cities . The growth of the urban system began earliest in Italy , whose burghers held their heads so high that they did not hesitate to oppose Emperor and Skate . They never conceded that Italy was more than temporarily subservient to the Germanic Emperor , and if decisive success was not their lot this must be ascribed to the party spirit which not only roused Guelphs and Ghibellines against their neighbours in every city , but pressed a weapon against his fellow-burgher into the hand of every burgher in every town . The German towns such as Ulm , Augsburg , and Nurem-berg , which prospered through their commercial connexion with Venice , or such as Vienna , Passau , and Ratisbon , which carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Danube , or , lastly , such as Bremen , Hamburg , and Danzig , which maintained shipping with the North and the // West , soon learned to transform their wealth into political power . They acquired in the internal policy of the kingdom an influence which they knew how to render effective and permanent by means of mutual alliances . The Rhenish and Swabian confederations bear witness to the energy and inde-pendence with which the German towns protected themselves in a period of wild anarchy . The Hanse in particular gradually developed from a league originally consisting of Baltic port towns concerned in the suppression of piracy into a comprehensive federation of commercial centres , and at its most flourishing stage comprised some ninety towns between Reval and Amsterdam , Cracow and Cologne . The Emperors , although unable to protect the towns , pro-hibited them from employing this method of self-defence , but they could not stem the movement . Through mutual co-operation trade and commerce assumed in the towns propor-tions which completely altered the aspect of economic life . Handicrafts and agriculture began to part company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . The towns , with their persistent industry , bustle , and stir , knew how to amass wealth against which traditional views were powerless to assert themselves . Money entered the arena and revolu-tionized everything . In no other sphere did the Church miss its mark in such degree as in that of finance . It regarded real estate , which supplied a standard for all values , as the only justifiable basis of national economy . The taxpayer had to fulfil in kind his obligations to the Church , the State , the feudal lord , and the community . He had to pay in cattle , fowl , grain , eggs , cheese , but not in money . As all private and public business was associated with the possession of landed property , endeavours were made to take the real value of commodities as the basis of a system of price-control under which prices would be fixed once and for all without regard either to harvest-yields or the adjustment of supply and demand . Decrees of this nature were issued by Charlemagne , Frederick I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this movement , the merchant 's calling was // discredited , for the Church regarded pure financial transactions as a trespass against God and forbade the charging of interest on loaned-out capital . Charlemagne actually considered it usury for the seller to ask more for a commodity than he had paid for it . Such stringent views could naturally not be enforced in civil life , and , notwithstanding the pains to which the Church went to preserve the system of payment in kind , it could not prevent money from holding its own as a medium of exchange . The Church was struggling against a natural law of economy , just as Don Quixote tilted against the windmills . The Crusades , which furthered the production of goods and promoted commerce and trade , showed that the system of payment in kind had had its day ; thereafter com-mercial dealings were based solely on money . " Money will be emperor , money rules , money reigns , money sits in judgment , " laments an unknown Latin author as early as the latter half of the eleventh century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure of circumstances // created by the Crusades . The Florentine bankers used to take something like 20 to 40 per cent. , which corresponded approximately to the profits Venice made from trade with the Levant . As business increased in volume money decreased in value , as shown by the fall in the rate of interest , which was i o per cent . in the thirteenth century , and fell to 5 per cent . at the beginning of the fourteenth . This was the time of the first great banking institutions in Italy . They were essential for the negotiation of the forced loans which the Italian communes had been obliged to impose on their citizens . In order to acquire some idea of financial conditions in the Middle Ages , it must be borne in mind that at the turn of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ? 5 possessed the purchasing power of ? zoo in 1914 . At the beginning of the fifteenth century the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order residing at Marienburg was giving his veterinary surgeon a yearly stipend of 1os. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 1 and the physician-in-ordinary ? 1 Ios . In 1437 ? 38 the Imperial Councillor Konrad von Weinsberg purchased a horse for 5 guldens and sixteen head of cattle // for 43 . He had to give 8 gulden for a pound of cinnamon and 6 for a pound of saffron , while 4. cwt. of butter cost him 17 . In 1476 the Margrave John of Brandenburg paid to a man who served him with horses 25 gulden a year , or only 20 if he was not mounted . On the reckoning of his father , the Elector Albert Achilles , he could , by restricting his retinue to a hundred men and a hundred mounts , meet the entire expenditure of his court with 10,000 gulden a year , without needing to incur debt . According to statistics compiled by G. von Buchwald , the daily wage in Wages Holstein in the fifteenth century was so high that a workman could earn in three to four days the price of a lamb , in six to seven that of a sheep , and in three weeks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one working-day in the princi-pality of Bayreuth would buy 9 lb. of the best beef , and in Austria 7 lb. of ox-flesh . At Aachen a day-labourer could earn a sheep in six days . Money helped the towns to assume an authoritative position in economic life , for only there could capital be earned , invested , and increased . The territorial // lords looked on with envious eyes and did what they could to obstruct the trade of the hated burghers . This they achieved by the high duties they placed on the transport of goods . Every little dynast fixed what dues he pleased . There were outside the gates of Nuremberg , for instance , twenty-four customs-houses within a radius of three miles . An Elbe ship-master had to pay dues for a free passage at three places between Magdeburg and Tangermunde and at seventeen between Magdeburg and Hamburg . A four-horse convey-ance crossing the Elbe at Pirna in the year 1376 paid two-pence ferriage , and yet the cost of a bushel of oats then was only fivepence . Customs dues along the Rhine became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strassburg summarily stopped traffic on this waterway in 1351 , and for two years permitted no shipping to ply either up-stream or down . Every urban community was at that time an entirely independent economic unit , and found connexion with its neighhours irksome and onerous . Furthermore , the burghers were already in principle bitterly opposed to the ruling powers represented by the Church and the feudal aristocracy . In the eyes of the Church all possession was essentially wrong , for with the discovery of property began all evil on earth . " He whose possessions exceed his needs possesses the property of others , " declares St Augustine ; and St Thomas Aquinas concurs when he writes , " According to natural law , there is no distinction of property . " Cesarius of Heisterbach ventures the assertion that " Every wealthy man is either a thief or the heir of a thief , " and even if such standards did not prevent the clergy from hoarding tangible earthly treasure , they had nevertheless to hold good for laymen .

So vexations beset go THE DAWN OF GERMANIC CIVILIZATION the towns on every side , and this explains why in the general insecurity that prevailed they cast about for a higher law than mere force . Ancient Germanic law rested on the principle of self-protection ? a state of affairs bound to lead to trouble , since ideas of right and wrong differ so greatly . " Might is right " was the maxim , and not in Germany alone . The so-called Truce of God of 1 o83 which the Church established aimed at enforcing peace on certain weekdays , and also indicated definite places and persons to be excluded from hostilities for all time . In disputed cases the legal duel or the ordeal decided the truth . So small was the regard paid to the sanctity of an oath that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain a decision .

Intense though the opposition of the Church was to this view , in which it perceived a presumptuous challenge to God , the duel and the ordeal remained for centuries the principal means of decision when difficulty was experienced in administering justice . To this the Swabian and Saxon Codes ' bear testimony . Duelling was only permitted between freemen ; a superior need not accept the challenge of an inferior , but opponents might decide to have the matter fought out by hired combatants . This was usually done in the case of female defendants when they did not care to appear in person . If a duel of this // nature actually arose between a man and a woman he was placed in a pit up to his hips , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right was placed a strong cudgel ; the woman was allowed to tie a stone of a pound weight in her sleeve and to fight with that . If the man won he had the right to have the woman buried alive . The legal duel was employed in high places too . In 1283 King Peter of Aragon challenged King Charles of Anjou to single combat of this nature , to take place at Bordeaux , then in the hands of the English . Each monarch was to be accompanied by a hundred knights , and the issue of the fight was to be accepted as a judgment of God . But the French sovereign deemed it wiser not to trouble the Almighty ! The ordeal rested on a similar principle ? that God 's omnipoThe tence would deliver Ordeal the innocent even when he was in the utmost danger from man . Women were the chief persons exposed to it , frequently for very trivial reasons . In the water test if the woman who was cast into the water floated she was held to be guilty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far more dangerous . The accused woman must either carry a red-hot iron nine paces , or walk barefoot over nine to twelve red-hot ploughshares , or plunge her arm to the elbow in boiling water and ' fetch out a stone . If she blistered her guilt was established . Sometimes the woman was compelled to walk through fire , or was dressed in a shift soaked in wax , which was ignited ; to prove her innocence she must remain unharmed. // When the Church began to concern itself with the law it endeavoured to establish in the Kingdom of God upon earth equality before the law , for at its judgment-scat , as at that of God Himself , all men , without regard to their social status , were to be held equal . The interference of the clergy in all civil judicial matters only confused jurisdiction , for the spiritual judge was at great pains to call all possible offences before his tribunal . In contrast with the innumerable national laws , variously framed and administered , and with the obtru-sive ecclesiastical law , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great achievements of Roman civilization must be reckoned the fact that the Romans were the first to recog-nize that the conditions of society created by human will ? marriage , property , the family , and social intercourse ? bore within themselves the law of inalienable fitness . These re-quirements of everyday life were found crystallized in the prescriptions of Roman law in terms which could not have been more precisely formulated and which laid down that acquired right was the inviolable foundation of society . Under Justinian the law was codified , and it remained valid among the indigenous races even after the Germanic tribes had settled in their midst . The more inade-quate the native law of the latter , differing radically in the various tribes and towns , the more urgent was the necessity for a system whose formulas could be applied to contingencies reaching beyond local limitations . The feudal law which obtained in the late Middle Ages complicated and confused jurisdiction , for it was quite a usual phenomenon , and one that in some places even persisted right down to the early part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to belong to several lords by virtue of several titles . Tenures and mortgages played their part in producing the hopeless en-tanglement of incidental legal questions . Although Roman law had never quite fallen into desuetude , it was not actually revived until the time of the Crusades , when communication improved , and increased traffic combined with awakening spiritual activity to make greater claims , among other things , 93 ' MODES AND MANNERS on the law . It received an external impetus when the Emperor Frederick II converted his kingdom of Sicily into a bureaucratic State at a time when feudalism and vassalage still ruled elsewhere . In place of the high nobility and prelates he summoned lawyers to his chancery and his council . Theirs soon became the leading profession , and acquired in political , social , and intellectual life an influence that has been long and loudly deplored and did not help to gain friends for the " baneful caste of national scourges . " Scholarly training the lawyers received at Bologna , which in the // twelfth century had reached the height of its fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers and students of all nationalities . Roman law as interpreted by jurists of Italian nationality acquired universal validity and increasing authority . The Saxon Code , drafted about the year 1230 , was still independent of Roman law , but the Swabian Code , drafted some forty years later , showed distinct traces of its influence . The convincing logic of its clauses has contributed in no small degree to the success of this law , but the fact that it was essentially a system which favoured 95 the prince also helped to smooth its way . When the learned lawyers began to try to apply Roman law in Germany , where circumstances , customs , and economic conditions were essentially different , they encountered violent opposition from a people who , unlike the Romans , had not been excluded from all participation in the framing of the law . Roman law never actually succeeded in eliminating the Germanic ? at all events , not in cases where Robber- the law of self-protecknights tion , " Might is right , " promised better results , which under the legal conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages . " Germany , " writes Philippe de Comynes in his memoirs , " teems with mountain fastnesses and robber-knights , who on the slightest excuse provoke a dispute , commit acts of violence , plunder , rob , and steal . If a man has only himself and his squire to consider , he at once delivers a challenge to a city or to a duke , that he may with greater ease lead his life of robbery in the stirrup . " The story told of Burckart von Ehingen , one of the ancestors of Georg von Ehingen , in the latter 's autobiography , is characteristic of the views held in this respect . Burckart was in the service of Count Eberhard of Wurttemberg , who ultimately came to owe him a large sum of money with no prospect of repayment . To cut the story short , Burckart von Ehingen captured two lords and " relieved them of the whole sum Count Eberhard owed him , and , to ensure their safety , sent them both to the Count with a safe conduct and a receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundred gulden . " A pretty state of affairs ! At the Diet of Worms in 1495 Maximilian I suc-ceeded in extracting from the nobility a pledge to renounce the use of arms in the settlement of their disputes , but this concession held good on paper alone . Mention need only be made of Franz von Sickingen , Gotz von Berlichingen , and other personalities of that epoch who have become national heroes , to realize that the maxim " Might is right " was not to be set aside by Imperial edict . Not until the fifteenth century did the learned lawyers suc-ceed in applying Roman law in a manner , however , that looked deplorably like a brutalization of justice . They had no further use for legal duel or ordeal , but since they desired to obtain the confession of the evil-doer , they resorted in all cases in which persuasion proved useless to coercion . The rack made its entry into Germany , accompanied by barbarous methods of punishment based on the principle of retaliation and designed to terrorize . With the assumption of Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death-sentences , increased . Between 1366 and 1400 executions in Frankfort-on-the-Main numbered 155 ; between 1401 and 1500 they totalled 317 . The year 1413 marks the first mention of the rack in this city ; free play was therewith provided for the fertile imagination of execu-tioner and judge . As long-term imprisonment for common criminals was unknown , they were released when the trial was over ; but not until either hands , feet , nose , ears , or tongue had been cut off . Knocking in of teeth , putting out of eyes , or other mutilation were regarded as mild punishments ; the lightest was branding on brow or cheek . Persons of quality were executed by beheading , and could claim regard for their rank . At Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1420 Bertram von Vilbel was beheaded on a black carpet , and at Valladolid Constable Don Alvaro de Luna was put to death on a costly tapestry . Persons of lesser rank were hanged , frequently by the legs , and left swinging so close to the earth that they were devoured , often alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , for example , did King Philip the Fair MODES AND MANNERS deal with three hundred Parisian citizens whom he caused to be strung up before their own homes . In torture by the wheel the miserable victim had all the bones of his extremities fractured , and he was then bound on a wheel , upon which for three days he wrestled with death . The medieval sense of propriety forbade that a woman should die on the gallows , but she could be burned alive , drowned , or interred or impaled alive ; this did not shock the susceptibilities . Female poisoners and child-murderers were torn to pieces by four horses . In the punishment of political offenders thirst for revenge knew no human bounds . The Emperor Henry VI had the rightful heir to the Sicilian throne blinded and mutilated , and then left to perish miserably in the dungeons of German fortresses . His adherents were im-paled and burned alive at Palermo , and on the head of one // of them whom the Emperor feared as pretender was nailed with iron nails a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to meet . Germany , however , was by no means the leader in bestial cruelty of punishment ; the Italians put the Germans quite in the shade . To the manifold torments they devised for their political antagonists in the wars of the cities Dante 's executioner 's imagination bears eloquent testimony , for in the picture of hell that he depicts he positively wallows in horrors . The English once had seventy Irish prisoners beheaded by a peasant girl , so that the clumsiness of the unwilling executioner might prolong the sufferings of the condemned . Leo von Rozmital and his travelling companions were spectators at Olmedo , on Spanish soil , of a burghers ' 99 shooting-match in which a condemned criminal served as target and so met his death . The Fehme may be regarded in the light of a protest against the alien Roman law with its tendency to excesses in the conduct of trials and the inflicLion of punishment .

The centre of jurisdiction , the so-called Freistuhl , was always at some well-known and accessible spot , the most noted of them being at Dortmund .

Persons accused by the Fehme were granted a period of grace within which to clear themselves ; if they denied the charge a trial with witnesses was in stituted in regard to which all the participants had to swear the strictest secrecy . Neither the rack nor punish ments of particularly subtle cruelty were employed ; if the accused was found guilty the gallows was his reward . If he chanced to be caught by three associates ' they hanged him without further ado and left a dagger sticking in the tree on which they had strung him . The four letters S. S. G.

" There were at that time in Germany innumerable associates of this secret court , who recognized one another by means of mystic signs . Even the Emperor Sigismund had himself enrolled in 1429 . IOI CHAPTER III THE AGE OF CHIVALRY CHIVALRY was the institution which gave the Middle Ages its pre-eminently characteristic stamp . Justice can not easily Chivalry be done to the subject in a few words . Chivalry was a peculiar kind of spiritual and physical organization , a frame of mind and at the same , time an athletic training , a philosophy as well as a superior social standing , and finally ? when it was long since a thing of the past ? an idealistic dream . Above all things ? to dispel a widespread error ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not interdependent ; a knight might be a noble , but this was not essential . Medieval chivalry arose out of the martial state always held in such high esteem by Germanic races . Free , ablebodied young men , glorying in their arms , gathered round chosen leaders whose prestige lay in physical strength and in a talent for leading their followers in time of war to fame , honour , and booty . In earlier days this military service was a foot service , and it underwent no radical change until , in the eighth century , the Franks adapted their military constitution to cavalry . Infantry then suffered a loss of prestige , while that of the mounted warrior was correspondingly enhanced by reason of the higher costs of his service , which could only be contemplated by the well-to-do . So the necessary qualification for mounted service produced a picked body of men , the riders or knights , who had no need to be of noble birth to make their way . It is true that in Germany the sons of clergy and peasants were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not prevent even bondmen from rising to eminence through sheer ability . When in due course the former middle class of freemen sank into a state of increasing bondage , thereby relinquishing or forfeiting the right to arms , // the prestige of the knight increased steadily . The last step was then taken in the system of hereditary tenure by making the calling of chivalry hereditary too , thereby creating a new pro-fessional class . Conscious of his infinite superiority to the tradesman , the craftsman , the peasant , and the clergy , the knight forthwith entrenched himself behind lofty and welldefined barriers of professional honour and morality , destined to keep the outsider at a distance . Now for the first time value was placed upon birth and descent , and formalities were instituted which made knightly rank difficult of attainment . Not every aspirant could be a knight , for the great physical exertion to which he must be equal pre-cluded this possibility . A parallel to the seven liberal attainments of the student was furnished by the seven chivalrous accomplishments in which the knight must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates . These were riding , swimming , archery , wrestling , hawking , chess , and verse-making , apart from which he must be able to wield the sword and sustain the shield . All this could not be learned in a moment ; only long practice could make perfect . A boy 's training and educa-tion therefore commenced at a tender age . He must already be familiar with the elements of thAse arts when , at the age of twelve , he entered a princely court or the house of a // knight . If he wished to succeed in life his principal accomplishments must be riding and fencing , for upon these his future depended . When a page at court had mastered all that was required of him he became a squire , accompanied his 104 . THE AGE OF CHIVALRY master to battle , and fought at his side . The youth of noble blood became a squire at fourteen and might be a knight at twenty-one . Knighthood was conferred by the important cere-mony of girding with the sword and dubbing , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone had to be dubbed , emperors and kings as well ; the solemn accolade was therefore frequently the occasion of great merry-making . The memory of the festivities that marked the knighting of his two sons by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Mainz in 1184 remained for centuries . The ceremonial employed in these symbolic acts was not everywhere identical . It originated in France , where it was invested with the greatest solemnity . There the actual acco-lade was preceded by a kind of ritualistic bath and the vigil of arms at night in the chapel ; then the squire was girded with the sword and dubbed , originally by touching the neck with the palm of the hand , later by a stroke of the sword on the shoulders or back . The young man had then reached the highest rung to which he could climb ; the whole world , and all that it offered , lay open to him . How many men of humble birth , knights without property or wealth to mention only such men as Lusignan , Villehardouin , and Courtenay  - -  gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength alone ! Courage , temerity , and utter recklessness were naturally indispensable to a knight , but although an essential part of his character , they did not exhaust the attributes required of him . Spiritual devotion to his knightly obligations was quite as important possibly in a disciplinary sense it was the most valuable quality of all , for it made self-discipline his unending task . When , in the twelfth century , chivalry was at its height it was an idealistic institution with ideal aims . The perfect knight must disdain a life of mere pleasure , he had placed his person and his arms at the disposal of a higher cause . He was dedicated to religion , love , and the panoply oferms , must permit no wrong that he could prevent , and must always champion the right in the cause of the weak . He must I05 MODES AND MANNERS be not only courageous , but noble-minded and magnanimous , always ready to give up his life for bare honour . The en-deavour to unite the practical requirements of a military career with higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world with the idea of honour ' ? an idea which for centuries possessed a very real value , and which has lost its significance in Germany only since the Revolution . Talk to a Social Democrat of honour and he will not know what you mean ! The reli-gious obligations of a knight were extremely serious . The squire , when dedicated to knighthood , vowed to attend Mass daily , and the religious orders of knighthood have amply testified to the close link existing between the spirit of chivalry and the monkish spirit of the Church . Finally , chivalry acquired a peculiar significance through its attitude toward women . In this respect it was radically defying the ideas of the Church . The Church has never ceased to regard woman as an unclean and inferior being , an opinion intensified by scholasticism into a doubt whether she even possessed a soul . The Roman Catholic Church became the originator of witchtrials . The early Germans ascribed to women superhuman powers in nature-lore and in influencing natural phenomena , a belief which under the tegis of Christianity degenerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witchcraft as unchristian , but the Church gave every encouragement to belief in it . In the fifteenth century the Catholic clergy lighted the stakes whose flames cast their glow down to the eighteenth century and delivered unnumbered thousands of innocent victims to a cruel death . The Church extended to marriage its aversion to the female sex per se , for , since it regarded love for woman as the personification of sin , it saw in marriage an evil which must perforce be tolerated , but which it branded with the stigma of earthly sensuality . In the eyes of the Church marriage constituted a serious impediment to the attainment of the divine state , and even among the first Christians celibacy was regarded as an eminent Christian virtue . The Church io6 MODES AND MANNERS prohibited the marriage of priests as early as the fourth century , but did not succeed in enforcing this prohibition until a much later date . Among women only the virgin could attain Christian perfection , and the only form of marriage seriously countenanced by the Church was the Josephian , where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt for women the Church certainly concurred in the views of the Germanic people . One is now disposed to regard the flattering accounts by Tacitus as a censure of Roman conditions rather than as praise of the German , for , as a matter of fact , the ancient Germans were far from hold-ing women in particularly high esteem . The legal status of women was so inferior that in Friesland , Io8 THE AGE OF CHIVALRY for instance , a fatherless boy of seven could declare himself of age , and his mother then came under his guardianship . Legal relations between married couples rested on the fact that the wife was originally bought and was therefore the property of the husband . For her part , she must be faithful , but she had no claim to fidelity from him . For this reason the German enjoyed the right , down to the thirteenth century , to sell his wife ( and children ) ; in Norway a man could give , sell , or bequeath his wife to anyone he pleased . The Merovingian kings used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in favour of more frequent changes than were justified by actual decease and kept concubines as well as wives . Germanic custom recognized only one prohibited degree of relationship which excluded marriage ? that between parents and children ; marriage between brothers and sisters was nothing unusual , and in England marriage with a stepmother was quite a common thing . Marriage was an event weighed and determined by the families concerned ? a question of money , not an affair of the heart . The marriageable girl could not dispose of her own hand ; this was done by the nearest male relative usually , then , by the father or brother . In the case of heiresses of pro- Marriage perty or rank , the reigning prince had a considerable say in the matter , and the Emperor often interfered for the purpose of rewarding deserving men . Equality of 109 birth was strictly enforced , and the children of a man who had been prevailed upon to marry an unemancipated woman were bondfolk like their mother . In these circumstances the spouse was more a maidservant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drawn a rough partner she probably did not lack chastisement at his hands . Women knew no better state . Reinmar von Zweter once advised the men to cudgel their shrews well , as Siegfried treated Kriemhild for her foolish talk . The Father Confessor of St Elizabeth used to cuff his illustrious penitent right and left , although she was Landgravine of Thuringia . Women in high places led a life of the greatest seclusion . Siegfried spent a whole year at the court of King Gunther without catching so much as a glimpse of Kriemhild . In this relationship between the sexes , which before had been so hedged in with precautions , chivalry effected an almost unbelievable change . Woman , hitherto despised , suddenly became a goddess . This metamorphosis sprang from the idea that the woman must impart to the life and aspirations of the knight a higher consecration , and that all his commissions and omissions were made for her sake alone . The noble lady ' was the ideal ever before his eyes , his deeds of arms redounded to her glory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurture of chivalrous sentiment . To serve her with body and life was his highest honour , her love his best reward . This relation between man and woman was taken as such a matter of course that when Isolde was subjected to the ordeal , and had to resort to perjury and deceit to save herself , she reckoned upon the " courtesy " of God , Who , since He was a man , would undoubtedly help her out of the difficulty ? which He did ' So chivalry and homage to IIO THE AGE OF CHIVALRY woman ( Minnedienst ) were indissolubly knit , and the only question still unsolved is whether actual fact tallied with the descriptions handed down in the romances . The whole system was a French product , and was never acclimatized on German soil . The Kaiserchronik , compiled shortly after the year 1140 , which describes the early growth of courtly , knightly life , is not yet familiar with homage to women . Fifty years later this homage was fully developed , a well-known and established thing . The troubadours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to a supreme art and vested the homage and rules of the Minne-singer with an exquisite , lofty , and rare charm . At the same time they degraded woman-worship to a mere mode by carrying it to such lengths that it became ridiculous and died out . The homage paid by the troubadours to the ladies of their choice , a choice in which these ladies had no part , was exaggerated and excessive . They boasted in extravagant verse of the slightest marks of favour and ventured on follies which , had they not been so childish , might have been labelled madness . For love of his lady Lioba ( lupa , she-wolf ' ) , Pierre Vidal had himself sewn into a wolf-skin , and in this attrac-tive garb prowled about her castle . Unfortunately the sheep-dogs did not appreciate the refinements of this kind of court-ship , and so mauled the troubadour that the crazy loon nearly lost his life and had to keep to his bed for weeks . It was a comparatively slight affair when in honour of the beautiful Guida de Rodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their long locks cut off . In the hands of these chivalrous bards love became an art on a carefully graded scale comprising every emotion and delight . It ultimately became a game of dialectics where the ladies acted as judges in cases of dispute and pronounced verdicts against which there was no appeal . The famous tours d'arnour of Provence have , it is true , long since been assigned by experts like Diez to the realms of the fabulous . Weinhold rightly relegates them to the level of mere social entertainments . Even so , they re-mained a counteracting factor to masculine pride in brute III strength . As the ladies were always married women and were courted and praised in song not only by wandering minstrels , but by dukes and knights too , the prerequisite condition for the whole adventure should really have been a complete absence of jealousy on the part of the husbands of the admired beauties . But this class of mankind can not always have risen to the heights of chivalrous sentiment ; frequently , at all events , the husband proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roussillon had Guillaume de Cabestaing 's heart torn out and served up to his wife to eat . When he informed her of the nature of the dish she threw herself from the balcony of her room into an abyss . The number of such crimes perpetrated by jealous husbands could be considerably multiplied , but they serve merely to show the striking contrast between reality and the social ideal . The Germans , with their credulity and their mania for fashion , borrowed the whole system from the French , but there is good reason to doubt whether in Germany it ever THE AGE OF CHIVALRY became part of the reality of life . The manner in which interpretation may differ in accordance with national char-acter is plainly revealed in the fact that the troubadours invariably sang the praises of a definite lady , whereas the German Minnesingers worshipped the entire female sex without dis-tinction . This was cer-tainly a far less dangerous arrangement , and seems to indicate that inter-course between ladies and gentlemen was not entirely uncontrolled ; a number of bards , indeed , lament the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . The epic poetry of the French acquired a profound in-fluence over the German . Flor et Blancheflor , but more especially that epic of love-songs , Tristan et Iseult , also determined the spirit of German emo tional life , and helped to build up an imaginary world in which the pro-portion of light to shade was quite other than in real life . Clandestine love and for-bidden pleasures were the desired goal , adultery became an attractive sport , romantic worship made no secret that physical satisfaction was its aim . An episode in the Arthurian romances furnishes a good illustration of the lax attitude in matters of sex . It relates how at the court of the King not one of the noted beauties could pass the test of chastity , and it transpired that even the Queen had not been faithful to her spouse . One // MODES AND MANNERS would be well advised to mistrust the epics and romances and to regard many of the statements of the poets as what they are ? false glamour , calculated to dazzle and amaze . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , and the homage of the Minnesinger was probably in Germany a purely theoretical fashion . We have in the Styrian knight Ulrich von Lichtenstein a really classical example of the fact that in Germany homage to woman remained an eccentricity which was misinterpreted and rightly derided for its extravagance . Ulrich is a snob of chivalry and woman-worship . Esteemed as a lyric poet , his merit as an author lies in the fact that he was the originator of autobiographical literature in Germany , or , perhaps it would be more correct to say , of the first autobiographical novel . He writes so ingenuously , and does not even maintain silence about things which are scarcely flattering to him-self . But half his creations are only borrowed plumes , col-lected from other sources and skilfully arranged . His poem on homage to women contains episodes which he undoubtedly borrowed from novels ; the adventure in which he claims to have disguised himself as a leper , for instance , is taken from Tristan . Ulrich , whose supposed date of birth is 1198 and who died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' 4 THE AGE OF CHIVALRY of both ladies ? he does not name them ? to the knight who was forcing his attentions upon them is most frigid and dis-couraging . The one mocks quite openly at his harelip , his crippled hand , his inferior descent , and lets him see that she Frauenbuch , compiled in the fifties of the thirteenth century , the deeds he did in the service of two ladies to whom , con-trary to their wishes , he had dedicated himself . The attitude // considers him timid and faint-hearted . The other enters so little into his account that she and her complete passivity are possibly an invention . What is so diverting is that the sole desire of Ulrich 's lady is to rid herself of her unwanted admirer in a polite way . So she tries to drive him to the crusade undertaken by the Emperor Frederick II in 1227 ? a ruse she was not alone in employing . The corn-plaint that the ladies in their arrogance claimed the impossible and subjected their adorers to unduly severe tests was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should join in a crusade was , of course , a quite ideal pretext for warding off a presumptuous admirer . There is , on the other hand , no lack of evidence of the gross immorality which accompanied the Minnedienst ( service of love ' ) . There were knights in plenty who obtained payment in cash or in gifts for proof of their love for their ladies . The whole business was barely a century old when Tannhduser made such cruel sport of the cult of woman . The most bitter satire on life in general was supplied by Ulrich von Lichtenstein , a man with a wife and four children who felt continually impelled to seek adventure in the service of other ladies . That the veneration shown to women led to no improve-ment in either their legal or their social status is sure proof that the homage paid to them was only a game . Woman remained , as of old , a dependant at the mercy of man 's whims . Chivalry as a flourishing social institution was a thing Knightly of brief duration , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain the ideals to which it aspired . If the manner in which knights conducted warfare and treated their prisoners was difficult to reconcile with the spirit of // a good Christian , it was certainly completely at variance with all expression of magnanimity and nobility of mind . Oppression of the peasant was the idea underlying every feud , the aim being to ruin him so as to curtail the revenues of his lord . In the War of the Swabian League twelve hundred townships were reduced to ashes . Nor was incendiarism all ; men and cattle were slaughtered , orchards cut down , vine-yards uprooted , weeds sown in the fields . Albert Achilles , Elector of Brandenburg , boasted of having fired a hundred and sixty villages singlehanded . Jorg von Ehingen relates with much satisfaction , and as a matter of course , how he and his comrades went to the assistance of the King of Castile and carried on warfare in prosperous Granada after their own hearts . They " stormed the township and the cita-del and slew all the heathen . The lackeys also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children , which was likewise done . We destroyed , burned , and slew whatever we came across . " Woe to him who fell into the hands of the enemy ! Short work was made of persons of low degree : they were either killed , or mutilated and set free . In the course of a feud between Count Raimund de SaintGilles and Richard Cceur de Lion the Count captured some merchants of Poitiers belonging to his opponent ; he had them mutilated and their eyes put out ? atrocities which prisoners of higher degree were not spared either . In the hope of extracting a large ransom they were subjected , in order to make them tractable , to treatment which was the very reverse of chivalrous . The dungeons in which they were generally incarcerated were horrible enough , without light or air , stone cold and damp , and swarming with vermin . Often they were placed in chains as well , and had only chance or their own iron constitutions to thank if they did not rot in their own filth before deliverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exquisite torture . English and French kings had captured knights blinded , or drenched with water in the winter and left to dry in the north wind . In short , each man gave free rein to his sadistic impulses . What the Italian despots such as Ezzelino da Romano and others accomplished in this respect no pen may record . The Visconti had reduced torture to a system which permitted the prisoner to be racked for some forty days before death put an end to his unendur-able agony . Woman-worship was merely a fashion ; the men , most of whom were chiefly cultivating their physical strength , soon 1 18 THE AGE OF CHIVALRY abandoned their knightly training to relapse into their old ways and went hunting instead of to battle . The wars of the Albigenses struck a mortal blow at chivalry in France , and the Crusades , accompanied by the phenomena mentioned above , further exposed the false outlook of knightly circles . Loud were the laments of Walther von der Vogelweide , Hugo von Trimberg , and others , when they recalled the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for the burgher . Other ideas now held sway , and those very Crusades , by bringing such different nationalities into contact with one another , were responsible for widening the mental horizon of the people of those days and undermining their prejudices . In rivalry with urban civilization chivalry succumbed as an obsolete and superfluous system . It had lost the lead in intellectual life , and adapted itself ill to the new ways of living , which were quite incompatible with its character . Some of its adherents hired themselves to the highest bidder , others became mere highwaymen ; the rest turned their knightly qualifications to account , like any other civilian craft , in earning their daily bread . If this movement be followed down to its death in the fifteenth century its deterioration will excite a certain regretful surprise . The knight , setting out after adventure , still exists , but he has turned into a commercial traveller , hacking and slashing his way along , out for profits and no longer even remotely a romantic figure . The best business man could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ehingen furnishes in his Reisen nach der Ritterschaft ( In Quest of Chivalry ) .

' He came home covered in debt , and the attempts at borrowing made by the completely beggared knight , first at the Seigniory of Venice , then of the Emperor Frederick , failed miserably . He was everywhere most amiably received , but with no practical results . Nowhere did he obtain money or its equivalent , only orders galore ? quite the modern spirit ! King Edward IV of England , King Rene of Sicily , and King . Henry of Castile not only received him into their orders , but pressed a few extra samples on him THE AGE OF CHIVALRY so that he might sell them . To such a pass , then , had orders come in so comparatively short a time ! This distinction became a commercial article .

Cannon was certainly known in the early fourteenth century , and I2I MODES AND MANNERS by the middle of this century the German Imperial cities already owned quite fine artillery , but these implements were employed only in the besieging of fortified castles and towns . As the powder was faulty in composition , its behaviour was always dubious , and it frequently did more harm to its own side than to the enemy . In 136o , for instance , the town hall at Lubeck blew up because powder had been stored there without proper precautions . The cannon was too unwieldy and cumbrous for use in the open field ; generals who , like Charles the Bold , took cannon with them to battle always risked its loss .

When the proud army of knights belonging to the Duke of Austria was vanquished by the Swiss peasants at Sempach on July 9 , 1386 , the decisive blow was struck at an obsolete system . The Swiss did not concern themselves with the rules and regulations of the game ; their aim was to guard their freedom , and to this end all means were faircatch as catch can ! Exactly a century later they trampled the magnificent armies of Charles the Bold just as disastrously under foot at Granson and Morat , thereby finally proving the infinite superiority of the foot soldier to the heavily armoured knight . Thereafter the business of war passed from the hands of a single caste into those of hired mercenaries , I22 THE AGE OF CHIVALRY the feudalism of chivalrous society yielded to the standing armies of absolute monarchy . Force of external circumstances was not alone responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to fail because the foundations upon which it was built were collapsing . It represented the highest of those self-contained classes which composed medieval society , the natural inferiority of the others furnishing the essential condition for its existence . At a later date the social levels in those centuries , with their intimate connexion , were distinguished under the heads of the military caste , the working-class , and the scholastic profession ? fairly apt distinctions . The whole of society was organized on a collective basis , and the activity of the individual was allowed no scope . He was not , so to speak , // an independent being of any consequence , but only a unit of the stock from which he was descended , and had to submit to the will of the head of the family . Viewed from the standpoint of his place in social life , his dependence appears even greater , for there he was but a member of a guild , a fellowship , in a sphere with strictly circumscribed limits . The Church proceeded to organize on a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the practice of their religion the joint affair of an intimate circle . This organization was shattered as a result of the powerful element of unrest introduced throughout civilian life by the Crusades . The Church was the first to feel the reaction . It had wrenched man from contact with nature and represented to him as sinful all impulses connected with the senses ; in so doing , however , it had only laid bare the deep schism dividing Christianity , as conceived by the Church , from real life . This gulf was emphasized by the fact that the higher spiritual law set up by the Church failed to content the soul ; it might satisfy the intellect , but not the heart . The organization of religious observances was likewise governed by cold objectivity ; no heed was paid to individual temperament . Now began , in the thirteenth // century , the great movement of subjective religiosity , a movement which originated in the Rhone district in France . Christianity had become a source of wealth to the Church of Rome ; it should become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The propagation of the Gospel and the administration of the Sacrament must be freed from the bondage of the foreign tongue and made really accessible to the people in their language of common parlance instead of in Latin . The Church might possibly have recognized these claims , but the anti-clerical nature of the reform rendered a change difficult . Not Christianity , nor even the visible Church , but the abuses practised by the clergy were the great impediment . If , for instance , the indictments of Rutebeeuf against the artifices and ruses , the deceit and greed , of the clergy are examined , and it is borne in mind that such attacks were only too well justified and found a very loud echo in Italy , the inimical attitude to the movement perforce adopted by the Church becomes entirely comprehensible . The Church never sought any possible justification for such movements , but simply quelled their protagonists . In dealing with the Albigenses it was eminently // successful , as it was clever enough to represent them as heretics and to let loose against them all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , whatever its potentialities for thwarting over-bold attempts at reform , the Church could not control the spiritual tendency of the day . By its violent propaganda on behalf of the Crusades the Church had itself awakened the public conscience , created a spirit of doubt and unrest , and aroused a desire for something more from religion than mere promises of salvation paid for in cash . Now people would no longer be pacified by traditional usage . They craved direct union with God and the abolition of mediation by the Church . In opposition to the empty mental dallyings of a palsied scholasticism arose mysticism , a call from the heart craving food for the soul . To the mystics it was no longer a question of conducting ingenious arguments on dogma , but of perceiving God : they wanted a religion of the heart , not of the brain . But the authority of the Church hinged on the letter of the Word ; it was shattered by the verdict that it could not meet the calls of purely spiritual emotions . As the purest manifestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Scriptures , mysticism necessarily led to a study of the Bible , hitherto accessible only to the scholar in the Latin translation . With feelings of intense dismay the clergy also perceived not only that the Bible was far more generally read now , but that it was being translated into the vulgar tongues . From the middle of the fourteenth century translations of the Bible in the ver-nacular began to pass from hand to hand , and in 1466 the // first German version appeared . With the perusal of " God 's Word " criticism and the subjective interpretation of Christianity waxed strong . Soon the land teemed with " Friends of God " cherishing ideas far removed from the dry formalism of the Church . Not even in its proper sphere  --  that of faith had the Church been able to sustain a consistent philosophy ; it failed to uphold its views . Parallel with this purely religious movement , which ulti-mately led to release from the fetters of theological meta-physics , ran another , which , with Erwin Rosenthal , we will call individuation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social system of the Middle Ages and implied the conscious birth of individuality . This occurred in two ways , of which the intellectual enlighten-ment diffused by the troubadours was no less important than the cultural endeavours of the Italian Humanists based on classical authors . The two together provided a new moral philosophy , a fresh interpretation of life and its duties . // This was the age when the growing culture of the middle classes was making the towns the real centres of social life . The new mode of living created new vitality . There awoke the consciousness that the possibilities of spiritual development were all contained within man himself , and could neither be supplied nor withheld from without . The individual came into his own , individualities emerged . This was at variance , of course , with the views of the Church . The towns did , however , break away from the ascetic , hierarchical principles for which the Church stood and which , by the fourteenth century , were already lacking ' in substance , conviction , and force . The professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope as the cause of all the ills from which the world was then suffering . At the turning-point of these two eras stands Dante as the last of the medievals , truly a man with a superhuman measure of all intellectual powers . He garnered the knowledge and emotions of innumerable generations that they might shine forth anew like some splendid sunset . We owe it to Dante that the late Middle Ages are still so living and that interest in their abundant manifestations can never die . But Petrarch exerted a greater influence in his time . He was the first of the moderns in the sense that his one wish was to live in the fullness of his powers , and his achievement of this explains I28 THE AGE OF CHIVALRY the charm by which he bewitched his contemporaries . He had plunged so fervently into the study of the classical literature of Rome that it formed an integral part of his thought , added to which his feeling for nature became a vital emotion in a time when landscape and its beauties were not yet apprehended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always left the final decision to reason , astonished and de-lighted all Europe . He was the first to venture to express individuality , and as he did so with considered knowledge , in an elegant style , and in a manner combining vigour with charm , his influence proved as extensive as the knowledge of reading and writing . In the pessimism which so often in-forms his work Petrarch displays quite a modern trait . In his case it results from the incompatibility of learning and faith . His example served to encourage many a successor . // MODES AND MANNERS They quite openly ventured to be humans and abandoned all thought of dissimulating their atheism ; it no longer led to the stake . The Renaissance was soon to produce in Italy philosophers who quite calmly confessed themselves pan-theists , sceptics , or mere sensualists . Increased culture , a result of improving conditions among the middle classes , greatly contributed to this spiritual emancipation , and doubtless the achievement of economic independence played its part here too . // Turning against this movement , chivalry declined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the middle classes , with their wealth and influence , was merely strengthened by the new aspirations to culture and knowledge . This contempt of the scribe , to whom the chivalrous arts were foreign , was of long standing ; even the sound and wide culture of the Emperor Frederick II had been greatly resented by his contemporaries . King Rene of Sicily , an enthusiastic amateur painter , had to indulge his taste in the greatest secrecy , because this art was regarded as an occupation of the lower classes . The nobility , with incom-prehensible shortsightedness , obstinately persisted in disparag-ing book-learning . The more indispensable its possession for those who wanted to advance themselves , the more was it iii MODES AND MANNERS rejected by the upper classes , who considered the acquisition of knowledge of this kind beneath their dignity and that they could in any case dispense with it . Wilwolt von Schaumburg deprecates this attitude in the autobiography he completed in 1507 . " Because for some time now the nobility despise all learning and do not seek to attend universities or acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so being mocked and called scribblers by the ignoramuses , therefore the peasant children achieve learning and attain to bishoprics and high office . " His voice nevertheless remained that of one crying in the wilderness . His social equals continued to exclude themselves from the new intellectual element and thereby facilitated the progress of princely absolutism . The princes employed nobles and knights as personal court flunkeys , and entrusted the important State posts , the chancellorship and so forth , to scholarly men of the middle class , from whom hankerings after independence need not be feared . Chivalry perished because the foundations on which it was based gave way , but the middle class was to have no cause for great rejoicing in its acquisitions . Certainly it overtook the upper classes and soon exceeded them in possessions and // social standing , but it had the craftsmen and peasants at its heels . The patriciate which had formed in the towns and was asserting its authority had to contest its rights with the guilds , and during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries their validity was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Imperial cities . And , as if this were not enough , the ideas of the ecclesiastical reformers , which hinged on the concept of a lasting peace with God , rapidly veered round ; instead of freeing men from their passions , they goaded them on . Study of the Bible , indisputably among the most dangerous for the immature intellect , in-flamed the minds of the oppressed . With good reason they read into it whatever seemed desirable and pleasing , especially the right to equality of possessions . The corn-munism of the fifteenth century , which in Swabia and Franconia and on the Upper Rhine drove vast numbers of peasants to arms and to excesses which were wilder in proportion to the severity of their oppression , justified all its claims with passages from the Bible . Another failure for the ecclesiastical system ! // Far-reaching national risings convulsed Europe in the four-teenth and fifteenth centuries . They have been aptly com-pared to mountain torrents which overflow and , without warning , pour down the valleys , engulfing everything along their path . They dealt destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved nothing and changed nothing . Feudalism quelled these insurrections by martial means , but did so to the benefit of its heir , princely absolutism . The effects of the intellectual movements which had stirred the Occident ever since the Crusades can not be discussed without making mention of the chief factor instrumental in altering the face of the world ? printing . The name of the German Gutenberg will remain permanently associated with this invention , notwithstanding the fact that printed books existed long before his time , in other countries than China . But , apart from the invention of the printing-press , the technical improvements for which he was responsible and the invention of the mould which made possible the mechanical multiplication of the type , all with bodies of uniform height , represented the decisive fac-tor enabling books of considerable extent to be printed in any number . The taking of the city of Mainz in 1462 , which appeared at the time to be of purely local significance , only of interest to the aristocrats who were disputing the archi-episcopal See , proved an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized world . It scattered throughout Europe the journeyman-printers employed at Mainz and permitted the establishment of printing-works far and wide . Neither the inventor nor his immediate successors were aware of what they had achieved or were doing . At first they even thought that printing could take the place of hand-writing and tried to mislead book-collectors by asking as much for their products as for the manuscripts . The inven-tion was nevertheless more marvellous and did more to revolutionize the civilized world than possibly any before or since . Its future was assured . With printing a new era of mankind began . // ARCHITECTURE , SCULPTURE , AND PAINTING CLASSICAL art , now on the wane , had sunk to a level con-sonant with a perishing civilization and indulged in luxury and profusion . Fashion delighted in the use of the most costly materials , which were conveyed to Rome from the ends of the earth . The ruins of Rome and Italy are now the only places in which may be found many rare old variegated marbles whose quarrying-places are lost to memory . The superabundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to recon-struct the classical aspect of the Roman Forum , Olympia , Delphi , or any other ancient centre of artistic activity , realization of the extent to which the panorama in those days differed from modern views of aesthetic requirements will soon be borne in upon one with something of a shock . Here were building after building , pillar upon pillar , surrounded on all sides by a perfect army of statues , but nowhere even a shade of relieving green . Plastic art had been for centuries confined to the manu-facture of replicas . Notwithstanding considerable losses , we still possess to-day dozens of copies of many famous works ? not all of equal merit , for the standard of the patrons appears to have suffered a steady decline . Technical activity gradually ceased . Demands were met from available stock , and just as Rome once despoiled the classical haunts of Greece of their works of art , so statuary was now shipped in whole boatloads from Italy to Carthage or Byzantium . The founding of the latter was a factor which accounted to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victim to the general disintegration . To what degree Christianity was responsible for its decline is difficult // to determine . Christianity was , it is true , definitely inimical to anything appertaining to the senses , as is shown in its condemnation of physical beauty as sinful , but in the cause of civilization and its manifold requirements art was indispensable . Christianity had need of communal assembly halls , frescoes , mosaics , sarcophagi , and tombs , and it was therefore incumbent upon it to find some point of contact with pagan art . No matter how different the bias of Christian percep-tions and the direction taken by Christian imagination might be , classical methods of representation could not so easily be abandoned , and Christianity had to adapt itself as best it could in matters of symbolism and expression . The more firmly Christianity established itself in the Roman world , and the better it asserted itself , the more plainly were its tendencies // displayed in art . Love of beautiful form for its own sake disappeared , and in the eschewing of nature is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not that which is perceived with the senses . Some assert and others deny that the realization of these aesthetic principles was accompanied by a suspension of artistic effort and a falling off in technical ability . Since we , who live in similar times of deterioration and decline , are forced to con-template a modern art that prides itself on its lack of art , declaring this lack to be intentional , we have also given those far-off times the credit of a different vision and different // conceptions of art . In the era of newspaper information , of which not more than io per cent . must ever be true , skilled and practised journalists may impose anything they wish on the uninitiated and call the most abominable daubs great art ; but these methods , praiseworthy though they may be at the present day , arc not applicable to the past , whose docu-mentary evidence not even the most skilful pen can falsify . It is not possible to examine the works of art produced during the first millennium of the Christian era without becoming aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , but the mode of expression em-ployed was so plainly indicative of failing ability that there is something unconsciously humorous about the statement that the results could have been better if so desired .
