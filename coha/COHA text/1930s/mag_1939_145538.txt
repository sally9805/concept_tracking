For actors , opening night means excitement and strain under the cold , fishy stare of critics . For the critics , opening night means running , sometimes before the show is over , back to their typewriters . For authors , after squirming in a seat at the rear of the house or wandering backstage with a brandy bottle , it means keeping a death watch until 4 a.m. , when the papers come out . <P> But for audiences , an important first night is a combination of theatrical gamble and social sure thing . Cafe Society , theatre people , Bohemians , middle-class Johnny-on-the-spots-the toughest theatre crowd in the world to please-are the backbone of every Broadway first-night audience . An hour before curtain time , a mob of babbling celebrity-chasers and autograph hounds , aged ten to 70 , starts lining up outside the theatre entrance . As . taxis and limousines roll up , the audience 's audience gurgles and gasps ( " It 's Elsa Maxwell ! " , " It 's Freddie March ! " , " There 's Dorothy Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . <P> Inside the theatre , lobby and aisles are jammed . Chinchilla arrives to snub ermine and mink . Amid the babel of voices can be heard the high British squeak , languid Southern drawl . Continental roll of rs , marcelled New Yorkese . Down in front , as she has been at nearly every Broadway first night for over 20 years , sits elderly , fragile Mrs. Rita Katzenberg . <P> Last week the season reached its limou-zenith : Cafe Society 's favorite performer , Beatrice Lillie , headlined a revue , Set to Music , by Cafe Society 's pet playwright , Noel Coward . Autograph fiends were in Heaven , pressed together as close as the cards in a sealed deck . A battery of photographers flashed their bulbs as into the Music Box streamed the John Barrymores , Prince Serge Obolensky , Margo , Tallulah Bankhead , Major Bowes , Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , Hope Hampton , Lady Castlerosse , Lucius Beebe , many another . <P> From their pet playwright the glittering audience got only Grade B Coward . One superb , side-splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch that Coward has ever written . Two of the songs , Mad About the Boy and The Stately Homes of England : * <P> The baby in the guest wing <P> Who crouches by the grate <P> Was walled up in the west wing <P> In Fourteen Twenty Eight . <P> are top-notch but are lifted from previous Coward shows in London . For the rest , except for some nimble lyrics , Set to Music is Coward lazily repeating himself , once or twice turning sentimental with his usual bad taste , or trusting to luck and Lillie . <P> Lillie did not fail him . Whether bursting into a Fragonard boudoir as Brnnhilde on a white horse , or playing a world-weary actress with only energy enough to scoop up gifts of jewelry with both hands , or wandering around a Siberian railway station disguised as a spy , Lillie had only to cock an eyebrow to cause a commotion , drop a muff to start a riot . The world 's coolest and most custom-tailored crackpot , she was never , in her satire , more unerring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the copyright owner , Chappell &; Co . Inc.
