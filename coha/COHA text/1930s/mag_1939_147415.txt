FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY 'S OFFICE - Arthur Train-Scribner-($3) . <P> As a lawyer , Arthur Train has been assistant district attorney of New York County . As a writer , he has authored 40 books from love stories ( The Needle 's Eye ) to firsthand reporting of his police and court experiences ( Courts , Criminals and the Camorra ) . But most people know Arthur Train as the creator of tall , gaunt , kindly , shrewd , humorous , cigar-smoking Lawyer Ephraim Tutt , who by using the tricks of the law to outsmart the tricks of the law , manages to evoke a brand of justice that , if not strictly according to Blackstone , is humane and just . <P> In his latest book Author-Lawyer Train moves to modernize antiquated laws and legal procedure , make justice just without having to outsmart the law . Taking his Prisoner at the Bar ( published in 1905 but still in demand ) as a basis , he drew again on his police and court experience to produce From the District Attorney 's Office , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fails , with liberal proposals for making it work better . <P> How much dead wood has to be hacked away before the course of true justice can be made to run straight , he makes clear in discussions of the nature of crime , arrest , the jury , the judge , tricks of the trade , fool laws . Clinching his points with many a keenly human story , he reviews such legal circuses as the trial of Bruno Hauptmann ( Author Train thinks Hauptmann got what he should have got but not the way he should have got it ) , a legal lynching like that of Leb Frank , who , though probably innocent , was convicted of rape by a Georgia jury in 1914 , later physically lynched . <P> Author Train takes his best pokes at screwball laws . Samples : a Los Angeles ordinance forbidding " more than one person bathing in or occupying a bathtub at the same time " ; a statute stating that " when two trains approach each other at a crossing , both shall stop and neither shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed criminal justice and to prevent lawyers and clients from outsmarting justice by legal tricks , Author-Lawyer Train suggests that : 1 ) cases should be tried in court , not in the yellow press ; 2 ) suspects should be examined before trial in the presence of their counsel ; 3 ) jury verdicts should not have to be unanimous ( in murder cases , eleven out of twelve is enough , in other cases , a lesser number ) ; 4 ) the use of peremptory challenges should be cut down , practically abolished . He adds : " The history of criminal legislation , however , suggests that none of these obvious reforms will be adopted at least during this generation . "
