Dr. Howard Schultz Anders of Philadelphia hates dirt and dust . He has spent 50 of his 72 years chasing it out of city streets . In the early 1900s Dr. Anders induced the Pennsylvania State Legislature to pass an antispitting law . He also forced the Philadelphia transit company to replace dirty plush streetcar seats with clean , bare benches . In 1919 , during a local row over politics in the street-cleaning system , he raised a dust storm with his carpet-beating outburst : " Dust is pulverized poison and we have seen in Filthadelphia too much drifting into damned deferential silences . " <P> Last week Dr. Anders himself was on the carpet , and the reason was a pulverized poison called morphine . By regulation of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , a physician may not supply morphine to a known addict . But for two years Dr. Anders has been feeding heroic doses of morphine to addict Fred Barrick , a busy Philadelphia insurance agent . Federal agents warned Dr. Anders three times to cut off Fred Barrick 's supply . Three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor and his patients . " Finally the agents caught Dr. Anders off base . <P> Into the respectable wholesale drug house of John Wyeth &; Bro. , Inc. stumbled Fred Barrick last month . Waving an official Government order blank signed by Dr. Anders , he demanded 500 half-grain tablets of morphine sulphate , enough to choke a team of horses . Since Government order blanks are for the personal use of physicians who purchase narcotics wholesale for office use , the druggists promptly called the narcotic squad . <P> Barrick was clapped into prison , where he threw two " whizbangs " ( fake convulsions ) , demanded ten grains of morphine . ( Average pain-killing dose : between 1/6 and grain . ) Strangely enough , after several dopeless days , he did not become violent or sick , as most addicts do , but calmed down , gained weight . <P> Last week , Dr. Anders was indicted for illegally " selling " Barrick some 10,000 half-grain morphine tablets in the past two years . No man to preserve a " damned deferential silence , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke his mind to Philadelphia reporters . Said he : <P> " The patient had been addicted to narcotics before he came to me , mainly because he was suffering from three chronic ailments . . . . Although Fred Barrick was an addict he was a chronic , continually sick man ; however , when relieved by morphine he was of phenomenally acute , alert , clear and competent mentality . . . . I believe I am right and loyal to my profession in relieving him or anyone . . . if thereby I can save him to some useful purpose . . . . The extraordinary tolerance the man had for gluttonous dosage often 20 grains a day was . . . so marvelous that his case deserves my future recording of it for medical history . "
