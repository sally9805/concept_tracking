On the Pennsylvania Railroad 's Columbus-to-Dayton stretch a section gang working near Selma , leaned on their tools one morning last week to watch the crack St. Louisana whip by on its way from Manhattan to St. Louis . As the flyer thundered past there was a tremendous gasp from the big , black K-4 locomotive , and from the cab belched strange clouds of steam . On toward nearby Cedarville it hissed , roared over the Main Street crossing with no warning blast , came to a wheezing stop at the town 's westerly limits . But no human hand had thrown the brake . The engineer and his fireman , scalded and dead , were lying three miles back , along the Selma grade . <P> A " crown sheet , " which fits over the locomotive boiler 's end separating the water chamber from the fire box , had given way . The water drenched the fires and steamed , scalding , into the cab . The ultimate dissipation of the locomotive 's steam pressure had set the air brakes , averting calamity . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steam keeps the brakes off the wheels . When the steam head is released , the air valve opens , letting the air escape and clamping on the brakes . <P> Railroadmen thought the accident might have been due to insufficient water in the boiler . Last week the disabled locomotive stood boarded up at Xenia , Ohio , awaiting inspection by the Interstate Commerce Commission .
