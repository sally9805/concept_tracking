Some 50 miles off the coast of French Guiana one day last week the steamer Lorraine Cross met a tiny , two-masted tub lolloping along under sail with a distress signal flying . When the master of the Lorraine Cross asked what was wrong , the four men on the little tub 's deck shouted back that she was the Margaret Harold bound from London to Trinidad via Gibraltar , that they were completely out of food and fuel . The Lorraine Cross 's captain observed that the ship 's name had been painted out . He asked to see her papers . At once the four men yanked down their distress signal , hoisted sail , made off toward the South American coast . There every ship and port at once set eager watch for her , for the Lorraine Cross radioed that the shy Margaret Harold was really the motor trawler Girl Pat which ran away from Great Grimsby on the Humber , England , on All Fools ' Day , was outlawed by Lloyd 's and was last seen at Dakar , French West Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The many rumors about the motive of Girl Pat 's wild escapade were last week laid by Harry Stone , her onetime mate , who was left behind in the Dakar Hospital . Said he : " When we left Grimsby , it was to fish . But Skipper Osborne had plans of his own . He was going to sell the boat in some foreign port and divide the proceeds with the crew . . . . We had no charts-only a child 's atlas we 'd bought at Woolworth 's . . . . I was ill . In Dakar . . . they had to leave me behind . I ca n't say I 'm sorry . "
