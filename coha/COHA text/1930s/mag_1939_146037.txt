DATELINE : EUROPE - Leonard Ross - Harcourt , Brace ( $2 ) . <P> Two years ago , Leo Calvin Rosten , 31 , Polish-born teacher , humorist , researcher , social scientist , won pseudonymous fame as Leonard Q. Ross , author of The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N . When that book appeared , Author Rosten was in Washington , working on a serious journalistic survey , The Washington Correspondents . Sly Author Rosten enjoyed hearing correspondents chuckle over Hyman Kaplan , ask who Leonard Q. Ross might be . Afraid they might not take his research job seriously if they knew , Author Rosten kept mum . <P> In Dateline : Europe he adds a split to the already dual personality of Rosten and Ross , in a glib , neatly joined short novel about a foreign correspondent . Laid in Belgovenia , it covers the adventures of Peter Strake and girls in an abortive Putsch , drips conversational tinsel like a Christmas tree , is neither standard Ross nor Rosten . As one character says : " It 's like a cross between Graustark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Authors McCutcheon , Scheherazade , Oppenheim might object , but to most readers Dateline : Europe will seem like a versatile slip which can do Author Rosten no harm , if not repeated .
