txt James J. Walker sailed for Europe yesterday , but he promised to be back in twenty days . The trip was for his health , he said , and " to get away from desks and telephones . " Whether he was seeking to recoup his health to plunge into a fight for the Mayoralty seat that he vacated , or whether he planned to remain Citizen Walker , was as much in the air as ever . The two men in whose hands his political career rests , Tammany Leader John F. Curry and Brooklyn Leader John H. McCooey , were silent , as they have been since the night he resigned , as to the significance , one way or another , of the ex-Mayor 's hasty and unannounced departure . Mr. Curry 's comment was : " I hope he has a pleasant voyage . " Mr. Walker , aboard ship , found that his hope for privacy on the voyage was doomed to disappointment , as he had chosen to sail on the Conte Grande , a ship that had already booked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the maiden voyage here of the new Italian liner Rex . Says Schroeder Ordered Trip . The former Mayor assured them that the trip had been ordered by his physician , Dr. William Schroeder Jr . He conveyed the impression that he had planned to go to the Adirondacks but had changed his mind the night before . It was recalled , however , that a prominent Democrat close to the former Mayor had predicted several days ago that Mr. Walker would go abroad and that when he returned it would be to resume private practice as a lawyer . Mr. Walker , if he returns on the Conte Grande , as he said yesterday he would , will be back in New York before Oct. 1 , giving him ample time to mend his political fences before the time Tammany and its allies make public their choice for the unexpired Mayoralty term . The conviction continued to grow , however , that Mr. Walker would not be back in the Mayor 's office at City Hall on Jan. 1 , 1933 . One prominent leader , who participated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked yesterday if he thought the former Mayor would leave if a plan of action had not already been agreed upon . The answer was that " that might be good reasoning , but then , again , might n't he need his health for a campaign ? " Elimination From Race Seen . In other quarters there was increasing speculation as to whether Tammany would dare to risk losing the hold on the city that it has enjoyed for sixteen years by renominating the former Mayor . It was pointed out that Mr. Walkers prestige had sunk during the short time that he has been out of office and Joseph V. in . There seemed to be agreement that the holes picked in the general city administration by Mr. , in his incumbency , were as damaging as the revelations of Samuel Seabury before the Hofstadter legislative investigating committee . Mayor revealed after the departure of the former Mayor had become known that the latter had telephoned him up to say good-bye . Otherwise none but the former Mayor 's personal friends and Mr. Curry were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor that of his former executive secretary , George S. Collins , who accompanied him , was on the passenger list . Sailing Kept Secret . Mr. Walker and his party of a dozen or so friends came to the pier in three limousines , and hurried to the cabin on B deck . His booking was made secretly on a blank form ticket , and only one employe of the line , a director , knew that he was sailing . In his cabin besides Mr. Walker was Hector Fuller of the Mayor 's committee , Edward L. Stanton , his former secretary ; Acting Captain Thomas F. O'Connor , who has been 1 the former Mayor 's personal guard ; Mr. Collins , his executive secretary ; his friend , A. C. Blumenthal , and 1Dr . Schroeder . It was 11:30 when the party came aboard , and at 11:45 , while his friends were still in his cabin , Mr. Walker came to the suite door and talked to reporters , leaning against a trunk still standing at the entrance . He said he did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the doctor 's orders . " " I am really being shanghaied by a medical man , " he said , laughing . Then he pointed to Dr. Schroeder , who was stattiling in the cabin , and said : " There he is , there . " Mr. Walker said he was going 11 abroad for his health and would not be gone " very long . " He explained that his physician was worried about his blood pressure , and felt that a rest on the Conte Grande would help him to regain his strength . The Conte Grande will return about the last day of the month . Mr. Walker , when asked if he planned to return on the Rex , which will reach New York on Oct. 4 , said he had heard of the new ship , but preferred to stay on the Conte Grande . " I do n't want to come on ' the new ship because I imagine there will be a lot of excitement and I do n't want that . I 'll stay on this ship for the round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that Mrs. Walker would have accompanied him , but that her health would not permit her to take the trip . " She is one brave woman , " he observed . Then , apparently addressing the world in general , he mused : " Why is it that they have done everything to throw me down and now they wo n't let me go in peace ? I guess it is human nature . It was the same with Pericles . " Pericles , it will be recalled , was the statesman under whose leadership Athens enjoyed its golden age but who was so bitterly criticized that he eventually died heart-broken at the attacks upon himself and his friends . The recent hearing before Governor Roosevelt and Mr. Walker 's plans for running again were brought up , but the former Mayor ruled them out , saying he would not discuss such things , and that his only plan was " to get back my health . " He appeared to be in fair health when he sailed , although he looked tired and his face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a minimum of the usual banter and repartee . After the gangway had been lifted he came to the A deck promenade and leaned over the railing for ten minutes calling farewells to Mrs. Walker and the party of friends . They attracted other pier visitors to the spot and soon the Mayor was being hailed by men and women who called him by his first name and bid him bon voyage . A group of girls standing next to the pier railing asked Mr. Walker for a cigarette and he drew a gold and enamel case from a vest pocket and opened it . He threw a cigarette to one girl , and then two more as others held out their hands . The girls did not smoke , but put the cigarettes in their vanity cases carefully . Others held out their hands , but the former Mayor replaced his case with the remark that he would " soon have to give up smoking if I keep this up . " Mrs. Walker stayed on the pier until the ship began to slip out of the dock into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , white shirt and black tie . He was wearing a light-gray hat . As the Conte Grande 's lines were released and she began moving out of the slin the crowd who had been watching his face surged forward again crying " good luck , Jimmy , " and other farewell felicitations . Two reporters who were on the ship moved to Mr. Walker 's side and spoke to him . He looked around , smiled to the crowd on the pier and shook hands with his visitors . As the ship went out into the river he left the deck and apparently went in to his cabin . Up ? until the time the former Mayor sailed the offices of the Italian Line denied that he had booked . It was explained later that one of the three directors had reserved the suite in person for the voyage and the ticket was issued in blanks
