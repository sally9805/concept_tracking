txt  | Plastic deformation , or flow of the metal under the force has taken place . The plastic flow of metals was pointed to at the beginning of this chapter as perhaps the most important behavior of the metals , the one which distinguishes it most sharply from other materials of construction . Some of the most important metal-figure lurgical operations known as " shaping " are in fact essentially examples of plastic deformation . For instance , shaping operations such as stamping of automobile parts , pressing of large objects , spinning of aluminum pans , rolling of boiler plate , rails and I-beams , drawing of wire , extrusion of moldings or telephone cable , and forging of shafts are all processes involving the plastic deformation of the metal . Riveting and bending are closely allied to them . Included also are the various machining operations , such as milling , turning in a lathe , sawing and  | punching , as of rivet holes . Clearly these operations extend throughout many of our most important industrial processes , and the behavior of the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation . ' The changes produced in the properties of the metal so deformed are important also . We shall consider first the deformation of metal while cold , called " cold working . " The Deformation of a Single Crystal. ? The study of the mechanism of the deformation which takes place in each crystallite of a cold-worked metallic object can be load , , , , simplified by singling out one single crystal /.95kg and observing how it behaves under similar deformation . Many of the important mechanical properties of a metal are to be understood from the behavior of the single crystals of which it is composed . The preparation of a single crystal wire was described on page 34 . After we have examined the behavior of a single crystal under deformation we shall then come to the study of an ordinary crystalline aggregate or metallic object with a clearer view . Deformation by Slip. ? If stressed in tension a single crystal of zinc elongates slightly , a line appears around it showing displacement of one part of the wire with respect to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another line parallel to the first appears indicating another displacement and again slip stops . Each successive extension requires a higher stress and is accompanied by the appearance of another slip line , which is actually the intersection of a slip plane through the crystal with the surface of the wire . The slip planes are found to be parallel to the basal plane of the hexagonal zinc crystal . Figure 48 shows the stress-strain diagram for such a crystal with the gradual rise of stress and the constant amount of elongation per movement , and Fig. 47 shows the appearance of the surface of the specimen after a great many movements have taken place . It resembles that of a pack of cards which has been pushed length- ' footnote Sorne of the more interesting methods of shaping metals industrially are illustrated on pp. 238 and 239 .

The tensile strength is only about one-tenth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed a model , Fig. 49a , in which he shows the slip planes parallel to the base of the hexagon for a zinc single crystal . Figure 49b shows the slip of fragments of the crystal parallel to the basal ( 0001 ) plane . This is the plane of densest atomic population in zinc . The inclination of this plane to the axis of the single crystal wire at the beginning of the test depended upon chance during the growth of the wire from the melt . As slip continues , this plane tends to become parallel with the axis of tension as shown in Fig. 49c . The direction of slip on this plane is not the direction of greatest stress , shown by the long arrow , but is one of three directions parallel to the three pairs of parallel sides of the hexagon , namely c ( C Fia . 49. - Model of a zinc single crystal .

This direction is one of the three directions of densest atomic population in the zinc crystal . As slip proceeds , this direction gradually becomes parallel with the tension axis . Hence we may say that both the plane of slip and the direction of slip tend to rotate into the axis of tension as deformation proceeds . If they had ( by chance ) been at right angles to the tension axis in the beginning , or at such an angle that the component of stress parallel to the plane of slip were too small to produce slip , then fracture would take place without slip .

The greater tendency to slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in Fig. 51 . A small ball was pressed into the surface of an iron single crystal with the result that a four-cornered impression was produced , due to the lower flow pressure at each corner as compared with that at 45 deg. to the corners . In the polycrystalline part of the specimen the impressions are truly spherical due to the fine grain size and random orientation of the grains . Slip vs . Crystal Structure. ? While there is only one plane of slip active in the hexagonal lattice at room temperature , namely , that of the base of the hexagon , there are many in the facecentered cubic , namely the four sets of octohedral planes , so that in this case slip may occur at first on one set of planes and then on another . For this reason , as would be expected , the metals crystallizing in the cubic system , such as , for instance , iron , copper , gold , and aluminum , are much more plastic and formable than those which follow the hexagonal system , as zinc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its slip processes , zinc was chosen for the above cited experiment . The planes and directions of slip for a number of metal crystals are given in Table V. The force parallel to a slip plane and slip direction , necessary to produce the first slip in a crystal , is given in Table VI . figure  | figure for magnesium single crystals .

( Polanyi. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curvature of the slip surfaces , or ( 3 ) by the elastic limit of the metal . r The most remarkable feature of the deformation of a metallic crystal is the self-stopping of slip once started , and the ability JoFFi , " The Physics of Crystals , " p. 48 , McGraw-Hill Book Company , Inc. , New York , 1928.  | of the adjacent fragments to cling to each other instead of separating as in fracture . The plasticity of crystalline material thus depends upon its ability to form slip planes . If it can not , it will be brittle . Another remarkable feature is that the pressure required to cause slip on the first plane is lower than that required for subsequent ( parallel ) planes . figure ( Polanyi . ) Deformation by Twinning . There is in addition to translation and bending another mode of deformation known as twinning . This consists in a shifting , as a whole , of a part of a crystal , to a second position , symmetrical with respect to a certain plane in the lattice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is illustrated in Fig. 56 . A ( a ) ( b ) figure In mechanical twinning , each atom moves a certain distance relative to the neighboring plane , and this is usually a small fraction of the full distance between atoms on the shearing ( twinning ) plane . The relative movement from plane to plane is thus the same throughout the structure . The total movement at any point relative to the original twinning plane ( where the process started ) is proportional to the distance from this plane ; hence the process is pure shear . When the reorientation has been effected the two parts of the crystal , original and twinned ,  | stand structurally in the relation of a mirror and its image , symmetrical with respect to the original twinning plane ; or , as in the case of zinc , some further ( slight ) adjustment of the atoms may occur to perfect the lattice in its new ( twinned ) orientation . ' Mathewson believes that it is this slight instantaneous shift completing the shear which accounts for the noise known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the new orientation so produced is usually more favorable for slip , so that twinning is frequently a forerunner of slip . The appearance of combined twinning and slip is shown in Fig. 57 . Twins form most readily in some metals , such as iron , when it is deformed by sudden shock . In the case is not necessary . Thus it is clear that the deform n of a metallic crystal takes place by slipping , bending , and rotation , or by twinning of crystal fragments , or by a combination of all four processes . Slip usually takes place most readily parallel to the planes of r1G. 57. - Slip hands in a densest atomic population and in the twinned crystal of alpha bronze . direction of densest atomic population X 190 . ( Czochralski. ) on these planes , although recent studies show that these conditions may change with the temperature . For this reason , probably , those crystals having the largest number of planes of dense atomic population , as for example the face-centered cubic , have the greatest formability , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip . The stress required to cause the first slip is the elastic limit or destruction limit of the crystal . It is a definite quantity for each metal , but varies with the temperature . Frictional resistance to slip increases as slipping continues until finally the stress rises far enough to produce slip in a new plane . ' ' 1 MATHEWSON and EDMUNDS , Trans . A.I.M.E. , 1928 , Iron and Steel Div. , p. 311. 2 Recent studies indicate that slip in one plane , say ( 111 ) , increases the resistance to slip in some other plane , say ( 111 ) , more than it does on the operative plane .  | Bending of the slip planes occurs during deformation and rotation of the crystal fragments to bring the slip planes and slip directions more nearly parallel to the direction of stress . Single crystals are quite weak as compared with ordinary metallic objects . The Deformation of Polycrystalline Material . The simplest transition from single crystal to polycrystalline material is illustrated in the experiment of Polanyi in Fig. 58 . Two zinc single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension it is noted that there is decreased deformation at the point of junction of the two crystals . The same effect is apparent in Fig. 59 . The general effect of polycrystallinity is an increase in the resistance to deformation at the grain boundaries , resulting from t the mutual hindrance to , slip by the abutting of Flo . 58 neighboring grains . A magnesium single crystal ( a ) Two zinc with holes bored in it will break outside the holes as crystals welded together shown in Fig. 60 simply because the holes interfere laterally ; ( t , ) with slip at the drilled places . Similarly , longitudi- ( Polanyi.ded. nal scratches on a tension specimen caused the specimen to be nearly twice as strong and half as ductile as an unscratched one . In general , the more crystallites there are in a Fm . 59. - Coarse- grained tungsten bar , showing obstructed deformation at grain boundaries .

This effect of grain size is shown more  | clearly in Figs. 61a and 61b . Only the component of the force parallel to the plane of slip in each grain is effective . The more frequently the direction of slip changes , the less effective is the force in producing rupture . The effect of grain size on tensile strength ( Fig. 62 ) and on Brinell hardness ( Fig. 63 ) is less marked , except in very coarsegrained material . ' figure Figure 64 shows the surface of the metal in a polycrystalline object of iron before and after deformation . There is an increasing number of nearly parallel , fine lines across the face of each crystallite as deformation progresses . This experiment may be performed easily by gripping lightly in a vise a cube of copper or iron , the upper face of which is highly polished and etched to show the grain boundaries as in Fig. 64a . If a microscope is mounted over the specimen and the pressure on the specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain , then in another , as is shown in Fig. 64b . These slip lines are , of course , the intersections of i Upton claims that similar data plotted as grains per linear millimeter show a straight line relationship of grain size to hardness.  | the bent slip planes ( such as were found in the single crystals of zinc ) , with the plane of polish of the specimen . Slip occurs first in that grain whose orientation was such , with respect to the direction of the applied stress , that one of its planes of easiest slip was at 45 deg. to the direction of flow of the metal under the action of the force . A section through two of these grains at right angles to the page would show the actual vertical displacement of the blocks with respect to each other .

( Edwards-Pfeil. )  | In some metals the grains move with respect to each other before slipping begins within the grains . Tammann says this is the case for Fe , Ni , Zn , and Mg . In gold and copper the slip planes appear first . ( a ) ( b ) 64. - Structure of iron ( a ) before straining ; ( h ) same field after straining . X 150 . ( Roscnhain. ) - Diagram illustrating the optical behavior of slip bands . ( Rosenhain . ) As the plastic deformation of a polycrystalline metal proceeds , the individual grains elongate in the direction of flow . The progressive change of grain shape during the drawing down of a wire from 5 gage to 11 gage is shown in Fig. 66 . The grains iii a  | wire would be expected to become somewhat cylindrical or spindle shaped , whereas in rolling they would become thin , flat strips .

Slip in many grains and figure in several directions in each grain accounts for the smooth and uniform spherical contraction at the " neck " of a polycrystalline iron tension specimen ( Fig. 68 ) , as contrasted with the flat fracture in a zinc single crystal . Deformation of a polycrystalline body appears , therefore , more complicated than that of a zinc single crystal but quite comprehensible in terms of the single crystal , and the two joined single crystals , under similar conditions of deformation . Fiber Structure. ? Just as deformation of the zinc single crystal in Fig. 49 is accompanied by a rotation of the planes of  | slip into the tension axis , so in the deformation of a polycrystalline object , whether of zinc or any of her metal , Ow principal planes of slip tend progressively to orient themselves parallel to the direction of flow of the metal as deformation proceeds . .

Joseph Winlock . ) Fi 68. - " Neck , " showing uniform contraction of a polycrystalline tension specimen . ( Sachs . ) The structure so produced is called a " fiber structure . " It is illustrated schematically in Fig. 70b as contrasted with 69b . Table VII gives the fiber structures of a number of metals after deformations of two types tension and compression . Fiber or texture structures in deformed metals are important in engineering work because the orderly alignment of the grains with respect to each other so produced results in marked directional properties in the object . It may be very weak if stressed  | in eertnin direct Ions , : Ind genernll Iow in IiIastieity , as il ' it were coarsely crystalline . For example , extruded magnesium rods have the basal plane of the hexagon oriented parallel to the length of the rod . Since compression parallel to this plane causes twinning , these rods are relatively weak in compression , having a yield point of 14 kg. per square millimeter as against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , as the forging of magnesium alloys proceeds , further reduction becomes difficult because all the basal planes soon lie nearly parallel to the anvil . If a 30 per cent reduction by forging is followed by a 10 per cent stretch , partially undoing the previous step , a superior product is obtained at less cost . Stead 's brittleness in lowcarbon steels has been explained as a result of fibering . The slip planes of adjacent fine grains may register rather exactly with each other , and fracture shows the broad crystalline planes of a coarse-grained material .  | Contrary to the original supposition , metals of the same lattice type do not always develop the same fiber structure . Von Goler and Sachs ' have shown that aluminum and silver , both face-centered cubic metals , do not develop the same fiber structure during rolling . Rationalization of Certain Fiber Structures. ? In the careful experiments of Taylor and Elam in stretching single crystal wires of face-centered cubic metals , such as aluminum , slip is found on the system ( plane and direction ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axis of the specimen and the slip direction approach one another , soon giving rise to a condition in which another slip system becomes equally stressed , whereupon both participate equally and the reorientation is now such as to bring a direction symmetrical to the two slip directions in question into the axis of the wire . This is the 112 direction which thus becomes the fiber axis in such single-crystal deformation . Passing on to polycrystalline deformation , the above fiber axis is not obtained because of restrictions or complications in the slip process , of adjacent crystallites . Actually , in stretchI Z. Physik , Band 56 , FIeft 7 and 8 , 1929 . Frequency of both positions  | ing a polycrystalline face-centered cubic wire , 110 becomes the principal fiber axis , and E. Schmid has shown that this would indeed result from a process in which the three most highly stressed slip systems are considered to operate simultaneously . Furthermore , the same method of analysis yields the second preferred fiber axis 100 in the case of grains originally found within a certain range of orientation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis based upon slip on the most highly stressed system together with rotation around an axis located in the slip plane at right angles to the slip direction . ( After partial deformation , a second system participates as in the Taylor and Elam experiments . ) At elevated temperatures the slip system sometimes changes , as in the case of aluminum . Above a certain temperature , slip begins to take place on the 11001 planes in the 100 direction . The entire hardening phenomenon changes . Similar rationalization of compression and rolling textures has been offered by the same authors . Fiber Pattern . Since fiber structure is a preferred orientation of grains , the X-ray powder pattern of such object should show not continuous circles such as result from a random orientation but rather spots on these circles corresponding to the preferred positions of the crystallites in the object , and between these spots blank spaces representing the orientations deserted by the crystallites during deformation . Figures 69 and 70 show the patterns of fibered and unfibered steel sheet . Figure 39 shows the diffraction pattern of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The method of stereographic projection described on page 42 is frequently used to represent the orientations of the grains in a fibered object . Because the poles in a stereographic projection are true points this method of representing orientations , strictly , can be used only for single crystals . However , its basic principles can be used to illustrate the positions of the individual grains in a polycrystalline aggregate . Such a diagram is called a " face pole figure . " This is best considered as a composite projection of the orientations of each of the large number of individual grains which constitute the aggregate . For simplicity , a separate pole figure is usually plotted for each of the two or hree least complex families of lattice planes . It can be  | easily visualized that , if a completely random grain orientation exists , the individual poles would fall in every conceivable position on the projection and , as a result , the density of coverage would be uniform . On the other hand , if certain orientations are preferred by large numbers of grains certain areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As this preference increases , the extent of these dense areas will decrease until the ideal position is attained for which all of the crystals have the same orientation , and the pole figure becomes a true stereographic projection ( Dr. Carl Samans ) . P P 71a. - Pole figure . Posi- Fa : . 71b. - Positions of octations of cube faces in rolled hedral planes in rolled aluminum aluminum sheet ( Wever. ) sheet ( Wever . ) In Fig. 71 , a and b are shown face pole figures of the cube and octahedral planes , respectively , of a cold-rolled aluminum strip . In this representation the rolled strip is considered to be so placed that the rolling direction D is normal to the plane of the page and the surface of the strip is parallel to the top of the page , thus making the direction P normal to the rolling plane , vertical , and the transverse direction C horizontal . The shaded areas , then , indicate stereographically the preferred positions of the poles in question . If an octahedral , 111 , direction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an octahedral pole at the point D , then cube poles can be located in the positions indicated by open circles in Fig. 71a , and octahedral poles in the corresponding positions in Fig. 71b . It can be readily seen that such a preferred orientation will , with a reasonable scattering , account for the shaded areas in both the pole figures .  | Flow Figures . It can be proved mathematically that an imaginary specimen , say in tension , with slip planes available at all possible angles to the tension axis , will slip first on that plane which is at 45 deg. to the axis . If a specimen happens to contain a number of crystallites so oriented that their slip planes are in this position , slip will take place first in these grains and will result in extensive deformation of these particular regions . The result is shown in Fig. 72 . The lines are known as " Ltiders lines . " In sheet-metal stamping and in deep drawing of sheets they are called " stretcher strains . " When a mild-steel specimen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible region . Owing to the drop of yield point ( described on page 267 , Chap . XI , Testing ) the flow at this region is extensive . Finally this region self-hardens , perhaps by strain aging ( q.v. ) , and flow begins in another region and again is self-stopping after a band has formed . The result is a network of depressed bands across the specimen , called by sheet-metal workers " worms . " When deformation is extensive , they spread and cover the entire surface and are no longer visible separately . The Changes in Properties Accompanying Plastic Deformation. ? =i'hat the properties of a metal should change appreciably when it is plastically deformed is perhaps surprising at first Flow figures in cast steel in the early stages of compression . ( Meyer and Nchl. )  | thought . That these changes , particularly those in the mechanical properties of the metal , should be such as to raise appreciably the strength and hardness of the metal is even more surprising . It will therefore be quite interesting to examine these changes more closely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original properties of a metallic body . Perhaps the most outstanding changes in a metal due to cold deformation are the changes in mechanical properties ? the rise in tensile strength , yield strength , and hardness ( not however the scratch hardness ) , and the decrease in plasticity and formability . These changes are shown for a mild steel in Fig. 73 and nicely illustrated for cold-drawn wire in Fig. 66 . The yield strength of iron may rise from 25,000 up to 125,000 lb. per square inch . The proportional limit of the metal rises also . The modulus of elasticity may rise as much as 20 per cent in some metals , but in steel it remains practically unchanged . The " stiffness " of a metal member in service is thus dependent upon its modulus of elasticity and is not increased ( against stresses within the elastic range where service stresses usually are ) by cold working . This fact is frequently overlooked by designers  | of metal structures . The proportional limit of the metal rises also . As is well known , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend . As the hardness rises the formability falls , causing the wire to break off short after several bends . The copper wires for electric power transmission are hardened and strengthened by drawing through the die . Their elastic limit is raised . Hence longer spans between poles can be used without danger of the wires breaking in a storm . The metal immediately adjacent to a punched rivet hole is hardened in this way also . The new streamlined trains are made of stainless steel whose elastic limit has been raised from some 80,000 up to 150,000 lb. per square inch by cold rolling . This ability of metals to harden under deformation is of very great importance in another way . Pitch or molasses if pressed into a die would yield at one point , become thin and tear through at this point . In metals the thin part hardens and shifts the deformation to the thicker parts , thus causing a uniform deformation instead of a localized one . Without this property of work hardening all deep drawing of metals would be impossible . Not all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impact resistance diminishes so that , for example , a heavy crane chain when overloaded will stretch plastically and thereafter be weaker against sudden impact . Other properties also are changed by cold forming . The electrical conductivity of a metal is decreased , sometimes by several per cent , due to cold deformation . Cold-drawn tungsten is affected greatly , while pure aluminum is affected only slightly in this respect . Hard-drawn copper wire may have a conductivity 3 per cent lower than the same wire before drawing . The temperature coefficient of electrical conductivity decreases also . The magnetic permeability decreases . Furthermore the electrochemical potential of a metal is increased by cold deformation , as shown for several metals in Table VIII . If a metallic pipe is bent , an e.m.f. is set up between the bent ( deformed ) and the adjacent portions of the pipe . This e.m.f. in the presence of an electrolyte , as salt or alkaline water , sometimes leads to rapid electrolytic corrosion at the bend .

Since the sum of all internal stresses must be zero , this decrease in density can not he found in an expansion of the metal but may be sought in the formation of space canals formed within the crystallites by extensive deformation . The formation of internal cracks would aid in this change . The coefficient of expansion changes during cold working only if the metal deformed crystallizes in a non-regular system such as hexagonal form of zinc and cadmium . This change is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crystallites in different directions and to the fibered arrangement of crystallites within the object produced by deformation ( see Fiber Structure , page 83 ) . The thermoelectric force changes during deformation , so that a thermocouple may be made of a cold-drawn wire and an annealed wire of the same material . This fact explains the necessity of using unstrained wires in the resistance pyrometer . The color changes , the rate of vaporization rises , as does also the rate of diffusion , due to cold deformation . These changes , not all of them desirable , in so many properties of a metal upon cold deformation are rather surprising . We are led to imagine that cold working has produced some rather profound changes in the internal structure of the object . In the second section following we shall see to what extent this is true . Internal Stress. - In addition to the changes in physical and chemical properties , internal stresses , often of a very high ioten-of  | city , may be left in an object after cold deformation . In this condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season cracking , " especially if subjected to corrosive action such as sea water and industrial gases supply . These internal stresses represent an increase in internal energy . Hort finds an increase in internal energy of from 0.9 to 5 cal . per gram-atom of deformed material . Other investigators find that the total internal energy of the object increases 13% per cent for steel , 8 to 9% per cent for copper , 7 to 8 per cent for aluminum , with drastic deformation . Distribution of internal stresses in a bar of cold-rolled nickel . ( Heyn . ) The presence of internal stresses may be revealed ' by taking a light cut off the surface of a cylindrical bar which has been cold drawn . The length of the bar increases after each cut ; or layers may be removed by dissolving them in acid . Plotting the stress distribution ( calculated from the change in length and the modulus of elasticity of the metal ) throughout the cross section of a cold-drawn bar of nickel shows in Fig. 74 that the surface layers of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compression . Removal of the surface layers ( in tension ) permits the compressed core material to expand and the piece to lengthen . In rolling , this stress distribution is caused by the greater extension of the surface layers of the object which are The internal stresses iii cold-drawn brass tubing are nicely revealed by inunersing it in a solution containing 100 g . HgNO3 , 13 cc . HNO3 in 1000 cc . ILO . The tubing splits almost innnediately.  | gripped by the rolls , as compared with the lesser extension of the core . These internal or initial stresses may be as high as 20,000 or 30,000 lb. per square inch or higher . If a member of a structure were understood to have a tensile strength of 40,000 lb. per square inch and contained an internal stress of 30,000 lb. , when only 10,000 lb. external load had been added , it might fracture . Attempts to Explain Work Hardening. ? We have now noted the more important changes in properties which accompany figure polycrystalline deformation . We have surveyed previously the mechanism of deformation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains now to attempt a logical explanation for these changes in properties on the basis of what we know of crystal structure and metallic structure , and of the observed changes in these structures during deformation . Since the change in hardness is of very great importance , it has received the most attention . First of all we noticed that the slip planes were not true planes but bent ones . This bending indicates an increase in the resistance to slip . Furthermore , we know from the experiments with zinc crystals that there is rotation of the crystal during deformation . Again , the surfaces of slip may suffer a roughening of atomic dimensions thus increasing the frictional resistance to slip and raising the potential energy of these surfaces . The  | reorientation effect would be less active in promoting hardness in the case of a polycrystalline material in the cubic system than it was in the case of zinc . In the cubic system there is always a number of slip planes of the same family , which could replace each other . For instance , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . The maximum resistance to slip is reached thus when the competing slip planes are all oriented Interference Lines of the Ka Roidiation of Copper Fie . 77. -I ) ebye patterns of a tungsten wire deformed and then annealed at various temperatures . ( von Goler and Sachs. ) symmetrically to the axis of stress . Reorientation does not , therefore , seem sufficient to explain work hardening . Early supposition indicated that the effect of deformation was a more or less complete destruction of the space lattice of the crystallites . Laue photographs show a pronounced asterism as illustrated by comparison of Figs. 75 and 76 , apparently due to bending of the lattice planes . The Debye patterns , however , show very little change in the lattice dimensions as shown in Fig. 77 and this change appears to be less than 2 per cent and within the elastic limit . The interference patterns are a little less sharp in severely deformed metals , it is true , as shown by the  | broadening of the interference lines . But this change is due principally to reorientation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformation or flow in crystals leaves the space-lattice structure of the crystals essentially unchanged because the particles follow only certain paths . In the flow of liquids , the particles follow no prescribed path . Tammann believes that deformation produces some subatomic change , which results in a homogenization of the internal field of force in the crystal and , therefore , in hardening . Polanyi also leans to such a view as would include a quantum change in the atom ; but these are merely speculations at present . We are left , therefore , without any entirely satisfactory explanation for the important changes in properties which we have observed to result from the deformation of metals . The mechanism of deformation , however , seems now clearly described : Slip takes place with bending of the slip planes and rotation of the crystal . It begins in that grain which has its plane and direction of easy slip most favorably oriented with respect to the applied force . Slip resistance increases in this plane , and other planes parallel to it begin to slip . Eventually other planes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to slip . Twinning may occur , and when it does it usually presents a more favorable orientation for slip . Finally most of the grains have taken up a symmetrical orientation with respect to the direction of stress ; cracks and internal fissures open up , and the specimen parts . The Amorphous-cement Theory . No discussion in the English language of the causes of work hardening would be complete without mention of the amorphous-cement theory proposed originally by Beilby and modified notably by Rosenhain and by Jeffries . This theory postulates that films of atoms in the disordered or amorphous state are left between each of the grains of a casting after solidification is complete . These atoms are attracted equally by the two neighboring lattices and therefore join neither of them . Since these atoms are not in any crystal , they constitute " amorphous " metal . This " amorphous metal " is similar in properties to liquid metal , in that it is lower in conductivity and density , etc. , than crystalline metal ; but as a supercooled liquid like glass is hard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip planes , so this amorphous  | metal is assumed to be hard at room temperature , and to increase the hardness of the entire piece of metal in which it exists as a continuous network . Deformation of a metallic object at temperatures far removed from the melting point is understood to increase the quantity of amorphous material in it . This increase takes place in two ways : First , the movement at grain boundaries during deformation increases the thickness of the existing intergranular films by tearing atoms out of the contact surfaces of adjacent grains . Second , slip within the grain results in tearing atoms out of the opposite faces of the slipping planes and thus produces films of amorphous metal within the grains . The increase in hardness of the metal is understood to be due to the increase in amount of this hard , amorphous material at the grain boundaries and in the slip planes . The decrease in density accompanying cold work is understood likewise to be due to increase in the amount of amorphous material . The decrease in electrical conductivity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also the increase iii e.m.f. , and rate of solution , since liquid metal partakes of these changes in properties , that is , decreased density , conductivity , and resistance to solution , as compared with crystalline metal . While glass is very hard at ordinary temperatures , it softens at higher temperatures and flows easily . Metals stressed slowly at elevated temperatures fail , not by transcrystalline fracture as they do at lower temperatures , but by intercrystalline fracture shown for a bronze specimen in Fig. 26 . This pulling apart of the grains at higher temperature is said to be due to the rapid softening of the amorphous material ( decrease in viscosity ) as compared with the slower softening of the crystalline grains as the temperature is raised . Obviously , at some temperature the cohesion at grain boundaries will be just equal to the crystalline cohesion . This temperature is called the " equicohesive temperature " and has been determined for several metals . The amorphous-cement theory thus explains well many of the experimentally observed properties of metals . It meets , however , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amorphous metal at temperatures so far below the melting point is difficult to accept even as a surface phase . Again it is observed that  | whereas a metal hardens during tension , reversal of the applied stress , that is , compression following stretching , actually shows less hardening or even softening as compared with the original state . To account for this fact , it would be necessary to assume anisotropism and therefore directional properties in the amorphous ( isotropic ) cement . Furthermore , investigation of a polished metal surface by X-rays at a glancing angle reveals that it is crystalline , not amorphous as Beilby originally supposed . These and other objections have led to the discarding of this useful theory by most authorities in the field . The theory is valuable , however , as a means of remembering the nature of the changes produced in metals by deformation . Jeffries has combined with the amorphous-cement theory another explanation for the hardening of deformed metals . He points out that the earlier slip of fragments of a crystalline grain produces increasing disregistry of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to this increase in disregistry of slip planes . The theory seems plausible . He assigns to the amorphous cement a secondary role in the hardening process . THE ANNEALING OF DEFORMED METAL The Instability of the Deformed State. ? Whatever theoretical explanation of the work hardening of metal is adopted , the workhardened state with its high hardness and strength , its greatly decreased plasticity , its lower conductivity , and its internal stresses must be recognized as an abnormal one and as one of unstable equilibrium . If the temperature is raised , equilibrium begins to return and the normal properties of the metal are gradually recovered . The heating of a cold-worked object to or above a temperature at which equilibrium begins to return is called annealing . Stress Relief. ? As the temperature of a cold-worked object is gradually raised , the first change to take place is relief of the internal stresses . The displaced atoms in the elastically distorted space lattice spring back to their equilibrium positions . A " light anneal " will relieve these stresses almost completely and without appreciable loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardness may rise slightly . For instance , cold-  | worked brass ( Fig. 78 ) such as cartridge shells and condenser tubing , annealed at 200 ? to 250 ? C. , is freed practically ( although not entirely ) from internal stress and enjoys a slight increase in hardness and tensile strength over the cold-worked condition . The miscrostructure remains unchanged during this treatment . This low-temperature treatment is called stress relief . It permits crystal recovery . It is quite important industrially as a means of conditioning work-hardened metal for safe use . Softening . At a higher temperature softening begins after a short interval of induction and proceeds rapidly , reaching completion within a very short time . The temperature range of partial softening is a narrow zone of temperature , especially for copper , as shown in Fig. 79 . As annealing continues , all of the properties , such as hardness , strength , and yield point ( which represent resistance to deformation ) , decline completely or nearly to their original values . The formability , as measured by elongation and reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Changes in Microstructure Recrystallization . Accompanying these changes or lagging behind them slightly , as far as can be observed , there is taking place in the interior of the metal a rather profound change of structure . In t5e grain boundaries  | and iii the slip planes of the deformed grains , crystal nuclei spring up . Whether these are true nuclei or merely very small crystalline fragments torn out of the grains during deformation is not certain . At any rate , these crops of nuclei " spring up " throughout the metal at these points and grow , as they do in a cooling melt , so that , as heating continues , the distorted grain structure resulting from cold working is entirely replaced by one of fine grains , often nearly equiaxial in shape . Figure 80 shows at 300 ? C. several clusters of new grains growing iii the Effect of cold rolling and annealing on the properties of copper . ( Mathewson and Thalheimer. ) cold-worked brass and at 350 ? the completely recrystallized metal . The new grains are not a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phenomenon is called recrystallization . In terms of the amorphous-cement theory , nuclei have formed in the amorphous metal , just as they do in liquid metal below the freezing point , and growth from these nuclei has proceeded throughout the shattered grains . ( Recrystallization following cold work must not be confused with the change in grain structure accompanying the appearance of a new and different polymorphic form as alpha iron from gamma iron . ) When recrystallization is just complete , and when all of the distorted , cold-worked structure has given way to the finegrained equiaxial structure , as shown at 350 ? in Fig. 80 , the metal is in a mos'c desirable condition .

Even after recrystallization is complete , it may be noted in passing , the orientation of the crystallites in a fibered object does not become random until a '  - -  temperature near that of the Coarse Coarse absorbing each other . The phenomenon is called grain Very coarse Unrecryetallized growth .

( Hansen-Evans. ) cold-worked brass are shown in Fig. 80 . The inferior properties of coarse-grained metals are described on page 80 . If cold work is to be resumed after annealing , as in wire drawing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the coarse-grained material does not harden so rapidly in subsequent deformation as does fine-grained material . Three Factors Governing Grain Size after Annealing. 1 . Temperature of Anneal. ? In general , when a cold-worked object is annealed , the higher the annealing temperature , the larger will be the grain size and the softer and more plastic the metal which results ( Figs. 78 , 79 , and 80 ) . The temperature at which recrystallization begins is lower the more drastic the previous deformation of the object . If the deformation has been slight , a relatively higher temperature is necessary to produce a change . Thus , in Fig. 81 the tapered aluminum specimen was deformed in tension in inverse proportion to its thickness at every point . Annealing at 480 ? C. caused the slightly deformed part , near the Very fine Very fine melting point is reached . Grain Growth . If the tern-Fine Fine perature is raised farther , these new crystallites grow in size by  | base to form a very coarse grain size , while at the lower temperature of 450 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The degree of deformation may be expressed in reduction of area divided by original area . ) Lead , as shown on page 244 , recrystallizes spontaneously at room temperature , even if only slightly deformed . This spontaneous recrystallization accounts for the inability to harden lead permanently by cold working at room temperature . Fie . 82. -Recrystallization diagram of a 0.18 per cent carbon steel . No change is observable after one hour of anneal . ( Oberhoffer and Jungbluth. ) 2 . Degree of Previous Deformation. ? The grain size resulting from annealing is dependent also upon the degree of previous deformation , as seen in the tapered bar ( Fig. 81 ) . The greater the previous deformation ( near the fracture ) , the smaller the grain size obtainable upon annealing . Thus , in severely deformed metal the grain size after annealing may be much finer than in the original ( Fig. 80c ) . This grain refinement is often of great practical value . These relationships of grain size , degree of previous deformation , and temperature of anneal are shown for a mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slight deformation such as about 10 per cent in iron may lead to extremely large grain size . This condition is called " germination . " The temperature range within which the abnormally large grains are found is called the " germinative temperature . "  | It should be noticed in this diagram that while lower degrees of deformation lead to larger grain size , zero deformation does not yield a maximum grain size . In fact , undeformed nonpolymorphic metal , such as a cast object , undergoes no change in grain size at any temperature below its melting point . A certain minimum or threshold degree of deformation is necessary to yield a change on annealing . This has been explained in terms of a shell of impurities around each grain , which insulates it . This shell must be broken before growth across the boundary can take place . Thus Jeffries has shown that 1 per cent of thorium oxide prevents the development of coarse grains in the tungsten filaments of lamps , although they are heated to incandescence for a long time . A coarse grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . The Time of Anneal. ? The time of annealing also is important . The lower the temperature , provided , of course , it is above the minimum recrystallization temperature , the longer the time required for the grain structure and properties to reach equilibrium at that temperature . Table IX shows how remarkably a very small reduction in temperature increases the time required for deformed iron to reach the completely annealed condition . Finally , however , at each temperature an equilibrium grain size is reached and no further change takes place . If deforma- TABLE TX. ? EQUIVALENT TIMES FOR ANNEALING IRON AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES TO ATTAIN A CONSTANT GRAIN SIZE ( White and Wood ) 8 min 675 ? C 24 min 650 ? 3Zhr 600 ? 321hr 550 ? Lion is repeated , however , then annealing will again produce the changes described above . The initial grain size also exerts an influence on its temperature and time of recrystallization . Grain Growth without Recrystallization. ? Instead of recrystallization followed by grain growth , the latter may occur alone , if the material is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iron mentioned above . The slightly distorted grains increase in size and decrease in number . The general effect of degree of deformation upon grain size is shown in Fig. 83 , of a tin sheet through which two bullets have been  | shot . The sheet was subsequently annealed at 200 ? C. The degree of deformation is a maximum at the holes and shows the finest grain size there . The grain size increases gradually as the degree of deformation diminishes until a ring of very coarse grains appears , beyond which the original structure is unchanged . Similar results are shown in Fig. 84 . By a repetition of 2 per cent elongation and annealing , single crystals of aluminum may be prepared . Since coarse-grained material is usually quite brittle , it is clear that if some parts of an object ( crank shaft ) are slightly deformed in manufacture , while other figure  | parts are highly deformed , there is danger of the annealing resulting in a very coarse grain size in the slightly deformed parts , with accompanying brittleness . Since these slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastically deformed parts , in order to produce a change in grain structure , the difficulty may be avoided by using a lower anneal-r Flu . 84. - Recrystallized aluminum bar after elongation ( from top of group toward bottom ) of 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 per cent , followed by annealing at 600 ? C. ( Czochralski. ) ing temperature and a longer time of anneal . This remedy , of course , sometimes interferes with low-cost production schedules . Fiber Structure in Annealed Objects. ? Instead of a random orientation , recrystallization may lead to a fiber structure . The fiber structure after annealing may be identical with the deformation fiber structure produced by cold deformation , or it may be a different one . The recrystallized fiber pattern for several metals is given in Table X.  | TABLE X.- - FIBER STROCTIIRE OF RECRYSTALLIZED METALS IN So FAR AS THEY DIFFER FROM DEFORMATION FIBERS ( Sauerwald ) Mode of Recrystal. deforma- Lattice type Metal temperature , Crystal orientation Remarks lion ?

Heating to a higher temperature restores to some extent the original properties of the metal . The grain size may be much finer or much coarser than it was originally , depending on the degree of previous deformation , the annealing temperature and , to some extent , upon the time of annealing . A certain minimum deformation is necessary if any change in structure of a casting is to be obtained . Purposes of Annealing. ? While the above discussion of cold working and annealing of metals seems at first to be of academic and theoretical interest only , a glance at Chap . IX , The Shaping of Metals , will impress one immediately with the wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In drawing wire through a die , the wire hardens . Its tensile strength rises but its proportional limit rises more rapidly , and soon the two values are close together . Its formability has decreased . In this condition the wire is brittle , that is , any stress above the proportional limit , and therefore able to elongate the wire , will also be quite close to the ultimate tensile strength of the wire . In this condition it would break frequently . Annealing reduces both values but reduces the proportional limit farther , and restores plasticity . Drawing may now proceed with less power and less danger of breakage until the metal has hardened and must again be annealed . Similar intermediate annealing is done in many such operations as deep drawing , stamping , and forging .  | Other articles are annealed to remove the internal or initial stresses from a previous deforming operation . Punched rivet holes , bent pipes or beams , etc. , are treated in this way . If not removed , these stresses added to the service stresses may cause failure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Furthermore , their gradual release in service , even without failure , may result in warping and distortion of the object with loss of alignment and necessity of re-machining . As we shall see , castings and welds , due to the contraction stresses during solidification and cooling , may be in a state of high internal stress . Annealing in these cases is carried out at a temperature high enough to render the metal plastic so that the stresses are relieved . While grain growth usually does not accompany this treatment , it is possible for the contraction stresses to deform the grains in some parts of the object to such an extent that these slightly deformed parts may undergo grain growth upon annealing . Objects are annealed also after quenching so that the severe contraction stresses may be partly relieved , as well as to alter the properties of the material . The latter type of annealing is also called " tempering " ( see Heat Treatment , Chap . X ) . Annealing is also carried out in some cases to remove gases from the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carried out more rapidly than softening can take place at that temperature , the metal will harden . Figure 85 shows that in the slow deformation of copper in a tension test the rate of hardening by working is slower than the rate of softening by annealing , when the temperature is 400 ? C. or above . Therefore , deformation carried out under these conditions is hot working . The metal does not harden under this treatment . If the deformation is rapid , as in hammer forging , the temperature at which hardening ceases is higher ( 800 ? C. ) , as shown in Fig. 86 . Thus , from the standpoint of its effect on the properties and structure of the metal , the temperature at which working is done is not significant unless it is accompanied by some knowledge of the rate at which deformation proceeds . Steel forged at 500 ? F. is said to be " finished cold , " while lead worked at room temperature behaves as if it were " hot worked . "  | " Finishing Temperature . " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temperature far above the recrystallization temperature ( " high finishing temperature " ) , then , during cooling Hardening of copper in tension test at various temperatures . ( Korber and Rohland . ) ( Rise in true unit stress indicates rise in hardness. ) down of the object to this temperature , grain growth progresses . This leads to a coarse grain size in the final object and to a low value of contraction of area in the tension test . If , on the contrary , deformation is continued until the temperature of the Hardness of copper after quenching from forging temperatures . ( Sauerwald and Giersberg. ) object is below the recrystallization temperature ( " low finishing temperature " ) , the plasticity of the metal may be insufficient and the object may crack in the operation . Ian the tension test ,  | metal finished too cold will show a high yield point but rather low contraction of area and elongation . The optimum finishing temperature yielding the finest grain size is , therefore , that which is as close as possible to the recrystallization temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object is likely to be hotter than the exterior , it is the surface temperature which is used as a guide . The grain size at the center will therefore be coarser than that at the surface ( sec also Shaping in the Solid State , page 237 ) . Dependence of tensile strength , elongation , notch toughness , and hardness of mild steel upon temperature . ( Oberhoffcr . ) The Formability of Metals at Various Temperatures . In general , the formability of metals increases with rise in temperature and their resistance to deformation decreases ( Fig. 87 ) . Thus forging , rolling , and stamping are usually , but not always , done upon hot objects while extruding is usually done as near to the melting point as possible . The velocity of extrusion often doubles for a 10 ? C. rise in temperature . There is thus less energy required in hot working and less danger of fracture or cracks . If the metal exists in a new polymorphic form at the higher temperature , however , as gamma iron above 910 ? C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of area  | as it does in iron ( Fig. 88 ) . In metals and alloys , there are important exceptions to this rule as , for example , the brittleness of iron and zinc below room temperature and of steel slightly above room temperature , the so-called " blue brittleness " as illustrated in Figs. 87 and 89. 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 000 Temperature in Deg.C. figure The Properties of Hot-formed Metals. ? In addition to refinement of grain size and elimination of a preferred orientation or cast structure , deformation and annealing crack up the shells of impurities encasing the grains and permit by diffusion the elimination , partial or complete . of crystal segregation or cored structure as discussed on page 139 et seq . The properties of the hot-worked object are improved proportionally over those of a cast object . Ingot segregation is little altered , owing to the greater distances necessary for diffusion . A hot-worked object , as for instance steel sheet , is usually st ranger and more formable in the direction of rolling than trans-  | verse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain boundaries and within the grains , as described on page Static and dynamic notched bar tests at various temperatures with cold-worked and with annealed mild steel .

The behavior of metals at elevated temperatures is important , not only in the shaping of metallic objects while hot as in forging , etc. , but in the use of metals at high temperatures , as in boilers , turbines , 1The change of other physical properties with temperature is discussed on p. 5 ( i et seq . Angle of Test Piece , Degrees  | chemical apparatus , and gas engines . The amount of deformation in a metal specimen under a steady load below the elastic limit over a given period of time is proportional in general to the stress , the temperature , and the time during which the stress is borne . Such slow deformation is called " creep . " 1 When a specimen , as for instance a bolt , is tightened cold and then used at a higher temperature , a part of the elastic stress set up in the bolt is gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change as it does in " creep . " This loss of elastic stress is called " relaxation . " If the bolt is removed its length will be greater than its length was before tightening but less than it was just before removal . A part of the elastic stress set up in the bolt by tightening has become plastic stress at the higher temperature . The alloys of cobalt with chromium , molybdenum , and tungsten ( for example , stellite and high-speed steel ) do not drop in tensile strength and hardness so rapidly as most metals ( for iron and steel , see Figs. 87 , 88 , 89 ) do at elevated temperatures , but at red heat they retain a tensile strength comparable with that of ordinary steels at room temperature . The brittleness of steel at low temperatures and in the blue-brittle range in the notchedbar test is shown in Fig. 89 . Figure 87 also shows the properties of steel at various temperatures . Complex Mechanical Properties. ? Although the conventional tension test turns out to be far from simple , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these are of importance . They include endurance , overstrain , recovery , resistance to wear , machinability . Creep . Fatigue. ? If a material remains loaded for a long period below its elastic limit , as determined in the conventional tension test , it may break in time . We have seen that polycrystalline objects possess no definite elastic limit . It is probable therefore that this stress really produces a plastic deformation of small magnitude in certain regions . The question arises whether there is any stress which given a long enough time will not lead to fracture . The stress may be applied periodically as iaa fatigue testing , or constantly in which case tests at higher temperatures are more important . ' For a comprehensive report on this subject see Proc . A.S.T.M. p . I18 , vol. 32 , 1932.  | Recovery and Aging. ? If a polycrystalline material is stressed below its elastic limit , elongation does not take place at once . Only gradually is a length reached which does not change . If the stress is removed , a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A part , however , does not disappear at once but only gradually . This phenomenon is called the elastic after effect . Single crystals do not show this phenomenon . Closely connected with it is the elastic hysteresis called the " Bauschinger effect . " In normal ( undeformed ) steel , if the stress is gradually raised until it passes the proportional limit , this limit if tested immediately afterward is higher than before the stress was applied . This result may be repeated . If , b owever , the stress is beyond the yield point , the proportional limit will sink and may reach zero . This condition is called " overstrain . " If deformed while in this labile condition , the metal will not show flow layers or " stretcher strains . " If allowed to " age , " that is , to lie at room temperature , or if heated in boiling water , the proportional limit returns to its original value or even above it . This behavior is called " strain aging . " Stress above the original yield point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change may continue . Similarly , stress above the original yield point lowers the modulus of elasticity , which returns , however , upon aging . Stress beyond the original proportional limit in tension lowers the proportional limit in compression and vice versa . The above characteristics apply to steel , and investigation of them will have to continue , perhaps for years , before adequate explanations are evolved . A knowledge of their existence is , however , of importance to engineers . Summary of Deformation and Annealing. ? In brief summary of the mechanical deformation and annealing of metals , we may say that the industrial forming operations produce amazing changes in the properties of the metals . The magnitude of these changes is different for the different properties . The greatest change occurs in the mechanical properties , including tensile and compressive strength , hardness , and resistance to bending . Less pronounced are the changes in permeability and electric conductivity , and even smaller is the change in energy content and volume . The deformation of metals takes place principally  | by slip of fragments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certain crystallographic laws along certain crystallographic planes , and in certain directions on these planes . As slip proceeds , the frictional resistance to slip increases so that slip is self-stopping . This increase in friction may be attributed to a change in the atoms in the slip planes . There is very little change in the distances between the planes of atoms . As deformation proceeds , the grains of the metal , originally oriented at random , gradually elongate and at the same time orient themselves in an orderly fashion with respect to the direction of flow , and a fiber structure develops in the metal . The cold-worked condition is an unstable one , but it persists permanently at low temperatures . If the temperature is raised , recovery from this abnormal state begins and the physical and chemical properties begin gradually to return to normal . At higher temperatures the deformed structure gives way to a new generation of crystallites , small at first , but growing gradually in size . If the degree of deformation has been slight , growth may occur without the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Metals and Metallic Compounds , " vol .

Profound changes in the properties of a pure metal may result if atoms of a second metal or atoms of a non-metallic element are combined or alloyed with it . Both the physical and the chemical properties of the metal maybe changed by the presence of the " foreign " atoms . The changes produced are more marked in the crystalline state of the metal than in either the liquid or the vapor state . Metallic combinations of two or more varieties of atoms are called in general alloys . Alloys are of great importance in industry and in the arts , in fact far more so , when quantitatively considered , than are the pure metals . Simple and alloy steels , the brasses and bronzes , aluminum alloys , bearing metals , cast iron and stainless steels recall at once the importance of this class .

Even if the alloy is to be composed of only two metals , or one metal and one non-metal , it is apparent that they may be combined in an infinite variety of proportions one to the other . In one instance a minute quantity of the one element , say 0.01 per cent , may be combined with 99.99 per cent of the principal metal , such as a trace of nickel in purified copper . In this case the minor metal may be termed an " impurity " in the major metal . In another instance the proportions may be 50 per cent of each metal , as in some of the commercial nickelcopper alloys ; or the proportions may be anywhere between these two extremes . Whether or not the presence of the foreign atoms in the alloy is intentional does not , of course , alter in the least their effects , either beneficial or deleterious , although the magnitude of the effects naturally may be less ' when the proportion of foreign atoms is small . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a second element may change profoundly the corrosion resistance , the electrical conductivity , the magnetic permeability , or even the mechanical properties of the major metal . The new oxygen-free copper seems to have remarkable toughness in the twisting test . Yet it differs from ordinary copper only by omitting the 0.03 to 0.08 per cent of oxygen . A few hundredths of a per cent of calcium in lead very greatly increases the strength , hardness , and endurance limit of the metal . Zinc also is much affected by small amounts of cadmium , and tin . Gold containing 0.005 per cent Pb is unworkable due to a eutectic at the grain boundaries . Bismuth in copper produces a network around the copper grains if 0.002 per cent bismuth is present . If more than 0.05 per cent bismuth is present , the copper can not be cold rolled . 0.01 per cent carbon in iron alters profoundly its magnetic properties . 0.01 per cent sulphur in nickel or 0.02 per cent sulphur in monel metal renders them so brittle that they fly to pieces if struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalyst . The striking " diseases " and " abnormalities " of metals which have attracted so much 1 SMITHELLS , " Impurities in Metals , " John Wiley &; Sons , Inc. , New York , 1930.  | superstitious attention in the past are , of course , merely instances in which our knowledge of the internal structure of the metals is incomplete . The Constitutional Diagram. ? If the internal structure of each of the many alloys possible between two given metals had to be described as to number of phases and as to the composition and mechanical arrangement of each phase after cooling to room temperature , it would involve very lengthy descriptions or tabulations . If the structures of each alloy changed with the temperature , as it usually does , and if the structure at other temperatures than room temperature were wanted also , the tabulation would be impossible to carry out practically . Fortunately all these descriptions can be incorporated in a simple diagram after the exploration of an alloy system has been carried out . Most of the possible binary diagrams have been obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of alloys ) . More recently the changes in volume , or electrical conductivity , or in lattice form or dimensions have been used . The experimental methods for their determination will not be given in this text . Obviously , however , it will be worth the while of those interested in the treatment and use of metals and alloys to learn to read and interpret the diagrams of this kind which are available . The general law which is expressed in all such constitutional diagrams , for , although very diverse in appearance , all such diagrams do conform to a general law , is called " Gibbs ' phase rule . " This rule prescribes the number of phases ( in a solidified alloy , the number of kinds of crystalline grains ) which may be present in a given alloy when it is at a given temperature and pressure . The rule assumes that the alloy is in complete equilibrium with its environment at this temperature and pressure and has , therefore , no tendency whatever to change its condition , however long a time may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a complete or " dead " annealing . The mechanical arrangement of these phases with respect to each other also can be inferred from the diagram . The base line or abscissa of the constitutional diagram in which these descriptions are contained shows the compositions of all possible alloys from 0 per cent of one metal and 100 per cent of the other metal at one end of the line to 100 per cent of the one metal and 0 per cent of the other at the other end of the  | line , for any two metals or non-metallic components . It is thus possible to represent any binary alloy by a point on this scale intermediate between its two extremes , as , for instance , 81 per cent of one component and 19 per cent of the other component , etc. , as shown at x in Fig. 92 . The vertical scale of the diagram represents the temperature range . Any point within the confines of the diagram as n , f , g , or x will therefore represent a particular alloy composition at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase 9 ? t2 mot o A - L. !

Solubility as Shown by the Constitutional Diagram. ? If such a diagram is to show completely the internal structure of all possible alloys formed between two components , it must show , first of all , how much of one component will dissolve in the other when mixed , that is , it must show the solubility of one component in the other . For certainly the character of the alloy will be different if , for example , the added element dissolves in the crystallites of the host metal than it would be if the additions were insoluble in the host crystals . Theoretically every metal can dissolve at least a trace of every other element , complete insolubility being thermodynamically impossible , but there are some metals which can dissolve large proportions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions in each other , both when liquid and when solidified . A familiar analogy is the complete solubility of alcohol and water in all proportions . Ether and water , on the contrary , if shaken up  | in a test tube will not dissolve completely but will separate into two layers ( two " phases " ) , the upper layer being , however , as a little thinking will convince one , not pure ether but ether saturated with water , and the lower layer not pure water but water saturated with ether . Increasing the amount of ether or water does not change the concentration of the two layers or phases , at least not until so much water ( or ether ) has finally been added that it dissolves all the other component and is thereby left unsaturated . Each will remain saturated in the other as long as the layers are in contact and free to diffuse , and merely the quantity of each phase will change . Oil and water may represent the other extreme in which the two components may be considered completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each other in the liquid state . Copper and lead , and zinc and lead ( Parkes process ) are examples of metals , however , which separate , even when liquid , into two layers , each layer containing very little of the other metal in solution . Metal pairs which are insoluble in the liquid state will not be considered further in this chapter . The alcoholwater , ether-water , and oil-water analogues will therefore be used to represent the solubilities of solidified metal pairs only . The constitutional diagram is a plot of these solubility relations and shows therefore the number and composition of crystalline or liquid phases present in any alloy at any temperature . For the ether-water type of solubility , it might appear as in Fig. 92 . A change in the pressure on a system will change the solubility relationship just as a change in temperature will do , but , since the effect of pressure on alloy systems is only beginning to receive study , most of the treatment of metals being done at atmospheric pressure , the pressure axis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or its reciprocal , concentration ) for a one-component systemwater ? is shown in Fig. 2 on page 13 . Two Rules for Interpreting Constitutional Diagrams . Let the distance Ac on the hypothetical diagram of Fig. 92 , chosen for simplicity , show that at 0 ? C ether dissolves c per cent of water , that is , about 13 per cent of water ( measured on the water composition scale below c ) . Water at this temperature then appears to dissolve d per cent of ether , that is , about 4 per cent of ether ( measured on the ether scale below d ) . At a  | higher temperature , as at t2 , the distance Ac has increased to t2f , showing an increased solubility of water in ether to about 18 per cent , which is natural to expect at the higher temperature . An increase has taken place also in the solubility of ether in water ( distance Bd to t2g ) to about 19 per cent owing to the rise in temperature . The increase in solubility need not be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so . At a still higher temperature , 13 , the two liquids are completely soluble in each other in all proportions . Separate layers of ether and water phases could not exist when equilibrium has been reached at this temperature . The line fc ( continued ) thus shows the changing solubility-limit of water in ether , and the line gd ( continued ) the changing solubility-limit of ether in water , as the temperature changes . The area between these lines is a region in which saturation is exceeded and two phases exist , namely , an ether solution saturated with water and a water solution saturated with ether , in contact with each other . ' Rule 1 . To ascertain the composition of the water layer and of the ether layer , when both are present ( which is possible by choosing certain total compositions ) at any chosen temperature below t3j one needs only to draw a horizontal exploring line at the chosen temperature . The intersections of this line with the two boundaries of the two-phase ( shaded ) field give ( by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two phases existing at that temperature . For instance , at temperature t2 the ether phase will contain f per cent water , the water phase g per cent ether . If the original total composition lies outside of the shaded area only one phase is present , being unsaturated , and its composition is , of course , the same as the original total composition of the sample . Rule 2 . Not only is the composition of each of the two phases which can be present at any temperature shown by this diagram but also the relative quantity of each of these two phases present in any chosen original composition is given . To determine the quantity of each phase , it is necessary only to erect a vertical line at 1 A lecture table experiment which illustrates clearly these changes of solubility with change in temperature is the heating in a Bunsen flame of a test tube containing equal parts of water and phenol . Two layers form at room temperature . They dissolve completely at 68 ? C. , and separate again into two layers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the point on the composition scale corresponding to the total composition of the mixture as point n in the example below . The point where this vertical line intersects the chosen temperature horizontal line t2 , may be considered the fulcrum of a lever system . The relative lengths of the lever arms ng and of multiplied by the amounts of the phases present must balance . For example , in a composition of 81 per cent water and 19 per cent ether , as shown at x on the diagram , there will be present in the alloy at temperature t2 , ng per cent of phase f and fgf per cent of phase g For , clearly , if the point n lay midway between f and g , there would be 50 per cent of each phase present , while if n lay at the point g , there would be none of phase f present . The lengths ng , fg , etc. , are read from the composition base line . A little consideration of these conditions will make these relations quite obvious . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g , are known from Rule 1 given in the paragraph above . These two rules thus give both the composition of each phase and the relative quantity of each of the two phases present in any binary system , whether these phases be two liquids as in the case of ether and water , or two varieties of crystals in a solidified alloy , such as cementite and ferrite in steel , or whether they be one liquid phase and one solid phase as in the pasty stage of a partly solidified alloy . They are the only two rules necessary in evaluating diagrams of binary alloys . ' Complete Solid Insolubility . The Eutectic Reaction. ? In addition to showing the composition and relative amounts of the phases present , the diagram shows the change of freezing point ( or what is the same thing , the change of " solubility of crystals in the liquid " ) as the composition of the alloy is changed . HoYT , " Metallography , " Pt . I : Principles , McGraw-Hill Book Cornpany , Inc. , New York , 1921 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Wiley &; Sons , Inc. , New York , 1909 .

Raoult 's law states that the freezing point of a pure substance will be lowered by the addition of a second substance ( provided the latter is soluble in the pure substance while liquid , and insoluble in it when solidified ) , the amount FP. - X ' of lowering being proportional I to the molecular weight of the t , Liquid solute . For an alloy of Raoult 's type , namely , one showing corni Ll. id and crystals A plete solubility of the two cornponents in each other when liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freezing point curve beginning at the freezing point of the pure metal and drooping steadily with each addition of the second substance as shown in Fig. 93 . This curve which Composition , Per cent A indicates the temperature at O 10 Composifio , Percent 50 60 which freezing begins for each figure is entirely liquid . This upper region is , therefore , a one-phase field ( neglecting the vapor phase ) and is not shaded . Immediately below the liquidus , the melt has begun to form solid crystals . Therefore , the region below the curve is a two-phase field containing one liquid and one crystalline phase ( instead of two liquid phases as in the etherwater analogue in the example of Fig. 92 ) and is shaded as is done also in the two-phase field in Fig. 92 . The quantity and composition of each of these two phases , one liquid and one crystalline , for any alloy at any temperature may be found by the two rules used just as they were used in interpreting Fig. 92 . For example , suppose that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x of two metals A and B  | instead of ether and water . As its temperature falls on cooling and crosses the liquidus curve at x ' , the liquid begins to deposit crystals ( not , it will be noted , at the freezing point of pure A but below it by Raoult 's law ) by the formation of nuclei , as described in Chap . I. Since metal A when solid is assumed to have no solubility whatever for B , it is obvious that the crystals of A deposited can contain no B but must be pure A. The broken horizontal line drawn at the point where x ' cuts the liquidus shows correctly , therefore , that the crystalline phase has composition 100 per cent A , the liquid phase composition x ' ( Rule 1 ) . If the melt were transparent it would reveal at this time crystals of pure A swimming in a liquid of composition x ' . This loss of pure A material by deposition from the liquid must impoverish the liquid in A and thus leave it richer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower freezing point than the x liquid , ( just as it would have , if we were to start with it instead of with the liquid x in our experiment ) . No further deposition of crystals from this liquid can take place therefore until its temperature has dropped slightly , when the deposition of pure A crystals will be resumed . These processes continue , the amount of the crystalline phase ( pure A ) increasing gradually by continued precipitation of A from the liquid , the liquid phase gradually decreasing in amount and travelling downward and to the right along the liquidus curve constantly becoming richer in B content and falling in temperature . At any temperature ti , the amount of the crystalline phase ( pure A crystals ) , will be np/op . That of the liquid phase ( of composition p ) will be on/op as was shown for the conventionalized ether-water diagram in Fig. 92 . Let us leave , for a moment , this side of the diagram and consider what would happen to an alloy nearer the B side , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 94 . Again the liquidus curve droops from the freezing point of pure B due to increase in the amount of A present in the melt according to Raoult 's law . The crystals deposited from this melt y containing 80 per cent of B , are pure B in accordance with our assumption of complete insolubility of each component in the other after solidification . The melt becomes richer in A as : a result and falls in temperature , moving downward and to the left along the liquidus . The condition might be stated by saying  | that whereas alloy x was saturated with A and deposited pure A crystals , alloy y is saturated with B and deposits pure B crystals . At temperature ti alloy y will consist of htl/kti per cent of liquid Liquid ' , FP ( of composition k ) , and kh/ktl per CL cent by weight of crystalline k h Cr stzls B material of composition t1 , that is , of pure B. It is possible that deposition of E pure B crystals might continue with continued fall in temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was pure A , as shown in Fig. 110 . The A Change of freezing point solidify in the usual manner for of liquid B when A is added to , or B pure metals and would appear at crystals are removed from , solution . the boundaries of the B crystals which were previously swimming in it while they grew . Usually , however , the two liquidus curves , the one dropping from A and The eutectic reaction . Liquid e precipitates crystals of f ( pure A ) alternately with crystals of g ( pure B ) . the one dropping from B , meet and intersect somewhere between A and B , as shown at e in Fig. 95 . Clearly , the liquid once  | arrived at this point of intersection e might have approached it either from the A side or from the B side of the diagram ; i.e. , previous to its arrival at this point , it might have been saturated in either A or B material , depending on what composition had been chosen originally . At this point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must therefore precipitate both kinds of crystals . The result is that it now precipitates alternately a crystal of A and one of B at various points in the remaining liquid , as fast as the heat set free by crystallization can be carried away , until solidification is complete , the temperature and the composition of all three phases ( melt , A crystals , and B crystals ) remaining constant and unchanged during the process . At any locality in the melt where an A crystal is precipitated the surrounding liquid is left supersaturated in B material and a B crystal precipitates next to the A. Such an intersection of liquidus curves is known as a eutectic point . The dissociation of the eutectic liquid of composition e into crystals of A and B is known as the eutectic reaction and may be written  | Since solidification is complete for all alloys at this temperature , a horizontal line fg is drawn at this level across the entire diagram . This line is called the solidus line , or the solidus .

It will show crystals of pure A which have come out in the earlier stages of freezing , prior to reaching the eutectic point , and grown to considerable size , so-called primary crystals of A , surrounded by alternate , smaller crystals ( since each has had less time to grow ) of A and B in a finely divided eutectic matrix or background ( shown diagrammatically second from the left in the bottom row of structures in Fig. 96 ) . The primary A crystals might resemble the pebbles in concrete . Both the large and the small A crystallites as well as  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Alloy 6 Si 20 % 1'iu 9S . The structures of aluminum-silicon alloys . ( Courtesy of the Research Laboratory Aluminum Company of America. )  | the small B crystallites will be pure in accordance with our assumption of complete insolubility in the solid state . A structure containing two crystalline varieties as this one does is called a " duplex " structure . Thus we see how a reading of the diagram of Fig. 95 enables one to predict the structure of any given alloy , both during its cooling and after it has reached room temperature . The appearance of these two alloys x and y at successive stages during the cooling of each is shown at the left and right sides of Fig. 96 . At the bottom of the diagram are shown the structures of several other alloys between pure A and B , when slowly cooled to room temperature . It will be noticed that the proportion of primary A crystallites increases from zero at the eutectic composition toward 100 per cent at the pure A ordinate , while that of primary B increases from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alloy of pure B. ' Now we may consider an actual alloy diagram . The simplified constitutional diagram of the alloys of aluminum and silicon is shown in Fig. 97 , neglecting the important but slight solubility of silicon in crystals of aluminum . Beginning at the left of the diagram with alloy 1 , as listed at the bottom of Fig. 97 , we have the microstructure2 of pure aluminum shown in Fig. 98a . Even the boundaries of the pure aluminum grains are scarcely discernible . Alloy 2 of Fig. 97 shows at 98b dendritic grains of aluminum surrounded by eutectic of small grains of aluminum and silicon . In Fig. 98c the eutectic increases and in d it occupies the entire field . In Fig. 98e primary silicon grains appear , set in the same aluminum-silicon eutectic and in f the proportion of primary silicon increases . From a diagram of this type , it is thus possible to predict the amount of primary crystals of silicon or aluminum , and the amount of the eutectic which the alloy will possess after solidification . It foretells the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystals during freezing , the composition of each phase , and the temperature of complete solidification ( in this case the eutectic temperature ) for every alloy of the series . To test the two rules given above ' The proportion of eutectic present is , of course , 100 per cent for an alloy e ; 0 per cent for pure A or pure B and inversely proportional as the distance between f and e , and between e and g , as given by the second rule . 2 For laboratory methods of polishing and etching metal specimens for examination of their structures see literature references at end of chapter .  | in this system aluminum-silicon , see Metallography Problem 1 , page 165 .

The eutectic reaction just described was based on Raoult 's condition of complete solubility in the liquid state , complete insolubility in the solid state . It occurs in a large number of important alloy systems , usually , however , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram of copper-nickel alloys. kinds of crystals which separates from the melt is not quite pure but contains a little of the other metal in solution as will be explained on page 143 . Equally important with the above case of assumed complete insolubility of two metals in the crystalline state is the opposite case , namely , that of complete solubility . For this case one would expect , at first thought , that the liquid , whatever its composition , would simply deposit crystals of the same composition as the liquid , and thus solidify as a pure metal does . While very special alloys do solidify in this . manner , they are relatively rare . Most of the completely soluble alloys deposit crystals  | which show a measured degree of difference in composition from that of the liquid in which they grow . A familiar example of a similar case is the distillation of a water-alcohol solution . The distillate is usually richer in alcohol than was the original liquid , although alcohol and water are completely soluble in all proportions in both the liquid and vapor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be either raised or lowered , in this case of complete solubility by the addition of foreign atoms , since it does not come within the scope of Raoult 's law . ' A typical diagram , that of copper-nickel , will appear as in Fig. 100 in which the freezing point of copper is raised , while that of nickel is lowered . In this case of complete solubility the freezing point of the alloys falls constantly as the proportion of copper in them increases . The upper line connecting the freezing points of pure copper and nickel is the liquidus curve at which crystallization begins in enclosed area is a two-phase field of one liquid and one crystalline phase . Solidification of a liquid alloy of this type consists of two processes : 1 . Formation and growth of crystals in the melt . 2 . Homogenization of the composition in various parts of each crystal : a . By diffusion between core and encasement. b . By diffusion between core and melt . If process 1 is more rapid than process 2 , as is usually the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between crystals and melt , and the solidification of the alloys will not follow the solidus line of the diagram exactly . Because this condition is important industrially , it will be described here . The Solidification of Completely Soluble Alloys. ? If a melt of composition C in Fig. 101 falls in temperature until it cuts the liquidus AB , it will precipitate crystals of composition D , shown in Fig. 102a according to Rule 1 above for the composition of each of two phases in a two-phase field . These crystals are richer in A than the melt , hence their separation leaves the melt richer in B. They are not , however , pure A , it will be noted ( see Fig. 101 ) . A further fall in temperature to E causes the For a discussion of the theory involved , see p. 141.  | melt to precipitate crystals of composition F encasing the D crystal cores and also forming separate F crystals as in Fig. 102b . If equilibrium is to be established at this temperature , complete diffusion between the I ) cores and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Effect of incomplete diffusion during freezing , on the position of the solidus line . ( Goerens. ) must be accomplished . Also some B atoms must diffuse clear into the A-rich center of the crystals so that the entire composition of the crystalline phase is thereby brought up to that of the point F on the diagram . Then the melt will move downward along the liquidus , and the crystals will move downward along ( a ) Dendrites of composition D in Fig. 101 ; ( b ) encasements of F and dendrites of F in Fig. 101. the solidus in both temperature and composition as the alloy cools . If , on the contrary , diffusion lags , the crystals at temperature E will not be of homogeneous composition F but will contain cores of D composition and encasements of F and will have an average composition as represented at F ' . At temperature II , the  | average composition of the crystalline phase is not II but II ' ; that is , the crystalline phase is constantly richer in A material than it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer in B material than it should be , as shown at I ' , and is still liquid . Further drop in temperature is needed therefore to complete solidification . Incomplete diffusion has had the effect , as shown on the cooling curves to the right of the diagram , of lowering the completion of freezing from temperature h down to temperature m . While the progress of solidification has been described above as if it took place in abrupt steps , actually , of course , it is a continuous process , each deposit grading gradually from the previous one . The Structures of These Alloys. ? The appearance of the microstructure of a copper-nickel alloy ( completely soluble , for constitutional diagram see Fig. 100 ) in this non-equilibrium condition is shown in Fig. 103a . The white dendrites or cores ( D in Fig. 102 ) are richer in nickel than the black encasements ( F in Fig. 102 ) which contain more copper . The reason for the abrupt boundary between white and black portions is that the etching acid attacks and blackens all nickel-copper alloys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrosion limit , " as explained in Chap . VIII ) and leaves the central cores , which are richer in nickel than this limit , unattacked . If the alloy in this condition is annealed for a long time just below the melting point , diffusion between the cores and encasements is completed and the microstructure of a homogeneous solid solution is obtained ( Fig. 103b ) . Since we can not see the individual atoms of nickel and copper in the crystal lattice , the grains appear like those of a pure metal . Industrially this homogeneous condition is achieved not by a very slow cooling rate during solidification ( which would result in very large grains , requiring a long time for diffusion from center to periphery to be completed ) but by chill casting to give a fine grain size , followed by either severe cold deformation and annealing , or by hot deformation , to accelerate equalization by diffusion . Figures 104c and 104d show the initial and an intermediate stage of diffusion in a cored cast steel . When rolled out into sheets and shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At room temperature the rate of diffusion in these " cored " crystallites is so slow that cast bronzes in the tombs of  | the kings in Egypt still show after 4,000 years this same nonuniformity . Many important industrial alloys including the stainless steels , the gold-copper alloys , the simple steels , and others are of this type as will be apparent in Fig. 215b , p. 285. ( d ) figure Quenching for the Solidus. ? The true solidus line of alloys of this kind is not determined by the very slow cooling of a melt but rather by reheating specimens of a completely homogenized alloy to certain progressively higher temperatures and quenching one specimen drastically from each temperature . Examination of ( a ) ( b ) figure  | each quenched specimen will show one certain specimen in which melting had just begun at the grain boundaries before it was quenched . The specimen quenched from a temperature 5 ? C. lower will show no such effects . The solidus for this alloy lies between the temperatures to which these two particular specimens were heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp of the diagram of completely soluble alloys , Problem 2 , page 166 , for the gold-platinum alloys should be solved at this point . Rationale of Change of Melting Point. ? The student may well ask how he is to understand the rise of melting point of a metal when a second metal is alloyed with it , since in the previous case , the simple eutectic , a lowering of the melting point always occurs . An explanation of the kind which follows makes this rise more rational and leads to a better understanding of the underlying cause of the rise . y First it will be necessary to prove that the vapor 1 c pressures of a crystalline phase and of its liquid are * ' / equal at the melting point . If this were not so it FIG. 105. - rof would be possible to construct a closed U-shaped e xu tityf oof glass tube as shown in Fig. 105 with crystals C on vapor Pres.-one side and liquid 1 on the other , and this tube , t if t ruarn seis a t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . motion ( Tammann ) , for the vapor pressures p and Tammann. pi over the crystalline and the liquid phases , respectively , would be different pressures . By opening or closing the valve b the pressure change would move the piston a and any amount of energy desired could be extracted from the system . Since experience has shown that a perpetual-motion machine is impossible to construct , obviously p , the vapor pressure above the crystalline phase , must be equal to pi , the vapor pressure over the liquid phase . With this fact of the equality of vapor pressures at the melting point in mind , let us see how the addition of foreign atoms ( a ) to the liquid and ( b ) to the crystals would affect the vapor pressures of the two phases and therefore the melting point . If the foreign ( solute ) atoms are soluble in the liquid phase but insoluble in the crystalline phase , it is clear ( 1 ) that the attraction of native  | for foreign atoms must be greater than that of native atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw off alone and not dissolve . ( 2 ) This greater attraction certainly means that at the surface of the liquid , where the vapor forms by the escape of atoms from the surface of the liquid , fewer native atoms would escape per second and therefore ( 3 ) the vapor pressure of the liquid phase would be lowered . This lowering is shown from Po to N in Fig. 106 . In this figure the curve AoBo gives the vapor pressure of the pure liquid and CoPo that of the pure solid . The point Po where the vapor pressures are equal Lowering of the vapor pressure of a liquid AoBo to AB and attendant lowering of the freezing point Po to N. ( After Miiller-Pouillet . ) Flo . 107 . Lowering of vapor pressure of a liquid phase PoBo to PB , and of a solid phase CoPo to CP upon the formation of a solution , and the consequent rise of melting point . must be the melting point . The curve AB shows how the vapor pressure of the liquid has been lowered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersection of AB with CoPo at N shows the melting point of the new solution . It has been lowered from To to T. This completes the case for the lowering of melting point covered by Raoult 's law . The vapor pressure of the solid phase CoPo has remained unchanged because the foreign atoms can not dissolve in it and therefore can not influence its vapor pressure . When the foreign atoms are dissolved in the crystalline phase also , it is clear that the vapor pressure of this phase will be lowered likewise . Depending on the relative degree of lowering in each phase , the melting point may either rise or fall . Thins , in Fig. 107 the temperature at which the vapor pressures are equal  | for the two alloyed phases is the point P which is a higher temperature than the point Po . The melting point has been raised . This reasoning and result hold also for changes in phase other than melting as , for example , in polymorphic phase changes . Partial Solid Solubility. ? The two extreme types of alloys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soluble ? have now been examined . It remains to examine the very important intermediate type which shows partial solubility in the solid state . This requires the introduction of no new principles for its elucidation . The lines f-F.P. , g-F.P. in the eutectic system of Fig. 95 are merely curved slightly and moved a little closer to their corresponding liquidus curves , and two two-phase fields , resembling in form the more dilute regions of the two-phase fields for the completely soluble alloys in Fig. 100 , are obtained . The appearance is as shown in Fig. 108 ( page 144 ) . The liquids in these alloys precipitate crystals which are never pure A or pure B but always contain a little of the other component in solid solution , similar to this extent to the completely soluble alloys . In fact near the points FP the diagram begins as if it would develop into the cigar-shaped diagram of a completely soluble alloy . At the eutectic temperature the liquidi intersect , and the liquid precipitates alternately not crystals of pure A and B , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of B in them , and crystals of B containing g per cent of A. The rules for calculating the quantity of phases f and g are used just as before , as is also the rule for determining the amount of the eutectic matrix after complete solidification . For example , alloy z ' in Fig. 108c at temperature fne would contain fn/fe ( X 100 per cent ) of liquid ( of composition e ) and ne/fe ( X 100 per cent ) of crystals ( of composition f ) . At temperatures above the eutectic temperature the alloys behave just like the complete soluble type of Fig. 101 , showing the cored structure if rapidly cooled . Below the temperature of the eutectic line feg , a familiar phenomenon takes place . As the temperature falls , there is a decrease of the solubility of B in crystals of A , and a decrease in the solubility of A in crystals of B. If we attach the lines fc and gd of Fig. 92 shown in Fig. 108b , to the points f and g of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this case the two phases belween lines fc and gd are two solid phases instead of  | two liquid phases as in the ether-water illustration of Fig. 92 . This complete diagram is thus composed of three familiar simple types : the eutectic reaction of Fig. 95 ; parts of the diagram of complete solubility of Fig. 101 ; and the ( now solid ) solubility curves fc and gd of Fig. 92 , and is easy to interpret in terms of these three simple cases . The Structures of Partially Soluble Alloys. ? The structure of alloy x of this series would be a cored structure on rapid cooling and a one-phase structure upon completion of diffusion ; a homogeneous , one-phase structure just like the completely soluble structures shown in Fig. 103b . Alloy z would show a similar homogeneous structure ( upon complete annealing ) except that since it falls in the two-phase field fcgd at room temperature , the homogeneous grains of Fig. 103b have become supersaturated with respect to B atoms at a tempera-figure ture below f and would precipitate alpha-solid solution ( dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beta crystallites ( light ) in the grain boundaries grains would thus contain a fine pre- and in the crystallographic eipitate of d crystals , appearing as planes of the host . a segregate at the grain boundaries and in the crystallographic planes of the host crystals of a-solid solution . The separation of this beta precipitate from the host , in this case alpha-solid-solution crystallites , takes place by a mechanism similar to the formation of a new polymorphic phase in a pure metal , or as recrystallization appears in a cold-worked metal explained in the preceding chapter . The final composition of the alpha crystals when they reach room temperature would be that of c . The structure is shown in Fig. 109 . This structure is called " Widmannstatten . " Steels show this type of decreasing solubility . For example , the sloping line at the right and left of the lower part of the field marked " y-solid solution " in Fig. 123 shows the decreasing solubility of gamma iron for alpha iron ( left ) and for carbon ( right ) as the temperature falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , of the diagram from 700 ? down to 300 ? C. shows the  | decreasing solutility of carbon in alpha iron as the temperature falls . Alloys z ' and y will contain a eutectic matrix of c and d crystals , the z ' alloy showing primary alpha crystallites of composition c ; the y alloy primary crystallites of composition d . These crystallites will not be homogeneous but , just as the alpha crystallites of the z alloy , will also have a fine precipitate of each other at their grain boundaries and within the crystallites themselves , due to the decreasing solubility of A in B as the temperature falls from g to d , etc . To test your grasp of diagrams for alloys of this type see Problem 3 , page 166 , for the alloys of copper and silver . The important age-hardening alloys such as duralumin also show this change of solubility with change in temperature as described on page 191 . If cooled rapidly from temperature f , as by quenching in water , an alloy such as z in Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form . On standing , however , the precipitation begins spontaneously and the alloy becomes very hard and strong . Rapid Cooling. ? Alloy z when cooled in complete equilibrium does not cross the eutectic line and the last liquid before solidification will not reach the point c ; therefore , no eutectic structure would be expected at the grain boundaries . If cooled rapidly , however , as discussed on page 137 , the crystalline phase becomes too rich in metal A ( due to lack of diffusion into the cores ) and , as a result , the liquid must become richer in B than the diagram shows , since the diagram holds for equilibrium conditions only . With fairly rapid cooling the diffusion ( listed at ( b ) on page 137 ) is practically zero , and the liquid phase reaches the point e of Fig. 108c . At this point it is saturated in B , and crystals of 3-solid solution will separate alternately with a . A eutectic is obtained in the z alloy . The same result may be obtained if the x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cause all of the eutectic to disappear by diffusion of B atoms into the A-rich cores of the primary a grains . Limiting Cases of Solubility. ? It is illuminating to see what would happen to these diagrams if they were distorted to represent extreme cases . For example , suppose in Fig. 108c that points f and g moved out toward the verticals at pure A and pure B , that is , suppose that a decrease in solid solubility of l3 in  | figure This is one of the particular , rare cases referred to at the beginning of the subject on page 136 , in which a completely soluble alloy deposits crystals of the same composition as the melt .  | It is analogous to a constant-boiling mixture of , say , alcohol and water . All the other alloys in this series behave as do those in Fig. 100 for copper-nickel . An alloy of this peculiar type occurs in the series iron-chromium , nickel-chromium , nickel-iron , copper-manganese , and copper-gold . For others see Fig. 215b , page 285 . Another limiting case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved closer and closer to the pure A ordinate . This case would appear as in Fig. 110 , in which the eutectic liquid is pure A , as described in the beginning of the eutectic discussion . Chemical Compounds and Their Solubilities. ? We may now assume that the basic principles of interpretation of binary F.P. F.P. FP A AXBy B figure diagrams are understood and that we are ready to advance to the last two cases to be considered . The simpler of these is the case where the combining of two kinds of atoms results not only in liquid or solid solution but in a chemical combination between the atoms to form a molecule , such as Fe3C in steel or CuAl2 in duralumin , or , in general terms , a compound , A , B , , . This combination is shown on the horizontal or composition line of the diagram at the composition of the new molecule ALBS , as in Fig. 112 . A vertical line should be erected also to show the freezing point or melting point of the compound , assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a pure metal , or a stable compound , for instance , would do . At once it is apparent that the diagram A-B can be divided into two parts , the one to show all alloys between A and ALB , , , the other to show those between ALB ? and B. Actually it is easiest to consider alloys of this class in this way , and quite eor-  | rect . When so considered , they are already understood from the types previously studied . For example , the separated diagram for A-AxB , might appear as in Fig. 113a , b and c . The compound AxB , is shown successively as having complete solubility for A , complete insolubility for A , and partial solubility for A , in the solid state , while the diagrams possible for alloys between A B , and B could appear in similar fashion . Combining the A AxBy ( a ) F.P. . Liquid+ Liquid Liquid+ =Liquid + ? Fp i crystals a crystalsA By FP crystalsA crystals AxBy ?

The microstructure of these alloys at room temperature can be predicted very simply ; for example , in Fig. 114a an alloy x would show primary crystals of pure A , surrounded by a eutectic matrix of alternate crystals of pure A and pure AxB , . Alloy x in Fig. 114b would show primary crystals of AxB. , surrounded by a eutectic of AxB , crystals and B crystals . Alloy x in Fig .

A similar case is that of the microstructure of hypereutectoid steels . This case , in which a chemical compound forms , is thus simple in that it merely divides the A-B diagram into two parts , and that the two diagrams so obtained are combined laterally . In each of the two parts of such a diagram there are only two components present and not more than two . For it is obvious that if the total composition of the alloy lies between AxB , and B , for example , there can not be any free A Liquid +crystals B Decomposition temperature of Ax ByCrystals Ax By+ crystals B A A , By B figure To test your grasp of diagrams of this type , try Problem 4 , page 166 , for the system , magnesium-lead . The Peritectic Reaction . The last case to be considered is that not altogether rare one in which a chemical compound or a solid solution can not withstand heating to its true melting point but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is surprising to note , results again in nothing really new but merely in an inversion of the eutectic reaction with which we are already acquainted . Upon heating an unstable alloy , let us say the compound A xBy , to its decomposition temperature , the AxBy crystals in Fig. 115 would yield a liquid 1 which is different in composition from A0B , . This liquation leaves crystals which are no longer AxBy , but perhaps they are pure B , as shown in Fig. 115 . A homogeneous phase of composition AxBy ( e in Fig. 116a ) upon heating ' Except as the compound AuB ? may be partly dissociated at any temperature . Liquid CrystarsS  | has here decomposed at a certain temperature into two other phases , external in composition to the original AxBy , a liquid 1 and crystals S. Diagrammatically the two reactions can be shown as in Fig. 116 below . The peritectic reaction is perhaps clearer in Fig. 117 . The separation of liquid from AxBy continues as long as heating continues until all AxBy has disappeared , the temperature remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vapor phase ) , just as it does in the eutectic reaction . The alloy now consists of liquid of composition 1 and crystals two phases ? //iquwd , /so/id 1 v Two phases bofh solid Fia . 116a. ? Peritectic reaction ; upon Flu . 116b . Eutectic reaction ; upon heating , one phase ( solid ) decomposes heating , two phases ( solid ) combine to into two others . ( Guertler. ) form one . ( Guertler. ) of composition S in Fig. 115 . Further heating causes a rise in temperature and the crystals s gradually dissolve or melt in the liquid , enriching the liquid in B as its temperature rises and causing the liquid to move upward and to the right along the liquidus . The condition is shown in Fig. 117 , as is also a complete diagram in Fig. 118 . The dotted curve of Fig. 118 shows , at its maximum , the temperature at which AxBy would melt if it did not decompose on heating . The case is sometimes called the " suppressed " or " hidden maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reverse process takes place . The original liquid alloy would precipitate pure B crystallites ( marked S in Figs. 115 and 118 ) until the reaction line is reached , the melt moving downward and to the left , along the liquidus toward 1 . Here the reverse of decomposition , that , is , combination must occur . The liquid , now of composition 1 , iewts  | with the pure primary S crystals swimming in the melt and forms ArBy crystals .

The peritectic reaction may be written cooling hiquid + crystals S crystals AxBy heating  | It is recalled that in the eutectic reaction a homogeneous phase ( liquid ) of composition e in Fig. 116b , upon cooling decomposes at a certain temperature into two crystalline phases external in composition to the original liquid . The present process is therefore just the reverse of the eutectic reaction . In the obstructed state the structure of the alloy is shown in Fig. 119 , showing the dark-gray peritectic enveloping wall and the unchanged black crystals inside it . If the total original composition lies not exactly on the line AxBy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cooling there will be left an excess either of liquid ( to left of AxBy ) or of S crystals ( to right of AxBy ) when the reaction is finished . If the original composition lies between AxB , and B , there will be kernels or cores of unchanged B left over when all of the liquid is used up and equilibrium is reached , these cores surrounded , of course , by AxB , walls . If the original composition lies between AxB , and A , say at y , there will be an excess of liquid and it will follow down the liquidus from 1 to the left depositing pure AxB , crystals figure //  | ( at these lower temperatures without necessity of reaction , since it is below the decomposition temperature of ArBy ) . Finally , the eutectic point is reached in these latter alloys , and the usual alternate deposition of small crystals of A and A , , B , ensues . The Liquid Composition . figure 121. ( a ) Eutectic reaction ; ( b ) peritectic reaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary crystallites of ALB , formed partly by reaction and partly by simple precipitation , in a eutectic of AcBy and A. This peritectic reaction , the reverse of the eutectic reaction , occurs in many important alloys such as copper-zinc , ironnitrogen , and in many others . A modification of it occurs when  | the reaction of liquid and crystals forms a solid solution instead of a chemical compound , as in the delta-gamma change of ironcarbon alloys . The results are entirely analogous . An example of a solid solution formed peritectically is shown in the region marked a in Fig. 120 . To test your grasp of this type of diagram , figure There are other ways of looking at this peritectic reaction to make it clear . For instance , the alloys containing both alpha and beta phases , in Fig. 1211 ) , if heated , form a liquid c which lies outside the composition of either crystalline phase al and b1 , rather than between them as in the case of the eutectic in Fig. 121a . Or one may say that the liquidus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum as in 121a , but midway between the freezing points of the pure components , as at c of Fig. 1211 ) .  | Limiting Cases of the Peritectic Reaction. ? Consideration of the limiting cases of the peritectic reaction will now make clear the conditions under which it occurs . For instance , if the compound AxB , did not decompose , it would melt at its true melting point as shown by the maximum of the dotted curve of Fig. 118 . If the pressure on the system is adjusted , it is sometimes possible actually to secure melting of the compound without decomposition . The addition of enough of a third element as in a ternary alloy also may render the compound stable up to and at its melting point . The transition from a peritectic to a eutectic condition , due to increased stability of the compound at high temperature , is shown in Figs. 122a , b , and c . The transition in Fig. 120 can be seen by moving point D to coincide with E. The resulting system is one of complete solubility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also under these conditions . Changes in Solidified Alloys . The very breadth and generality of these types of constitutional diagrams add to their importance . For example the two components might just as well be two inorganic salts as KC1 and NaCl , or NaCl and water , or iron and FeO , or copper and Cu2O . It is of the utmost value at this time to point out also that these principles hold equally well for changes in the solid state of metals and alloys , as well as for the liquid-solid transition . We need merely to substitute the words " solid solution " for the words " liquid solution " or " melt " in the above diagram for the eutectic and we have instead of the simple eutectic reaction the exact case of austenite ( solid solution ) decomposition in steel to form pearlite , called " eutectoid , " to distinguish it from the liquid reaction which we have studied . In this case , as shown in Fig. 123 , the freezing point of iron is replaced at the lower temperature by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case is exactly as simple as the familiar eutectic reaction . Figure 216 is a more complete diagram of the iron-carbon alloys for practical use . An even simpler example of the use of the diagrams to show changes in the solid state can be given by taking any one of the previously developed diagrams and simply drawing above it another diagram representing the liquid-solid transition . Thus Like that , of copper-nickel in Fig. 100.  | Fig. 124 shows an alloy series completely soluble at high temperatures but one in which both metals undergo polymorphous transformations at lower temperature and are only partly soluble at low temperatures in the crystalline state . An Example : Structural Changes in Steel when It Cools Slowly. ? Because of its great industrial importance and because it illustrates so many types of structural changes , an example in // Flo 123. - Iron- carbon diagram Fu ; . 124. - Diagram showing complete showing eutectoid decomposition of solubility at high temperatures , partial gamma-solid solution . solubility at lower temperatures . ( Ricer. ) the interpretation of constitutional diagrams will be given for the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that no new rules or special instructions , not given in the general case developed above , are necessary for this or any other binary diagram . A steel of 0.2 per cent carbon at 1600 ? C. is a homogeneous liquid as shown in Fig. 123 . When its temperature has dropped to about 1520 ? C. ( cuts the liquidus ) , impure crystals of delta iron ( body-centered cubic ) containing some carbon will precipitate , the melt thus becoming richer in carbon and following down the liquidus and to the right . At the temperature of the horizontal line at 1500 ? the melt and delta crystals react peritectically to form gamma-iron crystals ( face-centered cubic ) . Since the origi-  | nal composition of the steel lies to the left of the peritectie composition , there will be an excess of delta crystals after the liquid is exhausted . With further drop in temperature these delta crystals transform to gamma , without interaction of the melt . Slightly above 1400 ? the structure is entirely gamma-iron solid solution ( austenite ) , probably with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From this temperature down to the A3 line , there is no phase change in the alloy . There may be grain growth or diffusion , or there may be completion of delayed changes , but if equilibrium has existed during cooling there will be no phase change in this field . When cooling has brought the gamma-iron solid solution down to the temperature of the A3 line , it has now become saturated with respect to alpha iron and precipitates alpha iron at the grain boundaries and in the crystallographic planes of the host gammasolid solution ( see Fig. 109 ) . The alpha crystallites precipitated are practically pure iron , since carbon is insoluble ( actually about 0.03 per cent is soluble at this temperature ) in alpha iron . Removal of iron leaves the composition of the austenite grains more concentrated in carbon , and it moves downward and to the right to the eutectoid point . Once arrived here , it is now saturated likewise in Fe3C and precipitates alternately alpha iron ( ferrite ) and Fe3C ( cementite ) until all austenite has disappeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearlite . " It appears solid black in Fig. 125b , but if magnified to 2,800 diameters the black areas show their fine , alternate lamellae of ferrite ( white ) and cementite ( black ) ( Fig. 125e ) . Owing to the rate of cooling little or no intracrystalline ferrite as in Fig. 109 is present here . This structure remains unchanged down to room temperature , except that the ferrite precipitates a tiny amount of carbon . In the slowly cooled condition the structure of iron-carbon alloys and that of alpha-beta brass often appear quite similar , as shown in Figs. 126a and 126b . The precipitating phase has appeared both at the grain boundaries and in the crystallographic planes of the host crystal . This structure is called " Widmannstatten " for its discoverer . The black background of Fig. 126a is pearlite , unresolved . Structural Changes in Steel When It Is Heated. ?

( Hanemann. ) islands of austenite growing in the pearlite as heating proceeds . In this condition the alpha iron is , of course , magnetic ( see Chap . II ) while the iron in the austenite has changed to the gamma form , dissolved the Fe3C lying next to it , and is non-magnetic . The amount of austenite and of ferrite can , of course , be calculated at this temperature by the use of Rules 1 and 2 . Further heating to the A2 line causes the remaining alpha iron to lose all of its magnetism too . During this heating from temperature Al upward , the free ferrite at the grain boundaries and in the crystal planes is gradually dissolving in the host austenite , causing the composition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A3 line . When the temperature of the steel crosses this line all free ferrite has gone into solution and nothing remains except grains of gamma-iron solid solution , called austenite ( see  | Fig. 216 ) . If heating is continued to a still higher temperature the size of these austenite grains grows coarse . Hence in heat treating to get a fine grain size , steels are usually quenched only slightly above the temperature necessary to produce homogeneous austenite ( called A3 temperature ) . If the quenching is rapid ( b ) Fxa. 127. - (a) A 0.15 % carbon steel heated just below Ai and quenched. ( b ) Same , heated just above Ai and quenched . Arrows show austenite islands ( quenched to martensite ) forming in pearlite . ( Courtesy of Dr. M. A. Grossmann. ) very little free ferrite has time to collect at the grain boundaries and in the planes but remains finely dispersed throughout each grain , as explained later under Quenching , page 182 . Steels which do not coarsen rapidly in the gamma range are called fine-grained steels ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse of that on cooling .  | The hypereutectoid ( above 0.90 per cent C ) steels and the cast irons will respond to similar analysis and application of the Rules 1 and 2 given on page 126 .

From A. BUTTS , " A Textbook of Metallurgy Problems . " GIBBS ' PHASE RULE ' Nomenclature. ? A brief examination of this important scientific generalization is essential to the treatment of any subject whose foundation is the phase rule . It has not been given at the beginning of Part II because it was felt wiser to stress the uses of constitutional diagrams rather than their derivation . ' See also RIVETT , A. C. D. , " The Phase Rule , " Oxford University Press , New York , 1923.  | Gibbs ' phase rule predicts the number of phases P which may be present in a system of C components under a given set of conditions of temperature , pressure , and volume . Thus , for example , a binary ( C = 2 ) alloy may in a particular case exhibit three ( P = 3 ) kinds of crystals even when annealed for a long time ( temp . = variable ) . The doubt whether a longer annealing can avail in removing one of the kinds of crystals by diffusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the system , as we shall see below . The practical importance of the rule is thus illustrated in the annealing operation . The Term " Phase . " ? In the terms of Willard Gibbs , ' a phase is a portion of matter , homogeneous in the sense that its smallest mechanically isolable parts are indistinguishable from one another . We may call such bodies as differ in composition or state , different phases of the matter considered , regarding all bodies which differ only in quantity and form as different examples of the same phase . Homogeneity in the sense intended is a term applicable to a mixture of gases or to a solution of one substance in another . Thus , there can be only one vapor phase ( all gases being completely miscible ) but several liquid and crystalline phases . The Term " Variable . " Since a particular phase may be able to exist under various conditions of temperature , pressure , and specific volume , it is usual and convenient to refer to these factors as the variables of the phase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecular species in terms of which the compositions of all phases in that system may be quantitatively expressed ( Nernst ) . Thus , in the system copper-aluminum which contains the compounds CuAI and CuAl2 , all compositions may be expressed by the molecular species Cu and Al . Therefore , it is a twocomponent system . Derivation ( Non-mathematical ) . Suppose that P phases exist in equilibrium with one another , and that their compositions may all be expressed in terms of C components . For each phase there will be an equation connecting its variables : pressure , temperature , and volume ( or its reciprocal , concentration ) ; for example , f ( p , t , v ) = 0 . For a system of P phases there will be P single-phase equations of this type . Also the P phases may ' " Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs , " Trans . Connecticut Academy , 1874-1878.  | be arranged in P ? 1 pairs , ' so that there will be P ? 1 phaseequilibrium equations for each component or in all C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equations is P + C ( P ? 1 ) . The variables will be pressure , temperature and the concentration of each component in each phase ; altogether C X P concentrations . The total number of variables is thus 2 + CP ( the figure is 2 instead of 3 because , if pressure and temperature be fixed , then the volume is fixed also ) . The number of variables minus the number of equations connecting the variables must be the number of degrees of freedom of the system , represented by F. Thus , if the number of equations is equal to the number of variables , the system will have no degree of freedom but will be completely specified . In general terms F = ( 2+CP ) ? P+C ( P ? 1 ) = 2 ? P+C . This simple relation , first worked out from thermodynamic considerations by Prof. J. Willard Gibbs at Yale University , is called the " phase rule . " Examples . For a one-component system , the equilibrium conditions have been shown on page 13 . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 95 , page 130 , we may apply the phase rule as follows : I. In the region above the liquidus we have : Number of components ( A and B ) = 2 Number of phases ( liquid and vapor ) = 2 Applying the rule , F = C + 2 ? P =2+2 ? 2 = 2 degrees of freedom That is to say , we may change the temperature and the concentration of the liquid phase without destroying the equilibrium , that is , without introducing a new phase or exterminating either of the two phases present . II . In the field between the liquidus and the solidus we have : Number of components = ( A and B ) = 2 Number of phases ( liquid , crystals A or B , vapor ) = 3 F=2+2 ? 3 = 1 degree of freedom In a three-phase system , if phases I and II are in equilibrium , and phases I and III are , then II and III must be so , hence P ? 1 equations ? for each component , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this region , if the temperature is changed , the concentration of each phase must change with it , as shown by the slope of the liquidus and solidus curves . III . At the eutectic temperature e we have : Number of components ( A and B ) = 2 Number of phases ( vapor , liquid , crystals A and crystals B ) = 4 F=2+2 ? 4 = 0 degree of freedom At this temperature a change of either temperature or pressure will cause a phase to disappear . If the temperature is lowered , the liquid disappears . If it is raised , either A or B crystals or both disappear . Thus , in a two-component system ( a binary alloy ) , four phases can be present only at a definite and fixed temperature . During the solidification of a eutectic or peritectic alloy , the temperature of the system and the composition of the four phases must remain constant , as indicated by the straight horizontal line drawn at that point in the diagram . Clearly , if any binary alloy shows three solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the treatment has not been complete . An unintentional third component such as an undetected impurity must , of course , be guarded against in these conclusions , as such an impurity really supplies an additional component to the system . It thus becomes apparent that the equilibrium diagrams in this chapter are all expressions of the phase rule . This derivation of the diagrams has not been stressed previously because such derivation often becomes a substitute for practice in the use of these diagrams in handling metallic problems , and , for the metallurgist , it is in the use of these diagrams that their greatest value lies , not in a study of the principles which they illustrate .

For , although the microscope tells us when a new phase , such as an intermetallic compound has appeared , or when solubility has been exceeded , it tells us nothing about changes which may occur in the crystals when a new phase does not appear , that is , for example , when the two  | components form a solid solution of variable composition . In Chap . I the crystal structure of pure metals ( pure A or B ) has been examined . It seemed best to study also equilibrium in solid solutions as is done in Chap . IV before taking up the crystal structure of alloys as will be done now . Substitutional Solid Solutions . In solid-solution crystallites we have , in many cases , instead of a lattice made up of one kind of atoms only as in the pure metals , a simple substitution of the foreign atoms for native atoms at corresponding points in the lattice of the pure metal , called the " host lattice , " as illustrated in Fig. 132. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal lattice changes linearly with the proportion of foreign atoms introduced . ' The X-ray diffraction patterns of the alloys must change in conformity to the change of lattice parameter of the solid solutions . ' The diagram of lattice dimensions for the quenched copper-gold alloys ( Vegard and Dale ) is given in Fig. 133 . The actual spectrograms for the series aluminum-magnesium are shown in Fig. 134 . Sometimes a series of binary alloys which appear to be completely soluble under the microscope do , nevertheless , show changes in the lattice form , rather than a simple expansion of the host lattice when examined by X-ray diffraction . Thus McKee ' In some few cases a slight contraction giving a lattice smaller than the average of the two atom diameters is obtained . The amount of contraction is not more than 0.5 per cent . 2 NErtsURGER , " Roentgenographie der Metalle and ihrer Legierungen , " p. 79 , F.

The distribution of foreign atoms in the lattice of a substitutional solid solution usually is random . In the rarer case of uniform distribution , the periodic placement of the foreign atoms may give rise to its own set of X-ray interference lines . This larger periodic structure or superlattice was named by the Germans " Ueberstruktur . " It is found in many instances  | at concentrations corresponding to multiple proportions of the two kinds of atoms and has , therefore , been called a " molecular lattice . " Of particular interest are the alloys CuAu and Cu3Au in the system Cu-Au shown in Fig. 135 . At elevated temperatures they are solid solutions ( random distribution of atoms ) and at lower temperatures show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to definite intermetallic compounds , such as CuAu or Cu3Au , with the interference lines of a molecular lattice . The intensity of reflection from an atom , that is , its efficiency as a scatterer of X-rays , is proportional to its atomic number , making it possible to identify the heavier atoms in the case of a superlattice by this means . The 0 and 0 ' solid solutions in the brasses , Fig. 228 , Chap . XII , are another example of the same kind . The /3 ' solution shows a superlattice ; /3 does not . Interstitial Solid Solutions. -A second type of solid solution is one in which the foreign atoms do not substitute for the host atoms but exist in the spaces between the lattice planes of the host crystal . Naturally this " interstitial " type of solid solution leads to a higher density than does the substitutional arrangement of atoms . The solid solutions of carbon , nitrogen , and hydrogen in gamma iron are of this type .

' The movement of atoms along the grooves between the planes of the host lattice is more rapid than is the hand-over-hand movement of the diffusion in a substitutional type of lattice . Hanemann has called the interstitial type " perfusion . " The Crystal Structure of Compounds. ? For intermetallic compounds the lattice form is usually more complicated than for pure metals or for solid solutions , and more resemblant to the lattice forms of inorganic compounds . This lower order of crystal symmetry and fewer planes of dense atomic population of these compounds may be associated with their great hardness , that is , greater resistance to slip .

The Determination of Solubility Limits by X-rays . In certain instances either the X-ray or the microscopic method can be used in the investigation of alloy constitution . In other instances only one or the other is applicable . The lattice structure of solid solutions requires , of course , X-ray analysis , atomic structure being far too fine for visibility , even with the most powerful microscope . The extent of solid solubility , on the contrary , may be investigated by either method . An example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . For the solubility of magnesium in aluminum the X-ray spectrograms for alloys with increasing content of magnesium are shown ' in Fig. 134 . The expansion of the aluminum lattice by the increasing concentration of the larger magnesium atoms is indicated by the increasing radii of the circles , arcs of which are shown on either side of the central spot on the strips of film . If the expansion of the aluminum lattice is measured for each atomic percentage of magnesium in it the result may be shown as in Fig. 136 . In determining these changes in parameter , the various alloys containing from 0 to 24.05 per cent magnesium , shown by crosses in Fig. 136 , were sealed in glass tubes and heated in boiling sulphur ( 445 ? C. ) for 1% days , to get a statistically uniform distribution of magnesium atoms throughout the aluminum lattice , then quenched in water , thus preserving in I SCHMID and SIEBEL , Z. Metallkunde , July , 1931 , p. 202.  | solution all of the magnesium present in each alloy , up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent and more of magnesium all showed the same parameter , indicating that no more magnesium could be dissolved in aluminum at 445 ? . Those containing lower percentages of magnesium , as 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , etc. , per cent , showed a parameter proportional to the amount of magnesium present . They were unsaturated at 445 ? C. The expansion of the original aluminum lattice for each percentage of magnesium was then measured in each quenched alloy figure figure and is shown in Fig. 136 . The aluminum lattice expands practically linearly with increase in magnesium content at the rate of 0.0047 A. per atomic per cent of dissolved magnesium up to a limit of about 16.8 atomic per cent Mg ( 15.3 weight per cent ) 1 at 445 ? C. as shown in Fig. 136 . This part of the investigation could not , of course , have been done microscopically . Once the relation is known between lattice parameter and concentration of the solid solution , it is easy to determine the solid-solubility line . It is only necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnesium at various temperatures up to the eutectic temperature , quench it from each temperature , and determine the lattice parameter for the solid For the calculation of atomic per cent see footnote , p. 204.  | solution existing at that temperature ( in the first step all alloys were heated to the same temperature 445 ? C. ) . The corresponding solubilities can be read from the figure above . The partial diagram of the system Al-Mg is shown in Fig. 137 . The older method for determining this curve was used by Dix and Keller ' for these alloys . In the microscopic method ( described on page 140 ) each alloy is quenched from a series of temperatures . If the microstructure , of a particular alloy shows two phases when quenched from a certain temperature the solubility at that temperature has been exceeded . If one phase only is found , it is quenched next time from a slightly lower temperature . Finally , a precipitate very small in amount is just visible at high magnification . The solubility limit lies between the last two temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig. 137 that the results obtained by the two different methods were in good agreement . Thus the X-ray is quite useful for investigation of unsaturated solid-solution alloys where there is a consistent and measurable change in lattice parameter . Although it has not led to a solution of the age-hardening problem , it has been of value in studying alloys of the type such as duralumin . Its use may be expected to increase steadily , although always within certain boundaries .  | NON-EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS IN BINARY ALLOYS . QUENCHING , AGING Unstable Conditions in Alloy Structures . In Chap . IV a system was developed for predicting the microstructure of any binary alloy when it is in equilibrium at any given temperature . Before turning our attention to non-equilibrium conditions in binary alloys , it seemed advisable to examine the crystal structure of binary alloys , as was done in Chap . V , so that the nature of non-equilibrium conditions could now be more fully understood . In all the changes through which an alloy passes in cooling changes in solubility where precipitation or absorption of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two phases unite into one ( peritectic ) or one phase decomposes into two others ( eutectic ) ? the changes are accomplished by the movement of atoms from one position to another . For example , the atoms diffuse past each other to equalize the concentration differences in cored crystallites ; they segregate out of a supersaturated solid solution to form separate crystallites as in a eutectoid reaction , they diffuse through a peritectic wall . Not only must the atoms be mobile , but they must have sufficient time for migration if the change is to be completed . All of these processes will be retarded or even entirely suspended if the mobility of the atoms is suddenly and substantially decreased , or if the time for their migration is cut short . Therefore if an alloy , as for instance one of the type indicated in Fig. 92 , were quenched suddenly from a temperature above t3 where complete solution exists , it is possible that none of the atoms will have time to separate from each other and form two separate phases before the temperature has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atom mobility may be so sluggish that the change is completely suspended and a supersaturated solution obtained at the lower temperature . The familiar examples of supercooling are those of water supercooled below 0 ? C. , 1s1  | and glass , which remains a viscous liquid at room temperature . By this retarding means , called " quenching " in metallurgy , alloy z in Fig. 108c , if quenched rapidly enough at the temperature of the point f , would show a homogeneous structure of alpha-solid solution when it reached room temperature , there having been insufficient time allowed at the temperatures between f and room temperature for it to decompose . By this means , too , the austenite ( solid solution of carbon in gamma iron ) of Fig. 123 could be retained , ( at least partially ) , at room temperature ; or , again , the peritectic formation of ABy in Fig. 118 could be limited to a very thin wall of AFB ? compound around the B crystallites , thus leaving an excess of liquid outside the wall to go down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions existing in the alloy at a higher temperature may be retained , completely or partially , by suddenly bringing the alloy to a lower temperature . This state of suspended equilibrium is responsible for the remarkable properties of heat-treated steels and of many other heat-treated alloys . Quenched Solid Solutions. ? Of these suspended changes most important is probably the particular case where a solid solution is brought from a high to a low temperature so rapidly that the natural precipitation of dissolved material which should accompany fall in temperature can not take place fully . Certain alloy steels notably 14 per cent manganese lying in the solid-solution field of Fig. 123 , if quenched rapidly , will remain homogeneous solid solutions at room temperature , as shown in Fig. 138 . The dissolved atoms of carbon have had insufficient opportunity for precipitation from the solid-solution lattice , and at room temperature they are relatively immobile . Supercooling may result also when the rate of cooling is quite slow , due to a low rate of nucleus formation or a low rate of crystal growth , in the phase which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary aluminum crystals may fail to appear until quite a quantity of silicon has precipitated . Then , finally , the aluminum crystals start to form and continue to grow until the liquid is brought back to the proper eutectic concentration . Such an alloy will show a structure of " primary " silicon crystals , " primary " aluminum crystals , and a eutectic between and around them .  | Rapid cooling of the copper-zinc alloys between 40 and 45 per cent zinc , from 800 ? C. or above yields a solid solution called " beta brass , " as shown in Fig. 139 . The diagram of these alloys is shown in Fig. 228 . In this case the alpha crystallites , rich in copper , have had insufficient opportunity to precipitate out of the beta solid-solution lattice . At room temperature their motion is too sluggish for precipitation to take place . When precipitation is allowed to take place , the structure is that in Fig. 126b . Aluminum-copper alloys and many others yield similar homogeneous solid solutions if quenched rapidly from a high temperature . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought into a region where it is unstable , for example , when austenite is cooled below 730 ? C. , the rate at which it will decompose is proportional to two temperature effects . One is the influence 4 T of absolute temperature on all chemical reactions , tending to make them take place more slowly at lower temperatures . The other is the increasing tendency for the reaction to take place the farther the phase in question is withdrawn from the limits of its region of stability ; ' ( T , ? T ) . The interaction of these two temperature effects gives the experimentally observed time for the reaction to take place at any given temperature . figure  | Rates of transformation of 0.78 per cent carbon steel at various ( constant ) subcritical temperatures ( the thin wedges in the pearlite and troostite circles-hypoeutectoid ferrite ) . ( Courtesy of United States Steel Corporation Research Laboratory. )  | Davenport and Bain , ' in a classical investigation , have determined the rates of transformation of austenite at various temperatures below its region of stability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart 730 ? C. is the lowest temperature at which austenite is stable . A group of very small specimens of eutectoid steel was quenched from above 730 into a lead bath held at a chosen constant temperature . The specimens were held in the bath for various intervals of time . At the end of each interval one specimen of the group was withdrawn from the bath , quenched in iced brine , and examined under the microscope to see the extent of decomposition of the austenite which had taken place in the specimen during its sojourn in the lead bath . ( The slight degree of reaction which occurred during the brine quench could always be differentiated from that which had taken place in the lead bath at a higher temperature . ) Thus the rate of decomposition of austenite at a chosen temperature was measured ; that is , the rate of attainment of equilibrium in the austenite at that temperature was determined . For example , Fig. 141 shows the progress of austenite decomposition into pearlite at 1300 ? F. at intervals of 500 sec. , 1300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature region of austenitestability .

A similar group of specimens was held at each of a number of lead-bath temperatures until the rates of decomposition at all 1325 ? F. for 7200 sec . RC = 7 1200 ? F. for 10 sec. 1100 ?

RC = 15 RC = 22  | rium in a supercooled phase , when quenched to , and held at , various temperatures . Similar results have been found by C. S. Smith for the copper-aluminum alloys . ' Theoretical Aspects. ? The rate of reaction is given in physical chemistry texts as log 1 ? = ? TT where R is the reaction rate , A , B , and C are constants , and T is the absolute temperature . Professor G. B. Upton has pointed The rise in temperature necessary to double the reaction rate . out that plotting the temperature rise , which will cause a doubling of reaction rate as ordinates , against the absolute temperature as abscissas gives a consistent result as is shown in Fig. 143 . On this graph , the familiar fact that the rate of a chemical reaction at room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated ; as is also the fact that at about 500 ? C. AT to double the rate of recrystallization of cold-worked steel is 25 ? C. , etc . All of these relationships lie on or near to a straight line whose slope is about 20 . Such a line is obtained if the logarithm of the reaction rate be plotted against the logarithm of the absolute temperature at which the reaction takes place . If the above given equation be differentiated with respect to temperature , remembering that loge 2 = 0.693 , one gets the Trans . A. I. M. E. , Inst. of Metals Div. , 1933 . Teo  | increment of temperature to double the reaction rate = AT = 0.693T2/A + CT2 . At low temperatures , this gives OT varying as T2 , for CT2 is negligible ; but at high temperatures the expression approaches 0.693/C , a constant . When plotted , this equation yields the curve shown in broken line in Fig. 143 . Upton concludes that the T20 line , since it predicts the experimental results from 300 ? to 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1050 ? probably holds also at other temperatures . Using the best data available Upton has since calculated the constants A and C. The equation thus stands : log R = -7 TO + 0.0020T where T is the absolute temperature , A = 7600 , C = 0.0020 . Plotting this equation gives the lowest ( thin ) line on Fig. 143 . Since reaction rates in the solid state , such as the decomposition of austenite , require atoms to move from " here " to " there " in order to form new crystals , hence , basically , reaction velocities must depend on the rates of diffusion at the reaction temperature . The Quenching of Steel. ? It will be noted in Fig. 140 that the decomposition of austenite proceeds with maximum rapidity between 600 ? and 500 ? C. , at which temperature only a few seconds are needed to permit austenite to transform to pearlite ( soft ) . If the austenite is cooled through this region rapidly enough and down to about 150 ? C. or below , as in commercial hardening of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very hard state . ' The lag and transformation time just under the equilibrium line Al are long . They decrease to a very short time between 600 ? and 500 ? C. , then increase rapidly and are quite long down to 100 ? C. where they again are short . This reminds one at once of the rate of nucleus formation in crystallization from the liquid state and is probably of a similar nature ( shown in Fig. 25 , page 34 ) , that is to say , the rate of nucleus formation is low near the transition point ( time of transformation is long ) , it increases to a maximum , and then sinks but rises again at 150 ? C. The rate of transformation of a grain of austenite is quite high once it has started , but as soon as about one-third of the grain ' BAIN , E. C. , Trans . A. S. S. T. , November , 1932.  | has transformed the rate drops greatly . For this reason much unchanged austenite is often found in a quenched bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decomposition of austenite at various subcritical temperatures usually differ from those obtained when the austenite is quenched drastically to room temperature and then reheated or " tempered . " The structure and properties depend on the temperature or sequence of temperatures at which the decomposition takes place . Influence of rate of cooling on the temperature of the transformations in steel . ( Wever and Engel . ) Similar but less complete results were obtained by Wever and Engel ' as shown in Fig. 144 . If the cooling rate of a 0.043 per cent carbon steel is 800 ? per second or slower , then the precipitation of alpha iron from the gamma-iron solid solution ( austenite ) A3 , the return of magnetism A2 , and the formation of pearlite Al all may be distinguished from each other as shown by the three separate curves A3 , A2 , and A 1 at the upper part of Fig. 144 . It will be noted also that , as the rate of quenching increases , each of these three changes takes place at a lower temperature . Not until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the A3 and A2 transformations coincide . If the cooling rate is greater than 2500 ? per second , footnote  | the A3 , A2 , and Al transformations are entirely suppressed and instead the formation of martensite at the line M takes place . The temperature of M is independent of the rate of cooling , so long as it is above 2500 ? per second . For a 0.54 carbon steel the temperatures of the three transformations A3 , A2 , and Al coincide even for very slow rates of cooling , and martensite formation is obtained if the rate is 500 ? per second or greater . The higher the carbon content , the lower the temperature of martensite formation . At 1.7 per cent carbon it is 100 ? . For a given carbon content , the temperature of martensite formation is independent of the rate of quenching . The Products of Austenite . It should be emphasized here that not only is the rate of decomposition of austenite different at different temperatures , but the product into which it decomposes depends also on the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 725 ? C. down to about 500 ? C. the product formed is lamellar pearlite. 145. - Troostite in martensite formed by direct decomposition of The lamellae are finer , the lower austenite . ( Courtesy of United States the temperature at which they Steel Corporation Research Laboratory. ) form . Inability to see the finer lamellae microscopically has in the past led to calling it " troostite . " Now that the lamellae can be seen plainly , Bain and Davenport prefer to call it " nodular fine pearlite , " which seems fully justified . The term " troostite " they reserve for structures in the lower part of this region which can not as yet be resolved with the microscope . These structures are shown in Fig. 142 and are indicated in Fig. 140 . When the austenite decomposes at temperatures below 150 ? C. , it forms martensite , an unstable phase of tetragonal bodycentered iron structure , possessing great hardness . The microstructure is shown at the white areas in Fig. 145.  | In order to obtain martensite , it is necessary to cool the austenite past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? C. ) , before this decomposition has time to begin ( time lag ) and thus to bring it unaltered into the temperature region where martensite forms . If the rate of cooling is very slow , the specimen will tarry long enough in the temperature range of rapid pearlite formation for the pearlite reaction to be completed . The final structure will be pearlitic . If the cooling is slightly faster , a part of the austenite may escape the pearlite change and reach the temperature of martensite formation where this part decomposes into martensite . A mixed structure will result . A very fast cooling rate will bring the austenite past all of the temperatures at which pearlite forms , without letting it tarry long enough to start pearlite formation . The austenite will decompose at a temperature below 150 ? C. into martensite . The structure will be martensitic . Other solid solutions such as the beta phase of copper-aluminum , copper-beryllium , and copper-tin decompose in a similar manner , yielding different products when the decomposition takes place at different temperatures . The rates of decomposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of iron-carbon shown above . It is to illustrate the principles which underlie the decomposition of a supercooled solid solutions : the rate of attainment of equilibrium , and the products formed at different temperatures , that the case of austenite has been quoted so fully here . It is important that the reader shall realize that the principles apply also to many other cases . Age Hardening of Quenched Alloys . ' In many cases a solid solution may by quenching be brought to room temperature without undergoing any decomposition en route . The rates of decomposition of such solutions in the temperature interval of quenching are slower than that of 0.78 per cent C austenite . The alloys of aluminum with copper up to 5 per cent may be used as illustration . Figure 238 shows the constitutional diagram of these alloys with the important region enlarged . When quenched in  | water , after complete solution has been achieved by holding at 530 ? C. , the 5 per cent Cu alloy is a homogeneous solid solution of Brinell hardness about 55 kg. per square millimeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) This heating and quenching is called the " solution heat treatment . " At room temperature , after an induction period of several hours , the alloy gradually increases in hardness , at first rapidly , then more slowly , as shown in Fig. 146 . Figure 146 shows at the extreme left the properties of hard-rolled duralumin sheet , then the softening following The aging of duralumin , and the changes in properties accompanying it . ( Budgen. ) 100 6 heating and quenching , and then the progressive hardening of the alloy upon standing at room temperature . Notice that the elastic limit rises from less than 7 to more than 13 . The formability of the alloys decreases as the hardness and strength rise . The forming of the metal , such as bending , stamping , and riveting , is done , therefore , immediately after quenching and before hardening sets in . Aging , that is , the decomposition of this supersaturated solid solution , takes place more rapidly at 150 ? C. The rate of attainment of equilibrium is faster at this temperature than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definite temperature after quenching is called the " precipitation heat treatment . " If silicon is added to the alloy ,  | it raises the hardness , as quenched , only slightly and does not interfere with the aging process . Iron , on the contrary , interferes with aging , and , if 1 per cent iron is present , it inhibits aging . Theoretical Aspects. ? Merica , Waltenberg , and Scott ' offered an explanation of age hardening which greatly clarified the popular understanding of the phenomenon . They supposed that upon aging , a fine precipitate formed in the potential slip planes of the host metal , that is , in the supersaturated solid-solution crystals . This precipitate if too fine , as it would be when first formed , would offer very little additional resistance to slip when the crystals are stressed . The metal would not at once increase in hardness . Gradually the precipitated particles would coalesce , however , until they became effective as " keys " in locking together neighboring parts of the crystal and in blocking slip along the crystallographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which caused the maximum hardness in the metal was called the " critical dispersion " of the particles . Further aging caused continued coalescence of these particles and resulted in relatively few particles of larger size , their number and disposition being insufficient to cause great hardness . The alloy was said to be " overaged . " Consideration of the rules for hardness , specific volume , electrical conductivity , and lattice parameter of solid solutions as developed in Chap . VIII will make it clear that upon precipitation of a phase from solution the concentration of the solution will be lowered . Hence , the hardness should decrease , the electrical conductivity should increase , the density should decrease ( for substitutional solutions ) and the lattice dimensions should change . Actually , however , during aging , the electrical conductivity changes scarcely at all , and in low-temperature aging it actually decreases . The microscope shows no precipitation of CuAl2 or any other substance in the aluminum crystals . In fact , it shows practically no change in the microstructure . The X-ray pattern likewise shows no change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of a precipitated phase . One would expect an expansion of volume if a new phase were being precipitated but actually there is a slight but definite contraction noticeable in the dilatometer as hardening goes on . Other age-  | hardenable alloys such as Cu-Ag seem to show a visible precipitate at the time when their hardness reaches a maximum . Thus , doubt is thrown upon the accuracy but not upon the usefulness of the interpretation given by Merica . Fraenkel proposes that it is the congregation of solute ( Cu ) atoms at points in the ( aluminum ) solvent lattice just prior to precipitation which causes the distortion of slip planes and the hardening observed . Merica terms these congregations " knots . " In general , alloys which at a high temperature are homogeneous solid solutions , but which decrease in solubility with fall in temperature , are susceptible to age hardening . The important feature of the diagram is thus the slope of the solid-solubility lines fc and gd as shown in Fig. 95 . Other Instances of Unstable Alloy Structures. ? Particular attention has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid solution by quenching and to its rate of decomposition at various temperatures . Other cases of suspended equilibrium , such as the cored structure met when diffusion is inhibited in completely soluble alloys by rapid cooling , and the obstruction of the peritectic wall to diffusion from liquid to primary crystals , are also examples of the metastable states resulting from suddenly lowered atom mobility . These cases have been treated in detail in other parts of this text when dealing with types of alloys in which they occur .  | THE STRUCTURE OF TERNARY ALLOYS AT EQUILIBRIUM Further improvement in the qualities of a binary alloy may frequently be gained by the addition of a third element . Nickel in steel ( iron-carbon ) improves its toughness , lead in brass ( cop-A a figure per-zinc ) improves its machinability , magnesium in aluminumsilicon alloys or in nickel containing sulphur , babbitt metal , etc. , are familiar examples . Fortunately , the phase rule and the rules for interpreting equilibrium diagrams developed in Chap . IV apply as well here as in the simpler binary alloys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they apply and to illustrate their method of application . 195  | Representation of Ternary Compositions. ? If the pure components ( pure metals , pure compounds , or pure non-metallic elements ) are represented at the corners of an equilateral triangle ABC as shown in Fig. 147 , then the sides of the triangle represent the bases of binary systems A-B , A-C , and B-C , such as have been studied in Chap . IV . A point within the triangle represents a definite proportion of each of the three components . If the alti100 per cent , then the sum of figure will also equal 100 per cent . In the figure , the point 0 represents 35 per cent of A , 50 per cent of M , and 15 per cent of C. tude of the triangle represents figure If the binary diagrams A-B , A-C , and B-C are drawn in , they might , in a simple case , appear as shown in Fig. 148 . If now these  | three binary diagrams are stood upright , so that their vertical temperature ordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of triangular base as shown in Fig. 149 . A vertical line rising from any point in the basal triangle represents a certain alloy at a series of temperatures . All such lines intersect with the liquidus surface of irregular shape , at the top of the diagram . A solid model would thus be required to show the new diagram . A photograph of such a model is shown in Fig. 149 , showing the curved liquidus surfaces or " hills , " and the " valleys " between them . Complete Solid Insolubility . The Ternary Eutectic Reaction . An alloy of composition x in Fig. 149 would begin to precipitate crystals when its temperature had intersected the liquidus surface BE1EE3 . The crystals are found , by drawing a horizontal line through x and through the vertical at B , to be pure B crystals . The melt , thus impoverished in B , moves down the liquidus plane in a direction directly away from the vertical B , precipitation of B continuing until the melt reaches the line E3E . At this line , the liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in C and precipitates alternately B and C crystals , as a quasi-binary eutectic , the temperature falling gradually as the liquid moves downward along the line E3E . Enrichment of the liquid in A results from this deposition of B and C material , with the result that , at the point E , saturation in A is reached also . At this point of intersection all three kinds of crystals precipitate alternately , the temperature and the composition of the melt remaining constant until solidification is complete . This point is called a ternary eutectic point . All alloys of this system , chosen for illustration , complete their solidification at this temperature and composition . Hence a horizontal plane , within the body of the model , should be installed at this temperature . It is the solidus plane of the system and lies at a lower temperature than do any of the binary eutectics concerned . The Structures of Ternary Eutectic Alloys. ? The structure of such an alloy would show primary crystals , white in Fig. 150 , surrounded by a quasi-binary eutectic , of crystals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the last regions in the structure to solidify , would be regions of a ternary eutectic of A , B , and C crystals interspersed with each other .  | All alloys will show the ternary eutectic , but both the primary and the secondary crystallizations will be lacking in the ternary eutectic alloy E. The secondary or quasi-binary eutectic crystallization is absent from the alloy y , as shown in the diagram . Obviously , if the x alloy had lain nearer to EI , the secondary crystallization would have contained B and A crystallites instead of B and C crystallites . The structures of other alloys can be inferred readily from these examples . Structure of ternary alloy lead-tin-antimony , showing white cubes ( primary ShSn ) coarse eutectic , secondary , and black background , ternary eutectic . ( Guilett. ) figure Completely Soluble Ternary Alloys. ? Completely soluble ternary alloys would be represented , similarly , by a diagram as shown in Fig. 151 . This case is considerably simpler to follow . Partially Soluble Ternary Alloys. ? The case intermediate between the preceding two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 152 . The solid solubility at room temperature is shown in the enclosed areas of the " posts " at each corner of the basal triangle . Thus the solubility of C for A and B is shown by the area within b3Cc3a3 , etc . The ternary eutectic point is shown at O. The solidus plane below which no liquid exists is the plane EIE2E3 . The " posts " at A , B , and C represent the homogeneous solid-solution alloys.  | Metallic Compounds . When intermetallic compounds are present in ternary systems , it is simplest to divide the diagram into parts , just as was done in the binary systems . A simple figure case of one compound D ( or CAB , ) in the system A-B-C is shown in Fig. 153 . A line drawn from the point D to the opposite angle at A divides the system into two ternary systems C-A-D and D-A-B , each of which can be handled as a separate system . This diagram ( at room temperature ) shows all four components slightly soluble in each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the three corners and at D. The shaded regions are , as usual , two-phase fields . When two compounds figure  | are present , the conditions may be simplified as in Fig. 154 , etc . The absence of a line from E to B in this diagram indicates that this quasibinary alloy system E-B , although possible , is not real but imaginary , at the pressure at which it was investigated . Guertler has shown that if an alloy be prepared of composition corresponding to the intersection of line AD with a line EB , the alloy can ( by the phase rule ) show only two kinds of crystallites . If it shows crystallites of A and D , then the system E-B is imaginary and A-D is real . F ' =mm All lines crossing AD must , therefigure shown in Fig. 155 . Known ternary compounds are Al ? Mg4Cu , NaCdHg , and NaKHg . Others also are known . Sections through the Ternary Model . Another method for showing phase conditions in ternary alloys is to construct a Representation of iron-carbon chromium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram with a constant percentage of the third element present . This method requires , of course , a separate binary diagram for each percentage of the third element which is to be shown , but it has the advantage of being reproducible in one plane . Such sections for the chromium steels of 3 , 15 , and 50 per cent chromium are shown in Fig. 156 . The disappearance of the gamma phase with increasing chromium and c  | the rising of the eutectic and eutectoid temperatures are clearly shown . The eutectic composition decreases from 4.3 per cent carbon for plain cast iron to 2 per cent carbon with 50 per cent of chromium . Selected Literature  | THE PROPERTIES OF ALLOYS General. ? As noted at the beginning of the study of alloys in Part II , one is interested in the internal structure of alloys mainly because the mechanical , physical , and chemical properties of the alloys arise out of their internal structures . The properties of liquid metals change relatively little when foreign atoms are introduced , as compared with the change produced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the properties of liquid alloys vary linearly with the composition , whereas others do not . The specific volume of liquid tin-copper alloys varies linearly from 0 to 62 per cent copper ( Cu ; 3Sn = 62 per cent Cu ) , as shown in Fig. 157 , but further additions of copper have much less effect in lowering the specific volume of tin . '  | The viscosities of the lead-bismuth alloys are somewhat less than the linear values would be . The temperature coefficient of viscosity for any given alloy is nearly linear . ' The surface tension of binary alloys is almost always less than the linear average of that of the two cmnponents.2 The electrical conductivity of liquid alloys follows , in general , the form of curves shown later for solid solutions.3 It seems likely that the non-average properties of liquid alloys result from the presence of intermetallic compounds , molecules partially dissociated , or ionized , in the solvent metal . ' Properties Are Related to Structure. ? If the solidified combination of two metals can result in the variety of structures indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of intermetallic compounds and solid solutions of various types , and in a variety of structural designs composed of these constituents , it is perhaps not surprising that the properties both physical and chemical which accompany them , often deviate greatly from any linear relation with the total composition of the alloy as determined by a chemist . But relationships between alloy structure and alloy properties do exist , and just as the structure can be predicted from the diagram , so also the properties can be arrived at a priori , at least approximately , by the aid of certain rules . The structural constituents of an alloy may , as we have seen , be ( a ) pure metallic crystals , ( b ) unsaturated solid-solution crystals , ( c ) saturated solid-solution crystals , and ( d ) intermetallic compound crystals or a combination of these . These constituents may be of various sizes and arranged in various geometrical patterns . The Strength and Hardness . Duplex Alloys. ? Strength and hardness of alloys may be considered together because both represent resistance of the metal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to tensile stresses , in the other case resistance to indentation or scratching . For an alloy series between two metals nearly insoluble in the solid state , a simple eutectic series , let us say , as shown in Fig. 1585 for  | lead-antimony , the hardness is approximately linear between the hardness of the pure lead and pure antimony and varies with the proportionate weights of the two kinds of crystals present provided always that one constituent is not finely divided so as to form a film around the other or to represent a distinct rise Ilardness of lead-antimony alloys . ( Guertler. ) in surface energy . This case is , therefore , not of particular theoretical interest , although the rule is of value . ' Solid-solution Alloys. ? For solid solutions , on the contrary , the hardness relations are of very great interest . The hardness of either of the pure metals is increased by the entrance of foreign atoms into the crystal lattice . The hardness rises steadily to a maximum at 50 atomic per cent of each metal as shown for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logarithmic equation see Lichteneeker , Z. Elektrochemie , January , 1934 . NOTE : The number of systems showing complete solid insolubility is rapidly dwindling . This one , like many others , is now known to show considerable solubility in this case antimony in lead. 2 Atomic per cent instead of weight per cent requires that the number of atoms shown on the horizontal scale be 100 instead of the total weight of the atoms 100 , as in previous diagrams . If the weight of each of the two kinds of atoms is known , it is simple to calculate the relative number of  | least it is surprising that the addition of atoms of the softer copper to the harder nickel should increase the hardness of the nickel . Hardness of copper-nickel alloys ( also modulus of elasticity ) . ( Guertler . ) The modulus of elasticity for these alloys is also shown . To strengthen a pure metal by alloying , the best method is , therefore , often to add another element which will dissolve in the atoms . If an alloy is composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic weight A , and of q per cent of the element B , of atomic weight B , then its A 100p 100q ( AB content iii atomic per cent is and its B content is A  | crystals of the pure metal , that is , to form a solid solution . The added metal may be either softer or harder than the host metal . Rosenhain believes the strange atoms being of a different size distort the native space lattice of the host metal and thus interfere with smooth gliding along cleavage planes in the crystallites . ' Since solid solubility is limited by the capacity of the native space lattice to undergo distortion in accommodating foreign atoms , therefore the solid-solubility limit corresponds to the maximum distortion of which the lattice is capable . Thus , sparingly soluble additions should produce great distortion and great hardness , even when present in small amounts . Table XII shows results for lead alloys by Ludwick ' which seem to support this theory . figure Advantage of this increase in hardness and strength is taken in the industrial brasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tin , and other elements are dissolved in the host crystallites and strengthen them ; in the addition of copper to gold in jewelry and coinage , in monel metal , and also in the alloy steels , particularly as in nickel-steel , where the added elements dissolve in the ferrite or the iron lattice . The identification of the Pt-Rh wire in a thermocouple is easy if both wires are bent . The alloy wire is harder to bend than is the pure platinum one . The hardness of single crystals of solid solutions has been studied by Elam . ' Theories of Solution Hardness . Tammann4 believes the hardness of solid solutions to arise because the force of attraction 1 Proc . Roy . Soc . ( London ) , 99A , 196 ( 1921 ) . 2 Z. anorg . Chem. , 94 , 161 ( 1917 ) . 3 Proc . Roy . Soc . ( London ) , 109A , 143 ( 1925 ) . 4 " Textbook of Metallography , " p. 291 , Chemical Publishing Company , New York , 1925.  | of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution is always greater than the force of attraction of two similar atoms for each other . Consequently the internal pressure in the crystal , which is determined by the sum of the forces of attraction per unit of surface , increases upon the addition of a second substance and reaches a maximum ( of hardness ) for equal atomic concentration of the two substances . If partially soluble alloys are quenched from a high temperature , the age-hardening effect described on page 191 takes place , with very great increase in both hardness and strength . Alloys containing submicroscopic precipitates do not fall under the rules now being studied . Metallic Compounds . For compounds of two metals in a chemical molecule the rule is that the intermetallic compound is almost without exception harder ( exception : MoS2 ) than either of the combining elements , just as are the solid solutions . But such compounds possess very little of the formability of solid solutions and are usually very brittle , often to the point of pulverizing when stressed . ' They retain this hardness up to quite high temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( tungsten and tantalum carbides ) . A very small proportion of a metallic compound will often lend stiffness and rigidity to an otherwise soft and yielding metal , as for instance Fe3C in ductile iron , CuAl2 in soft aluminum , etc . It is because of the preponderance of such compounds , however , that certain alloys of the ductile metals copper and aluminum are , surprisingly enough , almost as brittle as glass , namely those certain alloys in which a compound of copper with aluminum ( CuAl or CuAl2 ) predominates . The compounds of iron with nitrogen are formed in the process of nitriding steel to form a hard surface ( see Fig. 197 , Chap X ) . The hard particles of SbSn in babbitt bearing metal support the moving part . The Properties of a Whole Series of Alloys. ? Knowing the hardness behavior of ( 1 ) solid solutions , ( 2 ) of metallic compounds and ( 3 ) of aggregates or mixtures of any two of these in a single alloy , we are ready to examine the hardness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be present . In Fig. 160 , for illustration , the hardness of pure A rises rapidly as long as the A lattice can take material containing B atoms ( urnen , iat , Dletalltechnischer Kalendar , 1926 , p. 212.  | into solid solution . AzB shows its characteristic high hardness value . Mixtures of saturated A solid-solution crystals and AJ3 , , crystals have hardness proportional to the amount of each one present , as shown by the straight line connecting the hardness figures of the two . From AsB , to saturated B the hardness drops steadily with increase in the amount of the softer B solid solution present in the alloy . In this series the hardness of the entire alloy system may be - plotted if the hardness of pure A , IL 410 pure B , of pure A . By , and of the saturated solutions of A and of B is known .

Alloying usually reduces the formability of the pure metals , although not so far but that both Composition solid solutions and insoluble aggrefigure Duplex Alloys . Insoluble additions as sulphur in iron or in nickel may , however , form brittle envelopes of sulphides around each grain destroying completely the formability of the alloy . Thus 0.01 per cent of sulphur in electrolytic iron renders it entirely brittle both when hot and cold , due to softening of the envelopes when hot , brittleness when cold . If manganese is added to the melt it combines with the sulphur in the iron and forms tiny globules of MnS which thus collect the sulphur and eliminate the grain boundary brittleness . Similarly 0.01 per cent sulphur in nickel forms an alloy so brittle that it will  | fly to pieces if struck by a hammer , due to films of Ni2S3 at the grain boundaries . The addition of 0.05 per cent magnesium to the melt converts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaves , the formability of the nickel unimpaired . Similarly 0.005 per cent of lead renders gold brittle due to a gold compound at the grain boundaries . Hydrogen in iron after pickling also produces brittleness . Thus the location and form of the constituents of an aggregate play very important parts in determining the formability of the metal . The influence of a brittle constituent is very much lessened when it is dispersed throughout a continuous plastic phase than when it occurs in continuous envelopes at the grain boundaries . Steel containing iron carbide but less than 0.7 per cent carbon is plastic . Solid Solutions. ? The ductility of solid solutions is often greater than that of the pure components of the solution , for drawing them through a die strengthens them rapidly and thus permits further reduction in size . The force required to cause deformation is , however , always higher than it is for pure metals . The rapid hardening of solid solutions upon deformation is illustrated in the stamping of stainless steel for automobile headlights . Fine-grained metal usually has better formability than coarse-grained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity of an alloy composed of a conglomerate of two kinds of crystallites is not proportional to the specific gravity of each crystallite present . But the reciprocal of the specific gravity ; that is , the specific volume is quite closely so proportional . The specific volume V of a given alloy containing n per cent by volume of A crystallites and 100 ? n per cent by volume of B crystallites is equal to figure The reciprocal of this sum gives the specific gravity of the alloy considered . This same rule holds very closely for solid-solution series , although there may be slight contraction in volume ( less than 0.5 per cent ) causing a lower value than calculated . The specific volumes of the copper-tin alloys are shown , at several temperaiures in Fig. 157.  | The specific volumes of intermetallic compounds deviate somewhat from this rule , but due to the small proportions of such compounds present in engineering materials the above rule may be used with a satisfactory degree of accuracy . The coefficient of thermal expansion is the change in specific volume with change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated by the law of averages from the coefficients of the respective constituents of the alloy by the formula Nca+-b ) = nfa + ( 100 ? IbQb The specific gravities and coefficients of expansion of the pure metals are given in Table IV on pages 63 to 65 . While each alloy in a series of duplex alloys has a cubical expansion in linear ratio to its composition , the same is not true of solid-solution series . Guillaume2 investigated the thermal dilatation of nickel steels . Nickel steel with 36 per cent nickel has a vanishingly small thermal expansion as shown in Fig. 161.3 Invar , an alloy of this composition , is used in the manufacture of scales , pendulums , surveying tapes , etc. , and as struts in aluminum automobile pistons to adapt the expansion of the piston to that of the cast-iron cylinder . The alloys with 43 per cent nickel have the same coefficient of cubical expansion as glass and are used at the seal in incandescent lamps instead of platinum . No general rule can be given for this property . ' GUERTLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les applications des aciers au nickel , " Gautier Villars , Paris , 1904 . TAMMANN , " Lehrbuch der Metallkunde , " 4th ed. , Leopold Voss , Leipzig , 1932.  | The Specific Heats of Alloys. ? The mean specific heat of an interrnetallic compound is additive of the specific heats of its constituent atoms . So also is the specific heat of a conglomerate of two crystalline varieties in an alloy . The Melting Points of Alloys . The melting point and freezing range of alloys are , of course , given in the constitutional diagram of each alloy series . The Color of Alloys . If a gray metal is alloyed with copper or gold , the natural reddish colors will , when sufficient gray metal has been added , gradually disappear . For example , the gray color first appears in copper when 20 per cent palladium , 23 per cent nickel , or 22 per cent manganese has been added , smaller additions revealing a yellow or yellowish gray tint . Forty per cent platinum , 19 per cent aluminum , or 50 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its color as the amount of gray metal in solid solution is increased . Below 65 per cent gold , the gold-silver alloys are a greenish yellow . Below 30 per cent gold they are white . ' Gold is colored gray by the addition of 5 per cent of tin or 4 per cent of bismuth . The Electrical Conductivity of Alloys. ? The resistance r of a metallic conductor is directly proportional to its length 1 and inversely proportional to its sectional area q , or If 1 = 1 cm. length , and q = 1 sq . cm. sectional area , then r = p ; the resistance of a symmetrical cube , whose edges are each 1 cm. , is called the " specific resistance " of the metal , and its reciprocal value is called the " specific conductance " or conductivity . Thus it is the volume of a conductor , not the weight with which one is concerned . The electrical conductivity of the pure metals is given in Table IV , pages 63 to 65 . Duplex Alloys. ? When an alloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductivity of any particular alloy will be almost proportional to the volume of each variety of crystallite in the alloy and to the specific conductance of each variety ( assuming a random orientation with no fiber structure ) .  | Just as we can imagine a bar built up of alternate uniform blocks of iron and copper , the conductance of the bar would depend rather on the total volume of each metal present than on the weight of each metal present . While this relationship holds rather accurately for the tin-cadmium alloys , as shown Cadmium with Zinc , Tin , and Lead Electrical conductivity of some cadmium alloys . ( Guertler. ) in Fig. 162 , the conductivity is slightly lower than calculated for those of zinc-cadmium and lead-cadmium . ' The logarithmic rule mentioned on page 204 gives more accurate results . Obviously , if a continuous oxide film enveloped each grain in an alloy , the conductivity would be very low , oxides usually being high in dielectric strength . Solid Solutions. ? The conductivity of pure metals drops astonishingly when even a minute quantity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 , p. 260.  | is dissolved in its crystal lattice , that is , when a solid solution is formed . Figure 163 shows the conductivity of the alloys of gold and silver . The conductivity curve takes the form of a catenary . ( Not , however , like a chain uniformly loaded and hanging between two points , but like a chain whose loading decreases as the distance from its supports increases , or like two blacksnake whips hung up by their handles and with the lashes tied together . ) With this rapid fall in conductivity near the pure metals , we at once appreciate why the electrical industry demands copper of very high purity . For example , absolutely pure copper Conductivity of gold-silver alloys. has a conductivity of 64 X 104 , while 99.95 per cent pure copper has only 56 X 104 reciprocal ohms per centimeter cube . This five-hundredths of a per cent of impurity has decreased the conductivity by more than 12 per cent . Furthermore a drop is caused even if the metal added be a very good conductor . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of a few per cent reduces the conductivity of the nickel . The effect of various impurities on the conductivity of copper is shown in Fig. 164 . If the copper for electrical conduction is to be strengthened and hardened by creating a solid solution in it of a second element , it is clear the silicon offers distinct advantages over phosphorus . Cadmium up to 1 per cent is even better as it raises the tensile strength nearly 100 per cent with only 10 per cent loss in conductivity . This alloy lasts three times as long as pure copper for trolley-wire service . If high-resistance windings for an electric furnace or rheostat are to be designed ,  | on the other hand , the more concentrated solid solutions are sought . Intermetallic compounds have a conductivity which is always lower than the linear value calculated from the quantity of each constituent and its conductivity . If the compound forms solid solutions , its conductivity is further lowered according to the rule for solid solutions . Conductivities of a Series of Alloys. ? Combining these three types : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various " impurities " on the electrical conductivity of copper . ( ' zochralski , Z. 11clallknnde , 18 , 1 ( 1926 ) . compound , we have a diagram like Fig. 165 for the alloys of silver and magnesium . From pure Ag , pure Mg , and pure MgAg , the curves drop rapidly for the solid solutions . For aggregates of saturated solid solutions , the relation is a straight line , the conductivity depending on the amount of each crystal variety present . Thus , in general , if we know the conductivity of the saturated solid solution , points B and C , points D and E , and points G and H , we can use the law of mixtures for any alloys between these points . The possibility of ever finding an alloy which conducts better than shown by the rule of mixtures for its components is thus denied . Figure 166 shows the very interesting diagram for the annealed Au-Cu alloys . The quenched alloys of this system ( or those tested at 500 ? C. as shown in Fig. 166 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' the Au-Ag  | alloys of Fig. 163 owing to supercooling ( or decomposition of ) the compounds AuCu and AuCu3 . The heat conductivity of alloys follows closely parallel to the electrical conductivity according to the law of Wiedemann Electrical conductivities and temperature coefficients for alloys of magnesium-silver . ( Tammann. ) and Franz . This property changes with the composition in approximately the same way as developed above for electrical conductivity . The Temperature Coefficient of Conductivity. ? Both these conductivities change with changes of temperature , and for most , metals the conductivity decreases with rise iii temperature .  | Just as solid solutions show a low conductivity so also they show a low-temperature coefficient of conductivity . The temperature coefficient for the alloys of silver and magnesium is also shown in Fig. 165 . Alloys for potentiometers , bridges , galvanometers , and similar precision instruments should change their resistance as little as possible with changes in temperature . This service would also seek concentrated solid-solution alloys . Conductivity isotherms and temperature coefficient of the annealed copper-gold alloys . ( Tammann . ) Hence alloys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent nickel ) and manganin ( 84 per cent copper , 12 per cent nickel , and 4 per cent manganese ) , which have a temperature coefficient of practically zero in any ordinary range of temperature are used . Their conductivity is about 0.05 that of copper . This invariability of resistivity is probably due to a non-equilibrium condition in the alloy , for after prolonged heating ( for instance , by the electric current ) the resistivity changes and becomes normal . Cold working the alloys results in a small decrease in their electrical conductivity ( see Chap . III ) . Chromium-nickel alloys are said to be an exception to this rule .  | The Magnetic Properties of Alloys . Metallic bodies when placed within a magnetic field may either concentrate or disperse the lines of force of the field . Bodies of the former type are termed " paramagnetic . " Those which disperse the lines are called " diamagnetic . " An especially high capability for concentrating the lines of force is shown by the metals iron , cobalt , and nickel , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These three metals lose their peculiar property completely at certain critical temperatures ; iron at 769 ? C. , cobalt at 1100 ? C. and nickel at 350 ? C. ( see Fig. 45 , page 59 ) . figure The compounds FeO , Fe3O4 , Fe203 , FeS , also Fe3P and Fe2P as well as Fe3C , are ferromagnetic . As a usual rule , aside from these exceptions , it may be stated that ferromagnetism is destroyed by the process of chemical combination . ' Figure 167 shows the hysteresis loss of some ironcarbon alloys . The rapid rise up to 0.005 per cent is due to carbon in solid solution in alpha iron . Apparently carbon-free iron would be without hysteresis loss . Certain steels , notably those containing tungsten , molybdenum , and cobalt , have the property of becoming permanent magnets and are used in the electrical industry . Austenitic steels such as the 14 per cent manganese , the 25 per cent nickel , and others are non-magnetic because the iron is present in the gamma , or non-magnetic , form . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alpha transition gradually takes place and magnetism returns . I TAMMANN , Op . Cit. , p. 281.  | Permalloy is a magnetic nickel-iron alloy with high permeability at low field strengths . This value for annealed steel is 40 , for electrolytic iron 400 to 800 , and for permalloy 12,000 . But , if even slightly cold worked , permalloy loses this high value . The magnetic hysteresis is very low also . It is used in telephone equipment and as loading tape in submarine cables . The 50-50 nickel-iron alloy also has high permeability at low field strengths . It is used in the radio field . Magnetic properties of the Heussler alloys . Surprising is the discovery of Heussler who found that alloys of manganese with non-ferromagnetic metals exhibit ferromagnetic properties . Figure 168 shows the magnetic susceptibility of the manganese-antimony alloys . Here is a case where synthesis of two metals produces an alloy with a property almost totally lacking in both of its constituents . An alloy of 61 per cent copper , 26 manganese , and 13 aluminum gives even better results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two unlike metal wires are joined and the junction end is heated hotter than the other ends of the wires , a difference of potential will be set up between the hot and cold ends , and , if the circuit is closed , a current will flow in it . Conversely , a current flowing through such a junction will cause a heating effect at the junction ( Peltier  | effect ) . The magnitude of the thermal e.m.f. is proportional to the rate of heat flow from the hot to the cold ends of the wires , and therefore to the thermal conductivity of the wires . For alloys of the various types solid solutions , aggregates , and intermetallic compounds the thermal e.m.f. , as measured in contact with either of the pure metals , seems to follow the curves given above for electrical conductivity ( and by the law of Wiedemann and Franz for thermal conductivity ) of alloys of these types . Piezo Electricity. ? Mention might also be made of the piezoelectric effect . If a crystal ( for example , quartz ) is compressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with it . Conversely , if an alternating current is sent through such a crystal it will oscillate ( expand and contract ) . The frequency of the current will determine the frequency of the oscillation . The Chemical Properties of Duplex Alloys . If an alloy consists of two varieties of crystallites , its stability or resistance to corrosion will in general be that of the least stable crystal present , or less . The galvanic-cell action which occurs when two unlike metals are joined and immersed in a conducting solution is well known . Countless small local currents flow between the two unlike metal grains of the alloy and back through the electrolyte or corrosive fluid , at the surface of the metal , thereby rapidly dissolving the less " noble " or anodic grains . Thus duplex alloys ( those containing two crystalline varieties ) are usually very rapidly corroded . The slower corrosion of pure iron ( ferrite ) as compared with steel ( ferrite and cementite ) is a familiar example . It seems , however , to be the Si , P , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrolytic iron . The carbide probably has a potential not much different from that of iron ( Tammann ) . Striking is the corrosion rate of chemically pure zinc , aluminum , and nickel which is only a fraction ( for Zn 1/10,000 ) of that for the commercial metals . If 0.001 per cent gold is added to zinc , the rate of solution in 0.5N hydrochloric acid is doubled . Intercrystalline corrosion is probably due to the presence of a second phase at the grain boundaries . The caustic embrittlement of boiler steel seems to be due to alkalinity of the feed water and to intercrystalline attack as shown in Fig. 169.  | Alloys of aluminum with silicon are duplex in structure but have increased corrosion resistance as compared with pure aluminum because , upon dissolving , the silicon forms a film of SiO2 ? xH2O , which exerts a powerful protective action . ' An addition of 0.02 per cent Al to Zn , or of Mg to Al , seems to decrease the rate of solution . Apparently the base-metal atoms form anodic spots , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Solid Solutions. ? If the additions form a solid solution with the original metal , the case is quite l 169. - Grain boundary corrosion of steel by alkaline solution ( " caustic embrittlement " ) . ( O. Schwarz. ) different . Here lies a possibility of raising the resistance to corrosion of the original metal by addition of a small amount of a second metal . Thus gold added to copper in jewelry improves its chemical stability . This stability is lost , however , for some alloys , if the temperature is raised much above the boiling point of water . The improvement in stability produced occurs at certain predetermined proportions of atoms of the added element and in fractions of % , % , etc. ; that is , when % of the atoms of the base metal are replaced by added metal atoms , a sudden improvement in stability may be looked for . If it does not appear at gig , then it will not appear until the proportion is 2g ( 25 atomic per cent ) , etc . In parting the alloys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; H mole gold , hot nitric acid will not produce any solution of metal , as Koster and Miller , Z. Metallkunde , 19 , 52 ( 1927 ) .  | shown in Fig. 170 . From gold alloys of #8 down to gold , the amount of extraction increases with decrease of gold content . In alloys below % gold the soluble metal is completely extracted . Thus we see that , ifg gold or more is present , it protects the copper or silver completely from attack by nitric acid . The copper or silver has been " ennobled " by the addition of gold which formed a solid solution with it . This case is exemplified by the parting limits of gold-silver alloys in assaying . If gold is present above a certain amount , the metals can not be parted even by boiling nitric acid . If they are remelted and more silver added , they part readily in the acid . Fraction ( a ) of the soluble metal extracted from various gold-silver and copper-silver alloys by hot nitric acid . ( Tammann . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammann ' in terms of the geometry of the space lattice of the solid solutions . He assumes ( which recent X-ray studies deny ) a uniform distribution of foreign and native atoms throughout the crystal lattice . The nobler atoms stand at one or more of the eight corners of the cube ( in cubic ' lattices ) and prevent the ingress of the attacking solvent ions as Cl , NO3 , for instance , thus protecting the base atoms from solution . A more recent theory , supported by X-ray analysis of the etched surfaces of gold-copper alloys , finds that the corrosion limit is due to the formation of a continuous layer of gold atoms ( or ions ) at the surface of the specimen , or to the absence of " coherent paths " Op. cit.  | of soluble atoms . ' This behavior , however explained , gives us a means for using baser metals for corrosion resistance after first ennobling them by the addition of a small percentage of a nobler and more costly metal . This principle is of very great importance industrially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series and for each corrosive solvent . At elevated temperatures the resistance limits disappear due to diffusion of the noble atoms out of their positions . As noted in Chap . II , the early stages of corrosion at a metal surface may form a film of oxide as in the case of aluminum or of hydroxide as in the case of magnesium , which film is impervious to the further ingress of oxygen into the metal . These natural protective films play a very important part in corrosion resistance of certain metals and alloys . The presence of the film on aluminum may be demonstrated by heating electrically a fine aluminum wire suspended between supports . The wire melts but remains hanging , supported by the unmelted film . The addition of alloying elements may in some cases improve the tenacity of the film as , for example , the addition of Mn to Mg . The copper-bearing steels ( 0.2 to 1.0 per cent copper ) resist atmospheric corrosion better than ordinary steel , apparently owing to an invisible film of copper which forms over the steel surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " passivity " of the metal surface . Iron if dipped into concentrated nitric acid loses the ability to precipitate silver or copper subsequently from sulphate solutions . It has become " passive , " apparently due to a layer or film of molecular oxygen on its surface . The catalytic action of metals , such as platinum sponge for instance , is usually attributed to a layer of gas adsorbed on the surface of the metal . The same condition of passivity may be produced on iron that is anodically polarized in a sulphuric acid solution . While this passive condition of iron is transient , that of alumino-thermically extracted chromium is retained . Both metals dissolve rapidly , however , in a warm hydrochloric acid solution . Both metals lose their passivity upon cathodic polarization in an acid electrolyte where nascent hydrogen is evolved . But , whereas iron after this latter treatment dissolves ' See MASINC , Trans. , A.I.M.E . Institute of Metals Div. , vol. 104 ( 1933 ) .  | or oxidizes in a sulphuric acid solution or in nearly pure water , chromium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the solid solutions of iron with chromium as in the " stainless " steels the chromium lends its passivity to the iron , when chromium is present in sufficient amount . This amount of chromium is determined by measuring the change in potential ( electrochemical ) of chromium-iron alloys after they have been cathodically polarized in a 0.05 mol H2SO4 solution . It is found that steels with more than 15 per cent Cr become spontaneously less reactive ( more passive ) , while those with 15 per cent or less do not . Anodic polarization of chromium steels renders them less reactive , but the effect is transient . Tammann and Softer ' have measured the final potential of a number of chromium steels against the hydrogen electrode with the following results : figure The steels with 15 per cent Cr or less are equally reactive after anodic and cathodic polarization ; but those with 20 per cent Cr and more become spontaneously passive even after cathodic polarization . Chromium steels can be divided into two classes of passivity in another way : The steels from 0 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volt but are passive at voltages higher than this . Those from 20 to 40 per cent Cr transmit only a very small current through the cell even at voltages up to 2.1 volts . Whereas the former series of chromium steels is at first active and becomes passive above 0.9 volt only , the latter series is passive from the beginning and similar to a platinum electrode . Scratches on the surface diminish the i Z. anon/ . Chortle , 127 , 257 ( 1923 ) .  | passivity , probably due to the potential differences between cold-worked and normal metal regions on the scratched surface ( or to destruction of the film ) . The idea that certain alloys containing Cr , Co , Ni , and Fe are " acid-proof " and suitable for substitution in place of platinum , means only that they are not attacked by concentrated nitric acid . In dilute acids , especially warm hydrochloric acid , or when oxygen access is limited , they dissolve as do all " passive " metals . Treatment with this ( and other ) acids or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which passivity depends . Chromium forms this layer spontaneously both in water and in air , while the more active iron rusts because the protecting layer of oxygen does not cling tightly to the surface . The Corrosion of Alloys. ? Corrosion is defined by Professor Guertlerl as the gradual chemical attack of a metal under the influence of a moist atmosphere or of a natural or artificial solution . Its importance in metallurgy is indicated by the use of paints , enamels , and porcelain on metal structures , by the growing use of rustless steels , by the widespread use of zinc , nickel , and chromium as coatings , and by the immense tonnage of metals scrapped each year as a result of the ravages of corrosion , where these and other preventives have not been applied or have not sufficed . Simple atmospheric corrosion is of far greater importance than is the corrosion due to chemicals , for water and air are everywhere present . Both air and liquid water are necessary for atmospheric corrosion , but even objects protected from rain will have liquid water condensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture . Many theories of corrosion have been advanced , most of them concerned with iron and steel because of its extensive use and rapid corrosion . The most widely held theory at present is as follows : Iron , lying above hydrogen in the table of electrochemical potentials , can displace hydrogen atoms from H2O . It sends iron ions ( Fe++ ) into solution in water , displacing hydrogen ions ( H+ ) in H2O . Soon the layer of water surrounding the object will contain Fe++ and 20H- ions , that is , dissociated Fe(OH)2 , in considerable concentration . If oxygen or air is Metalltechnischcr Kalendar , 1926 , p. 88.  | admitted to this layer ( by diffusion through the water ) , Fe(OH)3 forms . This is less soluble than Fe(OH)2 and precipitates as a brown deposit . Since it forms not at the surface of the metal itself but in the adjacent solution , it does not cling tightly to the iron , and does not protect it from further rusting , but scales off readily . It , or its later decomposition products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished piece of iron is corked up in a test tube full of boiled water , containing no air , rusting will not occur . If the cork is removed , the precipitate of Fe(OH)3 forms rapidly . Both water and oxygen are necessary to corrosion of iron . Iron tanks , for instance , corrode faster if the water is flowing through them than if it is still . They corrode faster if they are filled and emptied , thus being exposed to air , than if they are kept full . Corrosion is more rapid when the air contains CO2 and SO2 , which form acids in the water . In concentrated alkaline solutions iron readily becomes passive , apparently because iron does not take on a hydrogen charge ( Fe + 2HOH = Fe(OH)2 + 2H+ ) , and because Fe(OH)2 is less soluble in alkaline solution than it is in water . Another factor , one of electrolytic nature , differential aeration , seems to play a part in the corrosion even of a pure metal . An iron sheet dipped into water with air above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water surface , but it corrodes rapidly deeper down in the water . Apparently the oxygen concentration is higher near the surface of the water and an electrolytic current flows between the two regions of different oxygen concentration . The region richer in oxygen is cathodic and does not dissolve rapidly , while the lower region is anodic in this " oxygen concentration cell " and dissolves rapidly . In many practical instances one part of an object which is partly protected from access of oxygen will corrode more rapidly than an adjacent part which is exposed to a greater concentration of oxygen . For example , a pile of galvanized iron sheets showed more corrosion at the center of each sheet where oxygen was partially excluded than at the outer edges . The lower part of a city gas reservoir , where the metal was bathed with a gas which displaced oxygen from the water seal , corroded more than the
