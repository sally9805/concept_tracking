txt Heavy buying of actual hides was reported yesterday at advanced prices . Trade circles stated that good underlying demand for this spot commodity remains . Leading packers sold substantial quantities , totaling 59,000 pieces , with calfskin and branded cows scoring cent price increases . Endicott-Johnson , a leading shoe manufacturer , was credited with buying good-sized quantities of Southern small packers ' hides . Special from Boston News Bureau BOSTON  --  Rarely has the shoe industry , In New England and elsewhere , witnessed so sharp a curtailment in output as has occurred since August . Seldom has the price situation been more " up in the air " and in the short space of six months conditions have changed completely from a seller 's to a buyer 's market . Readjustment is going forward apace , with steady liquidation of shoe inventories in the hands of wholesalers and retailers , and wage reductions spreading among the host of smaller units in New England shoe manufacture , especially those engaged in production of women 's footwear . It is an aftermath of too sanguine expectations early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wave of rapidly rising prices . Yet because of the rapidity of the decline in production , the fall in prices of raw materials and the long drought of orders , some forward looking shoe manufacturers anticipate a comparatively early stabilization which may lead to resumption of business . This is based on belief that hide and akin prices and also leather may be " grounding on bottom " rather than heading for any further sharp decline , and also that shoe stocks , which have been in process of liquidation for months , may , after the January sales , be trimmed down to about normal proportions . Await General Business Confidence Much depends upon the general business picture . If confidence is established , according to one important shoe manufacturer , the shoe industry should be in a position-to go ahead , although on a production basis substantially below that of the high levels of the first half of 1937 . It Is pointed out that the large mail order houses , such as Sears , Roebuck and Montgomery Ward , normally big factors in the shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New England shoe circles is that they will probably have to place business in January for the spring trade and that such buying is apt to signalize a turn for the better . It would probably indicate a stabilization in the price structure . Some of the important shoe chain stores have already cut prices Regal stores the first of December reduced two lines of men 's shoes from $5 and $6.40 to $9.85 and $5.85 , respectively . A month ago they dropped women 's shoes 50 cents a pair . W. L Douglas stores 2n late October reduced the " Moderns " line from $3.95 to $3.65 and prior to that the A. S Beck chain cut from $4.45 to $3.98 . Spring Line Prices May Be Lower These reductions , no doubt , anticipated , the naming of lower prices by manufacturers on spring lines . These prices are expected to be at least 5% to 10% below recently prevailing levels on so-called popular priced lines . The New England shoe industry is estimated to be operating at present only about 40% of normal , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Leather Association . This is due chiefly to current business conditions and the influx of low-priced women 's cemented shoes from abroad , chiefly from Czechoslovakia . It is pointed out that while these shoe imports amount to only about 1% of total domestic production of all shoes , they are about 10% of New England 's production of that type of footwear . Mr. Stone says that the temper of the trade ie " pessimistic " because of the lack of any large backlog of orders , but points out that there has been a slight improvement within the past two weeks . New Hampshire Holds 1CV Best The extent and rapidity of curtailment in the shoe industry as compared with last year is indicated by the fact that production of shoe factories in Massachusetts in October was off 34.4% from October , 1936 ; Maine , still suffering from effects of the late summer strike in the Lewiston-Auburn district , was down from a year ago , while New Hampshire aided by the better than average operations of the J. F. Co. , which manufactures for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the country as a whole in October showed a decline of 27.9% from the same month last year . Although output of the country 's factories as a whole in the first six months of 1937 ran at a record-breaking rate and was 19.4% above the total for the corresponding period of 1936 , reversal since then , which really started in Aug-ust has been so sharp that prospects are that the total output for 1937 will fall below the 1936 peak of 415,227,276 pairs . Wage reductions , where they have been made by New England shoe factories , generally average and apply largely to special situations or to localities affected by peculiar conditi. , ns . Already , there is a list of more than 20 companies which have made such reductions In a broad way they wipe out advances in cages granted within the past year , mostly earl . in 1937 . Haverhill Plants Hit by Imported Shoes In Haverhill manufacturers making an Inexpensive type of women 's shoes , known as " $2 and $3 retailers " , affected particularly by Czechoslovakian and also by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts Board of Conciliation and Arbitration , secured a wage revision amounting to about 121% , which makes possible a re:urn to the $2 and $3 retail price from $2 35 and $3 35 where they have been selling . There is. however , apparently no present disposition on the part of the large volume producers , such as the International Shoe Co which has factories in New Hampshire as ti ell as elsewhere in the country , the J. F. Co. , with factories also in New Hampshire . or the Endicott Johnson Corp. , with factories in : dew York State . to cut wages . The possibility of more general revision of wage le% els . s recognized if shoe manufacture fails to score the expected pick-up in the early part of next year .
