The independence of India has just been proclaimed by potent Mahatma Gandhi at Lahore ( see col. 3 ) . Last week Englishmen were doubly vexed by almost exactly similar news from Cairo . There Mustapha Nahas Pasha , whose Wafd Party has just swept the country and won the Egyptian Parliamentary Election by a majority of more than 19 to 1 over their combined opponents , addressed the following letter to fat King Fuad , notoriously a British puppet : <P> " It becomes my duty to inform Your Majesty that as Prime Minister I shall proceed to effect a revision of the Constitution which will secure the full and complete independence of Egypt .
