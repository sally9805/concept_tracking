In Washington last week highdomed SEC Commissioner Jerome Frank lay in bed suffering with pneumonia . But even as he did so he added a chapter to depression economic philosophy . Before a meeting of the National Association of Securities Commissioners in Kansas City , husky SEC Lawyer Chester Lane read a speech that Commissioner Frank had written , a speech that excited comment in financial circles , drew even an approving nod from the arch-Republican New York Herald Tribune . <P> Mr. Frank 's thesis was embodied in a question " Is it perhaps not desirable that the bulk of long-time financing of our major American industries should hereafter be done through the issuance of shares of stock , rather than by borrowings through the issuance of long-term bonds ? " Taking the railroads as the classic example of an industry weighed down with fixed charges , * he pointed out that when a railroad fails , bondholders suffer just about as much as preferred stockholders . <P> Theoretically , bonds are direct obligations and property can be sold to retire them . <P> Actually a road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the reorganization but suffer from write-downs in the formation of the new company . <P> What is true of railroads , Mr. Frank held , is generally true of other industries . <P> Not only the company or industry affected , but the whole economic system suffers from the bludgeoning effect of fixed maturities falling due during depressions , and the freezing of capital due to defaults . Even in industries where defaults do not occur , fixed charges exercise a downward leverage on public purchasing power , a leverage that affects not only dividends but wages . <P> These recognized depression phenomena have already given rise to one New Deal theory , that " Saving makes a rainy day " ( because savings are translated into loans to industry , increasing fixed charges ) . This theory , of which the leading exponent is David Cushman Coyle ( a consulting engineer of the National Resources Board ) , arrives at the inevitable conclusion that the way to prevent depressions is to reduce savings by heavy taxation on the people who save , i.e. , the well-to-do . The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank 's theory is another approach to the problem : not to prevent saving but to prevent it from being translated into fixed charges . Emphasizing that his proposal was not officially inspired , he pointed out its major difficulty : the necessity of changes in State laws to allow banks and insurance companies to invest in stocks . Preferred securities he maintained would be just as sound investments for banks if they carried voting control when dividends were in arrears , thereby giving preferred stockholders the right to force a change in management . <P> * The B. &; O. last week announced that its subsidiary , the Alton R. R. , would default on its 3% bonds on October 1 .
