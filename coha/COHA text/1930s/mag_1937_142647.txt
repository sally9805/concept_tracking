In 1911 Charles Thomson Rees Wilson of Cambridge University invented a " cloud chamber " in which tracks made by sub-atomic particles could be seen . At about the same time Hans Geiger , now of the University of Tubingen , invented a cylindrical " counter " which crackles every time a particle enters it . Physicists use both devices , alone or together , to record the presence of and identify cosmic rays , gamma rays , X-rays , photons , electrons , protons , positrons , neutrons . <P> There is still plenty to be learned about all these forces , but that did not prevent Drs . Jabez Curry Street &; Edward Carl Stevenson of Harvard from announcing last week that they had discovered a brand-new cosmic particle which the heavens rain upon the earth . It has a negative electrical charge like an electron , but seems to weigh ten times as much and have a thousand times as much energy , easily passing through four Geiger counters , two cloud chambers and seven inches of lead . <P> Scarcely did the Harvard men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than from Pasadena came word that Dr. Carl David Anderson of California Institute of Technology , Nobel Prize-winning discoverer of the positron , had independently discovered the new entity in his laboratory .
