BLIND MAN 'S YEAR-Warwick Deeping - Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> Tears mixed with ink often result in a sticky substance resembling treacle . Though the formula would not be recognized by a chemist , it is well known to some popular writers . And there is nothing so pleasing to some tastes as a good mouthful of treacle . Gene Stratton Porter was an expert at this mixture ; so is A. S. M. Hutchinson . In Sorrel and Son Warwick Deeping had the formula just about right , but last week his latest novel showed that even specialists in sad-gladness can not always hit the proper ratio , that too many sobs spoil the ink . Only a nursery word like ooky-gooky or perhaps icky-poo could justly describe Blind Man 's Year . <P> Says Rosamund , the novelist who is the heroine of Deeping 's story : " One must suffer in order to be able to say things , my dear . " She is only talking to her faithful dog , being too shy to say it to anyone else , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been able to say a great deal , and has become a bestseller . Her shyness arises from the fact that she was born with a nevus ( strawberry-mark ) all over her left cheek , and at 35 she is a recluse . Except for her blemish she is much better looking and more intelligent than her two older sisters , who have both married , though they are nasty creatures . They hate Rosamund for her success , are always borrowing money from her . Except for them , she has almost no truck with the outside world . <P> Rosamund is not content . She has her friend , her work , her dog , her faithful retainers and a very nice place , as private as possible , overlooking the sea . But she sometimes considers throwing herself over the cliff . Then , one foggy day , a plane crashes in the woods above her house . Rosamund is the only one near ; she runs for help , has the battered pilot carried to her house . The poor fellow is so badly smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him up for dead . He comes around eventually , turns out to be 24 , good-looking , extremely sensitive , an orphan , and a gentleman through and through . His name is Clive . After he and Rosamund have begun to fall in love , Clive is removed to a hospital . It devolves on Rosamund to tell him that he will always be blind . <P> But she also tells him that . she loves him . They are married , start facing life together . Clive learns Braille and type writing , fits himself to become her secretary . Rosamund , fired by his courage , buys a car , takes a house in London , shows herself in the world . In spite of the disparity in their ages , Clive 's blind ness and Rosamund 's birthmark , their marriage is a success . Author Deeping tactfully leaves them with the arrival of their first baby .
