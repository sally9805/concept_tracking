txt // ( see below ) , and the work will give excellent training in practical citizenship . There should be careful discussions in all civics classes ( see below ) , elaborating the difference between the formulation of policies and the execution of these policies : the former may be done with the democratic method of discussion and majority rule ; the latter must be accomplished by direct control . After some experience in the development of student activities and student government , it will be found that those best fitted for the various groups will quite naturally reveal themselves , leadership will develop , and officers will not be hard to find . If ten or a dozen boys and girls have especially interested themselves in school publications , let us say , or stage management , the incoming president with the advice of the other elective officers may readily select the head of that department . Or , it is conceivable that the group of pupils may itself nominate its director . Combinations of departments may be made in small schools , or the elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools or colleges a dozen or twenty main departments may be needed . Each officer should make reports to the cabinet at stated periods , with suggestions for improvements in the work . Criteria for success of legislative functions . The cabinet should meet for the purpose of hearing reports and discussing the work of the officers . The charter may give to it definite responsibilities which somewhat overlap both executive and legislative functions , such as voting appropriations , paying bills , and awarding honors . The two teachers on the cabinet must be willing to express their opinions and be outvoted , and should of course have no power of veto . If any action seems so mistaken and so grave in consequences that the principal and faculty should at once know of it , the teacher member can so announce in the cabinet meeting , and ask the president to go with him to tell the principal . In other cases the students should be allowed to learn through mistakes . The cabinet will hear from each officer proposals for the // improvement or extension of his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters and use every endeavor to coordinate the work of the various activities and departments . The legislative committee ' in the plan proposed is the agency which proposes laws for student-body action . Since there are many educators who question the wisdom or the necessity for having pupils write down their standards of conduct in the form of published laws , we are under the obligation to discuss this whole problem in some detail . The argument for legislative functions . King John in England was forced to write down the fundamental laws of the country , and this event is often cited as an important gain in human development . Today , wherever people are gathered together in desire to work out cooperative relationships , mutual understandings are likely to be required , and are therefore formulated and made available . ' The romanticist says , " I agree that adult cooperation requires government by laws , but the life of the school ought to do better than that ; it should be fine enough to avoid the necessity for written rules . " This romantic statement receives its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn with some relation to the skills in citizenship which children need to learn . It is anarchism which seeks to do away with all governmental machinery . Why should we do away with or omit legislative machinery in the face of two facts : ours is a government of laws , and some of our most serious difficulties are in the domain of laws ? // Some principals and teachers use the family analogy , " We are all one big family " ; a few might appropriately add , " I am the parent and will do all the deciding . " Families are diverse in their performance even of their paternalistic beneficence , and few practice any group government , however informal . Some teachers say , " We have no rules in this school ; we are just ladies and gentlemen . " Noblesse oblige and the acceptance of social standards are excellent , and very necessary . But can they be created by mere hortatory appeal ? This approach too suggests anarchism ; of course it works in some closely knit schools which are dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It secures order , and often the appearance of friendliness , but it does not prepare for citizenship . Furthermore , whenever this plan breaks down , it at once forces dictatorship upon the teacher or principal . The words lady ' and gentleman ' do not have clear connotations , they are too little connected with action , and even when they do suggest action , there is much variation in standards . Another common cause of delay in developing legislation is the notion that " my pupils are too young to draw up laws , but next year I feel sure they will be ready to try it . " Strangely enough , this is the argument of teachers at all points along the path of education , and the emperor , the soviet , and the dictator use it of adult citizens . The contest between authority and selfgovernment is going to be a long one ; should we not early give children in the school a bit of a start in acquiring the practice , the technical knowledge , and the wisdom connected therewith ? If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize than are the executive functions , but it is fully as important ; further , with executive training and without legislation we are likely to give a twisted notion of government : the students can never see clearly the real sources of the powers they exercise . Inadequate substitutes for legislation . Law-making helps to develop cooperative standards of behavior . At present our // faculty method , or lack of method , has the following faults , in addition to those already discussed . 1 . Faculty rule neglects the truth that most breaches of conduct , such as entering rooms noisily , throwing paper about , rough play , and ill-timed conversation are due rather to thoughtlessness than to willfulness . The problem is to make the pupils think . 2 . We often choose the wrong psychological moment for the motivation of pupils ? just after the wrong act , instead of before , or at some later time when the emotion has passed . " Mean old thing , " said one girl to another when they met in the detention room , ' " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last bell . " Thinking should have come in advance of the temptation ; it was prevented directly after the act , by the emotion . 3 . Our rules are indefinite and not properly announced . " You are requested , " said the principal of a large high school to the assembly , " not to lean your bicycles against the school building . " Inattention would account for some pupils ' failure . to register this request , and on any day there were thirty or more absent . Two days later the selfgovernment committee , ' on the principal 's suggestion , piled up a large number of bicycles in the school yard , to the great annoyance and inconvenience of the boys after school , many of whom were in a hurry to keep important business engagements . What must be the thoughts of the young people to whom such unsystematic , unintelligent , and unsympathetic punishment is administered ? 4 . The obedience or loyalty we seem to get is not intelligent and selfcreated but is more often mere acquiescence because it pays better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good natured . We think we have definite ideas about smoking and behavior on the grounds and in the auditorium , but any investigation will show that we disagree among ourselves , and pupils in self-defense are forced to study the standards of each teacher separately . Examples of successful legislation . Law-making in schools is workable : it will not fail when carefully put into operation . The principal of a school of 2500 made the mistake of giving a severe scolding to the students in assembly one Monday morning because of the smoking at a football game . A new teacher in the school , decided to use a few periods in three English classes for the thorough discussion of the issues raised . Every attempt was made to let the erroneous ideas have their say , trusting that they would reveal points of view which should be taken into consideration , and that the members of the class // would find the answers . After the discussions were rounded out , the following votes were taken by secret ballot : Should pupils be allowed to leave grounds at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra playing be allowed ? No , 75 to 33 Should smoking be allowed at noon in the grounds ? No , 103 to 4 Should it be allowed at noon off the grounds ? No , 79 to 27 Should it be allowed to and from school ? No , 66 to 38 Should it be allowed Saturdays at games ? No , 71 to 36 Should it be allowed to teachers at school ? No , 97 to 9 Should it be allowed to teachers to and from school ? No , 53 to 52 Should teachers be required to refrain altogether ? No , 31 to 20 Should teachers observe substantially the same laws as do pupils ? Yes , 87 to 20 Should pupils help make the laws of the school ? Yes , 106 to 2 Should there be a girls ' committee to supervise dress ? No , 52 to 50 It must be noted , of course , that no student-government system would be allowed to legislate for teachers . The purpose in giving scope to this discussion was to test the judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things about as adults do . A study of these scores indicates that they do , and that these pupils were ready to begin assuming responsibility for legislation , as indeed they successfully demonstrated shortly thereafter . One significant discovery in these discussions was that a small group of teachers who secretly ( so they thought ) smoked at noon was a source of strong resentment in the school population . At first student laws are likely to be mere prohibitions , a logical enough situation when we study adult laws . But pupils can quickly be guided into better things . The following is a sixth-grade product in a Colorado school : We should walk in the halls and not run . We should take one step at a time on the stairs . Keep single file on the stairs . Keep quiet in the halls . Wait your turn at the drinking fountain . We should not disturb classes by looking in at the windows and doors . Let us have a cleaner school by keeping all trash out of the halls and not mark on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obey the rules . // Is not this practical idealism , and will it not be easier to discipline an offender if we can point to the vote of his fellows in support of the rule ? In a junior high school of about 800 pupils , the one of the firecracker episode mentioned above , there had been a half-hearted response to a scanty program of activities and to the idea of boy and girl judges . An interested teacher was given the opportunity to work with two discussion groups , boys and girls , ? a combined group might have been better , ? f or the purpose of drafting a code of laws . The method used may be recommended , with minor changes . After school and during certain study periods each group met for perhaps a total of five hours . Each pupil was asked to write down any proposed regulations that occurred to him . They talked over the various aspects of school life , and noted any large headings that might be used . Then they met in committees representing each topic : buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revised , and codified the suggested rules . Then each reported to the main group , and after the codes had been tentatively approved , subcommittees from the boys ' and the girls ' groups met and worked out a suggested code of 28 laws . These were mimeographed , read , and posted in all the rooms , and every effort was made to explain them . Two weeks later a secret vote was taken . Four proposed laws were lost : 4 . Anyone excused to go to the basement shall have a written excuse from his or her teacher of that period . 174 to 595. 14 . No one shall eat his lunch on the steps at noon , or sit on the steps at noon . 327 to 434 28 . No water shall be given to any pupil after the bell has sounded . 311 to 440 18 . Any person or persons drinking at fountains after the first bell rings , shall be given such time as the judge shall see fit . Time shall be doubled for second offense. 227 to 552 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had formerly been the rule by fiat of the principal , was soon restored by the pupils ' vote , on account of the large number of tardinesses the habit caused . Following are the votes on some laws adopted by this school ; it will be remarked that there were dissenters , just as there are to certain adult laws . It is possible that the negative form of the statements confused some voters . 1 . Lockers shall be kept clean . No waste paper shall be left in them . 746 to 24 8 . Pupils must not rough-house in the rooms . By rough-house is // meant whistling , boxing , leaving seats , throwing things , running , hitting with books , loud talking , loud laughing , or any other disorder . 633 to 140 12 . Boys and girls shall remain on their own sides of the yard at noon . 579 to 204 ( Many wanted coeducational play ) 13 . In order to protect the fences , climbing through or over or under them is not allowed . 510 to 247 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 25 . When pupils are summoned to fire drills , it is to be understood that they should go straight to the annex steps as fast as possible . This does not mean that there is to be running or pushing . Pupils should not and must not ditch fire drills , nor stop to put away books , nor get drinks , nor in any other way delay them . 716 to 53. 26 . Anyone using rouge , eye-brow pencil , or paint will be reported . 597 to 269 . ( This was several years ago ! Perhaps only girls should have voted on such a question. ) 27 . Fighting between pupils of the school is prohibited by the laws governing the student body . 553 to 217 . The same story of trustworthy selection is revealed by the scores on 27 proposed laws voted on by a group of high school pupils . For some reason a three-fourths vote was required and only 18 were made laws . None of the nine rejected are important enough to disturb the equanimity of an adult . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation . If some such conference method as that outlined above is used in starting a plan of legislation , the meetings should be continued for a few months , under the guidance of a teacher , to suggest corrections in the code , as mistakes are discovered , and to propose other desirable rules . Students are apt to make the laws too many and too severe , and on occasion to aim the laws at persons rather than evils . Careful guidance should accompany any wholesale task such as the beginning of legislation involves . Some schools pass laws by the committee or council , and do not allow all the students to vote except in case of the initiative or referendum ; there are arguments in favor of either plan . Under that herein described the initiative may be used to propose laws not included by the legislative committee . // A brief statement of certain city , state , and federal laws relating to children and rules of the board of education may be prepared and incorporated into the school code . Following are a few such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . Pupils shall be held accountable for their conduct on the way to and from school , on the playgrounds , or during recess . 2 . It is unlawful to haze any pupil , or to commit any act that injures , degrades , or disgraces any fellow student . 5 . Pupils shall not go to school without proper attention having been given to personal cleanliness , or neatness of dress . 7 . Each pupil shall keel ) his desk and the floor beneath in a neat and orderly condition . 9 . Textbooks must not be injured . Of course none of these should be voted upon ; it will be a wholesome thing for children to realize that these laws already exist , and that their own laws merely proceed farther in the same direction . Every student-made law should go out of effect every 18 months or two years , and should be brought forward again in advance of that time , for study , discussion , and voting . This provision for the renewal of the laws is designed to prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous school generation . Recording the laws and other documents . The director of records will have an important task in keeping carefully a list of all the laws , and other documents of the school , and in classifying them and having them available for inspection . In addition to the historical data , which he should safeguard and keep up to date ( including the athletic records of the school ) , he should have the following kinds of legal documents . STUDENT-GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS 1 . CHARTER : the fundamental document . It should describe the chief features of the government , its officers , main divisions , and departments . It should describe in broad outlines how by-laws and ordinary laws are made . It should explain the process of amending the charter , which includes approval by the faculty . 2 . BY-LAws : the details of the government 's organization . Bylaws should give in detail the methods by which the provisions of the // charter are carried out . They should include a list of the major and minor organizations ; rules for athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; rules of procedure of the cabinet , legislative committee , and judicial committee ; election rules ; and the major regulations for the financial control of student affairs . 3 . LAWS OF THE SCHOOL VOTED BY STUDENTS . 4 . LAWS OF THE SCHOOL VOTED BY THE FACULTY . 5 . CHARTERS OR CONSTITUTIONS OF ALL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS . 6 . RULES OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE . ' The effect of legislation on school morale . If earlier discussions have seemed to emphasize the argument that student government will help to prepare for adult citizenship , it may now be appropriate to state some of the immediate benefits to the students . We have maintained that laws or rules made by the faculty and enforced by the faculty may be characterized as autocracy ; and that laws made by the faculty and enforced by the students may easily become a scheme for persuading them to undertake unpleasant tasks that we ought to do ourselves . The plan by which the students make the laws and the teachers enforce them has many advantages , especially when the participation in government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because penalties and punishments now have the backing of recorded student opinion . Finally , of all the four alternatives , student laws enforced by students seem best of all , because in that form the administration of justice is in full partnership with the legislative function . The following advantages of such a legislative opportunity may be noted . ADVANTAGES OF LEGISLATION TO STUDENT MORALE 1 . All the students know that they may freely discuss school rules and help to change them . The teachers likewise are free to give their opinions , without the constraint of the older relationship . 2 . Almost universally the pupils will gladly obey the definitely expressed standards of the majority of their fellows , and more willingly take the penalty for disobedience . // 3 . Every law that is clearly good , will have a large majority supporting it : an impressive deterrent to violations , and a bulwark to good public opinion . 4 . The plan will develop a new school loyalty and sense of responsibility . 5 . The school will gradually change its tone , becoming cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or imperialistic. 6 . The legislative practice will involve many experiences useful in the present life and education of the children : laws not known by those who violate them , laws too hurriedly passed , laws too complex , too simple , not obeyed , not intended to he obeyed , too many laws , overlapping , indifference , acquiescence in the wishes of politicians . Under guidance the pupils can learn how to correct or eliminate these conditions . 7 . Pupils themselves will see that they are achieving the transition from childhood to a fuller citizenship . 8 . Pupils are forced to think upon standards of conduct . One of the most difficult elements in American life is the problem of political parties ; that extraconstitutional machinery through which we operate our constitution . ( The makers of our federal constitution did not have any thought that parties would arise . ) School government should help in suggesting party issues comparable to those in adult life : centralization and decentralization , liberalism and conservatism , and small and large loyalties . Fixed party lines in voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself aligned now with one group and again with another . And the teachers should watch for the emergence of reasonable tendencies towards radicalism and conservatism , encouraging them and recommending also the consideration of the other side . ' // Criteria for success of the judicial functions . Skill in enforcing the laws and in judging offenses is almost as difficult as legislation , but is no less necessary for the purposes of education in and for citizenship . The plan must include a method of discovering instances of law infraction , and of correcting them by re-forming the thought of the individuals needing guidance . If the students are willing to pass a law without a corresponding willingness to have it enforced they seem to be unready to undertake government . Every effort must be made to avoid the encouragement of spying , spite , or officiousness . It will never be necessary to ask everybody to watch for violations . Nevertheless , whenever faced with manifest law-breaking , citizens ought to give warnings or to make it known . Under normal circumstances the members of the traffic department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , and they will have the special business of taking whatever steps are necessary to have the regulations obeyed . Complaints may be handed in by anyone connected with the school , or even by outsiders . They should be signed , but the // person reporting should be protected in his complaint and the hearing need not usually disclose his name . There should be severe punishment in the case of a deliberately false complaint , but this almost never happens in adult life , and will very seldom occur in school . Hearings should be informal and undramatic . If two of the members of the judicial committee request a separate session of boys or girls , the case in hand may then be referred to such a hearing . Some schools and most colleges prefer two committees , one for boys and the other for girls . The questions asked by the chairman should be simple and informal : " What was it you did ? How ( lid you happen to do it ? What reminder do you need ? " The settlement of cases should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually it is not at all necessary for the principal or faculty to know the details . There should be a sponsor for the committee , but he should very seldom attend the meetings after assuring himself that the work is being well done . One adviser in a school where a judge is chairman of the committee writes : " The intention of the judge is to discover the reasons why the offense was committed , and to attempt to show in a friendly way that an anti-social attitude is an undesirable one , both for the group and for the individual . " Punishments give the hardest problem . The detention room is a crude and unsatisfactory method . Deprivation of certain privileges is sometimes useful . Extra work of one kind and another may be tried , but it has the decided disadvantage of associating work with punishment . Just now the merit and demerit system seems to be in favor . Each student begins the semester with 100 merit credits . He may add to this score by public service , and he subtracts from it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a distinct influence with many pupils as a preventive . They dislike having a report on their card showing that they have lost merits , and still more do they dislike having a permanent // record of demerits against them . We have a Merit Board consisting of four students and three faculty members which reviews the more serious cases . This board has had considerable influence with such derelicts , largely because the student president points out to the offender in a friendly way the necessity and desirability of cooperation among all the students . There is some evidence that younger children , used to the old ways of discipline , respond well to detention , and that the merit plan works better with the older . Students are much inclined to make punishments too severe at first ; first offenses will rarely need more than a talking over , and serious and continued offenses will be limited to a very few students . Chronic offenders may be sent to the special room for the old type one-teacher method , advocated for educational guidance ( p. 166 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may need the help of a mental hygienist . Enough has already been said to constitute a condemnation of the so-called honor system . ' If this is based solely on personal honor , there is no machinery to handle violations and one person can upset the scheme . Such a plan is educationally of little value if it succeeds , and dangerously harmful if it fails . Curiously enough , the honor system is usually applied to the one event which the teachers plan without the consent or active cooperation of the students ? examinations . Short of actual revocation of the charter , or of parts of it , the teachers may pass and enforce such laws as they think so important that the faculty can not wait for student action nor brook student reluctance . But as a courtesy to the juvenile government such laws should require a two-thirds vote of the faculty , and of course the students should not be asked to enforce them . An appraisal of the results of student government . It would be impossible to list all the results of student government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few sample events , perhaps not wholly the result of the plan , but we think influenced directly by it . // 1 . A school janitor , tired of the conditions in the boys ' washroom of the kindergarten , called together a committee of the boys with whom he talked over his desire for improvement . They agreed to keep the room in order , and proposed appropriate standards . They proceeded at once to tell the rest of the boys , and supervised the carrying out of the ' regulations . The janitor invited a visitor to enter the room and throw a piece of paper on the floor to see what would happen , but he refused to try this experimental law breaking . 2 . On a snowy day in New York City three teachers of an elementary school were absent , but not till nearly noon ( lid the principal take any notice of it . In each class the pupil leader was busily teaching the regular lessons , and the spirit was excellent . 3 . A high school of 100 pupils voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education paying the money to the student treasurer . The funds were used for extended trips to study civic and educational institutions . After two or three years a change of heating system made it necessary to hire a licensed janitor ; up to that time the work was done better by the students than it had ever been done before . Student committees so planned the work that every boy and girl had a diversified experience . 4 . In the four successive self-government ' camps , each consisting of about 75 boys 10 to 18 years of age , the cigarette problem was completely non-existent , the camp was never troubled by night disturbances , only one fight was started ( and this was stopped at once by other boys ) , and there were almost no violations of the camp boundary rules . The common method of helpfulness was a friendly warning , " You 're breaking a law , " and this was often given by the youngest members to the oldest with uniformly prompt results . 5 . A high school adviser ' testifies as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wise a discussion from students over a case of discipline as I have ever heard among teachers . Our court of justice deals with cases of discipline entirely by vote of the students after the faculty adviser has presented her view . We have never had cause to veto the action of the court nor has any student ever expressed the feeling that he was punished too severely . 6 . One of the most important and difficult matters of adult citizenship is the raising , budgeting , and appropriating of money . One high school student body in Los Angeles voted $16,000 from the treasury , derived chiefly from lunchroom , entertainments , athletics , and the school paper , and then raised $6000 more in a two weeks ' drive , to purchase two acres of land next to the school grounds , as a site for a // memorial park to schoolmates who lost their lives in the war . The same school presented the retiring principal with the funds for a trip around the world . Another high school purchased four linotype machines for the printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial sum of money to rehabilitate a number of graduates who as students at the state university lost their effects in a fire . Pasadena High School and Junior College ( and doubtless many others ) has a generous scholarship fund maintained by student funds . Another did the artistic , financial , and pick-and-shovel ' work in an extensive plan for the beautification of the school grounds . 7 . At one Los Angeles high school the faculty all took a visiting day , and the student-government officials , with the help of an elected leader for every recitation , managed the work of the school . An assembly period was held , and a fire drill . Over 1000 students took their regular physical training , and the expensive machinery of the shops was used as on any other day , with none but students in charge . Only by comparing notes during the morning did the students discover that all the teachers were absent ; the principal had informed only a few of the higher officers . The superintendent of schools called during the afternoon , and stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in St. - Louis excused its teachers for a three-day educational convention , all classes being carried on by pupils . 8 . In many high schools girls have taken over the problems of dress and manners , and have accomplished much good . College girls have gone far in working out standards and administering them . 9 . At the University of California at Berkeley the senior control ' of discipline , organized by Benjamin Ide Wheeler , has a record of success reaching back many years . It is the consensus of opinion at the university that no faculty officers or committees could do as well as have these students with the problems of behavior of several thousand undergraduates . While the details of the system need not be copied , particularly the limitation to seniors , it furnishes a notable contribution to the progress of student citizenship . Participation of college students in cooperative control is important because of the fact that their fellows of corresponding age who are in labor unions are taking part in organized life , and are likely to secure advantages in practical experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it be confined to that ? of the college graduate . Obviously the state needs the constructive contribution of both groups . 10 . Teachers learn much from trying to teach democratic methods to students . By losing the prerogative to discipline students on sight , and the habit of exercising that prerogative , they gain new and more friendly relationships with students . Mutual understanding is proGUIDANCE // moted and conversations with teachers become less charged with excitement and apprehensiveness . The busybody is successfully deterred . In one school a teacher resigned after finding that his charges against students had no effect : he evidently realized finally that his troubles were based largely on his own temper . A very few teachers will long sit in the seat of the scornful , and they should be given scope to state their views in faculty meetings ; good should come to them and the school from discussion , and no good can come from trying to silence them . To almost all teachers in a school wisely committed to student participation , there comes a new view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the work is made easier , since no educational tasks are easy to do well . But the results are decidedly more satisfactory : ( 1 ) the teacher is relieved of much of the pettiness of life that rightly distresses an intelligent and high minded person ; ( 2 ) he is able to turn wholeheartedly and without interference to the real tasks of education ; and ( 3 ) he is able to see rather immediate results in the citizenship growth and activities of students instead of having to work in the dark for an uncertain outcome . 11 . Student government develops an attitude of mind that results in a supply of available leaders whenever needed . In the summer camp already mentioned , a new election was held in the middle of the period . Over half of those elected had never held office before and most of the others were in new positions . The usual experience is that it takes from two to four weeks for the new officers to gain their stride , ' but the reorganized camp seemed to proceed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it . Again , a high school class in oral English , in a school with a strong government , was allowed the four final periods for a mock trial , as a reward for good work throughout the term . The twenty or more students were well acquainted with every member 's ability in speaking , for they had had their own officers and critics ; therefore , they naturally selected the best members for the parts in the trial . This left about half the class as spectators , until it was found that there was a vacant room nearby and it was suggested that the left-overs organize another mock trial . This was done , and the performance of the second group was even better than that of the first . The diffusion among the large mass of students of civic habits and attitudes seems to furnish a fertile soil for the growth of leadership , and a good plan of student-government will accomplish this diffusion . Some objections to and difficulties with student participation . School authorities who are unwilling to encounter the risks of guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing their pupils to learn self-government , if at all , outside the influence of the school . Those who are willing to change toward student control , no matter how slowly , should study the abuses which sometimes occur and the objections commonly urged . There need never be a sudden turning to student control ; contrary to the opinions of the romanticists , in this field there is middle ground between despotism and an adequate plan such as we have described , though that ground , if the student responses are good , should properly not be a standing place , but a path to greater participation . Following are a few of the mistakes commonly made in student participation , and the objections commonly voiced , with brief suggestions on how each may be handled . 1 . Sometimes students grow violent and unreasonable . A high school paper led a successful campaign for radical changes in the plan of government . Its start was calculated to test the nerves of the faculty : Once more the semi-annual farce of electing members of the Council and the Self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We again take up the old joke of pretending that we have STUDENT GOVERNMENT . This seems the psychological moment for the Weekly to propound a few questions that have been harassing the Editorial mind for some time . There are several things we want to know , and we are so anxious to find them out that we are willing to risk precipitating a revolution in order to get something started . . . . How is it that , the supposedly PROGRESSIVE school , should have such a mere shell of a government ? ? How is it that motions which have been killed by the Council , which is supposedly the governing body of the school , have later been passed by some power higher up ? ? ? . . . Why is it that every student manager has at least three members of the Faculty camping on his trail ? ? . . . How when a man has pleaded NoT GUILTY , he is tried before a jury of SELF GOVERNMENT OFFICERS ? Why are not the juries down town made up of POLICEMEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS STUDENT GOVERNMENT . We do n't think so and have a better one , which we will submit to you at a later issue . In the meantime , write out your views on // the subject , and hand them to us . We want to know if you are interested . Fortunately , the faculty and the principal neither objected to these articles nor made light of them . If the beginning was somewhat arrogant the end was much more dignified , and all the students of this school had a new demonstration of the fact that thinking and criticism were allowed . 2 . A former state superintendent of public instruction ( California ) a few years ago wrote thus about abuses in student government : The principle of student-government has been stretched in some instances to cover educational anarchy . Witness boys and girls declaring openly and with parental approval that the faculty of the school have no business attempting to regulate in any way the financial and social activities of the student body . Witness a group of nine boys publishing over their signatures an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending because they were forbidden to play a ball game as a school team on account of an infraction of the rules . Witness another group using the school paper to attack the school board because the board had the temerity to elect a principal whom the pupils did not know , instead of another man whom the pupils preferred . Witness another group denying the right of the faculty to interfere with the employment of an athletic coach with whom no father would knowingly allow his son to associate . But worse still , witness a school board sitting to hear the case of pupils who had been suspended for cause , and ignoring the entire faculty , telling teachers in the presence of the offending pupils to sit down and be quiet . Specific schools will not be mentioned , but each and every one of these things has occurred in California high schools in the last two years . . . . No school worthy of the name can exist unless the principle of respect for authority is observed . No school can exist without discipline , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school means anarchy in the nation later on . The things most needed in America today are more iron in the blood and more stiffness of the backbone . Some of our school boards and faculties should begin to develop both by insisting that the first civic duty of an American youth is to learn to respect legally constituted authority . And a second civic duty is to learn the difference between liberty and license . In arguing for student government one does not need to defend such events as these described . But one may make several pertinent comments : ( 1 ) lively quarrels between students and faculties are not confined to student-government schools ; ( 2 ) such quarrels are often in268 EDUCATION AS GUIDANCE stigated by adults ; ( 3 ) pupils often gain ideas and examples for such quarrels from the civic life of adult citizens ; ( 4 ) teachers are often indirectly to blame for such situations , because they do not thoroughly inform pupils and adult citizens about their purposes and rulings ; ( 5 ) doubtless most of the abuses cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan 1 of student government used . If pupils make mistakes in this difficult problem of organized cooperation , the remedy is a painstaking attempt to give them more and better guidance in citizenship . 3 . Failure to safeguard the charter idea leads to many abuses , and thus to objections to the plans . A recent excellent plea not to be afraid to allow pupils to make and correct errors tells of an organized transaction by which a group of senior boys persuaded the school to vote away the constitutional sic right of faculty veto . ' The results were not so bad as some teachers predicted , and much was learned by all concerned . Nothing was gained by the event chronicled in the newspaper in capital headlines " Teachers Quit in High School Student Row , " nor by the later confession of defeat , " Henceforth all editorials which cast reflection on the faculty or student body must first be passed on by the principal . " There are so many positive ways of learning through right forms of guidance that the extreme negative ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution under which the students could run away with the government ' perhaps the faculty had better get along without suggesting the change to a charter : such a suggestion might stir up trouble . ( It is a pity that school people know so little about government : but of course they learned about it only from books , and books all glorify our federal constitution , which , by the way , is a highly peculiar kind of combined charter-constitution , decidedly not to be imitated by a school. ) 4 . Some mistakes and abuses enter because students are not taught how to delegate authority . Every high officer should be taught how he may appropriately give detailed duties to others and thus free himself for such supervisory activities as inspecting , overseeing , and conferring . 5 . Abuses always enter when governmental powers are given too soon . An enthusiastic beginner tried to introduce group government into a summer playground , but soon found that it was merely a kind of legalized favoritism and bullying . Many school people say that they have tried student government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be supplied , or apathy described . But inquiry will usually show that capital mistakes were made in introducing or carry- // ing out the plan . An ignorant people can not succeed in self-government . 6 . The abuses of bad politics , bargaining , favoritism , etc. , are sometimes found in fairly good systems . The trouble lies usually in lack of guidance . Hectic campaigns are a rnistake . Student control should not soon be applied , if ever , to those three activities in which teachers are most concerned : keeping attendance , homework , and examinations . Student officers often give excused slips ' to their friends who are tardy , the trouble being that the stage is set for temptation . If officers tend to appoint their friends to office , at the least make them see that they should hold such persons especially responsible for results , not protecting them in cases of inefficiency . 7 . It is said that " only a few leaders benefit through student government . " But how many will benefit without it ? The improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on too few student leaders . Indifferent pupils should be encouraged and guided to take part . 8 . " Student government causes officers to lose the friendships of their fellows . " This may happen at the beginning , when the pupils do not know the responsibilities of officers ; the problem should be thoroughly discussed in the civics classes . 9 . " It develops the detective habit of mind ? of looking for trouble . " Some teachers also may have this habit . Both students and teachers who suffer in this way should be guided into a happier attitude . Right forms of government do not foster such a habit . 10 . " It lessens respect for teachers . " Not unless teachers wish the wrong kind of respect . 11 . " Students can not really govern wisely . " On the contrary , it can be shown that they show remarkable wisdom . After a few years ' experience and guidance they will have a government which will compare very favorably with that of any town or city government which can be named . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much on account of lack of good leaders and officers . " These ups and downs are an excellent problem to have students meet and try to solve . City governments do the sarne. 13 . " It enables poor students and bad boys to gain control . " If this seems to be a problem , the faculty , under the charter , can present a list of eligible students from which officers may be elected . Under good guidance the boys and girls will select the best . 14 . " Girls are often left out ; the boys hold the important offices . " This is likely to be a serious difficulty , but it exists also in adult government . Witness a recent magazine article specifying how the leaders // of the two parties have persistently avoided giving women any real partnership in party councils . Since women have a fight to make in political life , which is the better policy ? to organize girls separately for the purpose of giving many of them practice , or to associate them with boys at the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls as a subsidiary organization under the charter ; this still leaves them in the main student body as well . Wise guidance of the girls is much needed in the high school , and it seems clear that some part of this guidance should include association in serving with boys ; even the woman politician practiced in women 's colleges and women 's clubs may be helpless in the face of the masculine methods and traditions of Tammany or the 15 . " Student government interferes with studies . " Sometimes a scholarly boy fritters his time away in student activities which teach him nothing that he does not already know , or in government positions merely to satisfy a desire for power . Careful guidance is needed lest a student indulge a mistaken interest and throw away his chance for education . If a given student can serve well in a high office , this may in reality be a good reason why he does not need that experience . There is always the argument that one should serve his fellows in school as in life , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an educational institution . On the other side , however , mere academic scholarship must not be rated higher than learning good citizenship . 16 . " The laws can never be adequate to cover every trouble , for the simple reason that clever boys will think up new things to do . " Laws stated in general terms can obviate this trouble , such as any other disorder , ' or any act that in the opinion of the committee casts , reflection on the good name of the school . ' 17 . " It hampers the school authorities . " Student government is sometimes objected to by a school principal on the ground that the head of the school should not be bound by rules , ? he ought to have the opportunity to decide every case on its merits . ' This seems to mean that he is unwilling to have anybody know in advance how he is likely to decide ; this attitude will interfere with any cooperative enterprise . The policy of deciding cases on the moment , with no guiding principles , is fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should be afraid of policies understood in advance . This does not mean that penalties should be specified ; they should not . Of course , however , if in any specific case the principal or counselor has confidential information which he can not divulge to the students , he can so state and they will respect his decision on that basis . 18 . It is sometimes said that student government is possible only in a school which does not need it . This statement reveals misconcepGUIDANCE // tions . Democracy is not a disagreeable medicine to be taken as a last resort when all other things fail : it is a desirable goal to be won and preserved and used as something resembling more nearly than any other form of human government the brotherhood of man . 19 . " It is easy to devise a plan to have Henry govern John , but harder to teach John to govern John . " Doubtless , but if both participate in working out the standards of conduct , will not individual selfgovernment be facilitated ? It is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws they help to make . With standards cooperatively and definitely worked out , at the very least Henry can remind John more happily than he can with no definite standards at all . 20 . " Student government savors of bolshevism . " No one has advocated self-government ' for students , though that expression has often been used and misunderstood . The right kind of participation through a charter is wholly unlike bolshevism in form and spirit . 21 . " There is apt to be an undercurrent of lawlessness accompanying student government . " This criticism too is based no doubt on the many counterfeits of student government , rather than on the good plans . This undercurrent is more characteristic of the typical school with no student government than of any other . 22 . " It is unnecessary for pupils to learn all these things ; very few of them will have anything to do with making laws or the administration of justice . " This is a cynical view of adult democracy , but unjustified . We have referendums , and the election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hundreds of industrial and commercial establishments which have participation plans , and cooperative government under various semi-civic forms are common in churches , unions , professional organizations , parents ' associations , clubs , fraternities , and neighborhood affairs . In all of these legislation is practiced , and often the administration of justice . Furthermore , there is every reason ( and great need ) for a far larger number of citizens participating actively in political and governmental processes . 23 . " Student government teaches false and petty loyalties . " If teachers will study the loyalties of students , they will be in a position to make marked progress in improving them . Loyalty to friend , secret agreement , evil doing , silliness , selfishness , organized error , ? these curse the lives of unguided young people . Having nothing stimulating them to a big love or loyalty , they fasten their admiration and affection upon unworthy objects and ends . The college fraternity and the illegal high school secret club , are defended by some on the ground that the young person needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger one . This is probably a misapprehension ; there // seems to be no difficulty whatever in turning the thoughts of children to the most idealistic and spiritual loyalties , if an honest attempt is made . Student government is fully as deserving the loyalty of young people as city , state , and nation are that of their fathers and mothers . It is the pupils ' expression of brotherhood . Special applications of participation plans . Clearly the youngest children need the simplest forms . They will have a childlike trust in reasonable regulations made by teachers , but they like to talk over standards nevertheless . Kindergartens have committees to feed the pets , care for the toys , give out the work , and other such tasks , and they do well in planning , executing , and reporting . They are especially good at reminding each other of their duties , without priggishness . The teachers of young children in the grades up to the junior high school do well to set up score cards and check lists to have them mark off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest children should more of ten be appointed than elected . This is not because of lack of years , by itself ; it is because the art of cooperation is difficult to learn , requiring extensive experience . In the elementary school of six grades , the teachers will have to depend most on the two or three upper grades . Doubtless these pupils should often meet alone for discussion of school affairs . Some school plans require fourth or fifth grade status for full voting citizenship . There are some evidences that a three-year span is an excellent period for schools and colleges , particularly for student activities and student government . The sixth-grade graduate has been in the top class , but now begins to learn the humility and teachableness of a first-year student in the junior high school . Having learned these good lessons , he finds himself in the middle year , with opportunity to take a genuine part in the activities and government , without taking much responsibility . In the third year he becomes a senior again , once more assuming leadership and responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The four-year plan , whether for // school or college , gives two middle years , which are responsible for some subtile disadvantages not yet fully analyzed . The six-year high school has many successful exemplifications throughout the United States , some of them in the largest cities . In such schools it is especially important to protect the junior division : they should have separate games , debating , musical organizations , and the like , and probably there should be two separate charters , with perhaps a coordinating commission or grand charter ' to work out the interactions between the two . Such schools as the continuation school and the evening school are relatively difficult to organize . The former is apt to be five or ten separate schools , yet in some places excellent evening meetings are provided , and sometimes Saturday afternoon and evening gatherings for enlightenment and recreation . Such meetings furnish excellent opportunity for organizing and developing student government : continuation school pupils are in desperate need of guidance in citizenship . College students need guidance in their government ; it is too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturity they can be left alone to work out their plans . Such is not the case . Most college students at present have never had practice in government , and they tend to make almost as many mistakes as the younger . Furthermore , since ' the civics classes we shall describe below are less likely to be held for college students , there is great need for those forms of counsel which will make clear the lessons which can be applied to adult government . This counsel is the more necessary , because these individuals are going to be looked up to as educated people , and called upon for various forms of civic service . Student government is often applied to playgrounds , camps , boys ' and girls ' clubs , achievement clubs , settlements , and Sunday schools , and sometimes even in homes . Resourcefulness is always valuable in making such special applications . But the need everywhere is great , and education is very much in need , just now , and always , of more persons willing to pioneer in // good causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " and more ready to ask , " Is this the right thing to do ? " 1 The history and implications of student participation . The history of student government has never been written ; the exact beginnings are probably lost in unrecorded experiences . Wilson L. Gill began his school city ' in New York City in 1897 and published his first book three years later . William R. George began the junior republic ' idea in 1895 . The former undoubtedly wished to teach civic forms and to prepare for present and adult citizenship ; the latter organized his plan with the reformation of his boys and girls in mind . William R. Ward and Myron T. Scudder of New Paltz followed Gill 's method but tried several other forms and believed in occasional changes of method and in dramatizing government . John T. Ray of Chicago used tribunes , ' but developed an excellent plan for an elementary school . Jane Brownlee of Toledo developed a plan of character teaching through government activities combined with classroom discussions . Bernard Cronson of New York worked out an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charters granted to separate rooms . J. H. Francis was the pioneer in Los Angeles , and coordinated an elaborate system of student activities with an effective plan of government . He used committees for handling discipline , but no written laws . W. W. Tritt of Los Angeles early worked out a simple and effective plan for the elementary school and later for the junior high school . 2 // There are two important implications in student participation that we do not wish to avoid : first , that our adult governments are and should be subject to the criticisms of the young ; and second , that teacher participation in school government is also worth thinking about and achieving . Criticism by the on-coming generation is important because our federal constitution may still he subject to the general revision of a convention . Made for thirteen colonies along the Atlantic seaboard , by men who got word from Boston to New York in two days , and from Europe to Philadelphia in five weeks , it has already had an embarrassing number of amendments , and more are needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chicago poster announced that the Constitution was to be thought of in the same class with the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount ; such thinking shows the need for education . Young people who participate intelligently in school government will be more likely to raise questions than will children trained in the civics classes of schools whose teachers and textbooks are approved by all the powers that merely defend the status quo . This , by some adults , will certainly be called a disadvantage of student participation in government . The profession of education needs men and women who will try to see clearly what is right to be done and will be unafraid of the future , trusting that it will be in safe hands if the coming generations are really educated . Again , it may be agreed that the principal who favors student participation can hardly deny teacher participation . The teachers are not likely to enjoy standing aside and seeing the principal in confidential conferences with students , and taking their advice in important matters , without consulting his faculty except to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a memorable occasion when the principal , in great impatience because his plan for enrolling new students was opposed by a few of the teachers , said , " Well , how many of you would like to adopt the other plan ? " ? the first vote ever taken in a faculty meeting of that school . // The class in citizenship . We have specified ( Ch. 4 ) three chief elements in a program of guidance : skilled activity , technical knowledge , and wisdom ; and three chief agencies : samples , classes , and individual counsel . It will be seen that our over-long treatment of student activities and government is concerned chiefly with the element skill , and with the agency samples . We have now to discuss the other elements and agencies , but fortunately we can make relatively short work of them . Theory and practice must never be separated , and in the field of citizenship their amalgamation is easy , once student government is posited . The activities connected with student government will develop skill in the items listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the corresponding items of technical knowledge and wisdom . The wisdom factor will often come directly out of good action , sometimes out . of individual counsel , and again through class discussions . Page one of a civics textbook should remind the pupils that they are now carrying on the duties of a citizen . Then the pupil-citizenship idea should he developed , the book and the syllabus furnishing orientation towards the cooperative relationships within the school , explaining and interpreting the idea of agreement and control in terms which make pupils actors instead of spectators . At about the same time the broader concept of the brotherhood of man should be exploited . Students are absorbingly interested in man 's age-old attempt to learn how to get along with his fellows . They can see that the idea of peace and war is nothing but an outward reflection of the struggle in each person 's thought to love not hate his fellow man . " What forces exist to build up good will in the world ? What seems to oppose or undermine good will ? Are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within each of us ? " Too much time should not be given to these highly philosophical problems , but they can not be ignored without great loss to the work . ' // Next should come , by means of printed or mimeographed material supplementing the textbook , a systematic study of the school 's organization and laws . The teacher will have to decide at this point how far he will go into a teaching of city , state , and federal laws : there is an excellent opportunity to discover regulations in outside life analogous to those within the school . There is great need for teaching the common laws to young people , but it is not to the credit either of the legal or teaching profession that printed statements , simple and comprehensive , seem not to be available . " Advertise the law " was the recent plea of a public man ? this should be done in the citizenship class . If the method of free discussion is used , several weeks of the class time will be consumed in what we have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juvenile forms of citizenship , outside the influence of the school , with care not to stress here their recreational , but rather their civic features . The scouting organizations state that their work has a civic effect : the pupils may bring in the literature , study the oath and the scout law , and discuss implications for successful school and adult citizenship . Boys and girls , if given a carefully prepared outline ( see p. 235 for hints ) , will furnish excellent analyses and evaluations . Boys ' clubs enroll many ; what do they do for citizenship ? The pupils should survey the forms of organized control as manifested in agricultural and achievement clubs , church organizations , and camps . The case method should be used extensively . The step from juvenile to adult organizations should be made naturally . There are civic forms of control in improvement societies , neighborhood groups , parent-teachers ' organizations , and civic hearings of various kinds , concerning all of which the pupils will already know . A bit of hard thinking is appropriate in discussing why some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal , and compulsory . The city of Dallas renders an important service to school students and // citizens , through its Civic Federation , which publishes annually a directory of agencies for civic and social progress . ' High school classes in civics might serve the city by preparing such a directory . High school and college students should also take an active part in certain of these social service organizations . Perhaps next , if not already taught in close relation to school government , should come a systematic study of city , county , state , and federal government . Omit the details that are not vital to an understanding of the spirit and the main problems of these governments ; machinery will change , and it can be learned without difficulty when needed . Foreign and international relationships and organizations will of course become of greater and greater importance to the on-coming generation . Comparisons in city government are especially interesting , and here the encyclopedias will supplement the textbooks . Certain English and German cities are valuable for such a study . The old question about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debated . The League of Nations is a governmental agency concerning which American children should not remain ignorant . The organization is extremely simple , the Assembly being the body of representatives of the nations , meeting annually ; the Council the executive committee meeting quarterly and on call ; and the Secretariat the permanent staff of experts gathering information . Students and teachers should understand the spirit of the Secretariat , that body of good will at Geneva which investigates every possible source of annoyance and throws light on every war cloud in an effort to dissipate it . Creditable authority has it that no less than seven wars were prevented by the League during its first seven years . ( A silly comment was made by an American : that these were only little wars in the Balkans ! ) Study of the League need not involve the question of our relation to it , though classes may wish to debate that question . ' // The World Court and the International Labor Office , also created by the peace treaty , are relatively independent of the League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident in any comprehensive discussion . Somewhere in the civics courses the problem of sources of information should be studied . Students should be encouraged to select a given citizenship question of current interest , and to bring to class and compare and evaluate all possible items of enlightenment : statements of facts , news articles , editorials , interpretative articles , letters , speeches , radio talks , campaign documents , controversial material . Attention may be given to the fundamental topics of adult citizenship , including those at the beginning of Chapter 8 , if and when the students seem ready for them . Crime control , war and peace , government ownership , prohibition enforcement , elections , taxation , legislation , justice ? all the hundreds of issues which go to make up our problem of citizenship ? may be drawn into the class discussions . Purely descriptive matter should be minimized except as it is necessary to get the fact basis for discussion ; why waste time talking about the things all agree upon , or giving explanations on how to fold the ballot ? Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agencies which wish to influence or gain control of the schools for their own purposes , whether to promote the drinkmore-milk campaign or to encourage thrift . Such proposals should never he allowed to address themselves directly to the pupils ; they should be required to present their ideas for new subject matter to committees of teachers , and these teachers , in cooperation with the superintendent , should decide what , should go into the citizenship lessons . Finally , while our outline of subject matter for the class in citizenship is admittedly sketchy , is it not full enough to indicate the necessity of sticking to citizenship in the narrow sense , and not trying in the civics class to teach how to be good men and women in all the manifold activities of life ? Is it not clear that if civics teachers try to cover home membership and vocational // guidance and health little time will be left for grappling head-on with the enormously important problems of government ? Why should civics teachers set themselves the impossible task of covering all of organized , cooperative life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils for governmental cooperation ? Methods of the civics class . Teachers of citizenship should freely make use of the classroom methods explained in Chapter 4 , with much emphasis on socialized plans . Recitations must not be spent on the reproduction of subject matter , but on the discussion of its validity , trustworthiness , wisdom , implications , and ? especially ? applications . In the discussion of controversial questions there are several important precautions . State and local teachers ' associations should understand something of the content of these classes , and should give their support to this subject matter through resolutions or approval of syllabuses . Instructors of the neverquestioned subjects must stand ready to defend those who are on the firing line of progress . In the classroom it is important to remember that everything must be said and done with due regard to the conventions . The public and its officials are unfortunately far more disturbed by unconventionality than by error . Again , in any discussion , there must be opportunity to hear both sides , nor must there be the slightest hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period does not leave the discussion at too tense a place : if necessary he should interrupt to cool off the debate or raise it to a higher level . It is better to make sure that the pupils see the problem as a problem than that they try to arrive at a solution . To this end he had best ask questions to bring out new aspects , and not make speeches on one or both sides of the question . Teachers can not successfully conceal their views on important questions , and need not try . They should remember that they are engaged to further education and enlightenment , and not to persuade pupils to a given attitude or practice . Let the teacher be free // to take part in politics if he wishes ; but if he is truly devoted to the cause of education more than to any other social cause , he will act upon the belief that we have not yet found the answers to these many difficult questions ? there is no panacea ? we need more light . Thus he advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or socialism . Students must be taught to listen , and to be fair . They must be warned to be careful how they talk over these things to persons who may misunderstand , and taught something of 1 he university attitude of free debate in the class , with no reporters present . Principals and parents must remember that pupils often misquote . Teachers must never ask a principal in advance , " Do n't you think we had better take up the city election in my civics class ? " for no principal can intelligently answer either yes or no to such a question . The citizenship classes on the various levels may proceed in a cycle or spiral , each class repeating on a higher level the discussion of important skills and attitudes that need learning and relearning . Counselors and sponsors for citizenship . Practice and class discussions must be supplemented by individual counseling . In the field of student activities and government , counseling often takes the form of having faculty advisers or sponsors for the various clubs and other activities . Thus in serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debating coach , and last as faculty delegate to the Associated Student Body Association , ' one teacher was contributing to the student control of the first two , and giving citizenship counsel in the last . There is no need for standardization either of terminology or of function , so long as we derive genuine educational value from our work as sponsors . The advisers , coaches , sponsors , or counselors , should cooperate with civics teachers and counselors to put baseball and debating into their appropriate place in the school 's organized life , and to help the pupils work out effective legal control of them . We do not propose to list the several clubs and activities // which need counselors ; each faculty will have to do that for its own school . The charter may carry a provision that the faculty through the principal may appoint one or more counselors for any organized or unorganized activity , with specified powers and duties . Many clubs may operate with no formal advice whatever ; others must have constant supervision . Counselors will usually be selected on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one school asks teachers to express preferences at the end of each year , as a basis to help with student activities . The heart of citizenship counseling is that concerned with the actual student government itself . The two faculty delegates to the cabinet ( p. 247 ) , together with the sponsors of the legislative and judicial committees , of school publications , and of each of the other executive departments ? these are most truly guides to good citizenship . Whether they be teachers at the same time of physics , algebra , French , or literature , who will say that their work in these subjects is more important than their counseling in citizenship ' ? The counselors connected with the government should confer and work out a policy , even though that policy be the plan of doing as little advising as possible . Just as the teacher of the regular subjects ' tries to reduce the amount of the old-fashioned reciting , and to induce the students to undertake much independent study , so the counselor develops the ideal of selfguidance , and approaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ability to let children learn , we might advocate a plan by which a counselor could become a secretary of publications , ' or the judicial committee a class in civics . But teachers would probably assume too much leadership and spoil the opportunity for student government . Perhaps the counselor for publications should be kept so busy with other work that he or she can not find time to read every word of the proof sheets ! The average teacher 's notions of her responsibility ' might well be amended or forgotten by those who become counselors for // student government . It is certain , from experience well tried , that the teachers should at the earliest possible moment begin to stay away occasionally from meetings of the legislative and judicial committees . The student vote and the right of appeal are sufficient checks , and the pupils will seek counsel when they need it . The counselor who can not counsel in absence should not be counselor . So far as possible the faculty should rid itself of those petty jealousies that interfere with freedom of conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain counsel wherever he can , and to discuss alternatives impersonally with his official counselor . Counselors for citizenship should by no rneans give most of their attention to the leaders and officers . Scales of civic action should be drawn up , based on some such analysis as that of page 226 , and from time to time every student should be graded , as a diagnosis of his needs . The aim of citizenship guidance in the school is for every person to achieve high skill in each of the appropriate activities . Here as in other forms of guidance , the counseling should grow out of the class work , and both should be based on the activities . Other agencies for citizenship guidance . While the civics class is naturally the most directly useful agent among the school studies , yet others have much to offer . Oral English can perform important services : teach parliamentary law , and furnish the setting for the discussion of civic issues . Experience has shown that parliamentary law can not be taught in the medium of trivial subjects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students to select and adopt some supposed organization , to give a basis for the work . The city council is a common choice , and the pupils , in learning about committee reports and other parliamentary matters will build libraries , pave streets , lay out parks , and pass laws . Other common selections are : improvement association , senate , state assembly , cabinet , board of education , labor union , peace conference . While there is little time for // studying forms , and little need for such study , on the other hand the presenting of problems as problems is an excellent result of the work . Geography is supposed to have a good citizenship resultant , yet little has been accomplished to realize this expectation . Mere knowledge of other peoples may not serve this end . History should serve excellently , but again the ideal of facts has dominated . A background of knowledge is important , but if one asks important for what ? ' there is only one answer ? right civic action . Why not then measure the civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of foreign language a help in the foreign relations portion of citizenship duties ? Frankly , we do not know . But it would be a person of naive imagination who would assert that those Americans who have studied French in high school or college were best informed and most to be trusted in deciding the question of collecting the money with which France recovered from the war . Doubtless languages are broadening but in just what ways and to just what consequences in action we have yet to learn . The class in occupations too could show the world 's interdependence , and the civic implications and relationships in vocational life . Military drill in high schools and colleges is supposed to be a citizenship observance in pure simplicity : national defense . ' In war time it is solely a service to citizenship . But in educational circles , as is our wont , we immediately construct other arguments that would indicate that when war is abolished from the earth we shall still have to have guns and bayonets and first sergeants to teach erect carriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other virtues . Yet it has never been convincingly proved ? perhaps in the nature of things it would be hard to do so ? that drill is needed for these purposes . Drill is sometimes used as an agent of school discipline , effectively no doubt , but with many subtile bad effects . " The uniforms teach democracy " says one advocate , but the whole organization is // necessarily a denial of democracy : arrogance , superiority , rank , refusal of officers to associate with privates , hats on during prayers when all other men have them off , the exquisite torture by one officer of another on superficial matters of dress or ceremony ? all these things are too evident to need elaboration . Of course , also , the leadership taught by drill goes only to the officers , ? one-seventh of the boys , ? and is at the price of blind obedience learned by the others ( if indeed it is learned ? there are contrary evidences ) . Adults who explain what drill did for them , may be asked if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as war exists an army is necessary , that men should give service in time of peace , as does Switzerland , that college students who wish to do so should train for positions as officers , we still have no evidence that high school boys should have drill . Its great extension since the war has not been founded on adequate considerations . Readiness for military service is a necessary duty of citizenship , but meanwhile we are playing with fire . For man most naturally turns to the tools at hand : in a quarrel the mind turns easily to a gun that has been tucked away in the pocket , or to well-trained fists . ' Will the cause of peace be served by high school drill ? If so , at least discuss the reasons in the class in citizenship , and give opportunity for contrary opinions . Above all , keep the whole activity away from the school government . If there is no place for trials , attorneys , judges , police , and jails in student government there can be no place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and the rules of the board of education : an activity handed down outside the student government . // General Robert E. Lee stated that military education " is the worst possible preparation for civil life . " 1 Travel and correspondence among the children of various nations are important agencies for good will . Student organizations of other countries are acting as guides , and American college students may yet generate an active interest in political matters . ' There is urgent need for financing trips to this country ; the foreign student finds expense well-nigh prohibitive . Similarly , even the expense of paper and postage deters foreign children 's correspondence ; what a splendid investment is ready ! The Junior Red Cross and other student organizations interested in travel and correspondence should be utilized by teachers . Other kinds of guidance can often become agencies for that for citizenship ; for example , vocational . The coal owners , in conflict with their workmen , and having violated their wage agreernent " in order to save their businesses and keep the mines open , " come reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell about their profits only if forced to do so . The building trades unions tie up the construction of a public school building because they can not decide whether tile setters or bricklayers shall handle brick tile . Here are examples of industry and governmental control impinging upon each other . Similarly , the control of recreation , homes , religion , health , and education furnish opportunities for integrating the various kinds of guidance . A committee to study further . In this program for an approach to citizenship , where shall we look for the active workers , and how shall they be prepared ? We need not lay out a specific program of studies for citizenship teachers and guides ; it will be a good day when departments of social studies and of education will cooperate to furnish comprehensive training for // teachers , and this training must itself be guidance , with practice and laboratory experience of a high grade and diversified character . ' Meanwhile , teachers already in service will be interested in self-improvement . Let them have a group for reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps in vacation time , for some form of social service as near as may be to official organizations . Summary of guidance for citizenship . Though we have emphasized chiefly the better-ordering of the school community itself , we have indicated also the complexities and difficulties of adult citizenship . The transition and union between the two are not easy to work out ; this is one of the interesting challenges for alert teachers of classes in civics . The chief points in a comprehensive program of guidance for citizenship may be summarized as follows : 1 . Participation in the activities of a rich and wholesome juvenile community , together with the beginnings of civic life in the larger group . 2 . Participation in the control of these activities under a charter or grant of power , and by means of laws , officers , and other agencies . 3 . Qualified counselors for the fostering or sponsoring of these activities and controls . 4 . Classes in school and college for discussion of and information on the problems of government in a juvenile community , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 5 . Committees of teachers for the study of the problems of citizenship within and without the school , for reports to the faculty , cooperation with other committees , and continual improvement of the work , in cooperation with the student community itself . The next steps and necessary compromises with present sys- // tems of school management are : a frank discussion by authorized counselors , with responsible students , of the problems of student control and participation ; the education of the faculty and student body on these problems ; and the gradual setting up of real beginnings in student government . Civics classes should pay attention to the discussion of problems of school control , with less emphasis on the machinery of adult citizenship . As the results of effective guidance for citizenship we may expect young people to be thoroughly cooperative with each other and with adult authority , learning the beginnings of self and group discipline . By more extended forms of guidance in citizenship , we may hope to achieve a juvenile community skillful in setting up and administering effective standards for behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and officers and fully in control of its corporate undertakings . CHAPTER X VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE ? EARLIER PHASES Mutuality in vocational life . The division of labor , one of the major characteristics of modern civilization , sets up a form of occupational life under which each worker renders goods or services to other workers , who in turn offer goods or services to him . This reciprocal relationship may be called enlightened selfishness ' by some , but the fact of mutuality persists . Moreover , the day by day activities of vocational life offer numerous opportunities for the expression of unselfishness . Men and women are finding that progress and promotion come to them most rapidly and satisfactorily when they help their fellow-workers , rather than when they compete in uncharitable fashion . They find that such helpfulness seems to add to the scope of opportunity . Conversely , dust and ashes frequently are the lot of him who schemes and plots and wins out ' at the expense of others . If it is possible for plumber , waiter , and clerk to act according to this principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , then there rests upon the schools and colleges an enormous burden of responsibility for giving the requisite vocational guidance towards achieving this end . For the school authorities to see such a possibility as that which we have outlined , only to neglect it , is a sin against the progress of righteousness . It was William C. Redfield , former Secretary of Commerce , who when in Congress propounded the theory that the way for manufacturers to prosper is to pay high wages to workmen . ' This doctrine , considered senseless and scandalous at first , has now made such headway that it is openly practiced by a grow- // ing number of industrial and commercial establishments , given lip service by almost all , and opposed by very few . It is no wonder that a doctrine so directly opposite to all the dictates of selfishness , and to all the preachments of the last century economists and their modern successors , should make slow headway . But the pupils of today , who will be mature workers twenty years hence , can be taught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the method of realizing the ideal . If vocational life were organized on the mere getting basis , it could not last a day . The credit structure is often spoken of as an evidence of good-will and trust , and so it is ; nevertheless it has machinery for enforcing collection . Not so immediate is the enforcement of mutuality . Two men who were establishing a clothing factory were overheard in a train convexsation . They talked of buildings , labor , finance , wool , and many other things , but not at all about furnishing clothing to people who needed it . Yet they doubtless knew that the manufacture of goods which people do not want would lead them to failure . They further knew , though they might not recognize it in this form , that the jobs which they created must offer satisfactory careers to their workers , and also that the workers they selected must cooperate with each other , each worker incorporating as part of his own success the success of others . One New England factory was tied up for half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spite , held back the flow of partly-made shoes , and then suddenly dumped ' them on the next department . Disregard of the law of mutuality has wrecked men and business by the legion . It seems true that by following the policy of crass self-seeking a number of persons achieve a precarious livelihood , and that some make fortunes . But they are only sand in the bearings of the wheel of progress , and oftener than not are ground to powder . A few clothing merchants , by dint of alluring advertising and hypnotic salesmanship , might sell suits that people do not want or ought not to want . A few drug peddlers and // bootleggers can sell goods that have been made illegally , furnishing evils and disservices instead of goods and services . A number of persons get their living by furnishing luxuries that unquestionably do harm . But nine out of ten , or more likely nine hundred ninety-nine out of a thousand , have the satisfaction of handling honest goods and furnishing useful service . Young people in school should learn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own future careers . The mistake of condemning vocational life . If this conclusion is valid , it seems strange that in the highest educational circles vocational life is frequently spoken of with disparagement . Cultural versus vocational ' is an expression used not seldom , though it is no more sensible than would be the use of the same versus in referring to pupil and teacher , or husband and wife . If life is anything like a unity , the schools and colleges have need to give young people greater assistance in seeing life as a unity , and in working out harmonious relationships between ethics and success , culture and work . If education fails to grapple honestly with this need , why call it liberal education ? That man is not educated who has cultural interests , but whose cultural life is in conflict with his life of duty , or takes the form of a romantic escape from reality . Thoreau 's statement , The expression ' a liberal education ' originally meant one worthy of freemen . Such is education simply in a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learning of trades and professions which is designed to enable men to earn their living , or to fit them for a particular station in life ? is servile . classes him with a notable company of good people , from Aristotle to Dean X of your college . Thoreau very properly criticised the pettiness and futility of many vocational activities , and the dean rightly criticizes the narrowness and sordidness of many kinds of vocational education . The truth is merely that everything should be in its place , and that the narrowing of the educational aim ? for vocational education must neces292 EDUCATION AS GUIDANCE sarily prepare for one small line of activity ? should be seasonably delayed , and never too absorbing . Vocational guidance is not the same as vocational education ; the former is a necessary part of liberal education . No one has a liberal education who has refused to think about the service he will render society through his vocation , and has failed to make definite plans therefor . Such a person is himself subject to a kind of servility , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fail to offer his best to society . Making a living versus making a life ' is only another formula of those who think they prove by epigram . If there is any way to make a life without making a living , it has not yet been discovered ; further , no occupation is worth the effort of an educated man which does not contribute to the building up of his whole life . The fortunate college professor , who has in his own vocation a coincidence of work and culture , should refrain from condemning those workers who can not yet achieve this concomitance . The college must offer vocational guidance of a sort which will train its graduates to harmonize work and culture , to amalgamate them into a well-rounded life . If in this way the educated portion of the community could improve their own occupational life , we might begin with a surer touch the task of making all work achieve the goal of mutuality and excellence . If the college man despises any necessary kinds of work , his education has failed him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given in a chapter from the Apocrypha , Ecclesiasticus 38 . After praise for artificers and workmasters , followed by beautiful descriptions of the work and the spirit of the engraver , the smith , and the potter , the following lines occur : All these put their trust in their hands , And each becometh wise in his own work . Yea , though they be not sought for in the council of the people , Nor be exalted in the assembly ; Though they sit not on the seat of the judge , Nor understand the covenant of judgment ; // Though they declare not instruction and judgment , And be not found among them that utter dark sayings : Yet without these shall not a city be inhabited , Nor shall men sojourn or walk up and down therein . For these maintain the fabric of the world , And in the handiwork of their craft is their prayer . The vocation basic to all other activities . Mr. Micawber is a classic instance of the fact that vocational success is necessary to success in other activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worker ; how fared his life in general ? Did he succeed in his home relationships ? was he a good citizen ? did he make satisfactory use of his leisure time and recreation ? Dickens gives us a true picture , and it is being repeated today in the lives of unguided and misguided workers . No real life can be lived on the basis of vocational failure . It is not only personal success which requires vocational efficiency but the success of all our institutional life as well . A group of high school teachers in Haverhill , Massachusetts , was shown a well-known book on the shoe industry , with the remark that they were doubtless already familiar with it . Not one had seen it . It was then pointed out that the reason for the city 's existence lay in the shoe industry , that their desirable institutions ? homes , libraries , churches , fraternal organizations , city government , schools , clubs , hospitals ? could not possibly exist without the shoe industry , or other occupations to take its place . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosperity of the shoe industry , should study the cause , prevention , and cure of loss of orders , - seasonal work , disputes , strikes , and other difficulties ; otherwise they would be poorly prepared to assume the management of the city . This is no attempt to maintain that because the vocation is basic it is more important than other departments of life , the fact being that of itself the vocation is not the most important . To act in righteousness , to be a good citizen , to carry on the home successfully ? these are all of greater importance . But the vocation is a sine qua non , a fundamental , without which // most other enterprises would fall . It furnishes the support , much as does the foundation of a building , but the analogy will not suffice , for the vocation , as we shall see , has intrinsic values as a super-structure . The bases of all practices in vocational guidance , whether valid or erroneous , need to be exposed to view and examined in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be found that neither getting ahead ' nor self-effacement is the right policy , neither the policy of rigid diagnosis and prescription nor acting wholly on personal desires , neither reaching for goals far ahead nor wholly accommodating oneself to present limitations , neither paying chief attention to the higher ' callings nor failing to help children achieve promotion , neither acquiescence in injustices apparently incurable nor blind and sterile opposition , neither looking far ahead nor keeping eyes only on the present , neither forgetting to apply the ethical measure to occupations nor applying it after the manner of a millenarian . To all of these problems vocational guidance must give answer before its work can be made effective ; but meanwhile it has much to offer , and to these more practical topics we now proceed . The individual aim of vocational guidance . From the standpoint of the individual 's adjustments and success , no one has stated the steps in the process better than Frank Parsons . He writes in his book , Choosing a Vocation ( Houghton Mifflin Co. ) , and in The Arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vocation there are three broad factors : ( 1 ) a clear understanding of yourself , your aptitudes , abilities , interests , ambitions , resources , limitations , and their causes ; ( 2 ) a knowledge of the requirements and conditions of success , advantages and disadvantages , compensation , opportunities , and prospects in different lines of work ; ( 3 ) true reasoning on the relations of these two groups of facts . . . . The Vocation Bureau is intended to aid young people in choosing an occupation , preparing themselves for it , finding an opening in it , and building up a career of efficiency and success . // The present writer several years ago set forth these items in the Six Steps ' as indicated in the accompanying diagram . figure Self-discovery and study of vocations should proceed simultaneously , and both together lead to choice , whether tentative // or permanent . After choice , whether at once or after a shorter or longer period of continued general education , actual preparation for the vocation begins , followed in succession by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary ladder of progress for the individual , hence , correspondingly , the purpose of vocational guidance must be to help him take them . Vocational guidance sets up plans accordingly . It should clearly be understood that the present generation of workers has followed no such logical path . The first serious contact with the economic world is likely to be getting a job . But at this point , step six , readjustment , begins . And this readjustment leads to self-discovery , knowledge of occupations , a new decision , and often to new training and a new job . The fact is that the sixth step , for all workers , whether their careers are well planned or not , involves a recapitulation or review of each of the other five . Vocational counseling likes to see things done in an orderly way , without wrong starts , but it is not averse to offering help at any point on the ladder . Before proceeding to an exposition of what we shall call the social aim of vocational guidance , let us remind the reader that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual acts according to the principles of mutuality and unselfishness explained at the beginning of this chapter . The social aim as we shall expound it does not relate to carrying on one 's own occupation in a socialized manner ; that is the individual aim . One 's own occupation can never be carried on in disregard to social principles unless he be a criminal , a parasite , a hermit , or a very short-sighted person . The social aim of vocational guidance . The necessary mutuality in carrying one 's career to individual success is matched by an even greater mutuality in the cooperative effort to build a better world of occupations . Hence the social aim of vocational VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE ? EARLIER PHASES 297. guidance is to guide students in knowledge and wisdom which will equip them for and impel them towards the solution of those larger problems of occupational life which are too big to be solved by individual action alone . Thus one may be ever so good a coal miner , but , notwithstanding , out of employment and in poverty a great part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that presents vast problems of unionism , overproduction , and absentee ownership , and these can never be solved by one owner or by one miner . Possibly a Mr. Ford , with great resources of capital and imagination may solve the problem so far as his own coal field is concerned , but it is certain that most owners need much more knowledge and morale than they now have , and that the miners themselves , union and non-union , need more help than they can exert as mere individuals . The same is true of farming . There is evidence that in 1921 , and again in 1929 , whether by design or not , the farmers were made to bear more than their share of the calling in of loans , and that industry ( factories ) , very much expanded , was not deflated as most impartial students expected it to be . To the usual work of the farmer to plant on faith in weather , markets , and other contingencies , was added that of foreclosure . No single farmer , be he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a problem by himself alone . Indeed , both in producing and especially in marketing , united action is inescapable . Furthermore , and this is the apex of the social aim , you and I , and editors , and congressmen , and citizens generally , must know enough about the farmers ' problems to be able to support the right measures and men . Vocational life generates these vast problems , and cooperative action of all citizens is required , quite aside from the problems of one 's own calling . Many of the larger issues obtrude themselves into political circles , for government furnishes us our machinery of agreement and control . The following are the vocational topics discussed in recent political party platforms : tariff , foreign debts , income tax , coal miners , relationship between capital and labor , labor unions , railway workers , radio control , power development and control , // farming , civil service , banking , child labor , women 's Work , unemployment , convict labor , and shipping ; and these concern only the federal government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the total space in the Republican Party platform of 1928 is devoted to occupational topics , 62,1 per cent in the Democratic , and 71 per cent in the Socialist . The Republican Party in 1920 made the astonishing declaration that labor and capital should be considered as partners . Party documents may have little decisive importance , but they show the overlapping of occupational and political life , and point towards our social aim . Not only do these gigantic vocational issues gravitate towards governments for settlement , but also certain classes of workers begin to affect the development and solution of important problems , thereby controlling the well-being of millions of workers . It is often said that the interests of Wall Street control stocks and bonds and other loans , and thus directly or indirectly go far toward relieving the government ( ourselves in cooperation ) of working out our own solutions . Technicians , whether financial or engineering or managerial , may be gaining a control which will give solutions into their hands . If financiers , capitalists , technicians , engineers , managers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences , the logic of the situation is not to offer unthinking opposition , but to protect ourselves , through training them in skill and educating them in technical knowledge and wisdom , so that they will turn out neither exploiters nor profiteers , but the public servants they should be . And this can be said without in the slightest degree approving the condition of affairs as we have described it . Capitalism in its modern mass-production form is but a little more than a century old . It may be superseded by another and a better system . But the way to deserve a better ordering of society is for us to make the best of the present one . No man has been a stronger supporter of the capitalistic system than Herbert Hoover ; yet he is one of its most severe critics . The // report by him and his associates , assessing the responsibility for preventable waste in manufacturing establishments , placed twice as much blame upon owners and managers as upon laborers . The capitalistic system must be made as perfect as possible ; only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this obligation to proceed by evolution lies securely in the three alternatives which present themselves to us . First , we may call this present industrial organization a satisfactory system , and seek for no changes . But unemployment , injustice , poverty , strife , and war are evidences of imperfections . ' Second , we might abolish the system , and go back to homespuns and corncakes . But this we will not do ; we are committed as irrevocably to machine-made products and to what we call civilized ' methods of sanitation , travel , food , clothing , reading , and housing as we are to the mother tongue . The hands of the clock will not turn back : our romantic essayists who write about the good old days still wear shoes made by 150 workers and ride in automobiles and trains . Third , we may learn the technique of this industrialized civilization of ours , make it our servant , and gradually change it into something better . This we shall do , if at all , by the effective working out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This notion of gradual change is worth special attention . Our industrial civilization has already proceeded to such a point that we are greatly dependent on each other ; indeed , on thousands of workers we never see . In large cities sudden disaster might result from the default of workers in but one calling ? water department , electric light and gas works , street railway , grocery stores , or steam railways . Certain strikes have already given some hints of danger , and it seems clear that if // the silence caused by stoppages should once descend on our large cities it might swiftly be followed by starvation , disease , and armed conflict . Apparently civilization once running must be kept in motion . The dream of a series of general strikes , the last being one for the ownership of the means of production , is seen to be impractical , because long before that time all or most of these means of production would have been destroyed , and the common workers would suffer most . The technical knowledge and wisdom necessary to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 asserts that the technicians have it all in the hollow of their hand , and could out-general the financial interests if they would , but he expresses the pessimistic view that they will not use this power for the benefit of society . Perhaps if this be so it is because the members of society in general are so ignorant about the real situation that they would not even know how to support the technicians in their attempts at amelioration . Theoretically , there is no reason why a group of engineering and labor technicians , as Owen D. Young 2 has suggested , can not organize a company without any capitalists or capital stock whatever , commanding the credit of small investors everywhere . Doubtless we shall see some such attempt ere long , but it will need the cooperation of large numbers of vocationally enlightened citizens . Meanwhile hundreds of employers and progressive unions are experimenting in social justice and pointing the way . The social aim of vocational guidance is more important than the individual one . We do not minimize the importance of the school 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocations , but if the coming generation of citizens will develop the necessary desire and intelligence to organize occupational life for better things , the problem of individual success will be much more easily solved . // The importance of vocational guidance . The achieving of this large social objective is therefore one of the great needs of the schools . Let us consider merely occupational information and limit its application to the social aim , using geography by way of comparison . Schools teach the geography of South America , and that continent has many interesting and important features . There are great and prosperous countries , lines of travel by land and water , thickly settled cities , open country , quiet and fertile valleys , mountain peaks , storms , volcanoes , deserts , swamps , and plateaus , and interesting peoples , languages , and customs . The study of all these features is important for students , because we shall have closer relationships to South America , and many of the next generation may travel in that continent . But there are great continents of occupational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professions . Industry has important features : great and prosperous areas , lines of travel and communication , valleys , mountains , congested places , open territory awaiting settlement , deserts , and interesting people and customs . It also has hurricanes , tornadoes , and volcanoes . And , similarly , the members of the next generation will have many close relationships with the continent of Industry , and about one-third of them are certain to travel personally into it . Is it not well therefore that children should study these features of occupational life , at least as systematically as they now study geography ? Consider a second figure , relating more directly to the individual aim in vocational guidance . The children entering upon work are like a long line of swimmers walking out on a springboard to plunge into the water . Each poises himself on the end of the board to take his dive . He must not stop long , for behind him there are many others ready to make the plunge . But before he dives should we not assure ourselves ( 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) that the boy knows how to handle himself in the air and in the water ? In an investigation of the children 14 and 15 years of age who have recently left school for work in our Empire State ' it was found // that only one in 20 had received any occupational information or vocational guidance in the school , and only one in 100 had been helped by the school in securing work . In an investigation of normal school students it was discovered that teachers have almost never been a factor in helping a girl to decide to become a teacher : parents , chums , relatives , and chance acquaintances offer the advice . Pathetic letters written by students in vocationally apathetic schools and colleges come to public men , bureaus of vocational guidance , Christian associations , and numerous departments at Washington , begging for advice on how to find out what to do . English influence has been strong in American liberal arts colleges , but we have missed one point of comparison . It can successfully be maintained that the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the level of the Oxford or Cambridge student . The English student has had very careful educational guidance , and tradition , class , and custom have rather definitely marked out his future vocation . " The Oxford or Cambridge undergraduate is much more likely to have decided already on his future career than has the American undergraduate , " writes an American Rhodes scholar at Oxford . The list of callings appropriate to family influence and to the tradition of the gentleman is not large , while in America scores of opportunities challenge the attention . In the lower levels of occupational service moral welfare itself is involved in our persistent neglect of vocational guidance . Clarence Darrow makes the following statement in a newspaper interview . There is only one solution for crime that I think is of any avail . Most crimes of violence begin with children who are reared in poor districts of the big cities and who have had no education or bringing up . If the public schools would take up the question of fitting every one of them for some occupation , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not fitted and would thus fit children for life and its problems , I think most crime would disappear . This , of course , will take time , as any important thing takes time , but there is no other solution . // We need not elaborate the , valid but more familiar arguments for the giving of adequate vocational guidance : the growing complexity of occupational life , the multiplication of opportunities , the no admission ' signs , the lack of trustworthy information , the other-worldly ' character of the school offering , premature school leaving , child labor , finding work , unsteady employment , difficulty of knowing one 's real interests and abilities , the changed character of the home . Under each of the steps in the diagram on page 295 the need is evident , and the school 's responsibility is beyond question . Further , as indicated in our analogies used above , vocational decisions and activities are inevitable . One may avoid home duties , forego recreation , dodge citizenship , neglect religion , and do without education , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in proper form it will be received in uncertain or unreliable forms . If a boy fails to discover his abilities , through some tribulations he will discover disabilities for a longer or shorter period until one or more of his powers become apparent . If he does not learn vocational opportunities , he will have such information pounded into his consciousness by the wasteful teacher , experience . If he makes no rational decision , he will take his steps nevertheless , until one made in ignorance leads to some measure of relative satisfaction . If he fails to train himself for his work , he will be trained by the orders of the boss . He must seek work , and he must make readjustments , even if these be forced on him in his naivete and ignorance . But no person interested in education can believe that naivete and ignorance are satisfactory equipment for any kind of complex activity . Vocational relationships are difficult enough to understand ; guidance should not be withheld . Offered , it will furnish boys and girls with skill , knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a better world . Effective guidance should help to prevent crime . " The danger point in American life is . . . the man who chooses crime as a means of livelihood , " said Warden Lawes of Sing Sing in his // The skilled activities needed for doing one 's part in achieving the social aim of vocational guidance are very similar to the skills listed for citizenship , pages 226 and 230 : conference , committee work , arguing , agreeing , compromising , planning , executing , and the like . The following skills directly above will also be helpful : 1-6 , 10-12 , 39 , 40 . In addition , success in one 's own calling is a good starting point for cooperation in improving occupational life in general . N.E.A. speech in 1932 . Drs . Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck found ( Predictability in the Administration of Criminal Justice , Harvard Law School ) that a man 's favorable vocational adjustment is the best index of his probable success in reformation . Education and educational people will gain from the effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guide in other fields ; it will make us less impractical , and cure us of our detachment from active life ; it will help us to understand and improve our own calling and to recruit better teachers for future children . The specific elements of vocational guidance . We here present an analysis , as in preceding chapters , in the three-fold form of skilled action , technical knowledge , and wisdom . We shall follow the outline of page 295 , asking the reader to remember that all the experiences of the first two steps are needed for the one act of choice . Vocational choice is of course a complex act , requiring a background of much exploration and knowledge , and usually is not suddenly consummated . We shall not attempt a comprehensive statement of vocational guidance . Its general outlines have been set forth by many writers , among them Parsons , Bloomfield , Davis , Allen , Proctor , Kitson , Koos and Kefauver , Edgerton , Keller , Cohen , Jones , Hatcher , Maverick , and Myers . Practice in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor , and the White House Conference has prepared extensive reports . Two case books have been printed , and The Vocational Guidance Magazine furnishes information about current ideas and new methods . The growth of the movement is shown by an interesting comparison : In 1915 Bloomfield published his book of 45 articles , and only 4 of the authors were regular or full310 EDUCATION AS GUIDANCE time workers in the field of vocational guidance . In 1927 Allen 's two books contained 81 articles , 46 of which were written by actual workers in this field . The best contribution for the remainder of this treatment may be made by way of a summary of the techniques of vocational guidance , with a few excursions into problems and solutions not heretofore discussed in print . The major tools of vocational guidance . Like the other forms of guidance , the vocational depends on the three chief tools sample activities , classes , and counseling . Speaking by and large , the samples are designed to give the needed activities , the classes the technical knowledge , and the counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abilities . Samples of occupational experiences are not the only method of discovering interests and abilities . This and other agencies are incorporated in the following list : HOW VOCATIONAL ABILITY MAY BE DISCOVERED 1 . Through practical studies and methods of teaching that show connections with vocational life 2 . Through definite exploratory courses , offering sample tasks from a number of the common occupations 3 . Through tests drawn from sample tasks in occupational life , measuring the abilities developed in planned or casual experiences 4 . Through student activities , requiring work resembling those of certain occupations 5 . Through clubs , scouting , and recreational experiences outside the school , or activities in the home 6 . Through counseling and questioning , which may bring to light interests and abilities 7 . Through standardized contacts , allowing front-seat ' observation of work , with possible participation in simple tasks 8 . Through working experience , with or without pay Of all these possibilities the actual exploratory classes without doubt offer the most systematic method .
