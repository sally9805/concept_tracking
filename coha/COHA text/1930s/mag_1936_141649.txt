Scripps-Howard 's parent company entered Memphis 30 years ago with the Press . In 1926 , the Press swallowed the News-Scimitar . Same year the powerful old morning Commercial Appeal aimed an Evening Appeal at the Press-Scimitar . Just before the Evening Appeal appeared , Editor &; Publisher Charles Patrick Joseph Mooney suddenly died . Because Mr. Mooney had been a great &; able editor , the Appeal papers languished without him . Promoters Luke Lea and Rogers ( " We Bank on the South " ) Caldwell acquired the papers in 1927 , milked them of cash , lost them to receivers when the Lea-Caldwell empire collapsed in 1930 . <P> In 1933 , James Thomas Hammond Jr . appeared to buy the Appeals with money loaned by " friends in the Scripps-Howard organization .
