LISA A STORY BY TED ALLAN cUNDAY morning the sun burst through my hotel windows and woke me before Lisa ' phoned . On the street the Madrilenos were going to work . Women carrying baskets hurried to get a good place in the food queues . The morning papers lay on my bed and I read that the day before Brunete had been entered twice by the rebels who had been driven out twice by the government troops . There had been heavy fighting . The telephone rang . " Bob ? " " Yes . Lisa ? At the War Ministry ? Coming right over . " The streetcar was crowded . A heated discussion was taking place . " Brunete 's retaken . " " No , it is n't . " " It is . " " It is n't . " " Awl what does it matter if it is ? We 've taken Quijorna , Villanueva de la Canada , and Villanueva de la Pardillo . That 's our new army . I tell you we 'll soon sweep them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian troops . " " Italian troops ? Did you ever hear of a place called Guadalajara ? " I got off . Lisa was waiting beside the car . She wore khaki overalls and her blonde hair was flying . I told her about the discussion on the streetcar . She smiled . The chauffeur , whose name was Sanche , could speak only American , not English . Okay was the word he knew . He was attached to the division . He would take us right to the front lines outside Brunete . " Let 's sing , " Lisa said . " Okay , " said Sanche . We sang French songs , English songs , American songs , German songs , and Spanish songs until we got tired . Lisa held up her hands and yawned happily . " Well , to-morrow I go to Paris . Too bad you ca n't come with me . I must get some good action pictures . If they are still fighting near Brunete it will be my chance to get some good ones . " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you want me to take pictures ? long distance ? " " That 's an idea . " " Are you frightened ? " " Yes . Are n't you ? " She laughed . " Yes . " Sanche began describing how the fields round Brunete stank from the dead . Both of us had been in Brunete during the Last week so we knew how it stank . But Sanche wanted to make it more elaborate . He not only described the stink but the guts , the smashed heads of men . He was young or he would have been quiet . The sun was strong . There was hardly any traffic on the road . We passed Villanueva de la Canada and saw the sanitary corps stationed along the road . Blood-streaked stretchers were lying in the ditches waiting . " Tell me , do you think we 'll win ? " she asked . " That 's a funny question to ask now . " " Well , what do you think ? " " You know what I think . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you really think ? " " Well , if Great Britain would stop making bargains with Mussolini the war would be over soon . And then the embargo on arms . And if Italian troops continue to be sent in  --  well , I do n't know . " " They must . We can not lose . We must not . Do you realize what it would mean ? " She stamped her foot . " No . I am sure . We shall win . " " Not if they keep on sending Italian troops . " She looked at me out of the corner of her eye . " Did you ever hear of a place called Guadalajara ? " Sanche wanted to know what we were laughing at but Lisa told him it would take too long to explain . " Okay , " he said . We stopped . Division headquarters . We walked through a rolling wheat field . Everything was strangely quiet . " Where are the lines ? " " Right in front . Back of the hill . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lisa . The General somehow was n't glad to see us . " Of all days to come , " he groaned . " You must go back immediately . Go back . Go right back ! " " What ! I am going to Paris to-morrow . This is my last chance to get some action pictures . I must stay . Please let me stay . " " No ! " yelled the General . " Take her away someone . Go away immediately . I tell you I can not be responsible for you . Who let you come ? Go away . In five minutes there will be hell . " " Come , " I said . " You can go . I 'm staying here . " " But the General says . . . " " To hell with the General . " The General had meanwhile gone into his dugout so he did n't hear her . " Please come . Please . This is no place for us . " " You can go . This is exactly the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay . I think you 're crazy . You and your action pictures . I should n't have let you come . But let 's get away from the General . There are some dugouts on the little hill there . " We snuggled into a dugout big enough for my feet . We heard the drone of planes . Twelve of them . You could see the tiny pursuit planes flying around them like flies . The drone became louder , louder , louder , and they came so slowly . You felt that they would stop in midair . But they did n't stop . They turned and swung toward us . Then thunder . Then black clouds  --  about a hundred yards in front of us . Again thunder . Again . Again . Lisa was busy taking pictures . I was trying to see what I could use to make the hole larger . Thunder . A shower of earth . " Put your head down ! " she shouted . " Where 'll I put it ? I ca n't put it into my chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Crash . Black . Acrid smoke . Dirt , Dust . Fear . " Are you all right ? " " Who , me ? " she said . " Sure . You ? " " Sure . " The air cleared . The stuttering drone became dimmer . Heads began to appear out of dugouts . Soldiers grinned . Some looked pale and did n't grin . " Why do n't you go ? I can take the pictures . I 'll meet you in El Escorial . " " Now please do n't be a pest , " she said . A drone . A soft hum . Just imagination . It becomes louder . Twenty planes come out of the sky . The planes came for one hour in relays . They bombed the government lines and while they were bombing the rebel shells were coming at the same time . There were no government planes . It was about one o'clock when they started . Lisa asked the time . Two o'clock . Suddenly quiet . We looked ludicrous in that hole in the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa somehow managed to get her feet underneath mine . " If they come again you 'd better watch your head , " she said ; " shrapnel you know . " " I know . But you 're taking pictures and your head is above the ground . " " Yes . But I must take pictures and you do n't have to . " Again we heard the drone . " Look , they 're not bombers . " Nine biplanes flying low swung toward the road which stretched behind us . Lisa clicked her camera . Her film camera lay in its leather case beside the unfinished dugout . The first plane turned on its side , swung low , and we heard the tatatat-tata-tat of machine-gun fire . The second plane did the same . The third . The fourth . All nine of them and then the first began again . Then twelve bombers came and bombed the lines . Then the shells came and for fifteen minutes there was black hell . " It must end some time , " I said . Lisa did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoke which came from the bombs and took pictures of the dust and white smoke which came from the shells . She took picture after picture and I sat there crouching . Suddenly she said , " Put your head down . " The planes swung toward us . They saw us . They must have seen her camera flashing in the sun . There was a machine gun in the next dugout . They must have seen that too . It was n't camouflaged well . Men crawled about when they should have been lying quiet . The first plane turned on its side and dived gently toward us . The earth in front of the hole began to rise in short spurts . Tata-tat-tata-tat . Tata-tat-tata-tat . Lisa got a picture of the earth jumping in spurts . Then she took pictures of the planes as they came down toward us . " Damn it , the roll is finished . " To place another roll would have meant raising her body . Tata-tat  --  tata-tat . Monotonous nerve-racking drone . I grabbed the film camera lying beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from the machine-gun bullets . " You fool , " she said ; " it 'll break the camera . " " Shut up now or I 'll break your head . " I wanted something to protect my face . It was uncovered . I formed a mental picture of where the bullet would hit and how it would look . I wanted something to cover my face , anything , a piece of paper . I grabbed a clump of earth and held it on my head . We crouched there like that . The planes were still strafing . I heard a suppressed giggle . Lisa 's body was shaking . " If you could only sec yourself , " she said . Then the bombers came again , this time thirty of them . We counted . Clouds of black smoke rose in front of us . Then we heard a terrific noise of machine-gun fire . On the hill in front of us we saw men coming . They were coming all along the line . " We 're retreating , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Then came the strafing . The shells were n't hitting their mark but the bombing and strafing were enough . We saw men fly into the air . Lisa put another roll into her camera . She clicked it . I did n't know what was more maddening then , the planes or the camera . One section of the lines was orderly and the retreat went comparatively well . But a retreat is a retreat and there was confusion . Men got panicky and ran anywhere as long as they could run . In front of us a few took positions with guns and dared anyone to pass them . These stopped a panic . Lisa forgot about her camera and was yelling at the top of her lungs for them to stop and reform their lines . " Come on . For God 's sakes , woman , come on , " I pleaded . " No , no . The planes are still here . I would be silly to go now . It will soon be quiet . We must wait till the lines reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . " Her hand trembled as she took a cigarette from her cigarette case and lighted it . She offered me one but I did n't like Spanish cigarettes . It was quiet . The planes did their business and went . It was very quiet . The retreating men reformed their lines a little beyond the hill . Here and there a figure moved . A cool breeze came down from the Guadarrama . The wheat swayed gently . Behind the hill little puffs of clouds could be seen . There was not even a rifle shot . The Spanish countryside looked peaceful . I looked at the sky and it was peaceful too . " Come , let 's go , " she said . " What ? " " Yes . I 'm tired . " We got out of the hole and I took her film camera . She had not been able to use it . The division doctor , a Scotsman. , was coming toward us . He looked worn out . Many of his comrades had been killed . All his equipment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villanueva de la Canada . The lines were now between the two towns . The fascists obviously had had superiority that day in the air but they could n't follow up the retreat . On the road there were many dead . Men groaned and begged for agua , water . Some were silent . By this time Lisa had no more film . The planes came again . We flung ourselves beneath an overturned truck . But the planes passed over . They were n't looking for us . We got into Villanueva de Ia Canada and it stank . Two men were sitting beside a wounded comrade under cover of a hut 's remaining wall . They saw the doctor 's armband . " Please come . He is badly hurt . His legs . Please look at him . " The doctor was tired . " I 've got nothing . Nothing . No bandages . Nothing . What can I do ? He will have to wait for an ambulance . " " Please look at him . " The doctor went over to the man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they had gone through a meat-grinder . The man made no sound . His eyes were on the doctor 's face . Lisa said something about hoping that some day she 'd be able to take a different kind of picture . I said nothing . A tank passed . We stopped it , put the wounded man on , jumped on ourselves , and started . The planes came again . There were four tanks behind us . Clumsy-looking animals . The planes dived . Tata-tat-tata-tat . " Silly getting killed now after going through what we did . " " Bah , they ca n't hit a thing , " said Lisa . They did n't hit any of the tanks . The tank was hot . It snorted and wheezed and made a lot of noise and swung from side to side . We held on tightly . The white house beyond Villanueva de la Canada served as a dressing station . We took the wounded man off the tank . The doctor got a car and rushed away to get ambulances . The wounded were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few tanks stopped . It was silly . A marvelous target for planes . " Got the camera ? " she asked . " Yes . " A large black touring car came down the road . We stopped it and asked for a lift . " Sure , get on , " the chauffeur said . We jumped on the running board . " Lisa , you go on the other side . " " Why ? It is big enough . We can both stay here . " She put her cameras in the front seat of the car . There were three wounded men inside . Salud . Salud . She took a deep breath . " Boy  --  that was a day . I feel good . The lines reformed and I feel good . And I got the best pictures of my life . And you ? You have a good story , yes ? " " Yes . But next time I cover the war from the press office . I can describe it better that way . " " To-night we 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you find some excuse to come to Paris with me ? " " Between each bomb and shell that dropped I was thinking of an excuse . If my vacation were n't coming next month it would be simpler . God , I wish you were n't leaving . " " Me too . But we 'll have a nice time together to-night . " There was some confusion ahead of us . A tank was jerking ahead in spurts , swerving from side to side on the road . Our car swung to the left . " Hold on , " she laughed gaily . " You do n't want to fall off now and break your leg . " Something was wrong with the tank . I saw it . Just the front of the tank . Then I was on the road . Then I knew that both my legs were off . Then I knew they were n't . Then I saw the blood on my right leg and the pants torn on my left . There was no pain . " Lisa ! " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Donde estd mujer ! mujer ! mujer ! " Then I saw her face  --  just her face . The rest of her body was hidden by the car . She was screaming . Her eyes looked at me and asked me to help her , but I could not move . There was no pain but I could not move . The tank was quiet now . It had swung round and now it was quiet . The young Spanish driver looked at us . He was frightened . Then the planes came . The man beside me dropped . The other pulled me into the ditch . Everyone ran for the fields . " Lisa ! Where are you ? Lisa ! " The planes went away . " Donde estd muchacha ? Where is the girl ? " " She 's been put into an ambulance , " someone told me . " Are you sure ? Es verdadr " Si , si . " " And her camera ? Where is her cam-era ? " " I do n't know , " the Spanish boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was crumpled and the wooden buckle was broken into little pieces . " It is hers , " he said . " Where is the car ? " I asked . " Yo no . s . " Then someone brought me her purse . The handle was all twisted , Then I began to feel the pain . " Agua . Water . I want water . " But no one had water . They put me on a stretcher and placed me in an ambulance . There was no water . We stopped at a dressing station . " Did you see a young woman , una muchacha , a small pretty girl with blonde hair ? " " Muchacha ? There was no mucha-cha . " They gave me water . I looked at my watch . It was six-thirty . I put it to my ear but it did not tick . It had stopped . " Six-thirty . That 's when we were hit . " " What ? ' said the man lying beside me . " Nada . Como estd ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It was growing dark . I still held the belt in my hand . It was becoming wet with sweat . Then I remember fainting and remember someone slapping me . The road was bad and every jolt of the ambulance was like a knife in my foot . Then came the hospital at El Escorial , an American hospital . I asked if they had seen a young woman , a .. . " Yes . Lisa Poirer . Yes . She 's here . Brought here hours ago . " " How is she ? " " She 's all right . " " Can I see her ? " " No . She 's just had an operation . You can not see her . " They injected anti-tetanus into my arm and marked a cross on my forehead . " Shall I be able to see her in the morn-ing ? " " Yes . " " How is she ? " The nurse smiled . " I told you she was all right . She 's suffering from shock . Her side was hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . " " She needed an operation ? " " Naturally . Why do you think we gave her one ? " " I do n't know . " Dr. Walbridge came over to my stretcher . " How do you feel ? " " Good . Can I see Lisa ? " " No . I 'm afraid not . She 's suffering from shock . It would be bad for her if you saw her . " " But she and I . . . I . . . I 'm a very good friend of hers . " " Sorry . You can not possibly see her until morning . " " Could n't I just look at her ? " " No . Sorry . " The wounded men lay on the floor of the hospital in stretchers . All the beds were taken . The ambulances kept on unloading . The pain became worse . Dr. Wellbridge gave me a shot . " There now , you 'll go to sleep . " " Does she say anything ? " " She asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told me to give you her regards and not to worry . She asked for you when she came in . " My watch still showed six-thirty . I asked the time . Three-thirty A.m . I could n't sleep . A nurse came over . " What 's that ? " she asked . " That 's her belt . " ? oh. , , All night the wounded came . The doctors worked smoothly , quickly . Here ? this one . Clothes cut off . Fracture ? Abdomen ? Bring him to the theater . Take this one first . This one . Dead ? Take him away . This one . No , the other . All through the night . A Spanish boy lay beside me moaning . A nurse gave him a shot and he became quiet . " ' What time is it ? " " Five o'clock . Why do n't you sleep ? " " I ca n't sleep . Can I see her now ? " " No . " Well , I would see her soon , joke about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank after missing all the bombs and bullets in the world , and she would probably raise a fuss about losing her camera . But she 'd laugh when I 'd tell her that now I had my excuse to go to Paris with her . At five-thirty Dr. Wellbridge came to my stretcher . " Well , everything looks much better . We were frankly worried . She was badly shocked . We just gave her a blood transfusion and she said Whee , I feel good . ' She asked about her camera again and I told her it was lost . All she said was ' C'est la guerre . ' She 's really a remarkable woman . She also told me to tell you not to flirt with any of the nurses . " " Can I see her now ? " " For God 's sakes man , not now . She must sleep now . If she sleeps everything will be all right . She 's badly shocked . You 'll see her later . You must have patience . " " But she wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her hand . Please . . " " Good Godl man , do n't you think I want to let you see her ? She asked to see you too . But it 's for her own good . Believe me . " " I 'm sorry . Could you take a message for me ? Tell her that now I have my excuse to go to Paris . She 'll understand . " " If she 's awake . But I hope she sleeps . " I drank some coffee . The head nurse had not slept all night . Neither had Dr. Wellbridge or the other doctors . They were sleepy-eyed . Wellbridge passed me , smiled , and went upstairs . I saw a nurse follow him . I 'll try to sleep now , I said to myself . I suppose this is a good story . My feet do n't pain . The morphine made me feel dull and shapeless . Walbridge came toward me . " I 'm afraid that I have bad news for you . " I waited . " Lisa just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellbridge lighted the cigarette . He turned and came back with a needle . " No . I do n't need it . For Christ 's sake I do n't need it . When I need it I 'll ask for it . 1 feel no pain . " " Give me your arm . You 're going to need it . " " No . I do n't want it . " He jabbed it into my arm . " Hell ! " I wanted to ask if he were sure she was dead but I did n't . I wanted to go to sleep and forget a lot of things but I could n't . A nurse came over and told the doctor about another case . " Would you like to be taken into my room ? " he asked . " Please , if you can . " The anti-aircraft began to fire away and the shutters rattled . Wellbridge came back . " You 'll never know how sorry I am because I did n't let you see her . But I did n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hell , that 's all right . " Wel ! bridge stood in front of me and turned his face . " If you want . . . " he paused . . . " if you want you can see her now . But it is n't good to see someone dead whom you 've loved . " " Hell , I do n't want to see her now . " But I did . I did n't believe she was dead . They brought me upstairs on a stretcher and I looked at her and her face was not quite the same . Then they carried me down and I kept slipping on the stretcher and the boys carrying me told me to hold on or I should fall . Someone gave me an American cigarette . The smoke curled gracefully . Then the nurse brought me Lisa 's cigarette case . There was one cigarette left . I put out the American cigarette and smoked the one in Lisa 's case . It was a Spanish cigarette and I never liked Spanish cigarettes . The doctor asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to tell him to go to hell , but he meant well so I told him I would take it with me to Paris . Then the nurse came over and she said that she was sorry .
