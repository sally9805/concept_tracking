txt A recommendation to declare the regular quarterly dividend of 50 cents has been decided upon by the executive committee of the American Ice Co. and will be made at the directors ' meeting on Tuesday , according to Charles C. Small , president . " The unseasonably cold weather throughout the second quarter has more than offset the excellent results produced by abnormally high temperatures in the first quarter , " said Mr. Small . " The definite results for the first half year will not be known for several weeks but we anticipate a less favorable showing than was realized in the fink six months of 1981 . " As the third quarter , and more particularly July and August , are the most important contributors to earnings , we have no reason to change our expectation that earnings will substantially more than cover the common dividend requirements this year . The fact that the crop of natural ice last winter was approximately of normal and that the demand for manufactured ice will be thereby increased this summer should help earnings In the coming quarter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
