After stifling under a pall of rank smoke for three weeks , officials of a dozen east coast Florida cities met last week in Fort Lauderdale to discuss what they could do about a major catastrophe . Fires-some of them presumably started by alligator hunters burning grass around their quarry 's wallow-had swept more than 1,000,000 acres east and south of Lake Okeechobee . The burned area included 154,000 acres of rich muck and peatlands which nature was centuries in laying down and which expensive drainage systems were installed to make arable . Down through the sawgrass and palmetto flats of the Everglades the flames had roared . On both sides of the famed Tamiami Trail across the peninsula , the fire still burned . About 3,000,000 more acres were threatened . <P> Last week Executive Director John H. Baker of the National Audubon Societies surveyed by air a lifeless desert , populated only by spinning whirlwinds of sand and hot ashes , where a green wilderness used to teem with birds-ibis , herons , cranes , ducks , snowy egrets . <P> Florida 's civic fathers agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 1 ) named a permanent protective committee to look after Florida 's wilderness in future , 2 ) prayed solemnly for rain .
