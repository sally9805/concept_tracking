Last fortnight Chairman Arthur Ernest Morgan of the Tennessee Valley Authority startled Washington and the nation by demanding a full-fledged Congressional investigation of his colleagues , Harcourt Morgan and David Eli Lilienthal , in language that suggested that their great enterprise might be the Teapot Dome of the Roosevelt Administration ( TIME , March 14 ) . So last week the three TVA directors appeared in Washington for their long threatened showdown before Representatives , Senators , Capital correspondents and the President of the U. S. By week 's end the TVA family row , like the Great Boyg which oppressed Ibsen 's hero Peer Gynt , was beginning to seem a tantalizing something at once too big to ignore and too shapeless to grasp . <P> Congress . First reaction of Congress , one of stunned amazement , did not last long . Second reaction was a frantic effort by Administration leaders to forestall a muckraking committee investigation .

" I am just as anxious as any man on earth , " he shouted , " to expose any evil , if there is an evil . ... In perfect fairness I would say to the Senator I would just as lief Willkie should be on the committee as the Senator from New Hampshire . ... He hates the TVA . " Senator Norris had proposed an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission . But to many Congressmen the idea of one group of Roosevelt appointees sitting in judgment on another looked , despite the sincerity of George Norris ' intentions , too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
