So profound grew the disquiet of Pope Pius XI last week that in Vatican City he fervently exclaimed : <P> " God desires good , but He also permits evil , and our saddest thought is that it is our own sons who work evil against other good sons who are dear to us . " <P> Chief of those " sons who worked evil " fortnight ago , by charging that Azione Cattolica ( the Italian League for Catholic Action ) was busy with a Catholic plot to seize the Italian State , and who forthwith padlocked some 15,000 Catholic clubs throughout Italy ( TIME , June 8 ) , was of course Benito Mussolini . <P> In his huge , high-ceilinged Renaissance offices in the Palazzo Venezia last week , Il Duce summoned and addressed the Directorate of Fascismo . The session was secret , but a summary of what Premier Mussolini said was issued . In substance he pictured Pope Pius as surrounded by a Vatican camarilla who concealed from His Holiness every fact favorable to Fascism and furthermore concealed from the Holy Father that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duce said that proof of all he charged was in his possession - " documentary proof .

" <P> Next day Pope Pius XI exclaimed most fervently : <P> ' ' If they drive us from our home we will pray in the churches ! If they drive us from the churches we will pray in the catacombs , as our predecessors did 2,000 years ago . " <P> No Catholic was driven from his home or church in Italy last week . To dramatize the passive struggle of the Church , Pius XI suspended all open air religious services and processions . Thus on Corpus Christi Day ( which exuberant Italians have always celebrated in the street with the romp and frolic of a Mardi Gras fte ) the only Catholic observances last week were services in church .
