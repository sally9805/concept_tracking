txt After three years of exploration work , consisting of the digging of cross trenches and the sinking of about 40 diamond drill holes . Vanadium Corp . of America has blocked out a. large body of nelsonite ore in its Amherst and Nelson County properties in Virginia . The chemical plant , being erected by Stone gc Webster , is scheduled to be in operation in December or early in 1931 . Cost of construction will be in excess of $2,000,000 . Engineering work has been completed and practically all equipment has been ordered . Nelsonite is a combination of ilmenite , which is the base mineral for titanium products , and apatite , which is one of the base minerals for phosphoric acid products . The greatest present use for titanium products is in the pigment industry . Phosphate salts are used in great quantity in the baking and other industries . Unwilling to Estimate Profits The management of Vanadium is unwilling to estimate profits which it may obtain from its new undertaking . Authorities in the paint trade maintain titanium dioxide is superior to white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of titanium pigments has been due to the lack of a large supply of titanium at a reasonable price . Titanium dioxide is selling at around 22 cents to 24 cents a pound . Vanadium 's costs are sufficiently low to permit it to sell titanium oxide in competition with white lead . Vanadium officials believe there will be no waste from the mining operations , as aside from the ready marketability of the phosphate salts produced , they have found that the tailings of the mill can be used to make a low grade red iron titarthan paint which will have a ready market in the painting of structural steel work . Raw , imported ilmenite ore , which does not contain any by-products , is selling at $16 to $19 a ton , eastern seaboard . Engineers estimate that the cost of mining and milling Vanadium 's ore should not exceed $6 a ton . At present there is no tariff on the importation of foreign ilmenite in the United States . The finished product , titanium dioxide , however , is protected by a 30% ad valorem tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ilmenite are ? each sand deposits in India , Senegal and Norway . These deposits can be mined only at certain times of the year . The Indian deposits , for example , are workable only a maximum of nine months a year . During the monsoon period of three months or longer , and likevise during other storm periods , work must be suspended . Vanadium has no such problems . The big true vein deposit is approximately 400 feet wide and runs through a hill , enabling the ore to be steam shoveled and transported to the mill by gravity . Here the crude ore is crushed by ordinary methods , the ilmenite separated from the apatite and transported to the chemical plants a short distance away by conveyor 's . There will be two chemical plants , one where the apatite will be converted into phosphate salts and the other where the ilmenite will be converted into titanium products . Preparations are being made for possible expansion of the chemical plants and mill . These . plants are being built so that they can be increased in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is water power and a railroad in close proximity . More Ore Than Proven Up Vanadium undoubtedly has more ore on its properties than has been proven up . for exploratory work was stopped when sufficient ore for many years ' operations was developed . The scientific section of the American Paint E. Varnish Association recently conducted tests with white pigments and found that the tinting strength of titanium oxide for the same weight of white is 107= times that of white lead and about five times that of either zinc oxide or lithopone . The association also found that one pound of basic carbonate white lead pigment will cover , in paint brush tests . 15.3 square feet of surface , while titanium oxide will cover 56.4 square-feet a pound . Lithopone , which has had a remarkable growth in the last five years , covers only 26.3 square feet a pound of pigment . On a gallonage basis the association found that a gallon of white lead covers approximately 313 square feet , while a gallon of titanium oxide covers 581 square feet , zinc oxide 250 square feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government-on exterior work have shov. -n that when white lead and zinc pigments are mixed with pigments conaining a titanium oxide , such pigments do not crack . Present Market in United Staten At present there is a market in the United States for approximately 600,000 tons of white pigments annually . Vanadium 's chemists express the belief that there is a big field for expansion in the use of titanium products . provided costs of the latter are brought down to a basis which will make them competitive with other products , as only one coat and sometimes two will be required on buildings , as against three , four and five with other pigments . Vanadium has employed several outstanding engineers to assist its own staff of engineers in this undertaking , and data submitted on costs have indicated that markets can be developed profitably as soon as the plant goes into operation . Besides the paint trade , titanium is used in manufacture of paper , glass , porcelain , enameling dyes , textiles , leather , radio tubes and steel tires .
