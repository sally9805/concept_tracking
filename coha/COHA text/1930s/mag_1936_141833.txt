School principals have gotten into trouble for their personal habits , their political views , or for such imprudent lapses as that of Charles O'Hearn of Norwood Park , Ill. , who , his superiors charged , " could n't keep his hands off " his women teachers ( TIME , Aug. 31 ) . Until last week , however , no principal had lost his job simply for telling a bad joke . <P> Smooth-shaven , sleek Harry Jager has been head of the Providence , R. I. evening schools for 16 years , principal of big Hope High School since 1926 . Last year Principal Jager was commended by the New England College Entrance Certificate Board , which rated Hope among the nine best public schools in New England . Providence parents like Mr. Jager because he is a glib , willing after-dinner speaker . When he returned month ago from an English vacation , Hope 's Parent-Teacher Association easily persuaded him to give a speech about his trip . <P> Principal Jager wandered on happily about England and Wales , told an anecdote about an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had visited an inn whose proprietor told him that it had been used as a " nunnery " in the 14th Century . When he was excavating for a new cellar , the proprietor added , he had come upon a tunnel leading to a nearby monastery . This tale Principal Jager , a good Methodist , enthusiastically and tactlessly retold together with the innkeeper 's comment : " There was dirty work going on even then . " <P> The Parent-Teacher Association listened politely , but Principal Jager soon realized his mistake when Providence 's Roman Catholic Visitor headlined : WIDESPREAD INDIGNATION CAUSED BY VILE REMARK OF PRINCIPAL . For three weeks thereafter Principal Jager made the front page of the vindictive Visitor . Finally the Visitor ran a " Who 's Who " of Providence 's School Committee , captioned : IT 'S UP TO THEM . <P> Last week the School Committee , four of whose seven members are Catholics , held an open hearing to consider the case of Harry Jager . No complaint other than the storytelling was brought forward . Some of the 75 citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooney that Harry Jager be stripped of both his executive jobs , demoted to a teaching position . To this compromise the School Committee solemnly and unanimously assented.
