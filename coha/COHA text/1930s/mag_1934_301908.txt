With five minutes left to play and the score 6-to-6 , the biggest crowd of the year ( 80,000 ) saw Notre Dame 's Andy Pilney drop back for a pass from his own 38-yd. line . The ball sailed across the line of scrimmage in a high arc , landed in the arms of Notre Dame 's Dan Hanley who was dragged down by two tacklers on Army 's 25-yd. line . Two line plays followed and then Pilney dropped back to pass again . This time , Hanley caught the ball just beyond the line of scrimmage , cut to the left , zigzagged 10 yd. to the goalline . <P> For Hanley , an oldster of Knute Rockne 's last team who had been kept out of college by illness in 1931 and 1932 , and for a Notre Dame team that has shown flashes of greatness , that play was a satisfactory climax for the season .

Two touchdowns by Yale in the first half spoiled Harvard 's chance of winning , but made all the more dramatic two long Harvard marches which stopped inside Yale 's 5-yd. line . Yale 14 , Harvard 0 . <P> Clinching its first undisputed Big Ten title in 23 years , Minnesota 's juggernaut took no chances with Wisconsin .
