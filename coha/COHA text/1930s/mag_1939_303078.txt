Pounding south one night last week , the crack Paris-Toulouse night express sped toward sleeping Chateauroux . Outside of town , with braked wheels flaming , the express smashed into two freight cars and curled up in a heap of tortured junk , from which trapped passengers screamed for help until long after dawn . <P> The casualty list : dead , 18 ; injured , 30 . <P> The cause : a cow , which had leaped from a cattle car as the freight backed into a siding , fell beneath the wheels , derailed two cars in the path of the express .
