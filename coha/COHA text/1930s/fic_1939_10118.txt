scrambled to his feet and followed the line of the fence till he got to the driveway , the light-colored Negro just a little behind him . And when they got near the porch , Jimmy Williams stopped and took a leaf and wiped off his shoes , though he could n't have told you why . The Negro stood watching while he did it , perfectlyat ease . Jimmy Williams could see that the Negro thought better of him for wiping off his shoes , but not much . And that made him mad , and he wanted to say , " I 'm no white trash . My father 's a doctor , " but he knew better than to say it . He just wiped his shoes and the Negro stood and waited . Then the Negro took him around to the side porch , and there was Old Man Cappalow , sitting in his cane chair . " White boy here , Marse John , " said the Negro in his low , sweet voice . The old man lifted his head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long stare and it went to Jimmy Williams ' backbone . " Sit down , boy , " he said , at last , and his voice was friendly enough , but Jimmy Williams obeyed it . " You can go along , Sam , " he said , and Jimmy Williams sat on the edge of a cane chair and tried to feel comfortable . He did n't do very well at it , but he tried . " What 's your name , boy ? " said the old man , after a while . " Jimmy Williams , sir , " said Jimmy Williams . " I mean James Williams , Junior , sir . " " Williams , " said the old man , and his black eyes glowed . " There was a Colonel Williams with the SixtyfilthVirginia  --  or was it the Sixty-third ? He came fromp101Fairfax County and was quite of my opinion that we should have kept to primogeniture , in spite of Thomas Jefferson . But I doubt if you are kin . " " No , sir , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ninth Georgia . And he was a private . They were aiming to make him a corporal , he says , but they never got around to it . But he fit  --  he fought lots of Yankees . He fit tons of ' em . And I 've seen his uniform . But now he 's a doctor instead . " The old man seemed to look a little queer at that . " A doctor ? " he said . " Well , some very reputable gentlemenhave practiced medicine . There need be no loss of standing . " " Yes , sir , " said Jimmy Williams . Then he could n't keep it back any longer : " Please , sir , were you ever clawed by the devil ? " he said . " Ha-hrrm ! " said the old man , looking startled . " You 're a queer boy . And suppose I told you I had been ? " " I 'd believe you , " said Jimmy Williams , and the old man laughed . He did it as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clawed by the devil ! " he said . " Ha-hrrm ! You 're a bold boy . I did n't know they grew them nowadays . I 'm surprised . " But he did n't look angry , as Jimmy Williams had expected him to . " Well , " said jimmy Williams , " if you had been , I thought maybe you 'd tell me about it . I 'd be right interested . Or maybe let me see the clawmarks . I mean , if they 're there . " " I ca n't show you those , " said the old man , " though they 're deep and wide . " And he stared fiercely at Jimmy Williams . " But you were n't afraid to come here and you wiped your shoes when you came . So I 'll show you something else . " He rose and was tall . " Come into the house , " he said . So Jimmy Williams got up and went into the house with him . It was a big , cool , dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see much at first . But then his eyes began to get used to the dimness . Well , there were plenty of houses in Shady where the rooms were cool and dim and the sword hung over the mantelpiece and the furniture was worn and old . It was n't that made the difference . But stepping into this house was somehow like stepping back into the past , though Jimmy Williams could n't have put it that way . He just knew it was full of beautiful things and grand things that did n't quite fit it , and yet all belongedtogether . And they knew they were grand and stately , and yet there was dust in the air and a shadow on the wall . It was peaceful enough and handsome enough , yet it did n't make Jimmy Williams feel comfortable , though he could n't have told you why . " Well , " said the old man , moving about among shadows , " how do you like it , Mr. Williams ? " " It 's  --  I never saw anything like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased . " Touch the things , boy , " he said . " Touch the things . They do n't mind beingtouched . " So Jimmy Williams went around the room , staring at the miniatures and the pictures , and picking up onep103thing or another and putting it down . He was very careful and he did n't break anything . And there were some wonderful things . There was a game of chess on a table  --  carved-ivory pieces  --  a game that people had started , but had n't finished . He did n't touch those , though he wanted to , because he felt the people might not like it when they came back to finish their game . And yet , at the same time , he felt that if they ever did come back , they 'd be dead , and that made him feel queerer . There were silver-mounted pistols , long-barreled , on a desk by a big silver inkwell ; there was a quill pen made of a heron 's feather , and a silver sandboxbeside it  --  there were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of a big , tall clock . " I 'm sorry , sir , " he said , " but I do n't think that 's the right time . " " Oh , yes , it is. " said the old man . " It 's always the right time . " " Yes , sir , " said Jimmy Williams , " but it is n't run-ning . " " Of course not , " said the old man . " They say you ca n't put the clock back , but you can . I 've put it back and I mean to keep it back . The others can do as they please . I warned them  --  I warned them in 1850 , when they accepted the Compromise . I warned them there could be no compromise . Well , they would not be warned . " " Was that bad of them , sir ? " asked Jimmy Williams . " It was misguided of them , " said the old man . " Misguidedof them all . " He seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help listening . " There can be no compromise with one 's glass or one 's breeding or one 's sentiments , " the old man said . " Afterwards  --  well , there were gentlemen I knew who went to Guatemala or elsewhere . I do not blame them for it . But mine is another course . " He paused and glanced at the clock . Then he spoke in a different voice . " I beg your pardon , " he said . " I fear I was growing heated . You will excuse me . I generally take some refreshment around this time in the afternoon . Perhaps you will join me , Mr. Williams ? " It did n't seem to Jimmy Williams as if the silver hand bell in the old man 's hand had even stopped ringingbefore the Negro , Sam , came in with a tray . He had a queer kind of old-fashioned long coat on now , and a queer old-fashioned cravat , but his pants were the pants of his blue jeans . Jimmy Williams noticed that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " he said , " there are many traitors . Men I held in the greatest esteem have betrayed their class and their system . They have accepted ruin and domination in the name of advancement . But we will not speak of them now . " He took the frosted silver cup from the tray and motioned to Jimmy Williams that the small fluted glass was for him . " I shall ask you to rise , Mr. Williams , " he said . " We shall drink a toast . " He paused for a moment , standing straight . " To the Confederate States of America and damnation to all her enemies ! " lie said . Jimmy Williams drank . He 'd never drunk any wine before , except blackberry cordial , and this wine seemedp105to him powerfully thin and sour . But he felt grown up as he drank it , and that was a fine feeling . " Every night of my life , " said the old man , " I drink that toast . And usually I drink it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams . " " Yes , sir , " said Jimmy Williams , but all the same , he felt queer . For drinking the toast , somehow , had been very solemn , almost like being in church . But in church you did n't exactly pray for other people 's damnation , though the preacher might get right excited over sin . Well , then the two of them sat down again , and Old Man Cappalow began to talk of the great plantation days and the world as it used to be . Of course , Jimmy Williams had heard plenty of talk of that sort . But this was different . For the old man talked of those days as if they were still going on , not as if they were past . And as he talked , the whole room seemed to join in , with a thousand , sighing , small voices , stately and clear , till Jimmy Williams did n't know whether he was on his head or his heels and it seemed quite natural to him to look at the fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dated " June 14 , 1859 " instead of " June 14 , 1897 . " Well , maybe it was the wine , though he 'd only had a thimbleful . But when Jimmy Williams went out into the sun again , he felt changed , and excitedtoo . For he knew about Old Man Cappalow now , and he was just about the grandest person in the world . The Negro went a little behind him , all the way to the gate , on soft feet . When they got there , the Negro opened the gate and spoke.  | " Young marster , " he said , " I do n't know why Marse john took in his head to ask you up to the house . But we lives private , me and Marse John . We lives very private . " There was a curious pleading in his voice . " I do n't tell tales , " said Jimmy Williams , and kicked at the fence . " Yes , sir , " said the Negro , and he seemed relieved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that . But we'se living very private till the big folks come back . We do n't want no tales spread before . And then we'se going back to Otranto , the way we should . " " I know about Otranto . He told me , " said Jimmy Williams , catching his breath . " Otranto Marse John 's plantation in Verginny , " said the Negro , as if he had n't heard . " He owns the river and the valley , the streams and the hills . We got four hundred field hands at Otranto and stables for sixty horses . But we ca n't go back there till the big folks come back . Marse John say so , and he always speak the truth . But they 's goin ' to come back , a-shootin ' and pirootin ' , they pistols at they sides . And every day I irons his Richmond paper for him and he reads about the old times . We got boxes and boxes of papers down in the cellar . " He paused . " And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be so , " he said . Again his voice held that curious pleading . " You remember , young marster , " he said . " You remember , white boy . " " I told you I did n't tell tales , " said Jimmy Williams . But after that , things were different for him . Because there 's one thing about a boy that age that most grown people forget . A boy that age can keep a secret in a wayp107that 's perfectly astonishing . And he can go through queer hells and heavens you 'll never hear a word about , not even if you got him or bore him . It was that way with Jimmy Williams ; it might n't have been for another boy . It began like a game , and then it stopped being a game . For , of course , he went back to Old Man Cappalow 's . And the Negro , Sam , would show him up to the house and he 'd sit in the dim room with the old man and drink the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man Cappalow any more ; it was Col. John Leonidas Cappalow , who 'd raised and equipped his own regiment and never surrendered . Only , when the time was ripe , he was going back to Otranto , and the old days would bloom again , and Jimmy Williams would be part of them . When he shut his eyes at night , he could see Otranto and its porches , above the rolling river , great and stately ; he could hear the sixty horses stamping in their stalls . He could see the pretty girls , in their wide skirts , coming down the glassy , proud staircases ; he could see the fine , handsome gentlemen who ruled the earth and the richness of it without a thought of care . It was all like a storybook to Jimmy Williams  --  a storybook come true . And more than anything he 'd ever wanted in his life , he wanted to be part of it . The only thing was , it was hard to fit the people he really knew into the story . Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in Shady who was worthy of being trusted with the secret . Well , there were plenty of boys like Bob Miller and Tommy Vine , but somehow you could n't see them inp108the dim room . They 'd fit in , all right , when the great clays came back  --  they 'd have to  --  but meanwhile  --  well , they might just take it for a tale . And then there was Carrie , the cook . She 'd have to be a slave again , of course , and though Jimmy Williams did n't imagine that she 'd mind , now and then he had just a suspicion that she might . He did n't ask her about it , but he had the suspicion . It was even hard to fit Jimmy 's father in , with his little black bag and his rumpled clothes and his laugh . Jimmy could n't quite see his father going up the front steps of Otranto  --  not because he was n't a gentleman or grand enough , but because it just did n't happen to be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really hate anybody , as far as Jimmy knew . But you had to hate people a good deal , if you wanted to follow ColonelCappalow . You had to shoot at the mark and feel you were really shooting the enemy 's colors down . You had to believe that even people like General Lee had been wrong , bcause they had n't held out in the mountainsand fought till everybody died . Well , it was hard to believe a wrong thing of General Lee , and Jimmy Williams did n't quite manage it . He was willing to hate the Yankees and the Republicans  --  hate them hot and hard  --  but there were n't any of them in Shady . Well , come to think of it , there was Mr. Rosen , at the drygoodsstore , and Mr. Ailey , at the mill . They did n't look very terrible and he was used to them , but he tried to hate them all he could . He got hold of the Rosen boy one day and rocked him home , but the Rosen boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd ever seen ap109real live Republican , with horns and a tail , he 'd have clone him a mortal injury  --  he felt sure he would . And so the summer passed , and by the end of the summer Jimmy did n't feet quite sure which was real  --  the times now or the times Colonel Cappalow talked about . For he 'd dream about Otranto at night and think of it during the day . He 'd ride back there on a black horse , at Colonel Cappalow 's left , and his saber would be long and shining . But if there was a change in him , there was a change in Colonel Cappalow too . He was a lot more excitable than he used to be , and when he talked to Jimmy sometimes , he 'd call him by other names , and when he shot at the mark with the enemy 's colors on it , his eyes would blaze . So by that , and by the news he read out of the old papers , Jimmy suddenly got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the treasure all waiting , and soon they 'd be ready to rise . And Colonel Cappalow filled out Jimmy Williams ' commission as captain in the army of the New ConfederateStates of America and presented it to him , with a speech . Jimmy Williams felt very proud of that commission , and hid it under a loose brick in his fireplace h i coney , where it would be safe . Well , then it came to the plans , and when Jimmy Williams first heard about them , he felt a little surprised . There were maps spread all over the big desk in the dim room now , and Colonel Cappalow moved pins and showed Jimmy strategy . And that was very exciting , and like a game . But first of all , they 'd have to give a signal and strike a blow . You had to do that first , and then the country would rise . Well , Jimmy Williams could see the reason in that . They were going into Shady and capture the post office first , and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad bridge to stop the trains , and Colonel Cappalow would read a proclamation from the steps of the courthouse . The only part Jimmy Williamsdid n't like about it was killing the postmaster and the station agent , in case they resisted . Jimmy Williams felt pretty sure they would resist , particularly the stationagent , who was a mean customer . And , somehow , killing people you knew was n't quite like killing Yankees and Republicans . The thought of it shook something in Jimmy 's mind and made it waver . But after that they 'd march on Washington , and everything would be all right . All the same , he 'd sworn his oath and he was a commissionedofficer in the army of the New Confederate States . So , when Colonel Cappalow gave him the pistol that morning , with the bullets and the powder , and explain how he was to keep watch at the door of the post office and shoot to kill if he had to , Jimmy said , " I shall execute the order , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd go for the station agent and he 'd have a chance for a lot more shooting . And it was all going to be for noon the next day . Somehow , Jimmy Williams could n't quite believe it was going to be for noon the next day , even when he was loading the pistol in the woodshed of the Williams house , late that afternoon . And yet he saw , with a kind of horrible distinctness , that it was going to be . It mightp111sound crazy to some , but not to him  --  Colonel Cappalowwas a sure shot ; he 'd seen him shoot at the mark . He could see him shooting , now , and he wondered if a bullet went " whang " when it hit a man . And , just as he was fumbling with the bullets , the woodshed door opened suddenly and there was his father . Well , naturally , Jimmy dropped the pistol and jumped . The pistol did n't explode , for he 'd forgotten it needed a cap . But with that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time he 'd really been afraid and ashamed in front of his father , and now he was ashamed and afraid . And then it was like waking up out of an illness , for his lather saw his white face and said , " What 's the matter , son ? " and the words began to come out of his mouth . " Take it easy , son , " said his father , but Jimmy could n't take it easy . He told all about Otranto and Old Man Cappalow and hating the Yankees and killing the postmaster , all jumbled up and higgledy-piggledy . But Doctor Williams made sense of it . At first he smiled a little as he listened , but after a while he stopped smiling , and there was anger in his face . And when jimmy was quite through , " Well , son , " he said , " I reckon we 've let you run wild . But I never thought . . . " He asked Jimmy a few quick questions , mostly about the dynamite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to get it from the men who were blasting for the new spur track . " And now , son , " he said , " when did you say this massacre was going to start ? " " Twelve o'clock at the post office . " said Jimmy.  | " But we were n't going to massacre . It was just the folks t hat resisted  --  " Doctor Williams made a sound in his throat . " Well , " he said , " you and I are going to take a ride in the coun- i try , Jimmy . No , we wo n't tell your mother , I think . " It was the last time Jimmy Williams went out to Old Man Cappalow 's , and he remembered that . His father did n't say a word all the way , but once he felt in his back pocket for something he 'd taken out of the drawer of his desk , and Jimmy remembered that too . When they drove up in front of the house , his father gave the reins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I 'll settle this . " Then he got out of the buggy , a little awkwardly , for he was a heavy man , and Jimmy heard his feet scrunch on the gravel . Jimmy knew again , as he saw him go up the steps , that he would n't have fitted in Otranto , and somehow he was glad . The Negro , Sam , opened the door . " Tell Colonel Cappalow Doctor Williams wishes to speak with him , " said Jimmy 's father , and Jimmy could see that his father 's neck was red . " Colonel Cappalow not receivin ' , " said Sam , in his light sweet voice , but Jimmy 's father spoke again . " Tell Colonel Cappalow , " he said . He did n't raise his voice , but there was something in it that Jimmy had never heard in that voice before . Sam looked for a moment and went inside the house . Then Colonel Cappalow came to the door himself . There was red from the evening sun on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked tall and proud . Hep113looked first at Jimmy 's father and then at Jimmy . And his voice said , quite coldly , and reasonably and clearly , Traitor ! All traitors ! " " You 'll oblige me by leaving the boy out of it , " said Jimmy 's father heavily . " This is 1897 , sir , not I 86o , " al Id for a moment there was something light and heady and dangerous in the air between them . Jimmy knew what his father had in his pocket then , and he sat stiff in the buggy and prayed for time to change and things to go away . Then Colonel Cappalow put his hand to his forehead . " I beg your pardon , sir , " he said , in an altered voice . " You mentioned a date ? " " I said it was 1897 , " said Doctor Williams , standing square and stocky , " I said Marse Robert 's dead  --  God bless him !  --  and Jefferson Davis too . And before he died , Marse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies can keep up the war as long as they see fit  --  that 's their privilege . But men ought to act like men . " He stared for a moment at the high-chinned , sculpturalface . " Why , damn your soul ! " he said , and it was less an oath than a prayer . " I was with the Ninth Georgia ; I went through three campaigns . We fought till the day of Appomattox and it was we-uns ' fight . " Something tough and from the past had slipped back into his speech  --  something , too , that Jimmy Williams had never heard in it before . " We did n't own niggers or plantations  --  the men I fought with . But when it was over , we reckoned it was over and we 'd build up the land . Well , we 've had a hard time to do it , but we're hoeing corn . We 've got something better to do than fill up a boy with a lot of magnolious notions and aim to shoot up a postmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and again it was less an oath than a prayer , " it was bad enough getting licked when you thought you could n't be  --  but when I look at you  --  well , hate stinks when it 's kept too long in the barrel , no matter how you dress it up and talk fine about it . I 'm warning you . You keep your hands off my boy . Now , that 's enough . " " Traitors , " said the old man vaguely , " all traitors . " Then a change came over his face and he stumbled forward as if he had stumbled over a stone . The Negro and the white man both sprang to him , but it was the Negro who caught him and lowered him to the ground . Then Jimmy Williams heard his father calling for his black bag , and his limbs were able to move again . Doctor Williams came out of the bedroom , drying his hands on a towel . His eyes fell upon Jimmy Williams , crouched in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " At least  --  he 's not all right . But he was n't in pain . " Jimmy Williams shivered a little . " I heard him talking , " he said difficultly . " I heard him calling people things . " " Yes , " said his father . " Well , you must n't think too much of that . You see , a man  --  " He stopped and beganagain , " Well , I 've no doubt he was considerable of a man once . Only  --  well , there 's a Frenchman calls it a fixed idea . You let it get a hold of you . . . and thep115way he was brought up . He got it in his head , you see  --  he could n't stand it that he might have been wrong about anything . And the hate  --  well , it 's not for a man . Not when it 's like that . Now , where 's that Nigra ? " Jimmy Williams shivered again ; he did not want Sam back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the Negro answer , politely . " H 'm , " said Doctor Williams . " Twice before . He should have had medical attention . " " Marse John do n't believe in doctors , " said the low , sweet voice . " He would n't , " said Doctor Williams briefly . " Well , I 'll take the boy home now . But I 'll have to come back . I 'm coroner for this county . You understand about that ? " " Yes , sir , " said the low , sweet voice , " I understand about that . " Then the Negro looked at the doctor . " Marse Williams , " he said , " I would n't have let hint do it . Ile thought he was bound to . But I would n't have let him do it . " " Well , " said the doctor . He thought , and again said , " Well . " Then he said , " Are there any relatives ? " " I take him back to Otranto , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but Marse John got a right to lie there . That 's Verginny law , he told me . " " So it is , " said the doctor . " I 'd forgotten that . " " He do n't want no relatives , " said the Negro . " He got nephews and nieces and all sorts of kin . But they went against him and he cut them right out of his mind . He do n't want no relatives . " He paused . " He cut everything out of his mind but the old days , " he said.  | " He start doing it right after the war . That 's why we come here . He do n't want no part nor portion of the present days . And they send him money from Verginuy , but he only spend it the one way  --  except when we buy this place . " He smiled as if at a secret . " But how ? " said the doctor , staring at furniture and pictures . " Jus ' one muleload from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'd like to see anybody cross Marse John in the old days . " He coughed . " They 's just one thing , Marse Williams , " he said , in his suave voice . " I ai n't skeered of sittin ' up with Marse John . I always been with him . But it 's the money . " " What money ? " said Doctor Williams . " Well , that will go through the courts  --  " " No , sir , " said the Negro patiently . " I mean Marse John 's special money that he spend the other money for . He got close to a millyum dollars in that blind closet under the stairs . And nobody dare come for it , as long as he 's strong and spry . But now I do n't know . I do n't know . " " Well , " said Doctor Williams , receiving the incrediblefact , " I suppose we 'd better see . " It was as the Negro had said  --  a blind closet under the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millyum dollars , " said the Negro as the door swung back . He held the cheap glass lamp high  --  the wide roomy closet was piled from floor to ceiling with stacks of printed paper . " H 'm , " said Doctor Williams . " Yes , I thought so .... Have you ever seen a million dollars , son ? "  | " No , sir , " said Jimmy Williams . " Well , take a look , " said his father . He slipped a note from a packet , and held it under the lamp . " It says ' One Thousand Dollars , ' " said Jimmy Williams . " Oh ! " " Yes , " said his father gently . " And it also says ' ConfederateStates of America ' . . . . You do n't need to worry , Sam . The money 's perfectly safe . Nobody will come for it . Except , maybe , museums . " " Yes , Marse Williams , " said Sam unquestioningly , accepting the white man 's word , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the closet . On his way out , the doctor paused for a moment and looked at the Negro . He might have been thinking aloud  --  it seemed that way to Jimmy Williams . " And why did you do it ? " he said . " Well , that 's something we 'll never know . And what are you going to do , once you 've taken him back to Otranto ? " " I got my arrangements , thank you , sir , " said the Negro . " I have n't a doubt of it , " said Jimmy Williams ' father . " But I wish I knew what they were . " " I got my arrangements , gentlemen , " the Negro repeated , in his low , sweet voice . Then they left him , holding the lamp , with his tall shadow behind him . " Maybe I ought n't to have left him , " said Jimmy Williams ' father , after a while , as the buggy jogged along . " He 's perfectly capable of setting fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a funeral pyre . And tu.tyht ' that would n't be a bad thing , " he added , afterp118a pause . Then he said , " Did you notice the chessmen ? I wonder who played that game . It was stopped in the middle . " Then , after a while , he said , " I remember the smell of the burning woods in the Wilderness . And I remember Reconstruction . But Marse Robert was right , all the same . You ca n't go back to the past . And hate 's the most expensive commodity in the world . It 's never been anything else , and I 've seen a lot of it . We 've got to realize that  --  got too much of it , still , as a nation . " But Jimmy Williams was hardly listening . He was thinking it was good to be alone with his father in a buggy at night and good they did n't have to live in Otranto after all.  |p119DOC  MELLHORN AND THE PEARLYGATES DOC MELLHORN had never expected to go anywhereat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself on the road again , it surprised him . But perhaps I 'd better explain a little about Doc Mellhorn first . He was seventy-odd when he left our town ; but when he came , he was as young as Bates or Filsinger or any of the boys at the hospital . Only there was n't any hospital when he came . He came with a young man 's beard and a brand-new bag and a lot of newfangled ideas about medicine that we did n't take to much . And he left , forty-odd years later , with a first-class county health record and a lot of people alive that would n't have been alive if he had n't been there . Yes , a country doctor . And nobody ever called him a man in white or a death grappler that I know of , though they did think of giving him a degree at Pewauket College once . But then the board met again and decided they needed a new gymnasium , so they gave the degree to J. Prentiss Parmalee instead . They say he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin young man with an Eastern accent who 'd wanted to study in Vienna . But most of us remember him chunky and solid , with white hair and a little bald spot that always got burned bright red in the first hot weather . He had about four card tricks that he 'd do for you , if you were a youngster  --  they were always the same ones  --  and now and then , if he felt like it , he 'd take a silver half dollar out of the back of your neck . And that worked as well with the youngsters who were going to build rocket ships as it had with the youngsters who were going to be railway engineers . It always worked . I guess it was Doc Mellhorn more than the trick . But there was n't anything unusual about him , exceptmaybe the card tricks . Or , anyway , he did n't think so . He was just a good doctor and he knew us inside out . I 've heard people call him a pigheaded , obstinate old mule  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 've heard a weepy old lady call him a saint . I took the tale to him once , and he looked at me over his glasses and said , " Well , I 've always respected a mule . Got ten times the sense of a  --  horse . " Then he took a silver half dollar out of my ear . Well , how do you describe a man like that ? You do n't  --  you call him up at three in the morning . And when he sends in his bill , you think it 's a little steep . All the same , when it came to it , there were people who drove a hundred and fifty miles to the funeral . And the Masons came down from Bluff City , and the Poles came from across the tracks , with a wreath the size of a house , and you saw cars in town that you did n't often see there . But it was after the funeral that the queer things began for Doc Mellhorn . The last thing he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , on the whole , but glad for thep121test . And now he was driving his Model T down a long straight road between rolling , misty prairies that seemed to go from nowhere to nowhere . It did n't seem funny to him to be driving the Model C again . That was the car he 'd learned on , and he kept to it till his family made him change . And it did n't seem funny to him not to be sick any more . He had n't had much time to be sick in his life  --  the patients usuallyattended to that . He looked around for his bag , first thing , but it was there on the seat beside him . It was the old bag , not the presentation one they 'd given him at the hospital , but that was all right too . It meant he was out on a call and , if he could n't quite recollect at the moment just where the call was , it was certain to come to him . He 'd wakened up often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found the horse was taking him home , without his doing much about it . A doctor gets used to things like that . All the same , when he 'd driven and driven for some time without raising so much as a traffic light , just the same rolling prairies on either hand , he began to get a little suspicious . He thought , for a while , of stopping the car and getting out , just to take a look around , but he 'd always hated to lose time on a call . Then he noticedsomething else . He was driving without his glasses . And yet he had n't driven without his glasses in fifteen years . " H 'm , " said Doc Mellhorn . " I 'm crazy as a June bug . Or else  --  Well , it might be so , I suppose . " But this time he did stop the car . He opened his bag and looked inside it , but everything seemed to be in order . He opened his wallet and looked at that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he recognized them . He took his pulse , but it felt perfectlysteady . " H 'm , " said Doc Mellhorn . " Well . " Then , just to prove that everything was perfectly normal , he took a silver half dollar out of the steering wheel of the car . " Never did it smoother , " said Doc Mellhorn . " Well , all the same , if this is the new highway , it 's longer than I remember it . " But just then a motorcycle came roaring down the road and stopped with a flourish , the way motor cops do . " Any trouble ? " said the motor cop . Doc Mellhorn could n't see his face for his goggles , but the goggles looked normal . " I am a physician , " said Doc Mellhorn , as he 'd said a thousand times before to all sorts of people , " on my way to an urgent case . " He passed his hand across his forehead . " Is this the right road ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cop . " They 're expecting you , Doctor Mellhorn . Shall I give you an escort ? " " No ; thanks all the same , " said Doc Mellhorn , and the motor cop roared away . The Model T ground as Doc Mellhorn gassed her . " Well , they 've got a new breed of traffic cop , " said Doc Mellhorn , " or else  --  " But when he got to the light , it was just like any light at a crossroads . He waited till it changed and the officer waved him on . There seemed to be a good dealp123of traffic going the other way , but he did n't get a chance to notice it much , because Lizzie bucked a little , as she usually did when you kept her waiting . Still , the sight of traffic relieved him , though he had n't passed anybody on his own road yet . Pretty soon he noticed the look of the country had t Fanged . It was parkway now and very nicely lands ( aped . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink against the green ; though , as Doc Mellhornremembered it , it had been August when he left his house . And every now and then there 'd be a nice little white-painted sign that said TO THE GATES . " H 'm , " said Doc Mellhorn . " New State Parkway , I guess . Well , they 've fixed it up pretty . But I wonder where they got the dogwood . Have n't seen it bloom like that since I was East . " Then he drove along in a sort of dream for a while , for the dogwood reminded him of the days when he was .1 young man in an Eastern college . He remembered the look of that college and the girls who 'd come to dances , the girls who wore white gloves and had rolls of hair . They were pretty girls , too , and he wondered what had become of them . " Had babies , I guess , " thought Doc Mcllhorn . " Or some of them , anyway . " But he liked to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just pretty , and excited at being at a dance . I le remembered other things too  --  the hacked desks in the lecture rooms , and the trees on the campus , and the first pipe he 'd ever broken in , and a fellow called Paisley Grew that he had n't thought of in years  --  a rawboned fellow with a gift for tall stories and playing the jew's-harp . " Ought to have looked up Paisley , " he said . " Yes , I ought . Did n't amount to a hill of beans , I guess , but I always liked him . I wonder if he still plays the jew'sharp . Pshaw , I know he 's been dead twenty years . " He was passing other cars now and other cars were passing him , but he did n't pay much attention , except when he happened to notice a license you did n't often see in the state , like Rhode Island or Mississippi . He was too full of his own thoughts . There were foot passengers , too , plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a load of hay . He wondered what the man would do with the hay when he got to the Gates . But probably there were arrangements for that . " Not that I believe a word of it , " he said , " but it 'll surprise Father Kelly . Or maybe it wo n't . I used to have some handsome arguments with that man , but I always knew I could count on him , in spite of me being a heretic . " Then he saw the Wall and the Gates , right across the valley . He saw them , and they reached to the top of the sky . He rubbed his eyes for a while , but they kept on being there . " Quite a sight , " said Doc Mellhorn . No one told him just where to go or how to act , but it seemed to him that he knew . If he 'd thought about it , he 'd have said that you waited in line , but there was n't any waiting in line . He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk knew his name right away.  | " Yes , Doctor Mellhorn , " he said . " And now , what would you like to do first ? " " I think I 'd like to sit down , " said Doc Mellhorn . So he sat , and it was a comfortable chair . He even bounced the springs of it once or twice , till he caught the reception clerk 's eye on him . " Is there anything I can get you ? " said the reception clerk . He was young and brisk and neat as a pin , and you could see he aimed to give service and studied about it . Doc Mellhorn thought , " He 's the kind that wipes off your windshield no matter how clean it is . " " No , " said Doc Mellhorn . " You see , I do n't believe this . I do n't believe any of it . I 'm sorry if that sounds cranky , but I do n't . " " That 's quite all right , sir , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he smiled as if Doc Mellhornhad done him a favor . " Young man , I 'm a physician , " said Doc Mellhorn , " and do you mean to tell me  --  " Then he stopped , for he suddenly saw there was no use arguing . He was either there or he was n't . And it felt as if he were there . " Well , " said Doc Mellhorn , with a sigh , " how do I begin ? " " That 's entirely at your own volition , sir , " said thereception clerk briskly . " Any meetings with relatives , ofcourse . Or if you would prefer to get yourself settledfirst . Or take a tour , alone or conducted . Perhaps thesewill offer suggestions , " and he started to hand over ahandful of leaflets . But Doc Mellhorn put them aside . " Wait a minute , " he said . " I want to think . Well ,  | naturally , there 's Mother and Dad . But I could n't see them just yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , if I saw Grandma  --  and me older than she is  --  was  --  used to be  --  well , I do n't know what it would do to me . You 've got to let me get my breath . Well , of course , there 's Uncle Frank  --  he 'd be easier . " He paused . " Is he here ? " he said . The reception clerk looked in a file . " I am happy to say that Mr. Francis V. Mellhorn arrived July 12 , 1907 , " he said . He smiled winningly . " Well ! " said Doc Mellhorn . " Uncle Frank ! Well , I 'll be  --  well ! But it must have been a great consolation to Mother . We heard  --  well , never mind what we heard  --  I guess it was n't so . . . . No , do n't reach for that phone just yet , or whatever it is . I 'm still thinking . " " We sometimes find , " said the reception clerk eagerly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best introduction . Even a stranger sometimes  --  a distinguished stranger connected with one 's own profession  --  " " Well , now , that 's an idea , " said Doc Mellhorn heartily , trying to keep his mind off how much he dislikedthe reception clerk . He could n't just say why he disliked him , but he knew he did . It reminded him of the time he 'd had to have his gall bladder out in the city hospital and the young , brisk interns had come to see him and called him " Doctor " every other word . " Yes , that 's an idea , " he said . He reflected . " Well , of course , I 'd like to see Koch , " he said . " And Semmelweiss . Not to speak of Walter Reed . But , shucks , they'dp127be busy men . But there is one fellow  --  only he lived pretty far back  --  " " Hppocrates , please , " said the reception clerk into the telephone or whatever it was . " H for horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently . " Excuse me , but you just wait a minute . I mean if you can wait . I mean , if Hippocrates wants to come , I 've no objection . ! tut I never took much of a fancy to him , in spite of his oath . It 's Aesculapius I 'm thinking about . George W. 011 , glory ! " he said . " But he wo n't talk English . I forgot . " " I shall be happy to act as interpreter , " said the reception clerk , smiling brilliantly . " I have n't a doubt , " said Doc Mellhorn . " But just wait a shake . " In a minute , by the way the clerk was acting , he was going to be talking to Aesculapius . " And what in time am I going to say to the man ? " he thought . " It 's too much . " He gazed wildly around the neat receptionroom  --  distempered , as he noticed , in a warm shade of golden tan . Then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet and a sudden warm wave of relief flooded over him . " Wait a minute , " he said , and his voice gathered force and authority . " Where 's my patient ? " " Patient ? " said the reception clerk , looking puzzled for the first time . " Patient , " said Doc Mellhorn . " P for phlebitis . " He tapped his bag . " I 'm afraid you do n't quite understand , sir , " said the reception clerk . " I understand this , " said Doc Mellhorn . " I was called here . And if I was n't called professionally , why have I got my bag ? " " But , my dear Doctor Mellhorn  --  " said the receptionclerk . " I 'm not your dear doctor , " said Doc Mellhorn . " I was called here , I tell you . I 'm sorry not to give you the patient 's name , but the call must have come in my absence and the girl does n't spell very well . But in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the reception clerk , and his hair was n't slick any more , " nobody 's ill here . Nobody can be ill . If they could , it would n't be He  --  " " Humph , " said Doc Mellhorn . He thought it over , and felt worse . " Then what does a fellow like Koch do ? " he said . " Or Pasteur ? " He raised a hand . " Oh , do n't tell me , " he said . " I can see they 'd be busy . Yes , I guess it 'd be all right for a research man . But I never was . . . Oh , well , shucks , I 've published a few papers . And there 's that clamp of mine  --  always meant to do something about it . But they 've got better ones now . Mean to say there is n't so much as a case of mumps in the whole place ? " " I assure you , " said the reception clerk , in a weary voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Funny , " said Doc Mellhorn . " Lord knows there 's plenty of times you 'd be glad to be quit of the whole thing . And do n't talk to me about the healer 's art or grateful patients . Well , I 've known a few . . . a few . But I 've known others . All the same , it 's different , being told there is n't any need for what you can do . "  | " A for Ararat , " said the reception clerk into his instrument . " E for Eden . " " Should think you 'd have a dial , " said Doc Mellhorn desperately . " We 've got ' em down below . " He thought hard and frantically . " Wait a shake . It 's coming back to me , " he said . " Got anybody named Grew here ? Paisley Grew ? " " S for serpent . . . " said the reception clerk . " What was that ? " " Fellow that called me , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I will consult the index , " said the reception clerk . He did so , and Doc Mellhorn waited , hoping against hope . " We have 94,183 Grews , including 83 Prescotts and one Penobscot , " the reception clerk said at last . " But I fail to find Paisley Grew . Are you quite sure of the name ? " " Of course , " said Doc Mellhorn briskly . " Paisley Grew . Chronic indigestion . Might be appendix  --  ca n't say  --  have to see . But anyhow , he 's called . " He picked up his bag . " Well , thanks for the information , " he said , liking the reception clerk better than he had yet . " Not your fault , anyway . " " But  --  but where are you going ? " said the reception clerk . " Well , there 's another establishment , is n't there ? " said Doc Mellhorn . " Always heard there was . Call probablycame from there . Crossed wires , I expect . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception clerk . " I mean  --  "  | " Ca n't go ? " said Doc Mellhorn . " I 'm a physician . A patient 's called me . " " But if you 'll only wait and see Aesculapius ! " said the reception clerk , running his hands wildly through his hair . " He 'll be here almost any moment . " " Please give him my apologies , " said Doc Mellhorn . " He 's a doctor . He 'll understand . And if any messages come for me , just stick them on the spike . Do I need a road map ? Noticed the road I came was all one way . " " There is , I believe , a back road in rather bad repair , " said the reception clerk icily . " I can call Informationif you wish . " " Oh , do n't bother , " said Doc Mellhorn . " I 'll find it . And I never saw a road beat Lizzie yet . " He took a silverhalf dollar from the doorknob of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Slick as a whistle . Well , good-by , young man . " But it was n't till he 'd cranked up Lizzie and was on his way that Doc Mellhorn really felt safe . He found the back road and it was all the reception clerk had said it was and more . But he did n't mind  --  in fact , after one particularly bad rut , he grinned . " I suppose I ought to have seen the folks , " he said . " Yes , I know I ought . But  --  not so much as a case of mumps in the whole abiding dominion ! Well , it 's lucky I took a chance on Paisley Grew . " After another mile or so , he grinned again . " And I 'd like to see old Aesculapius ' face . Probably rang him in the middle of dinner  --  they always do . But shucks , it 's happened to all of us . " Well , the road got worse and worse and the skyp131above it darker and darker , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad enough when he got to the other gates . They were pretty impressive gates , too , though of course in a different way , and reminded Doc Mellhorn a little of the furnaces outside Steeltown , where he 'd practiced for a year when he was young . This time Doc Mellhorn was n't going to take any advice from reception clerks and he had his story all ready . All the same , he was n't either registered or expected , so there was a little fuss . Finally they tried to ware him by saying he came at his own risk and that t here were some pretty tough characters about . But Doc Mellhorn remarked that he 'd practiced in Steeltown . So , after he 'd told them what seemed to him a million times that he was a physician on a case , they finally let him in and directed him to Paisley Grew . Paisley was on Level 346 in Pit 68,953 , and Doc Mellhorn recognized him the minute he saw him . He even had the jew's-harp , stuck in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Paisley finally , when the first greetings were over , " you certainly are a sight for sore eyes ! Though , of course , I 'm sorry to see you here , " and he grinned . " Well , I ca n't see that it 's so different from a lot of places , " said Doc Mellhorn , wiping his forehead . " Warmish , though . " " It 's the humidity , really , " said Paisley Grew . " ' I hat 's what it really is . " " Yes , I know , " said Doc Mellhorn . " And now tell nte , Paisley ; how 's that indigestion of yours ? "  | " Well , I 'll tell you , Doc , " said Paisley . " When I first came here , I thought the climate was doing it good . I did for a fact . But now I 'm not so sure . I 've tried all sorts of things for it  --  I 've even tried being transferred to the boiling asphalt lakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then , when I least expect it , it catches me . Take last night . I did n't have a thing to eat that I do n't generally eat  --  well , maybe I did have one little snort of hot sulphur , but it was n't the sulphur that did it . All the same , I woke up at four , and it was just like a knife . Now ... ' ' He went on from there and it took him some time . And Doc Mellhorn listened , happy as a clam . He never thought he 'd be glad to listen to a hypochondriac , but he was . And when Paisley was all through , he examined him and prescribed for him . It was just a little soda bicarb and pepsin , but Paisley said it took hold somethingwonderful . And they had a fine time that evening , talking over the old days . Finally , of course , the talk got around to how Paisley liked it where he was . And Paisley was honest enough about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course this is n't the place for you , and I can see you 're just visiting . But I have n't many real complaints . It 's hot , to be sure , and they work you , and some of the boys here are rough . But they 've had some pretty interesting experiences , too , when you get them talking  --  yes , sir . And anyhow , it is n't Peabodyville , New Jersey , " he said with vehemence . " I spent five years in Peabodyville , trying to work up in the leather business . After that I bust out ,  |p133and  I guess that 's what landed me here . But it 's an improvementon Peabodyville . " He looked at Doc Mellhornsidewise . " Say , Doc , " he said , " I know this is a vacation for you , but all the same there 's a couple of the boys  --  nothing really wrong with them of course  --  but  --  well , if you could just look them over  --  " " I was thinking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc Mellhorn . So Paisley took him around and they found a nice little place for an office in one of the abandoned mine galleries , and Doc Mellhorn hung out his shingle . And right away patients started coming around . They did n't get many doctors there , in the first place , and the ones they did get were n't exactly the cream of the profession , so Doc Mellhorn had it all to himself . It was mostly sprains , fractures , bruises and dislocations , of course , with occasional burns and scalds  --  and , on the whole , i t reminded Doc Mellhorn a good deal of his practice in Steeltown , especially when it came to foreign bodies in t he eye . Now and then Doc Mellhorn ran into a more unusual case  --  for instance , there was one of the guards t hat got part of himself pretty badly damaged in a rock slide . Well , Doc Mellhorn had never set a tail before , but he managed it all right , and got a beautiful primary union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no X-ray facilities . He thought of writing up the case for the State Medical Journal , but then he could n't figure out any way to send it to them , so he had to let it slide . And then there was an advanced carcinoma of the liver  --  a Greek named Papadoupolous or Prometheus or something . Doc Mellhorn could n't do much for him ,  |p134considering  the circumstances , but he did what he could , and he and the Greek used to have long conversations . The rest was just everyday practice  --  run of the mine  --  but he enjoyed it . Now and then it would cross his mind that he ought to get out Lizzie and run back to the other place for a visit with the folks . But that was just like going back East had been on earth  --  he 'd think he had everything pretty well cleared up , and then a new flock of patients would come in . And it was n't that he did n't miss his wife and children and grandchildren  --  he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and he knew it . And there was the work in front of him and the office crowded every day . So he just went along , hardly noticingthe time . Now and then , to be sure , he 'd get a suspicion that he was n't too popular with the authorities of the place . But he was used to not being popular with authorities and he did n't pay much attention . But finally they sent an inspector around . The minute Doc Mellhorn saw him , he knew there was going to be trouble . Not that the inspector was uncivil . In fact , he was a pretty high-up official  --  you could tell by his antlers . And Doc Mellhorn was just as polite , showing him around . He showed him the free dispensary and the clinic and the nurse  --  Scotch girl named Smith , she was  --  and the dental chair he 'd rigged up with the help of a fellow named Ferguson , who used to be an engineerbefore he was sentenced . And the inspector looked them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . The girl named Smith had put upp135curtains in the office , and with that and a couple of potted gas plants it looked more homelike than it had . F he inspector looked around it and sighed . " I 'm sorry , Doctor Mellhorn , " he said at last , " but you can see for yourself , it wo n't do . " " What wo n't do ? " said Doc Mellhorn , stoutly . But , a l l the same , he felt afraid . " Any of it , " said the inspector . " We could overlook the alleviation of minor suffering  --  I 'd be inclined to do so myself  --  though these people are here to stiffer , and there 's no changing that . But you 're playing merry ! lades with the whole system . " " I 'm a physician in practice , " said Doc Mellhorn . " Yes , " said the inspector . " That 's just the trouble . Now , take these reports you 've been sending , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you to say about that ? " " Well , seeing as there 's no county health officer , or at least I could n't find one  --  " said Doc Mellhorn . " Precisely , " said the inspector . " And what have you done ? You 've condemned fourteen levels of this pit as unsanitary nuisances . You 've recommended 2136 lost souls for special diet , remedial exercise , hospitalization  --  Well  --  I wo n't go through the list . " " I 'll stand back of every one of those recommendations , " said Doc Mellhorn . " And now we 've got the chair working , we can handle most of the dental work on t he spot . Only Ferguson needs more amalgam . " " I know , " said the inspector patiently , " but the money has to come from somewhere  --  you must realize that . We 're not a rich community , in spite of what people think . And these unauthorized requests  --  oh , we fill them , of course , but  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And that last batch was n't standard . I would n't use it on a dog . " " He 's always needing more amalgam ! " said the inspectorbitterly , making a note . " Is he going to fill every tooth in Hades ? By the way , my wife tells me I need a little work done myself  --  but we wo n't go into that . We 'll take just one thing  --  your entirely unauthorized employment o Miss Smith . Miss Smith has no business working for you . She 's supposed to be gnawed by a never-dying worm every Monday , Wednesday and Friday . " " Sounds silly to me , " said Doc Mellhorn . " I do n't care how silly it sounds , " said the inspector . " It 's regulations . And , besides , she is n't even a registerednurse . " " She 's a practical one , " said Doc Mellhorn . " Of course , back on earth a lot of her patients died . But that was because when she did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't poison anybody here and I 've kind of got her out of the notion of it anyway . She 's been doing A-i work for me and I 'd like to recommend her for  --  " " Please ! " said the inspector . " Please ! And as if that was n't enough , you 've even been meddling with the staff . I 've a note here on young Asmodeus  --  Asmodeus XIV  --  " " Oh , you mean Mickey ! " said Doc Mellhorn , with ap137chuckle . " Short for Mickey Mouse . We call him that in the clinic . And he 's a young imp if I ever saw one . " " The original Asmodeus is one of our most prominentcitizens , " said the inspector severely . " How do you suppose he felt when we got your report that his fourteenth great-grandson had rickets ? " " Well , " said Doc Mellhorn , " I know rickets . And he had ' em . And you 're going to have rickets in these youngsters as long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the best Pennsylvania anthracite , and look at him now ! " " I admit the success of your treatment , " said the inspector , " but , naturally  --  well , since then we 've been deluged with demands for anthracite from as far south as Sheol . We 'll have to float a new bond issue . And what will the taxpayers say ? " " He was just cutting his first horns when he came to us , " said Doc Mellhorn reminiscently , " and they were coming in crooked . Now , I ask you , did you ever we a straighter pair ? Of course , if I 'd had cod liver oil  --  My gracious , you ought to have somebody here that c an fill a prescription ; I ca n't do it all . " The inspector shut his papers together with a snap . " I 'm sorry , Doctor Mellhorn , " he said , " but this is final . You have no right here , in the first place ; no to al license to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little irregular , " said Doc Mellhorn , " hut I 'm a registered member of four different medical associations  --  you might take that into account . And I 'll take any examination that 's required . " " No , " said the inspector violently . " No , no , no !  |p138You  ca n't stay here ! You 've got to go away ! It is n't possible ! " Doc Mellhorn drew a long breath . " Well , " he said , " there was n't any work for me at the other place . And here you wo n't let me practice . So what 's a man to do ? " The inspector was silent " Tell me , " said Doc Mellhorn presently . " Suppose you do throw me out ? What happens to Miss Smith and Paisley and the rest of them ? " " Oh , what 's done is done , " said the inspector impatiently , " here as well as anywhere else . We 'll have to keep on with the anthracite and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . If it 's any satisfaction to you , you 've started something . " " Well , I guess Smith and Ferguson between them can handle the practice , " said Doc Mellhorn . " But , that 's got to be a promise . " " It 's a promise , " said the inspector . " Then there 's Mickey  --  I mean Asmodeus , " said Doc Mellhorn . " He 's a smart youngster  --  smart as a whip  --  if he is a hellion . Well , you know how a youngstergets . Well , it seems he wants to be a doctor . But I do n't know what sort of training he 'd get  --  " " He 'll get it , " said the inspector feverishly . " We 'll found the finest medical college you ever saw , right here in West Baal . We 'll build a hospital that 'll knock your eye out . You 'll be satisfied . But now , if you do n't mind  --  " " All right , " said Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But do n't you want to  --  " he said . " I mean my inseructions are we'rep139to give you a banquet , if necessary  --  after all , the communityappreciates  --  " Thanks , " said Doc Mellhorn , with a shudder , " but if I 've got to go , I 'd rather get out of town . You hang around and announce your retirement , and pretty soon folks start thinking they ought to give you a testimonial . And I never did like testimonials . " All the same , before he left he took a silver half dollar out of Mickey Asmodeus ' chin . When he was back on the road again and the lights of the gates had faded into a low ruddy glow behind him , Doc Mellhorn felt alone for the first time . He 'd been lonely at times during his life , but he 'd never felt alone like this before . Because , as far as he could sec , there was only him and Lizzie now . " Now , maybe if I 'd talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always was pigheaded . " He did n't pay much attention to the way he was driving and it seemed to him that the road was n't quite the same . But he felt tired for a wonder  --  hone-tired and beaten  --  and he did n't much care about the road . He had n't felt tired since he left earth , but now the loneliness tired him . " Active  --  always been active , " he said to himself . " I ca n't just lay down on the job . But what 's a man to do ? " " What 's a man to do ? " he said . " I 'm a doctor . I ca n't work miracles . " Then the black fit came over him and he remembered all the times he 'd been wrong and all the people he could n't do anything for .

There were white markers on it now and I Arlie seemed to be bouncing down a residential street . l here were trees in the street and it reminded him of town . He rubbed his eyes for a second and Lizzie rolled on by herself  --  she often did . It did n't seem strange to him to stop at the right house . " Well , Mother , " he said rather gruffly to the group on the lawn . " Well , Dad . . . . Well , Uncle Frank . " He beheld a small , stern figure advancing , hands outstretched . " Well , Grandma , " he said meekly . Later on he was walking up and down in the grape arbor with Uncle Frank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd always been good grapes , those Catawbas , as he remembered them . " What beats me , " he said , not for the first time , " is why I did n't notice the Gates . The second time , I mean .

" That Gate , my dear Edward  --  well , of course it has to be there in the first place . Literature , you know . And then , it 's a choice , " he said richly . " I 'll draw cards , " said Doc Mellhorn . He ate anothergrape . " Fact is , " said Uncle Frank , " that Gate 's for one kind of person . You pass it and then you can rest for all eternity . Just fold your hands . It suits some . " " I can see that it would , " said Doc Mellhorn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't suit a Mellhorn . I 'm happy to say that very few of our family remain permanently on that side . I spent some time there myself . " He said , rather self-consciously , " Well , my last years had been somewhat stormy . So few peoplep143cared for refined impersonations of our feathered songsters , including lightning sketches . I felt that I 'd earned a rest . But after a while  --  well , I got tired of being at liberty . " " And what happens when you get tired ? " said Doc Mellhorn . " You find out what you want to do , " said Uncle Frank . " My kind of work ? " said Doc Mellhorn . " Your kind of work , " said his uncle . " Been busy , have n't you ? " " Well , " said Doc Mellhorn . " But here . If there is n't so much as a case of mumps in  --  " " Would it have to be mumps ? " said his uncle . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be a ranged . But how many new souls do you suppose we get here a day ? " " Sizable lot , I expect . " " And how many of them get here in first-class condition ? " said Uncle Frank triumphantly . " Why , I 've seen Doctor Rush  --  Benjamin Rush  --  come back so lined from a day 's round he could hardly flap one pinion against the other . Oh , if it 's work you want  --  And then , of course , there 's the earth . " " Hold on , " said Doc Mellhorn . " I 'm not going to appear to any young intern in wings and a harp . Not at my time of life . And anyway , he 'd laugh himself sick . " " ' Tai n't that , " said Uncle Frank . " Look here . You 've left children and grandchildren behind you , have n't you ? And they 're going on ? " " Yes , " said Doc Mellhorn.  | " Same with what you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside part of it  --  that stays .

" " Pshaw , any man 's done that , " said Doc Mellhorn . " But you take the adrenal  --  " " Take anything you like , " said Uncle Frank placidly . " I 'm not going to argue with you . Not my department . But you 'll find it is n't all adrenalin . Like it here ? " he said abruptly . " Feel satisfied ? " " Why , yes , " said Doc Mellhorn surprisedly , " I do . " He looked around the grape arbor and suddenly realized that he felt happy . " No , they would n't all arrive in first-class shape , " he said to himself . " So there 'd be a place . " He turned to Uncle Frank . " By the way , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick  --  there would n't be a chance of my visiting the other establishment now and then ? Where I just came from ? Smith and Ferguson are all right , but I 'd like to keep in touch . " " Well , " said Uncle Frank , " you can take that up with the delegation . " He arranged the handkerchief in his breast pocket . " They ought to be along any minute now , " he said . " Sister 's been in a stew about it all day . She says there wo n't be enough chairs , but she always says that . " " Delegation ? " said Doc Mellhorn . " But  --  " " You do n't realize , " said Uncle Frank , with his rich chuckle . " You 're a famous man . You 've broken pretty near every regulation except the fire laws , and refusedp145the Gate first crack . They 've got to do something about it . " But  --  " said Doc Mellhorn , looking wildly around for a place of escape . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head and look as though money were bid for you . It wo n't take long  --  just a welcome . " He shaded his eyes with his hand . " My , " he said with frank admiration , " you 've c c mainly brought them out . There 's Rush , by the way . " " Where ? " said Doc Mellhorn . " Second from the left , third row , in a wig , " said Uncle Frank . " And there 's  --  " Then he stopped , and stepped aside . A tall grave figure was advancing down the grape arbor  --  a bearded man with a wise , majestic face who wore robes as if they belonged to him , not as Doc Mellhorn had seen them worn in college commencements . There was a small fillet of gold about his head and in his left hand , Doc Mellhorn noticed without astonishment , was a winged staff entwined with two fangless serpents . Behindhim were many others . Doc Mellhorn stood straighter . The bearded figure stopped in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aesculapius . " It 's an honor to meet you , Doctor , " said Doc Mellhorn . He shook the outstretched hand . Then he took is silver half dollar from the mouth of the left-hand snake.  | THE younger child sat bolt upright , her bedclothes wrapped around her . " If you 're going down to look at them , " she whisperedaccusingly , " I 'm coming , too ! And Alice ' ! ! catch you . " " She wo n't catch me . " Her elder sister 's voice was scornful . " She 's out in the pantry , helping . With the man from Gray 's . " " All the same , I 'm coming . I want to see if it 's ice cream in little molds or just the smashed kind with strawberries . And , if Alice wo n't catch you , she wo n't catch me . " " It 'll be molds , " said the other , from the depths of experience , " Mother always has molds for the Whitehouses . And Mr. Whitehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sweet . You 'd think he 'd know that 's dopey but he does n't . And , anyhow , it is n't your turn .

And then they hear us and somebody comes up  --  " " Sometimes they bring you things , when they come  | up , " said the younger dreamily . " The man with the pink face did . And he said I was a little angel . " " Was he dopey ! " said her elder , blightingly , " and anyhow , you were sick afterwards and you know what Mother said about it . " The younger child sighed , a long sigh of defeat and resignation . " All right , " she said . " But next time it is my turn . And you tell me if it 's in molds . " Her elder nodded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of the stairs , a small landing offered an excellent observation post , provided one could get there unperceived . Jennifer Sharp reached it soundlesslyand , curling herself up into the smallest possible space , stared eagerly down and across into the dining room . She could n't see the whole table . But she saw at once that Mrs. Whitehouse had a thing like a silver beetle in her hair , that Colonel Crandall looked more like a police dog than ever , and that there were little silver baskets of pink and white mints . That meant that it was really a grand dinner . She made a special note of the ice cream for Joan . Talk and laughter drifted up to her  --  strange phrases and incomprehensible jests from another world , to be remembered , puzzled over , and analyzed for meaningor the lack of it , when she and Joan were alone . She hugged her knees , she was having a good time . Pretty soon , Father would light the little blue flame under the mysterious glass machine that made the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him now , appraisingly . Colonel Crandallhad fought Germans in trenches and Mr. Whitehousehad a bank to keep his money in . But Father , on the whole , was nicer than either of them . She remembered , as if looking back across a vast plain , when Father and Mother had merely been Father and Mother  --  huge , natural phenomena , beloved but inexplicableas the weather  --  unique of their kind . Now she was older  --  she knew that other people 's fathers and mothers were different . Even Joan knew that , though Joan was still a great deal of a baby . Jennifer felt very old and rather benevolent as she considered herself and her parents and the babyishness of Joan . Mr. Whitehouse was talking , but Father wanted to talk , too  --  she knew that from the quick little gesturehe made with his left hand . Now they all laughed and Father leaned forward . " That reminds me , " he was saying , " of one of our favorite stories  --  " How young and amused his face looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow , a tarred but tolerant smile on her lips . She knew what was coming . When Terry Farrell and Roger Sharp fell in love , the war to end war was just over , bobbed hair was still an issue , the movies did not talk and women 's clothes could n't be crazier . It was also generally admitted that the younger generation was wild but probably sound at heart and that , as soon as we got a businessman in the White House , things were going to be all right.  | 52 As for Terry and Roger , they were both wild and sophisticated . They would have told you so . Terry had been kissed by several men at several dances and Roger could remember the curious , grimy incident of the girl at Fort Worth . So that showed you . They were entirely emancipated and free . But they fell in love very simply and unexpectedly  --  and their marriage was going to be like no other marriage , because they knew all the right answers to all the questions , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first , in fact , they were going to form a free union  --  they had read of that , in popular books of the period . But , somehowor other , as soon as Roger started to call , both families began to get interested . They had no idea ' of paying the slightest attention to their families . But , when your family happens to comment favorably on the man or girl that you are in love with , that is a hard thing to fight . Before they knew it , they were formally engaged , and liking it on the whole , though both of them agreed that a formal engagement was an outworn and ridiculous social custom . They quarreled often enough , for they were young , and a trifle ferocious in the vehemence with which they expressed the views they knew to be right . These views had to do , in general , with freedom and personality , and were often supported by quotations from The Golden Bough . Neither of them had read The Golden Bough all the way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the quarrels were about generalities and had no sting . And always , before and after , was the sense of discovering in each other previously unsus/pected but delightful potentialities and likenesses and beliefs . As a matter of fact , they were quite a well-suited couple  --  " made for each other , " as the saying used to go ; though they would have hooted at the idea . They had read the minor works of Havelock Ellis and knew the name of Freud . They did n't believe in people being " made for each other "  --  they were too advanced . It was ten days before the date set for their marriage that their first real quarrel occurred . And then , unfortunately , it did n't stop at generalities . They had got away for the day from the presents and their families , to take a long walk in the country , with a picnic lunch . Both , in spite of themselves , were a little solemn , a little nervous . The atmosphere of Approaching Wedding weighed on them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , when they looked at each other , they felt strange . Terry had been shopping the day before  --  she was tired , she began to wish that Roger would not walk so fast . Roger was wondering if the sixth usher  --  the one who had been in the marines  --  would really turn up . His mind also held dark suspicions as to the probable behavior of the best man , when it came to such outworn customs as rice and shoes . They were sure that they were in love , sure now , that they wanted to be married . But their conversation was curiously polite . The lunch did something for them , so did the peace of being alone . But they had forgotten the salt and ' Ferry had rubbed her heel . When Roger got out his pipe , there was only tobacco left for half a smoke . Still ,  |p154the  wind was cool and the earth pleasant and , as they sat with their backs against a gray boulder in the middle of a green field , they began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran stronger  --  in a moment or two , they would be the selves they had always known . It was , perhaps , unfortunate that Roger should have selected that particular moment in which to tell the anteater story . He knocked out his pipe and smiled , suddenly , at something in his mind . Terry felt a knock at her heart , a sudden sweetness on her tongue  --  how young and amused he always looked when he smiled ! She smiled back at him , her whole face changing . " What is it , darling ? " she said . He laughed . " Oh nothing , " he said . " I just happened to remember . Did you ever hear the story about the anteater ? " She shook her head . " Well , " he began . " Oh , you must have heard it  --  sure you have n't ? Well , anyway , there was a little town down South .. . " And the coon said , Why , lady , that ai n't no anteater  --  that 's Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments later . He could n't help laughing when he had finished  --  the silly tale always amused him , old as it was . Then he looked at Terry and saw that she was not laughing . " Why , what 's the matter ? " he said , mechanically . " Are you cold , dear , or  --  "  |p155Her  hand , which had been slowly stiffening in his clasp , now withdrew itself entirely from his . " No " she said , staring ahead of her , " I 'm all right . Thanks . " He looked at her . There was somebody there he had never seen before . " Well , " he said , confusedly , " well . " Then his mouth set , his jaw stuck out , he also regarded the landscape . Terry stole a glance at him . It was terrible and appallingto see him sitting there , looking bleak and estranged . She wanted to speak , to throw herself at him , to say : " Oh , it 's all my fault  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saying it . ' Then she remembered the anteater and her heart hardened . It was not even , she told herself sternly , as if it were a dirty story . It was n't  --  and , if it had been , were n't they always going to be frank and emancipated with each other about things like that ? But it was just the kind of story she 'd always hated  --  cruel and  --  yes  --  vulgar . Not even healthily vulgar  --  vulgar with no redeeming adjective . He ought to have known she hated that kind of story . He ought to have known ! If love meant anything , according to the books , it meant understanding the other person , did n't it ? And , if you did n't understand them , in such a little thing , why , what was life going to be afterwards ? Love was like a new silver dollar  --  bright , untarnished and whole . There could be no possible compromises with love. pI56 All these confused but vehement thoughts flashed through her mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumpy and that the rub on her heel was a little red spot of pain . And then Roger was speaking . " I 'm sorry you found my story so unamusing , " he said in stiff tones of injury and accusation . " If I 'd known about the way you felt , I 'd have tried to tell a funnier one  --  even if we did say  --  " He stopped , his frozen face turned toward her . She could feel the muscles of her own face tighten and freeze in answer . " I was n't in the least shocked , I assure you , " she said in the same , stilted voice . " I just did n't think ' it was very funny . That 's all . " " I get you . Well , pardon my glove , " he said , and turned to the landscape . A little pulse of anger began to beat in her wrist . Something was being hurt , something was being broken . If he 'd only been Roger and kissed her instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I did n't think it was funny at all , " she said , in a voice whose sharpness surprised her , " if you want to know . Just sort of cruel and common and  --  well , the poor Negro  --  " " That 's right ! " he said , in a voice of bitter irritation , " pity the coon ! Pity everybody but the person who 's trying to amuse you ! I think it 's a damn funny story  --  always have  --  and  --  " They were both on their feet and stabbing at each other , now.  | " And it 's vulgar , " she was saying , hotly , " plain vulgar  --  not even dirty enough to be funny . Anteater indeed ! Why , Roger Sharp , it 's  --  " " Where 's that sense of humor you were always talking about ? " he was shouting . " My God , what 's happened to you , Terry ? I always thought you were  --  and here you  --  " Well , we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , " she could hear her strange voice , saying . Then , even more dreadfully , came his unfamiliar accents , " Well , if that 's the way you feel about it , we certainly have . " They looked at each other , aghast . " Here ! " she was saying , " here ! Oh , Lord , why wo n't it come off my finger ? " " You keep that on  --  do you hear , you damn little fool ? " he roared at her , so unexpectedly that she started , tripped , caught her shoe in a cleft of rock , fell awkwardly , and , in spite of all her resolves , burst undignifiedlyand conventionally into a passion of tears . Then there was the reconciliation . It took place , no doubt , on entirely conventional lines , and was studded with " No , it was my fault ! Say it was ! " but , to them it was an event unique in history . Terry thought it over remorsefully , that evening , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fool . She knew the inexplicable solace of feeling that she had been a little fool . And yet , they had said those things to each other , and meant them . He had hurt her , she had actually meant to hurt him . She stared at these facts , solemnly.  | Love , the bright silver dollar . Not like the commonplace coins in other people 's pockets . But something special , different  --  already a little , ever-so-faintly tarnished , as a pane is tarnished by breath ? She had been a little fool . But she could n't quite forget the anteater . Then she was in Roger 's arms  --  and knew , with utter confidence , that she and Roger were different . They were always going to be different . Their marriage would n't ever be like any other marriage in the world . The Sharps had been married for exactly six years and five hours and Terry , looking across the table at the clever , intelligent face of her affectionate and satisfactoryhusband , suddenly found herself most desolately alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  going to the Lattimores for dinner on their own anniversary . Mr. Lattimore was the head of Roger 's company  --  Mrs. Lattimore 's invitation had almost the force of a royal command . They had talked it over , Roger and she , and decided , sensibly , that they could n't get out of it . But , all the same , it had been a mistake . They were rational , modern human beings , she assuredherself ferociously . They were n't like the horrible married couples in the cartoons  --  the little woman asking her baffled mate if he remembered what date it was , and the rest of it . They thought better of life and love than to tie either of them to an artificial scheme of days . They were different . Nevertheless , there had been a time when they had said to each other , with foolishp159smiles , " We 've been married a week  --  or a month  --  or a year ! Just think of it ! " This time now seemed to her , as she looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered Roger with odd dispassionateness . Yes , there he was  --  an intelligent , rising young man in his first thirties . Not particularly handsome but indubitablyattractive  --  charming , when he chose  --  a loyal friend , a good father , a husband one could take pt isle in . And it seemed to her that if he made that nervous little gesture with his left hand again  --  or told the anteater story  --  she would scream . It was funny that the knowledge that you had lost everything that you had most counted upon should come to you at a formal dinner party , while you talked over the war days with a dark-haired officer whose voice had the honey of the South in it . Then she remembered that she and Roger had first discovered their love for each other , not upon a moon-swept lawn , but in the fly specked waiting room of a minor railroad station  --  and the present event began to seem less funny . Life was like that . It gave , unexpectedly , abruptly , with no regard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as unexpectedly and abruptly , it took away . While her mouth went on talking , a part . of ' her mind searched numbly and painfully for the reasons whit It had brought this calamity about . They had loved rat h other in the beginning  --  even now , she was sure of that . They had tried to be wise , they had not broken faith , they had been frank and gay . No deep division of nature sundered them  --  no innate fault in either , spreading under pressure , to break the walls of theirp160house apart . She looked for a guilty party but she could find none . There was only a progression of days ; a succession of tiny events that followed in each others ' footsteps without haste or rest . That was all , but that seemed to have been enough . And Roger was looking over at her  --  with that same odd , exploring glance she had used a moment ago . What remained ? A house with a little boy asleep in it , a custom of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Enough for most people , perhaps ? They had wanted more than that . Something said to her , " Well and if  --  after all  --  the real thing has n't even come ? " She turned to her dinner partner , for the first time really seeing him . When you did see him , he was quite a charming person . His voice was delightful . There was nothing in him in the least like Roger Sharp . She laughed and saw , at the laugh , something wake in his eyes . He , too , had not been really conscious of her , before . But he was , now . She was not thirty , yet  --  she had kept her looks . She felt old powers , old states of mind flow back to her ; things she had thought forgotten , the glamor of first youth . Somewhere , on the curve of a dark lake , a boat was drifting  --  a man was talking to her  --  she could not see his face but she knew it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mrs. Lattimore 's voice . " Why , I 'd never have dreamt ! " Mrs. Lattimore was saying " I had no idea ! " She called down the table ,  | " George ! Do you know it 's these people 's anniversary  --  so sweet of them to come  --  and I positively had to worm it out of Mr. Sharp ! " Terry went hot and cold all over . She was sensible , she was brokenhearted , love was a myth , but she had particularly depended on Roger not to tell anybody that this was their anniversary . And Roger had told . She lived through the congratulations and the customaryjokes about " Well , this is your seventh year beginning  --  and you know what they say about the seventh year ! " She even lived through Mrs. Lattimore 's pensive " Six years ! Why , my dear , I never would have believed it ! You 're children  --  positive children ! " She could have bitten Mrs. Lattimore . " Children ! " she thought , indignantly , " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She tried to freeze Roger , at long distance , but he was not looking her way . And then she aught her breath , for a worse fate was in store for her . Someone , most unhappily , had brought up the subject of pet animals . She saw a light break slowly on Roger 's face  --  she saw him lean forward . She prayed fur the roof to fall , for time to stop , for Mrs. Lattimore to explode like a Roman candle into green and purple stirs . But , even as she prayed , she knew that it was no use . Roger was going to tell the anteater story . The story no longer seemed shocking to her , or even e i ' tel . But it epitomized all the years of her life with Roger . In the course of those years , she calculated desperately , she had heard that story at least a hundred tittles . Somehow  --  she never knew how  --  she managed top162survive the hundred-and-first recital , from the hideously familiar , " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jubilant " That 's Edward ! " at the end . She even summoned up a fixed smile to meet the tempest of laughter that followed . And then , mercifully , Mrs. Lattimorewas giving the signal to rise . The men hung behind  --  the anteater story had been capped by another . Terry found herself , unexpectedly , tete-a-tete with Mrs. Lattimore . " My dear , " the great lady was saying , " I 'd rather have asked you another night , of course , if I 'd known . But I am very glad you could come tonight . George particularly wished Mr. Golden to meet your brilliant husband . They are going into that Western project together , you know , and Tom Golden leaves tomorrow . So we both appreciate your kindness in coming . " Terry found a sudden queer pulse of warmth through the cold fog that seemed to envelop her . " Oh , " she stammered , " but Roger and I have been married for years  --  and we were delighted to come  --  " She looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , with an irrepressible burst of confidence , " does n't it ever seem to you as if you could n't bear to hear a certainstory again  --  not if you died ? " A gleam of mirth appeared in Mrs. Lattimore 's eyes . " My dear , " she said " has George ever told you about his trip to Peru ? " " No . " " Well , do n't let him . " She reflected , " or , no  --  do let him , " she said . " Poor George  --  he does get such funp163o u t of it . And you would be a new audience . But it happenedfifteen years ago , my dear , and I think I could repeat every word after him verbatim , once he 's started . so  --  I often feel as if he 'd never stop . " " And then what do you do ? " said Terry , breathlessly  --  far too interested now to remember tact . The older woman smiled . " I think of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uffizi gallery , " she said . " George must have heard that story ten thousand times . But he 's still alive . " She put her hand on the younger woman 's arum . " We 're all of us alike , my dear , " she said . " When I 'm an old lady in a wheel chair , George will st i l l he telling me about Peru . But then , if he did n't , I would n't know he was George . " She turned away , leaving Terry to ponder over the words . Her anger was not appeased  --  her life s t i l l l a y about her in ruins . But , when the dark young officer came into the room , she noticed that his face seemed lather commonplace and his voice was merely a pleasant voice . Mr. Golden 's car dropped the Sharps at their house . The two men stayed at the gate for a moment , talking'ferry ran in to see after the boy . He was sleeping peacefully with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . Suddenly , all around her were the familiar sights and sounds of home . She felt tired and as if she had come back from a long journey . She went downstairs . Roger was just coming in . He looked tired , too , she noticed , but exultant as well . " Golden had to run , " he said at once . " Left good-byp164for you  --  hoped you would n't mind  --  said awfully nice things . He 's really a great old boy , Terry . And , as for this new Western business  --  " He noticed the grave look on her face and his own grew grave . " I am sorry , darling , " he said . " Did you mind it a lot ? Well , I did  --  but it could n't be helped . You bet your life that next time  --  " " Oh , next time  --  " she said , and kissed him . " Of course I did n't mind . We 're different , are n't we ? " That intelligent matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own dinner table , from time to time made the appropriate interjections  --  the " Really ? " s and " Yes indeed " s and " That 's what I always tell Roger " s  --  which comprised the whole duty of a hostess in Colonel Crandall 's case . Colonel Crandall was singularly restful  --  give him these few crumbs and he could be depended upon to talk indefinitely and yet without creating a conversational desert around him . Mrs. Sharp was very grateful to him at the moment . She wanted to retire to a secret place in her mind and observe her own dinner party , for an instant , as a spectator  --  and Colonel Crandall was giving her the chance . It was going very well indeed . She had hoped for it from the first , but now she was sure of it and she gave a tiny , inaudible sigh of relief . Roger was at his best  --  the young Durwards had recovered from their initial shyness  --  Mr. Whitehouse had not yet started talking politics  --  the souffle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind drift off upon other things . P165Tomorrow , Roger must remember about the light gray suit , she must make a dental appointment for Jennifer , Mrs. Quaritch must be dealt with tactfully in the matter of the committee . It was too early to decide about camp for the girls but Roger Junior must know they were proud of his marks , and if Mother intended to give up her trip just because of poor old Miss Tompkins  --  well , something would have to be done . There were also the questions of the new oil furnace , the School board and the Brewster wedding . But none of these really bothered her  --  her life was always busy  --  and , at the moment , she felt an unwonted desire to look back into Time . Over twenty years since the Armistice . Twenty years . And Roger Junior was seventeen  --  and she and Roger had been married since nineteen-twenty . Pretty soon they would be celebrating their twentieth anniversary . It seemed incredible but it was true . She looked back through those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature that laughed or wept for forgotten reasons , ran wildly here , sat solemn as a young judge there . She felt a pang of sympathy for that young heedlessness , a pang of humor as well . She was not old but she had been so very young . Roger and she  --  the beginning  --  the first years  --  Roger Junior 's birth . The house on Edgehill Road , the one with the plate rail in the dining room , and crying when they left because they 'd never be so happy again , but they had , and it was an inconvenient house . Being jealous of Milly Baldwin  --  and how foolish !  --  and the awful country-club dance where Roger got drunk ; and1 66 TALES BEFORE MIDNIGI l " l ' P166it was n't awful any more . The queer , piled years of the boom  --  the crash  --  the bad time  --  Roger coming home after Tom Golden 's suicide and the look on his face . Jennifer . Joan . Houses . People . Events . And always the headlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinning , dinning " No security  --  trouble  --  disaster  --  no security . " And yet , out of insecurity , they had loved and made children . Out of insecurity , for the space of breath , for an hour , they had built , and now and then found peace . No , there 's no guarantee , she thought . There 's no guarantee . When you 're young , you think there is , But there is n't . And yet I 'd do it over . Pretty soon we 'll have been married twenty years . " Yes , that 's what I always tell Roger , " she said , automatically . Colonel Crandall smiled and proceeded . He was still quite handsome , she thought , in his dark way , but he was getting very bald . Roger 's hair had a few gray threads in it but it was still thick and unruly . She liked men to keep their hair . She remembered , a long while ago , thinking something or other about Colonel Crandall 's voice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed a small white speck on the curve of the stairway but said nothing . The wrapper was warm and , if Jennifer was n't noticed , she would creep back to bed soon enough . It was different with Joan . Suddenly , she was alert . Mrs. Durward , at Roger 's end of the table , had mentioned the Zoo . She knew what that meant  --  Zoo  --  the new buildings  --  the new Housing Commissioner  --  and Mr. Whitehouse let loosep167on his favorite political grievance all through the end of dinner . She caught Roger 's eye for a miraculous instant . Mr. Whitehouse was already clearing his throat . But Roger had the signal . Roger would save them . She saw his left hand tapping in its little gesture  --  felt him suddenly draw the party together . How young and amused his face looked , under the candlelight ! " That reminds me of one of our favorite stories , " he was saying . She sank back in her chair . A deep contentpervaded her . He was going to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people had heard it , they would have to laugh , he always told it so well . She smiled in anticipation of the triumphant " That 's Edward ! " And , after that , if Mr. Whitehouse still threatened , she herself would tell the story about Joan and the watering pot . Jennifer crept back into the darkened room . " Well ? " said an eager whisper from the other bed . Jennifer drew a long breath . The memory of the lighted dinner table rose before her , varicolored , glittering , portentous  --  a stately omen  --  a thing of splendor and mystery , to be pondered upon for days . How could she ever make Joan see it as she had seen it ? And Joan was such a baby , anyway . " Oh  --  nobody saw me , " she said , in a bored voice , " But it was in molds , that 's all  --  oh yes  --  and rather told the anteater story again . " P168DO N'T know why everybody keeps on going toAngelo 's . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a little worse , if anything  --  and the dinner never was much . I 'm getting so I can hardly look a sardine in the eye any more . Of course it 's a quiet place , and they do n't let in many college boys . It 's generally just the old crowd from five o'clock on . Oh , people come and go naturally  --  the way they do in New York . If they did n't , I do n't suppose Angelo could keep on running . But what I mean is , you can drop in almost any time after curfew and find somebody you know to have a quick one or a couple of quick ones with . And then , if that 's your weakness , you can stay and get dinner ; though I wish they 'd try another brand of sardines . Suppose everyone stopped coming , all at once ? Or suppose the place closed ? I do n't like to think about that . I suppose it 's bound to happen , sooner or later , when Angelo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there 'll be all the trouble and bother of finding another place ; and the crowd wo n't be the same . You ca n't keep a crowd together , once you move the place , in New York . It seems pretty safe , though , at the moment , I 'm glad to say . There 's never been any real trouble , you see ; no one ever gets shot at Angelo 's , andp169when the visiting firemen get too noisy , Rocco just eases them out . Rocco 's the little one with the grin , and he does n't look strong , but how he can ease a fellow out when it 's necessary ! He did it to me only once , and I 've never held it against him . That was just after Evie and I had broken up . No , I do n't think there 's any need to worry for a while yet . And when there is , I 'm sure Angelo will tell me about it far enough ahead so I can make my arrangements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't go back to the Twelfth Street place , the way Mr. Forman does , but seven years is a long time in this man 's town . They 're easing Mr. Forman out a t11:30 these days . It used to be all hours when I first knew him , but a man ca n't expect to drink like that at his age and not show it in the whites of the eyes . That 's another thing I have against all this changing around . You get started going from one place to anotherand buying taxis and going in for general snake dancing ; and before you know where you are you 're on a party , and the whole next day is bad . Well , now , if you work at all , you ca n't afford to have the week days go bad on you . I 'm not talking of Saturday night  --  there 's a law about that . And of course those impromptuharvest homes are a lot of fun when you 're young and new to the town . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a fool if you do n't run on schedule . Is n't that so ? Now , at Angelo 's , you always know where you are . A couple of quick ones or so before dinner , and the red at dinner  --  or the white , if you 're dining with a girl . Then a little touch after the coffee and a couple of long ones and a nightcap , and home at twelve by the old college clock . And all the time you 're talking with somebody you know  --  about their wives , or their husbands , or religion , or the market , or what 's new in the crowd  --  just rational conversation and maybe a little quiet singing , like " Work is the Curse of the Drinking Classes . " Sometimes Mr. Forman sits down and tells one of his long stories , but generally he 'd rather stand at the bar . And sometimes the whole crowd clicks , and sometimes it does n't , and sometimes that Page girl gets started on her imitations . But anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing it again , and it 's warm , and you know the people , and you do n't have to go home . And Angelo 's there , getting a little fatter and sleeker every year , and with a little bigger white edge around his waistcoat . Now and then he 'll set up some strega for you , if he 's feeling right . I do n't like strega myself , but it would hurt his feelings to refuse . And then , in summer , there 's the little back garden , and the fat cat that always has kittens , and the pink shades on the lamps . Rocco will be telling you the fish is ver ' fine  --  and you know it is n't , but who cares ?  --  and you can sit and watch the lights in the skyscrapers and hear the roar of the town , going by outside . You do n't have to think at all . It 's restful that way . I can remember when I used to think a lot . And wonder about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who they were , and why they came , and what they did with the rest of their time . I used top171make up stories about them , going back to the apartment with Evie , and we 'd both get excited over them ; and forget to turn off at our own corner , we were talkingso hard . That was when everybody we met was brand-new and bound to be interesting , and it was fun going to shows together in the gallery and having pancakesafterward at Childs ' . I was always going to write some of those stories down , and she helped me make notes of them . I found the start of the one about Mr. Forman the other day . Well , what was the percentage in keeping it ? I 've seen a good deal of this writing racket since ; and I ought to know what will sell and what wo n't . And anyhow , I 'd just made him an old soak , and he 's really a pretty interesting man . Besides , that 's something you get over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal schedule , you do n't have time . I used to think it was funny  --  meeting peoplethe way you do and having them tell you all sorts of inside things , the way it happens , and yet not . really knowing them or tying them up with anything outside . But that 's stopped bothering me . You just have to let them come and go , or it breaks the charm . Going home to dinner with Jim Hewitt was what cured me , finally . I never met a fellow I liked better at Angelo 's , and we told our real names . So , when he suggested breaking the family bread one evening , I took him up . Good Lord , he lived at Scarsdale and they had three children ! The baby was sounding off like a police siren as we came in , and we had one round of weak orange blossoms before the fodder . Mrs. Hewitt liked orange blossoms . Then , afterward , we sat around and played three-handed bridge and Mrs. Hewitt and Jim discussed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night ; I 'd have had the mimies . Jim was sort of ritzy for a while after that , but he got all right again , finally . I guess they must have hitched up the sled dogs and moved north to White Plains or something , for I have n't seen him in I do n't now how long . Of course , now and then something comes along that you have to take notice of . People get married or divorced , and Angelo will always open a bottle of champagne , no matter which it is , if they 're really old customers . I remember the party the crowd of us gave to cheer up Helen Ashland when she heard about Jake 's remarriage . She certainly took it like a sport  --  we were thinking up funny telegrams to send the bridal couple all evening . I do n't believe she really had hysterics either . That was just Bing Otis ' idea . And she could n't have meant it when she said she hated us  --  she 'd always been the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married again last year  --  somebody was broadcasting about it . If she ever comes back to Angelo 's , I 'll have to get the low-down . That 's another thing about the crowd  --  the way they stick together when anything happens . I 'll never forget the night Ted Harrison went out . Of course , he 'd been going into reverse for quite a while , and whenever he got particularly sunk , he 'd talk about doing a one-way jump through a window ; but we knew Ted and just kidded him along . So when he did do it , after all , it was mean . Anyhow , he had the sense not to stage his act at Angelo 's . P173We went to the service afterward  --  those of us that could . That 's what I mean by all of us sticking together . It was one of those gray winter days , and cold . There was a little boy , and he was crying . I do n't see why they brought him there . I did n't know Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family sort of upstaged us . But we felt we ought to be there ; though it was funny how little you could remember about Ted except parties . Well , there is n't much to those services , the way I look at it . But then we went back to Angelo 's and he was fine . Evie never took to Angelo 's somehow , even at first . She felt she had to like the dinner , because it was cheap , but the atmosphere of the place never really appealed to her . She liked going to places where there was music or where somebody famous might be sitting at the next table . Of course , it was generally an out-of-town buyer or a cloak model , really , but she got just as big a kick out of pretending . We used to have dinner home a lot , too , that first year . It 's wonderful how much food you can get for the money , living like that . Though , of course , it 's really cheaper for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've thought sometimes of getting a regular maid or one of those Japs who just come in and get dinner and clear away . There 'd be money enough , for Evie never would take alimony , and now she 's married again she does n't need it anyway . But then , what would you do after dinner ? You ca n't go to the movies every night in the week , and a man who works all clay needs some relaxation .   When Evie and I were married , we used to go to all sorts of places  --  we even went to museums on Sundaysand to those concerts they have way uptown . But there 's not much point in doing that sort of thing by yourself . And if you start trotting a girl around , why , anybody knows how that finishes . You may not mean to get hooked up together at all , but some little thing happens and you 're in for it , one way or the other . And if it 's one way , you 're bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the other  --  well , I 've been married to Evie , and once is enough . I 'm not going to repeat at my age . This child is too wise . Now , you can see as much of a girl as you like at Angelo 's , and that 's all right because you 're both part of the crowd . You 've got protection , if you see what I mean . And even if you should stop playing for matches , it would n't mean much to either of you . We 're all pretty modern in the crowd and we understand about things like that . Of course , we 've had some fairly wild birds at one time or another , and I do n't say I agree with all the talk I hear . But there 's no use being Victorian , like people were in 19 i o . You just have to be wise . It 's queer , though  --  you certainly could n't call Evie Victorian . And yet she never genuinely fitted in with the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluenose ; she was really awfully pretty and the kind of girl that everybody likes right off . Why , Mr. Forman took a great shine to her and used to come over and sit at our table and tell her how he wished he had a daughter her age . But she just could n't stand him . She said it wasP175the look of his hands . Now , when anybody 's been drinkingfor thirty semesters or so , like Mr. Forman , I think they 're lucky if they have any hands at all . And if they remind you of an alligator-skin hag , you ought to overlook it and be broad-minded . But Evie simply could n't see it that way . She was always wanting us to make friends with other young married people , even when they lived up by Grant 's Tomb , where the climate 's different . Well , that 's all right , but once you go in for that sort of thing , you might as well stay in Waynesburg . That 's what I kept telling her : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is New York . " Let the Weather Bureau worry about the wide-open spaces . But all the same , after she was gone , I found a whole envelope full of real-estate ads  --  you know those mortgage manors with the builtinkiddie coops that all the Westchester cowboys come home to on the 5:49 . Now , can you imagine that in a sensible girl ? So there it was , you see , and we did n't make a go of it . Well , it 's no use crying over spilt giggle water , as they say , and a man has to take things like that in his stride . If he does n't , he 's lost in the shuffle iii this man 's hamlet . I can see it was n't anybody 's fault ; I 'm modern . Maybe if Evie had really liked the crowd  --  but there , I wo n't blame her . She 's happy the way she is , I guess ; and you can see the way I am . The only thing that ever hurts this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sardines or no sardines . But I 'm sure he 'll give me the eye , long enough ahead , if it does . He 's always shot square with me .   Of course , occasionally you get sort of philosophic about this time in the evening , and wonder how things would have turned out if they 'd been different . But I 've almost quit doing that . There 's no percentage in it . I remember Mr. Forman , one of the first times Evie and I were here . She had n't noticed his hands then , and when he got talking to us , we both thought he was a pretty quaint old character . I guess he took to us so because we both of us must have looked young and green . Anyhow , he started philosophizing . " Youth , " he says . " Youth against the city ; coming in every day  --  " Oh , he ought to have had it syndicated ! " I 've watched ' em come , " says he , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some it breaks , and some just dry up gradually till the whitewing sweeps ' em away . Go back to your cornfields , young people , " says he  --  as if Waynesburg did n't have car tracks !  --  " Go back and raise a family of nice little mortgages , because I 'm a bad old man and you 're breaking my heart "  --  and pretty soon he 's crying into his glass . We did n't pay any attention to him . We knew we were going to lick the world . But all the same , there 's something in what he said . This town is a tough spot till you get wise to it  --  and it 's too bad to see a fine man like Mr. Forman going to pieces the way he has these last two years . But then he 's got what I call too much system in his drinking . You have to have just enough so it does n't worry you . Take me . If I 'm stepping out a little more than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course it was bound to happen sometime , the wayp177people come to New York ; but a thing like that is apt to make you a little nervous just the same . It 's easier , being modern the way we are . All the same , when I stepped out of the elevator and saw her waiting where she generally used to wait .. . She had n't come upstairs to the office , and that was decent of her . That girl at the front desk never could see me , and it 's a laugh , your ex-wife ringing you up to pass the time of day or waiting out in the reception room . Though it would n't have been exactly a laugh to me . I 'd thought of all sorts of things to say to her when we did meet , but I did n't say any of them . I even forgot to take off my hat . I just said , " Hello , Evie . I did n't know you were in town , " and she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  and then we stared at each other . I knew her right away , and yet I did n't know her , if you can get that . She was just as pretty as ever , but we were n't married any more . And then , her face was different . It did n't have that sort of quiet look on it when we were married . Of course , she 'd let her hair grow too . She always had pretty hair . It had been five years . Well , there we were . I must have looked like something , for , when we were out on the street she touched me on the ann . " Do n't worry , Dick , " she said . " Everything 's all right . I just thought , as long as I was in New York , it was silly not to see each other . Do you mind ? " " Not a bit , " I said . . . . Well , you have to be polite , have n't you ?   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . That 's Evie 's husband . It 's a funny name . " Oh , he 's fine . . . " she said , " just fine . " " And the children ? " I said . . . . I could n't imagine them . " I suppose they 're fine too ? " " Oh , they 're fine , " she said . " Well , I 'm glad to hear that , Evie , " I said . I do n't know why it was so hard to talk ; we ought to have been used to talking to each other . She looked at me and laughed , quite the way she used to . " We ca n't stand here and gape at each other , Dick , " she said . " That 's right , " I said , so I flagged a taxi and told him Angelo 's . Then I remembered she did n't like Angelo 's . But she was decent and said that it was all right . I 'll hand it to Rocco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't even bat an eye  --  just took the order . We were the only people in the little room .

" " Well , " said I , " you 've been away a long time . " Then we looked at each other and knew we had nothing to say . She made rings with the bottom of the sherry glass . " Oh , Dick , " she said , " it 's all so different from the way I thought it would be . Tell me about yourself . " " Oh , I 'm still at the old stand , " I said . " Same desk , as a matter of fact .

I felt better now , with that old-fashioned inside me , especially as Rocco was bringing another . " Who came from Waynesburg ? " she said , trying to kid me out of it . " Me , " I said . " But you 'll have to admit I 've come a long way . " I do n't know why that made her look as if she wanted to cry . She hardly ever did cry  --  that was one thing about her .

" I am happy , " she said  --  and that 's the hell of it ; I could see she was . " Well , " I said , " skoall "  --  and that was the end of that old-fashioned . I was certainly coming back to normalin grand style . I could feel it creeping all over me . Then I heard her sort of talking to herself . " It was a mistake , " she was saying .

You 'll like them ; they 're really awfully nice people . " " I do n't think I can wait , Dick , " she said . " I 've got to get back to the hotel . I 'm taking the night train . " " Back to Cleveland ? " I said . " Back to Cleveland , " she said . " Well , " I said , " if you must , you must . And I wo n't tell Barris on you . " I felt pretty cheery by now . She looked at me . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " Oh , Dick , Dick ! " she said . " Whatever are you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't stand it . " " If you mean my hair , " I said , " it 's the bather 's fault , not mine . " But she did n't pay any attention . " I did n't come hack to show off , " she said . " Really I did n't . I hoped  --  I really did  --  I 'd come back and find you  --  " " Clean and sober ? " said I. " Well , I 'm all of that . " " I  --  oh , what 's the use ?  --  I even thought you might be married . " " To some nice girl ? " I said . " No , thanks . I 've been . " " I held on as long as I could , " she said . " I 'm not denying it , " said I. " Let 's leave it at that . No hard feelings . " She looked as if she wanted to say a whole lot more . Then she looked around the room and at Rocco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she saw to make her look like that . " No , it would n't have been , " she said , sort of lowp182to herself . " It could n't have been . Good-by , Dick , and thank you . " " The pleasure is all mine , " said I. " Only sorry you wo n't have another . Just a second and I 'll get you a taxi . " But when I 'd settled the bill and got my hat and coat , she was gone . I went back to the little room and sat down again . I did n't feel like thinking , but I could n't help it . For one thing , Evie 's asking about all those people who had been in the crowd  --  why , they 'd just disappeared . And I had n't even realized it . Come to think of it , the only two left of that particular crowd who still came to Angelo 's were Mr. Forman and myself . And what was that novel about that I 'd been going to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , mister . " " You have the right idea , " I said , but when he came in , I made him stay . " Rocco , " I said , " tell me something . How do I look today ? " " Oh , mister look ver ' fine ; seem ver ' well . " That 's the trouble with Rocco . He 's always so darn pleasant . " Do n't two-time me , Rocco , " I said . " Do you rememberwhen I first started coming here ? " " Oh , yes ; remember ver ' well . Mister ver ' good . : ustomer ; ver ' steady customer . Wish we had all like mis-ter . " " Leave that outside , " I said . " Just tell me one thing : Do I look a lot different ? " P183He spread out his hands . " Sure , mister look little different . Why not ? Time pass . Rocco look different too . " " You 're a liar , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . All right , I look different , but how old do I look ? " He spread out his hands again . " Rocco do n't know . Mister maybe forty , forty-one  --  mister in his prime . " " You low snake , " I said . " I 'm thirty-two . " This was serious . " Thirty-two ? That 's right . That 's what Rocco mean "  --  and he grinned . But I did n't feel so funny . " Tell me , Rocco , " I said . " You 've always been a friend of mine . Now be a friend . Tell me honestly . I ) o you think I drink too much ? " Gosh , you could n't get anywhere with him ! He just kept on grinning . " Mister ver ' good customer , " he said ; " ver ' old , ver ' steady customer . Mister carry what he drink vcr ' well . " " I know that ! " I said . I was getting mad by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rocco . I do n't put away half what Mr. Forman does . " " Nobody drink so much as Mr. Forman . Some day Mr. Forman go pop . Rocco ver ' sorry then , for Mr. Forman old customer . " " Well , that 's a swell way of encouraging me . How about yourself , Rocco ? How 's your health ? " " Fine ; thanks , mister . We have new bambino only other day . " " Well , I 'm certainly glad to hear that . But lookhere , Rocco ; you take a snifter  --  "   " Sure . Rocco drink wine  --  strega  --  ver ' good . But Rocco have to work . Ca n't drink alla time . " " I get that . But I work too . " " Sure , mister work . But Rocco work alla time . Rocco have wife , tree bambini ; have to work . Work to go back to Italy , buy trattoria , buy farm , have more bambini , be big man in town . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He would n't talk any more . And the next one did n't go so well , because I 'd started looking at myself in the mirror . Oh , it just shows what a state I was in . And it shows you never ought to go back on your tracks . You know , for a while there I did n't like my face a bit . That 's why I say , modern or not , things like seeing Evie again do n't do you any good . Because , when Mr. Forman came in and touched me on the shoulder , I jumped a mile . And just before I jumped I caught his face in the glass right over mine . I 've apologized to him since , and I guess he 's forgotten it . But they all must have thought I was crazy , running out like that and leaving the money on the table . And all that week I just got crazier and crazier , getting up and taking a cold shower in the mornings , and eating at tearooms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could find whatever became of that novel . One good thing , I did get the room pretty well cleaned up . That woman who comes in never really cleans . But what 's the use of all that when you keep getting the fidgets ? And getting the fidgets makes you think too much . Anyway , one evening it was nice and warm , andP185I thought , " I 'll just take a walk . I ca n't sit here any more . " Well , I did n't have any particular direction in mind , but after a while , sure enough , there I was in front of Angelo 's . Man , you should have seen the welcome they gave me . Angelo set up the drinks himself , and Rocco was grinning all over . " Angelo think we lose our mos ' steady customer , " he said , " but mister come back . I know he conic hack . " And Mr. Forman never said a word about how I 'd acted . He was n't a bit standoffish ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven that night . Now , the only worry I 've got is Angelo 's retiring , as I say . But even if he does , maybe Rocco will keep the place on . Of course , even that would lw a change , but I 'd hardly mind . We 've known each other a long while , and he knows I 'm a good customer . P186TOO EARLY SPRING I 'M writing this down because I do n't ever want to forget the way it was . It does n't seem as if I could , now , but they all tell you things change . And I guess they 're right . Older people must have forgotten or they could n't be the way they are . And that goes for even the best ones , like Dad and Mr. Grant . They try to understand but they do n't seem to know how . And the others make you feel dirty or else they make you feel like a goof . Till , pretty soon , you begin to forget yourself  --  you begin to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that way . " And that 's the end of everything . So I 've got to write this down . Because they smashed it forever  --  but it was n't the way they said . Mr. Grant always says in comp. class : " Begin at the beginning . " Only I do n't know quite where the beginningwas . We had a good summer at Big Lake but it was just the same summer . I worked pretty hard at the practice basket I rigged up in the barn , and I learned how to do the back jackknife . I 'll never dive like Kerry but you want to be as all-around as you can . And , when I took my measurements , at the end of the summer , I was 5 ft. 9% and I 'd gained 12 lbs . 6 oz . That is n't bad for going on sixteen and the old chest expansionwas O. K. You do n't want to get too heavy , because basketball 's a fast game , but the year before was thep187year when I got my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . But this year , Kerry helped me practice , a couple of times , and he seemed to think I had a good chance for the team . So I felt pretty set up  --  they 'd never had a Sophomore on it before . And Kerry 's a natural athlete , so that means a lot from him . He 's a pretty good brother too . Most Juniors at State would n't bother with a fellow in High . It sounds as if I were trying to run away from what I have to write down , but I 'm not . I want to remember that summer , too , because it 's the last happy one I 'll ever have . Oh , when I 'm an old man  --  thirty or forty  --  things may be all right again . But that 's a long time to wait and it wo n't be the same . And yet , that summer was different , too , in a way . So it must have started then , though I did n't know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good time . But , every now and then , it would strike me we were acting like awful kids . They thought . I was getting the big head , but I was n't . It just was n't much fun  --  even going to the cave . It was like going on shooting marbles when you 're in High . I had sense enough not to try to tag after Kerry and his crowd . You ca n't do that . But when they all got out on the lake in canoes , warm evenings , and somebodybrought a phonograph along , I used to go clown to the Point , all by myself , and listen and listen . Maybe they 'd be talking or maybe they 'd be singing , but it all sounded mysterious across the water . I was n't trying to hear what they said , you know . That 's the kind of thing Tot Pickens does . I 'd just listen , with my arms aroundP188my knees  --  and somehow it would hurt me to listen  --  and yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sitting under the four pines , one night , right down by the edge of the water . There was a big moon and they were singing . It 's funny how you can be unhappyand nobody know it but yourself . I was thinking about Sheila Coe . She 's Kerry 's girl . They fight but they get along . She 's awfully pretty and she can swim like a fool . Once Kerry sent me over with her tennis racket and we had quite a conversation . She was fine . And she did n't pull any of this big sister stuff , either , the way some girls will with a fellow 's kid brother . And when the canoe came along , by the edge of the lake , I thought for a moment it was her . I thought maybe she was looking for Kerry and maybe she 'd stop and maybe she 'd feel like talking to me again . I do n't know why I thought that  --  I did n't have any reason . Then I saw it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made her look grown-up , and I felt sore . She did n't have any business out on the lake at her age . She was just a Sophomore in High , the same as me . I chunked a stone in the water and it splashed right by the canoe , but she did n't squeal . She just said , " Fish , " and chuckled . It struck me it was a kid 's trick , trying to scare a kid . " Hello , Helen , " I said . " Where did you swipe the gunboat ? " " They do n't know I 've got it , " she said . " Oh , hello , Chuck Peters . How 's Big Lake ? " " All right , " I said . " How was camp ? "  | " It was peachy , " she said . " We had a peachy counselor , Miss Morgan . She was on the Wellesley fieldhockeyteam . " " Well , " I said , " we missed your society . " Of course we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't swim at our raft . But you ought to be polite . " Thanks , " she said . " Did you do the special reading l or English ? I thought it was dumb . " " It 's always dumb , " I said . " What canoe is that ? " " It 's the old one , " she said . " I 'm not supposed to have it out at night . But you wo n't tell anybody , will you ? " " Be your age , " I said . I felt generous . " I 'll paddle a while , if you want , " I said . " All right , " she said , so she brought it in and I got aboard . She went back in the bow and I took the paddle . I 'm not strong on carting kids around , as a rule . But it was better than sitting there by myself . " Where do you want to go ? " I said . " Oh , back towards the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ought to , really . I just wanted to hear the singing . " " K. O. , " I said . I did n't paddle fast , just let her slip . There was a lot of moon on the water . We kept around the edge so they would n't notice us . The singing sounded as if it came from a different country , a long way off . She was a sensible kid , she did n't ask fool questions or giggle about nothing at all . Even when we went by Petters ' Cove . That 's where the lads from the bungalow colony go and it 's pretty well populated on a warm night . You can hear them talking in low voices and now and then a laugh . Once Tot Pickens and a gang went over there with a flashlight , and a big Bohunk chased them for half a mile . I felt funny , going by there with her . But I said , " Well , it 's certainly Old Home Week "  --  in an offhand tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sophisticated . And she said , " People are funny , " in just the right sort of way . I took quite a shine to her after that and we talked . The Sharons have only been in town three years and somehow I 'd never really noticed her before . Mrs. Sharon 's awfully good-looking but she and Mr. Sharon fight . That 's hard on a kid . And she was a quiet kid . She had a small kind of face and her eyes were sort of like a kitten 's . You could see she got a great kick out of pretending to be grown-up  --  and yet it was n't all pretending . A couple of times , I felt just as if I were talking to Sheila Coe . Only more comfortable , because , after all , we were the same age . Do you know , after we put the canoe up , I walked all the way back home , around the lake ? And most of the way , I ran . I felt swell too . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like finding something . I had n't imagined anybody could ever feel the way I did about some things . And here was another person , even if it was a girl . Kerry 's door was open when I went by and he stuck his head out , and grinned . " Well , kid , " he said . " Stepping out ? " " Sure . With Greta Garbo , " I said , and grinned backP191to show I did n't mean it . I felt sort of lightheaded , with the run and everything . " Look here , kid  --  " he said , as if he was going to say something . Then he stopped . But there was a funny look on his face . And yet I did n't see her again till we were both back in High . Mr. Sharon 's uncle died , back East , and they closed the cottage suddenly . But all the rest of the time at Big Lake , I kept remembering that night and her little face . If I 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . No , it would n't have been . All the same , I was n't even thinking of her when we bumped into each other , the first day of school . It was raining and she had on a green slicker and her hair was curly under her hat . We grinned and said hello and had to run . But something happened to its , I guess . I 'll say this now  --  it was n't like Tot Pickens and Mabel Palmer . It was n't like Junior David and Betty Page  --  though they 've been going together ever since kindergarten . It was n't like any of those things . We did n't get sticky and sloppy . It was n't like going with a girl . Gosh , there 'd be days and days when we 'd hardly see each other , except in class . I had basketball practice almost every afternoon and sometimes evenings and she was taking music lessons four times a week . But you do n't have to be always twos-ing with a person , if you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they 're thinking and feeling , the way you know yourself . Now let me describe her . She had that little face and the eyes like a kitten 's . When it rained , her hair curled all over the back of her neck . Her hair was yellow . She was n't a tall girl but she was n't chunky  --  just . light and well made and quick . She was awfully alive without being nervous  --  she never bit her fingernails or chewed the end of her pencil , but she 'd answer quicker than anyone in the class . Nearly everybody liked her , but she was n't best friends with any particulargirl , the mushy way they get . The teachers all thought a lot of her , even Miss Eagles . Well , I had to spoil that . If we 'd been like Tot and Mabel , we could have had a lot more time together , I guess . But Helen is n't a liar and I 'm not a snake . It was n't easy , going over to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other in front of you and yet there 'd be something wrong . And she 'd have to be fair to both of them and they were always pulling at her . But we 'd look at each other across the table and then it would be all right . I do n't know when it was that we knew we 'd get married to each other , some time . We just started talking about it , one day , as if we always had . We were sensible , we knew it could n't happen right off . We thought maybe when we were eighteen . That was two years but we knew we had to be educated . You do n't get as good a job , if you are n't . Or that 's what people say . We were n't mushy either , like some people . We got to kissing each other good-by , sometimes , because that 's what you do when you 're in love . It was cool , thep193way she kissed you , it was like leaves . But lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , we 'd just play checkers or go over the old Latin , or once in a while go to the movies with the gang . It was really a wonderful winter . I played every game after the first one and she 'd sit in the gallery and watch and I 'd know she was there . You could see her little green hat or her yellow hair . Those are the class colors , green and gold . And it 's a queer thing , but everybody seemed to be pleased . That 's what I ca n't get over . They liked to see us together . The grown people , I mean . Oh , of course , we got kidded too . And old Mrs. Withers would ask me about " my little sweetheart , " in that awful damp voice of hers . But , mostly , they were all right . Even Mother was all right , though she did n't like Mrs. Sharon . I did hear her say to Father , once , " Really , George , how long is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just could n't stand it . " Then Father chuckled and said to her , " Now , Mary , last year you were worried about him because he did n't take any interest in girls at all . " " Well , " she said , " he still does n't . Oh , Helen 's a nice child  --  no credit to Eva Sharon  --  and thank heaven she does n't giggle . Well , Charles is mature for his age too . But he acts so solemn about her . It is n't natural . " " Oh , let Charlie alone , " said Father . " The boy 's all right . He 's just got a one-track mind . " But it was n't so nice for us after the spring came . In our part of the state , it comes pretty late , as a rule . But it was early this year . The little kids were out with scooters when usually they 'd still be having snowfights and , all of a sudden , the radiators in the classrooms smelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months  --  and then , there was a day when you hated it again and everybody kept asking to open the windows . The monitors had a tough time , that first week  --  they always do when spring starts  --  but this year it was worse than ever because it came when you did n't expect it . Usually , basketball 's over by the time spring really breaks , but this year it hit us while we still had three games to play . And it certainly played hell with us as a team . After Bladesburg nearly licked us , Mr. Grant called off all practice till the day before the St. Matthew'sgame . He knew we were stale  --  and they 've been state champions two years They 'd have walked all over us , the way we were going . The first thing I did was telephone Helen . Because that meant there were six extra afternoons we could have , if she could get rid of her music lessons any way . Well , she said , was n't it wonderful , her music teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , that was a great week and we were so happy , We went to the movies five times and once Mrs. Sharon let us take her little car . She knew I did n't have a driving license but of course I 've driven ever since I was thirteen and she said it was all right . She was funny  --  sometimes she 'd be awfully kind and friendly to you and sometimes she 'd be like a piece of dry ice . She was that way with Mr. Sharon too . But it was a wonderfulp195ride . We got stuff out of the kitchen  --  the cook 's awfullysold on Helen  --  and drove way out in the country . And we found an old house , with the windows gone , on top of a hill , and parked the car and took the stuff up to the house and ate it there . There were n't any chairs or tables but we pretended there were . We pretended it was our house , after we were married . I 'll never forget that . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set two places on the floor . " Well , Charles , " she said , sitting opposite me , with her feet tucked under , " I do n't suppose you remember the days we were both in school . " " Sure , " I said  --  she was always much quicker pretendingthings than I was  --  " I remember them all right . That was before Tot Pickens got to be President . " And we both laughed . " It seems very distant in the past to me  --  we 've been married so long , " she said , as if she really believed it . She looked at me . " Would you mind turning off the radio , dear ? " she said . " This modern music always gets on my nerves . " " Have we got a radio ? " I said . " Of course , Chuck . " " With television ? " " Of course , Chuck . " " Gee , I 'm glad , " I said . I went and turned it off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late market reports  --  " she said just like Mrs. Sharon . " Nope , " I said . " The market  --  uh  --  closed firm today . Up twenty-six points . "  | " That 's quite a long way up , is n't it ? " " Well , the country 's perfectly sound at heart , in spite of this damfool Congress , " I said , like Father . She lowered her eyes a minute , just like her mother , and pushed away her plate . " I 'm not very hungry tonight , " she said . " You wo n't mind if I go upstairs ? " " Aw , do n't be like that , " I said . It was too much like her mother . " I was just seeing if I could , " she said . " But I never will , Chuck . " " I 'll never tell you you 're nervous , either , " I said . " I  --  oh , gosh ! " She grinned and it was all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our wedded lives , " she said  --  and everybody knows who runs that family . " We just talk things over calmly and reach a satisfactoryconclusion , usually mine . " " Say , what kind of house have we got ? " " It 's a lovely house , " she said . " We 've got radios in every room and lots of servants . We 've got a regular movie projector and a library full of good classics and there 's always something in the icebox . I 've got a shoe closet . " " A what ? " " A shoe closet . All my shoes are on tipped shelves , like Mother 's . And all my dresses are on those padded hangers . And I say to the maid , Elise , Madam will wear the new French model today . ' " " What are my clothes on ? " I said . " Christmas trees ? " " Well , " she said . " You 've got lots of clothes andP197clogs . You smell of pipes and the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " I said . " I wish I had a dog . It 's a long time since Jack . " " Oh , Chuck , I 'm sorry , " she said . " Oh , that 's all right , " I said . " He was getting old and his ear was always bothering him . But he was a good pooch . Go ahead . " " Well , " she said , " of course we give parties  --  " " Cut the parties , " I said . " Chuck ! They 're grand ones ! " " I 'm a homebody , " I said . " Give me  --  er  --  my wife and my little family and  --  say , how many kids have we got , anyway ? " She counted on her fingers . " Seven . " " Good Lord , " I said . " Well , I always wanted seven . You can make it three , if you like . " " Oh , seven 's all right , I suppose , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way ? " " No , " she said . " We have governesses and tutors and send them to boarding school . " " 0 . K. , " I said . " But it 's a strain on the old man 's pocketbook , just the same . " " Chuck , will you ever talk like that ? Chuck , this is when we 're rich . " Then suddenly , she looked sad . " Oh , Chuck , do you suppose we ever will ? " she said . " Why , sure , " I said . " I would n't mind if it was only a dump , " she said . " I could cook for you . I keep asking Hilda how she makes things . " P198I felt awfully funny . I felt as if I were going to cry . " We 'll do it , " I said . " Do n't you worry . " " Oh , Chuck , you 're a comfort , " she said . I held her for a while . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that way . I know what that 's like too . " It takes so long to get old , " she said . " I wish I could grow up tomorrow . I wish we both could . " " Do n't you worry , " I said . " It 's going to be all right . " We did n't say much , going back in the car , but we were happy enough . I thought we passed Miss Eagles at the turn . That worried me a little because of the driving license . But , after all , Mrs. Sharon had said we could take the car . We wanted to go back again , after that , but it was too far to walk and that was the only time we had the car . Mrs. Sharon was awfully nice about it but she said , thinking it over , maybe we 'd better wait till I got a license . Well , Father did n't want me to get one till I was seventeen but I thought he might come around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen in a jam with her family . That shows how careful I was of her . Or thought I was . All the same , we decided we 'd do something to celebrateif the team won the St. Matthew 's game . We thought it would be fun if we could get a steak and cook supper out somewhere  --  something like that . Of course we could have done it easily enough with a gang , but we did n't want a gang . We wanted to be alone together , the way we 'd been at the house . That wasp199all we wanted . I do n't see what 's wrong about that . We even took home the paper plates , so as not to litter things up . Boy , that was a game ! We beat them 36-34 and it took an extra period and I thought it would never end . that two-goal lead they had looked as big as the Rocky Mountains all the first half . And they gave me the full school cheer with nine Peters when we tied thew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Grant had a kind of spread for the team at his house and a lot of people came in . Kerry had driven down from State to see the game and that made me feel pretty swell . And what made me feel better yet was his taking me aside and saying , " Listen , kid , I do n't want you to get the swelled head , but you did a good job . Well , just remember this . Do n't let anybody kid you out of going to State . You 'll like it up there . " And Mr. Grant heard him and laughed and said , " Well , Peters , I 'm not proselytizing . But your brother might think about some of the Eastern colleges . " It was all like the kind of dream you have when you can do anything . It was wonderful . Only Helen was n't there because the only girls were older girls . I 'd seen her for a minute , right after the game , and she was fine , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that big St. Matthew 's forward and  --  oh , everything . Well , you like to talk things over with your girl . Father and Mother were swell but they had to go on to some big shindy at the country club . And Kerry was going there with Sheila Coe . But Mr. Grant said he'dp200run me back to the house in his car and he did . He 's a great guy . He made jokes about my being the infant phenomenon of basketball , and they were good jokes too . I did n't mind them . But , all the same , when I 'd said good night to him and gone into the house , I felt sort of let down . I knew I 'd be tired the next day but I did n't feel sleepy yet . I was too excited . I wanted to talk to somebody . I wandered around downstairs and wondered if Ida was still up . Well , she was n't , but she 'd left half a chocolate cake , covered over , on the kitchen table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congratulations to Mister Charles Peters . " Well , that was awfully nice of her and I ate some . Then I turned the radio on and got the time signal  --  eleven  --  and some snappy music . But still I did n't fell like hitting the hay . So I thought I 'd call up Helen and then I thoughtprobably she 's asleep and Hilda or Mrs. Sharon will answer the phone and be sore . And then I thought  --  well , anyhow , I could go over and walk around the block and look at her house . I 'd get some fresh air out of it , anyway , and it would be a little like seeing her . So I did  --  and it was a swell night  --  cool and a lot of stars  --  and I felt like a king , walking over . All the lower part of the Sharon house was dark but a window upstairs was lit . I knew it was her window . I went around back of the driveway and whistled once  --  the whistle we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did , and there she was at the window , smiling . She made motions that she 'd come down to the side door . P201Honestly , it took my breath away when I saw her . She had on a kind of yellow thing over her night clothes and she looked so pretty . Her feet were so pretty in those slippers . You almost expected her to be carrying one of those animals kids like  --  she looked young enough . I know I ought n't to have gone into the house . But we did n't think anything about it  --  we were just glad to see each other . We had n't had any sort of chance to talk over the game . ' We sat in front of the fire in the living room and she went out to the kitchen and got its cookies and milk . I was n't really hungry , but it was like that time at the house , eating with her . Mr. and Mrs. Sharon were at the country club , too , so we were n't disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was plenty of light from the fire and Mr. Sharon 's one of those people who ca n't stand having extra lights burning . Dad 's that way about saving string . It was quiet and lovely and the firelight made shadows on the ceiling . We talked a lot and then we just sat , each of us knowing the other was there . And the room got quieter and quieter and I 'd told her about the game and I did n't feel excited or jumpy any more  --  just rested and happy . And then I knew by her breathing that she was asleep and I put my arm around her for just a minute . Because it was wonderful to hear that quiet breathing and know it was hers . I was going to wake her in a minute . I did n't realize how tired I was myself . And then we were back in that house in the countryand it was our home and we ought to have been happy . But something was wrong because there still was n't any glass in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shut the doors but they would n't shut . It drove Helen distracted and we were both running through the house , trying to shut the doors , and we were cold and afraid . Then the sun rose outside the windows , burning and yellow and so big it covered the sky . And with the sun was a horrible , weeping voice . It was Mrs. Sharon 's saying , " Oh , my God , oh my God . " I did n't know what had happened , for a minute , when I woke . And then I did and it was awful . Mrs. Sharon was saying " Oh , Helen  --  I trusted you . . . and looking as if she were going to faint . And Mr. Sharon looked at her for a minute and his face was horribleand he said , " Bred in the bone , " and she looked as if he 'd hit her . Then he said to Helen  --  I do n't want to think of what they said . I do n't want to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bad man . And she is a bad woman , even if she is Helen 's mother . All the same , I could stand the things he said better than hers . I do n't want to think of any of it . And it is all spoiled now . Everything is spoiled . Miss Eagles saw us going to that house in the country and she said horrible things . They made Helen sick and she has n't been back at school . There is n't any way I can see her . And if I could , it would be spoiled . We 'd be thinking about the things they said . I do n't know how many of the people know , at school . But Tot Pickens passed me a note . And , thatp203afternoon . I caught him behind his house . I 'd have broken his nose if they had n't pulled me off . I meant to . Mother cried when she heard about it and Dad took me into his room and talked to me . Ile said you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tike Tot Pickens . Dad and Mother have been all right . But they say things about Helen and that 's almost worse . ' They 're for me because I 'm their son . But they do n't understand . I thought I could talk to Kerry but I ca n't . I lc was nice but he looked at me such a funny way . I do n't know  --  sort of impressed . It was n't the way I wanted him to look . But he 's been decent . He conies down almost every weekend and we play catch in the yard . You see , I just go to school and back now . They want me to go with the gang , the way I did , but 1 ca n't do that . Not after Tot . Of course my mat ks are a lot better because I 've got more time to study now . But it 's lucky I have n't got Miss Eagles though Dad made her apologize . I could n't recite to her . I think Mr. Grant knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a conversation . Not about that , though I was terribly afraid he would . he showed me a lot of his old college things and the gold football he wears on his watch chain . He 's got a lot of interestingthings . Then we got talking , somehow , about history and it things like that and how times had changed . Why , there were kings and queens who got married younger than Helen and me . Only now we lived longer and had a lot more to learn . So it could n't happen now . " It'sp204civilization , " he said . " And all civilization 's against nature . But I suppose we 've got to have it . Only sometimes it is n't easy . " Well somehow or other , that made me feel less lonely . Before that I 'd been feeling that I was the only person on earth who 'd ever felt that way . I 'm going to Colorado , this summer , to a ranch , and next year , I 'll go East to school . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I work hard enough , though it is n't as big a game in the East as it is with us . Well , I 'd like to show them something . It would be some satisfaction . He says not to be too fresh at first , but I wo n't be that . It 's a boy 's school and there are n't even women teachers . And , maybe , afterwards , I could be a professionalbasketball player or something , where you do n't have to see women at all . Kerry says I 'll get over that ; but I wo n't . They all sound like Mrs. Sharon to me now , when they laugh . They 're going to send Helen to a convent  --  I found out that . Maybe they 'll let me see her before she goes . But , if we do , it will be all wrong and in front of people and everybody pretending . I sort of wish they do n't  --  though I want to , terribly . When her mother took her upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at me as if she was afraid of me . And no matter what they do for us now , they ca n't fix that.  | WHEN he said good night to his son and Tom Drury and the rest of them , Lane Parrington walked down the steps of the Leaf Club and stood , for a moment , breathing in the night air . He had made the speech they 'd asked him to make , and taken pains with it , too  --  but now he was wondering whether it was n't the same old graduate 's speech after all . Ile had n't meant it to be so , but you ran into a lingo , once you started putting thoughts on paper  --  you began to view with alarm and talk about imperiled bulwarks and the American way of life . And yet he 'd been genuinely pleased when the invitationcame  --  and they 'd asked him three months ahead . That meant something , even to the Lane Farringtonof United Investments  --  it was curious how old bonds held . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there was the place in Virginia , the place on Long Island , the farm in Vermont and the big apartment on the river . There were the statements issued when sailing for Europe and the photographs and articles in news weekliesand magazines . And yet he had been pleased when they asked him to speak at the annual dinner of an undergraduate club in his own college . Of course , the Leaf was a little different , as all Leaf members knew . P206When he had been a new member , as his son was now , the speech had been made by a Secretary of State . Well , he 'd done well enough , he supposed  --  at least Ted had come up , afterward , a little shyly , and said , " Well , Dad , you 're quite an orator . " But , once or twice , in the course of the speech , he had caught Ted fiddling with his coffee spoon . They were almost always too long  --  those speeches by graduates  --  he had tried to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not after he 'd got up and seen them waiting there . They were only boys , of course , but boys who would soon be men with men 's responsibilities  --  he had even made a point of that . One of the things about the Leaf  --  you got a chance of hearing what  --  well , what really important men thought of the state of the world and the state of the nation . They could get a lot from professors but hardly that . So , when a sensible fellow got up to explain what sensible men really thought about this business at Washington  --  why , damn it , nobody was going to ring a gong on him ! And they 'd clapped him well , at the end , and Ted 's face had looked relieved . They always clapped well , at the end . Afterward , he had rather hoped to meet Ted 's friends and get in a little closer touch with them than he did at the place in Virginia or the place on Long Island or the apartment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they got in cars and out of cars , they dressed and went to dances , they played on the tennis courts and swam in the pool . They were a good crowd  --  a typical Leaf crowd , well-exercised and well/mannered . They were polite to Cora and polite to him . He offered them cigars now and then ; during the last two years he offered them whisky and soda . They listened to what he had to say and , if he told a good story , they usually laughed at it . They played tennis with him , occasionally , and said , " Good shot , sir ! "  --  afterward , they played harder tennis . One of them was Ted , his son , well-mannered , well-exercised , a member of the Leaf . He could talk to Ted about college athletics , the college curriculum , his allowance , the weather , the virtues of capitalism and whether to get a new beach wagon this summer . Now , to these subjects was added the Leaf and the virtues of the Leaf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , sometimes when the annual dinner was over , there would be a little group at the Leaf around this graduate or that . He remembered one such group his senior year , around a sharp-tongued old man with hooded eyes . The ex-senator was old and broken , but they 'd stayed up till two while his caustic voice made hay of accepted catchwords . Well , he had ' net Ted 's friends and remembered most of their navies . They had congratulated him on his speech and he had drunk a highball with them . It had all been in accord with the best traditions of the Leaf but it had n't lasted very long . For a moment , indeed , he had almost gotten into an argument with one of them  --  the pink-faced , incrediblyyouthful one with the glasses who was head of the Student Union  --  they had n't had student unions in his time . He had been answering a couple of ques/tions quite informally , using slang , and the pink-faced youth had broken in with , " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good speech you made from the conservative point of view and all that  --  but when you talk about labor 's being made responsible , just what do you mean and how far do you go ? Do you mean you want to scrap the Wagner Act or amend it or what ? " But then the rest of them had said , " Oh , do n't mind Stu  --  he 's our communist . Skip it , Stu  --  how 's dialectic materialism today ? " and it had passed off in kidding . Lane Parrington felt a little sorry about that  --  he would have enjoyed a good argument with an intelligentyoungster  --  he was certainly broad-minded enough for that . But , instead , he 'd declined another highball and said , well , he supposed he ought to be gettingback to the inn . It had all been very well-mannered and in accord with the best traditions of the Leaf . He wondered how the old ex-senator had got them to talk . Ted had offered to walk along with him , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he stood for a moment on the sidewalk , wondering whether he ought to look in at class headquarters before going back to the inn . He ought to , he supposed  --  after all , it was his thirtieth reunion . It would be full of cigar smoke and voices and there would be -a drunk from another class  --  there was always , somehow or other , a drunk from another class who insisted on leading cheers . And Schooner Fairchild , the class funny man , would be tellingstories  --  the one about the Kickapoo chief , the one about President Dodge and the telephone . As it was in the beginning , is now and ever shall be . He did n't dis-P209like Schooner Fairchild any more  --  you could n't dislike a man who had wasted his life . But Schooner , somehow , had never seemed conscious of that . Yes , he 'd go to class headquarters  --  he 'd go , if for no other reason than to prove that he did not dislike Schooner Fairchild . He started walking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there had been only eight in his time . They all looked very much alike , even the new ones  --  it took an initiated eye to detect the slight enormous differences  --  to know that Wampum , in spite of its pretentious lanterns , was second-rate and would always be second-rate , while Abbey , small and dingy , ranked with Momus and the Leaf . Parrington stood still , reliving the moment of more than thirty years ago when he 'd gotten the hied from Wampum and thought he would have to accept it . It had n't been necessary  --  the Leaf messenger had knocked on his door at just three minutes to nine . But whenever he passed the Wampum house he remembered . For , for almost an hour , it had seemed as if the destined career of Lane Parrington was n't going to turn out right after all . The small agonies of youth  --  they were unimportant , of course , but they left a mark . And he 'd had to succeed  --  he 'd had to have the Leaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money  --  he was n't a Schooner Fairchild , to take things as they came . You were geared like that or you were n't  --  if you were n't , you might as well stay in Emmetsburg and end up as a harried high school principal with sick headaches and a line Spencerian handwriting , as his father had . But he had wanted top210get out of Emmetsburg the moment he had realized there were other places to go . He remembered a look through a microscope and a lashing , tailed thing that swam . There were only two classes of people , the wigglers and the ones who stood still  --  he should have made his speech on that  --  it would have been a better speech . And the ones who stood still did n't like the wigglers  --  that , too , he knew , from experience . If they saw a wiggler coming , they closed ranks and opposed their large , well-mannered inertia to the brusque , ill-mannered life . Later on , of course , they gave in gracefully , but without real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a very good record it had had to be . He had even spent three painfulseasons with the track squad , just to demonstrate that desirable all-aroundness that was one of the talking points . And even so , they had smelled it  --  they had known , instinctively , that he was n't quite their kind . Tom Drury , for instance , had always been pleasant enough  --  but Tom Drury had always made him feel that he was talking a little too much and a little too loud . Tom Drury , who , even then , had looked like a magnificent sheep . But he had also been class president , and the heir to Drury and Son . And yet , they all liked Schooner Fairchild  --  they liked him still . And here was the end of Club Row , and the Momus House . He stopped and took out a cigar . It was silly to fight old battles , especially when they were won . If they asked the Drurys to dinner now , the Drurys came  --  he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had helped Tom out with some ofP211their affiliates and Tom had needed help  --  Tom would always be impressive , of course , but it took more than impressiveness to handle certain things . And now Ted was coming along  --  and Ted was sound as a bell . So sound he might marry one of the Drury daughters , if he wanted  --  though that was Ted 's business . He wondered if he wanted Ted to marry young . Ile had ( lone so himself  --  on the whole , it had been a mistake . Funny , how things mixed in your mind . As always , when he remembered Dorothy , there was the sharp , sweet smell of her perfume ; then the stubborn , competentlook of her hands on the wheel of a car . " They had been too much alike to have married  --  lucky they 'd found it out in time . She had let him keep the child  --  of course he would have fought for it anyway  --  but it was considered very modern in those days . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  afterward , he had married Cora . And that had worked out as it should  --  Ted was fond of her and she treated him with just the right shade of companionableness . Most things worked out in the end . He wondered if Dorothy had gotten what she wanted at last  --  he supposedshe had , with her Texan . But she 'd ( lied in a hospital at Galveston , ten years ago , trying to have the Texan 's child , so he could n't ask her now . They had warned her about having more children  --  but , as soon as you warned Dorothy about anything , that was what she wanted to do . He could have told them . But the Texan was one of those handsome , chivalrous men . Strange , that out of their two warring ambitions should have come the sound , reliable , healthy Ted . But ,   no , it was n't strange  --  he had planned it as carefully as one could , and Cora had helped a great deal . Cora never got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the very best nurses and schools from the very first  --  and there you were ! You did it as you rare a business  --  picked the right people and gave them authority . He had hardly ever had to interfere himself . There would be a great deal of money  --  but that could be taken care of  --  there were ways . There were trust funds and foundations and clever secretaries . And Ted need never realize it . There was no reason he should  --  no reason in the least . Ted could think he was doing it all . He pulled hard on his cigar and started to walk away . For the door of the Momus Club had suddenly swung open , emitting a gush of light and a small , chubby , gray-haired figure with a turned-up nose and a jack-o ' - lantern grin . It stood on the steps for a moment , saying good night a dozen times and laughing . Lane Parrington walked fast  --  but it was no use . He heard pattering footsteps behind him  --  a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lane Parrington , b'gosh ! " He stopped and turned . " Oh , hello , Schooner , " he said , unenthusiastically . " Your dinner over , too ? " " Oh , the boys 'll keep it up till three , " said Schooner Fairchild , mopping his pink brow . " But , after an hour and a half , I told them it was time they got some other poor devil at the piano . I 'm not as young as I was . " He panted , comically , and linked arms with Lane Parring/ton . " Class headquarters ? " he said . " I should n't go  --  Minnie will scalp me . But I will . " " Well , " said Lane Parrington uncomfortably  --  he hated having his arm held , " I suppose we ought to look in . " " Duty , Mr. Easy , always duty , " said Schooner Fairchildand chuckled . " Hey , do n't walk so fast  --  an old man ca n't keep up with you . " He stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " that 's a tine boy of yours , Lane . " " Oh , " said Lane Parrington awkwardly . " Thanks . But I did n't know  --  " Saw something of him last summer , " said Schooner Fairchild cheerfully . " Sylvia brought him around to the house . He could have a rather nice baritone , it he wanted . " " Baritone ? " said Lane Parrington . " Sylvia ? " " Eldest daughter and pride of the Fairchild chateau , " said Schooner Fairchild , slurring his words by a tiny fraction . " She collects ' em  --  not always  --  always with Father 's approval . But your boy 's a nice boy . Serious , of course . " He chuckled again , it seemed to Lane Parrington maddeningly . " Oh , the sailor said to the admiral , and the admiral said he  --  " he chanted . " Remember that one , Lane ? " " No , " said Lane Parrington . " That 's right , " said Schooner Fairchild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute , you 'd been in the quartet . But that was dear old Pozzy Banks . Poor Pozzy  --  he never could sing ' The Last Rose of Summer ' properly till he was as drunk as an owl . A man of great talents . I hoped he 'd be here this time but he could n't make it . He wanted to come , " he hummed , " but he did n't have the fare ... " " That 's too bad , " said Lane Parrington , seriously , " And yet , with business picking up . . . " Schooner Fairchild looked at him queerly , for an instant . " Oh , bless you ! " he said . " Pozzy never had a nickel . But he was fun . " He tugged at Lane Parrington'sarm , as they turned a corner and saw an electric sign  --  1908  --  above the door . " Well , here we go ! " he said . An hour later , Lane Parrington decided that it was just as he had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . But others , from other classes , had arrived . And Schooner Fairchild was sitting at the piano . He himself was wedged uncomfortably at the back of the room between Ed Runner and a man whose name , he thought , was either Ferguson or Whitelaw , but who , in any case , addressed him as " Lane , old boy . " This made conversation difficult , for it was hard to call his neighbor either " Fergy " or " Whitey " without being sure of his name . On the other hand , conversation with Ed Runner was equally difficult , for that gentleman had embarked upon an interminable reminiscence whose point turned upon the exact location of Bill Webley 's room Sophomore year . As Lane Parrington had never been in any of Bill Webley 's rooms , he had very little to add to the discussion . He was also drinkingbeer , which never agreed with him , and the cigar smoke stung his eyes . And around the singer and theP215piano boiled and seethed a motley crew of graduates of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripes of 1935 , the shorts and explorers ' helmets of 1928 . For the news had somehow gone around , through the various class headquarters , that Schooner Fairchild was doing his stuff  --  and , here and there , among the crowd , were undergraduates , who had heard from brothers and uncles about Schooner Fairchild , but had never seen him before in the flesh . He had told the story of the Kickapoo chief , he had given the imitation of President Dodge and the telephone . Both these and other efforts , Lane Parrington noted wonderingly , had been received with tumultuous cheers . Now he played a few chords and swung around on the piano stool . " I shall now , " he said , with his cherubic face very solemn , " emit my positively last and final number  --  an imitation of dear old Pozzy Banks , attempting to sing ' The Last Rose of Summer ' while under the influence of wine . Not all of you have been privileged to know dear old Pozzy  --  a man of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is not with us tonight . But for those of you who were not privileged to know Pozzy , may I state as an introduction that dear old Pozzy is built something on the lines of a truck , and that , when under the influence of wine , it was his custom to sing directly into his hat , which he held out before him like a card tray . We will now begin . " He whirled round , struck a few lugubrious notes and began to sing . It was , as even Lane Parrington had to admit ,
