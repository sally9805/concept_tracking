TH ERE is no image of a people thinking . Never- theless , under certain conditions , it may be visible . In the bookstore there is n table indicated for Business , Finance and Economics . Five years ago you would have found there some dreary textbooks , several titles on the economic consequences of the peace , a work on cost accounting , something on scientific management , a survey of recent economic changes  --  and then many books out of place , history , travel , biography , science , these having overflowed from other tables . Now it is the other way . The economic titles are the ones that spill over . They are a flood , uncontrollably rising ; and that it is a flood really , not a stream with amiable and customary sources , you may know by the strangeness of the matter in suspense and what happens to it . Books that were current yesterday have already settled ; they form a deposit at . the bottom . The newer ones on the surface are in jackets of still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger type , and they are thinner , too , because there is less and less time for an idea to grow . There is hardly time for it to sprout . It is curious to see books by one author lying two or three deep in the deposit with a later one in very active suspense on the surface . The Tangled Matter of Our Thoughts T HE list of contributors begins with the President . He has one book in the deposit and one on the sur  --  face . The current one is entitled On Our Way . There is one by a member of the United States Supreme Court , entitled The Curse of Bigness , and that was something the flood tore up from the bottom of an old stream and brought on . Other contributors are members of the Cabinet , some of them two or three books each ; members of the Brain Trust , economists radical and conservative , professional writers be  --  come amateur economists , speculators , engineers , journalists , Utopians , chemists , mathematicians , artists , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself and by his publisher to have discovered the very plan of truth . Whatever is or ever was is challenged ; also many things that are not and never were . The New Deal is challenged on the grounds both that it is communistic and that it is capitalistic . America is challenged to do or not to do ; civilization is challenged to be or not to be . Then there are books purporting to tell what all the others are about , books offering to give you a bird's-eye view of bewilderment , books that promise to confine themselves to the innocent facts , primer books of the A B C type on what everybody wants to know . Paper has never yet refused to receive printing , and there comes a time when any plausible lunacy may have the momentary ecstasy to dress itself in type . These are permissible reflections and not very important . No more important than the impish , ironic pamphlets drifting in the eddies of the flood . All this material of thought , half-thought and idea in restless movement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zeal of conviction , the spirit of revelation or the excitement of discov  --  ery . What have these last discovered ? A new eco  --  nomic world complete , or the hitherto unidentified principle of evil that ruined the old one , or a way to go forward on faith , or it may be the Golden Rule itself . If you could choose your world and depart , or the way you would go and get going , there would be at least an escape . But you can not do either . The world you might choose does not exist but in thought ; it can not be proved but by assertion . Before anybody can go there , it has to be created . And the way you might elect to go  --  forward on faith  --  is a way you can not go alone . Everybody must consent to go . Briefly , we are thinking . We have stopped to think out loud , and here on the table indicated for Busi  --  ness , Finance and Economics is the tangled matter of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confusion ; and it is utter confusion , wherein the experts trained to think in this stuff  --  the economists , that is to say  --  disagree with all the violence that is possible in their remote language , and wherein it happens that one New Dealer may singe the beard of another . The fundamentalists , now called the Old Dealers , have made their contributions , too , under the disadvantage of colorless titles and dull jackets . But their fundamentalism turns out to con  --  sist in a certain precision of ominous statement . These , at least , you might reasonably expect to see all in one way what it was that happened . Even that is not so . Sifting Out the Grain of Truth H OW strange are the uses of confusion ! Somewhere in this cerebral uproar lies the inevitability of a working conclusion to go on with . Intelligence may not be able to recognize it beforehand . That is to say , it may be a conclusion arrived at not by reason alone , nor by reason at all , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thought of ; the imagination must have suggested it along with all the other possibilities that will at last be rejected . Therefore , all this thinking is a necessary process , and so deserves to be attentively examined . The behavior of the aggregate mind is probably , in large , the same as that of the individual mind when involved in a desperate dilemma . It will go round and round looking for an easy way out. ; if the situa  --  tion is bad enough , it will entertain any phantasy of miraculous deliverance , examine any fallacy , ration  --  alize what it would believe , and steadily for a long time avert its gaze from reality . At an impasse with itself , rational and irrational by turns , it will revolve ideas that it secretly knows at the time to be false and delirious and such as it may afterward review with astonishment , saying , " Certainly , I was not then myself . " Yet one was oneself at that time . Only the circumstances have changed . In a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // but each in its own way ; nor will two nations , in a groat social or political emergency , behave in the same way , but each according to its own gowns . It follows , in the case of either the individual mind or the aggregate mind , that extremes of thought and idea will be knowable to one another , and that for all the apparent antagonisms of design and feature , still deeply there is among them all some implicit nature in common . This must be so for the reason , first , that they belong all alike to one total character , and for the reason , furthermore , that they represent only the various ways that may be imagined by that one mind in keeping with that one total character to achieve a single thing . What is that single thing ? It is to settle a conflict between , on the one hand , reality , and , on the other hand , what is believed , what is desired and what ought to be true . The difficulty is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ought to be . That is the cause of the neurosis . Hopes , ideals and cherished delusions give rise to the feeling of what ought to be , and when that feeling comes to a crisis with detrimental reality , first rational thinking tries to save it , and if rational thinking can not save it completely , then irrational thought and ideas will be called up to defend it . Wherefore all thinking in this situation , sound and unsound , has at least the common character of being defensive . If the analogy be true , then one would expect to find what at first must seem very improbable  --  namely , anything in common be tween the extremes , or between either extreme and the middle , of that flood of printed confusion taken to represent a nation think  --  ing out loud on its troubles . Yet that may be found . To begin with , it has in common three qualities . They are heat , rancor and intolerance . And by this you may know three things : First , that all airs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really sure never write like that ; second , that we are not thinking economics at all , because you no more think eco  --  nomics than you think arithmetic . with heat , rancor and intolerance ; and , third , that we are engaged in the most difficult , the most highly civilized and , perhaps , at the same time the most dangerous task to which a modern so  --  ciety may intend its mind , and that is government by discussion . Bagehot , in his Physics and Politics , has a fine passage on the dangers of it . He has been speak  --  ing of its great merits , how it is the only way to disen  --  cumber the present of the past , how prolific it is of ideas ; but then suddenly he says it must . have been the ruin of many of the early free states . Their small size made them always liable to easy destruction from without , yet their internal frailty was even greater , because : " As soon as discussion begins , the savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  munities , where those propensities , too , have been weakened by ages of culture , and repressed by ages of obedience , as soon as a vital topic for discussion is well started , the keenest and most violent passions break forth . Easily destroyed as are early free states by forces from without , they are even more liable to destruction by forces from within . On this account such states are very rare in history . " Immutable Economic Laws T HAT our discussion , through the whole of its arc , from the place of the radical at the extreme left to that of the conservative at the extreme right , does possess in common these three qualities of heat , rancor and intolerance , would not in itself be a sig  --  nificant present fact , merely a historical fact , accord  --  ing to Bagehot . But what will further appear , through the same whole arc , are similarities of as  --  sumption , premise and delusion . Take it that we are conducting government by discussion . What are we discussing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the com  --  mon assumption , and it is not so . Wanting is a sense of distinction between what is economic and what is political . The simple laws of economics are no more debatable than the laws of mechanical power . They are both immutable and have both been deduced in the same way from human experience attentively observed . You may employ the laws of mechanical power as well for creative purposes as for destruc  --  tion , in peace or in war , and they are still the same . Just as little difference does it make to the primary economic laws whether you employ them in a social system called Communism , in one called Fascism or in another called Democracy . They can not change . To produce the least amount of wealth necessary to sustain life , a people ( Continued on Page 36 ) s ( Continued from Page 34 ) of salt , four eggs , a pint . of milk , half a cup of melted butter . You 'll find every waffle expert varies that a trifle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far . But a waffle iron , like most specialized instruments , takes a little handling . Most people are scared of it to begin with , because it looks more like a medieval instru  --  ment of torture than anything to cook with . And then , to complicate matters , it takes a little breaking in , like a new pipe . The first round of waffles baked on an iron that has n't been used for some lime will be a little funny , do what you may . But stay with it and treat it properly , and you 'll get re  --  sults . Incidentally , if you use an elec  --  tric waffle iron , never grease it after it 's once broken in . While the Iron Is Hot Be sure and heat the iron thoroughly on both sides before you pour the bat  --  ter in , and do n't try to grease it with lumps of butter or whatever you use . Melt the stuff and use a small brush to spread it very evenly and thinly . But you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a couple of rounds without greasing again . You 'll be nervous if you never tried waffles before , but anybody with cook  --  ing instinct can get the hang of it pretty soon , and believe me , it 's worth while . Sweet things with waffles are the popular things , and deservedly so . Maple sirup does fine , strained honey does even better  --  I could n't keep you away from those two at the point of a gun , even if I wanted to . And there 's a good deal of sense in serving softened butter with them , so that hard butter wo n't crush the cleats in being spread . But you also owe yourself some of the must more or less exert themselves . That is labor . To produce wealth be  --  yond that minimum they must possess a surplus of labor , a surplus of materi  --  als and a surplus of imagination . When two or more run their exertions to  --  gether to perform one task only , in a specialized , repetitive manner , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to produce in the same time working individually at the same task , or working at it occa  --  sionally in alternation with other tasks . This is the division of labor ; it is also the beginning of mass production , which is older than machines and does not absolutely require machines . But those who engage in mass production , working always at one task exclusively , cease to be self-sustaining by their own exertions . They produce a surplus of one thing . They can not live by one thing . Therefore , they must exchange the surplus of that one thing for every other thing they require . Then business appears . Exchange is business . We now use the word " business " to mean also industry , as strictly we ought not to do , because it involves a confusion of ideas . There was business before there was industry or any organized scheme of production . The uses of busi  --  ness require market places , compara  --  tive values , prices , a medium of ex  --  change , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we call a money economy , meaning that very highly subtleties that got us into such a rush of waffles to the abdomen back at Rec  --  tor 's in the good old days . You see , we wanted some tasty little extra to give the guests free of charge  --  hospitable gesture  --  sort of a drink on the house , so to speak  --  and hit on waffles as something everybody was sure to like . We corralled a lady from Virginia who could make champion  --  ship waffles in a trance with her hands tied behind her , and turned her loose . Her waffles alone would have pro  --  duced a riot , but we practically guar  --  anteed getting ourselves into traffic complications by thinking up special things to go with them  --  whipped cream and berries was one idea , choco  --  late sauce was another  --  and , for peo  --  ple who clung to maple , we shaved maple sugar into thick cream and heated up the cream till the sugar melted . Try that sometime when you 've stopped worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were won  --  dering what had hit us . We 'd planned the thing as a mere detail , a bonne bouche for the customer , who would naturally be tickled at getting some  --  thing swell that did no damage to the bill . But the waffle business boomed us off our feet . People ate the free order and sent the waiter scrambling off for more . We had to get the lady from Virginia a couple of assistants and install a battery of waffle irons that stretched from here to yonder , all hot at once , all turning out waffles the way a newspaper press turns out the five-star final . And , since we by no means gave them away after the first sample , our little gracious gesture turned into one of the most profitable deals we ever got into . But there are a lot more variations you can play on the waffle theme be  --  sides those that swamped Rector's. evolved state of society in which no  --  body lives by individual exertion but by collaboration , and everybody must buy and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he pro  --  duces  --  will be in debt to society for the difference . Who sells more than he buys  --  consumes less than he pro  --  duces  --  will have a credit with society , and will , if it is permitted , grow rich . How will he grow rich ? Having re  --  ceived money for the whole of his con  --  tribution to society 's total product of wealth , instead of spending all the money , he will save it , hoard it , put it in a bank or invest it at interest . Those are the simple laws . Nearly everything else is abstraction , refinement or degree . The Dragon Myth Whether anyone shall be permitted to grow rich , whether there shall be unlimited private rights in wealth or none at all , how the product of a so  --  ciety 's total exertions shall be divided among its members and classes , who shall own the tools of production , who shall control money and credit , whether production and prices shall be regu  --  lated by free competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the profit motive shall act or state tyranny in place of it  --  and that is the only alter  --  native  --  such as these are not economic questions . They are social questions and belong to politics . For instance , the magnificent Southern custom of serving them without sweets , as the sparring partners of turkey , or chicken , hash , or creamed chicken , or kidneys , or chipped beef . And the same thing goes for griddle cakes of any variety . Did you ever decorate your interior with fried ham and buckwheat cakes , using the pan gravy for the cakes , or , even better , with the ham gravy creamed ? It 's an experience which will make you have your sweet tooth painlessly extracted the next day . 1,1 Sidetrack for Sirup Not that you wo n't often find waffles or griddle cakes coupled in the betting with bacon or sausages or creamed chicken on bills of fare . But the wooden-headed proprietors will al  --  ways serve sirup along with them , and so encourage that prevalent sacrilege of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must have something sweet , do n't let it stray off the reservation . Side dishes were invented to take care of foods that go well together but do n't any more belong in the same receptacle than Russian dressing and chocolate cake . . . I am saddened because I have ob  --  served that several of my friends have been doing some of this swabbing of bacon and sausage round in the sirup that accompanied flapjacks . But I 'll forgive them . In fact , I 'm so broad-minded that I never found but one way I could n't eat waffles . And that was the fault of a charming lady at whose house I once spent a week-end . She had a Russian complex and had heard of bkinia  --  and we got waffles with whipped cream and caviar  --  for breakfast at nine o'clock in the morning . This , therefore , is the first simplifi  --  cation . We are discussing not economic solutions but social and political ques  --  tions and thinking out loud about them . What those questions are will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion are further pursued . These now go deeper . Consider haw all the ways of our thinking have been influenced by the power and authority of the dragon myth , representing the depression as a thing to be slain  --  a thing we could slay almost at one stroke , easily , if only we knew how . The principal difference be  --  tween this dragon of ours and the never-seen dragon of people in a state of primitive superstition thousands of years ago is that theirs was supposed to be a physical monster , whereas ours is a raging abstraction that devours our prosperity and happiness by day and by night . It is the popular myth and stands almost unquestioned . We wish to believe it , for , of course , if it is true , then there is an easy way out  --  again , if only we can think of it . The quarreling , therefore , is all about how to slay the dragon . The first thought was to blast it by incantation and propaganda . That failed . The dragon flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , phylac  --  teries , ingenious measures both offen  --  sive and protective , were thought of . The dragon was said to feed on gold ( Continued on Page 38 ) According to recent medical findings much of the so-called " indigestion , " from which so many of us suffer , is really acid indigestion  --  a condition brought on by a preponderance of acid-forming foods in our daily diet . Starches , sweets , meat all come under this heading . All necessary energy foods ; but all acid-forming . Too much of these foods may foster an excess amount of acids in the stomach , and make them  --  selves felt in pain , nausea , " gas , " soon after eating . If you cat these foods , and suffer with " acid indigestion " or occasional stomach upsets , do n't worry about it . Your doctor will tell you there is a simple way now to relieve it . A way that provides relief often in the space of minutes ! ( Continued from Page 36 ) money . Therefore , we abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper money , on the chance that if he ate that it would make him sick . Then it seemed that he fed also upon surplus and we destroyed our surplus . The next discovery was that he fattened on debtors , whereupon we began to relieve debtors of their debts , thinking that way to fool him . But all the time , besides everything else , he devoured credit as a staple of diet , and we could think of nothing better to do about that than to create new credit faster than he could consume it ; and this the Government undertook to do . Where did he live  --  this monster ? Where was he to be seen ? He was no  --  where to be seen because he was an abstraction ; but it came to be common knowledge that he inhabited every region of low prices . Therefore , it seemed that the gigantic means would be to elevate all price regions , for then he would have no place to live . Then at length came the idea of a St. George to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , at any cost to slay the dragon , and if he could do it he would be hero . Meanwhile , as you might expect , vari  --  ous measures whereby to propitiate the dragon are proposed . One is to feed him the profit motive alive ; an  --  other is to sacrifice the rich . The pro  --  ponents guarantee that if either , or preferably both , of these rites are per  --  formed , the dragon will surely go away . Magic That Did Not Work The existence of the devouring ab  --  straction , our dragon , is precisely as improbable as the existence of an easy way out of depression . But although rationally we may know that , still , emotionally , we may disbelieve it . All alike we open the book of trouble at 1929 and say , " There the depression began , " as if it were something that had happened to us out of our fate , a visitation , a dragon come suddenly into our woods to destroy our prosper  --  ity and happiness . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loath to face the fact that it . is with us as it was with the primitive tribe  --  namely , that each man is his own dragon . All the phenomena of depression are effects . All cause was before . The time of cause was when we were leaving our work undone and departing from our common sense to run after rainbows , everyone trying to seize more of the fabulous future for himself than he could hold , and trying , besides , to pledge it at the bank for money with which to gratify immediate and ex  --  travagant desires . There is all that folly to pay for , and the goddess of folly is one creditor who can not be cheated . We hate to believe this for two reasons . One is that it makes us all to blame ; the other is that if it is true , then certainly there is no easy way out . The power of contagion in the dragon myth indicates the extreme wishful  --  ness of our thinking . The mentality of finance in Wall Street was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . Indeed , the first thought of all , which was to blast the monster by incantation and propa  --  ganda , was a thought that emanated from the imagination of finance and business . The incantation was to say that nothing really had happened , or nothing very serious ; simply , a stock  --  market speculation had collapsed . Everything else was the same as be  --  fore . This was like the primitive people saying of the dragon , as they often did , " He is not . there , " supposing that by denying his existence they put him under a Spa .. And the propaganda that went with the incantation was for everyone to exhort everyone else to behave as if nothing had happened , to produce and consume , to buy and to spend , all as before . A few weeks after the first great stock-market crash in the autumn of 1929 the eminent minds of business , industry and finance con  --  ferred in Washington and resolved to try that magic . Argument in favor of it was not wanting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ? Had we not the means and the materials to produce as much as before for the eat  --  isfaction of those wants ? All that we had to do was to maintain prices and maintain wages , maintaining thereby both the integrity of capital and a high standard of living  --  and resume full speed . The dragon  --  he was not there . Moreover , the ease could be proved statistically . For six years a statistical line representing the average price of the goods and commodities that people were consuming had been horizontal . What did that mean ? It meant there had been no inflation in the average price of things people really wanted to enjoy and consume . The only inflation had been the delirious inflation of se  --  curities , mere pieces of paper that no  --  body could eat or wear . For once it happened  --  for the first time , in fact  --  that you had had a wild speculation in securities and no parallel speculative inflation of prices for goods and com  --  modities . Such was the case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high standard of living  --  holding everything , and going right on . It sounded so ready and simple ; and it had the same specious plausibility that appeared in Upton Sinclair 's EPIC four years later . It had , also , the sad defect of not working . But why should n't it work ? If we have the equipment , the raw materials and the labor  --  all of these in surplus  --  why not start all the factories , put everybody to work , produce ad libitum , and be happy ? Well , there are many reasons why not , and one of them  --  the only one that needs to be mentioned at this point  --  is that at the same time we are trying to hold everything . Burned.Up Buying Power For example , that horizontal statis  --  tical line to represent the average price of goods and commodities  --  the line that was to be held  --  was an illusion in itself . True , it had not been rising ; yet it did not follow as a fact that goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of level prices for goods and commodities the cost of producing them had been enormously reduced by innovations of power , tech  --  nique and method . The price line had been standing still ; the cost line bad been falling . The spread between that level price line and the falling cost line represented the profits Wall Street had capitalized by way of creating the largest and most dazzling bubble in the history of Stock Exchange speculation . Long before this bubble burst , busi  --  ness had fairly used up the buying power of its customers . Every pro  --  ducer had been touching what he called points of saturation . It was each day more difficult to increase the sale of goods  --  at those prices . Hence the re  --  course to installment selling . Business itself began to lend its customers the ( Continued on Page 41 ) ( Continued from Page 3S ) credit to buy with . And all this was so because business had forgotten to share with its customers the benefit of falling costs  --  that is to say , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling costs with the consumer would have been to reduce prices  --  to break that horizontal price lino . This would have had the effect of increasing de  --  mand and releasing the forces of pro  --  duction , As it was , production was limited . By what was it limited ? By the price . By the fancied necessity to maintain a condition of price stability . The trouble then was not overproduction , as has ever since been alleged . It was underproduction . No one need be an economist to see what is wrong there . It is to limit production for the sake of the price . Business was doing it before the depression and boasting of having achieved for the first time a state of price stability . Business will always do it  --  when it can . That is why it has the incorrigible impulse to monopoly and why it was deemed necessary in this country to have antitrust laws and why business thought up so many in  --  genious ways to circumvent them , as by holding companies , and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a sin of the copy books : " A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . " Take care of today and tomorrow will take care of itself . " Lenin said capi  --  talism at any time was willing to cut the throat of its own future in order to gain a present profit . He should have said capital , not capitalism . Capital in this aspect is itself the worst enemy of capitalism . To limit production for the sake of the price , to suppress competi  --  tion , to intend monopoly for great profit alone  --  these are attitudes that belong to the unintelligence of capital ; they are contrary to the life principle of capitalism . In the end , both the capital and the profit will he lost , be  --  cause the power of production and the competitive spirit , so long as they are free and let alone , will presently break down any artificial price line , any monopoly , any limitation proposed to be laid upon the creation of material wealth . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new capital and new profit will appear . Old and New Obsessions So much in one place for the indict  --  ment of business . It is , in the main , true and has the very unusual distinc  --  tion to be both true and popular . Yet consider how the same indictment may lie against the prosecution . The Old Dealers with their horizontal price line to defend and the New Dealers talking of a planned economy , balanced pro  --  duction and price stability are thinking in essentially the same terms . They differ as to whether the motive shall be one of private profit or one of public policy , as if that could matter , pro  --  vided the thing itself is economically unsound  --  and otherwise not at all . The fatal price obsession that had con  --  trolled the mentality of business be  --  came the first principle of NRA . When the New Deal arrived , prices had greatly fallen , and a great mass of fictitious , inflated and imaginary cap  --  ital , founded on the rainbow , had been or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been . No tangible thing had been destroyed ; it was only that everything had been revalued . That was deflation , The idea first to be embraced by the New Deal was one for which a wordhad been invented . The word was " re-nation . " Not reinflation , which would mean to inflate again , but reflation , which means not the bite of the same dog but the dog of the same bite . The undertaking , very explicitly set forth , was to slay the dragon by raising prices to the predepression level  --  the average price of goods and commodities and the price of labor to that level , and the price of agricultural products to a still higher level , on grounds of social jus  --  tice ; and whereas it had been the thought of business in the beginning to defeat the dragon by defending prices on the pre-depression level , in which it failed , it was then for the New Deal to boast that it would slay him by putting prices back to that level . Restoring prices would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great mass of that fictitious , inflated and imaginary capital , founded on the , rainbow , that was about to he wiped out . That fact was let pass as a minor inconsistency . The New Dealers themselves never stressed it , and , besides , this was the sweetness that reconciled business and finance to much else that was sour to their taste . Two Deals With One Problem The formula for raising prices was to cheapen the money in which prices are stated . Thus , if the value of the dollar were halved , so that there might be two dollars wherever there had been one before , then everything that had been priced at one dollar before would be priced at two . Prices would auto  --  matically double . That was the plan . And Congress accordingly gave the President . the power to reduce the value of the dollar one-half . But no sooner had this wonderful ef  --  fect been provided for than everybody began to see the danger that such a rise in prices was likely to bring a flood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pened , would cause prices to fall again . That apparently was a problem no  --  body had thought of . It had to be met . And it was met by setting up the NRA and the AAA to limit production and restrain competition . Analyzing more than 500 NRA codes , a committee of the American Society of Engineers found that in 109 of them were 163 provisions to limit the use and extensionof industrial-plant capacity , in one of the very important ones a direct prohibition of plant ex  --  tension , in twenty-one of them a pro  --  vision that any increase of capacity must first be authorized by the con  --  trolling code authority , in 102 of them provisions to limit output , and in sixty of them provisions to limit the operat  --  ing time of equipment . The Planning and Research Division of the NRA , in a report made last December , found that fifty-ono codes prohibited destruc  --  tive price cutting , ninety-six provided for minimum price fixing in any emer  --  gency , twelve gave the code authority power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below cost . The AAA went in first for paying farmers not to produce , then for de  --  stroying pigs , cattle , grain and cotton , and at last for compulsory limitation of agricultural production . Thus the New Deal found itself in exactly the position of the Old Deal  --  limiting production for the sake of the price . The premises , it is true , had been purified by the substitution of a motive of public policy for one of private profit , but the premises were the same , the thinking was the same and the similar  --  ity is complete . A windlass to lift water out of a well represents one of the primary mechanical powers . Whether the water is blessed or not makes no difference to the windlass ; it must work as a windlass according to a law of its own . Likewise , if limiting pro  --  duction for the sake of the price hinders the creation of material wealth , tending to cause underconsumption and unem  --  employment , it will work that way no matter what the motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Deal was defending a rigid price struc  --  ture , anyone who dared was free to break it , whereas under the New Deal prices are defended by law  --  the price of goods and commodities , the price of service , the price of labor and the price of agricultural products  --  and who breaks the law commits an economic crime , punishable by fine and imprisonment . There were many effects . Some were intended and some were not . In no ease was there the entire and satisfac  --  tory effect that had been commanded to appear . For every disappointment there was blame to be assessed . The Brain Trust blamed the cannibalistic philosophy of business , the RFC blamed the banks , the NRA blamed industry , and industry blamed the Government , all with common consent averting their gaze from the cause of frustration . What is a Price ? The mentality of business mobilized itself at White Sulphur Springs in De  --  cember and issued a testament , saying : " There is ample work to be done to require the employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the capital that may be available . " We know that is true . Then what is the obstruction ? Price is the obstruction . At every point , wherever you look , there some  --  body is defending a price . The Govern  --  ment is defending the price structure as a whole , on grounds of public policy , intending to put it higher . There is a price below which industry can not afford to produce and sell goods , else it will lose its immediate profit ; hence the idleness of much industrial capacity . There is a price below which agricul  --  ture can not afford to produce and sell food and raw commodities like cotton , else it will lose immediately its arti  --  ficially restored parity ; hence the idle  --  ness of much land . There is a price below which labor can not afford to sell its labor , a price below which it is legally forbidden for anybody to buy labor , for fear of what might immediately happen to the stand  --  ard of living ; hence unemployment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to appear and the NRA suggested to itself the idea of somewhat relaxing control of prices by code  --  but this for industry only . At the same time , business , in the testa  --  ment just referred to , was saying that if control of prices and production were permitted to lapse suddenly , with the expiration of the NRA Law in Juno , 1935 , industry would be injured ; and for that reason it proposed that the old NRA should be succeeded by a new NRA , and the new NRA , like the old one , should " contain suitable provi  --  sions concerning maximum hours and minimum wages , " and permit members of industry to enter into agreements with themselves to " facilitate the elim  --  ination of unsound and unfair methods of competition , " to " reduce or prevent price demoralization , " and to " secure reasonable adjustment of capacity to available demand . " Simply , to re  --  strain competition and control produc  --  tion for the sake of the price  --  all , of course , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the New Dealers embrace in one way of thinking . The difference between them is not one of principle . They dis  --  agree only as to who shall determine what degrees of restraint and control are reasonable  --  whether it shall be the Government with industry assenting or industry with the Government 's sanction ; the Government 's part in the latter case being , first , to approve of the agreements en tered into by the members of industry among themselves and then to enforce them " against all parties , " meaning , obviously , against minorities and recalcitrants . The thought rising with NRA at the end of the year that so far as industry was concerned control of prices might be somewhat relaxed was without prejudice to the price obsession . Its position was that minimum wage rates represented a high floor through which prices could not fall . That is certainly true , because wages are the largest single element of cost . But in that case you are defending two things at once  --  namely , the price of labor on one line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , and the cost of production thus defended is the floor through which prices are not likely to fall . All that can happen is that production will cease at that line  --  and prices will hold . The joker is that if you make the cost line rigid by fixing a minimum wage and at the same time restore competi  --  tion in prices , then prices , under the force of competition , will tend to sink to the cost line and profit will be squeezed out . The problem will be again what it was , only very much worse . This price obsession is one of the deep and curious similarities . Every  --  one shall be saved by the price  --  else everyone will be lost by the price . What is a price ? What is the ultimate mean  --  ing of price  --  any price at all ? In an obvious way , it is what you must pay in every ease to satisfy a want . In a slightly less obvious way , it is a rela  --  tion between any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further meaning . The existence of a price means that there is yet an unsatisfied want for the thing the price represents . This is true , no matter what the price is , no matter what the thing is , only so long as there is a price . In this sense , the price of a loaf of bread in a free economic system and a bread card in a controlled economic system would have the same meaning . In the free eco  --  nomic system it is the price that rations the supply ; in the other it is the bread card . And what is true of bread will be true of everything else . The Phantom of Overproduction The only limit to demand we have ever touched  --  the only limit we can imagine  --  is all of a thing that can be sold at a certain pries . Reduce the price , and the demand , as we say , in  --  creases . It does not increase really ; only more of it becomes more effective . So much for overproduction . There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only some  --  times more than could be sold at cer  --  tain prices . It is easy to see how this is true as concerning industry , wherein only cap  --  ital and profit are involved . It is heresy to see and very unpopular to say that the same is true of labor . It is easy to see that raising prices tends to limit the demand for goods and com  --  modities ; it is again heresy to see and unpopular to say that raising wages ( Cantina ed on Pas . 44 ) If what happened in a recent scientific " role L. study happens in this family , there should be 50% fewer people catching this woman 's cold if they use Pepsodent Antiseptic regularly . We use this means of illustrating in a dra  --  matic way how Pepsodent can help you pre  --  vent colds this winter . The test we refer to included 500 people over a period of five months . These 500 peo  --  ple were divided into several groups . Some gargled with plain salt and water  --  others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively . Here a what happened as shown by official scientific records . The group who used Pepsodent Antiseptic had 50% fewer colds than those who used other leading mouth antiseptics or those who used plain salt and water . The group who used Pepsodent Antiseptic , and did catch cold , were able to rid them  --  selves of their colds in half the time of those who used other methods . And so , while we can not scientifically pre  --  dict how many people would catch cold in this family , nor just how many would have a cold if they did n't use Pepsodent Antisep  --  tic , we do say that what happened in this sci  --  entific test on 500 people can be applied to some extent to any other group . Pepsodent can be diluted Remember , Pepsodent Antiseptic is three times as powerful in killing germs as other leading mouth antiseptics . You can mix Pepsodent Antiseptic with two parts of water and it still kills germs in less than ten seconds . Therefore , Pepsodent gives you three times as much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still gives you the protection of a safe , effi  --  cient antiseptic . Get Pepsodent Antiseptic and see for your  --  self just how effective it is in helping you prevent colds this winter . ( Continued frees Page 42 ) likewise limits the demand for labor . In one ease we are defending a capital structure , and the result is idleness of plant . In the other ease we are defend  --  ing a standard of living , and the result is idleness of labor . It follows , not as a paradox , that the price we pay for trying to defend a high standard of living is unemployment . Only a rich country can afford unem  --  employment as a social and political problem . The richer the country and the higher the standard of living it is trying to defend , the more acute that problem may be . In a poor country where the conditions are so hard that people must work for any wage they can get. , you never hear of unemploy  --  ment as a problem . We are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living to defend , and our unemployment problem , accordingly , is the one of first magnitude . Feeling at this point becomes very tense . What if ours is the highest stand  --  ard of living in the world ? Is it high enough ? What if our standard of un  --  employment relief is the highest in the world ? Is it as high as it ought to be ? Shall the old sequence be repeated ? Shall it be taken out of labor first ? Shall the standard of living be sacri  --  ficed before profit in order that pros  --  perity may rise ? Here are various common assump  --  tions . One is that the feeling of what ought to be is in itself a miraculous power , and that if only we will concede that people are entitled to a much higher standard of living , that every man is entitled to such a wage as that standard requires and that every man is entitled to a job at that wage , there  --  fore , simply it shall be and is so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality is a proposal to sacrifice the standard of living . The old sequence in every depression was first a fall of prices , then a collapse of profits , then a reduction of money wages , and presently a terrific increase of production . A reduction in money wages is not the same as a fall in the buying power of wages . The buying power of wages is relative , determined by the cost of things . A Phenomenon of a System The standard of living has had some minor setbacks , but never in this coun  --  try was it ever sacrificed , never did anyone propose that it should be . On the contrary , during seventy-five years-1840 to 1914 ? notwithstanding three great depressions , the buying power of American wages increased threefold . For its implications in terms of human well-being there is probably no fact comparable to this one in the economic history of the human race ; and it occurred in a free competitive system . There is no reason to suppose it would not be repeated in a free com  --  petitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under that system , so long as production increases . If pro  --  duction is increased  --  simply that and nothing else  --  the buying power of wages is bound to rise . Either prices will be reduced or money wages will rise , and the effect is in either case the same . This must happen by a law of necessity . There is no other way to dispose of the product . The opposite is that you can not by any means increase the buying power of people without first increasing the quantity of things to be bought . There is a doctrine that says you can , or one that said you could . The application of that doctrine caused the price of labor to rise more than anything else . Last December the National Bureau of Economic Research produced a series of index numbers " defining changes in the various elements of the price struc  --  ture , " October , 1934 , compared with July , 1929 . If , in October , 1934 , the average of wholesale prices was 79 per cent of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , 82 per cent , and the prices received by farmers , 68 per cent , then the hourly wage rate for industrial labor in October , 1934 , was 102 per cent of what it had been in July , 1929 . Thus , the price of industrial labor had risen more than anything else . This can not have increased the demand for labor ; it can only have made it less than it might have been . And what does it mean to an unemployed man to tell him that if he had a job the buying power of his hourly wage would be 102 per cent ? With so much in common among the various antagonistic ways of our think  --  ing , there must be something more . And there is . The chord of this arc of thought is a common delusion . It would be possible to write the story of mankind as a history of great popular delusions . The one in which now we are involved is probably the incomparable instance of the mind deceiving itself . It is a delusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on it . So now are all the new economic worlds that are proposed to be created . Let the Next Generation Pay For a long time the world has been trying to do something with credit that credit will not do  --  substituting it for capital , for substance , for reality . We begin dimly to see the folly of war on credit . We do not see that war debts and depression debts possess the same character . All the things needful to conduct a war exist at the time . So why the fiction of borrowing them from the future ? Why create a debt to represent them ? In the same way , all the things needful to feed and clothe and house the unemployed exist in the present .. Why a fiction of borrowing them from the future ? Why create a debt to represent them ? The reason in both cases is the wish to postpone and avoid payment . Let others pay . Let tomorrow pay . Let the next generation pay . A war that was charged wholly to its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion , would be a very unpopular war . But it would be a solvent war . So also with depression . Every depression hitherto has been paid for at the time . Such a thing as issuing bonds for relief was almost unknown . And that is why the recovery , when it came , was al  --  ways so amazing . It had no load of debt to drag along ; ahead of it a new , unmortgaged future . Now for the first time we are trying to charge a depres  --  sion to the future , though never before had we been so rich in all the means to pay for it ourselves . Standing now in the passive sign , finance is aghast at what the Govern  --  ment does with credit ; it sees very clearly that the Government ought to balance its budget . It forgets who un  --  balanced the budget of the whole private world . Finance did that . It forgets that its own New Era was founded on a phantasy of unlimited credit , and that the name " New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying there was no small thing . Finance now sees the danger of subati  --  tuting public debt for private debt in the popular instance . It forgets that when ( Coatinued on Pose 48 ) ( Continued ' rem Page 44 ) the New Era smashed , it invoiced public credit to save its own private capital structures . As a practical matter , it may be that a railroad unable to pay its debts or a bank unable to keep itself solvent is a better risk at the public treasury , as a borrower of public credit , than millions of distressed farmers in  --  dividually or hundreds of thousands of little home owners unable to pay their interest and taxes ; but that is not an opinion you may assert , and , besides , it . does not make political sense . Once the public treasury has been opened to distressed private railroads and dis  --  tressed private banks on ground of public policy , who in distress there  --  after shall be denied ? The difference between the New Era and the New Deal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The difference , again , is one of motive . If the New Era was governed by a credit delusion , so is the New Deal . What happened in the New Era bubble was that hallucinated finance stuffed the banks with bonds and took away the substance of people 's deposits ; the sub  --  stance was spent and much of it was lost . Thus , a town in Germany might be building a playhouse or the Cubans might be decorating a boulevard in Havana with the savings of an inno  --  cent bank depositor in Boston , Cleve  --  land , Des Moines or Amarillo . For purposes of the New Deal , the Gov  --  ernment presses its bonds into the banks and takes away the substance of the deposits . If that substance is lost , it will be lost , and all the Government can over do about it will be to print the money to buy back its bonds and so re  --  place the deposits . The New Deal has that advantage . It can print money . But what the depositor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Era had been able to print money to replace the bank deposits that were lost , the ecstasy might have lasted somewhat longer ; the disaster would have been all the worse when it came . Suppose now the question that was left in suspense be asked again . What is it we are discussing ? Certainly not recovery as an economic problem , not that primarily . We do want recovery , but we want it on terms , and with guaranties beforehand as to how the benefits shall he divided . A World of Balanced Abundance In his first message to the new Con  --  gress in January the President said : " The attempt to make a distinction between recovery and reform is a nar  --  rowly conceived effort to substitute the appearance of reality for reality itself . When a man is convalescing from ill  --  ness , wisdom dictates not only cure of the symptoms but also removal of their cause . " We are discussing , therefore , not only a fortunate way out of depression but a way that shall bring us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we shall never be ill again  --  a world of stability that shall , neverthe  --  less , progress ; a world in which every  --  one shall possess security with still some adventure in it , a world of bal  --  anced abundance , a world in which the profit motive shall he tamed and social  --  ised and produce only the good ef'f'ect , a world in which competition shall be polite and never destructive , yet at the same time creative . Not a perfect world , perhaps . Only one that , shall have been greatly perfected . The kind of world it ought to be  --  now . That might turn out to be a stationary world . However , it is impossible not tobe sympathetic . The alternative is one we do not wish to embrace . It is what we have been trying to think ourselves out of . There is a grim way out . We have known that all the time . The one word to recomrnend it is " certainty . " Every  --  thing else about it is forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Brain Trust , A. A. Berle , Jr. , writing on The Social Economics of the New Deal , said : " The old economic forces still work , and they do produce a bal  --  ance after a while . But they take so long to do it and they crush so many men in the process that the strain on the social system becomes intolerable . Leaving economic forces to work them  --  selves out as they now stand will pro  --  duce an economic balance , but in the course of it you may have half of the entire population begging in the streets or starving to death . " The Grim Way Oue The spectacle of half the population begging or starving may be disre  --  garded . In the first place , it is im  --  agined , with the fearful imagination of the Brain Trust that does always re  --  member to leave some saving qualifies , - tion , as in this case the word " may " ; in the second place , the only reason why millions of people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal is that the country is rich enough to sustain its unemployed , and thanks for this not to the New Deal , that has added nothing to the sum of wealth , but to the free economic sys  --  tem that made it the richest country in the world ; and , in the third place , until that wealth is gone there will be no starving in the streets , no matter which way we go . That the grim way would work is not disputed . But the immediate cost is more than we want to pay . First , we should have to stop issuing Government bonds for any purpose , cast out the secret vial of nepenthe called inflation , and take our private hands out of the public treasury while it is yet solvent  --  and this on the ground , if no other , that an empty treasury is of no use whatever . But , this would mean paying for the depres  --  sion out of our own means instead of charging it to the future . It would mean an immediate increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondly , we should have to remove all the restraints that have been laid upon production and competition . Thirdly , we should have to let all prices go , including the price of labor . Prices probably would not go very far . Goods and commodities , if they should fall at all , would probably fall more than money wages , as they have always clone before ; in which case the buying power of wages would tend to rise . If the natural forces of recovery are acting , the total cost of recovery by this hard way would turn out to be much less than we might expect . On the other hand , if the natural forces of recovery are not acting , which of all the darling schemes proposed will not fail ? Yet suppose the sternness of life had been but the appearance of reality . Suppose the inequalities , the frustra  --  tions , the cruelties , the struggle , had been all unreal , from wrong ways of social and political thinking , and that reality itself were " the substance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In that case , of course , we should be very stupid to think of tak  --  ing the hard economic way again .
