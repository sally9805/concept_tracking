These things are no secrets in Pennsylvania : 1 ) that John L. Lewis wants his friend and fellow Mine Worker , Lieutenant Governor Thomas Kennedy , elected Governor this year ; 2 ) that Pennsylvania 's Democratic boss , Senator Joseph F. Guffey does not want him at the head of the ticket because Mr. Kennedy is a better labor man than Democrat ; 3 ) that Pennsylvania 's present Governor , George Howard Earle , can hardly afford to alienate either Joseph Guffey or the strongest labor leader in U. S. history if he expects to be elected Senator this year and President in 1940 . Last week these three open secrets exploded at a piping hot mush breakfast in the dining room of the Governor 's mansion in Harrisburg . <P> The breakfast , at which Governor Earle was entertaining State Democratic Chair man David Lawrence and Philadelphia Leader Matt McCloskey , had been called to celebrate the Guffey machine 's decision of the night before on its candidate for Governor in the April primaries . No sooner had Mr. Guffey 's followers started congratulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer named Charles Alvin Jones on his tentative nomination than the excitement be gan . No reporters were present and most of them were unable to describe the scene in detail , but Thomas P. O'Neil of Phila delphia 's rabid ( pro-Roosevelt &; proLabor ) Record , wrote a graphic , if second hand account : <P> " Guffey arrived . . . fighting mad . . . . ' All bets are off , ' said Guffey . ' I am a candidate for Governor , come hell or high water . . . . ' Matt McCloskey raced across the room , shook his fist under Guffey 's nose . . . . Red with rage , Dave Lawrence , who the night before took himself out of the race , jumped into the free-for-all . . . . ' Now I understand , ' he bellowed , ' why I did n't get the support for my candidacy from persons who . . . should have been in my corner ! ' " <P> One report maintained that in the course of the excitement " a cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor . " All spectators agreed that Senator Guffey stalked out of the room . When he reappeared after taking a walk along the Susquehanna , he announced that he had reconsidered and would give " wholehearted support " to the ticket after all . But later that day Miner Lewis flatly announced in Washington that , ticket or no ticket , he would support Miner Kennedy for Governor . Did this mean , newshawks asked , that C. I. O. 's half-million Pennsylvania voters would walk out on the Democratic ticket ? Replied John L. Lewis : " Figure it out for yourself . " <P> Since Mr. Lewis holds the balance of power in Pennsylvania , the ticket was temporarily shelved . Adding to the confusion is the fact that John L. Lewis is toying with the idea of backing Republican Gifford Pinchot for Governor , running Miner Kennedy for Senator .
