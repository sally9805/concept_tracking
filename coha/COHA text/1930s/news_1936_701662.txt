txt Talk of dollar devaluation and currency tinkering which Washington as well as the financial district are inclined to regard as the mere pyrotechnics of the new session of Congress . was taken more seriously in foreign capitals yesterday . The result was that foreign currencies rose sharply against the dollar . Overnight cables to Europe told of the Committee for the Nation 's renewed drive for dollar devaluation and the proposal of Senator Thomas . leported in Thursday 's Wall Street Journal , to pay off the bonus with gold and silver stocks in the Treasury . London and Paris . already apparently nervous about possible consequences of invalidation of the AAA and the veteran ' bonus drive , were apparently more disturbed than domestic quarters . It was not clear , however , that the nervousness went so far as to cause any considerable withdrawal of capital and investments from this market for informed and competent sources reported that European buying and selling of American stocks about balanced .

However , later in the afternoon , they began to move up again , so that the close showed large gains throughout the list . Local foreign exchange quarters were inclined to attribute the sudden reversal in the market to the telegram sent on Wednesday by the Committee of the Nation , urging the President to forestall a drop in commodity prices by increasing the gold price to $41 per ounce . This was believed to be the basis for new devaluation talk in Europe . However , it is generally taken for granted that the President will shortly issue a proclamation extending- for another year both the 52 , - 000.000,000 stabilization fund and his power to alter the gold content of the dollar to between 50 , - ; and 60 ; - of its former parity . Behavior of various domestic markets that would benefit from devaluation also tended to minimize the European reports .

There v. as appal ently no concerted foreign selling of American securities , for example . Reports from various international houses indicated approximately a balance between buying and selling in the aggregate . This state of balance is said to have prevailed for the last several days . Most of the activity in foreign exchanges is believed to have been covering and adjusting positions . Extensive short positions had been maintained in the European currencies in expectation of early devaluation of the franc . Dollar devaluation rumors , the reduction in the French bank rate to from 5 ' , , talk of a. large French railway loan in London , and the improved French outlook , changed the outlook for the franc and led to extensive short covering in the unit .

In the past year , the dollar has been singularly free from speculative attack . even when inflationary proposals were uttered in the last Congress This had led to more or less confidence in the future of the dollar , or at least to the disappearance of fear of immediate changes Sterling yesterday ranged between a high of $4.95 ' 7/5 and a low of $4.94% and closed at $4.95 , , 5 , up 1 .

PARIS  --  The fall in the dollar from over 15.17 francs to under 15.10 , combined with reduction of the French bank rate to 4% from 5 , ; - , plus substantial rumors of a forthcoming foreign credit for France have changed the immediate French outlook again . The chief explanation available here for the dip of the dollar was the wide reference in the financial press Thursday morning to the possibility of President Roosevelt 's deciding to utilize the 10% devaluation margin for which he still has power in order to meet the problems brought up by the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with a statement by Herriot that the French financial situation is good , and that even the internal and international situation is satisfactory , apparently sufficed to scare those who were short of francs and a. considerable offering of dollars was noted with the opening of the official exchange market in Paris . Sterling weakened also but registered a better performance than did the dollar , falling only from 74.88 francs on Wednesday to 74.74 , but forward premiums on both sterling and dollars were down sharply . The rumors of a foreign credit for France mention the placing of French railway bills in London . This would avoid the necessity of asking the French Parliament to raise the existing limit of 15,000,000.000 francs for Treasury bills . Inasmuch as the railways in France are heavy debtors to the State , the latter would immediately be able to make use of the francs resulting from the operation , the total of which might run to four or five million francs . It is supposed that the Bank of France would be authorized to sell this sterling for forward delivery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising 50 to 80 centimes ; but elsewhere business was light and there was no great weakening of internationals.
