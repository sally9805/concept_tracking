Fhrer Adolf Hitler is no man to take unnecessary risks . If the German Navy were to steam into Danzig Harbor and forcefully take over the Free City , Britain 's Peace Front might well become a War Front . A neater , less dangerous solution would be for the Danzig Senate simply to declare the City annexed to Germany . This would place Poland in the bad strategic position of having to take the initiative and becoming the technical aggressor . If Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain should get fainthearted about the Polish Guarantee , as the Nazis confidently expect , he would have a hole , albeit small , through which he could weasel . The first timid step in this direction was taken last week when a German naval delegation , at the invitation of the Danzig Government , visited the Free City . <P> President of the Danzig Senate is Arthur Greiser , a native of Poznan , who went to Danzig in 1920 because American relief food was plentiful there . A failure at everything else , he went into politics , progressively switching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' party ) , to the Nazis . Oratory and a talent for street-fighting made him Deputy-gauleiter of Danzig and President of the Senate in 1934 , a year after the Nazis had gained control of the Danzig Government . Nazi Greiser prefers autonomy for Danzig to actual annexation by Germany , but when the time comes he wo n't have much to say about it . <P> To match Polish Navy week at neighboring Gdynia , President Greiser , conveniently a lieutenant in the German Navy , invited a naval delegation from East Prussia to dedicate a Danzig monument to German sailors lost in the World War . The delegation , including the Reich 's Rear Admiral Fleischer and a company of marines with a brass band , arrived in Danzig last Sunday . There were speeches and a parade , all surprisingly nonbelligerent . The Poles ignored the move , and sly Danzig Nazis reasoned that if they could get away with one " foreign " naval detachment in the Free City , they might get away with more .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
