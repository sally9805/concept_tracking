When McNaught Syndicate announced that Alfred Emanuel Smith would write a weekly newspaper " feature " ( TIME , Nov. 24 ) many there were who expected to see the Brown Derby perched jauntily at the top of every paragraph . Last week the first Smith article appeared in 70 Saturday and Sunday papers . Although Unemployment was the subject , there was no smack of stump-speeching , certainly no Hoover-heckling. * Indeed , Writer Smith noted that " We have had breadlines in New York City even during our most prosperous times . " He chided the U. S. public for its short-sighted failure to prepare unemployment relief during days of plenty ; upheld the President 's request for the right to allocate relief funds and spanked the Senate for contesting that right . He pleaded for a proper census of unemployed and expressed favor of a five-day week at six-day wages . Writer Smith 's style was calm , warm , readable . Excerpts : <P> " The market crash of October and November 1929 did not by any means start the present unemployment crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was at a later date that the business depression started . . . . <P> " . . . If appropriating agencies continue to make their appropriations under the old , antiquated , worn-out system . . . we will find there is little , if anything , that the Government can do toward immediate relief of unemployment . " The American people never carry an umbrella . They prepare to walk in eternal sunshine . In times of prosperity and plenty , the public . . . orator who would suggest a measure for unemployment relief would find it most difficult to get an audience . . . . There is little doubt in my mind that we may be able to work out some system of deferring portions of public works and holding them in reserve for . . . unemployment . " <P> Mr. Smith prepares his articles in his office at No. 200 Madison Ave . from press clippings and other data compiled by researchers . He dictates his " stuff " rapidly , cigar in mouth , as he paces the floor . Variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 60-40 split of the gross income of the feature , with a present assurance of $1,050 per week on the basis of the present list of customers . But at both McNaught syndicate and Mr. Smith 's office it was stated that no such information had ever been given out . <P> Writing must not take up too much of busy Mr. Smith 's time . Each morning he goes to the nearly-completed Empire State ( world 's tallest ) Building of which he is president &; director ; each afternoon to the County Trust Co. of New York of which he is board chairman . He also serves the League of New York Theatres ( anti-scalper ) as " people 's representative , " and the Emergency Employment Committee . Last fortnight he visited his friend Vincent Astor in New York Hospital , last week danced at Governor Roosevelt 's re-inauguration in Albany ( see cut , p. 20 ) . <P> <P> * In a foreword Writer Smith said : " The articles . . . are . . . the expression of my indi vidual opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever to my leadership of the Democratic Party . ... I will never speak or write , solely for the purpose of political advantage . "
