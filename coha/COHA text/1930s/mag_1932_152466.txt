Eight more States plumped for Franklin Delano Roosevelt last week . They and their national convention votes were : Oregon 10 , Nevada 6 , Tennessee 24 , Vermont 8 , South Carolina 18 , Kansas 20 , New Mexico 6 , Montana 8 . The Roosevelt total of " sure votes " thus rose to 412 . A majority of 578 is required to control the convention 's organization , dictate the party 's platform . Excluding Virginia and Texas which have " favorite sons , " eight states are yet to pick and pledge their delegations . These States have only 124 convention votes . <P> To Alfred Emanuel Smith last week went Connecticut with 16 votes and New Jersey with 32 . Total Smith vote : 100 . At Warm Springs , Ga . Candidate Roosevelt last week not only re-introduced the " forgotten man " as a campaign issue but also brought forth a new figure- " the forgotten child . " To Kiwanians he quoted Thomas Jefferson 's last letter : " The mass of mankind was not born with saddles on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurred , ready to ride mankind . " Declared the New York Governor : " I think that statement is just as true today as it was in 1826 . The mass of mankind was not born with saddles on their backs , but many of them do have saddles on their backs nevertheless . And their saddles can be removed by the right kind of attitude on government . . . Clearly it is a duty of government in an emergency to prevent any man , woman or child from starving . ... I believe someone has spoken of the forgotten man . But there is also the forgotten child . One of the great advances of current life is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a physically handicapped , forgotten child who requires help . " <P> At Atlanta later in the week Candidate Roosevelt delivered another campaign speech . Addressing Oglethorpe University 's commencement crowd , he declared : " I believe we are on the threshold of a fundamental change in our popular economic thought , that in the future we are going to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do what we may have to do to inject life into our ailing economic order , we can not make it endure for long unless we can bring about a wiser , more equitable distribution of the national income . . . . The country demands bold persistent experimentation . It is common sense to take a method and try it . If it fails , admit it and try another . But above all , try something . The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach . " <P> In Governor Roosevelt 's absence , Governor William Henry ( " Alfalfa Bill " ) Murray , Oklahoma 's roving " favorite son , " entered New York last week , * had the following to say : " I 'm not kidding myself that I could ever be elected President . No party would want to nominate me . I have n't got any money and you ca n't get the Democratic or Republican nomination without money . I never give up a fight but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Who 'll get the nomination ? It 's going to be an open fight with everyone having a chance but me. . . . '
