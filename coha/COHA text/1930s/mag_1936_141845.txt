AMERICAN AGENT-Melvin H. Purvis-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.75 ) . <P> Inhibited by the need for keeping professional secrets from criminals , officers of the law usually write books that have all the bad features of detective stories and none of their ingenuity . By no means so pompous in his professional recollections as Sir Basil Thomson , onetime chief of Scotland Yard ( The Story of Scotland Yard ) , Melvin Horace Purvis , onetime head of the Chicago office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , nevertheless falls into the literary ambush that has trapped so many of his predecessors , composing an account that contains two parts of philosophizing on crime to every one part of concrete information , two descriptions of plodding toil for every one of exciting capture or escape . The result is an uneven book narrowly saved from tediousness by Author Purvis ' occasional candor . <P> It begins promisingly with a forthright description of the major fiasco in the pursuit by Federal agents of John Dillinger-the shooting at Little Bohemia , near Rhinelander , Wis. on April 22 , 1934 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding-place and in the subsequent confusion shot three innocent men and lost one agent to the escaping gunmen . Recounting the last-minute tip that made haste necessary and bad organization inevitable , Author Purvis tells of the flight of three airplanes loaded with special agents from Chicago , of the drive to Little Bohemia in ramshackle cars , of sneaking through the woods at night , of his attempted resignation when the full proportions of the catastrophe became clear . Thereafter he adopts an impersonal tone , discourses on the duties of Federal agents , gives an unilluminating sketch of his own background , discusses the habits of gangsters and the weakness of law enforcement , retells the stories of the Factor , Bremer , Urschel and Robinson kidnappings , the deaths of Pretty Boy Floyd , Baby Face Nelson , John Dillinger . Best parts of American Agent are its thumbnail biographies of public enemies : Verne Miller , migratory worker , parachute jumper , sergeant in the U. S. Army , who became a sheriff before he became a gangster , then posed as a wealthy oilman and joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Illinois football star , Army flyer , crack golfer and gentle , well-mannered assassin . <P> The Author , Born in Timmonsville , S.
