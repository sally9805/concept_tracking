BUSINESS &; FINANCE <P> By last week it was apparent to even the most confirmed optimist that the U. S. is in the midst of a business depression quite severe enough to explain the 40% drop of the New York stock market in the past three months . But in Wall Street there is still much talk that the market 's fall is due primarily to such " technical reasons " as lack of liquidity brought on by too much Government regulation . Regarded , therefore , as something of a seer is the Stock Exchange 's President Charles R. Gay , who sounded off against Government regulation in his annual report just as the break in prices was beginning ( TIME , Aug. 30 ) . From Washington last week the seer got his long expected and long delayed official spanking . <P> When President Gay made his original assault on SEC trading strictures , the Commission 's chairman was James M. Landis . An amiable watchdog , he made only a partial retort , resigned to become dean of Harvard Law School ( TIME , Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEC came in for considerable criticism from New Dealers . So when the SEC fell to Chairman William Orville Douglas , he began negotiating with the Stock Exchange for a letter to be written by President Gay explaining that the Exchange had no knife sharpened for the SEC and reviewing the Exchange 's own plans to keep its house in order . No less than 15 versions of the letter were composed by the Exchange 's law committee , sent to Washington and promptly sent back as unsatisfactory . Last week , suddenly losing patience , Bill Douglas issued a manifesto which not only answered President Gay but also confirmed Wall Street 's fear that the onetime law professor is a reformer of unswervable purpose . Excerpts : <P> " I have always regarded the exchanges as the scales upon which that great national resource , invested capital , is weighed and evalued . Scales of such importance must be tamper-proof with no concealed springs-and there must be no laying on of hands . Such scales must not be utilized by the inside few to the detriment of the outside many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations , exchanges have always administered their affairs in much the same manner as private clubs . For a business so vested with public interest , this traditional method has become archaic . . . . <P> " A vigilant , vigorous , and full-time enforcement of existing regulatory obligations is essential . But even more important is a progressive assault upon the roots of practices which make many of these rules necessary . That assault can be a joint venture of the commission and the exchanges-and it is my hope that it will be exactly that . <P> " The problem of the permissible field of operation of the professional trading member on the floor of the Exchange for his own account is one which has long pressed for solution . . . . Any study of our markets over the past twenty-five years will reveal that there has always been present a tendency upon the part of the professional trader to accentuate a declining market by selling short for speculative profit at a time when public distress adds a factor of demoralization. . . .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
