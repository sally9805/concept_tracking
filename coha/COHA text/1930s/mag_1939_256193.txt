Meraud Guinness ( pronounced Merode Ginnis ) was the eldest beautiful daughter of the beautiful Mrs. Benjamin Guinness of New York and London . At the celebrated ball given by the Guinnesses for their servants in 1926 at their town house in London , Meraud and her sister , Tanis , entertained with songs &; sketches . They and their innumerable cousins of the rich and fecund Guinness family ( brewing ) were chief among the Bright Young People whom Evelyn Waugh parodied in Vile Bodies . One of their inventions was the Treasure Hunt-a fad which began by perturbing nocturnal London , traveled to the high schools of the Far West , became the Scavenger Hunt and returned to Paris via the cinema ( TIME , March 27 ) . <P> Meraud , named doubtless by exotic derivation from meraude ( emerald ) , took after her mother in an eccentric love of painting .

" One day she ran off to France with Seor Alvaro Guevara , a charming Chilean painter whose portrait of Poetess Edith Sitwell hangs in the Tate Gallery . Tentative little paintings by Meraud Guevara began to . appear in the Paris Salon des Independants . That was ten years ago . <P> Last week Meraud Guevara had her first exhibition on Manhattan 's 57th Street and the critics went down like ninepins . Her 26 paintings at the Valentine Gallery , all done in the last two years , showed a quality which is rare in art and which sometimes starts more enduring fashions than Treasure Hunts : the intelligent mastery and transforming use of a great past style . In this case it was the so-called " archaic " coolness and clarity of form of 16th-century French painting , after the great portraitist , Franois Clouet . The line in Artist Guevara 's pictures seems almost engraved ; her forms are firmly rounded , spick- &-span,; in cool , grey-blue space .
