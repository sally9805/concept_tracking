For those who were surprised that , in view of the Philippines ' recent acute agrarian troubles , no more was earmarked for this purpose , President Quezon had a ready answer : if he promised to buy estates wherever agrarian trouble started , landowners who were eager to sell out would foment trouble to encourage sales .
