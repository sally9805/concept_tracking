txt THE WHITESTONE BRANCH . Residents of Affected Area Seek Reasons for Lack of Action . I/16 Amor or The New York Times : The matter . of the acquisition of the Whitestone Landing branch of the Long Island Railroad by the city has got me puzzled . As I understand it , the Long Island has offered to deed to the city the roadbed , rails and equipment , together with many acres of valuable land abutting the tracks and stations , all ' for $1 . The f city has refused to accept this gift : Thirty thousand residents of , the affected ' communities would like to know why . ? Many property ' owners and taxpayers , of whom I am one , would like to know why . I have attended two hearings and have read every statement issued by the Board of Transportation , and the most I have been able to get is this : " The road is not available for rapid transit . " What does that mean ? They do not state that it Is not suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is quite suitable and can be converted for such use at a great saving to the city as compared with the cost of building any other line of transit for this section . To me , es well as to all the residents and taxpayers who are interested in this matter , the statement means only that the Board of Transportation has refused to divulge its actual reason for this action in this matter . A year ago a duly accredited committee representing all the welfare organization of Whitestone , College Point , Malba and Beechhurst appeared before the Mayor and Board of Aldermen and pointed outs to them the plight which the residents of these sections would be in if the city did not take some definite action at once . They showed that , because of this situation , values were depreciating , mortgages were being foreclosed and many small home owners were threatened with the loss of their homes and- their life savings . But the city took no action and still has no definite plan . If the Board of Transportation is determined to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island lines can be converted at much lower cost , the least they can do is to build at once and persuade the Long Island to continue its service until a new road is finished . So far as I know , they have no plans for the near future except an intention to appeal from the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission . Such action merely leaves things up in the air for a longer period . Furthermore , rumors are about that with the affirmation of the terstate Commerce Commission 's permission to abandon the road the Long Island will withdraw its offer to present it to the city for $1 . Last week a committee of 150 residents of the affected areas appeared before the Board of Aldermen to request some definite action . I am sure that most of them were , put through a great hardship to get away from their business and occupations , and yet , the . hearing was postponed . Must they come again this week and again the following week ? Can the interest of such a great number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easily ignored ? BENJAMIN KURTMAN . New York , Nov . Z2 , 193 ( 1 . JUSTICE IS HANDICAPPED . Frequently Hobbled as Well as Blindfolded in City Courts . To the Editor of The New York Times : I submit a letter which I have just received from one of the newer judges of our Municipal Court in ac ? knowledgment of one written him by me in which I commended : the very splendid and conscientious work which this particular judge has been doing since his election less than two years ago . It is a most significant document ; and I feel sure that , not giving his name , he will not resent my sharing the letter with my fellow-readers of THE TIMES . I quote from it as follows : " Real justice under the present system is almost impossible . An unscientific calendar practice ; repeated interruptions of judicial labors caused by chasing justices , from one district to another ( a plan based on lack of confidence in the court ) and prohibiting continuity of effort ; no conveniently available law library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' our immediate stiperiors , to find the precedent we are supposed to follow , and few , Of any , physical accommodations ; are but some of our handicaps . " But what is more important is the lack of any real incentive to the most painstaking , impartial , judicial administration of justice ; something that will make an elevation to this bench a career , and not a campaign . " This last month in my home district has witnessed a heavy calendar e'Very day , , an endless stream of litigation where ' the justice is both ' court and counsel , and where one 's actsemay be writing a lasting impression of ' justice " on the ignorant mind of some impoverished layman . To be deliberate and right under su conditions is a strong challenge the best mind . I love the work at all times  --  I loathe the atmosphere sometimes . " BENNO LEWINSON .
