// A TE in the afternoon of September 10 , 1927 , a small pale-faced French youth hit a tennis ball across a net , sent his racket twirling forty feet straight up in the air with a shout of exultation and ran forward to greet his beaten foe amid the pandemonium of twelve thousand onlookers . The scene was the Germantown Cricket Club , Philadelphia . The occasion was the challenge-round match between France and the United States for the Davis Cup . Henri Cochet had defeated William Johnston in the deciding contest of the series and the modern Four Musketeers had wrested world supremacy on the courts from America . Strong Frenchmen wept with joy . Frenziedly , they rushed down from the stands to bestow the accolade of the kiss upon the boyish cheeks of their conquering heroes and to lift them in triumph to their shoulders . A few days later , thousands of people lined the curbs of Fifth Avenue in New York as the joyous invaders from overseas staged a victory procession . In a glittering cavalcade , they set out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the captain of a French liner , who , in full-dress uniform , received it at the top of his gangplank . The End of a Net Dynasty " O VEREMPHASIS " one might have called it  --  all this tumult and shouting and panoply over the result of a game . But consider the circumstances . For seven years America had ruled supreme in tennis . Through the might that lay in the rackets of William Tilden and Johnston , the United States had stood as the Mecca of the game , toward which the foremost players of the globe had annually bent their steps , to be royally welcomed and soundly ' trounced . The Four Musketeers had taken their lickings along with the rest . Year after year they had challenged at Forest Hills and Germantown , and gone back empty-handed . Tilden and Johnston were names to strike terror to their hearts , invincible monarchs of the court who knew no mercy and whose dynasty , apparently , was endless . Anti now , finally , after so many years of travail and frustration , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitulation . All the bitterness and despair the Musketeers had known in their many disastrous campaigns were engulfed in the hurrahing and rejoicing over France 's first victory in a Davis Cup challenge round , and the names of Cochet , Lacoste , Borotra and Brugnon were the toasts of Paris boulevards . Who could begrudge the French their moment of glory ? Certainly not the Americans , after seven years of absolute sway . Besides , from this geographical slant , it was truly considered to be merely a phenomenon of the moment , a temporary eclipse that would give way before the rising effulgence of America 's destiny on the tennis courts . So isolated had been our position at the top of the tennis heap that the success of the Four Musketeers was fancied to constitute merely a fleeting interregnum . The prestige of American rackets was too overwhelming , the myth of our inherent superiority was too strongly intrenched to permit of the shattering thought that any other nation could take more than passing precedence over us . With our great wealth of young players coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the East , the Middle West and the South , it was inconceivable that we could play second string to any other country . Let France have her moment of triumph . She bad persevered long enough to deserve it ? . But let her have no illusions about starting a new dynasty . Her cycle would run its course in a twelvemonth or two years  --  certainly three years at the most  --  and the Davis Cup would then return to where it properly belonged . Such was the general reaction to the departure of the mammoth trophy from these shores . That was in 1927 . A lot of champagne has flowed out of the Davis Cup since then , but I have n't quaffed any of it , nor has any other American who has annually kissed mom and pop good-by and forsaken fireside and business  --  if any  --  to dedicate himself to its reclamation . Somehow , there has always been a slip between the cup and the lip , and seven years after we started sending out these expeditionary forces we do n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of the business . Indeed , the prevalent feeling in tennis circles today is that the American outlook is more confused and discouraging than at any other time since we last looked upon the inlide of the cup and found the ice water good . The ? 1-to-1 trouncing we received at the hands of England in the challenge round at Wimbledon last July has finally convinced even some of the staunchest backers of American tennis that we are getting nowhere , if not actually losing ground in the quest of the trophy . The fact that we did not win a solitary one of the four singles matches when the expert dope favored us to win one and gave us at least an even chance to capture another , was just about the last straw for some . What is Wrong With American Tennis AA THAT is wrong with American tennis ? Is the V V quality of our play so inferior to England 's ? Are our players retrogressing ? Is it . their training methods that are wrong ? Is the leadership at fault ? Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others on the team ever since we came back from Wimbledon . I confess that Americans have good reason to ask them , in view of the years of disappointment our teams have gone through . But at the same time I emphatically do not take the hopeless outlook that I find so general . On the contrary , I think we have profited considerably by our past failures and made progress toward taking an objective that was far more formidable than any of us appreciated when we first started gunning to bring the cup back . We live and learn , and that goes for tennis as well as for the game of life , and , boy , I 'll say that I , personally , and the others who have taken part in those campaigns have certainly had an education on those foreign trips . They may have been a pleasure jaunt in the eyes of some and a pain in the neck to others of our detractors , but at least they brought us to our senses in awakening ( Continued en Page 104 ) appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one occasion and a string of long pearl beads on another . " After I 've bought these two things I choose everything else that season in relation to my wardrobe as a whole . There 's simply no point in buying a gorgeous red evening wrap if one 's evening dresses of the season are rose or green , It 's not only extravagant , one will never look smart . And a hat will never look well if it 's either too elaborate or too sports for the frocks with which one wears it . " I limit my clothes budget . And the first thing I learned long ago was that in clothes budgeting , violent and extreme colors were always disastrous . Simple inexpensive summer frocks , to be worn for a season and thrown away , are the part of one 's wardrobe where one can indulge a passion for gypsy colors least harmfully . " Except in accessories . A vivid green scarf and hat may happily brighten a gray tweed suit every day of a season that one feels like color . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topaz earrings and a bracelet will do the same thing for a black dinner dress . The point being , of course , that one can wear the bright accessories just occasionally , and vary them often without adding to the expense or elaborateness of one 's wardrobe to any important degree . " When I begin to talk about clothes , it always leads to talking about hair arrangements . It 's a great mistake , I think , to have an elaborate permanent us to the fact that Americans are not the only ones who can play first-class tennis . That certain condescension in Englishmen which so annoyed our forbears was no more pronounced than that certain smugness that we in this country formerly cultivated in tennis . Because France had never won the cup before 1927 nor produced more than two or three players of international stature prior to the Four Musketeers , we were disposed to regard her as a second-rate power in tennis . And , similarly , because no Englishman had won the championship of his country since 1909 , and the British had fared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gave little consideration to John Bull as a rival , once we had learned to respect the mettle of the French . Our egoism was too great to permit of our entertaining the thought that there might be others with whom we would have to reckon besides the great Cochet and his compatriots . We know better now , and in so far , at least , as we have had the conceit knocked out of us , we have made a definite advance toward winning back the cup . But my optimism for the future is based upon something more tangible than the dissipation of a complex . Far from being dejected over our past defeats and resigned to an indefinite repetition of them , I can envisage the United States winning the Davis Cupthat looks beautiful at the country club gala but a trifle silly on the golf course , in a business office , when , perhaps , one has n't time to have it set often enough . A simple hair arrangement that 's easy to take care of , that looks well mornings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Since our hair , Like our complexion , is always with us , it 's much better to give it a little attention  --  five minutes ' brushing and three minutes ' self-applied massage  --  every day than to neglect it and go and have elaborate treatments spasmodically when it 's lost its luster . A little time for the hair ; for the skin a good cleansing cream , a skin food and a mild astringent , are the necessities . The rest is just elaboration . " But the whole business of looking well groomed and fresh comes back to eating simple food , doing exercise , taking care of one 's figure and having a bit of complete rest in afternoons whenever possible . A woman who 's graceful and slender , in a rag of an evening dress bought the year the depression began , will always look better than her cousin who 's indulged her passion for cream puffs for twenty-five years and enters a. room heavily , though the cousin 's swathed in brand-new gold brocade . " And all the taking care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Twenty minutes in the morning  --  ten for exercises , and the rest for hair and complexion  --  twenty minutes in the afternoon for relaxation and a bit more attention to the skin will do , I know , because I 've never had much time to take . " within two or three years at the outside , and I venture to predict that it can be won in 1935 . I have no desire to pose as a master mind and it is not my intention to re-fleet in any way upon the thinking capacity of those who have been intrusted with the direction of our Davis Cup campaigns . But as one who has been practically living in boats headed for and back from the Davis Cup front since 1928 , and who has been in a position to get a close-up view of what has been going on behind the scenes as well as on the stage , I have come to definite conclusions as to the procedure and policies best calculated to bring victory . They are not in agreement with the methods we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , they may be all wrong , but , anyway , they are set down here for what they may be worth and let the pot shooters make the most of it . First of all , I should like to say unqualifiedly that there is no occasion for any public loss of confidence in the ea. - pacity of our players , either of the present or those who are to fill their shoes , to make the international grade . The United States is developing its full quota of first-class players , and so far as the general standard of our tournament tennis is concerned , I make bold to say that it is higher than that of any other nation . What I mean to say is that we have more players of the first water in America than are to be found in any other country . As Fred Perry has put it , a. test match between the first ten players of the United States and those of any other country would result in a slaughter of the opposition . The whole history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nation can put the best two singles men in the field , though it is true that on occasions the verdict has rested upon the outcome of the one other match in doubles . When the Doherty brothers were holding forth , England ruled the Davis Cup roost . When Brookes and Wilding were in their prime , Australasia was the kingpin . Tilden and Johnston were all that America needed to hold sway for seven years . Lacoste and Cochet , and then Cochet and Borotra , kept France at the top for six years , and now Perry and Henry W. ( Bunny ) Austin have revived the former glory and prestige of Great Britain , the nation that cradled the game and gave it to the world in the 70 's . Because of the fact that the issue is joined between so few men , the Davis Cup is hardly a representative competition for establishing world supremacy . It would be ill becoming of the United States , when the cup is in others ' hands , to suggest that any change be made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do think it pertinent and fair to point out to those calamity howlers who bemoan the decadence of American valor on the courts that because Perry and Austin were able to beat Sidney Wood and Frank Shields on their own Wimbledon courts is hardly sufficient grounds for charging that there is anything radically wrong with American tennis . I think that if our cards are properly played , our hand is sufficiently strong to win an even division of the spoils in the singles and , in view of the tradition of American supremacy j in doubles , to bring back the cup to the United States . The Chances for Victory in /935 I am not thinking in terms of 1940 , but of 1935 . If anyone asks how we can hope to do next summer what we failed to accomplish in 1934 or 1933 , without any new Giant Killers arising on the American scene , my answer is that it is a matter of procedure and not of the development of new blood to take the firing line . I do believe that we used the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the No. 2 singles assignment is strongly advisable ; but of greater moment than that in the conducting of a successful campaign is a change in the theater of the preliminary action and a more intense concentration upon bringing the players up to their peak at the psychological time . If anyone has an idea that I am sniping at Bernon S. Prentice , who was so severely and unfairly criticized for the abject failure of the 1933 campaign , he is entirely mistaken . Mr. Prentice , then nonplaying captain , was charged with bringing up to the interzone round with England a team that had gone mentally and physically stale from too much play and that had lost its bout in the training camp . Such accusations were ridiculous to me and I shall have something to say later on as to the qualities most essential for successful leadership of a Davis Cup squad and the qualifications of the 1933 captain for the post . Of all the recommendations I would make for a winning campaign in 1935 , first and paramount is the filing of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not familiar with the facts , the preliminary competition , whereby a challenger is qualified by the process of elimination to meet the nation holding the cup , is divided into zones . The purpose is to enable nations which have little prospect of surviving more than one or two rounds of play to engage in the matches without their teams having to travel unduly long distances at great expense . For instance , Canada might hesitate to send a team to Europe to play just one match , whereas she annually enters one to compete in the American zone , even though it is a foregone certainty that her representatives will be put out early by the United States . So we have the American zone and the European zone as the two great theaters of action for the thirty-odd nations that take part in the play , with the former subdivided into North and South American divisions . Western Hemisphere Tennis Ever since we lost the cup to France in 1927 , the United States has challenged in the American zone . Our lawn-tennis association has felt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition by playing its qualifying matches on this side of the Atlantic and that to switch to the European sector would be disloyal to the best interests of the game . The fact that our team would have to be mustered at a much earlier date to compete in the European zone , taking the players away from their private pursuits for a considerably longer period and involving a bigger expenditure , also entered into consideration . But in spite of the good arguments offered as to why we should continue to adhere to this policy , I am strongly of the opinion that it has been one of the chief reasons for our past failures . Before I state why , I should like to predict that our switching to the European zone , far from being prejudicial to the best interests of the competition , would work out just the reverse . The qualifying matches in the American division have been more or less farcical . Since Japan and Australia ceased to challenge in this zone , there has been no nation capable of affording opposition worthy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our unrivaled supremacy has been enough to kill off the interest of the other nations in the Western Hemisphere . Canada and Mexico habitually challenge , but their entry is hardly more than a sporting gesture to support the competition , for they know that they have n't a Chinaman 's chance of getting by Uncle Sam 's team . The other nations , China , Cuba , Argentina , Brazil and Chile among them , either failed to challenge or defaulted without playing a match . Is it not reasonable to conclude that if the United States forsook the American zone and left the field wide open to the smaller nations , the latter would be encouraged to place a team in the lists ? It would then be an open race to determine which country would have the honor of sending its players abroad to represent the American zone in the interzone match with the winner in the European division . Certainly interest could not be at a lower ebb than it is right now in the preliminary ties on this side of the Atlantic , and any change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 109 ) Now , to take the matter from a less utilitarian standpoint and with a regard for the best interests of the American team , let us consider the implications of a challenge in the European zone . As I have pointed out the competition we got in the preliminaries on this side is hardly worthy of the name and does our players no good whatever . I do not mean to be disrespectful toward our neighboring countries or to make jest of the caliber of their tennis , which hardly could be expected to measure up to that played in the United States , with its hundreds of thousands of players and long-established traditions and cultivation of the game . I aim merely to emphasize the point that our players can not get any opposition on this side of the Atlantic that will help them to bring along their game for the sterner tests in Europe . It is indisputable that match-play competition is the best preparation for winning tennis . You will never get any better by beating players below your class , even if you are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the resistance offered when you go up against your superiors or equals may raise havoc with your game and confidence . Why is it that Australia and Japan no longer challenge in this zone as they did when we held the cup , but play their preliminary ties abroad ? The answer is : Competition . But that is not all the answer , and we come to another big consideration as to why we should challenge in Europe . Anyone who has competed abroad will tell you that it is an en- ? tirely different proposition playing tennis at home , where you are familiar with the conditions , from playing tennis in a foreign land . There you have to get accustomed to the food , the drinking water , the climate , the visibility , and also to the balls , the surface of the courts and the reaction of the strings of your racket to atmospheric conditions . In brief , you not only have to do in Rome as the Romans do , you have to become a Roman for the time being . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do justice to themselves on their first trip abroad , and even the experienced ones seldom are quite able to reach the same standard of play that they maintain on their native courts . Is it not reasonable , then , to say that the longer the period of orientation , the better chance the overseas player has of adapting his game to the strange and disturbing conditions he must cope with ? Preliminary Competition When France was challenging the United States for the cup , her players came to America just as early as they could get here . They came to compete in our tournaments , in which they met the best players of the world , to tune up their strokes , and to accustom themselves to the conditions . Why , then , should we not do the same ? Instead of challenging in this zone and sending our team across a few weeks before the interzone-round match starts , why should not our players have the opportunity to go abroad two months earlier and get the competition that is denied them here and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection be raised that it would take the players out of the country for too long a period and be too expensive a proposition , my answer is that Australia and Japan sot the example , supporting a team abroad for months and expending far more than it Costs to finance a campaign of an American team . No one has criticized them for doing this , if our officials have any fear of laying themselves open to the charge of overemphasis . My answer , further , is that if such procedure would enhance the prospects for victory for the team , in the end it would be far more economical than it is to send a team over each year to lose , and it would entail less demand upon the time of the players . With the cup hack in this country , there would be only one match to play  --  in the challenge round  --  and the team would not have to be called together until two or three weeks before the competition started , instead of being drafted for a ten-week campaign , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the personal direction of the players and the process of bringing them up to fighting pitch at match time , so that they are not only physically ready but in the proper frame of mind for the big objective . My concern here is not with guarding the players against too much competition . Every player knows for himself when he is in danger of going stale ; certainly he should know it by the time he has arrived at a position high enough in the game to warrant his consideration for a berth on the Davis Cup team . Pointing for the Big Prize Who plays more tennis than does Perry , who has been going at it twelve months around year after year ? And who plays better tennis than he does ? Who was playing more tennis and better tennis than was Jack Crawford in 1933 , when he won the championships of Australia , France and England ? Who played more than did Bill Tilden when he was the absolute monarch of the courts ? In 1933 they attributed Ellsworth Vines ' collapse in the Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryn went on the same tour and played brilliantly in the Davis Cup matches . No , I have n't any fears about our men going stale from too much play . On the contrary , I think that they need more than they have been getting . Particularly do I hold that true in the case of Sidney Wood , to whom I will come shortly . It is with the putting of the proper emphasis upon the various phases of the players ' preparatory competition and with the building up of their morale and fighting spirit that I am concerned . The football coach points his team for the big game , and so must the captain of the Davis Cup team . The football eleven that goes " all out " in every game is likely to go stale and find it difficult to reach its peak for the game with its biggest rival . So it is with tennis players . If our men go abroad determined to win the championship of France or of England , regardless of all else , and concentrate on those tournaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they undertake their Davis Cup assignments . They must remember that it is the cup that is their big objective and not the winning of individual honors in tournament play , which must he only incidental , and get the proper perspective accordingly . Wimbledon is a great tournament and it is indeed an honor to win it , but for us it must be taken in our stride and our biggest effort conserved for the cup matches . Cochet was losing to comparative upstarts in early rounds at Wimbledon and was content to let Americans carry off the title , but ho was invincible when he was defending the Davis Cup for France . That was because he did not begin to point . to work himself up to a lino fighting edge , until the day of the challenge round approached . Perry never won the championship of France , nor of his own country , until 1934 but he was an altogether different proposition in the cup matches . So must our players put the emphasis where it belongs . Let them play as much as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get them ready for that killing fifth set , and for the correcting of weaknesses and flaws in their strokes . But impress upon them that it is only the Davis Cup that matters and that until the team matches get under way , relaxation and serenity will do them far more good than the strain of keeping on fighting edge through two weeks of hitter competition at Wimbledon . That is the big part of the job of the captain of the team  --  to bring his men up to the match not only physically fit through plenty of hard work but also mentally keen and fresh through the avoidance of excessive strain . Rest and relaxation in the proper surroundings are vitally important , and to this end I would urge that when the team reaches England it take a house in the country , where it will sleep better than in the smoke and gas filled air of London , and hire an American cook to prepare the same dishes to which the players are accustomed at home . The inculcation of a spirit of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here the character of the captain plays an important part . It is not necessary to have a master mind at the helm of the Davis Cup team . Players good enough to win their international spurs should know enough tennis and have enough native intelligence to fight their own battles . No one else can fight them for them when they are out on the court . The Captain 's Job Far more important is it to have a captain who is congenial , who keeps close to the boys , who has the warmth of personality to win their friendship and command their respect and loyalty . Such a personality is far more likely to obtain 100 per cent co-operation from his men in keeping good habits and devoting themselves to the cause of the team than is the one who acts the martinet . I know of no one who is better qualified to win the loyalty of his men and to look after their welfare than Bernon Prentice . I found him a real friend , congenial and kindly and over ready to be of help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of his typo for the job of handling the 1935 team in Europe . Now as to the personnel of the team . For the singles assignments , I would name Sidney Wood and Wilmer Alli son . I would put two new young players on the squad  --  Gene Mako , of Los Angeles , and Donald Budge , of Oakland , California . Mako and Budge are just about ready for international competition as a doubles team , even though they are only eighteen years old . Mako in particular shows rich promise for the four-handed game , and he and Budge have been playing a grade of doubles that is up to the best standard of England and Australia . I do not know whether John Van Ryn , of Philadelphia end East Orange , ( Continued on Page 111 ) ? ( Continued from Pude 109 ) New Jersey , is available for the team of 1935 . If he is , by all means I would add him to the squad , for he and Allison have ranked among the world 's finest doubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . I would unhesitatingly pick Van Ryn and Allison to play the cup doubles match next year , if it were not necessary to use Wilmer for the singles . Whether Allison can do double duty and play both singles and doubles is the question . If the captain of the team decides , at the time the matches are to be played , that he is physically capable of undertaking the double assignment , as Tilden and Johnston successfully did in 1920 and 1924 , and Tilden again in 1923 , I would say to play Wilmer in both singles and doubles . But I have every confidence in the capacity of Mako and Budge to shoulder the four-handed assignment and am inclined to favor saving Allison for the singles alone . However , in the event that the young Californians were not able to hit their best stride on their first year abroad , it would be prudent to have Van Ryn on hand to fill the breach . Sending six men over would entail extra expense , but if the cup is to be won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared for any contingency . Besides , the seasoning that Mako and Budge would get for the future would justify their going , even if they should fail to get into the matches . For that reason , if Van Ryn is not available , I would advocate the addition to the squad of Frank Parker , who is destined for the heights , once he can be persuaded to change his forehand . The Old Guard I have left out Frank Shields . Frank is one of the grandest fellows in tennis and his sportsmanship on the courts , which so won over the hearts of the English at Wimbledon last year , is to be held up as an example to every young player in the game , He is also a splendid tennis player with many brilliant conquests to his string . But I do not believe that Frank is a Davis Cup winner . With all of his magnificent physical attributes and a fighting heart that never gives up , he still seems unable to rise to quite the necessary heights in a challenge round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in view of his reverses last summer , and particularly the collapse of his game in our championship , it would hardly be fair to pick him ahead of Allison , who played the finest tennis of any American in this country in 1934 and is entitled to rank No. 1 for the season . Nor , certainly , could Shields be picked ahead of Wood . I do n't think that anyone will question that bones in the lower leg  --  their names escape me at the moment  --  there was but one in the upper . Therefore , in the event of amputation becoming necessary , it was the invariable practice of the better chirurgeons to cut about two inches above the knee in the case of knee injury , or to dismember at the joint itself in the case of a lower leg or foot injury . " The heart in me was pulsating quite normally when we came forth again Sidney is inherently a far more brilliant player than Frank , and capable of reaching greater heights . Allison is considerably older than Shields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis ahead of him , and he has the courage and never-say-die spirit that keeps him in the fight to the last point , Wilmer has the soundest all-around game of any of our amateurs . It is a game conspicuous for the steadfastness , length and pace of his flat drives from both sides , for the emphatic execution of his volleys and overhead smash , which are unexcelled in this country , and for the excellence of his service . Moreover , when he points for a match , you can bank on him turning in just about his best job . Very seldom does he fall into the kind of slump that Shields experienced in losing to Vernon Kirby . of South Africa , at Forest Hills in September . Allison 's victories over Wood and Lester Stoefen in the championship and his great five-set final with Perry stand as a testimonial to his prowess and to his fighting heart , and demonstrate that , though nearing the age of thirty , he is playing as good tennis as he ever did in his career . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter 's best , but I think he would have a much better chance than would Shields , and I would favor him over Bunny Austin . I say this with a full appreciation of how awfully good a player Bunny is at Wimbledon when the weather is not too hot . Wilmer has had years of experience playing under foreign conditions , and do not forget that the greatest victory of his career was gained at Wimbledon , scene of the cup matches . In 1929 he vanquished Cachet , then the world 's recognized champion , and was runner-up to Tilden for the British crown . A lot of people lost faith in Sidney Wood after what happened in the cup challenge round last year . But they overlook the fact that Sidney had no interest in his match with Austin after Perry had beaten Shields to clinch the series , and they do n't give enough consideration to the fact that he carried Perry to five sets twice abroad last year  --  in the championship at Wimbledon and in the challenge round  --  and beat Crawford in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly great players of the world . Make no mistake about that . As a strategist he has no superior , if an equal , and he has the style and strokes of a man from Mars , What Sidney needs is a lot of work . It is the fifth sot that beats him . Continual competition , with plenty of time in which to build up his muscles and stamina , and get his gorgeous strokes in full hand , would make him well nigh invincible . If I were in charge of the Davis Cup team I would see that Wood began his into the sunshine of the lawns ; withal the clean damp air of the river was a supreme joy to me after the casual discussion of such vital matters . " You are not from New York , Mr. de Lacey ? " It was young Hamilton . " I am not , " I told him . " Nor I , " he smiled . " But , I find it a place that one takes easily to the heart . Mr. Nicholas Bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Troup . " The two other young men preparations for the 1935 campaign in the early spring , or even this winter , and kept at it with periodic practice sessions and tournament . competition right through the summer . By then , I would give him an even chance against Perry and lay odds on him to beat Austin . Austin is a much better player on his own courts than he is in America , where the extreme heat wilts him , but he is not a great player , and Sidney Wood is one of the few men I have seen on a tennis court who definitely have greatness stamped upon them . Even last year , in spite of his decided lack of the necessary competition , he gave Perry a bad scare , and had it not been for the large number of foot faults that were called upon him , he might well have beaten Fred . Making Players Toe the Line And that reminds me of one other very important thing . From the day that the Davis Cup squad assembles for practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance upon their workouts and ' Call every single violation of the rule mercilessly . In America , our foot-fault judges are far too prone to be lenient and give the player the benefit of the doubt or not to call the infraction at all . In England , they call them as they see them , and so Sidney had eighteen called upon him in one match . That was enough to ruin anybody 's game . It should not happen again , and it wo n't if our players are called every time they violate the rule in practice . To sum up : We have the players to win back the Davis Cup in 1935 . But they need the most careful guidance to help them win against players every bit their equal who profit by the handicaps militating against the man competing in a foreign country . Give them the opportunity to eliminate that handicap as much as possible through challenging in the European zone . Put a captain at their head who has a warm heart and a friendly hand rather than a master mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame , as well as the physical condition to carry them through a fifth set . Get Sidney Wood out of his office and into continual competition to make the old college try for just one season . Assign a foot-fault official to sit in judgment upon the players from the start of their training , with the understanding that his badge will be taken away from him if he lets them get away with a single infraction .
