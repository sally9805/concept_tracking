Rough and raucous Governor Vargas Lugo of the State of Hidalgo seized last week from its British owners the Cruz Azul Portland Cement factory , largest in Mexico , appraised for taxation at 1,000,000 pesos ( $300,000 ) . <P> Employes of Cruz Azul recently proposed to buy the plant , offered a down payment of 3% and future payments in correspondingly minute installments . When the owners refused this offer , Governor Lugo saw his chance to invoke for the first time his State 's new Public Utility Expropriation Law , promulgated April 25 . By plucking a group of Britons whose Government happens to be on the other side of the earth and headed by an avowed Pacifist , shrewd Governor Lugo hoped to set a precedent for plucking U. S. investors . The only questions were : 1 ) Is a cement factory a public utility ? 2 ) Is Hidalgo 's law constitutional in Mexico ? <P> Having first seized the cement plant , Governor Lugo next answered these pressing questions : <P> " Public interest is absolutely preeminent . To quote from Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories , industrial or commercial enterprises . . . are considered as of public welfare and consequently as an object of expropriation for the public welfare . ' <P> " The company contends that our expropriation law is unconstitutional because it impairs the inviolability of private property . This conflicts with the modern conception of property and with contemporary laws . Property without limits would be tyrannical with respect to individuals and anarchical with respect to society . " <P> In Hidalgo are the world 's largest silver mines , owned by U. S. and British citizens , possible objects of expropriation.
