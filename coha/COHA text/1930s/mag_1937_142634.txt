The 46th season of the Chicago Symphony came to an end last week with Associate Conductor Hans Lange on the podium . Regular Conductor Frederick Stock is so old and ailing these days that Chicago rarely sees him . The rumor that he will resign is not confirmed . But Chicagoans had another resignation to mull over , and they paid their respects to Concertmaster Mischa Mischakoff by standing and cheering him a full five minutes . As concertmaster with the new NBC Orchestra under Toscanini and Rodzinski , Mischakoff will have an enviable post . Chicago will have lost its best violinist . <P> Mischa Mischakoff , 42 , seems cut out for a concertmaster . He was such a fine violinist at the Imperial Conservatory in St. Petersburg that , after the Revolution , he won a professorship to the Government Conservatory . He was only 24 when the Moscow ' Grand Opera asked him to be its first violin . Two years later he lit out of Russia , went to Manhattan , placed first in a contest of 500 violinists and got a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concertmaster of the New York Symphony , now defunct . Stokowski took him to Philadelphia , whence Frederick Stock got him for Chicago in 1930 . <P> Music is real , music is earnest to Mischa Mischakoff . He teaches 22 pupils at the American Conservatory of Music , runs his own string quartet . He plays the piano almost as well as the violin . Students dread Mischakoff 's caustic tongue but know that , at parties , he is a good fellow . A bachelor , he likes swimming , plays ping-pong gladly and badly , appears with hair mussed and bushy , clothes drooping as though too big for him . As a violin trader he is ready , shrewd , almost always wins . He regrets leaving Chicago but says he could not resist NBC 's " fabulous contract . " <P> The concertmaster is to an orchestra what the stroke oar is to a crew . He sits closest to the conductor ( coxswain ) , takes his orders direct , sets an example to the other players . NBC sent for Mischakoff because , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the NBC Orchestra must have a stroke of the calibre to which the old maestro is accustomed .
