SCARCELY anything that ever happened in or to the Great Plains has created so much interest and concern as the spectacular dust storms of this spring . While no news story can really picture a bad duster in action , the imagination of the whole country has been stirred by accounts of days when the sun never showed through the murk , of farmhouses half buried , of dust pneumonia , and lost children . Indeed , on some occasions so much silt made its way to the Atlantic seaboard that many persons a thousand miles away from the storms experienced discomfort from it . Since it is journalistic custom to single out Kansas as the locale of droughts , cyclones , and whatever other excitements occur on the plains , most of the dust stories have centered about the storms in Kansas , although of course large areas in the nine other States of the region have also been ravaged . Kansans are used to that sort of singling out and do not greatly resent it . They have their own jokes about the type of publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Whenever Kansas breaks into the New York headlines it means that one of two things has happened . Either we have suffered an act of God or else we have made fools of ourselves . " In the present instance , one would judge from the news stories , we have surpassed ourselves by combining a natural calamity with our own idiocy . The Western farmer has managed his affairs so badly that ten States are suffering extreme discomfort and anxiety . The lanky simpleton has plowed up so much grass land and put it to wheat that when a drought comes along his top soil blows off and smothers the rest of us . He should have known better . Such in essence is the popular opinion . Like most popular opinions , this one makes such a quick swipe at the truth that it is scarcely true at all . And yet the dust storms are so tremendous , both in the suffering they are causing now and in their portent for the future , that they will continue to excite the eager interest of Americans everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some detail . I shall not attempt to describe the storms themselves . That has been done in the daily press , and done well . It is only when writers have passed from description to analyses of the causes , significance , and possible remedies for " the dust menace " that exaggeration and half-truth have flourished . Seizing upon the obvious fact that much grass land in the plains States has been put to the plow in the last decade , too many observers have turned upon the farmer as the cause of the calamitous dust storms . Such a line of reasoning entirely fails to see the problem as a whole . It is as specious as would be the blaming a flood in Louisiana upon the farmers in the upper Mississippi Valley for not preventing excessive run-off on their own tracts of land . Nobody now fails to see that flood control is a social problem , a national problem , which can never be solved by appealing to individuals to fill up gullies or by bonding communities to build levees and drainage ditches . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientifically planned , centrally controlled attempt to keep it from overflowing . It is the same with the dust storms . If we have a dust menace it is because as a people we have tampered with the processes of nature without making an intelligent attempt to fend off the retribution she always deals when her processes are tampered with . It is nonsense to assume a virtuous air and blame the individual farmer , or even the farmers as a class . The farmer of western Kansas , Texas , or South Dakota has been practically helpless in the grip of forces over which he had or could have almost no control . Like every farmer since Abel , he has had first of all to contend with nature herself . With one hand she offers him a soil of matchless depth and fertility . With the other she denies him the rainfall necessary to make that soil easily productive . The whole great stretch of land between the hundredth meridian and the Rockies is so low in annual rainfall as to be rightfully called semi-arid . From the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , North Dakota , has had a mean annual rainfall of about 16 inches . From 1871 to 1922 the mean rainfall at Cheyenne , Wyoming , was 14 inches . Most of the extreme western Kansas and eastern Colorado counties have in the neighborhood of 16 inches . Amarillo , Texas , has 21.59 inches . To get a comparative idea of how scant these inches are , remember that Peoria , Illinois , has 37 and Baltimore , 43 . These , I repeat , are averages . The farmer on the high plains does not often have a year with that precise rain . fall . What he faces is one year with 12 inches , another with 15 , a third with 23 . Or he may have a series of years with 20 inches or better , followed by a series of 14 or less . His situation and , therefore , his whole technic of farming , is entirely different from that of his brother in Illinois . A " wet year " for him would be a drought in Maryland . But used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggered by the unprecedented piling up of one year after another of severe drought . This is his fourth successive year of it . For him the much publicized drought of last summer was never really broken . Since 1931 Amarillo has an accumulated deficiency of 20 inches and Dodge City , Kansas , of 19 ? practically a whole year 's moisturel But after all , the Great Drought is an emergency , a natural calamity like hail or an earthquake . In the long reach of years it is not so important as something else . The really important fact is that throughout the whole area of the high plains , some 250,000 square miles of it , every farmer except the lucky few whose land can be irrigated must adjust himself to the grim necessities of a 13 to 21 inch annual rainfall . On that niggardly quota of moisture he must attempt to wring a living from the soil . The second grim fact in the plains farmer 's universe is that so far as he is concerned the national land policy has been all wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single acre of the plains area was turned over the federal land policy began to store trouble for to-day 's farmer by permitting , if not inviting , the devastation of the grass lands . There is considerable evidence to show that the plains have not always been thinly and raggedly carpeted . When Coronado made his romantic expedition from New Mexico to central Kansas in 1541 he found a luxuriant growth of grass in the whole region . Accordin g to the historian s of the expediti on , he carried with him 1000 horses , 500 cows , more than 5000 rams and ewes , and more than 1500 friendly Indians and servants . Yet Castenad as , a member of the party , commen ts upon the fact that this great processio n of animals and men " would leave no more trace where they had Passed than if nothing had been there ? nothi ng ? so that it was necessar y to make piles of bones and cow dung now and then so that the rear guard could follow the army . " Only an extremel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinding hoofs and grazing mouths . That testimon y is corrobor ated by another early account of the range , quoted in a Departm ent of Agricultu re Bulletin of 1898 . " A stockma n who traveled with a herd of cattle through San Saba , Tom Green , and Taylor Counties all near the hundredt h meridian in Texas in the summer of 1867 , when that country was very sparsely settled , says that the grass was everywh ere from 1 to 3 feet high , and sometim es it was as high as a cow 's back not only on the bottom lands but also in places on the drier uplands . At that time there is little doubt that the range would have supporte d 300 head of cattle to the square mile . " In 1868 General Luther P. Bradley reported out of his familiarit y with army posts on the plains , " Good , fine grasses grow evenly all over the country .. . I believe that all the flocks and herds in the world could find ample pasturag e on these unoccupi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such glowing stories were sure to produce results . A governm ent conceived in and committ ed to the principle of laissez-fa ire naturally main-ta med a hands-of f policy with regard to the range . Free and unrestric ted grazing was permitte d upon the public domain . The Great Plains were all within the public domain . Here was a natural resource to be exploite d by the hustling America n enterpri ser . He proceede d with his customar y despatch and thoroug hness . Much has been said and written about the vandalism which has despoile d our oil pools and timber for the sake of quick profit . It was no more ruthless than that which speedily laid waste the range . Huge cattle compani es were promote d in all parts of the country and even in Europe . Speculati on in cattle was the favorite gamble of the day . Within a few years great fortunes were made and lost as the cattle kings entered sweep after sweep of the range . Everyon e rushed to " get mine while the getting is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one felt any responsi bility for pasturin g it wisely . Far too many cattle were run on a given acreage . Worse still , as soon as one herd had passed , another came along to snatch off the new spears just coming through the sod . No time was allowed the grass for growth and reprodu ction . The result was inevitab le . By the end of the century over-gra zing was so serious that the federal reports were pronoun cing the range " almost ruined . " In the process many of the best native grasses disappear ed , and in most localities the pasturag e became so thin that by the time the settlers arrived at least ten acres were required for each cow . II If permittin g the destructi on of the range was a tragic misstep on the part of the govern ment , the conditio ns under which it allowed settleme nt of the plains was a case of unspeaka ble bunglin g . To make the situatio n clear it is necessary to go back into one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy ( or Lack of it ) , under which the public domain has been managed and parcelled out . No other nation ever faced such a problem because no other nation ever owned a block of land at all comparable to this in area or richness . Because there were no precedents the government has had to feel its way into a policy . At first , just after the formation of the Union , Congress sold blocks of the old Northwest Territory at auction in order to secure the revenue urgently needed by the new government . That led to speculation on a serious scale . In 1820 the government took a new tack by adopting a system of low cash prices for the /and . Just five years later Senator Benton of Missouri rose to ask Congress to investigate the feasibility of providing free lands to settlers . His was the opening voice . Thousands of others joined him in an ever-increasing clamor . Land-hungry farmers and organized labor were especially vociferous in demanding the free land which was clearly in their class interest . For decades bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by the Southern States , who wanted no more territories certain to exclude slavery . Like many another momentous piece of social legislation , free land finally came as the result of a political trade . When the infant Republican Party met in convention at Chicago in 1860 it needed a platform that would unite discontented Western farmers with their hereditary enemy , the manufacturing and financial interest of the East . Accordingly it pledged itself to free homesteads , a protective tariff , and a Pacific railway ! Two years later , when Southern votes were conspicuously absent , Congress passed the celebrated Homestead Act , which was the basis , though it has been repeatedly amended , for all subsequent settlement . The Act provided that any citizen , or applicant for citizenship , who was the head of a family or twenty one years of age might unappropriated apply for one hundred sixty acres of public land and might acquire title to it by living upon it and cultivating it for five years . The response to the Act was instantaneous . Even during the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War it leaped forward as the veterans , who were allowed to deduct their years of military service from the homestead requirements , raced westward to take up claims . The rate of settlement was unbelievably rapid . Within twenty years it had pushed out to the fatal hundredth meridian . And ye it went on . By that time homesteading had become an agricultural tradition , the pioneer a revered national type . A young man 's parents had homesteaded in Eastern Kansas or South Dakota in the 60 's or 70 's . Their barren piece of prairie had become a fertile farm with fine barns and a comfortable house . There was still land to he had " out West . " Why should n't he homestead ? True , the rainfall was lighter out there , but his parents had faced drought and grasshoppers , and as the years went on had found their rainfall apparently increasing . He also could take a little initial hardship . And so the high plains were tackled . Sod houses and dugouts thrust up from the buffalo grass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the pioneers , settled down to the toughest of all pioneer jobs . Nature had made it tough enough by denying rainfall . The government had made it worse by allowing the grass lands to be devastated . And now settlement must be made under the same legal framework as that which had governed the settlement of regions with a thirty-or thirty-five-inch rainfall . There 160 acres was about the right size for a family unit . Out on the plains it was n't right at all , particularly when the pasturage was so scant . That Congress was not altogether blind to this fact is shown by the appointment in 1879 of a " Commission to codify the land laws . " Two of the duties of this Commission were to classify the remaining lands in the public domain and to make " such recommendations as they may deem wise in relation to the best method of disposing of the public lands of the western portion of the United States to actual settlers . " Two years later this Commission recommended a homestead pasturage law to permit entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inertia and the old blind faith in the social value of small holdings proved too much to overcome , and for nearly thirty years ambitious souls , stuffed on the pioneer tradition , were permitted to homestead beyond the hundredth meridian in 160-acre tracts . Much of the land was taken up by people who never expected to live upon it but who considered that the time spent in residence would be repaid by the money obtained from " commuting " or by selling to a rancher when the entry was perfected . But the great majority of the settlers came hoping to stay and build homes . There was a general belief that rainfall would increase with settlement . The heroism of the homesteader has been sung in many a romance . What the romancers fail to tell is that it was often not so much heroism which made him stick it out as inability to get away during the bad years . It took money to leave ! Those who could leave fled , and the land they vacated went back into the public domain to be parcelled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the government sat like a cynical Zeus bestowing destitution petitioned as a gift . Or in the language of the plains , it was as if the government bet a man 160 acres that he could n't live on them five years . Let no one think this a chapter out of ancient history . Homesteading is not yet a thing of the past . For so long a time did the settlement of free land offer an escape from economic stricture that even yet thousands of people every year bend their backs to the hopeless task of making a home on the leavings in the public domain . In the year ending June 30 , 1930 , there were original entries for nearly five and a half million acres . On the Great Plains this clinging to hope of economic opportunity via free land has been espedaily persistent and pathetic . During the years 1916-20 , just after the Grazing Act made available 640-acre tracts for grazing purposes and the War made a new crop of veterans eligible for short-residence requirements , homesteading in the plains States was particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor that even the enlarged tracts offered hardly a subsistence living . During those four years nearly a half million acres were homesteaded in Kansas and a similar amount in Nebraska , over nine million in Colorado , nearly ten million in Wyoming , and twelve million in Montana . During the late summer of 1917 I stayed over night in a dugout on a Baca County homestead in southeastern Colorado . In she and household equipment it was an exact replica of the dugouts built by the owners ' parents when they settled in west central Kansas thirty-five years earlier ? except for the presence of a decrepit Model T in the yard . I have never forgotten the wistful , yet determined remark of the bride who lived in that dugout . " If we can just hang on and make as nice a place out of it as the folks did out of theirs , it will be worth being lonely and doing without things for a few years . When we get the trees started , it will rain more , do n't you think ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my first introduction to the plains . And so I assured her that of course everything would be all right . But the average rainfall in that vicinity is still about fifteen inches , and there are few trees yet . My hosts have long since moved away from their acreage . And all this spring some of the most heartrending stories of the damage and suffering due to dust storms have come out of Baca County , Colorado . III The third rock-ribbed fact which the plains farmer has had to deal with is one which has plagued all farmers increasingly in the past seventy years . He has become part of the capitalistic system , and so made dependent upon the whole complicated interplay of capitalism . Originally the American farm was a practically self-sufficient unit producing primarily for its own use . To do that it grew relatively small quantities of many different commodities . Gradually it shifted into a specialized production of large surpluses of a few crops to be sold for profit . At the same time the old primitive implements like the hoe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new machines were marvellously efficient , but they forced the farmer to use a considerable amount of capital and hence threw him into a perpetual struggle with debt . And finally as the years went on , the land itself grew in value and the active farmer had to carry the financial weight of that increase . All of these economic pressures bore severely upon the plainsman , perhaps more severely upon him than any other farmer . Even if specialization had not been the order of the day elsewhere , he would have been forced to it by the exigencies of his climate . He had to grow what can be grown on a 13- to 20-inch annual rainfall . The result is a specialization much more intense than farmers elsewhere ever dream of . Editorial writers who belabor him for not diversifying his crops ( " Why , some of those farmers do n't even have milk cows and chickensl " ) betray their ignorance of what the plains farmer is up against . He raises wheat , pinto beans . sorghums , and little else for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very nature of these crops forces him to use expensive machinery . I have seen in a western Kansas farmyard a new harvester-thresher , a new tractor , and a new automobile . That was $7,500 worth of new machinery over and above the listers , plows , sod-cutters , and so on which had accumulated in previous years . That farmer 's bare little four-roomed tenant house was hardly more comfortably or graciously furnished than a slums apartment . But in his yard was $7,500 worth of new machinery . And against that machinery there was probably $5,000 worth of notes payable " after harvest . " Nor was his situation unusual . In life on the plains debt is quite as important and inescapable a factor as drought . When I say " inescapable " I mean just that . Outsiders who score the plains farmer for his extravagant use of power machinery have not grasped the fact that his only chance to operate profitably is by using that sort of equipment . It keeps him in debt of course , but he has no choice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he clears up , they are inexorably followed by bad years when his crops are nil , his machinery continues to depredate , and he has to apply for crop loans . Here , then , was the plains farmer , an individual working as an individual in the face of as grim a set of forces as any one ever faced : a semi-arid climate , a federal land policy cruelly unadjusted to his needs , an enforced specialization of the narrowest sort , and practically enforced debt . Naturally the poor wretch was alert for ways and means to make his stubborn world yield him a living . During the early years of settlement the climate was thought too dry for wheat except in the occasional " wet year " ; and since that could never be predicted in advance , wheat offered no great temptation . During those years grazing was the usual way of handling the land , and since the grass was so thin , the tendency was for land to be bought up from homesteaders and combined into the large tracts necessary for grazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new developments . The Grazing Act of 1916 opened larger tracts for homesteading and gave a new impetus to it . The War set up an enormous demand for wheat ; war propaganda made it a patriotic duty for everyone to try to grow wheat ; and war prices made it an attractive financial gamble even on land not especially adapted to wheat . And , finally , the tractor began to thump its way into the wheat belt . Of the three the tractor was the most important . Most observers have thought of it only as a time- and labor-saver . But on semi-arid land it was far more than that . It was the instrument which worked a revolution in production . Throughout the whole plains area most of whatever rain comes during the year falls from April to September . When a rain comes the farmer must conserve every precious drop of it . In that conservation the tractor has several advantages over horses . It is powerful enough to make the plows bite deeper and to pull more of them , and , because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities . Suppose an inch or so of rain comes the first of August , when the wheat has advantages of a " dust mulch , " that is , a top layer of finely pulverized soil , in holding moisture . Their scientifically conducted experiments in summer fallowing showed also what Western farmers had long known practically , that if land were listed or plowed and then allowed to lie idle for a year , it would produce nearly double the next year , and until the third year after would show increased productivity . The plains farmer seized avidly upon both technics . He raised wheat ! Sometimes he paid for the cost of his land and machinery in one year . Watching his performance , shopkeepers and bankers and lawyers in a thousand little towns saw an opportunity for a first-rate financial venture . From about 1922 till 1929 or ' 30 they swarmed out to buy Western land . Often they did not even put a tenant on it . It was a better gamble to buy power machinery and hire mechanics to run it . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speculation got under way . There was not enough soil under cultivation to meet the demands of both the resident farmer and the suitcase newcomer . More sod was broken out . In all the counties of western Kansas and eastern Colorado the jump in wheat acreage was astounding . In 1926 Hamilton County , Kansas , had 10,000 acres in wheat . Five years later there were 104,835 acres in wheat . In a neighboring county , Greeley , the wheat acreage in 1931 was almost as much as the total land in farms twenty years earlier . To a greater or less extent this tendency went on all up and down the plains . Particularly significant to everyone who has driven across the alkali trails of southeastern Wyoming , wondering how any human being could live in a homesteader 's shanty , is the fact that by /930 a quarter of a ' Billion acres in Laramie County had been put to crops ! Iv Now an agricultural shift of this sort amounts to a major assault on nature ? and nature in one of her most skittish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust storms . All that was lacking was a protracted dry spell . It was not long in coming . After several years with rather better than average rainfall in the late twenties , the Great Drought descended in 1931 . Not in the history of plains ' weather bureaus has a drought combined such length and severity and wide area . All of those hundreds of thousands of freshly broken acres , farmed according to the best semi-arid practice of dust mulch and summer fallowing , lay clean and powdery , ready for the wind which always sweeps restlessly up and down the plains . No friendly grass roots held the soil in place . After the first year or two not even stubble protected it . Naturally it began to " blow . " Here and there in scattered communities from Canada to the Gulf fine particles of soil , picked up by the rapid currents of wind running close to the earth , began to whip against neighboring particles and cut them loose by abrasion . Presently the entire field was blowing , its top soil loosening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went across a road and began cutting and tearing at the dry soil in the next field , and it too began to blow . Dust piled up against whatever obstruction it found . It drifted into fence rows and farmyards . As early as the summer of 1933 there were tales of farmers in southwestern Kansas having to excavate their tractors before they could begin to plow . Dust storms were becoming serious by spring of 1934 . That summer , as everyone knows , the thermometer stayed week after week at 108 or above , and the last bit of subsoil moisture disappeared . In the fall , when all the area east of them was well soaked , the plains remained dry . By December extension workers in the agricultural colleges were saying that wind erosion on a scale never before witnessed by Americans was in store for the plains unless rain came . No body paid any attention . Surely after so long a drought it would have to rain before the March winds got going . But it did n't . Then the dust storms began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New dust drifts appeared and the old ones piled higher . In the sandier districts fields were stripped to whatever depth they had been plowed . Even the heavier soils were affected as the blowing spread like an infection . The more it blew the more it could blow . A population choked . But there is no need to describe the dust storms of 1935 . As I write ( last week in April ) one of the worst of the year is raging , and there is no promise of relief . At last , as Governors scurried to Washington to beg funds for an attempt to control the dust by listing , the federal government realized that something really serious was going on . Early in April a sum of $250,000 was made available in Kansas for an experiment in listing . How effective this federal program will be nobody knows , because there was never before such a wide area affected . It is known that running an occasional lister furrow at right angles to the prevailing winds will stop " blowing " in a single field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with local conditions doubt that the program can be effective at the present stage of the calamity when the blowing is so widespread . If the listing could have been done early in the winter , they say , when only small patches of land were affected , it might have stopped the whole trouble . But then the drought-stricken farmer was too poor to pay for the distillate required , and the State and federal governments had not awakened to the danger . Now , when the soil rolls restlessly hither and yon in county after county , the agronomists are inclined to think ( though as I said , they do not profess to know ) that nothing but rain will halt the destruction . And it must be real rain , not just scattered showers but long , soaking rains over the whole region . If that should happen and if the winds should be comparatively calm for a while , vegetation would spring up spontaneously and life would begin over again on the plains . Even on the sandy soil , where the drifting has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . No one is predicting the outcome of it all . The experts in soil culture agree that a great deal of nonsense has been talked and written about the in-jut ) / to the soil . Professor R. I. Throckmorton , head of the agronomy department of the Kansas State Agricultural College , recently announced : " Although wind erosion has transported enormous quantities of soil from the cultivated fields of the West , it has not seriously injured the crop-producing capacity of the region . Soils have been permanently reduced in productivity only in local areas as on the more exposed spots and in the sandy regions . " Moreover , as a farmer remarked out of his practical experience , " Parting with six inches of top soil is n't so bad out here as it is in places where the soil is only a foot deep . " In the face of the facts one is inclined to smile at the pessimists who have been asserting that the plains are turning back permanently into the desert from which they came . If it does not rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sometime . On the other hand , if a cycle of moister years should open up soon , the last of the pioneers will get off relief and perhaps even out of debt for a spell . The curtain of the drama of land settlement seems to be ringing up on a note of terrible irony , but on the plains one never can tell . Rain could change the whole complexion of existence by fall . But even if a Biblical seven years of plenty should open shortly and green wheat should once more flow liquidly into every horizon , the American people should begin to understand that they have in the plains a national problem . Periods of drought are sure to recur and the wind is as sure to keep on blowing as the ocean is to keep on being salty . So long as great areas of semi-arid country are cultivated the dust menace will hang constantly over our heads . Not just over us Kansans and Dakotans , but over everyone who has been made uncomfortable by dust this spring and over everyone whose economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically everyone in the United States . I do not pretend to know what should be done about it . So far as I can find , no one knows , although all of us have our theories . This much is certain , however . Controlling wind erosion is a great national problem which must he faced as such . Individuals working as individuals might as well attempt to control the Mississippi when it has reached flood stage at Memphis as to control the action of the wind on powdered soil . One thing more is certain . Not even a central government , be its experts in soil ever so expert , can manage the plains so long as it thinks of itself as merely a first-aid kit for individualists who have got into trouble . Nothing but scientific planning and a fairly close central control of the economic activities of the area can make it really serve human needs . Until we have achieved that level of co-operative living we arc likely to continue under the shadow of a dust menace .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
