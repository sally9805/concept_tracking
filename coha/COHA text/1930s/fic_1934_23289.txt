MERCY AND THE CONDOR A STORY BY E. H. HARMENING T nc First-Class Passenger Manifest in its delicate way said simply : Mercedes Rios . Nationality : Mexico . Age : 12 years . Sex : Female . Complexion : Fair . Color of Eyes : Gray . Hair : Black . About her noble parentage it said nothing at all . Neither about her father , the all-powerful and immensely wealthy Governor of Michoacan , General Don Pedro Rios ; nor about her mother , the beautiful Doila Maria Teresa , a Princess Lichtenstein before her marriage . I got that from the Purser , who knows about everybody who is who in these parts of the world . It also said nothing about our fair passenger 's having been banished from her fatherland , like so many of her notable  --  or notorious  --  countrymen . It was none of its business . But the skipper told me . He likewise told me with great gusto hot off the griddle why they had bundled her off to that exclusive boarding school in France . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She , the Governor 's daughter . Even had gone the boys one better and , to the horror of some and the delight of others , had walked on her hands up the marble steps to the music pavilion  --  and that in a party dress . . . . One can imagine . " See that she behaves , " her mother had appealed to me , trusting probably in the three golden stripes of a Chief Officer and my capacity as a disciplinarian . I had promised , none too enthusiastic over the prospect of having to look after her ill-behaved brat . I had n't seen her then . After I had , things were different . Before me stood not a wild little Indian , but the most adorable young beauty in a short Parisian frock . Daringly short , and her mother might have known better . She wore high-heeled pumps too and bejewelled garters . One should n't believe it . Bejewelled garters ! I got quite a shock when I saw them under the absurdly short skirt , a long way from covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . And when the pretty damsel , prompted by her parent , bobbed me a lightninglike , graceful little curtsy  --  me of all people ! ? it was the Iast straw . Whether her mother liked it or not , I snapped her a most respectful bow in return , in my best manner , deep from the waist , and like a true caballero I should have kissed the back of that cool , firm little-girl hand thrust with so much friendly eagerness into my paw . That confounded little curtsy had thrown me out of gear altogether . Not to mention those maleficent gar-ters My confusion had of course not escaped the keen mother-eyes . Dofia Maria Teresa from under her lorgnette looked at me sharply , once . But again the glamorous insignia of my rank seemed a good argument in my favor and solid proof of my worth . If she had looked a little closer , she could easily have seen that the top stripe was quite new and untarnished yet by sea breezes and salt water . Of an offensive brilliancy I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methuselah and , if perhaps not the answer to a maiden 's prayer , was not an ogre either . But mothers are a queer lot . They see nothing . Not if they do n't want to . " Ach , she is only a young savage , Mercy . No more , " she confided mournfully , the young one 's acrobatic feat more likely than not still fresh in her memory . " Really , Captain , nothing will surprise me any more . For all I know , she might even say her prayers , instead of to God , to that other HutzlePutzle , whatever his name is . " " Huitzilopotl , Mammal " the little heathen had corrected her German-born mother sweetly . It was so comical , I could have laughed out loud if it had n't been for that queer note of arrogance , almost hostility , in the cultured young voice . The native daughter resented the slighting of the reverenced name . I loved her all the more for her loyalty and courage and from then on was her devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company fell a victim to the young Mexican 's charm and beauty . A little immature beauty to be sure , but what the hell ! The skipper was no exception , though he struggled valiantly to keep out of this sinister spell and while talking about her  --  which he did a great deal  --  in his gruff manner referred to her only as " The Papoose . " But he was in fact quite daffy about her . And so was I. And so were the rest of us . She could have walked all over us . She had everybody eating out of her hands , everybody . Even that beastly Condor . Ah , yes , the Condor . Thereby hangs the tale . If he did n't figure on the Passenger List , his rating was that of one just the same . For on the bill of lading as the shipper was given His Britannic Majesty 's Ambassador to the Republic of Ecuador , and for consignee none less than the King of England himself . The bill of lading said farther : In special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares of his own , had in turn recommended the Condor to me . As if I  --  the Mate ! ? did n't have my peckful of troubles without the bother of that infamous beast who , like a damn fool on a hunger-strike , had refused food and drink ever since he came on board , in the false hope of gaining that way either his freedom or else die a heroic death . At sight of the distinguished fellow-traveler the tittle Mexican stopped dead in her tracks . For a brief moment she stood motionless , both hands pressed to the heart , and stared at him in mute rapture , altogether the Indian before the feathered idol of her people , the people of all Spanish America . The next thing I knew , she was on her knees , had opened the door of his prison and , before I could stop her , had reached inside and got hold of the brute . " Ah , mi pobre , mi pobrecitor she cried in pitiful tones , over and over again , and caressed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she might have dealt with her pet cockatoo back home . And the curious fellow , who goes berserk from the slightest motive  --  all you have to do is look at him  --  he did n't ruffle so much as a feather . The gleam of hatred and cold fury died out of his eyes . A soft light crept into the deadly , menacing stare . He held quite still , entranced by the touch of the girl 's hands , the proximity of her body . His whole attitude betrayed perfect bliss . Over the little squares of raw liver , arranged nicely in a clean saucer for the bird to eat , she broke into a derisive laughter . " Por amor de Dios  --  is he to eat that ? Liver ? " In the best tradition of the ocean traveler she addressed herself to me , the omniscient Three-Striper , the know-all and cure-all Chief Mate . " So I figured , " I replied a little tartly . For dashed if I knew what else to feed the beast on . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zopilote , " she protested indignantly . " No scavenger . " And the slight intriguing frown she always wears deepened on the smooth white forehead . She looked at me in silent contempt and , after some hard and fast thinking , set off on some mission of her own . A minute later she was back again , a large piece of steak in one hand , in her wake a much surprised chef and his whole kitchen staff . Once more she crawled into the cage , only her pretty legs sticking out , and held the bloody morsel temptingly under the Condor 's eyes . But the latter refused to be tempted . With the help of his powerful bill he pushed the hand of the fair young charmer ungraciously aside in order to get a better view of her , and the enraptured took with which he fixed the girl was perfectly uncanny . We all noticed it , and so did Mercy . " Oh , deja lo  --  tu . Stop that , you idiot , " she upbraided him gently , not ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the enamored beast strove to bury its head under the hollow of her arm that she thought he was going a little too far and with a couple of good sound smacks discouraged his improper advances . Alarmed over her recklessness and the certain consequences , I quickly jumped to her aid , though there was no need to do so . For the Condormale-fashion  --  took his punishment quite goodnaturedly and  --  also malefashion  --  was not much discouraged , and when he resumed the ogling of her as before , Mercy now made short work of it and belabored him with the meat , cheerfully and systematically , until he lunged wildly forward , snatched it from her fingers , viciously tore it to bits , and in no time had done away with it to the last scrap . " You must make it live , you know , " she enlightened me about her part of the show while wiping her fingers with a definite gesture of finality on a lace-bordered wisp of a handkerchief , which afterward she tossed to the Stewardess to dispose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ever was my good fortune to witness , and for its quaintness the most remarkable in my long list of its kind . Every blessed day , with the eagerness and punctuality of the novice lover , the little Mexican presented herself for the rendez-vous with her feathered beau , feeding him in the approved manner and suffering patiently the often none too gentle caresses of the grateful beast . It was quite amusing to see those two at play and not infrequently a little pathetic . And many a time while watching the novel pair and the bird 's antics , so very like a human being in their suggestion of a lovesick swain , I wondered if some fine day this supposed Condor might not drop his disguise and , as in the old fairy-tale of childhood days , step forth the gallant young Prince in plumed hat , silks and velvet , and that be the end of the story . But it was not . The end was altogether different . There came a time when I began to feel a little uneasy about the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might have been the girl 's suspicious manner : the way she circled the Condor 's cage with stealthy catlike strides , and the furtive glances she cast in my direction when she thought herself unobserved . And I soon noticed another curious change in the little Mexican . She , who from the first day on had attached herself to me with the easy familiarity of the well-bred , well-sheltered girl who has never come in contact with men other than gentlemen , now drew away from me . Naturally I blamed the Condor for it  --  there being no one else on board I could have blamed  --  and one day when the sight of the two spooning there so shamelessly in front of everybody got a little on my nerves , I began teasing her about the bird and her strange infatuation , acting a bit the part of the jealous lover in doing so  --  a part which by the way came unexpectedly easy as I discovered to my astonishment . My fair young ward was deeply hurt , or made believe she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I am not in love with him at all , " she denied my charge vehemently with the twelve-year-old 's relish in being thus suspected . " Do n't be silly , Don Ricardo . But look at the poor dear . Have you no heart at all ? Do n't you see how miserable he feels ? " I was extremely sorry , but I did n't see and , therefore , had but little sympathy for my hated rival , the behexed Prince , and in so many words told her that she had no reason to bemourn his sad fate as he had everything he could very well wish for  --  a clean house , good food and plenty , not to mention the pleasant company . " Oh  --  that , " she dismissed the insinuation curtly with a crooked little smile . " Misery loves company , you see , " she explained for my benefit , while her fingers plucked nervously at the fringes of a priceless mantilla of snow-white silk , richly covered with the finest embroidery . This time I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid an arm over her shoulder . The result was prompt and disastrous . At once the young form stiffened , quickly defensive , and in the fine frank eyes crept a look , blank , tense , and expectant . But in the next moment she swayed toward me and before I knew lay in my arms and sobbed wildly : " I want to go home  --  oh , I want to go home . Take me home , Don Ricardo . Please , please take me home . " Poor little Papoose ! She was quite beside herself with grief and , helpless before so much misery , I took her firmly into my arms , stroked the heaving shoulders , the fine shapely head with its wealth of glossy black hair  --  black like the center of a poppy flower ? from which rose an ever-present delicate virginal scent , singularly pleasant and vaguely disturbing . Her violent sobbing ceased and she lay quite still in my arms and cried softly against my shoulder . When I seized a corner of her mantilla and proceeded to dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her distress altogether the small girl ? even to the persuasive little pout  --  turned up a tear-stained face as if expecting me to kiss away her cares . I did n't know . Should I ? Should I kiss her or not ? Then a bloodcurdling cry rent the air and the Condor , with the ferocity of a tiger , crashed against the steel bars of his prison . " Santa Maria ! " sighed the little Papoose wearily and disengaged herself from my arms . And something in that " Santa Maria " told me that I should have kissed her . It happened that same day , on the four to eight watch , off the entrance to the Magellanes . The night was fine and clear with a kindly full moon overhead as a welcome aid to the navigator . On our quarter , black and mysterious against the pallid sky , loomed the outposts of the distant Andes . Ahead winked the guiding lights of the Evangclistas . At peace with myself and the world , I walked back and forth , waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dutiful mariner 's , on the impending journey through the Straits and the various problems of its navigation . But the dangers of unsound anchorages and faulty compass deviations soon began to lose significance and became of little concern , what with the beloved Papoose and the problem of her sad plight facing me , and that unkisscd kiss still an open question and throwing all else in the shade . . . . Damn that Condor anyway . There he was again now , scratching and scraping and fidgeting in his coop under the bridge and making himself otherwise obnoxious probably because the canvas curtain was not down to protect his precious carcass from the night air . Blast him ! He could bump his fool head in for all I cared , I was n't going to stop him . But a sharp splintering crash , followed by a piercing scream , sent me heels over head to the boatdeck below . Too late . Right under my nose and almost within reach , the Condor took off from the rail and in majestic flight soared toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his claws and fluttered to the decks . A torn piece of silk , snow-white with long fringes . I picked it up and stared at it dumbfoundedly , for I knew where it did belong and , at the sound of approaching footsteps , I hid it under my jacket . " What happened ? " The skipper came up in quick alarm . I pointed at the cage , empty , its door wide open . " He got away , sir ! " " Yes , I see that . But how the devil could he ? " " I wanted to give him clean water and he got out , " I told him . " That so ? " the " Old Man " said coldly , and his eyes from under the bushy white blows swept the boatdeck with a swift searching glance . But there was a strange light in them . They were not the eyes of the hunter . Rather the opposite . There was fear in them . Fear perhaps of what he might find . Anxiously I followed the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that he asked no more questions . Not then nor ever after . " You should have known , Mister , and had a padlock put on , " he hinted gently . " Well , it 's your own hard luck if you have n't . " And as a parting shot with good-natured malice over his shoulder : " You 'll be out a fifty-dollar bonus now , young man . " After I had come off watch I went in search of the little sinner and finally cornered her near her cabin door . Silently I handed her the telltale bit of silk . She turned deadly white under the healthy pallor of her skin but , being a rich man 's child , had soon recovered her poise , and with the easy assurance of the breed to whom the word " Pay " holds no terror , said : " Oh , I shall pay for him , Don Ricardo . Or Pappa will . " After I had given her to understand that it was not a question of money  --  I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pappa " did n't come in here at all , but that no one knew and that I  --  cross my heart ! ? should never tell on her , she was caught at a disadvantage . She realized it at once , but was not discouraged . From the depth of her gray mermaid eyes  --  now almost black under the long crisp lashes  --  she measured me with a curious intentness . Determined to square her accounts at least with me then , if that could not very well be done with the King of England , she seemed anxious to know whether I was really so insusceptible to her juvenile charms as she had good reason to believe after her experience of that morning . And before falling back on those , her only resources from which she might pay me my just reward  --  orthe hush-money , as the case may be  --  she wanted to make sure if I liked this specific form of pay . If I were " on the make " so to speak . Something must have told her that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . But evidently she was satisfied . For she looked warily along the alley-way , first to the right and then to the left , and when no one was in sight , stood on her toes , flung her soft cool arms round my neck , and kissed me full and square on the mouth . Yes , I did like it , for those who care to know . I liked it very much . I am a little ashamed to say how much .
