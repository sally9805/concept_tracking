Highly indignant last week were Britain 's Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon and the Most Rev. Dr. William Temple , Archbishop of York , at what they considered a gross insult to William H. Heard , Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church ( U. S. ) . Bishop Heard , a grizzled old Negro from Philadelphia , one of 400 non-Roman Catholic Christians meeting in Edinburgh for a World Conference on Faith &; Order , had been asked to move from his hotel . <P> Hearing of this , Sir John and Lady Simon promptly invited the Bishop to visit them in their Glasgow hotel where they are on vacation . Equally solicitous , the portly Archbishop of York asked Bishop Heard and his niece to stay with him . The aged Negro , who was born in Georgia eleven years before the Civil War , has had innumerable social and professional contacts with white folks , always travels first class on ocean trips , has attended 30 international religious gatherings abroad . He graciously declined the invitations , however , said he had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edinburgh hotel managers , insisting that violent race prejudice is still largely a U. S. and German monopoly , pointed out their sole reason for drawing the color line : the presence of a Negro was likely to cost them some of their most profitable trade , the patronage of U. S. tourists .
