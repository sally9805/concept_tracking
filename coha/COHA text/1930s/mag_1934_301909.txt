Yugoslavia is a country half as large as France . Within its borders the World War was started , regicides are bred , opium is produced and the best wild boar shooting in Europe is found . The world of art knows just one Yugoslav name-Ivan Mestrovic , one of the greatest living sculptors . Last week Mrs. Marie Sterner Lintott , a talented ferret among modern artists , discovered another , Maximilian Vanka . At her Manhattan gallery she put on view 15 darkly colorful Vanka canvases . <P> Like the assassins of King Alexander , Artist Vanka is a Croat . Born in Zagreb 44 years ago , he wears a soft brown beard , likes to paint in an embroidered blouse and a black trilby hat . He is easily Yugoslavia 's best known portraitist . His painting is workmanlike , able . <P> No sooner was King Alexander murdered than all the people of Yugoslavia began wondering who would be chosen to execute the official memorial to him . Sculptor Mestrovic will do a heroic statue for the family tomb at Oplenatz . Painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
