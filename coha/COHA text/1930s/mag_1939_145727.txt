THE PATRIOT - Pearl S. Buck - John Day ( $2.50 ) . <P> One consequence of winning the Nobel Prize for Literature is that the prizewinner 's next books come in for much severer criticism . If any Nobel Prizewinner stands to escape such hardening of the public heart , it is Pearl Buck . With her usual unpretentious candor , she was the first to admit that the Nobel Prize award honored her beyond her deserts . " That 's ridiculous , " she said when she heard the news . " It should have gone to Dreiser . " <P> But , as critics realized on second thought , the Nobel Prize went to Pearl Buck only partly for The Good Earth . The democratic-minded Swedish Academy was also giving an accolade to Pearl Buck 's sympathy for the Chinese common people , and to her telling attacks , in her magazine articles , on the dictators . The influence of her writing far transcends its importance as literature . <P> By such standards , The Patriot ranks with her best work . Aiming at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time pays tribute to the common people of Japan as well as China . <P> The patriot is Iwan , idealistic favorite son of a powerful Shanghai banker . Drawn into a secret group of revolutionary students , he organizes an armed corps among the Shanghai silkworkers , narrowly escapes Chiang Kai-shek 's blood purge of the Communists in 1927 . His father saves his life by exiling him to Japan . <P> In Japan , where half the book is laid , Iwan is soon soothed by the exquisitely regimented life of the Muraki family , surmounts exquisitely ruthless objections to marry their beautiful daughter Tama . They have two sons , live a happy life-until news of the war in China leaks through the almost impenetrable censorship . When the Japanese begin bombing Shanghai , Iwan goes home to fight . But before he does so , he and Tama have made their private peace . Stoically heartbroken Tama vows to keep his photograph surrounded with flowers , not to let their sons forget him . <P> Now solidly repatriated after 35 years in China , Pearl Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walsh , on a 130-acre farm in Bucks County , Pa . She divides her great energies between tending nine children ( one of her own , her husband 's three , their adopted five ) and writing the " books I want to write . " Never waiting for moods - " you 'd never get anything done if you did " - she writes about four hours a day , in terms of episodes , never halting in the emotional crises , but never going into one just before lunch . Declaring she would rather be an " American writer than anything else , " she is gradually unlearning the habit of thinking in Chinese idiom . Her next book ( finished in fact before The Patriot ) will be a sequel to her weakest novel , This Proud Heart , her first with a U. S. setting . She says she will never again live in China , may visit it when she knows for certain " what shape it will assume . "                @ @ @ @ @
