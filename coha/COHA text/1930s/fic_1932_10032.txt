R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tfetched the Englishman . He 's plumb crazy over the view . Val , it 's grand , shore as shootin ' . " " Hank , you always had the same weakness . " " Ahuh . A man has to have weaknesses , has n't he ? Yours is whisky , hard feelin ' , an ' greediness , " returned Hays , deliberately . That sally did not set well with Lincoln , though it effectuallysilenced him . There never had been any love lost between these two men , Jim conjectured . A good camp-site left the men more leisure , except Happy Jack , who evidently liked to work as well as talk and laugh . He was capable , too . After supper Jim strolled away from camp , down to where the canyon opened upon a nothingness of space and blackness and depth . The hour hung suspended between dusk and night .

Coyotes had raised their hue and cry ; now and then a shrill whistle of a nighthawk rent the air ; crackingof weathered rock and rustling of brush indicated the presence of nocturnal animals . Hays had led up out of the barren network of canyons to the edge of a zone of life . The wind had a whisk , a tone , an icy touch of the mountainheights . While Jim Wall meditated there in the gathering darkness he was visited by an inexplicable reluctance to go on with this adventure . A blank , imponderingfate seemed to stand up , vague , indefinable , yet more bitter than a fugitive life . He could not laugh it away . It needed daylight , and clear view of this calling wilderness , to dispel unrealities . Ile had had presentiments before , all of which had turned out incredibly true , but this clamped his soul somehow . IIe seemed to catch a glimpse of that soul , in the shape of a naked man , driven to andR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S T 41fro across the sand and the rock , tormented by horrors that were not physical , tortured by a spirit within . Jim ponderingly retraced his steps . He could make but little of such a visitation , and that little had to do with his youth , his home , his sister , his mother , all of whom were but ghosts of a dim past . Every man , even these brutalized robbers , had some caverns of memory , into which sleep or unsolicited turn of consciousness thrust them momentarily . It was singular that the instant he caught sight of Hays and Lincoln lying prone on the ground , dark , still , betraying faces turned up to the starlight , this strange feeling left him . It never returned . But Jim Wall went to bed with a feeling that right then he should have found his horse and ridden off into the unknown . Next morning he remembered something like a distorteddream , but he could not recall details . He had smoked too much these several days , and the strong drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim found himself confronted by a choice of driftingon in the ways of these men or returning to the lonewolfcharacter which had long been his . For the time being he chose the former . Despite the abundance of water and feed thereabouts , some of the horses had strayed . Lincoln came in with the last few and he was disgruntled . Hays cursed him roundly . They got a late start . Nevertheless , Hays assuredJim that they would reach Star Ranch toward evening . The trail led up a wide , shallow , gravelly canyon full of green growths . Like a black cloud the mountains loomed ahead and above . Jim was glad to ride up at last ( ) tit of that interminable canyon into another zone  --  the slope of the foothills . At last the cedars !

But upon looking back Jim forgot the foreground . Had he ridden out of that awful gulf of colors and streaks ? Hays caught up with him . " Come on , Jim . This here ai n't nothin ' . Wait till we get around an ' up a bit . Then I 'll show you somethin ' . " They rode on side by side . The trail led into a wider one , coming around from the northeast . Jim did not miss fresh hoof tracks , and Hays was not far behind in discoveringthem . " Woods full of riders , " he muttered , curiously . " How long have you been gone , Hays ? " inquired Jim . " From Star Ranch ? Let 's see . Must be a couple of weeks . Too long , by gosh ! Herrick sent me to Grand Junction . An ' on the way back I circled . Thet 's how I happened to make Green River . " " Did you expect to meet Happy Jack and Lincoln there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit . But I guess you 'll more'n make up for the other fellers . " " Hope I do n't disappoint you , " said Jim , dryly . " Wal , you have n't so far . Only I 'd feel better , Jim , ifyou 'd come clean with who you air an ' what you air . " " Hays , I did n't ask you to take me on . " " Shore , you 're right . Reckon I figgered everybody knew Hank Hays . Why there 's a town down here named after me  --  I-Iankville . " " A town ? No one would think it . " " Wal , it ai n't much to brag on . A few cabins , the first of which I threw up with my father years ago . In his later years he was a prospector  --  before thet a Mormon . I never had no Mormon in me . We lived there for years . I trapped fur up here in the mountains . In fact I got toR O B B E R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country except thet Black Dragon Canyon , an ' thet hell hole of the Dirty Devil . . . . My old man was shot by rustlers . " " I gathered you 'd no use for rustlers . . . . Well then , Hays , how 'd you fall into your present line of business ? " " Haw ! Haw ! Present line . Thet 's a good one . Now , Jim , what do you reckon thet line is ? " " You seem to be versatile , Hays . But if I was to judge from our meeting with the fat Mormon at the ferry , I 'd say you relieved people of surplus cash . " " Very nice put , Jim . I 'd hate to be a low-down thief . . . . Jim , I was an honest man once , not so long ago . It was a woman who made me what I am , today . Thet 's why I 'm cold on women . " " Were you ever married ? " went on Jim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thet was the hell of it , " replied Hays , and he seemed to lose desire to confide further . Jim revolved in mind a story to tell this robber , if only to please him and establish some kind of background . " Well , Hank , my story is n't anything to excite pity , like yours . And sure not friendship . " " Ahuh . I had you figgered , Jim , " replied Hays , wagginghis head . " Shore Jim Wall ai n't your right handle . Wal , any handle will do out here . . . Do n't be afraid to tell me about yourself , now or some other time . " " Thanks , Hank . A man gets to be cautious . A rolling stone gathers no moss . " " Wal , I 'd rather train with enemies than alone . I ca n't stand bein ' alone much . " " That accounts for Lincoln . He rubs you the wrong way , Hank . " " Brad 's a cross-grained cuss , but he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . " Jim had to make conjecture about the times that did44 R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tbring out a desirable side of Brad Lincoln . And he had his doubts about it . The trail narrowed into rough going , which necessitated single file , and gradual separation of the riders . The morning was bright , cool , beautiful , with air full of sweet smells of sage , which soft gray growth had come down to meet them . Blue jays squalled , mocking-birdssang melodiously ; ring-tailed hawks sailed low over the slopes . Deer loped away among the cedars . As there were three riders ahead of Jim , none of whom got off to shoot , it appeared no time for him to do so , either . Star Ranch probably abounded with game . Jim wondered about this new ranch . It would not last long . They rode into the zone of the foothills , with everincreasingevidence of fertility . The blue , cloudy color of the still pools of water in rocky beds gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been restricted for several hours , permitting only occasional glimpses up the gray-black slopes of the Henrys and none at all of the low country . Therefore Jim was scarcely prepared to come round a corner and out into the open . Stunned by the magnificence of the scene , he would have halted Bay on the spot , but he espied Hays waiting for him ahead , while the others and the pack-animals disappeared round a gray rock-wall bend . " Wal , pard , this here is Utah , " said Hays , as Jim came up , and his voice held a note of pride . " Now let me set you straight . . . . You see how the foothills step down to the yellow an ' gray . Wal , thet green speck down there is llankville . It 's about forty miles by trail , closer as a crow flies . An ' Chet striped messy pot of hash beyond is the brakes of the Dirty Devil . Reckon a diameter of seventymiles across thet circle would n't be far wrong . Thet 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holeR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 45in there I 'd shore like to see . Wal , where the green begins to climb to them red buttes  --  there you 're gettin ' out of hell . An ' beyond lays grassy plain after grassy plain , almost to Green River . " Jim 's silence was eulogy enough . In fact , he could not think of adequate expression . " Now shift an ' look across the canyon country , " went on Hays , stretching a long arm . " There 's two hundred miles of wind an ' water-worn rock . You see them windin ' threads , sort of black in the gray . Wal , them 's rivers . The Green runs into the Grand to make the Colorado , less'n sixty miles from where you 're sittin ' your boss . An ' look at the threads meetin ' the Colorado . Canyons ! I 've looked down into Escalante , San Juan , Noki , Piute . But thet was when I rode with my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . We heard of great stone bridges spannin ' the canyons , but only the Injuns know of them . . . . Thet round-top mountain way across there is Navajo . An ' now , look , Jim . See thet high , sharp , black line thet makes a horizon , level as a floor . Thet 's Wild Hoss Mesa . It 's seventy-five miles long , not countin ' the slant down from the Henrys . An ' only a few miles across . Canyons on each side . It reaches right out into thet canyon country , which makes our Dirty Devil here look like a Mormon ranch full of irrigation ditches . Nobody knows that country , Jim . Think of thet . My father said only a few Mormons ever got on top of Wild Floss Mesa . . . . What you think of it ? " " Grand . . . . That 's all , Hank . " " Ahuh . I 'm glad you ai n't like Lincoln .

An ' this mess of rocks46  --  R O B B E R S ' - R O O S Tacross the valley is Red Rocks . An ' so on , as you 'll come to know . Round the corner here you can see Herrick 's valley an ' ranch . It 's a bit of rich land thirty miles long an ' half as wide , narrowin ' like a wedge . Now let 's ride on , Jim , an ' have a look at it . " But Jim elected to stay behind , trying to realize what it was that caused him to stare blankly , to feel his temples throb . Had he ridden half across the wild West to be made to feel like this ? Jim tried to grasp the spectacle that his eyes beheld . But a moment 's sight seemed greater than a thousand years of man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Utah his own . But on the moment he trembled , as if on the verge of something from which he could never retrace his steps . His sensations were not his to control . Across the mouth of Herrick 's gray-green valley , which opened under the escarpment from which Jim gazed , extendedvast level green and black lines of range , one above the other , each projecting farther out into that blue abyss , until Wild Horse Mesa , sublime and isolated in its noondayausterity , formed the last horizon . Its reach seemed incredible , unreal  --  its call one of exceeding allurement . Where did it point ? What lay on the other side ? How could its height be attained ? Nearer , and to the left , there showed a colossal space of rock cleavage , walls and cliffs , vague and dim as the blank walls of dreams , until , still closer , they began to take on reality of color , and substance of curve and point . Mesas of red stood up in the sunlight , unscalable , sentinels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terraces , faintly colorful , speckled with black and gray , ran out into the void , to break at the dark threads of river canyons . R O B B E R S ' - R O O S T - 47All that lay beyond the brakes of the Dirty Devil . Here was a dropping away of the green-covered mountainfoothills and slopes to the ragged , wild rock and clay world , beginning with scarfs of gray wash and rims of gorge and gateways of blue canyons , and augmentingto a region that showed Nature at her most awful , grim and ghastly , tortuous in line , rending in curve , twisting in upheaval , a naked spider-web of the earth , cut and washed into innumerable ridges of monotonouscolors , gray , drab , brown , mauve , and intricate passagewaysof darker colors , mostly purple , mysterious and repelling . Down in there dwelt death for plant , animal , and man . For miles not one green speck ! And then far across that havoc of the elements which led on to a boundless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummocky ground , and streaked by washes of gray and red and yellow , on to vast green levels , meadowlikeat such a distance , which stretched away to the obstructing zigzag wall of stone , the meandering White Bluffs along the base of which Jim had ridden for many days . " Down in there somewhere this Hank Flays will find his robbers ' roost , " soliloquized Jim , and turned his horse again into the trail . Before late afternoon of that day Jim Wall had seen as many cattle dotting a verdant , grassy , watered valley as ever he had viewed in the great herds driven up from Texas to Abilene and Dodge , or on the Wind River Range of Wyoming . A rough estimate exceeded ten thousand head . He had taken Hays with a grain of salt . But here was an incomparable range and here were the cattle . No doubt , beyond the timbered bluff across the valley lay another depression like this one , and perhaps there were many extending like spokes of a wheel down from the48 R O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tgreat hub of the Henry Mountains . But where was the market for this unparalleled range ? Herrick had selected as a site for his home what was undoubtedly the most picturesque point in the valley , if not one that had the most utility for the conducting of a ranch business . Ten miles down from the apex of the valley a pine-wooded bench , almost reaching the dignity of a promontory , projected from the great slope of the mountain . Here , where the pines straggled down , stood the long , low cabin of peeled logs , yellow in the sunlight . Below , on the flat , extended the numerous barns , sheds , corrals . A stream poured off the mountain , white in exposed places , and ran along under the bench , and out to join the main brook of the valley . Somewhat apart from both the corrals and outbuildingson the flat stood a new log cabin , hurriedly built , with chinks still unfilled . The roof extended out on three sides over wide porches , where Wall observed three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riders ' paraphernalia . The rear of the cabin backed against the rocks . Jim understood that Hays had thrown up this abode , rather than dwell too close to the other employees of Herrick . From the front porch one could drop a stone into the brook , or fish for trout . The pines trooped down to the edge of the brook . Naturally , no single place in all that valley could have been utterly devoid of the charm and beauty nature had lavished there , but this situation was ideal for riders . Hays even had a private corral . As Jim rode up to this habitation his quick eye caught sight of curious , still-eyed men on the porch . Also he observed that there was a store of cut wood stowed away under the porch . " Wal , here we air , " announced I-Iays . " An ' if you do n't like it you 're shore hard to please . Finest of water , beef , R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 49lamb , venison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mill : ! An ' best of all  --  not very much work . Haw ! Haw ! " " Where do we bunk ? " asked Jim , presently . " On the porch . I took to the attic , myself . " " If you do n't mind I 'll keep my pack inside , but sleep out under the pines , " responded Wall . When at length Jim carried his effects up on the porch Hays spoke up : " Jim , here 's the rest of my outfit . . . Fellers , scrape acquaintance with Jim Wall , late of Wy-oming . " That was all the introduction Hays volunteered . Jim replied : " Howdy " and left a return of their hard scrutiny until some other time . Hays went at once into low-voiced conference with these four men . Happy Jack hauled up the supplies . Brad Lincoln occupied himself with his pack . Jim brought his own outfit to a far corner of the porch . Then he strolled among the pines , seeking a satisfactory nook to unroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a decided need of vigilance , preferred to sleep in coverts like a rabbit , or any other animal that required protection . He was not likely to depart from such a habit , certainly not while in the company of Hank Hays and comrades . His swift glance at the four members new to him had not been comprehensive , but it had left a sharply defined impression . Any rancher who would hire this quartet of lean , dark-faced , hard-lipped , border-hawks for cowboys was certainly vastly ignorant , if not mentally deranged . Jim was most curious to meet the English rancher . At length he found a suitable niche between two rocks , one of which was shelving , where pine needles furnished a soft mat underneath , and the murmur of the brook just faintly reached him . Jim would not throw his bed where the noise of rushing water , or anything else , might precludethe service of his keen ears . There was no step on50  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S This trail now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust one or more of these other men . Hays exemplified the fact of honor among thieves . Jim had come to that conviction . This robber might turn out big in some ways . Chapter FourNOT until the following morning did Jim Wall get a satisfactory scrutiny of the four members of Hays ' outfit . His first impression was that not one of them had ever been a cowman , which gave their presence there such incongruity . Nor would any of them ever see their thirtieth year again . Before breakfast , at the table , and afterward , out on the porch , it was give and take between Wall and this quartet . His lot had never been cast with just such men , but he knew how to meet them . The eldest , who answered to the name of Mac , was a cadaverous-faced man , with a clammy skin and eyes like a ghoul . He was always twisting and squeezing his hands , lean , sinewy , strong members . " Whar you from ? " he had asked Wall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' before thet , Texas , I 'll gamble . " " Funny how I 'm taken for a Texan , for I 'm not . I never was in that state . " " Not funny atall , " replied the other , with a laugh . " Leastaways not to Smoky hyar . Haw ! Haw ! You shore have the look of a Texan . " " Hope that 's not against me here in Utah . " " Jest contrary , I 'd say , " rejoined Mac . Jeff Bridges , a sturdy , tow-headed man of forty or thereabouts , probably once had been a farmer or a villager . He had a bluff , hearty manner , and seemed not to pry under the surface . " Glad Hank took you on , " he said . " We need one cattlemanin this outfit , an ' that 's no joke . " Sparrowhawk Latimer , the third of the four , greatly resembled a horse thief Wall had once seen hanged5152 .

Must be populated now . It was n't a healthy place then . " " Lots of ranchers , riders  --  and sheriffs , " returned Jim , easily . " That 's why I rode on . " " Wal , them articles is scarce hyar . Utah is wild yet , except over east in the Mormon valleys . " Hays had said to Slocum , the fourth member of this quartet , " Smoky , you an ' Wall shore ought to make a pair to draw to . " " You mean a pair to draw on , " retorted the other . He was slight , wiry , freckled of face and hands , with a cast in one of his light , cold-blue eyes . " Hell , no ! " snorted the robber , in a way to fetch a laugh from his men . " Not on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambler , Stud Smith , who works the stage towns an ' is somethin ' of a gunslinger ? " " I ai n't forgot him . " " Wal , we set in a poker game with him one night . I was lucky . Stud took his losin ' to heart , an ' he shore tried to pick a fight . First he was goin ' to draw on me , then shifted to Jim . An ' damn if Jim did n't bluff him out of throwin ' a gun . " " How ? " " Jim just said for Stud not to draw , as there was n't a man livin ' who could set at a table an ' beat him to a gun . " " Most obligin ' an ' kind of you , Wall , " remarked Smoky , with sarcasm , as he looked Jim over with un- satisfied eyes . " If you was so all-fired certain of thet , why 'd you tip him off ? " " I never shoot a man just because the chance offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I3 E R S ' R O O S T 53There was a subtle intimation in this , probably not lost upon - locum . The greatest of gunmen were quiet , softspoken , sober individuals who never sought quarrels . They were few in number , compared with the various types of would-be killers met with on the ranges and in the border towns . Jim knew that his reply would make an enemy , even if Slocum were not instinctively one on sight . There was no help for these things , and self-preservation lay solely in being able to instil doubt and fear . Respect could scarcely be felt by men like Slocum . Like a weasel lie sniffed around Jim . " You do n't , eh ? " he queried . " Wal , I work on the opposite principle . Reckon I 'll live longer . . . . Wall , you strike me unfavorable . " " Thanks for being honest , if not complimentary , " returnedJim . " I ca n't strike everybody favorably , that 's sure . " I-lays swore at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell do you have to pop up with a dislike for him ? " " I did n't say it was dislike . Just unfavorable . No offensemeant . " " Aw , buffalo chips ! " ejaculated Hays , in disgust . " You ca n't be pards with a man who strikes you unfavorable . " " I have been , up to the limit . " " Smoky , I wo n't have no grudges in this outfit . I 've got the biggest deal on I ever worked out . There 's got to he harmony among us. " " hank , you 're in your dotage . Harmony among a bunch of grown men , all hard , bitter , defeated outlaws ? Bah ! " " Smoky , because you 're an outlaw does n't make me one , or IIappy or Brad or Mac or any other of us , unless Jim here . He has n't confided in me yet . " " I 'm no outlaw , " declared Jim , coolly . " It 's a little matter thet 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B E R S ' R O O S Tlishman has money enough to fetch the law out on this border . There 's your mistake , Hank . I 've been ag'in ' this deal an ' I 'll stay ag'in ' it . " " Same here , " interposed Lincoln . " Wal , we do n't agree , " said Hays , calmly . " An ' thet 's nothin ' . But Smoky bobbin ' up ag'in ' my new manthet'sserious . Now let 's lay the cards on the table . . . . Jim , do you want to declare yourself ? " " I 'm willing to answer questions  --  unless they get nasty , " replied Jim , frankly . He had anticipated some such circumstance as this , and really welcomed it . " Will you tell the truth ? " queried Slocum , bluntly . " I 'll agree to  --  if I answer at all , " rejoined Jim , slowly . " How do you size up Hank an ' his outfit ?

" " Smoky , it was a fool thing to do , but I just could n't help it , " declared Hays , in exasperation . " We 'll be huntin ' a roost in the canyons before long , " declared Slocum , derisively . And then he addressed Wall again : " Thet puts another complexion on your showin ' up with Hank . All the same , since we started this , I 'd like to ask a couple more questions . " " Shoot away , Smoky , " rejoined Jim , good-humoredly , as he sensed now less danger of a split . " You got run out of Wyomin ' ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemp . " " Rustlin ' ? " " No .

Then we held up a train  --  blew open the safe in the express car . " " What 'd you get ? " queried Slocum , with an intense interest which was reflected in the faces of his comrades . " Not much . Only sixty thousand dollars in gold . It was hard to pack away . " Smoky 's low whistle attested to his admiration , if no more . The others stood spellbound .

" grinned Hays , his face lighting . " No . " " Guns ? " flashed Slocum , penetratingly . Jim laughed . " One gun , anyhow . " They all laughed . The tension seemed released . " Smoky , I call it square of Wall , " spoke up Hays . " He shore did n't need to come clean as thet . " " It 's all right , " agreed , Slocum , as if forced to fair judgment . Yet he was not completely satisfied , and perhapsthat was with himself. flays plumped off the porch rail with boots ringing his relief and satisfaction . " Now , fellers , we can get to work .

" Jim lost no time in complying with his first order from the superintendent of Star Ranch . What a monstrous and incredible hoax was being perpetrated upon some foreigner ! Jim had no sympathy for him . He was just curious . Evidently there had been ranchers here in this valley before Merrick. 01 ( 1 log cabins and corrals adjoining the new ones attested to this .

Burros were braying allR O B B E R S ' R O O S T - 57over the place ; horses whistled and neighed ; turkeys gobbled ; pigs squealed ; roosters crowed ; sheep baaed . It was certainly a farm scene , and despite the overcrowding , the disproportion to the natural effects of a normal ranch , was colorful , bustling , thrilling in the extreme . He would have been willing to wager something that no Westerner had ever seen a barn like the one newly erected . Jim did not know whether to proclaim it a monstrosityor a wonderfully new and utilitarian structure . Probably it was English in design . If Herrick did not mind expense , this sort of improvement was all right . There were fences new and puzzling to Jim , as in fact were all the peeled-log constructions . Jim passed cowboys with only a word or a nod .

He talked with a stable-boy who proved easy to make friends with , and to an old man who said he had owned a homestead across the valley , one of those Herrick had gathered in . Jim gleaned information from this rancher . Herrick had bought out all the cattlemen in the valley , and on round the foothill line to Limestone Springs , where the big X Bar outfit began . Riders for these small ranches had gone to work for Herrick . They were Mormons . Jim concluded this was a desirable state of affairs , because it might account for the natural antagonism sure to arise between the real cowboys and the older employees of uncertain vocation . He was told , presently , that Heeseman , with ten men , was out on the range . Presently Jim encountered Hays , accompanied by a tall , floridly blond man , garbed as no Westerner had ever been . This , of course , must be the Englishman . He was young , hardly over thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B B E R S ' R O O S T " Mr. Herrick , this is my new hand I was tellin ' you about , " announced I lays , glibly .

" " So I was tellin ' the boss , " interposed Hays . " But I 'm shore , Jim , you 're equal to thet . " " As T understand ranching , " went on 1 lerrick , " a foremanhandles the riders . Now as this ranching game is strange to me , I 'm glad to have a foreman of experience . I was advised in Salt Lake City and at Grand Junction not to go in for cattle-raising out in this section . The claim was that the Henry Mountains was a rendezvous for several bands of steer thieves . That fact has been veri-R O B B E R S ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whom I bought land and cattle . My idea , then , was to hire some gunmen along N itl- the cowboys . Hay 's name was given me at Grand Junction as the hardest nut in eastern Utah . Not so flatteringto Mr. Hays , by Jove ! but eminently satisfactory to me . So eventually my offer reached Hays and he consented to work for me , in the capacity , you understand , as a buffer between me and these cow-stealers . It got noised about , I presume , for other men with reputations calculated to intimidate thieves applied to me . I took on Ieeseman and his friends . . . . Would you be good enough to give me your opinion , Wall ? " " It 's not an original idea at all , Mr. Herrick , " respondedJim , frankly , seeing the impression he was makingon the Englishman . " That has been done before , in some cases , even to the setting of a thief to catch a thief . Its value lies in the fact that it works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense  --  and risk , I might add  --  of hiring Heeseman 's outfit . " " Expense is no object . Risk , however  --  what do you mean by risk ? " " Between ourselves I strongly suspect that Heeseman is a rustler and head of the biggest Mount Henry gang . " " By Jove ! You do n't say ? This is ripping . Heeseman said the identical thing about Hays . " Jim was on the lookout for that very thing . " Hays will kill Heeseman for that , " retorted Jim , curtly . " But of course not while he 's in your employ . . . . It seems important , Mr. Herrick , for you to understandsomething of Western ways . There is a difference between hard-riding , hard-gambling , hard-shooting Westernersand rustlers , although a rustler can be that , too . But rustling is low-down . Hank Hays ' father was a Mormon prospector . Hank never grew up with cattle . But with horses . He has been a horse-trader ever since60 R O B B E R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you go over to Green River , to Moab , and towns to the east you will hear that Hays is absolutely not a rustler . " " I took flays at his word , " replied the Englishman . " Heeseman slid not impress me . It 's rather a muddle . " " Wal , Mr. I-Ierrick , do n't you worry none , " interposedHays , suavely , " Shore 1 do n't take kind to what Heeseman called me to your face , but I can overlook it for the present . Just let Heeseman ride on till he piles up . Then it wo n't be our fault , an ' whatever blood-spillin ' comes of it ca n't be laid to you . Besides , so long as you hire his outfit you 'll be savin ' money . Jim had it figgeredwrong about expense . You see , if IIceseman is workin ' for you he ca n't rustle as many cattle as if he was n't . " " Meanwhile we will be learning the ropes , " put in Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought n't sell a steer this summer . " " Sell ? I 'm buying cattle now . " " That makes our job easier , " returned Hays , with veracity . " Anythin ' come of thet deal you had on with thet Grand Junction outfit ? " " Yes . I received their reply the other day , " rejoined Herrick . " We 'll have to send a letter to Grand Junction to close the transaction . . . . By Jove ! that reminds me . I had word from my sister Helen . It came from St. Louis . She is coming through Denver and will arrive at Grand Junction about the fifteenth . " " Aw yes , I recollect  --  a sister comin ' out , " replied Flays , constrainedly . " Young girl  --  if I may ask ? " added Jim , haltingly . " Young woman . den is twenty-two . " " Comin ' for a little visit ? " asked IIays .

Helen and I are alone  --  except for distant relatives . We are devoted to each other . If she can stick it out in this bush I 'll be jolly glad . " " Ahuh , " replied Hays , without his former radiance . " Utah ai n't so good a place for a young woman . " " How so ? By Jove ! she will love it ! " " Rough livin ' . Rough men . No women atall . An ' Mormons ! . . . Excoose me , Mr. Herrick , but is this here sister a healthy girl ? " " All English girls are healthy . She 's strong and rides like a Tartar . It 's conceivable that she 'll turn Star Ranch on end . " " I reckon any good-lookin ' girl would do thet , Mr. Ilcrrick , " said Hays , resignedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we only guarantee to handle rustlers . " " By Jove ! you 'll have to handle these Mormon cowboys , too , " laughed Herrick . " Can you drive from Grand Junction in one day ? " " Shore . Easy with buckboard an ' good team , " replied I ays . Jim Wall sustained his first slight reaction of dismay . Their colloquy was interrupted by cowboys driving a string of heifers through the yard before the stable . And when they had passed Herrick resumed his walk with I lays , leaving Jim to his own devices . Jim strolled around the corrals , the sheds , down the lane between the pastures , out to the open range , where for miles the gray was spotted with cattle , and back to the blacksmith shop . Here he scraped acquaintance with the smith , who proved to be a genial fellow named Crocker . He was another of the homesteaders Herrick had bought out , but he was not a Mormon . Manifestly he and his farming associates had been bewildered by the62 . R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S Tonslaught of the Englishman upon their peaceful valley , and were frankly far the richer for it . From the smithy Jim gravitated up the winding road to the top of the bench , where the rambling , yellow ranchhouse , so new he smelled the rosin from the peeled logs , and the stately pines , and especially the view down the valley , wrought from him a feeling he seldom experienced  --  envy . How inconceivably good to own such a place  --  to have a home  --  to be able to gaze down the trails without keen eyes alert for riders inimical to life , and to revel in the far-flung curves and spurs and deeps of the desert ! It was something Jim Wall could never know . His lot did not lie in the pleasant lanes of life . This Englishman 's sister  --  this Helen Herrick  --  she would be coming to a remote , wild , and beautiful valley that any healthy-minded girl would love . But whatever the joy of reunion with her brother and the thrill of such unfettered life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy . Jim did not like the idea . A woman , especially a handsome one , always made trouble for men , though on the moment Jim was thinking only of her . What queer people the English ! He remembered a gambler at Abiline , an immaculate , black-frocked , white-vested Englishmanwho frequented the dives of that frontier cattle town . He had been the coldest , nerviest proposition Jim had stacked up against . This Herrick had something of the same look , only one of pride and position instead of disgrace and ruin . What would the girl be like ? Twentytwoyears o1 ( 1 , strong , a horsewoman , and handsome  --  very likely blond , as was her brother ! And Jim made a mental calculation of the ruffians in Herrick 's employ . Eighteen ! More , for including himself there were nineteen . He seemed to feel disgust at the prospect of his being party to the misfortune of a young woman . But here , asR O B B E R S ' - R O O S T  --  63in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very things he might have avoided . Why rail at circumstance ? Hank Hays had befriended him , even i f his aim was selfish . Beggars could not be choosers . A robber should not be squeamish , and he , for one , could not be treacherous . Still Ile strode on and let action change the current of his thought . Avoiding another long gaze at the vast expanse half a hundred miles below , yet exquisitely clear in the rarefied atmosphere , he found a precipitous path down to the level , whence he made his way back to Hays ' cabin , satisfied yet dissatisfied with the morning . Chapter FiveJ IM passed the afternoon astride his horse , familiarizinghimself with the valley adjacent to the ranchhouse . Riding through the sage was a pleasure to which he had not treated himself for a long while . It added to his growing conception of Star Ranch . On the way in he passed Heeseman 's camp , a group of soiled tents and a chuck-wagon , situated on the opposite side of the bench from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench was stony there and unscalable . A road passed the camp , heading straight for the notch in the valley , and the pass between these two spurs of the Henrys . This was the main road to Grand Junction , a long fifty miles distant . Jim halted to pass the time of day with the cook , a burly fellow busy at the shelf end of his wagon . " Howdy ! Is this Ileeseman 's outfit ! " asked Jim , civilly . " Howdy yourself ! Git down an ' come in , " replied the man , taking stock of Jim . " The boss has n't rid in yet . " " Then I wo n't wait . About grub-time over at Hays ' cabin . Will you tell Heeseman I left my respects ? Jim Wall , late of Wyoming . " " Jim Wall , huh ? Sure I 'll tell him . It 's more'n any other of IIays ' outfit has done , " replied the cook , gruffly . " They 're an unsociable bunch . We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the barnyards , meeting leanfacedriders , mere boys in years , who eyed him askance and whispered among themselves . Upon arriving at the corral near IIays ' cabin he unsaddled and turned Bay loose with the other horses there . He left his saddle , too , but took his Winchester . R O B B E R S ' R O O S T  --  65IIays greeted him from the porch bench , where he sat among several of his men . " Where you been , Jim ? Gettin ' the lay of the land ? " " Just taking heap look ' round , as an Indian would say . Stopped to say hello to Heeseman , but he was n't in camp . " " Wal , there 's nothin ' wrong with your nerve , Jim . I 've just been tellin ' Brad an ' Sparrowhawk here how favorableyou hit the boss . " " Come an ' get it before I throw it out for the other hawgs , " yelled Happy Jack , cheerfully , from within . There ensued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came upon Smoky Slocum just in the act of sitting down on a box seat , at the end of the long table . Jim kicked the box , which moved away just the instant Smoky stooped and sank . He thudded heavily to the floor with most ridiculously clumsy action . A howl of glee ran from that end of the table up to the head , when Hays , standing aside to see , suddenly roared . Smoky slowly got up , feeling of his rear and glowering at Jim . " Ca n't you see where you goin ' ? " he growled . " Accidentslike that have cost damn fools their lives before this . " " Slocum  --  I ca n't lie  --  about it , " laughed Jim . " It was n't an accident . " " You dumped me on purpose ? " bellowed the little man . " I kicked the box . . . . Just could n't help it . You 'd have done the same to me . " " Wal , I 'll be - - ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a trick-player in camp . If you'dlied about thet , Mr. Wyomin ' Wall , I reckon I 'd burnedyou where you set down . . . . Laugh , all you durnedjackasses ! But it ai n't funny . It jarred my teeth loose . " Hays laughed longest , evidently taking the incident6466 R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tas another clever move of Jim 's , upon whom he beamed . Then he led the assault upon Happy Jack 's ample dinner . At the conclusion of the meal he said : " Fellers , we 've a pow-wow on hand . Clear the table . Fetch another lamp . We 'll lay out the cards an ' some coin , so we can pretend to be settin ' in a little game , if anybody happens along . But the game we 're really settin ' in is the biggest ever dealt in Utah . " So it came to pass that Jim Wall sat down with a crew of robbers to plot the ruin of a rich and eccentric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hays . " An ' one of you step out on the porch now an ' then . Heeseman might be slick enough to send a scout over here . ' Cause we 're goin ' to do thet little thing to him . . . . Happy , dig up thet box of cigars I 've been savin ' . " " Cigars ! " ejaculated Smoky Slocum . " Ilank , trot out some champagne , " jeered Brad Lincoln . " Nothin ' to drink , fellers , " returned Hays . " We 're a sober outfit . No gamblin ' for real money . No arguin ' or fightin ' . . . . Any of you who does n't like thet can walk out now . " They were impressed by his cool force , as well as by the potency of the future . Certainly not one of them moved . " All right . Wal an ' good . We 're set , " he went on . " TodayI changed my mind about goin ' slow with this job . Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to this sudden right-about-face . I lays was deeper than he had appeared at first . " Herrick reckons there are upwards of ten thousand head of stock on the range .

So there 's twelve thousandgood . Thet 's a herd , fellers . Can it be drove ? " " Are we a lot of cowboys ? " queried Lincoln , scorn-f ully . ' No , an ' neither air we a lot of rustlers , " resumed Hays , just as sarcastically . " If you ca n't help me figger , why , just keep still . . . . Air there any of you who would n't care to play a game for twelve thousand head of cattle at forty dollars per ? " There did not appear to be a single one . " Ahuh . Wal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big herd ? " Hays this time directed his query at Jim . " How far ? " asked Jim . " Fifty miles . Fair to middlin ' road . We can meet buyers there who 'll pay an ' no questions asked . No stiff count . " " Yes . With eight riders well mounted it can be donein three days  --  provided they do n't have to fight . " " Aha ! " said Smoky puffing a cloud of smoke . " Wal , we 'd have to fight shore as hell . An ' Heeseman'soutfit is bigger than ours . " " No sense in stealin ' stock for some other outfit , " added Brad Lincoln . " Agree with you , " returned Hays , promptly . " I did n't like the idee . But it 's so damn easy ! " " Boss , listen to this idee , " spoke up Smoky . " Most of these Star cattle range down the valley twenty miles belowhere . How 'd it do for say five of us to quit Herrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Junction an ' arrange to have your buyers expect a bunch of cattle every week . A thousand to two thousand head . We 'd make the drives an ' keep it up as long as it worked. 68 R O B B E R S ' R O O S TYou 're boss , an ' Wall here is foreman . You could keep the cowboys close to the ranch . " " Smoky , it 's shore a big idee , " declared Hays , enthusiastically . " But what about Heeseman ? " " Wal , we could n't keep it from him . " " Not very long , anyway . " " Heeseman 's the rub . We got ta do away with him . " " Let 's clean out his bunch . " Hays shook his shaggy head over these various replies . " Fellers , if we pick a fight with thet outfit , some of us will get killed an ' others crippled . Then we could n't pull the deal . A better idee is for one of us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd bust the outfit . " " Who 'd you pick on to do thet , Hank ? " Jeff Bridges boomed out : " Why , Smoky , of course , or Brad . " " Nope , " said Hays , shaking his head . " With all thet 's due Smoky an ' Brad I would n't choose either . J im , here , is the man for thet job . " " An ' why ? " demanded Smoky , in the queerest of tones . Whether he was insulted or jealous would have been difficult to say . " Wal , for two reasons . Jim has it on any of us handlin ' a gun , an ' second " How do you know thet ? " interposed Lincoln , acidly . " IIell 's fire ! " burst out Hays , suddenly ablaze . " There you go , you - - - ! I suppose you think I ought to let you try Jim out ? Wal , you can gamble on this . If I did We ' ( l be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim personally was relieved to see this little by-play . It showed Hays was a strong leader and it gave a line on the testy Slocum and the taciturn Lincoln . " Go on , boss . I 'm shore we figger you have the bestR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 69for all of us at heart , " spoke up Mac , for the first time . " You never played no favorites . " " Jim . it 'd be murder for you to throw a gun on Heeseman , " said Hays , spreading wide his hands . " I 'm like Brad . How do you know that ? " rejoined Jim , coolly . " Wal , Heeseman 's gifts do n't lie thet way . He 's killed a couple of men thet I know of . But I 'll bet I can go pick a quarrel with him an ' do it myself . To be dead certain , though , we 'd better sic Jim on him . Besides , Heeseman does n't know Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better plan is to waylay Heeseman an ' his outfit , " said Lincoln . " Do for him sure an ' all or most of his men . There 's a couple of rattlesnakesamong them . " " Waylay them , huh , " mused Hays , scratching his unshavenchin . " Sort of low-down for us . " " We 're playin ' for big stakes . " " Mebbe we could drive off six or eight thousand head of stock before Heeseman ever found out , " put in Smoky . " What 's the sense of fightin ' it out till we have to . Let 's do n't cross any Dirty Devils till we come to them . " The suggestion found instant favor on all sides . " But we do n't want Ileeseman trailin ' us , " expostulatedHays . " You mean after we pull the deal ? " queried Brad , incredulously . " Shore I mean after . " " Wal , what in thunderation do we give a damn for him , when we 've got the coin an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find ? " " I do n't just like the idee , fellers , " replied Hays , evasively . Jim Wall , studying the robber leader closely , imagined that Hays was not exposing all the details of his plot. 70 ROBBERS '  --  ' R O O S T " Aw , to hell with Heeseman , before or after ! " exclaimedSmoky . " Let 's put my idee to a vote . " When this suggestion was solemnly complied with , making use of the deck of cards , it was found that Slocumhad won . " So far so good , " said Hays , as if relieved . " Now let 's see . . . . Smoky , tomorrow you take your gang , includin ' Brad , an ' quit . Pack a slue of grub an ' grain , an ' hide out below . Cache what you do n't need . I 'll go to Grand Junction for new hands . See ? But all I 'll come back with will be instructions for you to follow . Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' how about the cash ? " " Wal , them buyers wo n't pay me in advance , you can gamble on thet . But they 'll pay you . Just divide with your outfit an ' save our share . " " Short an ' sweet . I like it more all the time , " declared Smoky . The trust imposed upon him sat lightly . Jim had no doubt of his honesty with his leader and comrades . Herein lay another reason for the loyalty to Hays . The robber began to loom to Jim . " We 'll want to know where your camp is , " went on Hays . " Reckon I 'd better ride out with you tomorrow . " " No . You rustle for Grand Junction . We 'll see thet Happy an ' Jim know where to find our camp . " Jim thought of something . " Men , has it occurred to you that you ca n't drive cattle up this road and through the ranch ? " " Shore . No need . It 'd be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll drive round by Limestone , an ' up the other valley road . About the same distance to Grand . " " Air we forgettin ' anythin ' ? " muttered the leader , his big eyes staring into space . R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 71 " Nothin ' but Heeseman , " croaked Lincoln . " Wal , there are a couple of more things , but we need n't go into them now , " responded the leader . He slid several cigars into his vest pocket , and throwing the box upon the table he said : " Divide ' em even . An ' I hope it wo n't be your last dollar smoke . " The conference ended . Hays turned to the open fire , and seeking a seat in the shadow by the chimney , he pondered . It was Jim 's opinion that the chief had vastly more on his mind than he had divulged . Lincoln gave him a suspicious stare . The others seemed eminently pleased with the outlook , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joked and smoked . " Let 's play noseys , " suggested Happy Jack . A howl of protest and derision went up from half those present . " I 'd play for two-bits a card , but not just to have my beak all red , " said Smoky . " What kind of a game is noseys ? " asked Jim , curiously . " Set in with Happy an ' see . " " What 's it like , Happy ? " " Wal , it 's better'n poker , any day , " replied Happy Jack . " Takes as good playin ' . A hell of a lot more guts . An ' does n't lose you much money . . . . You deal three cards around . First feller left of dealer leads . You have to followsuit . If you ca n't you draw off the deck till you can . High card , of course , takes trick . When the decks all drawn you have to eat the card led . Thet is you take it up an ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not me . I want to know where the noseys come in . " " Wal , whoever gets left with any cards , even one , is the loser . An ' everybody gets three whacks at his nose with three cards only . Also he has to pay two-bits to every player for each card he 's left with . " 72 . R O B B E R S ' R O O S T " Fine game for this outfit , " laughed Jim . " Shore there air a lot of big beaks to beat . It 's the fightenest game you ever seen . " Jim bade them good-night and went out . His last glimpse of Hays was thought-provoking . Lighting anothercigar , which he vowed would be the last of his smoking for a while , Jim strolled up and down the porch , revolving in mind the conference . It was a spring night , starry , with an edge on the mountain air that meant frost in the morning . Coyotes were barking . And there came another sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frogs . Plaintive , sweet , they probed the deeps of memory . Jim did not like the night so well as the day . And although he had crossed the Rubicon , had involved his word and meant to see this deal through , he liked it less and less . Was it possible that this lantern-eyed robber had evil intentions toward Herrick 's sister ? Jim scouted the suspicion . Certainly , if the man was susceptible to women , he would react normally under favorable conditions . But to plot more than he had expressed , to involve his men in somethingvastly worse than the mere stealing of a herd of cattle , to betray them with murder and abduction  --  No ! this Hank Hays was too big a man for that . He had the loyalty of his band . And yet " Damn the girl part of it , anyhow , " he muttered , flinginghis half-smoked cigar out into the noisy brook . Why did a woman have to come along to upset the best-laid plans of men ? Jim went to his comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shadows , listening to the whispers about him . The very rocks seemed to have voices . Nature had endowed Jim with sensitiveness and life had dealt him iron . The harder he grew the moreR O B B E R S ' R O O S T . 73this secret , deeply-hidden faculty of feeling had to be resisted . The next morning brought sombre faces and action . Five of Hays ' outfit rode away with six of the pack horses and most of the supplies . Hays watched them until they disappeared among the cedars . " Wal , now I 'll brace the boss , " he said . " What excuse will you give him ? " " Anythin ' would do to tell Herrick . But Heeseman will see through me , I 'm afeared . " " Very well . You tell Herrick that your outfit split over me . " " Over you  --  ? dog-gone ! That ai n't so poor . But why ? " ? " Both Slocum and Lincoln are sort of touchy about gun-throwing , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand of gunmen is  --  how he instinctively hates the real gunman . And that Slocum and Lincoln made you choose between them and me . You chose me and they rode off with their pards . " " Ahuh . Sort of so the idea will get to Heeseman 's ears that in a pinch with guns I 'd rather have you backin ' me than them ? " " Exactly . Only elaborate it . Herrick wo n't understand , so the more mysterious you make it the better . " Not long afterward Hays returned to the cabin jubilant . " You 'd never guess , Jim . That Englisher laughed like the very devil . An ' he ordered me to ride off after some desperadoes who 're not afraid of Jim Wall . " " Ha ! Ha ! But Heeseman wo n't get a laugh out of it . " " See here . Do n't fetch things to a ruction with him . " " I 'll steer clear , Hays . But if Heeseman should happen to brace me " Shoot the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tfiercely . " Wal , I 'm off for Grand . Happy , pack me a snack of grub . " " How long will it take you to ride over ? " " Eight hours , I reckon . An ' I 'll be back tomorrow night . " " Wo n't take you long , then , to make connection with your buyers ? " " Wal , I should smile not . " " Excuse my curiosity , boss , but I ca n't help wonderinghow you can establish connection so quickly , since you claim you are not a rustler . " " Thet 's my affair , Jim . But I 'll tell you , some day . " " Certainly these buyers will know you 're selling stolen cattle ? " " Oh , shore . " After Hays had gone Jim settled himself to pass the hours away . " Mebbe it wo n't be so tedious , " observed Happy Jack , dryly . " We 've got three rifles an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em cone . " Jim half expected a visit from Herrick , but the morningdragged by without any sign of anyone . About midafternoon , however , six riders appeared coming down the lane along the bench . The sight made Jim start . How often had he seen the like  --  a compact little company of riders , dark-garbed , ' riding dark horses ! It was tremendouslysuggestive to a man of his experience . " Conte here , Jack , " called Jim . " Take a squint down the road . " Happy Jack looked . " Wal , they 're comin ' shore enough . Reckon I 'd better have a peep at our supper . It might burn . " Jim reached inside the door and , drawing out his rifle , he advanced to the front of the porch , where he leaned carelessly against a post . When the group of ridersR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 75reached the point where the lane crossed the brook , just out of pistol range , they halted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge . " Hi , thar ! " he yelled , reining his horse . " Hi , yourself ! " shouted back Jim . " Is this your day fer visitors ? " " We 're at home every day and Sundays . " The man , whom , of course , Jim took to be Heeseman , walked his horse half the intervening distance and stopped again . Jim 's swift eye ascertained that the caller 's rifle-sheath was empty , a significant fact . It was still too far away to see what he looked like , but he had stature , and the figure of a man used to the saddle . At this juncture Happy Jack emerged from the cabin and carelessly propped a rifle against the wall . " Who 's callin ' ? " he boomed . " I do n't know , " replied Jim . " I 'm Bill Heeseman , an ' I come over to talk , " called the visitor . " Friendly talk ? " queried Jim . " Wal , if it ai n't you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The five men left behind over the brook puffed their cigarettes and turned dark faces to watch their leader dismount and walk unconcernedly along the path . Jim leaned his rifle against the rail and stood aside . Heeseman did not look up as he mounted the steps . He took off an old sombrero to disclose the tanned , clearskinnedface of a man under forty , with narrow blue eyes reddened by wind and dust . It was a more open visage than Jim had expected to see . Certainly Heeseman was a more prepossessing man , at first sight , than Hays . " Mind if I set down ? " he asked . " Make yourself at home , " replied Jim , and while the other sat down Jim took a less suspicious posture. 76  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S T R O B B E R S ' R O O S T  --  77 " Air you Wall ? " " Yes , that 's my name . And this is Happy Jack , another of Hays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied with a civil , " Howdy ! " and went back into the cabin . Then Heesemanleaned against the wall and treated Jim to a frank , shrewd gaze , which yet was not unmixed with steely speculation . Jim did not feel any revulsion toward the man , but he knew the cold , curious glint of that look . " You 're Hays ' right-hand man , just late from Wyomin ' ? " " Last is correct , anyhow . " " Old pards ? Hays has roamed around a good bit . " " Not so old . " " Do you know him ? " queried Heeseman , in lower voice . " Perhaps not so well as you , " replied Jim , who suddenlyreminded himself that he knew Hays but slightly . " I 'm goin ' to tell you somethin ' . " " Heeseman , you 'll only waste your breath , " declared Jim , impatiently . That was the thing to say , but he was impatient with himself . " Wal , I do n't waste much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was n't new to Utah I 'd save myself this trouble . An ' you 're goin ' to believe what I tell you . " " Why will I ? " " Because it 's true . " No argument could gainsay that ; moreover , the man had truth in his blue slits of eyes , in his voice , especially in the slight unevenness , which hinted of resentment orjustice . " Did Hays tell you I was a rustler ? " " I think he mentioned it . " " Did he tell you we was pards once ? . .. That he double-crossed me ? " " No . " " Can you swear honest thet what I say does n't make you think ? " " I could n't swear that honestly , " returned Jim , intenselyinterested despite the antagonism he had determinedupon . " Wal , I 'll let it go at thet , " returned Heeseman , coolly . " Much obliged for lettin ' me come up . An ' if you get curious , just ride over to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and walked off the porch to mount his horse , leaving Jim about as surprised as he had ever been . Happy Jack came out in time to see him join his comrades and ride back with them toward the corrals . " Short visit . Glad it was . What 'd he want ? " " Darn if I savvy , altogether . Did n't you hear any of our talk ? " " No . I reckoned the less I heard the better . Then Hank could n't razz me . But I had a hunch of what he was up to . " Jim did not press the question . He carried his rifle back into the cabin , rather ashamed of his over-haste and feeling already curious enough to call on Heeseman . Later , Happy Jack went hunting in the hope of packing in a haunch of venison . Jim had the place to himself until sunset , when the cook returned , staggering under his load . " Like shootin ' cows , " he said , depositing his load . " Got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hung up the rest . We 'll take a boss tomorrow an ' pack it down . " They had supper , after which Jack smoked and talked , while Jim listened . Evidently Happy Jack had taken a liking to him . Jim went to bed early , not because he was sleepy , but to keep from calling on that fellow , Heeseman . How many nights Jim Wall had lain down under the78 R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tdark trees to wakefulness , to the thronging thoughts that must mock the rest of any man who had strayed from the straight and narrow path ! It tormented him at certain times . But that never kept the old concentrated pondering over tomorrow from gaining control of his consciousness . Men of his type made a complexity of selfpreservation . There had been no hesitation about Hank Hays declaringhimself in regard to Heeseman . Callous , contemptuous , Hays had indicated the desirability of riddingthe range of Heeseman . But Heeseman had been subtle . Unquestionably his motive had been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , and an assertion or two , had had their effect . Jim made the reservation that he had not accepted Hays on anything but face value . Still , the robber had gradually built up a character of intent force , cunning , and strength . These had crashed , though there was no good reason for that . Jim had not accepted Hays ' word for anything . Reduced to finalities , Jim found that Heeseman 's last suggestive statement was at the bottom of the trouble . Not that Hays had been a rustler partner of Heeseman , not that he had been or was still a Mormon , but that he was not a square partner ! This stuck in Jim 's craw . Why this seemed true puzzled Jim . He knew nothing about Mormons . And now he guessed they were secretive . Heeseman had simply verified a forming but still disputedsuspicion in Jim 's mind  --  that Hank Hays had evil designs upon Herrick 's sister . Heeseman and Hays had probably known for weeks that this English girl was expected to arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim 's ? None , except that he now formed one of Hays ' band and as such had a right to question activities . Rustling cattle , R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 79at least in a moderate way , was almost a legitimate business . Ranchers back to the early days of the cattle drives from Texas had accepted their common losses . It had been only big steals that roused them to ire and action , to make outlaws out of rustlers . Nevertheless , it was extremelydoubtful , out here in the wilds of Utah , that even a wholesale steal would be agitating . To abduct a girl , however , might throw Western interest upon the perpetrators . Hays ' object assuredly was to collect ransom . In that case he would be pretty much of a hog . Still , that had not been Heeseman 's intimation , nor had it been Jim 's original suspicion . He gave it up in disgust . Time would tell . But he did not feel further inclined to call upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ensuing day passed uneventfully . No one of Smoky 's outfit showed up , nor did Hays return . Jim waited for Herrick to give him orders , which were not forthcoming . The rancher was chasing jack rabbits and coyotes with the hounds . Next morning Jim made it a point to ride over to the barns . The rancher came down in a queer costume . The red coat took Jim 's eye . A motley pack of hounds and sheep-dogs was new to Jim , as he had not seen or heard any dogs about the ranch . Jim was invited to ride along with Herrick and the several cowboys . They went by Heeseman 's camp , which was vacant . Jim was to learn that the rancher had put the Heeseman outfit to work on the cutting and peeling of logs up on the slope , preparatoyto the erection of a new barn . Jack rabbits were as thick as bees . The cowboys led the dogs , which soon became unmanageable and bolted . Then the race was on . Where the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washes Herrick did fairly well as to horsemanship , but in rough going he80 - R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tcould not keep to the English saddle . He would put his horse at anything and he ' had two falls , one pretty jarring . " Boss , shore as the Lord made little apples you 'll kill yourself with thet pancake , " said one of the long-legged cowboys , most solicitously . " You are alluding to my saddle ? " queried Herrick , standing to be brushed off . " Thet 's no saddle . It 's a pancake , " was the reply . Then ensued a most interesting argument which Herrick , despite his persistence , certainly lost . He appealed to Jim . " Mr. Herrick , in this rough country you want a cowsaddle , " replied Jim . " You see , aside from heavy cinches and stirrups , and room to tie your rope , canteen , riflesheath , saddle-bags , and slicker , or even a pack , you want something to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down steep hills . " Notwithstanding this , Herrick finished out the hunt . He was funny and queer , but he was game , and Jim liked him . On the way back Jim amused the Englishman by shooting running jack rabbits with his Colt . He managed to kill three out of five , to Herrick 's infinite astonishment and admiration . " By Jove ! I never saw such marksmanship , " he ejaculated . " That was really poor shooting . " " Indeed ! What would you call good shooting , may I ask ? " " Well , riding by a post and putting five bullets into it . Or splitting the edge of a card at twenty feet . " " Let me see your gun ? " Jim Wall broke his rule when he handed it over , butt first . R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 81Herrick looked at it with mingled feelings . " Why , there 's no trigger ! " he exclaimed , in utter astonishment . " I do not use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make the pistol go off ? " " Look here . Let me show you , " said Jim , taking the gun . " I thumb the hammer . . . like that . " " By Jove ! But please explain . " " Mr. Herrick , the cocking of a gun and pulling the trigger require twice as much time as thumbing . For example , supposing the eyesight and the draw of two men are equal , the one who thumbs his hammer will kill the other . " " Ah !  --  Er  --  Yes , I see . Most extraordinary . Your American West is quite bewildering . Is this thumbing a common practice among you desperadoes ? " " Very uncommon . So uncommon that I 'll be obliged if you will keep it to yourself . " " Oh ! Yes , by Jove ! I see . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! I grasp the point . . . . Wall , you 're a comforting fellow to have round the place . " Herrick was evidently a free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desires . His eccentricitywas not apparent , except in the fact of his presence there in wild Utah . He liked horses , dogs , guns , the outdoors , physical effort . But he had no conception whateverof his remarkable situation in this unsettled country . When they arrived at the barn he asked Jim to ride up to the house , where they would have a brandy and soda and look over some English guns . The big living-room had three windowed sides and was bizarre and strange to Jim , though attractive . Herrickhad brought with him a quantity of rugs , skins , pictures , weapons , and less easily named articles , which , along82 . R O B B E R S ' R O O S Twith Western furniture and blankets , an elk head and a bear skin , made the room unique . " I 've sworn off drinking , " said Jim , lifting his glass . " But one more , Mr. Herrick . To your good luck ! " The heavy English guns earned Jim 's solemn shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Herrick . Not even for grizzly . Get a forty-four Winchester . " " Thank you . I shall do so . I 'm fond of the chase . " Herrick had his desk near a window , and upon it , standing out in relief from books , papers , ornaments , was a framed picture of a beautiful , fair-haired , young woman . The cast of her features resembled Herrick 's . That was a portrait of his sister . Jim carried a vision of it in his mind as he rode back down the bench . He cursed the damned fool Englishman who was idiot enough to bring such a girl out to Utah . This was not Africa , where a white woman was safe among cannibals and negroes , so Jim had read . Then he cursed Hays . And lastly he cursed , not himself , but the predicament into which he had allowed himself to become inveigled . " I 'll have to stick it out , " he muttered , that fair face and shining hair before his inward eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six " T AL , I run into Smoky 's outfit over the divide , " ' Y 1 ' announced Hays , complacently . " Damme if they was n't drivin ' over ' two thousand head . " Jim had nothing to say , though there were strong queries on his lips . Hays ' plans were carrying through . The robber had a peculiar radiance . " Dumplin 's ! Dog-gone , Happy , but I 'm a hawg . Gim me some more . " " I 'll have to hoof it up to see the boss tonight , " he said , after finishing the late supper . " Put me wise to what 's come off in my absence . " " We 've had no sign of Smoky 's outfit . So we do n't know where his camp is . " " I do . It 's not more'n a mile from where I showed you the brakes of the Dirty Devil . " " Up or down ? " " Up . Back up in a canyon . Good place an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies back from Grand Junction every trip . " " Hank , reckon you 're figger'n on a long hole-up somewheres , " said Happy Jack , with a grin . " Have you run into Heeseman ? " went on Hays , ignoringJack 's hint . " Yes . He called on us , " replied Jim , casually . " What ? " " I told you , Hank . Heeseman came down to see us . " " Hell you say ! " ejaculated Hays , certainly astounded . " Tryin ' to pick a fight ? " " Not at all . I think he was curious to look me over . " " Wal ! What satisfaction did he get ? " " He 's pretty shrewd , Hank . He sized me up . If that is why he called , he got satisfaction all right . " 8384 . R O B B E R S ' R O O S T " Did he say anythin ' about me ? " demanded Hays , sullenfire lighting his eyes . " That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying . " He never mentioned you . " " Humph ! I do n't savvy that dodge . It 's no good . Heeseman is the slickest customer in Utah . Just tryin ' to scrape acquaintance , eh ? " " I think so . It struck me that he might be wanting to throw his outfit with yours . " " Ahuh . I had thet hunch . It might wal be , " replied Hays , meditatively . " Wo n't hurt for us to lay low , lettin ' him make advances . Heeseman 's a slow cuss . But he 's as sure as a rattler . " " Herrick put Heeseman 's outfit to cutting and peeling logs . He wants more horses , and a barn for them . " " Thet 's good . It 'll , keep that outfit from ridin ' down Limestone way . An ' the cowboys  --  where have they been ? " " Plenty of work around , but little riding , except after the hounds . I had a chase after jack rabbits with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next ? However , it 's not so bad . Anythin ' for us but regular ranchin ' . Haw ! Haw ! " " Herrick took me up to see his guns , " went on Jim , easily , with furtive eyes on Hays . " Have you seen them ? " " Shore . Cannons , I 'd say . Worse than the old buffalo needle-gun . " " I 'd hate to be bored by that five-hundred express , I think he called it . " " Humph ! If I got ta be bored , the bigger the bullet the better . " " That 's a beautiful living-room of Herrick 's . Have you been in there ? " " Yes . He makes that his office . Funny lot of knickknacks . There 's one thing I 'm a-goin ' to own , though . " R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 85Jim laughed . He did not need to ask any more . Suddenlythen a tigerish sensation shot through his vitals . It was like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stuff , " he said , carelessly . " Well , what 's on the cards now ? You 're back . Smoky 's outfit is on the job . Heeseman is stalled , I think , though I 'll not swear to that . " " We 'll aim to keep everybody workin ' hard around this neck of the woods . An ' we 'll pitch in ourselves . That 's all on the cards for the present . " Three days of genuine labor around the ranch , more especially in construction of the new barn , left Jim so happily tired each night that he would have liked it to go on indefinitely . Work was good . Jim could handle tools , and that soon became manifest . But on the fourth day , toward the close , Herrick approached Jim . " Wall ? I want you to go to Grand Junction tomorrow after my sister , " he said . " Take the cowboy Barnes with you . His home is in Grand Junction . Have him hitch the black team to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the following day or the next . Usually that stage gets into Grand Junction before ten o'clock . Start back at once and come speedily . " " Yes , sir , " replied Wall , resuming his work . But out of the tail of his eye he saw Hays . " Boss , I reckon I 'll go along with Wall , " he said , coolly . " Hays , I did not ask your services , " returned Herrick . " You are needed here . " His tone as much as his words settled the matter . Jim purposely delayed his hour of quitting , in order to avoid Hays . His state , not improbably , was identical with Hays ' , but Jim did not care to have the robber know that . By the time he had arrived at their cabin , however , he had himself well in hand , though still perplexed and86  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tvaguely startled that he had been chosen by Herrick . He sustained some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowing over Hays he failed to interpret what it was . Dusk was falling . The day had been warm for April . The spring frogs were shrilly peeping . Jim stopped a moment on the porch to gaze out over the darkening ranch . Cattle were lowing . This feeling he had now was evasive , but he sustained it long enough to realize regret . He liked ranch work . For years he had missed it . Sighing , he went on to the washbench . Inside the cabin Hays appeared in a brown study , but he had nothing to say upon Jim 's entrance . At Jack 's cheery call they took their seats . Hays did not eat as heartily as usual . And at table , when he took a moment to speak , he was jolly . After the meal ended he lighted his pipe , and without facing Jim he said : " Jim , had the boss mentioned this here trip before ? " " No . I was as surprised as you . " " Wal , suppose you make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " exclaimed Jim , blankly . " I could use a couple of hours in Grand Junction , " rejoinedHays . " There was one buyer I did n't see . So this offers a good chance . " " But Herrick wo n't like that , Hays , " protested Jim . " He turned down your proposal cold . " " Shore , he did . Damn funny , I take thet , too . But if you would n't or could n't go , I 'd be next choice . " " He 'd think it strange , " said Jim , sharply , trying to pierce through the back of Hays ' head . " What'n'hell do I care what Herrick thinks ? " retortedHays , losing patience . " If you 'll do what I say I 'll get to go . " " Flays , you surprise me . Here you are on the eve ofR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 87a big deal  --  the biggest of your life . And you risk angeringHerrick at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be a bad move . A mistake . For Heaven 's sake , why are you so keen on going to Grand Junction ? What for ? " " I told you , " snapped Hays , taking refuge in anger . " Hays , I refuse , " declared Jim , shortly . He must keep up his pretence of cautiousness for all their sakes , but he wanted to flash out stingingly with the truth . " Herrick ordered me to go . And I 'm going . " Hays puffed his pipe . He was beaten . And now he must save his face . Jim turned to the surprised cook . " Happy , I 'll want breakfast at daylight tomorrow . " " Any time , Jim . " Finally Hays veered around heavily , with traces of anger vanishing . " Wal , I reckon mebbe you 're right , Jim , " he said , honestly . " Only it did n't seem so . " By sunrise next day Jim Wall was on his way to Grand Junction . Young Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirited team . Frost sparkled on the sage and rocks ; the iron-shod hoofs rang on the hard road ; the swift pace engendered a stinging wind ; deer bounded ahead to disappear in the brush on the slope ; bold coyotes stood and gazed . " Are the horses gun-shy ? " asked Jim , his lips near the driver 's ear . " No . But they 're feelin ' their oats an ' I reckon you had n't better shoot yet , leastways fer nothin ' . " Jim had to wrap the robe about him , and then he felt uncomfortably cold , until a rising grade slowed down the team and the sun began to warm his back . Then he applied himself to a twofold task  --  that of winning the driver 's confidence and gaining what information was available. 88 R O B B E R S ' R O O S T He asked numberless questions about the country , in fact whatever popped into his mind . Trails , waterholes , ranchers , riders , the pass they were climbing , timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of Jim 's interest , but he did not yet touch on any other than casual things . The pass was long , of gradual ascent , and afforded little view . Once over , however , the scene ahead was superb , a great valley ending in a long red and black range . Jim kept sharp watch for a road coming in on the left . He was not greatly concerned about cattle tracks , however , because there were plenty under the wheels of the buckboard . And it was a hard , white gravel-and-lime- stone road , on which it was difficult to judge tracks . " I like the country powerful well , " said Jim , frankly . " But I 'm not so crazy about my job . " " Bet you was a cowboy once , " replied Barnes , with a grin . " You bet . And sure wish I was still . But I got to going wrong , and first thing I shot a man . . . . Heigho ! I was n't any older than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the boy , emboldened by Jim 's confidence . " Say , did n't you know why Herrick hired Hays and Heeseman ? " " All us fellers had idears . " " Well , I think Herrick wanted some hard-shooting riders as a sort of protection . " " You ai n't long in Utah . " " You 're right there . So I do n't know the ropes . " " Wal , Mr. Jim , I 'll say this . It was a good idear of Herrick 's if you fellers play square . This neck of Utah is bigger'n all outdoors , an ' it 's overrun with varmints , two-legged as wal as four-legged . " R O B B E R S ' R O O S T  --  89 " Barnes , you 've hit the thing plumb center , " replied Jim , soberly . " Thanks for speaking right out . " " Nobody much in Utah knows who 's a rustler an ' who ai n't , " went on Barnes . " Your neighbor might be one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustlin ' outfit , Thet 's the hell of it . " " How about Heeseman ? " asked Jim . " Do n't talk against your good sense , Barnes . I 'm just asking . I do n't know anything about this game up here , as you can see . And what you choose to tell me I 'll keep to myself . " " I had a hunch thet way . . . . Wal , some people says Heeseman 's outfit rustles , an ' some do n't believe it . He has a brand , H bar , an ' a range over back of Monticello . " " That 's straight talk . How about Hank Hays ? " " I 'd be up a stump if the boss asked me thet . I 'd shore have to lie . Everybody between the Green an ' the Grand knows Hank Hays , an ' what he is . But nobody ever whispers it . " " Ahuh . Darned interesting . I sort of liked Hank , first off . Rustler , then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sayin ' , Mr. Wall . " " You can call me Jim , " returned Jim , thinking it time to change the subject . " Let me drive a little . " He fell silent for a while . Curiosity might prompt him further , but he really did not need to know any more about Hank Hays . A dawning and impatient antagonism to the robber began to gain strength . It presaged events . About noon they halted at a wayside stream , and while resting the horses they ate the lunch Happy Jack had provided . Beyond this point cattle began to show on the valley floor , and green notches in the slopes across bore traces of homesteaders . Ten miles from Grand Junction , according to Jim 's informant , was the Utah Cattle Company , a big outfit from Salt Lake. 90 R O B B E R S ' R O O S TPresently Jim 's ever-watchful eyes caught dust far ahead , and dots of riders getting off the road into the cedar thickets . They would be Smoky 's outfit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckboard first . They did not appear again , and Jim knew they were hiding on their way back to Star Ranch to make another raid . The country appeared to be flattening out , greener and more cultivated in the open places , though the red cedardottedbluffs stood up here and there , and far off whitetippedmountains loomed . At four o'clock they drove into Grand Junction , which was considerably larger and busier than Green River . Like all Western hamlets , it had a single , wide street , lined by stone and frame buildings . " Barnes , here we are , " said Jim . " This is a metropolis , compared with Green River . " " Fust I 've been home fer long , " rejoined Barnes . " I 'll take care of the team at my Paw 's . An ' say , Mr. Wall  --  Jim  --  will you come home an ' stay with us or hyar at the hotel . " " Thanks , but I 'll stay here . Is this the hotel ? " " Yeh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good an ' beds clean . " " Fine . Now , Barnes , you and I are getting along . Do you give me any hunch on how to conduct myself ? " " Haw ! Haw ! Jim , you 'll be looked over a heap , but nobody wo n't ask no questions . See you later . " Barnes drove off down the road , and Jim leisurely entered the lodging-house , which , it turned out , was run by a buxom woman , who made herself agreeable and certainly was not above making eyes at him . As far as any curiosity on her part was concerned , he might as well have lived there always . She was loquacious , and very shortly Jim gained the surprising information that no cattle herds had passed through Grand Junction this week . R O B B E R S ' R O O S T - 91After supper Jim strolled out to see the town . It was still daylight . The street appeared to be practically deserted . He went down one side and up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the door locked . There was a sign , " Wells Fargo and Co. , " on the front . Evidently this town was on the stage line from Denver to Salt Lake . The big store on the corner was open , however , and Jim went in . He bought some things and incidentally corroborated Herrick 's statement as to the arrival of the stage next morning . Finally Jim wanderedinto a saloon . To his surprise it was a large place , in which fully a score of men lounged at the bar or sat around as if waiting for something . Jim fitted this atmosphere . He felt at home in it and knew he gave that impression . And he had not been in there very long before he realized that well-armed strangers were really not strangers to that place and community . There were no drinking , hair-raisingcowboys or any flashy gamblers or any drunkards . Some of those present had shifty eyes . A few were idle , tattered louts . For the most part , however , the occupants were dusty-booted men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim . He had expected just such a town . He read an old newspaper that he found , and after he had exhausted its contents , he watched a card game , but at a respectable distance with other onlookers , and passed a quiet evening without learning anything . That night he slept in a bed , the first time for so long he could not recall the last occasion , and the softness of it , or his nearing closer and closer to tomorrow 's adventure , kept him awake till late . All this while he heard a roulette wheel , but he could not tell whence the sound came . Probably there was a gambling-hall above the saloon. 92  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S TAwakening early , he got up and leisurely shaved and dressed , paying more than usual attention to his appearance . This occasioned him a bitter smile . Jim Wall , erstwhile cowboy , bank bandit , train-robber ! What was he now ? He could not define it . But he was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Star Ranch . One thing he was sure of , and that was that it would be vastly better for Miss Herrick than , if Hank Hays had been sent . Suddenly this fact struck Jim as singular . Was he any better than Hank Hays ? He concededthat he was . Still , there had never been a time since his wild cowboy days that sight of a pretty girl or a handsome woman had not made his heart leap . But for long years he had avoided women , not because he was not hungry for them , but because he seldom saw one that did not rouse his disgust . After breakfast he went out and found a boy to shine his high top-boots and brush his dark , worn suit and his black sombrero . Presently , then , he encountered Barnes . " Howdy , boy ! Did you have a nice time home ? " " Gee , I did ! " grinned the cowboy . " I was with my gurl last night an ' she would n't let me off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . " " Wal , you look kinda spick an ' span yourself , Jim , " drawled Barnes . " Funny how the idear of a gurl gets a feller . " " Funny ? You mean terrible , my friend . A woman is as terrible as an army with banners . " " Gosh ! who 'd ever dreamed you had been inside a Bible ? " exclaimed the cowboy . " It 's funny , though , how I happened to remember that . Now , Barnes , listen . This Miss Herrick might take me for an honest , decent fellow like you . But if I let thatR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 93pass I 'd be sailing under false colors . I do n't do that . And as I ca n't very well tell her myself , you must . " " Tell her what ? " queried Barnes , with a puzzled grin . " You know . . . the kind of a man I am . " " I sort of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her anythin ' you must say what . " " Well then , tell her about Herrick hiring all the desperadoesin Utah , and that I 'm one of them . Make me out worse than Hays and Heeseman thrown together . " " Shore . That 's easy . But what 's the idear , Jim ? " " I was n't always an outcast . . . . And I think it 'd hurt me less if this girl was scared and repelled . If she took me for a real Westerner , you know , and talked and laughed  --  well , I 'd go get powerfully drunk and probably shoot up Star Ranch . So you fix it for me , will you , Barnes ? " " Shore , I 'll fix it , " replied Barnes , with a sly glance at Jim . " You jest give me a chanst when the stage rolls up . She 's due now . I 'll run down an ' drive the buckboard up . But the stage did not show up for an hour  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Junction was no different from other Western points remote from civilization  --  everybody turned out to see the stage come in . It was a gala occasion for the youngsters , of whom there was a surprising number . The women onlookers , Jim observed , rather hung in the background . The four-horse stage came rolling up in a cloud of dust . The driver , a grizzled old frontiersman , brought it to a stop with a fine flourish , and he bawled out : " Grand Junction ! Half hour fer lunch . " There were six passengers , two of them feminine . The last to leave the stage was a tall , veiled young woman , her lithe and erect figure incased in a long linen coat. 94  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S T R O B B E R S ' R O O S T . 95She carried a small satchel . Expectantly she looked around . Jim stepped before her , baring his head . " Are you Miss Herrick ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your brother sent us to meet you , " went on Jim , indicatingBarnes , who stood to one side . " He did not come ! " The full , rich voice , with its foreignintonation , struck pleasantly upon Jim 's ear . " No . There 's much work at Star Ranch . But it 's perfectlyall right , Miss Herrick . We will drive you safely over before dark . " Jim could not see clearly through the tan veil , but he discerned well enough that big eyes studied him . " Did n't he send a letter or anything ? How am I to know you men are employed by my brother ? " " I 'm afraid you 'll have to take my word , " replied Jim , gravely . " But , Barnes , here , he can prove his identity . He lives in Grand Junction , and of course there are responsiblepeople who will vouch for him . " " Miss , the boss did send word , " spoke up Barnes , touching his hat , and stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told me last night you was to fetch what come by Wells Fargo . " " Then it is all right , " she replied , apparently relieved . " My luggage is inside , on top , and tied on behind . The name is on every piece . Helen Herrick . " " I 'll attend to the baggage , Miss Herrick , " rejoined Jim . " Meanwhile Barnes will show you where to eat . It might rest you to walk a little . We have an eight-hour drive . " " Thank you . I 've been riding steadily for two weeks and I 'm stiff . " Whereupon Jim set about collecting the pieces of baggagemarked " Herrick . " It appeared that the stage had been loaded down with them . Nineteen in all ! ManifestlyMiss Herrick had come to stay . To find room for all of them in the buckboard was going to be a task . He set about this methodically , his mind at once busy and absent . By packing carefully under the seats , and on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to the store and bought rope to tie some of them on securely . Wonder what she looks like , he thought ! He had felt vaguely uncomfortable when she looked him over through that veil . His task completed , Jim stood beside the restless horses , waiting . And it seemed he was waiting for he knew not what . Presently Barnes returned , wearing an excited grin . His eyes were important . " Jim , I fixed it . I shore gave her an earful , " he said . " Did you ? Much obliged , cowboy . " " She took off thet coat an ' veil . Lordy ! . . . Utah never seen the likes of her . Red lips , pink cheeks , hair like gold , an ' eyes like violets ! Jim , for a minnit I went plumb back on my gurl ! But , shucks ! thet 's crazy ! She asked me to set at table . I did . She 's just as nice an ' free as Herrick . It was while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her about the nootorious Jim Wall . Mebbe I did n't spread it on . An ' she looked  --  Gee ! such eyes ! She said , So Bernie Herrick sent a desperado to be my escort ? How perfectly rippin ' ! ' Honest , Jim , thet 's what she said . So I shet up pronto . . . . When I jest come away she said she 'd walk a little in the orchard an ' after goin ' into the Wells Fargo office she 'd be ready . " " Have you double-crossed me ? " queried Jim , suspicious of this boy . " You were to make me out low-down . " " Jim , honest to Gawd , if thet gurl ai n't scared to death of you she 's a new one on me , " declared Barnes . But there was fun and evasion in his keen hazel eyes . Somehowhe had failed to follow instructions . " I 'll go in the Chink 's here and get a bite to eat . You watch the horses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O O S TUpon his return Jim espied Miss Herrick emerging from the yard of Mrs. Bowe 's lodging-house . She carried the linen coat on her arm , and without it did not appear so tall . She had a wonderful step , a free , swinging , gracefulstride , expressive of health and vitality . She did not look slender , as in the long ulster , but superb , broad of shoulder . She wore a half-length coat over her brown dress . It had a collar of dark fur which presented vivid contrast to her exquisite complexion . The veil was tucked back and now permitted sight of a wave of shining golden hair . At a little distance her eyes looked like great , dark holes set in white . But as she approached Jim saw they were violet in hue , warm , beautiful , fearless . " Are we ready to go ? " she asked , gayly . " Yes , if you have seen the Fargo people , " replied Jim . " I have it in my satchel , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim tried to interest himself in that satchel because he was in league with robbers , but it did not work . Suddenly he had a murderous desire to kill Hays . This girl  --  for she appeared a girl in vivid freshness of youth  --  seemed not in the least frightened , absolutely free from revulsion . Indeed , she was regarding him with undisguised interest and delight . " Mr. Jim Wall , you 're not in the least what my brother 's letters have led me to believe , " she said . " Letters ! Why , Herrick has not had time to write about me , " exclaimed Jim , incredulously . " It takes long for a stage letter to go . . . . I 've been at Star Ranch only a few days . " " Oh , he did not write about you , individually , " shelaughed . " But from his letters about bandits and desperadoesI had , evolved a rather frightful conception . " " Thank you , Miss Herrick , " he replied , gravely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O S T - 97trust appearances on our Western border . . . . Will you get up ? We must be going . " And he attempted to assist her inside the back seat of the buckboard . " If you are going to drive , I want to sit in front , " she said , frankly . With a bow he helped her up the high step , cursing inwardlyat Hank Hays and Herrick and the inscrutable fate that had brought this about . For some way or other he was lost . He almost forgot to wait for ' Barnes , who was saying good-by to a red-cheeked , wide-eyed girl in the crowd . Barnes came running to leap into the buckboard , and then Jim got in . Owing to the way he had packed the baggage , there was not a great deal of room in the front seat . His heavy gun and sheath bumped against Miss Herrick . " Rather tight quarters , with that gun there , " he remarked , and swung the sheath round in his lap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quizzically . " Yes . And never am dressed in the daytime till it 's buckled on . " " What startling folk , you Western Americans ! " " Some of us are indeed startling . I hope you wo n't find us unpleasantly so , " he replied and , loosening the reins , let the spirited team go . In a few moments the noise , dust , heat , and the staring populace of Grand Junction were far behind , and the red and black ranges lifted above the meadows and sage . " Oh , glorious ! " she cried , and gazed raptly ahead as the curving road brought into view a wonderful sweep of Utah . Jim was hard put to it to keep the blacks from breaking out of a brisk trot . He thought grimly that he would have liked to let the team run off and kill them both . Far better that might be ! Miss Herrick 's photograph on her98 R O B B E R S ' R O O S T R O B B E R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell infinitely short of doing her justice . It failed to give any hint of her color , of the vivid lips , of the glory and gleam of her hair , of the dancing , laughingviolet eyes , of her pulsing vitality . Jim Wall felt the abundant life of this girl . It flowed out of her . It got into his veins . It heated his blood . " The wind makes me cry , " she said , merrily . " Or maybe it 's because I 'm so happy . You say we 'll get to Star Ranch before dark ? " " Surely . " " Oh , it 's been such along , slow , dusty , cramped journey , " she exclaimed . " But now I want to see , to smell , to feel , to gloat . " " Miss Herrick , this is fine country . But tame compared with that all about the Henrys . You will see them when we top the next hill . I 've seen most of the West . And the canyon desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the West , probably of the whole world . " " Indeed ! You speak strongly , not to say surprisingly . It never occurred to me that a gunman  --  that is what you are , is it not ?  --  could have any appreciation of the wonder and beauty of nature . " " A common mistake , Miss Herrick , " rejoined Jim . " Nature develops the men who spend their lonely , hard , bloody lives with her . Mostly she makes them into boasts , with self-preservation the only instinct , but it is conceivablethat one now and then might develop the opposite way . " " You interest me , " she replied , simply . " Tell me of this canyon desert and such men . " Jim talked for a full hour , inspired by her unflagging interest . He described the magnificent reaches and escarpmentsending in Wild Horse Mesa , and the unknowncanyoned abyss between it and Navajo Mountain , and lastly the weird , ghastly brakes of the Dirty Devil . " Ugh ! how you make me shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sick of people , of fog , rain , dirt , cold , noise . I 'd like to get lost down in those red canyons . " Chapter SevenTHEY came to a long level valley where the ' white THEY was like a floor , and the horses went like the wind . Wall 's letting them out was unconscious : it was a release of his vagrant and startling imagination. liens the English lady could not catch breath enough to talk . The tan veil was flying and so were some strands of her hair . Site appeared to be a beautiful thing of porcelainand gold , animated by throbbing life . What was going to be the effect of this extraordinary female upon the fierce turn of this lonely region ? Upon that swarthy I lank I lays ! ( lncr in a long time , perhaps , his pale eyes alighted upon a fresh , red-checked , buxom girl , bttt for the most part , lint knew , f lays never saw any but flat-chested , lanky limbed , big-footed , and hardhandedwonuun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shin dried in the  --  wind . They wore overalls and boots , as often as feminine garments , and they were alwaysmarried. ' tab was still so wild and unsettled that the hags and camp-followers common to Wyoming had not arrived . At last the horses had to be held in at the base of the longest ascent on the  --  journey . Miss I ierrick tucked her disheveled hair with the ends of the veil under her bonnet . " What a run ! I 'm used to horses- 1 nt not tearing along  --  with a vehicle like this , " she said , breathlessly . " Wait till one of these old dr ivers get a chance at you . I 'm really no teamster . " Arc you a cowboy ? " " I used to he . And I still rifle after cattle occasionally . But now I 'm only a  --  a range-rider . " " What 's the difference ? " " Well , a range-rider just travels from camp to camp . " " It must be a wonderful life . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E R S ' R O O S " I ' 101been among the gypsies in Spain . But that can scarcely be the nature of your position on my brother 's ranch . " " Did n't young Barnes tell you who and what 1 am ? " queried Jim , turning to her . " He talked like  --  like that babbling brook we just passed , " returned the lady , with a musical laugh . " Mitch of it was Greek to me . But I grasped that you were a stranger to Utah  --  that you were from Wyoming , where you had killed many bad men , and that your mere reputationwas enough out here to keep rustlers and desperadoes away from Star Ranch . Mr. Wall , you certainly are a hero in his eyes . " It did not take great perspicuity to grasp that Jim was not far from that in her eyes . He groaned in spirit . " Miss Herrick , this young fellow is an awful liar , " said Jim . " How so ? He seemed very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest eyes . I do n't know Westerners , as they call you folk , but what of that ? " " You are in for a terrible disillusion . " " Mr. Wall , you can not quell my enthusiasm . I know I am going to love this wild , glorious country . I 've lived in London most of my life . I got to hate the crowded streets , the mud , the clamor , the dark , cold rooms where you had to have a light at midday , and the endless , everhurryingthrongs of people . There 's a strain of primitive blood in me . One of my ancestors was a viking . I think another must have been an American Indian . " Here her rich laughter rang out . " At any rate , I am going to indulgemy wild strain . The red gods have always whispered to me . Even as a child I knew I was intended for something big , strange , extraordinary . " " I hardly understand you , Miss Herrick , " returned Jim , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open . I had some schooling , and I taught102  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S Ta country school before I was twenty . But I never saw anyone like you . So if I appear ignorant , please excuse it . " " On the contrary , Mr. Wall , you have impressed me as far above the average Westerner , " the girl returned , kindly , but without a trace of condescension . " I 've met numberless people on the way out . Pioneers , farmers , ranchers , drivers , cowboys , and a good few that I could n't place or learn from . But I talked with all of them . You certainly do not need to apologize for yourself . . . . And you have been a school-teacher ! That is something that I would never have attributed to you . And what else have you been ? " On the moment Jim was too stricken to take advantage of the opportunity to repel her once and for all . The astounding idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " A little of everything  --  Western I guess , " he floundered . He felt her gaze . " I see that you will not tell me about yourself , " she went on . " Pardon my inquisitiveness . But I must inform you that I expect to go into the ranching business with my brother . You will be working for me , then , as well . " " I hope you do n't , Miss Herrick , " he burst out , impulsively . " Somebody must tell you . It ought n't come from a  --  a  --  rider like me . But this Utah is no place for such a girl as you . " " What do you mean , Mr. Wall ? That hardly seems a compliment to me . I can work , and I want to . I shall adore this wild country . I tried to explain why . I can milk cows , bake bread , take care of horses . It does n't follow just because I have money that I do not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my meaning , " replied Jim , hastily , with strong feeling . " It is not you who could n't fit in . You 've convinced me you could . And that is the biggest compliment I could pay you . . . . I meantR O B B E R S ' R O O S T  --  103that you will not be able to live , and work , too , in Utah the way you want to . You absolutely can not indulge that primitive strain you spoke of  --  not out here . You dare not ride around  --  or even leave the house . Even that " For mercy 's sake , why not ? " she demanded , in astonishment . " Because , young woman , you are too new , too strange , too lovely to risk yourself in sight of these Utah men . . . . Not all of them , nor a tenth of them . But some of them . And they are the men you would meet at Star Ranch . " His sudden intensity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her realize his sincerity , and that there was something amiss which her brother had failed to tell her . " You can not be serious . " " I swear it , Miss Herrick . " " But what of the vaunted chivalry of Westerners ? England rings with the daring , the gallantry , of Americanson the frontier . I 've read of Fremont , Kit Carson , Crook , and many others . And of the thousands who are unsung . " " That is true , " he replied , his voice husky . " Thank God , I can say so . But you wo n't find that at Star Ranch . " " You say I am too new , strange  --  too , too lovely to risk  --  I understand you , of course . I must doubt it , despiteyour evident strong feeling . You may be playing a Western joke on me . " " I wish I was . " " My brother will know if there is anything in what you say . " " No ! No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of patience with her and himself . What possessed him to talk this way ? " Herrick does n't know . He never104 . R O B B E R S '  --  R O O S Twill know . He is English . He ca n't see through a millstonewith a hole in it .  --  Oh , do n't misunderstand me . Herrick is a fine chap , generous , friendly , not the least stuck-up . Put Utah is no place for an English gentleman and sportsman , any more than it is a fit place for his sister . " " That is for us to decide , " she returned , coldly . " It is less disturbing than what you say against me having my fling . I shall ride , anywhere and everywhere . I 've always ridden . I 'd go mad not to get on a horse in this glorious country . " " I 've done my best . I 've told you , " he said , curtly , as if he were also addressing his conscience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , quick to catch the change in him . " No doubt you Western folk regard Bernie as eccentric . And I 'm bound to admit his ranching idea  --  ripping as it is to us  --  must appear new and strange to you . So I 'll compromise . If it 's really dangerous for me to ride about alone , I will take you with me . Not , however , that I 'd be afraid to go alone . Then I would be perfectly safe , would I not ? " Wall flicked the reins . " Look , Miss Herrick . We 're on top at last . There 's your country . The black snow-capped mountains are the Henrys . We go through that gap  --  a pass  --  to Star Ranch . That purple space to the left  --  with the lines and streaks  --  that 's the desert . Magnify its everything by ten thou-sand . " " Ab-h-1i ! " she had cried out , breathlessly . Jim halted the horses and gazed himself , trying to see with this stranger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amply eloquent . But he got no satisfaction out of his own gazing . He had an instinctive desire to get on a horse and ride off alone into this wilderness . He had more  --  a presagement that it would not be long until theR O B B E R S ' . R O O S T  --  105open wasteland claimed him again . For him the bursting of one of the Henry peaks in volcanic eruption would be no more startling than what would accrue from the advent of this white-faced , golden-haired woman . Jim anticipated , presently , an outburst from Miss Herrick , but it was not forthcoming . He drove down the hill , and again put the blacks to keen gait on a level road , this time a straight white line across a longer valley . The warm sun had begun its descent from the zenith . Jim calculated that he would beat the time he had declared , and reach Star Ranch before sundown . Only one more hill to climb and that the Pass , which was comparativelyshort on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisterof Bernie Herrick had an unaccountable effect upon Jim . Bernie ! The name suited Herrick , as that of Helen suited this girl . It was a fatal name for a pearly-skinned , blue-eyed , golden-haired beauty . Vague legend stirred in Jim Wall 's memory . Fast as he drove , it was yet not fast enough to escape from himself . Then when the wind tore off Miss Herrick'sbonnet , he had to stop the iron-jawed blacks  --  no slight task  --  and get out and walk back . But the change seemed to soothe him somehow . He strode back with the flimsy headgear . Far from prepared was he , however , for sight of Miss Herrick bareheaded . " Thank you , " she said . " Too bad to make you get out and walk . But you drove so terribly fast . It 's a wonder my clothes did n't follow my hat . " Jim made a light reply , he knew not what . To him the wonder was  --  flashing like a flame from the darkness of his mind  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drive down into the wilderness , never to let the gaze of another man rest upon this destroying woman . In an hour more he had crossed the valley and again addressed a slope , where the slow gait of the horses gave106  --  R O B B E R S ' . R O O S TMiss Herrick further opportunity to talk . He both dreaded and longed to hear that rich voice , so different from the few women 's voices he recalled . But she surprised him again , this time by silence . She had been overpoweringly struck by the two hours ' riding toward that gorgeous region of color and upheaval . Not until they got to the top of the Pass , when Jim pointed clown the Star Ranch Valley , did she awaken out of her trance . Then during the hour and a half it took to reach the ranch Jim answeredqueries and explained what this and that was which caught her eye . Such wholly objective conversation was easy for Jim , and the time flew by . When he drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper . The road passed within fifty feet of their chuck-wagon . " What a ruffianly crew ! " murmured Miss Herrick . " Who , pray , are these men ? " " Part of the outfit your brother hired to protect his cattle from rustlers , " replied Jim . " Funny thing about that is they are rustlers themselves . " " Deliciously funny , though hardly so for Bernie . Doeshe know it ? " " Not to my knowledge . Heeseman  --  the leader of that gang  --  came on his own recommendation and got thejob . " " I 'll have the fun of telling Bernie . . . . Oh , what 's that ? . . . What an enormous barn ! All yellow . And a new one going up . Logs and logs . . . . Look at the horses ! I want to stop . " " No , Miss Herrick , " he replied , grimly . " I 'll drive you home safely or die in the attempt . . . . Do n't look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked , laughingly . " The one standing fartherest out , " replied Jim . " He'sR O B B E R S ' R O O S T  --  107got on a black sombrero . . . . Do n't look at him . That 's hank Hays . . . . Miss Herrick , drop your veil . " She obeyed , unobtrusively , though her silvery laugh pealed out . " You are teasing , of course . But I must rewardyour effort to entertain me . " Jim drove by Hays , who stood apart from a group of cowboys . He had the stiff , alert posture of a watching jack rabbit that imagined itself unseen . If he noticed Jim at all , it was totally oblivious to Jim . But Wall 's glance , never so strained , pierced the shadow under Hays ' dark sombrero rim to the strange eyes below . They were not pale now . Jim 's hand clenched tight on the reins . He became preoccupied with the nucleus of the first deadly thought toward Hays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Herrick was saying . " Another of your brother 's vigilantes . " " Uh !  --  How he stared ! But it was n't that which struck me most . In India I 've seen cobras rise and poise , ready to strike . And your Mr. Hays looked for all the world like a giant ring cobra with a black sombrero on its head . Was n't that silly of me ? " " Not silly . An instinct . Self-preservation , " returned Jim , sternly . She passed that by , but only perhaps because she caught sight of the ranch-house up the slope . Here her enthusiasm was unbounded . Herrick stood on the porch steps with his dogs . He wore high boots and a red coat . He waved . Presently Jim reined in the sweating horses before the steps . He was most curious to see the meeting between brother and sister . She stood up . " Bernie , old top , here I am , " she said , gaily . " Yes , here you are , Helen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alight . " Did you have a nice trip ? " " Ripping  --  from Grand Junction in. " 108 R O B B E R S ' R O O S TThey did not embrace or even shake hands . Jim decided that when it came to intimate feelings , these Englisheither did not have them or else they hid them . Jim , coming to himself , leaped out and began removing the bags . Barnes , whom he had totally forgotten , jumpedout on the other side . " Barnes , carry the bags in . Jim , hurry the blacksdown . They 're hot . You must have pushed them . " " Yes , sir . Stage was late , but we made up for it . " " Helen , where 's that Wells Fargo package ? " queriedHerrick . " Here in my satchel. ( ) h , Bernie , it 's good to get home  --  if this can be hone . " " Come in and take off that veil , " he said , and withhis arm in hers led her upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he crossed thebench and made his way down the steel ) , rocky declivity to 1 lays ' cabin . 1 hippy Jack was whistling about the fire , knocking pans and otherwise indicating the proximity ofsupper . " Howdy , Jack ! What 's tricks for today ? " asked Jim . " Glad you 're back , Jim , " declared the cook , cordially . " Anyone 'd have thank you was goin ' to dish the outfitjudgin ' from Hays . I lc 's been like a hound on a leash . Smoky rode in today full of ginger , news an ' a roll of long green that 'd have choked a cow . But even thetdid n't ease the boss . " " What ailed him , Jack ? " inquired Jim , not withoutimpatience . " Dinged if I know . It had to do with your goin ' toGrand , a darned sight more than Smoky 's . " Heavy footfalls outside attested to the return of Hays . Without more comment Jim stood up and away from the table , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hays of other days , yet it was hard to define the change , u n -R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 109less it consisted in a gloomy , restless force behind his stride . Smoky followed him in , agreeable by contrast . " Hullo ! Here you air . I waited at the barn , " said Hays , gruffly . " Howdy , boss ! I took a short cut down , " replied Jim , with a nod to Smoky . " I seen Barnes an ' had a word with him . So your trip come off all right ? You shore made them blacks step . " " It was n't as pleasant a drive as you 'd imagine , " returnedJim , darkly . " Haw !  --  You must be one of them woman-haters . . Outside of thet side of it , what happened to jar you ? " " Nothing to concern you or your outfit . Smoky saw me yesterday before I got a line on him . He ducked offthe road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd expect . " " Ahuh . Thet 's good , " replied Hays , and going over tothe pack beside his bed he rummaged about to return with a packet , which he slapped down upon the table . " There you air , Jim . On our first deal . " The packet unrolled and spread out  --  greenbacks of large denomination . " What 's this for ? " queried Jim , blankly . " Quick action . Thet 's how we work . Your share . Smoky fetched it . " Jim did not care to give the impression that he was unusedto this sort of thing . Straddling the bench , he sat down to run through the bills . " Five thousand six hundred , " he said , as if to himself , and he slipped the money inside his pocket . " Muchobliged , Smoky . Now I 'll be able to sit in in a little game of draw . " " Jim , ai n't you got any news atall ? " inquired Hays , searchingly . " A feller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethin ' . " 110 . R O B B E R S ' R O O S T " Miss Herrick fetched a Wells Fargo package to her brother , " rejoined Jim , slowly yielding to what he felt was due himself as an ally of this robber . " Then it 's come , " said Hays , cracking his hands . " Herrickwas expectin ' money last stage . " " Yes , " returned Jim , indifferently . " Boys , set down an ' fall in , " called out Happy Jack . As usual , supper was not a conversational matter . Hays ' outfit always ate as if they were facing starvation . It was a habit of riders , engendered by the fact of being always on the move . After supper Smoky was the first to break silence . " Boss , now Wall is back , you can make up your mind about what I 'd like to do . " " Jim , listen to this . Smoky an ' the other fellers , exceptBrad , want to nuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? " " ( ' lean I Icrrick out ? " asked Jim . " Thet 's the idce . " Jim pondered a moment . his mind answered that in a flash , but he considered it wise not to be precipitous . " It 'd be harder work , hut save time , and perhaps our bacon as well . These cowboys are going to find out pretty soon that the cattle have thinned out . If Smoky drives a couple thousand more it 'll be sure to be found out , sooner or later . " " See thar , boss . Wall see 's it just as I do . There 's plenty of water along the road an ' feed enough . Let 's make it one big drive . " " Meanin ' for me an ' Jim an ' IIappy to fall in with you ? " queried Hays , tersely . " Shore , onless you think thet ai n't so good . " " Wal , it 'd mean leavin ' Star Ranch sudden , " cogitated the robber chief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 111 " But I do n't want to pull out of here sodden , " declared Hays . " Why not , if we git away with ten thousand head ? " queried Smoky , astounded . " Thet ten thousand wo n't close the deal I 'm on . " " What 've you up your sleeve , Hank ? " " Thet 's my business . Yours is drivin ' cattle . " " You mean to rob the Englisher ? Fer Gawd 's sake , Hank , do n't be a hawg ! " " Hays , if you 'll excuse me I 'm thinking Smoky talks sense , " interposed Jim , quietly . " Wal , I 'm listenin ' , but I reckon you ca n't change me , " returned Hays . " If we put it to a vote , Hank , you would n't be nowhere . I do n't want to buck ag'in ' you . But you 're way off on this . . . .

An ' now Jim Wall backs us up . " Hays knocked the bowl of his unsmoked pipe on the table , and he arose , gaunt and virile , to stalk up and down the room , plainly a victim of conflicting tides of feeling . But indecision did not last long . His gesture , abrupt and passionate , not only indicated the men who opposed him , but infinitely more . " My mind 's made up . We 'll stick to our first idee . You fellers make drive after drive , goin ' slow . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you 'll risk goin ' ag'in ' the whole outfit , " interrupted Smoky , with a curious gaze at his superior. 112 R O B B E R S ' R O O S T " Wal , hell , yes , if you put it thet way , " replied Hays , and he stalked out . " No help fer it , men , " said Smoky , presently . " Somethin'sgot into the boss . Reckon I 'll hit the trail fer camp . Did n't intend to leave till nuornin ' . But it 's jest as well . Jim , do n't you want to come along ? " " I 'd like to , at that . But how 'd I lays take it ? " " He 'd swear you was double-crossin ' him . I hope to Gawd he does n't do the clotil , le-crossin ' . " " Smoky , will you start that second drive tomorrow ? " asked Wall . " I 'll lay it tip to my outfit . Wal , so long . See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Jim heard a few sharp words pass betweenSmoky and ! lays , and then silence . Happy Jack looked at Jim , shaking his head dubiously . Jim waited awhile , hoping that I lays would return , but as he did not , Jim went to bed . For once he hated to be alone in the dark and quiet . In his inmost heart he realized that he was tremendously upset by the advent of this Herrick girl . Next day he went back to work on the new barn . A subtle change in Hank l lays augmented his suspicion of that individual . Jim let him alone . IIe did not require much more to satisfy himself about Hank Hays . While Jim worked with the cowboys he watched , and he had the eyes of a hawk . I lerrick was around as usual , interested in every detail of the building . Hays had gone off with the cowboys across the valley to put them upon some job there , which no doubt was a ruse to keep them away from Limestone Springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see Hays until supper . And the day had ended without one glimpse of Helen Herrick . Jim measured the incredible fact of his desire to see her byR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 113the poignancy of his disappointment . Then he cursed himself for a fool . His mood changed as subtly as had Hays ' , with the result that he and the moody leader made poor company . This night Jim deliberately set himself to study the robber near at hand and to watch him from a distance . At table and round the fire Hays apparently made some effort to be his former self . But the effort betrayed constraint . And out in the dark , when Hays imagined no one saw his actions , he seemed a hounded man . What was on his mind ? What further plot was he hatching ? Could it be possible that intent to rob Herrick of money , and any valuables procurable , could obsess him to this extent ? After all , Jim did not know Hays well . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At breakfast the following morning Hays surprised Jim . " Was the Herrick girl out yesterday ? " he inquired . " Did n't see her , " replied Jim , setting down his cup . " You did n't say what kind of a looker she was . An ' the other night she had her face hid by some contraption . Might as wal wore a mask . I seen her hair , though . Like sunflower ! An ' she shore has a shape . " " Oh , that ! " laughed Jim . " I forgot or did n't think you were interested . She 's a washed-out , pink-and-white thing . No blood . Consumptive or anemic , I reckon . " " Consumptive ! With thet breast ? " rejoined Hays , scornfully . " Wal , I 'd like to see her once before our deal 's off here . " " Are you thinking better of Smoky 's idea ? " " Not of thet . But I 'm worryin ' about him . " Hays had his wish fulfilled next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the far side from where Jim was occupied , when Miss Herrick came clown with her brother . Jim stared as if his eyes deceived him . An English riding-114 R O B B E R S ' R 0 0 S T R 0 I3 13 E R S ' R O O S T 115habit was known to him only from pictures . She looked queenly . Jim slid not look at her face . Besides , he wanted most to see the effect upon Hank Hays . That worthy 's hawk-like head was erect , but Jim could not see the tell-talc eyes . Hays stood transfixed , then suddenly , in strange gesture , as of finality , he flung down the tool he had been using . Was that his satisfaction at having seen this wonderful girl ? Was it hail and farewell to such beauty as might once only come under the gaze of a man of his class ? Most certainly it was repudiation of something . Herrick and his sister walked toward Jim 's side of the barn . They talked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewitched . " I'licn she approached . " Good morning , " she said . " So you are a carpenter as well as a vigil:onte ? " Jin ) doffed his sombrero and stood up straight . His gun struck the scantling with a perceptible little thud . She could not help noticing that and it gave her pause . " I 'm not at my best with this kind of a hammer , " repliedJim , with a smile , after greeting them . " Apropos of that , I Bernie told me how you shoot bob  --  no , jack rabbits from the saddle , " she said , admiringly . " I want to see you do that . And T want to learn how . Will you show me ? " " I 'd be pleased , Miss Ilerrick , " he returned . " But I ca n't guarantee you 'll hit any of them . " " I may surprise you . Tomorrow , then , you will ride with me ? " " I 'm at your service , " replied Jim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll oblige me by riding with my sister when it suits her , " said Herrick . " By Jove ! I ca n't live on the back of a horse , and I do n't want her to ride alone . " " Yes , sir , " returned Jim , gazing across at the statuelikeTlays . The couple moved off toward the open yard where mounted cowboys were leading out saddled horses . PresentlyJim heard them ride away with the barking dogs . He looked up , however , when Hays accosted him , at his elbow . " I seen her , Jim , " he said , as if the event were epic . " She walked right by me . I smelled her . " " Oh , hello ! You startled me , " replied Jim , essaying a laugh . " What if you did , Hank ? " " Nothin ' . Only you gave me a wrong idee . Pink-an ' - white washed-out thing , you said . My Gawd ! " " Hank , I 've no use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deception . " Hell ! you need n't bite my head off , " said Hays . " I 'll bet you have n't any use fer any color women . . . . What was she sayin ' to you ? " " It seems Herrick told her about my shooting jacks from my horse , and she wants to see it done . " " Wal , I 'll be jiggered ! You 're goin ' ridin ' with her ? . . . The luck of some men ! " " Hank , I 'd a darn sight rather they 'd asked you , " declaredJim , and then a keen idea struck him , which would , if Hays was not wary , clear up a knotty question . " Shall I tell Herrick you 'll go in my stead ? " " Nix , much as I 'd like to . I ca n't hit jumpin ' rabbits . An ' I would n't want to be showed up bad . " " Like as not I 'll be rattled and miss a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought in them might be read . Then he went back to work . Hays hung around the barn , mostly idle , watching the valley , until the Herricks returned to ride up the hill toward the house . The cowboysbrought the horses down . Whereupon Hays abruptly left . And he did not come back . From that hour he be-116 R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tcame an elusive man . Jim , preoccupied with his own troubles , barely noticed this circumstance until that night . That day ended Jim Wall 's carpentry . On the next he was summoned , early after break fast , to ride with the Herricks . Ile went . And it would have been idle for him to deny that the event was enthralling . These English people were thoroughhred . Not improbably , in their minds unconsciously , the abyss between tlrcni and him was so wide and deep , that it was not thought of at all . That accounted for things . Ile divined vaguely , however , that for him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this girl 's inspiring presence Jim gave an exhibition of swift and accurate shooting that surpassed any he had ever accomplished . " Marvelous ! " she exclaimed , with dark-flashing , admiringeyes on liar . " It would be suicide for men to opposeyou. . . . ! hit poor little jack rabbits ! What a pity they arc destructive around the ranch ! " , " I Men , he 's a bully good shot , " declared Herrick . That night flank I lays evinced slight but unmistakable symptoms of jealousy , occasioned , perhaps , by Jim 's reportof killing thirteen out of fifteen bounding jack rabbits . Happy Jack , wide-eyed and loud-voiced , acclaimed Jim 's feat as one in a thousand . " Air you thet good frontin ' a man who you know is swift ? " drawled the robber chief . Jim stared , coming out of his natural gratification . " I-lank , I 'm not so good then , " he replied , slowly . " Wal , somebody 'll try you out one of these days , " added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he rejoined , coolly , and sought his seclusion . He refused to let that linger in his mind . Somethingelse haunted him . His slumber was troubled . Next day Herrick did not accompany his sister on theR O B B E R S '  --  R O O S T  --  117daily ride , a circumstance which , if anything , gave freer rein to her spirit . Jim had concern for her safety . He could not judge well of her horsewomanship , because of the side-saddle she rode . Bluntly he disapproved of the atrociousthing and said it was worse than the " pancake " her brother rode . But she rode after the hounds just the same , and held her own until she was thrown . If she had alighted upon rocks or even hard ground she would have been seriously injured , if not killed outright . But when the horse stumbled she hurtled over his head and hit in the sand . Jim was off almost the instant she struck , and he yelled for the cowboys . Kneeling , he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been stunned . Her face was gray with sand . " Water , Barnes ! " he called , as the cowboy dashed up . " There ai n't none close , " replied Barnes . " I 'm all  --  right , " spoke up Miss Herrick , weakly . " I came  --  a cropper  --  did n't I ? " She sat up , evidently not hurt , though she clung to Jim 's arm . With his scarf he wiped the sand from her face , aware that his hand was not steady . If he had had to rely upon a gun then ! The stiff hat she wore with this riding-habit had rolled yards away . Barnes got it . Her hair had come partly loose , to fall in a golden mass on her shoulder . She rearranged it and put on her hat , deftly despite gloved fingers . " Help me up , please , " she said . Jim placed a strong arm under hers and lifted her to her feet . She appeared able to stand alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " Deuced clumsy of me , " she said , flexing her right knee . " Miss Herrick , are you sure you 're not hurt ? " asked Jim , solicitously . " It was a nasty spill . " 118 R O B B E R S ' R O O S T " I 'm not really hurt , " and letting go of Jim she essayeda few steps to prove it . Then something cold and tight within Jim let go , andhis reaction was to take refuge in anger . " Miss Herrick , I told you that saddle was no good . It 's a wonder youwere not killed . " " Oh , do n't exaggerate . I 've come many croppers crosscountryriding at home . " " Barnes , back me up iii this , " appealed Jim to the cowboy . " Miss , he 's tellin ' you true , " said Barnes , earnestly . " You was ridin ' fast . I t this hyar had been stony ground , like it is lots of places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I believe I did strike pretty hard , " she admitted , ruefully . " You want a cow-saddle with a double cinch , andoveralls , " concluded l int . " Overalls ! " she exclaimed , and she blushed rosy red . " You mean like these blue  --  trousers Barnes has on ? " " Yes . " Then you can ride . This is the West , Miss Herrick . You like to run a horse . It 's dangerous . I shallhave to speak to your brother . " " Do n't . I 've never ridden astride , but I 'll do it , sinceyou are so very fearful about me . . . . Please help meup . That experience left Jim shaky , probably a good dealshakier than it had left Miss I lerrick . But it was not fear for her . Jim reveled in the torturing sensations engenderedby contact with this beautiful girl . He shook like a leaf at the staggering realization that when she lay on the ground with her arms spread wide , her hair gold against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast . A natural impulse , under the circumstances , but for him  --  idiotic ! Hays was not present that night at supper . This omissionin no wise concerned Jim . He was too preoccupiedR O B B E R S ' . R O O S T . 119to care or think about the chief . Days passed by , heady or blank , according to whether or not he rode with Miss Herrick . She took to the Western saddle like a duck to water . She could ride . Moreover , that spirit of which she had hinted certainly overtook her . More than once she ran off alone , riding like the wind , and upon one of these occasions it took the cowboys till dark to find her . That with Hank Hays and Heeseman there to see her gallop away unescorted ! I-Ierrick did not seem to mind . As far as Jim Wall was concerned , however , these rides with her centered him upon the love which had come to consume him ; and the several she took alone were more torturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ascertained whether or not Hays followed her , but when the day came that Jim discovered Hays had been riding the trails frequented by Miss Herrick , then it seemed time to act . This placed Jim in a worse quandary . To act , for a man of his training , at such a time and place , was to do only one thing . But how could he kill his leader upon mere suspicion of sinister intent to kidnap the girl ? It was a damnable predicament for a man who had always played fair , alike to honest friend and crooked ally . Jim paced under his dark sheltering trees , in the dead of night , when he should have been sleeping . Days had passed without his once seeking to avoid disaster ; and he had not sought because he knew it was of no use . To wish to be with this blond girl seemed irresistible . More than once he had caught himself in the spell of a daring impulse  --  to tell Miss Herrick that he loved her . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he tried to shake it the result was it grew stronger in a haunting , maddening way . His manhood cast this aside . The love of the male , 120 R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tespecially a lonely one of the wilds , expressed itself in many thoughts that Jim realized were the heritage of barbarism . They occurred in strange , vague , distorted dreams . They were strong in a man in whom the primitiveinstincts prevailed . But seldom did they gain ascendency . Jim remembered his mother and sister ; and then he thrust away from him any possibility of distress coming to this Herrick girl from him . That was how he met temptation . Then he was to be confronted by the fact that making love to her was insignificantto what Ilank hays might do . Whereupon the battle was fought all over again . He won as before , though with dark doubts in his mind . What could come of this tangled circumstance but disaster ? At breakfast next morning Hays raved about the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Things air comin ' to a head , " he concluded , gloomily . " Reckon they ought to have made two drives by now , " rejoined Happy Jack . " I rid down the valley yestiddy eight or ten miles . Cattle thinned out , boss . Any cowboy with eyes in the back of his head would be on to us by now. , , " Shore . Have n't I kept them workin ' up here ? But I 've no control over this hossback-ridin ' after hounds . Pretty soon Herrick will be chasin ' down Limestone way . Then the fire 'll be out . " " Hank , he would n't know the difference , " interposed Jim . " Aw , I do n't give a damn , " replied Hays , harshly , and that finality intimated much . " Wait till Smoky 's outfitshows up ! " Every morning when Jim rode down to the corrals he fell back under the spell of something sweeter than wine . The sunny hours with the sage flat ahead , the fragrant pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B B E R S ' - ROOST . 121 front this bright-haired girl , were vastly different from the ( lark hours when the day was clone . Nothing couldbe truer than that this utterly incongruous and bitterly sweet situation could not last . In moments of humility , engenderedby the higher emotions this girl aroused , Jimclasped to his breast the fact that he was protecting her from worse men . Barnes and another of the cowboys had taken the horses for the Herricks up to the house . To Jim 's honest dismay he espied Helen riding ahead , with the cowboys behind , leading her brother 's mount . Herrick was not coming . The hounds bounded and cavorted about her , keen for the chase . Miss Herrick looked far less proud and unattainable in the boy 's riding-garb she had adopted . Moreover , ithad transformed her , yet her femininity appeared more provokingly manifest than ever . Barnes turned Herrick 's horse over to a stable-boy , and with his companion fell in behind Miss Herrick , whorode out upon the valley . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did n't Herrick come ? " asked Jim . " He was rowin ' with Heeseman , " replied Barnes , soberly . " You do n't say ! What about ? " " Reckon I do n't know . They shet up as I come along , " returned the cowboy . " But I seen enough to calkilatesomethin 's wrong . They was on the porch . Herrick lookedsort of peevish . He did n't want his sister to go huntin ' today , I heard thet . An ' she said right pert she was goin ' . " " How did Heeseman look ? " went on Jim , ponderingly . Something was up . For two days Heeseman 's outfit had been through hauling timber . " Dead serious , like he was tryin ' to persuade the boss to somethin ' . " 122 . R O B B E R S ' R O O S TJim lapsed into silence . What turn would affairs take next ? It was getting warm around Star Ranch . Each day the hunters had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown too tame for Miss Herrick ; besides , the rabbits had run off down the valley . Three or four miles out the hounds jumped a coyote from a clump of sagebrush , and the chase was on . At first the hounds gained , but after a mile or so the coyote kept the distance even between them . At what was only fifty feet the chase was noisy , fast , and exciting . The coyote led toward the low , wooded slope to the west and gained it , where the chase slowed up as far as the riders were concerned . The cowboys took the lead , then came Miss Herrick , while Jim brought up the rear . It was a long , gradual ascent up ' to an open ridge , where pine trees alternated with clumps of chaparral ; very fragrant and picturesque country . Here the hounds jumped a herd of deer . Despite the yelling of the cowboys , they dashed up the ridge with a chorus of wild yelps and barks . Barnes and his companionrider gave pursuit , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing . Jim caught up with Miss Herrick , who waited in an open spot among the pines . Flushed and disheveled , with her sombrero on the pommel , panting from the arduous ride , she made a distracting picture . " Hunt 's off for us , Miss Herrick , " said Jim . " The cowboys will be hours catching that pack . " " Too bad ! But was n't  --  it fun  --  while it  --  lasted , " she replied , gaily . " I 'm glad the coyote  --  got away . I had designs on  --  his brushy tail . " " Shall we ride down ? " went on Jim , uneasily . He had been alone with this girl on a couple of brief occasions , R O B B E R S ' R O O S T . 123just long enough to realize the danger of such a fateful accident as this . " Let us rest the horses . I 'm out of breath myself . . . . Listen . Do n't I hear the hounds ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to see deer bound on their springy legs . " Jim turned his ear to the wind . First he heard the beating of his blood , like a muffled drum , and then the swish of the tree-tops . " No . It 's not the hounds you hear . Only the wind in the pines . " " How mournful and sweet ! " she murmured . Jim dismounted to tighten his saddle-cinches . He felt queerly helpless , and impatient to be on the move . " Wall , take a look at my cinches , " she said . " May I ask you not to call me Wall ? " he queried , with unreasonable resentment . He hated the way she addressed him occasionally . " I must remind you I 'm no butler . " " Pray pardon me , " she rejoined , in surprise . " I presumeI should address you as Mister Wall ? " " Yes , if you 're too stuck up to call me Jim , " he said , rudely . She lifted her chin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm at it I 'll tell you this , too , " he went on , doggedly . " You must not ride around alone again . I 've had no chance to speak with you . But I told your brother . He laughed in my face . He is a damned fool . " " 1/Ir . Wall , I will not listen to such talk , " she spoke up , spiritedly . " Oh , yes , you will ! " he flashed , striding over to her horse . " You 're not in an English drawing-room now , confronted by a disrespectful butler . You 're in Utah , girl . And I am Jim Wall . " " That last is obvious , to my regret , " she returned , 124 R O B B E R S ' - R O O S Tcoldly . " Will you please be so kind as to tighten my cinches ? It will be the last service I shall require of you . " " Thank the Lord ! " ejaculated Jim , in grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . If you were an American tenderfoot , it would n't be hard to make you understand . If you were Western , you would not need to be told . But as an English lady of quality , who thinks class , her class will protect her anywhere , you need to be jarred . . . . It 's wrong for you to ride around alone on this range like any wild tomboy . " " Why ? You intimated this on our way from Grand Junction . But you do not give me any concrete reasons why it is wrong . " " Some of these men might kidnap you for ransom . " " Nonsense ! " she retorted , contemptuously . " Or one of them might waylay you with worse in-tention . " " Mr. Wall , I still believe your intention is good , but you grossly exaggerate the dangers out here , if there are any . Bernie asked I lcescnian about this and was assuredthat you , being from Wyoming , maligned Utah . " " Ha ! Ha ! Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that information . " What do you say , Miss Herrick , when I tell you that l lank I lays has been watching you from the ridges , riding the lonely trails , biding his chance to waylay you ? " She paled at that , or at his piercing look and changeof tone . " I do n't believe it , " she said , presently . " For some reasonyou are over-zealous on my behalf . It is becomingabsurd . " " You think I lie ? " " Mr. Wall , I did n't call you a liar , " she returned , in annoyance . " I did sayR O B B E R S ' - R O O S T 125 " And you 'll go on riding alone when it suits your royal fancy ? " he queried , witheringly . " That is no longer any concern of yours , " she replied , at last stung . " But I certainly shall ride when and how I please . " " Then you 're as big a damn fool as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here I am , the only man in this Star outfit with honesty enough and guts enough to tell you the truth . And I get insulted and fired for my pains . " She sat her horse , mute . Jim laid a strong hand on her pommel and shook it . " Your saddle 's loose . Will you oblige me by getting off ? " " I can ride it back , " she rejoined , icily . " But your blanket will slip out . The saddle might turn with you . . . . At that it might be a good thing for you to fall off and hit your head on a rock . " She removed her boot from the stirrup . " Tighten the cinches then  --  and hurry . " Jim complied expeditiously enough , but in doing so he accidentally touched her . Something like fire shot through him at the contact . Under its stimulus he looked up to say a few more words to her , words to mitigate his offense and protest his sincerity . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lace of her boot , and when Jim raised his head it was to find his face scarcely a foot from her red lips . Without a thought , in a flash , he kissed them , and then drew back stricken . With startled movement she jerked erect , her face flushing scarlet . " How dare you ! " she cried , in incredulous amaze and anger . " My God ! I did n't mean that ! " ejaculated Jim . " It just happened . I  --  I do n't know  --  " 126 R O B B E R S ' R O O S TShe swung her leather quirt and struck him across the mouth . The blood spurted . The leap of Jim 's fury was as swift . He half intercepted a second blow , which stung his neck , and snatching the squirt from her hand he flung it away . Then his iron clutch fastened in her blouse . One lunge dropped her out of the saddle . He wrapped his other arm around her and bent her back so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . His mouth hard pressed on hers stilled any but smotheredcries . There was a moment 's fierce wrestling . She was no weakling , but she was in the arms of a maddened giant . Repeatedly he kissed her lips , long , hard , passionatekisses . Suddenly she collapsed , heavily in his arms . The shock of that  --  its meaning  --  pierced Wall with somethinginfinitely more imperious and staggering than bitter wrath . He let go of her . Reeling away from him to collidewith the pine tree , she sank against it , slid to her knees , and thrust out with repelling gesture of hands spread toward him . " There  --  my English lady  --  maybe that will convince you ! " he panted , hoarsely . His chin quivered and there was terrific commotion in his breast . " If you were n't a  --  pink-and-white-faced  --  washed-out  --  ninny of an aristocrat. . . if you had any  --  blood in you  --  I 'd prove  --  by God !  --  what men are in Utah ! . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to save my life . . . . Now getup. , , She obeyed him , slowly , with one hand clutching nervelesslyat the bark of the pine , the other at her breast . There was blood on her lips and cheeks ; otherwise her face was like alabaster . " I think I must have been in love with you  --  and wanted to protect you  --  from men worse than myself , " he went on , huskily . " I hope to God this will be a lesson to you . . . . Keep your beautiful face and body fromR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 127sight of Ilank Hays-or any of these robbers . Their thirst for gold is nothing compared to that for a woman . They are starved . They would almost eat you alive . 1t 's criminal carelessness for you to go about as you do , brazenly , as if it were your due to let the sun shine on your head for men to see . Your brother was crazy to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ! Go before it 's too late . Make him go . He will be ruined shortly . " She wiped the blood from her cheeks , and then , shudderingly , from her lips . " You  --  outraged me that way  --  to frighten me ? " she presently whispered , in horror , yet as if fascinated by something looming . " Get on your horse and ride ahead of me , " he ordered , curtly . " Now , Miss Helen Herrick , one last word . Do n't tell your brother what I did to you till after I 'm gone . ... If you do , I 'll kill him ! " She left a glove lying on the ground . Jim made no effortto recover it . His horse had grazed a few paces away , and when he had reached him and mounted , Miss Herrick was in her saddle . Jim let her get a few rods in advance before he followed . The excess of his emotion wore off , leaving him composed , and sternly glad the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerable for him . It mocked him that he had actually desired to appear well in the eyes of this girl . How ridiculous that one of a robber gang should be vain ! But he was not conscious that being a thief made any difference in a man 's feeling about women . He knew that he could not command respect or love ; but that in no wise inhibited his own feelings. ; Strange to realize , he had indeed fallen in love with Helen Herrick . She rode on slowly down the ridge without looking to128  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tright or left . Her gaze appeared to be lowered . The droop of her head and of her shoulders indicated shame and dejection . Outraged by a few kisses taken by force ! She would remember them  --  the brutal kisses of a hard man . Jim would remember forever that first kiss , surprisedon sweet , full lips . The ranch-house came in sight , not far down now , standing out yellow against the green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if that had been the last thing in her mind . It recalled perhaps that she must face her brother presently . Jim had nearly caught up with her when she rode on again , bracing in her saddle . The next time he looked she had recovered the old poise and grace . When they got clown to the level bench at a point where the road curved up from below , Miss Herrick waited for Jim to come up abreast of her . She gazed straight ahead , her face coldly pure against the green . " Can you be gentleman enough to tell me the truth ? " she asked . " I have not lied to you , " replied Jim , in weary amaze . Who could make anything of a woman ? " That  --  that first time you kissed me  --  was it honestly unpremeditated ? " " Miss Herrick , I do n't know what to swear by  --  havingno God or honor or anything . But , yes I have . My mother ! I swear by memory of her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked up . There your face was close . Your lips red ! And I kissed them . " They went on for perhaps ten paces , as far as the road , before she spoke again . " I believe you , " she said , without a tremor of the rich , low voice , though it was evident her emotion was deeply stirred . " Your action was inexcusable , unforgivable . But I should not have struck youR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 129with the whip . . . . That , and your passion to frighten me , perhaps justified your brutality .. . . I shall not tell . . . . Do n't leave Star Ranch . " For an instant Jim felt as if he were upon the verge of a precipice . That was the crowning shock of this unnaturalexperience . What she meant no wit of Jim 's could fathom ; he could only take her literally . But her change from revulsion to inscrutable generosity called to all that was good within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I must leave , " he replied , sadly . " I 'm only a wandering rider  --  a gun-slinger and  --  a member of a gang of robbers . And I was mad enough to fall in love with you . . . . Forget it . . . . Go home to England . But if you wo n't do that  --  never ride out alone again . " He spurred his horse and galloped down the road , by the barns and across the court , into the lane that led along the brook . Suddenly he espied a compact group of mounted riders coming down the road beyond Hays ' cabin . They bestrode bays and blacks , and there was that about them which drew Jim sharply up with a fiery thrill . Smoky 's outfit ! Chapter EightHAYS stood out in front of the cabin , bareheaded , his legs spread apart as if to anchor himself solidly , his hands at his hips , his sandy hair standing up ruffled like a mane . " Huh ! The boss is n't mad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ! I 'll bet his teeth are grinding thunder . . . . Small wonder . Smoky 's outfit has busted loose or is going to . . . . Well , now , I 've a hunch there 's luck in this for me . " Jim turned off into the corral , and took his time unsaddling . He did not wish to appear in a hurry to know what was up . He fed Bay grain and did not turn him into the pasture . Moreover , he left his rifle in its saddle-sheath . If he did not miss his calculation he would be riding away from Star Ranch that night , a thought that afforded reliefeven while it stabbed . Above the babble of the brook he heard the angry voice of the robber leader . Jim made for the bridge then , and crossing , looked up to see the horses of Smoky 's outfit standing , bridles down , and the riders up on the porch . Jim mounted the steps . Hank Hays sat upon the bench , his shaggy head against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of men leaning on the porch rail . Hays ' long legs stuck out , with his spurs digging into the porch . He looked , an infuriated , beaten man , and his twitching lips attested to impotentspeech . Smoky was lighting a cigarette , not in the least perturbed , but his eyes had a hard , steely gleam . Brad Lincolnsat back on the rail , eying the chief with a sardonic grin . Mac appeared more than usually ghoulish ; Bridges and Sparrowhawk Latimer betrayed extreme nervousness . " Howdy , Jim ! " spoke up Smoky. 130R O B B E R S ' R O O S T . 131 " Hello men ! What 's the mix ? Am I in or out ? " returnedJim , sharply . " I reckon you 're in , " replied Slocum . " Hank is the only one thet 's out . . . . Hyar , Jim , ketch this . " He drew a dark-green bundle from a bulging pocket and tossed it to Jim , so quickly that it struck Jim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a large heavy roll of greenbackstied with a buckskin thong . " Yours on the divvy , Jim , " went on Smoky . " Do n't count it now . There 's a heap of small bills inside , an ' if you untie them hyar there 'll be a mess . But it 's a square divvy to the last dollar . " The denomination of the bill on the outside was one hundred . The roll would not go inside his vest or hip pocket , and it took force to put it in his side pocket . " That 's a hefty roll , Smoky , for a man to get for nothing , " observed Jim , dubiously . " But the boss does n't look particularly happy about it . " Jim then noticed that a roll of bills , identical with the one he had just received , lay on the floor. " - - - - ! You double-crossed me ! " burst out Hays , at length . " Wal , thet 's accordin ' to how you look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us when you ought to ' ave been . We could n't ride forty miles every day to talk with you . Things came up at Grand Junction . We seen some of Heeseman 's outfit . Shore as hell they 're onto us , or will be pronto .

" Thus appealed to , Jim made a serious matter of it and addressed Hays point-blank . " Smoky 's right . If you meant to clean out Herrick , that was the way to do it . " " Aw  --  shore , you 'd side with them . " " I would n't do anything of the kind , if I thought they were wrong , " retorted Jim , angrily . Here was a chance to inflame Hays that he jumped at . If the robber could be drawn into a fight , when his own men were against him , the situation for the Herricks could be made easier for the present . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , and this one here at Star Ranch is a damn poor one , whatever it is . " " Wal , thet 's none of your bizness , Jim Wall , " declared Hays , more sharply . " But it is . What do you think I am ? A sucker ? If I 'm in this outfit , anything you plan and all you plan is my business , same as it 's Smoky 's and the rest of the outfit . " " You 'd better shet up . " " I wo n't shut up , Hays . Some one has to have the guts to tell you . And I 'm that fellow . There 's no hand-out against you in this outfit .

" Hays glared like a mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardedly rose . " Take care , boss , " spoke up Smoky . " Who 's runnin ' this outfit ? " he hissed . " Nobody jest now . I tried to talk sense to you . An ' Jim shore is talkin ' sense . Thet guy can talk , Hank . An ' you got ta get it in your thick head thet he 's talkin ' for all of us . " " Who 's thet thick skulled ? But I 'm sorer'n hell . I ai n't ready to leave Star Ranch , an ' now , by Gawd ! I 'll have to ! " " Why ai n't you ready ? " queried Smoky , curiously . " Our work 's all done . We 've cleaned out the ranch , except for a few thousand head . We 've got the long green . You ought to be tickled to death . " " I 'm not through here , " replied the robber , righting himself . " Wal , you ought to be . Thet Heeseman outfit will be after us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? This rancher , Herrick , likely has some cash around the house . He pays cash . But , hell ; Hank , you ca n't rob the man of his spare change . We 've done awful good an ' we 're heeled as never before . " Hays appeared gradually to relax under the cool persuasivearguments of his lieutenant . Jim saw his coveted chance glimmering . " Smoky , why do n't you ask Hays what this mysteriousdeal is ? " queried Jim , sarcastically . From a cornered lion Hays degenerated into a corneredrat . Jim sank a little in his boots while his upper muscles corded . " Hank , what'n hell 's got into you ? " queried Smoky , 134  --  R O B B E R S '  --  R O O S Thigh-voiced . " Glarin ' at Jim like a trapped coyote . An ' me too ! " " Smoky , the boss is up a tree , " said Jim , caustically .

Haw ! So thet 's what 's eatin ' you , Hank ? " Hays had reached his limit and probably , but for Smoky 's mirth , would have started hostilities . He hesitated , but there was a deadly flare in the eyes he had fixed on Wall . Smoky got between them . " See hyar , Hank . So thet 's the deal ? An ' you 'd do fer pore Jim hyar jest because he 's onto you ? . . . Wal , if you 're so damn keen as thet to draw on somebody , why , make it me . I started this . I dragged Jim into it .

" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he declared , hoarsely . " I 'm bull-headed . . . . An ' I lost my bull-head over Herrick 's sister and the money I could make out of her . " " There .

An ' if you 'd gone crazy , like you did once , an ' dragged her away into the brakes with us , by Gawd ! we 'd quit you cold .

" ' Most ready , boss . " " Fall to , men . I 've got to do some tall thinkin ' , " he said . Before they were half finished with their supper Hays entered and sailed his sombrero into a corner . His face was a dark mask . " We 're shakin ' the dust of Star Ranch tonight , " he said , deliberately . " Pack up an ' leave at once . I 'll come later . If I do n't meet you at Smoky 's camp at sunup , I 'll meet you shore at midday in thet cedar grove above the head of Red Canyon . " " Good ! " ejaculated Smoky . " Wal , it was about time , " added Brad Lincoln . " You 'll aim to roost up somewheres till this blows over ? " " Thet 's the idee . Smoky , did you remember to pack out them extra supplies I told you to ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' not get scurvy . " No one asked any more questions or made any more comments . Whatever they thought about Hays ' peculiar way of leading his band they kept to themselves . Jim Wall was not greatly relieved ; still , he concluded that Hays must abandon any plot he might have concocted toward Herrick 's sister . To be sure , he would take the bull by the horns this last night , and attempt to rob Herrick . But that latter possibility did not worry Jim particularly . The young woman had just had a valuable lesson . She would not be easy to surprise or take advantage of . At any rate , whatever was in Hays ' mind , Jim could not further risk alienating him or his men . Jim would have to ride out with them . If he stayed behind to spy upon Hays or frustrate any attempt he might make to call upon136 . R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tthe Herricks , he would have to kill Hays . He did not mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go riding it alone in this unknown country , with Smoky and the others hunting for him . " Pack up fer me , somebody , " said Hays . " I 'll keep watch outside . We shore do n't want to be surprised by Heeseman the last minit . " Dusk was mantling the valley when Jim went out . Under the bench the shadows were dark . From the shelterof the pines he looked for Hays , expecting to find him standing guard . But the robber was not on the porch . He was stalking to and fro along the brook , and he was no more watching for Heeseman than was Jim . His bent form , his stride , his turning at the end of his beat , his hands folded behind his back  --  all attested to the mood of a gloomy , abstracted , passion-driven man . Jim cursed under his breath . Here was a situation where , if he gave way to suspicions that might be overdrawn , prompted by his own jealousy rather than facts , he would certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Almost he distrusted his own fears . But he was in love with Miss Herrick and that had biased him . Hank Hays was blackguard enough to do anything to make money out of a woman , but he would scarcely betray his faithful followers . Hays was as loyal to them as they were to him . Honor among robbers ! Still , in the case of a magnificent creature like Helen Ilerricic Jim wrenched himself out of sight of the stalking robber . IIe was not superhuman . He had to make a choice , and he made it , on the assumption that his fears for Helen , surrounded by servants and with her brother , were actually far-fetched , if not ridiculous . Whereupon Jim repaired to his covert , rolled his bed and made a pack of his other belongings . What to doR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 137with the two packages of bills , this last of which was large and clumsy for his pockets , was a puzzle . By dividingthe two into four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the cabin . All was cheery bustle there . The men were glad to get away from Star Ranch . They talked of the robbers ' roost Hays had alwayspromised them , of idle days to eat and drink and gamble , of the long months in hiding . " Wal , you all ready ? " queried Hays , appearing in the doorway . " Yep , an ' bustin ' to go . " " On second thought I 'd like one of you to stay with me . How about you , Latimer ? " " All right , " declared Sparrowhawk . " This all right with you , Smoky ? " " Suits us fine . If you ask me , I 'd say you 'd better keep Jim an ' me , too , with you . " " I would if there was any chance of a fight . . . . Take Sparrow 's pack-hoss , an ' mine , too . " In a few more minutes all the men leaving were mounted . The pack-animals , with packs gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried hard to get a look at Hays ' face , but the lights were out and gloom hung thick everywhere . " Wait at your camp till sunup , " said Hays , conclusively . " An ' if I 'm not there I 'll meet you about noon shore at head of Red Canyon . " Without more words or ado Smoky led off behind the pack-horses , and the five riders followed . Once across the brook , all horses took to a brisk trot . Jim Wall looked back . The cabin faded in the gloom under the bench . Not for a mile or more did Jim glance over his shoulder again . Then he saw a bright light on the bench . That was from Herrick 's house . He and his sister would be sitting in the living-room , reading or talking . After all , 138 - R O B B E R S ' . R O O S T R O B B E R S ' - R O O S T  --  139how easy for Hank Hays to corner them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not down . An unfamiliar sensation , like a weight of cold lead in his breast , baffled Jim . He knew he was glad that he would never see Helen Herrick again . The spring night waxed cold as the hours wore on and the riders took to the slope . When they got up above the valley , out of the gray mists and shadows , the stars shone bright and white . A steady clip-clop of hoofs broke the silence . The riders proceeded in single file and seldom was a word spoken , except to a lagging pack-horse . About midnight Smoky turned the pack-animals up the slope into the woods , and after a mile of rough going emerged into an open canyon head . Water splashed somewheredown over rocks . " Hyar we air , " said Smoky , making leather creak as he wearily slid off . ' Throw things an ' git to sleep . I 'll stand first guard . " Evidently the horses were not to be turned loose . Nevertheless , Jim put hobbles on Bay . The men spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim overheard Brad Lincoln offer to bet that Hays would not show up at sunrise . Gradually they quieted down , one by one . Jim unrolled his bed beside a rock and , pulling off his boots and unbuckling his gun-belt , he crawled under the blanket . He was neither tired nor sleepy . White stars blinked down pitilessly and mockingly . Would he ever lie down again without the face of Helen Herrick before him , without the lingering fragrance and softness of her lips on his ? But that was something different to remember . He welcomed it . And he lived over everything leading up to that kiss , and after it that fierce attack he had made upon her lips . Lastly came her amazing requestto him not to leave Star Ranch , and this abode with him until he fell asleep . Crack of ax and Happy Jack 's voice pierced his shunberboth recognized before he opened his eyes . The sun was topping the eastern range . Jim sat up , stretched , and reaching for his boots he gazed around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowing to a timber belt below . Behind rose shrubby limestone walls , in a crack of which poured a gush of water . The men were stirring , two around the camp fire and others among the horses . Happy Jack fetched an armload of wood ; Bridges was slicing bacon . Jim smelled a mixture of wood smoke and coffee . " Wal , long past sunup , " said Slocum as he approached the fire . " Who was it bet Brad thet Hank would n't show up ? " " Nobody , " replied Lincoln . " Jim , suppose you take your rifle an ' sneak down an ' knock over a deer , " suggested Smoky . " I see a buck an ' three does a minnit ago . If you get one , gut it an ' leave it lay . We 'll throw it on a hoss as we go down . We 're gon na need fresh meat . But shore step out of the woods first an ' see if Hank 's comin ' , or anybody . " Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a wonderful blaze of sun ! The valley burned purple and red . There were no riders on the winding , white trail . Jim took a long look , at the lilachazed , canyoned abyss to his left . It was a sight to make even a hardened rider gasp . It was enough to make Westernerslove their wilderness . There seemed to be no reality in the endless black line of Wild Horse Mesa . Stealthily working back into the timber , he soon espied two deer about sixty paces distant , long ears erect . He killed the buck standing , and sent a quick shot after the bounding doe , but missed . ' Upon his return to camp , Smoky greeted him with a grin . " I jest bet Brad thet you busted two . " 140  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 1 R O B B E R S ' R O O S T  --  141 " Sorry ; you lose . I missed the doe . Buck 's big and fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra pack-horses . Wal , Jim , gobble some grub . We 're on the prod . " " how far to Red Canyon ? " asked Jim . " I do n't know . About fifteen miles  --  Utah miles , haw ! haw ! Do n't you remember thet heavy grove of cedars leadin ' clown into a red hole ? " " Reckon I do . If I lays joins us there , it 'll mean he comes by another trail , does n't it ? " " If ! So you figger he might not ?  --  course he 'd come around the mountain , or mehbe over another pass . He shore knows trails diet we do n't . " " Aw , IIank 'll show up on time . " " Wonder if he stayed back to plug Heeseman ? He hates thet rustler . " In less than hour the riders were on the move down the mountain . Packing on the deer Jim had slain occasioneda little delay for all , because Smoky kept them close together . At the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconnoiter . Then he called , " Come hyar , a couple of you long-sighted fellers . " They all rode out to join him , where he sat his horse , pointing to a faint blur on the purple valley floor . " Is thet dust ? " Most of the riders inclined to the opinion that it was just haze . " Ten miles or more back and hard to make out , " spoke up Jim . " If this was my range , I 'd say it was n't haze or smoke . " " Wish I had Hank 's glasses . My eyes are no good any more fer long shots . Wal , let 's mozy . At thet distancewe do n't give a damn what it is . " Nevertheless , Jim noted that Smoky led to the left , across the ravine , along the edge of the timber belt overa ridge , and then down to the trail . Soon they turned a yellow corner of wall to come out at the point where Hays had described the expanse to Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all was pale and dim in the white , solemn light , but now , just after sunrise , it seemed a dazzling world of rainbow wheels , glorious to the gaze . So different was it that Jim could not recognize any particular point Hays had designated . There were now a thousand striking landmarks rising out of the colorfulchaos . To Jim 's regret , however , this spectacle soon dropped behind gray foothills . Smoky pushed the pack-horses at a trot . They wound in and out of the brushy hills , at length to leave them for the long slant of greasewood and gravel which led down into the brakes . Here on the left the great bulk of the black white-tipped Henrys towered majestically , lost in perpetual clouds . Once Jim caught sight of the windingserrated wall of rock across the ghastly barrens , and it was a brilliant purple , except at the far-distant end , where it paled to lavender . Far ahead a black fringe of cedars thickened to a grove above a red jagged line which was the canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached another turn from which it was possible to look back for five miles or more , Smoky halted while the others caught up . " Jeff , you hang right hyar , " he said , " an ' keep your eyes peeled on the back trail . I ai n't so shore thet gray patch back on the valley was haze . It sort of moved to me . An ' there was n't a lick of wind . Wal , from round this corneryou can easy see the cedar grove where we 'll hang up fer the boss . An ' if you ketch sight of any more'n a couple riders on the back stretch , you come ridin ' hellbentfer election . Do n't stay long after noon . " 142 . R O B B E R S ' . R O O S TPerhaps another five miles down the slope lay their objective to which they headed . The gait was slowed a little , if anything , yet in somewhat over an hour the riders arrived at the cedars . Jim recalled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined , the point where Hays had led up out of the brakes of the Dirty Devil . The hour was still some time before noon . Smoky scanned the slope to the south and east . It would not have been possible to see riders at any distance , as the rocks , brush , ridges , and washes intervened profusely . " What 'll we do , Smoky ? Throw the packs or not ? " queried one of the riders . " Dog-gone if I know , " replied Slocum , peevishly . " It 's a rummy deal . I lot as hell now an ' gettin ' hotter . I forgot to ask I lank . Reckon you 'd better herd the hosses an ' we 'll wait . 1 ' 11 keep a lookout fer the boss . " Jim tied his horse in the shade of a cedar , and climbed a jumble of rocks so he could command a better view . Almost at once he sighted riders coming down a wash about a mile away , and he had opened his mouth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly that he bit his tongue . He rubbed his eyes and looked again . Three riders ! Assuming that two of them were Hays and Latimer , who could the third be ? They disappeared behind a cornerof bank . Jim sank down in a cold sweat . Perhaps these men were Indians , or strangers from Hankville , or prospectors . But he had not seen any pack-animals . After a long , anxious watch he saw the three reappear in the wash , considerably closer . The one in the middle rode a gray horse and otherwise contrasted sharply with the dark mounts and dark clothes of the other two . A second time the trio disappeared . Smoky was peering about in a desultory manner , but he was too low down to sight the riders . Jim was now shaking . An awful premonitionR O B B E R S ' . R O O S T- 143attacked him . He had met it and most overcome it as another unaccountable attack of nerves when the foremosthorseman emerged from behind a bank . He recognized the stalwart figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddle . That man was Hank Hays . Jim scarcely dared shift his gaze back to the second rider , but he was irresistibly forced to . A slighter figure in tan , drooping in the saddle ! " So help me God ! " he whispered , and sank down on the stone . That center rider was Helen Herrick . For a moment a hell rioted in Jim Wall 's breast . How he cursed himself for a vacillating idiot ! His intuition had been right . He had seen through this robber leader 's behavior at Star Ranch . But like a fool he had not trusted himself . That trick spelled death for Hank Hays . Jim grew cold to his very marrow . Yet his intelligence did not wholly succumb to his fury . He strove to think . This blackheartedhound had gotten Helen , just how , it was useless to conjecture . But to kill him then , right on the spot ? That gave Jim Wall pause . Hays ' men would roar , at this deal , involving them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go so far as to resist hinf with arms . He would be cocky , radiant , conciliatory now . Jim crushed down his deadly impulse . He would wait . He would hear what the others had to say . He would bide his time . Well indeed had it been for Jim to espy this trio long before they reached him . He had time to recover , to think what was best . If Hank Hays had come upon Jim suddenly , it would have been to his doom . One of the pack-animals neighed shrilly and then all the horses stuck up their ears . " Say , I heerd a hossshoe ring on a stone , " called Mac , who had ears as keen as a horse. 144 . R O B B E R S ' R O O S T " What 's thet ? " queried Smoky , sharply . He leaped up . " Look ! Riders comin ' , " exclaimed Brad Lincoln . " Ca n't be nobody but Hank . " Jim leaped off the rock , crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoky , it 's Hays . I saw him a mile off . " " Why'n hell did n't you say somethin ' , then ? " retorted Slocum , gruffly . " I was too flabbergasted , " replied Jim , coolly , as he joined them . " It 's Hank , all right , " said Mac . " Shore , I see him now . Thet 's Hank . " " Jim , what flabbergasted you ? " demanded Slocum . " Three riders ! " flashed Jim . " Wal ! . . . So I see . What you make of thet ? " ejaculatedSlocum . The three emerged clearly from behind the cedars . A blank silence ensued . Jim at last got the tigerish nerves under control . His thoughts were whirling . " Humph ! Little rider in between , " commented Lincoln . " Thet 's Sparrowhawk behind . " " Who 's the third party ? " " Hank shore is a queer duck , takin ' up with strangers like he does . " " Somebody with a mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Fellers , " rasped out Slocum , " thet 's a woman with a veil ! " Jim thought the moment had come . " Men , Hank has doublecrossed us . He 's stolen Herrick 's sister ! " " The I " ! " cursed Slocum . No more was said after that profane outburst . It probably voiced the unity of the watchers . Hank Hays led his two followers to within a few feet of the clusterR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 145of riders , when he leaped off and checked the gray horse . Sparrowhawk came right on . Jim 's lightning-swift glance took the three in , their dust-caked horses , and flashed back to fasten upon Miss Herrick . Her features were not visible through the veil . The linen coat showed the wear and tear of contact with brush . To Jim 's incredulousamaze , she had on riding-boots and overalls . She sat free in the saddle , with neither hands nor , feet bound . The gray horse carried a long pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all here but Jeff , " began Hays . He had a bold front , a piercing eye . Fear of man or beast or God did not abide in him them . " Jeff 'll be comin ' by now , " replied Smoky . " We ai n't got a hell of a lot of time to wait , " said Hays . " Whar you aimin ' fer ? " " Brakes of the Dirty Devil . " " But we was goin ' around an ' head thet hot hell hole . " " No time . " Brad Lincoln thrust himself forward , black of face , hitching his gun-belt . " Who 's the third party ? " " Wal , you can guess , " leered Hays . " I take it you 've fetched Herrick 's sister . " " You 're a bright boy . Go to the head of the class .

" Jim turned to the dejected figure on the gray horse . " Miss Ilerrick , is lie telling the truth ? " " Yes , he stole the for ransom , " she replied , with emotion . " They broke into my room  --  one through the window  --  theother at the door . They threatened me with guns . . . . If I screamed they 'd kill me !

An ' after , we made him promise to pay handsome . An ' " That 's enough , " snapped Jim . " Give me a man or two . We 'll take her back and get the money . " " Hold on . Thet was somethin ' I had in mind , " drawled Hays . " But it did n't work . I had to kill Progar . An ' " Who 's Progar ? " " Wal , he 's Heeseman 's right-hand man .

" The ensuing rush was quelled by Smoky 's ringing order . " Hold on ! It 's Jeff ! " " Lordy ! Look at him come ! No wonder he sounded like a stampede . " An opening in the grove showed Bridges plunging upon them . Wild-eyed and snorting smoke , his big charger threw gravel all over them . " Heeseman 's outfit trailin ' us , " he announced .

" You assured me that if I 'd come without resistance you 'd soon arrangefor my freedom . Here we are miles from Star Ranch .

" Once we reach the river I can give them the slip . " " Aw , you 're crazy , " derided Smoky . " Heeseman knows this country as well as you . " The leader did not answer that taunt . He headed down the slope , dragging Miss Herrick 's horse . Sparrowhawk Latimer fell in with them . Jim could hear the girl 's protestations . The other riders made haste to line the packhorses . Smoky brought up the rear . The wash that Hays had come down was the one which led into the Red Canyon . It was shallow , dusty , hot . The dry stream-bed afforded easy progress . Jim could not see any sign of a trail or even of an old hoof track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode as one familiar with this red-clay and gray-gravel canyon . Soon it merged with another coming in from the left , and then all features were magnified . It began to drop , the stream-bed grew rough , the walls higher . All landmarks above were lost sight of ; even the Henry Mountains disappeared . The pack-horses kicked up a dust like a red cloud ; the riders pulled their scarfs up over mouths and noses . Their yells and curses sounded muffled . Jim kept unobtrusively working ahead until there were only three pack-horses in front of him and he could see Hays and the girl at intervals . Latimer hung close to them . The canyon deepened . No more places occurred where it might have been possible to lead a horse up . And148150  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tnot long after that the walls became so steep that a man could not have climbed them . The direction of this canyon appeared to be swinging toward the north , but how much Jim could not estimate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then to the right , and again almost behind . Short patches of shade were exceedingly welcome . The horses began to be covered with a lather of dust , sweat , and froth . Jim looked back . Brad Lincoln , his face uncovered , red and wet , rode close behind the last pack-horse . Then followed Jeff , Mac , Happy Jack , and lastly Slocum , dark harsh figures , their very attitudes expressing resentment at this unexpectedflight . Slocum was the only one who betrayed any sign of their being tracked , and he kept looking back and up at the ragged rims . Gradually the sand and rocks and holes slowed the pack-horses to a walk . ! lays yelled back for his riders to hurry .

But how , when , where ? He could only go on and await developments . The immediate necessity was flight , until some safe retreat had been found . An hour or more of this travel , the first half of which had been rapid , the last slow , brought them to a comparativelylong stretch of canyon with a turn . This was too open and unsafe to suit Jim . And evidently it increasedSmoky 's concern , for he bawled out to push the pack-horses harder . The next sign from Smoky was a rifle-shot . It bellowedR O B B E R S ' R O O S T  --  151out from wall to wall . Jim , wheeled to see that he was throwing in another shell , both gun and face pointed back and up toward the right wall . " What you shootin ' at ? " yelled Brad , jerking out his rifle . The other riders shouted hoarse queries . Jim espied something flash along the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it were a pursuer . " Rustle ! " shrilled Smoky . " I seen riders . They ducked back . They 'll aim to head us off . " Hays bawled back an order and pointed aloft . Jim , from his point , could not see the very evident danger . Halfway down this long stretch , on the right side , opened a deep canyon . That would surely block pursuers , at least until they had headed it , which might require miles of travel . At any rate , it relieved Jim . He , with the riders behind , had the pack-horses loping , a risky thing , because if a pack slipped thereby stopping the horse , it would have to be abandoned . And to these fugitives , going down into this hole , packs were incalculablyprecious . Suddenly riders popped into view back on the point of the intersecting canyon . Hays and Latimer opened fire with their side-arms , the .45 Colts , the heavy bullets of which fell short , puffing yellow dust on the sloping point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim saw Latimer knocked off his horse , but he leaped up and mounted again , apparently not badly injured . He raced ahead after Hays , who rode fast , dragging the girl 's horse , and at the same time shooting at the riders until he passed around a corner of the canyon . Latimer soon disappeared after him . Then the riders above turned their attention to the rest of Hays ' outfit . " Come on ! " yelled Jim to those behind . " Run for it ! Our only chance ! " And charging after the galloping pack-152  --  R O B B E R S ' R O O S Thorses ahead , he let Bay find the way and threw up his rifle . The distance to the pursuing horsemen above , who were riding up and down , yelling , shooting , dismounting to run out , was close to four hundred yards  --  a long shot with the .44 Winchester from a horse . Heeseman 's outfit had the upper hand . They could stand or kneel and shoot . Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover . Jim heard their piercing yells , as well as the bellowing replies of the riders behind him . He had a quarter of a mile to ride to pass the corner ahead to safety . The pack-horses were scattered , tearing up the canyon . Jim gained on them . Then he began to shoot , aiming as best he could at that swift pace . Suddenlythe canyon awoke to an infernal din . The reports banging front salt to wall magnified a hundredfold , until there was a continuous roar . One of Jim 's first shots hit a horse , and his seventh connected with a rider , who plunged like a crippled rabbit back out of sight . The others of Heeseman 's outfit took alarm , dodged here and there to hide , or ran back . Jim emptied the magazine of his rifle just before he passed round into the zone of safety . Neither Hays nor the two with him were visible , but the canyon ahead had another sharp turn . Jim hauled Bay to a halt , and soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the slackening bellow of guns . Lincoln ( lashed into sight first , closely followed by Mac , Ilappy Jack , and Jeff , all with guns smoking . And lastly came Slocum , hatless , blood on his face , to rein his mount among them . " Smoky , did they  --  git you ? " queried Lincoln , in alarm . " Jest barked , " panted Slocum , spitting fire . " - -R O B B E R S ' R O O S T 153- - ! If we could only  --  fight it out ! . . . Looks all right ahead . Load yer guns  --  an ' ride on ! " Around the next turn they came upon Hays and his two riders . The pack-horses had slowed down behind them . With another big intersecting canyon on the right it looked as if their pursuers were held up . " Fellers , Heeseman will have to go back , " declared Lincoln . " Thet 'll take hours . I reckon Hank knowed what he was about . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " replied Smoky . " Bullet hit my rifle an ' glanced  --  skinnin ' me over the ear . " " Latimer , " replied Jim . " I saw him knocked off hishorse . But he was up , like a cat , and on again . " " Ahuh . Luck 's with us . Say , it 's hot . If we do n't come to thet river soon we 're cooked . " " Must be close now . " That last hopeful assertion , however , was wrong . The Dirty Devil , expected at every winding corner , failed to show up . Deeper and deeper grew the canyon , until its ragged , crumbling , colored walls as denuded as the dry floor , rose three hundred feet , and everywhere slides and shelves of soil hung ready for an avalanche . Mid-afternoon found the fugitives entering a less constrictedarea , where sunlight and open ahead attested to the vicinity of a wider canyon , surely the Dirty Devil . And so it proved . Mud-holes appeared in the stream-bed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirsty horses could scarcely be dragged . Then Red Canyon joined that of the Dirty Devil , a union which was startling in its nakedness . All was drab gray , yellow , and red , with the sullen river running shallowlyover sandbars . Hays waited for his riders and the pack-animals to 4 reach him. st154  --  R O B B E R S ' . R O O S T " Cinch up an ' look to the packs , " he ordered . " We 've hell ahead , but nothin ' no more behind . " " No ! Have n't we , though ? " queried Lincoln . " Do n't you fool yourself about Heeseman not follerin ' us . " " Wal , he 'll track us this fer , an ' thet 'll be his limit , " declared the robber . " There ai n't no man in Utah who can foller me into the brakes of the Dirty Devil . " " Hank , air you aimin ' for thet roost you always give us a hunch about but never produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Smoky , fer jest some such deal as this . . . . Pile off now . Once we hit the quicksand we cai n't stop fer nothin ' or nobody . Look to saddles an ' packs . " The riders complied . Jim , over the back of his horse , watched Miss Herrick when Hays made her get off . The long coat fell below her knees . She walked as if the use of her legs was almost gone . He saw her bend over stiffly , to rub them , and then lift her veil to let the gentle breeze blow upon her face . But presently , when Hays harshly called her to come back , she replaced the veil again . She was tiring and her head drooped . " Fellers , listen , " began Hays . " The river 's low . I was feared it might be up . It ought to be , ' cause by now the snow must be meltin ' . Luck shore is with us . Wal , jest foller me . Drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothin ' . " " Ahuh . All right . But Sparrowhawk looks pale an ' weak , " replied Slocum . " He 'll make it . We cai n't stop now to doctor him up . " " Sparrow , I ai n't trustin ' the boss so damn much . How bad air you hurt ? " " Not so bad , Smoky , " replied Latimer . " I was hit in the back , high up . The bullet 's in there . Hurts like hell . " " Ai n't you spittin ' blood ? " R O B B E R S ' R O O S T  --  155 " Shore , a little . I reckon my lung got nicked . But not bad ; I can ride . Do n't worry about me , Smoky . " Hays laid a rude hand on Miss Herrick . " Git on , an ' do n't let me hear any more squawks out of you . " The robber took up her halter and straddling his horse he spurred into the muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was quicksand , but it had a stiff crust ; it bent but broke only as the hoofs of the horses were being withdrawn . The pack-animals bunched on the shore ; then one led , and the others followed . Jim was alongside the foremost . Bay feared quicksand , yet trusted his rider . Hays led into the middle of the river and then turned downstream . He was never in difficulties and the gray horse carrying the girl got along still better . The water was scarcely six inches deep and this fact no doubt renderedtraveling easy at that point . Soon the whole cavalcade was splashing down the river , the riders behind and on each side of the packhorses . They left no trace of their tracks now . Washes and gorges and canyons opened into the Dirty Devil on both sides . Half a mile down , the river made a sharp bend and the canyon narrowed again to a dark , forbidding , many-hued crack . Hays kept on , getting into swifter and deeper water , where he plunged his horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which a slender , muddy stream emerged . That , thought Jim , should have been a good place to go up . But this robber knew where he was heading . He had a goal in mind . Nothing but death could have stopped him . The pack-horses floundered in places . Some of them stuck , only to be beaten to violent exertion , when they freed themselves to go on . Jim 's sight covered all the surroundings from moment to moment , always to be drawn back to that tan-clad form on the gray horse . Time156 R O B B E R S ' R O O S Tand again water splashed all over her ; her horse staggered , sank one hoof and then another , plunged to free himself , and got out ; she swayed in the saddle ; often she looked back , and no doubt , through her veil , could see Jim never far from her . Jim took it that she realized this was no accident . Hays passed other gorges breaking in from the left wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned into a crack that could not be seen a hundred yards back , and when Jim reached it he was amazed to see the robber leading up another narrow gorge , down which ran another swift , narrow stream . Jim appreciated that a man would have had to know where this entrance was , or he could never have found it . The opening was hidden by a point of wall which curved out and around . It opened down the river , and against the dark shade there was not visible from the opposite side of the canyon or from upriver any line of demarkation to show this secret gateway , which undoubtedly led into the wildest part of the brakes . This gash wound like a snake into the bowels of the colored , overhanging earth ; and part of the time Jim could not see Hays ahead nor more than a few of the pack-horses behind . When , however , the water began to lose something of its muddy nature , Jim concluded that the loamy soil of this canyon changed , or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . The canyon widened and the walls lowered ; grass and shrubs made their appearanceupon banks and shelves ; a heavy , gravel bottom gave the stream a rippling murmur ; huge rocks and caverned cliffs made their appearance . Still the volume of the stream did not diminish . By sunset Jim calculated the horses had traveled seven or eight miles without stepping once out of the water . TheR O B B E R S ' R O O S T 157heat and dust had vanished . Twilight thickened between the cliffs . And at last , at a point where the walls were scarcely a hundred feet high the canyon forked . Hays took the left fork , which was dry . And darkness soon hid from Jim any distinct features . Seldom did he see a gleam of Miss Herrick 's gray horse . The rims grew black ; stars burned in the strip of sky above ; the weary hoofs cracked on stone . Two long hours later Hays led up out of the boxing canyon . A hummocky , lonely , black-and-gray landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up and down , on through grass and weeds , across flats and ridges , the robber led for two or more hours longer , until Jim began to wonder how much more the packhorsescould stand . Then abruptly they began to descend into a black , round hole the dimensions of which were vague . Presently they reached a bottom from which weird , black , bold walls stood up , ragged of rim against the sky . Jim felt thick grass under his feet . He smelled damp earth ; he heard a rustle of cottonwood leaves . " Hyar we air , " called out Hays . " Throw saddles an ' packs . Let the hosses go . No fear of hosses ever leavin ' this place . " Jim alone heard the chief , and he passed the word back to his nearest follower , and presently the pack-horses stood drooping , gray-backed in the gloom . The riders were not too weary to express themselves after that grueling trip . " Where'n hell air we ? " " Smells good . " " Dawg-gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . " " Sparrow , how air you ? " " Alive yet an ' not bleedin ' . " In the gloom Jim 's night-owl eyes discerned Flays liftingMiss Herrick off her horse and half carrying her off158 R O B B E R S ' R O O S Ttoward the rustling cottonwoods . Jim , making pretense of leading his horse , followed until Hays stopped at the border of what appeared a round grove of cottonwoods impenetrable to the sight . He heard the tinkle of water near and a musical flow farther away and down . " Oh , for God 's sake  --  let go of me ! " gasped the girl , and sank down on the grass . " You may as wal get used to thet , " replied Hays , in low voice . " Do you want anythin ' to eat ? " " Water  --  only water . I 'm  --  choking . " " I 'll fetch some an ' a bed for you . " Little did Ilays realize , as he strode back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clutching hand on his gun and mad lust for blood in his heart . Jim knew he meant to kill Hays . Why not now ? But as before , he had the sagacity and the will to resist a terrible craving . With nerveless hands he unpacked his outfit and turned the wet , raw-shouldered pack-animal free with the others . Then he sat down upon his bed-roll , exhausted by the physical and mental excess of the last twenty-four hours . Above him a few rods the men were unpacking , their relief voiced in low talk . Hays passed with a bed-roll on his shoulder . Jim heard it thud to the soft turf close by in the shadow . " Any wood around this bloomin ' hole ? " Happy Jack shouted . " It 's midnight , but I 'll hatch up a snack of grub an ' coffee if we can start a fire . " " Darker'n hell , " growled Smoky . " An ' I shore got a headache . I 'd like to meet the hombre who bounced thet bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of energy and his voice vibrated . " Plenty firewood , " he said , cheerfully . " I 'll pack some up , Happy . Tomorrow you 'll see the greatest roost fer robbers in all Utah . " R O B B E R S ' - R O O S T  --  159 " It needs to be , " growled Lincoln . Jim listened , while he gazed around . He appeared to be down in a round hole , the circular walls of which stood up a hundred or more feet above him . Only a couple of notches , one V-shaped and large , to the west , and another small and shallow to the north , broke the level rim of the insulating walls . The stars turned very white in a dark blue sky . The low voices of the men and rattle of packs and the cutting sound of horses grazing seemed only to make the deep silence more permeating . The place fascinated . An owl hooted down somewhere in a canyon , and far away a wolf bayed blood-thirstily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growing light , and dark forms of men . Happy Jack was whistling . his cheerfulness was irritating . Could nothing upset him , tire him ? Jim waited until he saw Hays pass in the shadow , back to the camp fire , and then he , too , joined the men . " Boss , any guard tonight ? " asked Lincoln . " Nope . We wo n't stand guard except in daytime , " replied the robber . " Tomorrow I 'll show you the lay of the land . " " What kind of a roost is it , Hank ? Anythin ' like thet Dragon Canyon ? " " No indeed . I seen thet place once . It 's a cave high up  --  forty feet mebbe , from the canyon bed . You have to go up on a pole with steps cut in . But I was never up . Only one outlet to that burrow , an ' thet 's by the same way you come . This roost has four .
