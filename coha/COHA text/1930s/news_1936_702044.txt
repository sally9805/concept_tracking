txt Says Discipline Is Up to Athlete Because of training rules a swimming star has been dropped from the Olympic team by the committee . I wonder if the committeemen thought of what the Olympic Games stood for when they made that decision ? No , as I see it . All they were thinking of is that they should turn thumbs down on Mrs. Jarrett so that others would be more careful . What they should have thought of was that they were blocking one of the contestants from competing . You must remember that the idea of the Olympic Games is that individuals , not teams , from different countries compete . If , in breaking training she injures herself , no one is harmed but herself . She did not go over there to help the United States team win , but to show her own ability . The committee asked for contributions for the athletes and if it sends the athletes home it has called for contributions falsely . R. B. W. Palisades , N.
