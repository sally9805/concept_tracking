THE fallacy is in assuming that two hundred horsepower is better than one hundred horsepower . Or that a letter received in ten hours is sweeter than one which was three days on the way . The clean air through which the night mail flies is in strange contrast to the foul smell of the contracts ; and the brilliance of the miracle of flight has seemed only to deepen the gloom of the people who post and receive the letters of the world . Better than an inquiry into fraud would be one into speed . Science needs an arbiter , to sit in judgment on its tricks , and to examine its hopes and aspirations to make sure that they , too , are streamlined . Let the physicist who is without guilt post the first air-mail letter . WE were an eye-witness ( a very bright-eye-witness ) to the riot at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street when the Socialists and Communists battled with the police for Austria 's sake , It was quite an affair . One point at issue was whether the Socialist delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Austrian Consul . " Would you like to join us ? " asked the Communist leaders of the Socialists , who were sitting outside the Consul 's door . " Would you like to join us ? " retorted the Socialists , who were there first . So they finally joined each other and protested . That same evening we attended another riot , in a movie theatre . It was over Clark Gable , the bourgeois actor , who was attending a world premiere in person  --  always an event that stirs the masses . Like the afternoon demonstration , it was feverish and intense . The cops had to bring Mr. Gable in , to get him there safely . If this country ever has a revolution , it will probably be a good deal like a movie premiere , except there wo n't be any picture  --  which will he a break for everybody . OUR government , nevertheless , is not discouraged but goes cheerfully on in its paternalistic way .

LOOKING hack on the midnight teaparty of Rockefeller Plaza , with its ghostly plasterers , we feel that the Rockefellers showed little or no imagination in the matter . Possessed of a work of art which displeased them ( a fairly common dilemma in which anybody is apt to find himself ) , they lost their grip completely . We think they should have treated Senor Rivera 's work much as a newspaper treats a liberal columnist like Heywood Broun , whose opinions are not necessarily those of the paper . The Rockefellers had a mighty good thing in a Rivera mural : it was their chance to give the public an exclusive feature , and they could have done so conscientiously by affixing a small sign to the picture reading : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be worth . Sentiments expressed on this wall are not necessarily endorsed by the directors . " CAPITALISTS are apt to exagger- ate the effect of revolutionary art , anyway . Most murals do n't affect people at all , except in dining-rooms , where they sometimes interfere slightly with the action of the stomach juices . COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY , which owns the land , has been much brighter than the Rockefellers . Perhaps you have n't noticed the little bronze loophole which Columbia left for herself : a tiny tablet set in the middle of the pavement at either end of the Plaza . The inscription is as follows : PROPERTY LINE OF THE TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY . CROSSING IS BY PERMISSION ONLY , WHICH PERMISSION IS REVOCABLE AT WILL . Presumably Columbia could , if she wanted to , keep difficult people off the property . We half expect her to announce that there will be no more painters or un-painters on the premises . THE memorable thing about the Dog Show was the booing of the Scottish terrier . We watched a team of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar its disapproval . A fickle land , with styles in dogs changing along with styles in dresses ! The Scottish terrier achieved a fame such as no breed ever dreamed of , and then was victimized by its own national advertising . Public favor has swung over toward the more rangy breeds , dogs with legs . Setters are the adored of show-goers . Bedlingtons are popular with people of fashion , who seek the unusual and who would rather he seen dead than leading anything as common as a Scotty . It is all very sad . As the one-time owner of a Scottish terrier , whose memory we hold green , we wish to apologize to Gleniffer Ideal , Ramoon Certainty , Gleniffer Glad Eye , and Gleniffer Frivolity , for the rudeness of the spectators . To hear , in the short space of one week , a Scottish terrier booed by an audience and President Roosevelt criticized by Charles Lindbergh was a great strain on our nerves . The props of life seem to be crumbling fast . ? TIMELY NOTE : Lip in Hartford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aircraft Company distributed some very nice little NRA buttons to its employees . The blue eagle waved its defiant wings , there was the proud legend " We Do Our Part , " and the employees wore the buttons with an air . It was n't until a few days ago that a sharp-eyed busybody , examining his button carefully , discovered that the printer had made a tiny mistake . The firm 's name reads " Pratt &; Whitney Airgraft Company . " One was smugzled down to us . Lenox 1734 THE mansion where Joseph Pulit- zer lived is as cold as the moon . We shivered for an hour up and down its tremendous sprawl of rooms and halls one afternoon last week ; they are littered with ekbris and have been deserted for twenty years . The estate is turning the famous residence over to real-estate men to be made into apartments , and we wanted to see it as it was , hack before the war , when the nervous genius of the World glootned like a spider in his far , quiet corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abandoned masterpiece of Stanford White on Sc ' venty-third Street just east of Fifth Avenue until the new plans brought it into prominence again . It was completed in 1902 and for ten years vibrated to the power of the eccentric man who lived in curious soundproof rooms at one end of it . Then he died and the life went out of the place . Nobody has lived in it for two decades . None of the bells in the elaborate system of hells rings now , none of the myriad lights will light . Cold , lonely , and sad , but still magnificent , and a touch mysterious , the mansion is like a grand duchess gone blind and deaf in her old age . Pigeons flutter disconsolately outside the windows beyond the organ loft . The organ console stands at the head of the central marble staircase , covered with dust . The gold-and-white woodwork of the impressive main salon on the second floor , fifty feet long , with a ceiling twenty feet high , is tawdry under its dust ; the two large crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismal . Dirty windows keep out the light and give the baronial dignity of the mansion a deep , melancholy gloom . Before long it will be altered , polished , and brightened up , elegant doormen and lively attendants will move about , people will live there again , but it will he a different kind of life . Joseph Pulitzer probably was never inside of three-fourths of the rooms . He lived in a few padded rooms of his own to the west . The old doors of his hideaway , soft as leather chairs , are torn and ripped now , but the thick walls and the triple-sashed windows still shut out most of the street sounds that tore at the nerves of the publisher , whose hearing was sharpened by blindness . He had lost his sight when he moved into No. 7 and never saw the palace he had built around his isolation . The marble facade , pierced by windows twenty feet high , is Stanford White 's reworking of the front of an Italian Renaissance palace . It is still white and unmarred except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance pillars . Graceful marble cherubs smile in languid peace above the windows , as if time and the hour had not moved in thirty years . The heavy front doors of glass and scrolled iron are locked , and propped up with strong timbers inside . We went in by a side door , whose lock protested against the unfamiliar key . The library is filled with axes , wheelbarrows , and red lanterns belonging to the firm that will reconstruct the interior . High ceilings , wide , deep fireplaces , and elaborately carved mantels are characteristic of the house . There are many strange and unique rooms : a tall , circular breakfast room , an enormous dining-room whose six pairs of windows to the west are made of curved glass in panes more than four feet square , a squash court with a gallery in which we had to light matches to see anything at all . There are three floors in front and eight in back , counting mezzanines . The bathtubs are the high , clumsy monstrosities of their day , except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a washbasin two feet higher than any we ever saw and a specially made combined toilet seat and magazine rack . On one faded wall a card gave the telephone number of the Pulitzer residence when it was alive : Lenox 1734 . There is n't even any such exchange any more . Turtle Facts SOMETHING we printed has reminded a gentleman of a dialogue he overheard one afternoon at the Bronx Zoo . An insistent woman had drawn a keeper into conversation , lively only on her part , about the great big turtles in the turtle house . " Are they very prolific ? " she demanded . She obviously had gone beyond the range of the keeper 's vocabulary with this , but he felt he had to say something . " Well , we feed them three times a week , " he said . The lady let it go at that . Business As Usual WHEN marching men , Austria , WHEN officers , bystanders , and innocent horses got into that milh in front of the Public Library last week , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the surge of the crowd . It was just after a policeman had knocked down an old lady , or something : the crowd had booed , more blows had been struck , and the cops suddenly urged their reluctant and sensitive mounts into the mass of people . In the quick , panicky retreat that followed , our gentleman sought sanctuary by plunging to-ward the revolving door of the Rogers Peet store at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-first Street . He jammed into it at the same moment that three other men did and their impact caused the door to collapse . Push-ing and shouting , the trapped men final- ! ) , forced their way inside the store . A small , neat clerk stepped quickly up to our panting refugee . " Have you been waited on ? " he asked , briskly . " Why , no , " said our friend . " I  --  I would like to look at some shirts . " The clerk led him to the counter where the shirts were . Our friend bought nine dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth a few moments of your time . By day he sells insurance , and nobody pays much attention to him . By night he is a commanding personality , who may be anywhere from one end of the town to the other , directing rehearsals of plays in neighborhood halls or church auditoriums . He has directed more plays than anybody on Broadway , although he 's strictly an amateur . He occasionally goes as far as Connecticut to put the finishing touches on some production , and once he went down to Elizabeth , New Jersey , when some students there said they could n't make any sense out of " A Midsummer Night 's Dream . " Sometimes he covers three or four rehearsals in one evening , if they are in the same neighborhood , and on one occasion he directed two rehearsals at the same time . This was in an East Side gymnasium . He went there to oversee a production of " Hamlet , " and things were going so bad he did n't want to leave to go down to a church auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put " Peter Pan " in shape . So he sent for the " Peter Pan " cast and put them at the other end of the gym and divided his attention between the two . Frost 's first name in full is Solomon , but he 's pure Celtic . He has never made much money out of his work , and he 's been mixed up in amateur theatricals since he was a boy . He is duly proud of having coached Al Smith fo'r his first stage appearance . This was in 1889 , when he was directing the players at St. James 's Church . Smith 's first part , he told us , was that of a little Negro girl who rushed on the stage , following an offstage whine , and said , " Mom , Mom , there 's something wrong with the baby ! " The play was called " May Blossom . " We checked With Al Smith on this , and he said , " Yes , it 's true . Anything Sol says is right . " Frost says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coached the players at St. James 's for nineteen years , the St. Jean-Baptiste players for twenty-six years . Most churches around town call him in in emergencies , and there are hundreds of Frost-coached grownups who demand his services when their children get in tight places . Just now , Frost is suffering from a physical breakdown as a result of a harrowing experience in Brooklyn . This is what that was : The Supreme Court justices over there were pained at the sloppy way the attendants said their lines in the courtroom . When a witness was being sworn , all you 'd hear would be a mumble ending " swepmegawd . " And so on . Last October , the judges held a meeting and decided to do something about it . Justice Cuff , who had been coached by Frost in his youth , said , " Get Sol . He 'll fix it . " Frost obtained a leave of absence from his insurance job and started coaching the court attendants in the daytime . He worked out whole sheets of instructions , containing lines such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Persons in this courtroom pause be seated . " The swearing ritual concluded with a pause between every word . For seventy-five solid days , Sol wrestled with threescore Brooklyn criers , and then had his well-earned breakdown . For twenty or thirty years , Sol thought about becoming a professional actor , but he does n't any more . A few years ago , he persuaded a Brooklyn theatre man to cast him as Polonius in " Hamlet , " and the Brooklyn Eagle dramatic critic said he was terrible . ? NE of our writer friends was go- ing down a corridor in the executive offices of a Hollywood movie studio when , through an open door , he overheard one sentence of a conversation , just this one sentence and nothing more : " I assure you , Mr. Selznick will show Queen Victoria every consideration . " He hopped a plane at once , arriving in our office with the news in a very little over nineteen hours . Bitters Sees-et SINCE Angostura Bitters were first 1 ? -7 manufactured , a hundred and ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the drink is made . Only three of these men are now alive , but there 's nothing to worry about , as you shall see . One of the three conspirators came to town not long ago  --  Mr. Alfredo Galt ) Siegert  --  and we met him one night . The romance of his bitters has its interest . He told us the whole story , beginning with Dr. Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert , who was an army surgeon from Silesia in the wars against Napoleon and who in 1820 roved to Venezuela , where he fought for Simon Bolivar . Needing something to tone him up in a climate he found enervating , he got to experimenting with roots and herbs and barks , and in 1824 hit on something pretty fine . He called it Amargo Aromatica , and it is exactly the same now as it was then except for the name . Angostura Bitters are made of rum and alcohol and eighteen different kinds of roots mid herbs and barks , but just what these are and how they are put together is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brother-in-law . Old Dr. Siegert , a hundred years ago and more , shipped some of his concoction to England and got so many orders for bottles of it that he went into the business , finally taking a son in on the secret . That son later took a brother in , and then they took their sons in , and so on . Since 1875 , the hitters have been made in Port of Spain , Trinidad , in a room beyond a mystic door painted blue . Only the three conspirators are in the room when a batch of bitters is brewed . They dance around a caldron , probably , like the three witches in " Macbeth , " tossing in the ingredients at the right moments . It takes eight months to make Angostura Bitters . " After the first four months , we do different things for the next four months , " Mr. Siegert told us in a burst of confidence . Fifty workers at the Trinidad plant fill the bottles and pack the cases . Thirty thousand cases are turned out every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . The rest is shipped all over the world , except to the United States . Our share of Angostura is made in , of all unromantic places , Jersey City . The Jersey plant was established in 1930 , and twice a year since then one of the three secret-holders has travelled to jersey City to make the bitters . He works in a prosaic-looking room behind an ordinary , mouse-colored door . He stays only a couple of months , instead of eight , because only an Angostura concentrate is made in Jersey . It does n't take as long , but is exactly the same as the regular product when alcohol is added . Do n't ask us why they do n't turn out the concentrate instead of eight months ' brew in Trinidad , too , and save time . We asked Mr. Siegert and his answer got so complicated after a while  --  points involving climate , packing , shipping , duties , etc. ? that we could n't follow him . Now that repeal is here , it is expected that thirty thousand cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you that the formula for Angostura Bitters was never written down , but that is n't true . There are two copies of it , one in a Trinidad bank and one in a London bank . In the case of the death of all three secretecrs , these formulas will he turned over to the authorized successors in the business . Mr. Alfredo Siegert has a son of nineteen , who will be the next person let in on the secret  --  when one of the three present owners dies . In the Trinidad plane , there is a showcase containing more than a hundred imitations of Angostura picked up all over the world ( most of the fakes are made in Germany ) . Since the eighteen-thirties , about three hundred different imitations have been put out , often baldly under the name of An gostura . The Siegerts always sue and drive the fakers out . The company makes another liquor , Siegert 's Bouquet Rum . It 's a good rum they 've been making for sixty-eight years , but it 's sold only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of G. M.-P . Murphy &; Company , 37 Thread-needle Street , London , has written us about a luncheon held at the Hotel Victoria over there by the American Chamber of Commerce in London . Sir Walter Layton spoke on " The Dollar Experiment " and our informant , who was there , was apparently not entirely absorbed in Sir Walter 's remarks , for his eyes strayed to the two flags draped above the speakers ' table , the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes . He counted the stars in our flag , idly , and then counted them again , and then counted them again . After the luncheon , he sort of casually sidled up to the flag and , at close range , counted them again . He had been right : there were just exactly forty-five stars in the field of blue .
