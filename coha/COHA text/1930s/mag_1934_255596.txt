WINE FROM THESE GRAPES-Edna St. Vincent Millay-Harper ( $2 ) . <P> NOT MINE TO FINISH-Genevieve Taggard-Harper ( $2 ) . <P> <P> Sappho was thought unladylike not so much because of her personal habits as because of the poetry she wrote . But Sappho has many a sister in these westering years . Since poets generally discarded their priestlike function for that of self-mindreaders , women have flocked to join the profession and some of them have gone to the head , or near it , of their respective specialties . Last week two U. S. lady poets , whom repute places high above the ruck of feminine poetasters , smote their lyres in unison . <P> As usual , hurrying U. S. citizens paused to give ear to Poet Edna St. Vincent Millay . Some were impressed by Publisher Harper 's proud announcement that two editions of her book had been exhausted before publication date , but many more looked forward to drinking in another recital of carefully muted chamber music . Many a reverent reader , mindful of the Olympian thunders her Fatal Interview brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience . But plain readers soon discovered that Wine from these Grapes was a good but by no means a great performance . <P> Such readers are often made uneasy by the linguistic vagaries of contemporary poets . But Edna St. Vincent Millay is still a lucid poet . Though it is a modern belief that poets , to be audible at all , must speak in an original voice . Poet Millay 's originality lies not in a surprisingly exact vocabulary but in the fainter , pleasanter flavor of language reminiscent of poetry-at-large . Though her studied verse sometimes sounds too consciously traditional , such classic artifice as the following will have charm for most readers : <P> <P> Oh , what a shining town were Death <P> Woke you therein , and drew your breath , <P> My buried love ; and all you were , <P> Caught up and cherished , even there . <P> Those evil windows loved of none <P> Would blaze as if they caught the sun . <P> <P> Woke you in Heaven , Death 's kinder name , <P> And downward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , <P> Then Heaven would be my native land . <P> <P> But you are nowhere : you are gone <P> All roads into Oblivion . <P> Whither I would disperse , till then <P> From home a banished citizen . <P> <P> A poet but a lady poet , Edna St. Vincent Millay writes not only valentines but epitaphs in lines less mighty than aristocratic . Even when she compares a woman 's breasts to wild carrot and onion blossoms or describes the mating of dinosaurs , she contrives to make neither an uncouth nor an arresting gesture . At the sight of a new sonnet sequence critics may hitch up to their typewriters and look for unstruck keys , but ordinary readers will prefer Poet Millay 's less pretentious quatrains : <P> <P> Man , with his ready answer , <P> His sad and hearty word , <P> For every cause in limbo , <P> For every debt deferred , <P> <P> For every pledge forgotten , <P> His eloquent and grim <P> Deep empty gaze upon you , - <P> Expect no more from him . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
