There was an unusually big morning audience at Manhattan 's Palace Theatre one day last week . When 200 of them failed to leave after the first show , the management learned what was up . The 200 were jobless musicians from Local 802 , biggest branch of the American Federation of Musicians . They had come well-supplied with cigarets and sandwiches and prepared to stay in their seats until RKO Service Corp . should agree to hire two movie-house orchestras for its theatres in each of New York 's five boroughs . By the time they had seen the fifth run of the Palace 's double feature , many of Local 802 were asleep . Others massed in the men 's room to eat , smoke and converse . Somebody connected with the theatre turned off a water-cooler . A musician called up the Board of Health and had it turned back on . RKO , however , made no promises . At 2:45 a. m. most of the musicians had gone home . <P> Trivial as the Palace episode was , it pointed up the plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these many years by records and sound-films . This week , when delegates from all 350 A.F.M. locals assembled in Louisville for their national convention , they began to put their case before the nation . Main purpose of the convention was to decide what might be done about " canned " music . Boss James C. ( " Mussolini " ) Petrillo of the Chicago chapter was out to make national the ban on recording which he enforced locally on union men last winter ( TIME , Jan. 4 ) . A.F.M. 's President Josephs Weber of New York may have doubted the wisdom of such drastic action but his hand was being forced . When election of national officers of the A.F.M. is held , Chicago 's Petrillo will make a strong challenge for the national presidency , held by New York 's Weber since 1900.
