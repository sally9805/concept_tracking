txt Peculations and improper diversion of city revenues amounting to $231 , - 334.67 from May , 1929 , to May 8 , 1930 , were stopped through investigations launched by James A. Higgins , Commissioner of Accounts , according to his latest report to Mayor Walker , which was brought to light yesterday . In addition to reporting the exact amounts saved , for the city Mr. Higgins said he had ended the annual leakage of large amounts by revising the auditing and accounting methods of the departments and offices he investigated . Some of the inquiries mentioned in his last report are still going on , and will be included in his next reports , due in about two months . The annual report of his office is separate from the individual reports he is expected to make to Mayor Walker on the departmental inquiries ordered by the Mayor ; Mr. Higgins reported to Mayor Walker that $65,245.25 of the $231 , - 334.67 outgo he stopped had come from the office of the New York County Clerk . Three employes guilty of peculations there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District Attorney . Another saving of $57,868.58 was said to have been effected through the collection of unpaid taxes of 2 per cent on the business of foreign fire insurance companies established in this city . Aided Firemen 's Pension Fund . Mr. Higgins reported that he had had a bill introduced in the Legislature giving the Fire Department Pension Fund an increase of about $100 , - 000 a year in its revenue . The money was formerly paid to the Exempt Volunteer Firemen 's Associa.tion of New York City , composed of members who served before the citypaid Fire Department was established . In 1929 the Fire Department paid to this association $100,399.34 under requirement of the City Charter and Mr. Higgins listed that amount as a saving to the city for future years . The last saving resulted-from the discovery of a shortage of $7,821.50 in the Fourth District Municipal Court , Brooklyn . Information concerning this shortage and the persons involved was sent to the Kings County District Attorney by ' Mr. Higgins . Declaring that the office of the Commissioner of Accounts had reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his report , Mr. Higgins said not one penny of the $231,334.67 would have been recovered if it had not been for the efficiency with which his inquiries were conducted . Since the peculations in the County Clerk 's office amounted to about $30,000 a year during 1927 , 1928 and Part of 1929 , he took . credit for stopping an annual leakage of that amount , which he said would have gone on indefinitely . He also reported that he had made twenty-five specific recommendations for changes in the auditing system of the office , which had been adopted . With that reorganization he . said not a penny of the revenues would go astray . Predicts Other Recoveries . " An additional recovery of several thousands of dollars must , result , " he said , " from my investigation of the New York County Clerk 's office for the reason that , under the reorganization effected by me , the revenue of the Photostat Bureau of that office has increased at least 100 per cent and the mysterious disappearance of $42,187.50 worth of notarial certificates , discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , this investigation by the Commissioner of Accounts , in addition to resulting in the recovery of the specific sum of $65,245.25 , has also rendered impossible an , annual loss of possibly $50,000 . " Concerning the $57,868.58 recovered in back payments of the 2 per cent tax on the business of foreign fire insurance companies , Mr. Higgins said the arrears extended from one to eight years . After investigation he said the money collected was turned over to the Fire Department Pension fund , and the system under which it had formerly been collected was entirely revised to bring about an annual increase of many thousands of dollars in revenue . As any offshoot of this investigation , the Commissioner of Accounts reported that he had inquired into the financial - condition of one of the beneficiaries tof this 2 per cent tax , the Exempt Volunteer Firemen 's Association of-the Former City of New York . He found that this organization , with  --  less'than ten members and about 100 other beneficiaries , had about $500,000 , available for pensions . Under the law the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the proceeds of the 2 per cent tax . Mr. Higgins introduced a bill to have this money paid to the Fire Department pension , fund- , instead , and the bill was enacted into law by the Legislature last year . The change means that the deficit in the pension fund will be reduced by at least $100,000 this year and in future years , he said . Lists Accounting Changes . Reorganization of the auditing and accounting methods of several other city departments was listed by Mr. Higgins as another major accomplishment of his office during 1929-1930 . He specified the Bureau of Water Register in Queens County , saying that loose auditing there had resulted in a loss of money to the city and undue delays in receiving the money collected . Through a new auditing plan the revenues have been increased and the bureau has been made to cooperate with the Bureau of Buildings and the Bureau of Highways . In addition the recording of frontage and meter revenues in all five boroughs was ordered resumed . Commissioner Higgins found that " this phase of accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer of the collection of such revenues to the Collector of City Revenue . " Additional savings to the city were effected , Mr. Higgins reported , through installation of a new accounting system in the Department of Public Welfare , which had lacked a proper system of accounting for some of its cases since 1925 . The staff of the Commissioner of Accounts also surveyed the accounting methods of the Sanitation Department , newly formed at that time , with particular attention to the pension system of the old Street Cleaning Department . The new system provides proper control over the large amounts of money spent for this department 's supplies , Commissioner Higgins said ' . The quality of work done by city paving contractors in the various boroughs west checked up by Mr. Higgins and brought to the attention of Controller Charles , W. Berry . In cases where the contractor failed to live up to his specifications , he was forced to accept reductions in his contract price and was also compelled to extend the period for which he guaranteed to maintain the pavement . Other activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire mesh " of questionable strength " in a large concrete sewer and the breakdown of $80,000 worth of special-body street cleaning trucks bought by the Queens Borough President . Mr. Higgins charged that the chief engineer of the Queens Bureau of Highways had certified paving contractors ' payments to the Controller on the ground that the work was satisfactory , when tests by the borough laboratory itself disclosed that the work was below specifications . Through bringing these conditions before the Controller , Mr. Higgins said he had saved money for the taxpayers and had corrected the evils in each instance . Recommendations that paving specifications be made uniform fez- all boroughs were made by Mr. Higgins after this investigation . He reported that the discrepancies in these specifications were " an open invitation to contractors to do poor work and to build weak pavements . " He also undertook the standardization of paving specifications for the Park Departments in the five boroughs . All complaints received against the activities of city marshals were carefully investigated , Commissioner Higgins said . He suggested to the Mayor that an official code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn up , panting out that there was not sufficient uniformity in the way marshals handled their work and the Municipal Court code was not effective In prohibiting " certain activities by marshals which are in themselves improper , subversive of law and order and unfair to the public . " Periodic audits of eleven county offices were made in the period covered by the report . Other audits were made of thirteen city departments , and three courts were audited . The new plans of auditing introduced in the offices of the County Clerk , Register , Sheriff and ' Public Administrator have been so devised that the slightest diversion of funds will be noticed immediately , Mr. Higgins said . Despite the , wide activity of his office Mr. Higgins said its expenses were less than the amount appropriated by the Board of Estimate for a single new bureau in the Finance Department . The 1930 budget for the entire office of the Commissioner of Accounts was $344,660 . Since that time , however , Mr. Higgins has increased his staff to handle the additional inquiries requested by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
