" Something Like Ballyhoo " <P> Sirs : <P> You probably are n't aware of it but for over a year now I 've been carrying on a passionate single-handed crusade to have TIME restored to the University of Pennsylvania Library which discontinued its subscription at that time . A colleague of mine told me the reason TIME was not subscribed to any more by the U. of P. Library was because it was too popular with the students ( your magazine is used quite extensively in several Wharton School courses ) . <P> I protested to the Periodical Chief ( and Buyer ) telling her I could understand the Library 's discontinuing its New Yorker &; Vanity Fair subscriptions but as for its TIME discontinuation , goodness , no , never ! Her excuse was that the Library had so many research periodicals to subscribe to that it just could n't see how it could afford to subscribe to TIME . <P> Not satisfied with this gossamer explanation , I asked to be shown in black and white just how TIME was inferior to The Literary Digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribe . The Digest , I argued , merely showed scissors whereas TIME showed a much finer pair of shears . Her reply here was that TIME was " a smart-alecky and a funny magazine-something like Ballyhoo ! " <P> I felt like shutting up and retiring to a cave after that ; but , walking away , I promised her that if I were ever an opulent alumnus , I 'd contribute a subscription of TIME to the Penn Library . She agreed that was all right . <P> J. H. POLLACK Philomathean Society University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pa . <P> Outrageous <P> Sirs : <P> For many years we have been faithful readers of TIME . The picture of the President and Mrs. Roosevelt embracing one another in the March 26 issue was , in our estimation , outrageous . TIME has every right to give its readers real news and real pictures , but some discretion should be shown when our popular Chief Executive and his wife are being photographed . The wife of a gangster is usually seen kissing her husband through bars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ osculation . The President and First Lady are in too high a position-a world famous position-to be thus shown in any magazine . <P> TRISTAN HEARST BURTON JAMIESON JR . Brown University Providence , R. I. <P> " Massacrez Tous " <P> Sirs : <P> Your March 19 story of M. Chiappe 's garbled telephone conversation and the la rue-dans la rue misunderstanding , which resulted in French troops opening fire upon Paris civilians , brings to my mind a curiously parallel story which was widely circulated after the coup d ' tat of Napoleon III . According to some historians the massacre of the boulevards resulted from a mistaken command . The official responsible for the fatal order ( perhaps Napoleon himself-I forget the exact details ) is said to have been suffering from a severe cold , and to have exclaimed " Ma sacr toux ! " - " My wretched cough " - which was misinterpreted by a zealous officer as " Massacrez tous , " or " Kill everybody . " <P> Perhaps the recent occurrence is a coincidence , or perhaps French officialdom clings conservatively to old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
