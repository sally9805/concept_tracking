txt Denouncing the county and borough ticket picked by the New York County Republican Executive Committee as a " partisan ' Republican ticket , " the Citizens Non-Partisan Committee , which is headed by Samuel Seabury , pledged itself yesterday to work for the election of a non-partisan Fusion slate . At a meeting late yesterday afternoon in the City Club the Seabury group formally approved candidates previously picked by its executive committee : Mayor La Guardia for Mayor , Joseph D. for Controller , Newbold Morris for President of the City Council , Stanley Isaacs for Manhattan Borough President and William C. Chanler for New York County District Attorney . In so doing it put itself on record as flatly opposing the selection by the Republicans of Irving Ben Cooper , Independent Democrat , for the nomination for District Attorney . Also , Mr. Seabury explained after the meeting , his . group disapproved of some of the individuals designated by the Republicans for the City Court bench . May Name Full Ticket His committee , Mr. Seabury said , would work for the election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained , was empowered at the meeting to take whatever action it thinks necessary to assure the putting of a " true reform " ticket headed by Mayor La Guardia in the field . To this end , it was explained , the executive committee may , if it thinks best , put a complete reform slate in the field as independent candidates after the primaries . There was no indication yesterday whether or not Mayor La Guardia had decided definitely to enter the Republican primaries . Mr. Simpson had not been informed , but had , nevertheless , begun the distribution of nominating petitions for the Mayor . The Seabury group , guarding against the possibility that the Mayor may decide not to enter the primaries , authorized its executive committee to withdraw support from any candidates it has endorsed who do not follow the Mayor 's lead in such a step . " It is my understanding , " Mr. Seabury said in this regard , " that and ' Morris will not run on the Republican ticket if the Mayor is not On the ticket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Told of this , Mr. Simpson pointed out that both Mr. and Mr. Morris have already accepted Republican designations and have clearly indicated their intention to go into the primaries seeking the party nominations . " If we do n't get Republican Fusion , then we are free to nominate a new ticket , " Mr. Seabury said after the meeting of his committee . " The Simpson ticket is a partisan Republican one . We ( the executive committee ) recommended Mr. Chanler and we think he should be nominated and we also thinlz there should be changes in the City Court judges . " A resolution adopted by the committee charged that the Republicans had picked their slate without conferring with " other Fusion " groups and that since the interests of the city require the nomination and election of non-partisans of " high character " to the county and borough offices , the various Fusion groups take the necessary steps to secure " the nomination and election of such a nonpartisan ticket in New York County . " Chairman Simpson contended that his ticket is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not object. : Mr. Cooper , he held , is a far stronger candidate than Mr. Chanler would be . " I have understood and still am of the impression that Judge Seabury 's committee , the Mayor and all the Fusion groups are in complete agreement on the following ticket : La Guardia for Mayor , for Controller , Morris for President of the Council and Isaacs for President of the Borough of Manhattan , " he said , " and that the only disagreement , if there be one ? so far as the elements of the Fusion movement are concerned  --  is on the nomination* of a District Attorney for New York County . In this connection the Republican County Committee has designated an independent Democrat of the highest standing , who would , in the opinion of the committee , make a far better candidate for District Attorney than Mr. Chanler , who is completely without experience in the field of criminal investigation and prosecution and . is altogether unknown to the general public . " Judge Seabury has said : ' The Simpson ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guardia , Dr. and Irving Ben Cooper could , by no stretch of the imagination , be called partisan Republicans . " I have been willing at all times and am still eager to confer with the Mayor 's Non-Partisan Citizens Committee and had hoped to have had the privilege of doing so today , but this opportunity was not accorded to me . I still believe that all of us who are vitally interested in the cause of good government can cooperate , as I have always been willing to do . " " Do you know if the Mayor will be a candidate in the Republican primaries ? " he was asked . " I have no further information on that subject than has already been published , " was the reply . " I sincerely hope and have every reason to believe that he will be . " As proof of his belief Mr. Simpson pointed out that nominating petitions for the Mayor were distributed yesterday to party workers who will seek the signatures of enrolled Republicans for them . Only the Mayor 's name appeared upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Morris and a third Mr. Cooper , Mr. Isaacs and the rest of the county and borough slate . The committee for filing vacancies listed on the Mayor 's nominating petition consist of Mr. Simpson , William M. Chadbourne and Victor F. Kaufmann , all of Manhattan ; Mrs. May M. Gooderson of Brooklyn and Sheriff John Timlin of Richmond . It was noted that with three Manhattan Republicans among the five Mr. Simpson will be able to substitute the name of another candidate of his choosing in case the Mayor declines the nomination . Messrs . Simpson , Chadbourne and Kaufmann constitute the committee on vacancies on the other two nominating petitions . Nominating petitions for Charles G. Bond , who is seeking the Republican Mayoralty designation with the backing of a Brooklyn organization group headed by Elections Commissioner Jacob A. Livingston , will be put out today , it was learned . The committee on vacancies for this anti-La Guardia candidate will be former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Callaghan of Brooklyn , Paul Zizelman of Manhattan , Raymond Richmond , chairman of the Queens Republican finance committee ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Richmond County Republican chairman . The Bond primary cam- , paign will be carried on with vigor I in all five boroughs , it was learned . Mayor La . Guardia yesterday continued silent on the question of entering the Republican primaries . Over the week-end , it was learned , several of his political advisers urged- him to enter , holding that even if he made the fight for the nomination and lost he would ' gain prestige . Those holding this belief argue that the Mayor , known as a foe of machine politics , would lose little strength with the voters by being defeated by a machine . They believe , on the contrary , that the harm done by the defeat would be more than offset by the Mayor 's opportunity to say in the campaign while running as an independent that machine politicians brought about the defeat . This , the advisers feel , would make him stronger than ever with the mass of the voters . Y                  @ @ @
