txt Postoffice Injustice Seen . Since you published the letter of " Substitute " protesting against the new practice of the Postoffice Department in employing temporary help to avoid appointing to regular positions those on the civil service list the lot of the substitutes , precarious at best with the rise in the cost of living , has been steadily growing Worse . What reason induces our government to employ temporary help at the expense of men whose earnings during the last few years have been barely enough to keep them from starvation ? If increase in business compelled the authorities to hire extra help in the nonholiday rush period , fairness should have dictated the appointment of those on the eligible list for regular positions . The poor temporary employes , learning that their own earnings come from the cutting . down of those of their fellows , feel almost ashamed of themselves , though no one blames them for trying to earn a few dollars . It is the government that should blush . JUSTICIAR . New York , Oct , 31 , 1934.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
