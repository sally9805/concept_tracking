ANGEL P A V E M E N Tvoice . " Well , we can try , sir . But it wo n't be easy . We 're spending as little as we can , here in the office . " " Dash it all , Smeeth , I know that . " Mr. Dersingham rubbed his cheek irritably . " But we shall have to spend less . I do n't want to do it  --  I want to do the decent thing by everybody here  --  but you see how it is , do n't you ? Must cut something down . Now look here , to begin with , there 's Turgis . What 's he getting ? A hundred and seventy-five , is n't he ? And Miss Matfield ? We started her at three pounds a week , did n't we ? " " That 's right , Mr. Dersingham . It was less than she 'd been getting before , but she said she 'd start at that with us , and then we 'd see about giving her a rise when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very capable girl , very capable , and very intelligent , too , much better than the last we had ; no comparison at all . " " And Turgis ? What about him ? " " I ca n't really grumble , sir , " replied Mr. Smeeth . " He does his best . He 's a bit careless sometimes , I 'll admit , and he 's not to be trusted far with figures yet  --  you remember the terrible mess he made of the books when I was on my holidays this year ?  --  but as these boys go nowadays , he 's as good as the next . He does n't take the interest in his work and in the firm that I did when I was his age , but then they do n't these days , and that 's all you can say about it . Miss Matfield 's just the same , for that matter . She does her work all right , but she 's not interested , does n't think of herself , you might say , as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does what she 's told to do , and then goes in the evening . " " Thinking about young men , that 's what they are , all these typewriters , " said Goath . " Young men and dancing and going to the pickshers , that 's what 's running in their ' eads , and you ca n't expect anything else of ' em , not in my opinion . Cheeky with it , they are , too . " " Well , I 'm sorry , Smeeth , I really am , but I do n't see anything else for it . One of them will have to go , either Turgis or Miss Matfield . We ca n't spare you , Smeeth  --  " ANGEL PAVEMENT 41 " Thank you , sir . " And as he said it  --  quite simply and not with any touch of irony  --  Mr. Smeeth looked still greyer . Indeed , he shook a little . " No question of it at all , " Mr. Dersingham continued heartily , " absolutely none . But we 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work between us . I 'll do something . I 'll begin to type my own letters . I 'll have a good shot at it anyhow . It 's a question now whether you 'd rather keep Turgis and let him do some of the letters or keep Miss Matfield and divide his work between the two of you . Stanley might do a bit more , too , if he 's got any sense . In any case , we must have a boy , so there 's no question of getting rid of him . Now what d' you think , Smeeth ? Turgis or Miss Matfield ? Nothing much in it , I know , but you ought to decide . You 'll have most of the extra work yourself , I expect , when it gets down to brass tacks , though , mind you , I 'm going to do a lot more myself , if I 've time , in the office . " Mr. Smeeth did not feel quite so bad as he had felt a minute ago , but he felt bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate problem , which was serious enough for him , for he knew very well that it was he who would have to do most of the extra work , but , try as he would , his mind wandered darkly . He could not pretend to himself now that such pitiful economies as these could stop the rot . He had seen it coming for months . The firm , his position , his very living , they were all crumbling away together . The next thing would be that he would have to accept a cut in his salary . And the next thing after that would be finding himself outside , in Angel Pavement , with a hat on his head and no salary , no office , nothing . He hesitated , stammering something , rather painfully . " I did n't want to spring it on you , " said Mr. Dersingham , " and I suppose you 'd really like a day or two to think it over . " " Would n't think a minute if I was you , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , without ' esitation . They never should have started girls in the City . The place has never been right since . Powderin ' noses ! Cups o ' tea ! You do n't know where y'are. " 42 ANGEL PAVEMENT " I would like to think it over , Mr. Dersingham , " Mr. Smeeth told him slowly . " I do n't want to get rid of the wrong one . " " I 'd like to get it settled to-day while we 're at it , but you think it over between now and five o'clock , and then we 'll have another talk about it . All right then . " And Mr. Dersingham examined his notes again , and then looked very severe . " The next thing is this question of what-d'you-call-it  --  these rotters who wo n't pay up . You 've made out a statement , have you ? " But there was a knock at the door , and Stanley sidled in , a card in his hand . " Somebody wants to see you , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " He examined the card . " Never heard of this chap . Look at this , Goath . Anybody you know ? What does he want ? " " Wanted to speak to you , sir , " replied Stanley , looking very mysteriousand important , with a hint of the " shadderer " in his manner . " Very important . That 's what he said . " " I 'll bet he did , " said Mr. Dersingham , with a grin at the other two . " Probably wants to sell me some ridiculous office gadget . If he did , though , he 'd probably have something about it on his card . This is a private card . Golspie , Golspie ? No , I do n't know him . Look here , Stanley , just tell him I 'm having a discussion  --  no , a thingumty  --  a conference , just now , but if it 's something really important , not trying to sell me typewriters and files and muck , I 'll see him soon . He can either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Mr. Golspie decided to wait. vHe was still waiting there , sitting in the little chair beside the door and behind the partition , ten minutes later . Sometimes , Stanley and Turgis and Miss Matfield heard him stir and clear his throat . They also caught the fragrance of the excellent cigar he was smoking . Its fumes seemed to turn the office into a dull little box and their dutiesANGEL PAVEMENT 43into the most mechanical and trivial tasks . There was something rich and adventurous about that drifting luxuriant smoke . It unsettledthem . " Who is he ? " Turgis whispered . " What 's he like ? " Stanley crept nearer and curved a hand round his mouth . " He 's biggish and broad and got a big moustache , " he whispered in reply . " D' you know what I bet he is ? " " No , I give it up . " " Inspector from Scotland Yard . " " You 've got ' em on the brain , you little chump , " said Turgis . " Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betcher . He looks just like one . You go and have a look at him . " But Turgis was saved from the necessity , for the visitor suddenly marched into the office itself . " Where 's that boy ? " he demanded . " Oh , look here , just go in again and tell Mr. What's-it  --  " " Mr. Dersingham , sir , " said Stanley brightly , proud to serve ScotlandYard or anybody who suggested it . " Mr. Dersingham . Tell him I ca n't wait much longer  --  I 'm not used to hanging about like this  --  and that if I go , I go , for good and all , and then he 'll be sorry . D' you get that ? All right then , trot off and speak out . Wait a minute , though . He does n't know what I want , does n't know who I am , so I 'd better show him I 'm not going to waste his time . " He took something out of the small despatch case he was carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample book of veneers and inlays , a few square inches of each specimen wood , thin as cardboard , being fastened to each stout page . " Now give him this , tell him to look it over , and say that 's what I 've come to talk about . D' you understand ? " Having thus despatched the boy , Mr. Golspie stood there at ease , his feet wide apart , his big chest thrown out , coolly enjoying his cigar . It was one of the strictest rules of the place that casual callers were not allowed beyond the partition , and Turgis ought to have44 ANGEL P A V E M E N Tordered him out of the office at once . But somehow Turgis felt that this was not a man to be ordered out of the office by him . " Not much of a place this , I must say , " Mr. Golspie observed , looking about him , then addressing Turgis . " But they keep you pretty busy , eh ? " " Well , they do and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , sometimes we 're busy and sometimes we 're not . It all depends , you see . " I do n't see , but I 'll take your word for it . Must be a dark hole , this , a bit later on , when you get the fogs . Too dark for my taste . Not enough air either . I like plenty of air , though God knows it 's not worth having when you get it , in this neighbourhood . What do they call this street ? Angel Pavement , is n't it ? That 's a dam ' queer name for a street , though I 've known queerer names in my time . How did it get it , d' you know ? " Turgis admitted that he did n't . " Did n't suppose you would , " the stranger told him . " Perhaps this young lady knows . They know everything nowadays . " Miss Matfield looked up . " No , I do n't know , " she replied , with a hint of distaste in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work again . " And I do n't care . " " No , you do n't care , " said Mr. Golspie , bluff , hearty , and completelyunabashed . " I do n't suppose you care tuppence about the whole concern . Why should you , anyhow ? I would n't , if I were a good-lookin ' girl , not tuppence . " Miss Matfield looked up again , this time wearily , wrinkling various parts of her face . Then she brought to bear upon this intruder the full force of her contemptuous gaze , which would instantly have routed Turgis , Mr. Smeeth , or Mr. Dersingham , and a great many other people of her acquaintance . On this objectionable man it had no effect at all . He stared hard at her , and then smiled , or rather grinned broadly . Defeated by such complete insensitiveness , Miss Matfield made a gesture of annoyance , and then went on with her work , without looking up again . ANGEL PAVEMENT 45 " Now what the devil 's that boy doing in there ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go and see if they 've killed him . You need n't , though . He 's coming . " He came , followed by Mr. Smeeth , who said : " I 'm sorry you 've been kept waiting . Mr. Dersingham can see you now . " They waited until they heard the door close behind him before any of them spoke again . " What does he want , Mr. Smeeth ? " asked Turgis . " I do n't know what he wants exactly , Turgis , " Mr. Smeeth replied . " I take it he wants to sell us some stuff . He sent some good samples in ; really first-class Mr. Dersingham and Goath said it was . I do n't pretend to know much about it . But I expect the price will put it out of the question . " " He 's a funny sort of chap , is n't he ? " " A loathsome brute ! " cried Miss Matfield from her machine . " Imagine working for a man like that ! Ghastly ! " Mr. Smeeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get on with his work and if he had n't any work to go and find some , he turned to regard Turgis equally thoughtfully . One of them had to go . Should he put it to them now ? Miss Matfieldwould probably not care very much  --  it was hard to imagine her caring , though she had been anxious enough to get the job  --  whereas Turgis , who had an oldish poverty-stricken father somewhereup in the Midlands , lived in lodgings here in London , and was lucky if he had five pounds in all the world , would be very hard hit and would not easily find another job . It would have to be Miss Matfield . Yet Miss Matfield , who had a good education behind her , was the more promising worker of the two , and would take over some of Turgis 's work and be glad to do it . Well , well , this wanted a bit more thinking about , and , in the meantime , there were a hundred and one little things to be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next half hour , giving no sign of their existence beyond an occasional rumble of voices . At the end of that time , the door opened , louder46 ANGEL PAVEMENT voices and a fresh reek of cigars invaded the general office , and Mr. Dersingham called out : " I say , Smeeth , we 're all going out . Sha n't be back before lunch . I 'll give you a ring if I 'm going to be any later . " And then they were gone , leaving Mr. Smeeth and Turgis staring at one another . The various lunch hours , beginning with Stanley 's ( he went to the Pavement Dining Rooms and had sausage and mash , after all ) , came and went , the afternoon wore on , and still there was no message from Mr. Dersingham or Goath . The crescendo of the last hour of the day , when Stanley turned berserk with the copying press and Turgis snarled at the telephone and then yelled into it , had begun when the message actually did arrive . " Hello ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smeeth ? Dersingham speakin ' . " Even through the telephone , a strangeness , a certain rich- ness , could be remarked in Mr. Dersingham 's voice . He seemed quite excited . " Smeeth speaking , Mr. Dersingham . " " Good , very good . Well , look here , Smeeth , I sha n't be back this afternoon . Nothing important , is there ? You just carry on then  --  and then  --  er  --  you know , finish off , sign anything that wants sign- ing , then finish off , lock up , go home . " " That 'll be all right , Mr. Dersingham . There 's nothing very im- portant . But what about that business we talked about this morning ? Yes , Turgis and Miss Matfield ? " " All done with , " and the telephone seemed to chuckle . " No need to bother about that , not the slightest . Turgis stays . Miss Matfield stays . D' you know , Smeeth , that that girl 's father played scrum half with the Alsations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stays . Both stay . " " I 'm very glad , sir , " said Mr. Smeeth , who really was glad , though perhaps he was mostly puzzled . There seemed to be no sense in all this . " Explain ev'rything in the morning , Smeeth , " continued the voice of Mr. Dersingham . " Only person who goes is Goath . " " What ! I did n't catch that , sir . " " Goath , Goath . We 've done with him . Goath 's finished with . Do n't want to see him again . If he comes for his money , pay him at once , d' you understand , Smeeth , at once , up to end of month . Then tell him  --  to clear  --  right out , right out . " " But  --  but what 's happened , Mr. Dersingham ? I do n't understand . " " Explain ev'rything in the morning . But you understand about Goath , eh ? Pay the blighter off if he comes , finish with him . You understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ol ' man . " Bewildered , Mr. Smeeth laid down the receiver and walked over to his desk . He had hardly time to collect his thoughts and to begin to wonder whether he ought to say something to the others , when the door flew open , almost like a vertical trap-door , to shoot into the middle of the office , where it suddenly stopped dead , the figure of a man . It was Goath . His ancient overcoat was still hanging from his shoulders as if it hardly belonged to him , but , on the other hand , his bowler hat , instead of being at the back of his head , was now tilted forward , giving him an unusual and almost sinister look . His face was purpler than ever ; his eyes were glaring ; and his mouth was opening and shutting , as if he were an indignant fish . To say of Goath that he had been drinking was to say nothing , for he was obviously always drinking , but this time he had plainly had more than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his manner , everything about him , was so extraordinary that everybody in the office stopped work at once to look at him . " Smeeth , " the apparition cried in a thick , hoarse voice , " you pay me my money , d'y'ear . Sala'y to end of mun ' an ' commission to yesserday . I 've finished wi ' Twigg an ' Dersi'am , finished , finishedcom-pletely . " Here he produced a magnificent cutting gesture that nearly upset his balance . " I 've finished wi ' them . They finished wi ' me . All over . " " Mr. Dersingham 's just told me , Goath , " said Mr. Smeeth , looking at him in astonishment . " And I 'll give you your money if you really want it now  --  " 48 ANGEL PAVEMENT " Mus ' ' ave it . Finished  --  com-pletely , com-pletely . " " But what 's happened ? " " I 'll tell you what 's ' appened , " replied Goath with tremendous solemnity , lowering his head so far that it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Golspie , tha 's wha 's ' appened  --  Gol-sss-pie . " " Who 's that ? Do you mean  --  " " Feller came s'mornin ' . " " But what about him ? " Goath now threw back his head and Iooked defiant . " Mister Wha'sit bloody Gol-spie , " he announced with great deliberation , " tha 's the feller . An ' he 's a  --  devil . I tol ' him , I tol ' him Thirry yearsthirryyears  --  in the trade , tha 's me . ' An ' wha ' did he say to tha ' ? Wha ' did he bloody well say ? " " Here , old man , steady , steady , " Mr. Smeeth cautioned him . " Do n't mind me , " said Miss Matfield coolly . " Go on , Mr. Goath . What did he say ? Tell us all about it . " " Never mind wha ' he said , " cried Goath aggressively , glaring round at them all . " Does'n ' ma'er wha " e said . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? With ' is drinks an ' cigars ! All ri '  --  very nice  --  drinks an ' cigars  --  but anybody can buy drinks an ' cigars , an ' do buy drinks an ' cigar and big lunches .

An ' I say  --  wha 's the game ?  --  where 's ' e get this stuff from ?  --  who tol ' ' im to come here ? " " Yes , but what 's this chap doing ? " Mr. Smeeth asked . " That 's what I want to know . " " Bullyin ' an ' twistin ' , tha 's wha " c 's doin ' , " replied Goath promptly , taking off his hat . " An ' he 's got Mr. Dersi'am like tha ' , jus ' like tha ' . " And , to the intense delight of Stanley , one hand fell heavily on the hat . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wha 's it , wha 's it ? " And to show what he did mean , Goath glared harder than ever and then wiggled his fingers in front of his eyes , directing them at Miss Matfield , who let out a sudden peal of laughter . " Hypnotism , " suggested Turgis . " Tha 's ri ' , boy , tha 's ri ' . Hyp-no-tism . Jus ' like tha ' . But not me , " ANGEL PAVEMENT 49he continued , speaking very slowly and more distinctly now , " not me . I tell ' em what I think . Begins tellin ' me I oughter to do this an ' oughter do that , an ' I wo n't ' ave it . I know the trade an ' I speak my mind . An ' another thing . If I do n't like a feller , I do n't like ' im , and that finishes it . That feller comes ' ere , very well , I do n't , I finish . " " Is he coming here ? " demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , Smeeth . I say no more . Finish . You just let me ' ave my money . " " All right , Goath , " said Mr. Smeeth , who had been jotting down some figures for the last minute or two . " I wo n't keep you a minute . Then you 'd better get straight home , old man  --  " " Have no ' ome , " Goath announced . " Lodgings . " He lurched up to the desk , which was high enough for him to rest his elbows on the edge of it . " That 's the way , Smeeth , a nice lil cheque . I tell you , Smeeth , ol ' man , you 've always been decent to me , an ' now I 'm sorry for you . " " Well , I 'm sorry too , Goath , and I must say I do n't understand what 's happening at all . Mr. Dersingham rang up and told me you were leaving . Are you sure it 's not all a mistake ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rather a lot to-day , you know , and in the morning you might all feel different about it . " With an effort Goath stood erect , and then held out his hand to Mr. Smeeth . " No , no , I 've finished . Shake hands , ol ' man . See you again sometime . Meet some day  --  still in the trade , y'know , ca n't change after thirty years  --  have to stick to the trade . Goo ' - bye , all . " And Goath , after removing the dent from his hat with one fierce jab , crammed it on the back of his head and , with a final wave of the hand , departed . " Well , this beats me , " Mr. Smeeth confessed . " I ca n't make head or tail of it , I really ca n't . " " It looks as if that other chap is taking his place , do n't you think ? " said Turgis . " Though I must say he did n't look as if he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too smart and bossy . " " No , I do n't think that 's it , " Mr. Smeeth told him. 5o ANGEL PAVEMENT " Thank the Lord , we 've seen the last of Mr. Goath , anyhow ! " cried Miss Matfield fervently . " I loathed the sight of him , he always looked so dirty and dilapidated . I 'm sure he was a rotten man to have going round calling on people . " " But what if the other chap comes ? " said Turgis , grinning . " You did n't like the look of him , did you ? " " I should think not ! I never thought of that . " She groaned as she stuck another sheet of paper into the typewriter . " What a life ! " " That 's right , let 's get finished . Turgis , Stanley , come on , get a move on , " said Mr. Smeeth sharply . And down below , in Angel Pavement , now a deep narrow pool of darkness sharply spangled with electric lights , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , a final clatter of typewriters , a banging of doors , the hooting of homing cars , the sound of footsteps hurrying up the street towards liberty . Chapter TwoMR . SMEETH IS REASSURED1s/Tx . SMEETH , still puzzling and pondering over the sullen departureof Goath and the arrival of this mysterious Mr. Golspie , put his books away for the night , and , as his habit was , pulled out his pipe and tobacco pouch . The others had gone , and the office was in darkness except for the solitary light above his desk . His pouch , one of those oilskin affairs , was nearly empty , and he had to take out the last crumbs in order to get a decent pipeful . He had just lit up , blown out the first few delicious clouds , and switched off his light , when the telephone rang sharply , urgently , in the gloom . As he groped back to the receiver , he felt almost frightened . What was coming now ? He found himself wishing he had gone earlier , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of mind to ignore the telephone 's peremptory challenge . " Hello ? " he began . A huge voice cut him short , came roaring out of the dark . " Look ' ere , Charlie , what abart makin ' it fifty ? Carm on , yer gotter do it , of son , yer ca n't get away from it  --  " " Wait a moment , " Mr. Smeeth told him . " This is Twigg and Dersingham . Who do you " I know , I know , " the voice continued , smashing its way across London and entirely ignoring Mr. Smeeth 's protest . " I know wotcher goin ' to say , but it 'll ' ave to be fifty this time . I been talkin ' ter Tommy Rawson s'afternoon , an ' ' e says yer 'll be lucky if yer get it at that . Tell Charlie from me , " e says , " e wo n't touch it under fifty an ' ' e'll5152 ANGEL PAVEMENTbe lucky if ' e gets it at that . ' Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree . Nar then , what d'yer say , Charlie ? " " You 've got the wrong number , " cried Mr. Smeeth . " What 's that ? I want Mr. ' Iggins . " " There 's no Mr. Higgins here . This is Twigg and Dersingham . " " Wrong number again , " said the voice , disgusted . " Ring off  --  for gord 's sake . " Mr. Smeeth , relieved , rang off with pleasure , and departed , chucklinga little . Who was Charlie , and what was it he had to pay fifty for , and why did Tommy Rawson think he 'd be lucky if he got it ? " Might easily be crooks , " he concluded . with a little romantic thrill , worthy of Stanley himself , and then smiled at himself . More likely to be fellows buying second-hand cars , loads of scrap iron , or something like that . At the bottom of the stairs , he ran into the tall fellow with the broad-brimmed hat , who was just coming out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning colder . " " Just a bit , " replied Mr. Smeeth heartily . These little encounters and recognitions pleased him , making him feel that he was somebody . " Not so bad , though , for the time of year . " " That 's right . Business good ? " " So-so . Not so good as it might be . " And then Mr. Smeeth let the tall man stride away down Angel Pavement , for he remembered that he was out of tobacco and so turned into the neighbouring shop , the one occupied by T. Benenden . Mr. Smeeth was one of T. 1enenden 's regular customers , a patron ( perhaps the only one ) of T. Benenden 's Own Mixture ( Cool Sweet Smoking ) . " No , " he liked to tell some fellow pipe-smoker , " I do n't fancy your ounce-packet stuff . I like my tobacco freshly mixed , y'know , and so I always get it from a little shop near the office . It 's the chap 's own mixture and so it 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pipeful  --  and very reasonable . Been getting it for years now . And the chap I get it from is a bit of a character in his way . " Saying this made Mr. Smeeth feel that he was a connoisseur of both tobaccoANGEL PAVEMENT 53and human nature , and it gave an added flavour to his pipe , which could do with it after being charged with nothing but T. Benenden 's own mixture . It was hardly possible that he was right about the tobacco being " freshly mixed , " for though mixed  --  and well mixed  --  it may have been , it could not come from T. Benenden 's little shop , with its hundreds of dusty dummy packets , its row of battered tin canisters , its dilapidated weight scales , its dirty counter , its solitary wheezing gas mantle , its cobwebs and dark corners , and still be fresh . On the other hand , he was certainly right when he described T. Benenden himself as a bit of a character in his way . T. Benenden 's way was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldish man who wore thick glasses ( which only magnified eyes that protruded far enough without their help ) , a straggling pepper-and-salt beard , one of those old-fashioned single high collars and a starched front , and no tie . When Mr. Smeeth first visited the shop , years ago , he was at once startled and amused by this absence of tie , jumping to the conclusion that the man had forgotten his tie . Now , he would have been far more startled to see Benenden with a tie . He had often been tempted to ask the chap why he wore these formal collars and fronts and yet no tie , but somehow he had never dared . BenendeR. himself , though he was ready to talk on many subjects , never mentioned ties . Either he deliberately ignored them or he had never noticed the part these things were now playing in the world , simply did not understand about ties . What he did like to talk about , perhaps because his shop was in the City , was finance , a sort of Arabian Nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking his stock away , and peered at old copies of financial periodicals or the City news of ordinary papers , and out of this reading , and the bits of gossip he heard , and the grandiose muddle of his own mind , he concocted the most astonishing talk . It was difficult to buy an ounce of tobacco from him without his making you feel that the pair of you had just missed a fortune . As soon as he recognised Mr. Smeeth , T. Benenden very deliberatelypulled down his scales and then placed on the counter the par-54 ANGEL P A V E M E N Tticular dirty old canister set apart for his own mixture . " The usual , I suppose , Mr. Smeeth ? " he said , picking up the pouch and then smoothing it out on the counter . " I saw your chief this morning , the young fellow  --  Mr. Dersingham . Came in for some Sahibs . Got somebody with him too , new to me , well set up gentleman , with a good cigar in his mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " " He called this morning at the office , " said Mr. Smeeth . " Well , I did n't say anything , " Benenden continued , very seriously as he weighed out the tobacco . " It 's not my business to say anything . I do n't say anything . But I keep my eyes open . And I said to myself , the minute they went out , This looks to me as if Twigg and Dersingham 's are moving on a bit . This has the look of a merging job , or a syndicate job , or a trust job . And , ' I said , if Mr. Smeeth does happen to come in for the usual , I 'll put it straight to him . It 's no concern of mine , but he 'll tell me . I 'll test my judgment , ' I said . " " Sorry , Mr. Benenden , " said Mr. Smeeth , smiling at him , " but I 've nothing to tell you . I do n't rightly know what 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in that line . " " Then , " cried Benenden , quite passionately , rolling up the pouch and then slapping it down on the counter , " you 're wrong . I do n't mean you , Mr. Smeeth , I mean the firm . That 's the way things are going all the time now , Mr. Smeeth , big combinations  --  merging away till you do n't know where you are  --  and sweeping the deck , until  --  dear me  --  there is n't a picking , not a crumb , left . You see what I mean ? Now there 's a bit here in one of the papers  --  I was just readingit when you came in  --  and I do n't suppose you 've seen it . Just a minute and I 'll find it . Now here it is . Suppose , Mr. Smeeth , just suppose , " and here T. Benenden leaned across the counter and his eyes seemed colossal , " I 'd come to you a fortnight since , a week since , and said to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laundries ? '  --  what would you have said ? " " I 'd have said it takes me all my time to pay my own laundry bill , " Mr. Smeeth replied , much amused by this retort of his . ANGEL P A V E M E N T 55T . Benenden made a slight gesture of contempt to show that this was mere trifling . Then he looked very solemn , very impressive . " You 'd have said , I ca n't be bothered with South Coast Laundries . I 'm not touching ' em  --  do n't want ' em  --  take your South Coast Laundriesaway . And you 'd have been right  --  as far as you could see , then . But what happens , what happens ? Read your paper . It 's there , under my very ' and . Along comes a big merger  --  a bit of syndicate and trust work  --  and up they go , right up to the top  --  bang ! Now  --  you see  --  you ca n't touch ' em . And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper  --  who 's been clearing anything out of it  --  a hundred thousand , two hundred thousand  --  a clean sweep , made for life .

We 're missing it , that 's what we 're doing , we 're missing it . " Here , a dramatic pause . " And if your Mr. Dersingham is n't careful , " Benenden concluded , still impressive even if a trifle vague now , " he 's going to miss it . He wants to keep his eyes open . There 's one or two bits in this paper I 'd like to show him . Let 's see , what was it you gave me ? Half a crown , was n't it ? That 's right then  --  one and six change . And goodnightto you , Mr. Smeeth . " And T. Benenden , after stooping down to the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ruminate . Mr. Smeeth made his way to Moorgate , where , as usual , he bought an evening paper and then climbed to the upper deck of a tram . There , when he was not being bumped by the conductor , jostled by outgoing and incoming passengers , thrown back or hurled forward by the tram itself , an irritable and only half tamed brute , he stared at the jogging print and tried to acquaint himself with the latest and most important news of the day . An excitable column and a half told him that a young musical comedy actress , whom he had never seen and had no particular desire to see , had got engaged , that it had been quite a romance , that she was very very happy and not sure yet whether she would leave the stage or not . Mr. Smeeth , not caring whether she left the stage or dropped dead on it , turned to56 ANGEL PAVEMENTanother column . This discussed the problem of careers for married women , a problem that had been left absolutely untouched since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not interest Mr. Smeeth , so he tried another column . This reported an action for divorce , in which it appeared that the petitioning wife had only been allowed a hundred and fifty pounds a year on which to dress herself . The judge had said that this seemed to him  --  a mere bachelor ( laughter )  --  an adequate allowance , but the paper had collected the opinions of well-known society hostesses , who all said it was not adequate . Mr. Smeeth , who found he could not share the editor 's passionate interest in this topic , now tried another page , which promptly informed him that evening gowns would certainly be longer this winter , and then went on to tell him , to the tune of three solid columns , that the modern business girl ( with her latch-key ) had quite a different attitude towards marriage and therefore must not be confused with her grandmother ( Victorian , with no latch-key ) . Mr. Smeeth , feeling sure that he had read all this before , passed on , and arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women golfers were discussed at considerable length . Never having set eyes on any of these Amazons and not being interested in golf , Mr. Smeeth next tried the gossip columns . The tram was swaying now and the print fairly ( lancing , so that it was at the cost of some eye-strain and a slight headache that he learned from these paragraphs that Lord Winthrop 's brother , who was over six feet , intended to spend the winter in the West Indies , that the youngest son of Lady Nether Stowey could not only be seen very frequently at the Blue Pigeon Restaurant but was also renowned for the way in which he painted fans , that the member for the Tewborough Division , who must not be mistaken for Sir Adrian Putter , now in Egypt , had perhaps the best collection of teapots of any man in the House , and that he must not imagine , as so many people did , that Chingley Manor , where the fire had just occurred , was the Chingley Manor mentioned by Disraeli , for it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal , knew them both well . Indeed , he and his editor seemedANGEL PAVEMENT 57to know all about everybody and everything , except Mr. Smeeth and all the other staring men on the tram , and the people they knew , and all their concerns and all the things in which they were interested . Nevertheless , Mr. Smeeth reflected , as he carefully folded the paper , there were a lot of things in it that his wife would like to read . They seemed to have stopped writing penny papers for men . Mr. Smeeth occupied a six-roomed house ( with bath ) in a street full of six-roomed houses ( with baths ) , in that part of Stoke Newingtonthat lies between the High Street and Clissold Park  --  to be precise , at the postal address : 17 , Chaucer Road , N. 16 . Why the late Victorian speculative builder had fastened on Chaucer is a mystery , unless he had come to the conclusion that the Canterbury Pilgrims , who have never vanished from this island , might come to rest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , Chaucer Road , and Mr. Smeeth had once tried his hand at Chaucer , but what with one thing and another , the queer spelling and all that , had not made much of him . All that he remembered now was that Chaucer had called birds " Smally foulies , " and to this day , when he was in a waggish mood , Mr. Smeeth liked to bring in " smally foulies , " only to be countered with " You and your smelly foulies ! ' " from a delightedMrs . Smeeth . Towards 17 , Chaucer Road , Mr. Smeeth now stepped out , swinging his folded newspaper , through the alternating lamplight and gloom , the crisping air , of the autumn evening . Dinner , with a cup of tea to follow , awaited him , for during the week , Mr. Smeeth , like a wise man , preferred to dine when work was done for the day . II " Cut some off for George , " said Mrs. Smeeth , " and I 'll keep it warm for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a bit late yourself tonight , Dad . " " I know . We 've had a funny day to-day , " replied Mr. Smeeth , but for the time being he did not pursue the subject . He was busy carv-58 ANGEL PAVEMENTing , and though it was only cold mutton he was carving , he liked to give it all of his attention . " Now then , Edna , " cried Mrs. Smeeth to-her daughter , " do n't sit there dreaming . Pass the potatoes and the greens  --  careful , they 're hot . And the mint sauce . Oh , I forgot it . Run and get it , that 's a good girl . All right , do n't bother yourself . I can be there and back before you 've got your wits together . " Mr. Smeeth looked up from his carving and eyed Edna severely . " Why did n't you go and get it when your mother told you . Letting her do everything . " His daughter pulled down her mouth and wriggled a little . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whining tone . " Did n't give me time , that 's all . " Mr. Smeeth grunted impatiently . Edna annoyed him these days . He had been very fond of her when she was a child  --  and , for that matter , he was still fond of her  --  but now she had arrived at what seemed to him a very silly awkward age . She had a way of acting , of looking , of talking , all acquired fairly recently , that irritated him . An outsider might have come to the conclusion that Edna looked like a slightly soiled and cheapened elf . She was between seventeen and eighteen , a smallish girl , thin about the neck and shoulders but with sturdy legs . She had a broad snub nose , a little round mouth that was nearly always open , and greyish-greenish-blueish eyes set rather wide apart ; and scores of faces exactly like hers , pert , pretty-ish and under-nourished , may be seen within a stone's-throw of any picture theatre any evening in any large town . She had left school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of various jobs , the latest and steadiest of them being one as assistant in a big draper 's Finsbury Park way . At home now , being neither child nor an adult , neither dependent nor independent , she was at her worst ; languid and complaining , shrill and resentful , or sullen and tearful ; she would not eat properly ; she did not want to help her mother , to do a bit of washing-up , to tidy her room ; and it was only when one of her silly little friends called , when she was going out , that she suddenlyANGEL P A V E M E N T 59sprang into a vivid personal life of her own , became eager and vivacious . This contrast , as sharp as a sword , sometimes angered , sometimessaddened her father , who could not imagine how his home , for which he saw himself for ever planning and working , appeared in the eyes of fretful , secretive and ambitious adolescence . These changes in Edna annoyed and worried him far more than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a solid grievance , and turned a tolerant , sagely feminine eye on what she called Edna 's " airs and graces . " There was a bustle and clatter , and Mrs. Smeeth returned to dump upon the table a little jug without a handle . " I 'm getting properly mixed up in my old age , " she announced , breathlessly . " First I thought it was there , in front of the bottom shelf . Then when I went , I thought I could n't have made any , because it was n't there . And then  --  lo and behold  --  it was there all the time , right at the back of the second shelf . Oh , you 've given me too much , Dad . Take some back . I 'm not a bit hungry somehow to-night , have n't been all day . You know how you get sometimes , ca n't fancy anything . Here , Edna , you want more than that . Well , I dare say you do n't , but you 're going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a girl your age ! Because your mother does n't feel hungry for once in her life , it does n't mean you 're just going to sit there , pecking worse than a little sparrow . " And here she stopped , to take breath , to snatch Edna 's plate and put some more meat on it , to sit down , to do half a dozen other things , all in a flash . According to all the literary formulas , the wife of Mr. Smeeth should have been a grey and withered suburban drudge , a creature who had long forgotten to care for anything but a few household tasks , the welfare of her children , and the opinion of one or two chapel-going neighbours , a mere husk of womanhood , in whom Mr. Smeeth could not recognise the girl he had once courted . But Nature , caring nothing for literary formulas , had gone to work in another fashion with Mrs. Smeeth . There was nothing grey and withered about her . She was only in her early forties , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any standards . She was a good deal plumperthan the girl Mr. Smeeth had married , twenty-two years before , butshe was no worse for that . She still had a great quantity of untidybrown hair , a bright blue eye , rosy cheeks , and a ripe moist lip . Shecame of robust country stock , and perhaps that is why she had beenable to conjure any amount of bad food into healthy and jolly womanhood . By temperament , however , she was a real child of London , adaughter of Cockaigne . She adored oysters , fish and chips , an occasionalbottle of stout or glass of port , cheerful gossip , hospitality , noise , jokes , sales , outings , comic songs , entertainments of any kind , in fact , the whole rattling and roaring , laughing and crying world of food and drink and bargaining and adventure and concupiscence . She liked to spend as much money as she could , but apart from that , would have been quite happy if the Smeeths had dropped to a lower social level . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed rather impatient of them , sometimes openly contemptuous , but she had no contempt , beyond that experienced by all deeply feminine natures for the male , for the man himself . He had been her sweetheart , he was her husband ; he had given her innumerablepleasures , had looked after her , had been patient with her , had always been fond of her ; and she loved him and was proud of what seemed to her his cleverness . She knew enough about life to realise that Smeeth was a really good husband and that this was something to be thankful for . ( North London does not form any part of that small hot-house world in which a good husband or wife is regarded as a bore , perhaps as an obstacle in the path of the partner 's selfdevelopment . ) Chastity for its own sake made no appeal to her , and she recognised with inward pleasure ( though not with any outward sign ) the glances that flirtatious and challenging males , in buses and shops and tea-rooms , threw in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as she frankly confessed  --  she would not have moaned and repined , but would have promptly " shown him " what she could do in that line . As it was , he did not require showing . He grumbled sometimes at her extravagance , her thoughtlessness , herANGEL PAVEMENT 61rather slapdash housekeeping , but in spite of all that , in spite too , of the fact that for two-and-twenty years they had been cooped up together in tiny houses , she still seemed to him an adorable person , at once incredible and delightful in the large , wilful , intriguing , mysteriousmass of her femininity , the Woman among the almost indistinguishablecrowd of mere women . " And if this pudding tastes like nothing on earth , " cried Mrs. Smeeth , rushing it on to the table , " do n't blame me , blame Mrs. Newark at number twenty-three . She came charging in , like a fire brigade , just as I was in the middle of mixing it , and shrieked at me  --  you know what a voice she has ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smeeth ! ' And I said , I 'm sure I do n't know , Mrs. Newark . What is it this time ? ' I slipped that in just to remind her it was n't the first time she 'd nearly frightened the life out of me , breaking the news about nothing . Well , ' she said  --  just a minute , mind your hand , Dad , that 's hot . Pass the custard , Edna . Dad wants it . That 's right . " And Mrs. Smeeth sat down , flushed and panting . " Bit on the heavy side , p'raps , " said Mr. Smeeth , who had now tasted his pudding , " but I 've had worse from you , Mother , much worse . " Another spoonful . " Not so bad at all . " " No , it is n't , is it ? " his wife replied . " But if it is n't , it ought to be . I thought Mrs. Screaming Twenty-three had done it in properly . Well , ' she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Smeeth , I 've had a letter from Albert , and he 's been in hospital in Rangoon , and now he 's all right , and the letter came not ten minutes since : You do n't say ! ' I said . Where 's he been in hospital ? And she said , Rangoo-oon '  --  just like that . Reminded me of that Harry Tate sketch , you remember , Dad ? Rangoo-oon ! I nearly laughed in her face . And talk about sketches ! If you want a sketch you could n't beat this Albert she 's making so much fuss about . ' Member him , Edna ?  --  teeth sticking out a yard , and all cross-eyed . They saw something in Rangoo-oon when they saw Albert . " " Oo , he was sorful ! " cried Edna , shuddering in a refined way . " Still , we ca n't all be oil-paintings , " Mrs. Smeeth remarked philo-62 ANGEL PAVEMENTsophically . Then she looked mischievous . " And we ca n't all look like Mr. Ronald Mawiborough either . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smeeth inquired . " There you are , you see , Dad , you 're not up in these things . You 're behind the times . Matter of fact , you have seen him , ' cos I remember the two of us seeing him together , in that picture at the Empire . " " Oh , one of those movie chaps , is he ? " Mr. Smeeth was obviously more interested in pudding than in movie chaps . " I should think he is . Is n't he , Edna ? " " Oh , do shut up , Mother , " cried Edna , crimson now and wriggling . " What 's this about ? " " He 's the latest , is n't he , Edna ? " said Mrs. Smeeth wickedly . " And I must say he 's a good-looking young fellow  --  curly hair , dark eyes , and all that . Free with his photographs too . Yours sincerely , Ronald Mawiborough , that 's him . Nothing stand-offish about him when he addresses his sweet young admirers  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two imploring eyes in a scarlet face . " That 's what comes of not doing your bedroom out , miss , " her mother retorted . " I go up to her bedroom , Dad , and what do I find ? Mr. Ronald Mawiborough , hers sincerely , on a big photo . You can nearly count his eyelashes . That 's the latest now . Not content with cutting ' em out of these movie papers , they send to Hollywood for them . Darling Mr. Ronald , they write , I shall die if you do n't send me your photo , signed in your own sweet handwriting . Yours truly , Edna Smeeth , seventeen Chaucer Road , Stoke Newington , England . " Mr. Smeeth looked severe . " Well , I must say , Edna , I call that a silly game . " " I only did it for fun , " she muttered , " just to see what would happen , that 's all . Some of our girls have got dozens  --  " " Pity they 've got nothing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , well , they might be doing worse , " said Mrs. Smeeth , risingfrom the table . " It wo n't do them any good , but it wo n't do themany harm either . We 've all been a bit silly in our time . I 'm sure IANGEL PAVEMENT 63was when I was a girl . Girls are a bit silly , if you ask me , and it 's a good job for the men they are . But that does n't mean they ca n't helpto clear a table . Come on , Edna , get these things away while I makethe tea . " " Oh , all ri-ight , " Edna sighed wearily , and rose in slow-motion time . Ten minutes later , after gulping down her tea , she rushed out of the room , leaving her parents sitting at ease , Mrs. Smeeth over her secondcup of tea , Mr. Smeeth over his pipe . The room was small and contained far too much furniture andtoo many knick-knacks . Nearly everything in it was shoddy and ugly , manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , to be bought and exhibited for a brief season by the purchaser , and then to be in the way and finally rot out of the way . Nevertheless , thetotal effect of the room was not displeasing , because it had a cosy , homelike atmosphere , which Mr. Smeeth , whose imagination , heightenedby fear , perhaps told him that outside beyond the firelight and the snug walls were stalking poverty , disgrace , shame , disease , anddeath , enjoyed even more than Mrs. Smeeth . It was probably this feeling , and not so much the strain of the day 's work , that made him a man difficult to rouse and get out of the house in the evening , as his wife , who was all for going out somewhere , or , failing that , inviting somebody in , knew to her cost . " You 're an old home-bird , you are , " she said , with a sort of affectionatecontempt , as she saw him settling deeper now into his chair . " Well , what 's been bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " " I got a real fright this morning , I do n't mind telling you , Edie , " he began . " Not that I had n't seen it coming the way things weregoing on , " he added , with a gloomy pride . " Now then , do n't start on , " she warned him , shaking a teaspoon . " You see too much coming . Always looking into the middle of next week and noticing how black it 's getting . Talk about depressions in Iceland ! They ought to give you the job , and then there 'd be plenty . However , go on , my dear . Must n't interrupt . " 64 ANGEL PAVEMENT " Well , somebody 's got to look , have n't they ? " he replied . " And ifMr . Dersingham had looked a bit harder , we 'd all be better off " " Do you mean to say you wo n't get that rise at Christmas he wastalking about ? " " Rise at Christmas ! I thought this morning I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edie , when he started , my heart went into my boots . " And he plunged into an account of the scene in Mr. Dersingham'sroom that morning and then discussed the mysterious events that followed it , all of which Mrs. Smeeth punctuated with nods and ejaculations , such as " Did he really ? " " Well , I never ! " and , " Silly old geezer ! " She gave him more of her attention than she usually did , because she could see that he was seriously concerned , but at the same time she did not really bother her own head about it , as he knew very well . To her it was all rather unreal , and he was convinced that the idea that he might lose his job , be thrown into the street with only the gloomiest prospect of getting anything half as good , never really entered her head . And this indifference , this childlike confidence in his ability to produce the usual six or seven pounds every week , did nothing to restore his own self-confidence , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him feel that he had to think for two , and in the end left him lonely with his fear . " All I 'm hoping now , " he went on , earnestly , " is that this chap who called has got something up his sleeve . It 's so funny Goath going like that . Looks to me as if this chap , Golspie , thought Goath was n't any good  --  and I 've thought so once or twice myself lately  --  and worked it so that Mr. Dersingham got rid of him . Perhaps he 's going to take his place . I must say , it 's a funny business . In all my experience  --  " " Do n't you worry , it 'll be all right , " cried Mrs. Smeeth . " We 're going to be lucky , we are . I do n't care if Mr. Dersingham goes mental , we 're going to be lucky . Soon too ! I do n't think I told you , but Mrs. Dalby 's sister  --  the one with the fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me my fortune the other afternoon , and she said luck was coming , money and good luck , and all through aANGEL P A V E M E N T 65stranger , a middling-coloured man in a strange bed . Is this man you 're talking about middling-coloured ? " " Do n't ask me , I never noticed what colour-le was . He had n't any colour . He 'd got a big moustache , if that 's any use to you . But what puzzles me is this , why did Mr. Dersingham " Do n't you worry yourself , Dad , why Mr. Dersingham did anything , " his wife interrupted . " Think he 's spending his time worrying about you ? Not him ! And do n't you bother your old head about him , either . Let 's have a bit o ' music . It 'll cheer us up . " She bounced over to the corner in which George , who had a head for these things , had fixed up that tangle of wires which still passes by the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What starts it ? I can never remember , " she said , with one hand hovering over the various knobs . " Is it this thing you pull out ? " It must have been , for she pulled it , and immediately a loud , patronisingvoice filled the room . " Let us turn to anothuh aspect of this problam , " it shouted . " As we have already seen  --  ah  --  a company can not barrow unless it is aixpressly authorised  --  that is , authorised by its memorandum of association  --  ah  --  to do so . Let us see what this invalves . Suppose a companay has been formed for the purpose  --  we will say  --  ah  --  of discounting cammercial bills  --  " " Oh , help ! " cried Mrs. Smeeth , and promptly turned the voice out of the room . " A lot of cheering up you 'll do ! " she told the loud speaker severely . " Look in the paper and see when the singing and playing comes on . " There was a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose , very red about the lips . " Where you 're going , Edna ? " her mother shrieked . " Out . " " Who with ? " " Minnie Watson . " " Well , do n't be late then , you and your Minnie Watson . " A bang of the front door was Edna 's only reply . " It 's Minnie Watson ev'ry night now , " said Mrs. Smeeth . " Next month it 'll be all somebody else. 66 ANGEL PAVEMENTI said to her last night , Where 's Annie Frost now you used to be so friendly with ? ' " " Is that Frost 's girl ? " inquired Mr. Smeeth . " The chap who keeps the Hand and Glove ? " " That 's right , Jimmy Frost . So when I said that to her , the little madam turns up her nose at once and says , Catch me going with Annie Frost ! ' Just like that . And it does n't seem a minute since they were as thick as thieves . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at her age . " " You wo n't make me believe that , " said Mr. Smeeth sturdily . " You 'd more sense . Seems to me these young girls now have n't a scrap of sense . The bit they leave school with is knocked out of them by pictures nowadays . They think about pictures  --  movies and talkies  --  from morning till night . They 're getting jazzed off their little heads . " " That sounds like Georgie , " cried Mrs. Smeeth , starting up . " I 'll go and get his dinner out of the oven . Come on , boy , hurry up if you want any dinner to-night . It 's nearly cinders now . " Left to himself , Mr. Smeeth slowly knocked out his pipe in the coal-scuttle and then stared into the fire , brooding . He was always catching himself grumbling about the children now , and he did not want to be a grumbling father . He had enjoyed them when they were young , but now , although there were times when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . George especially , the elder of the two , and once a very bright promising boy , was both a disappointmentand a mystery . George had had opportunities that he himself had never had . But George had shown an inclination from the first , to go his own way , which seemed to Mr. Smeeth a very poor way . He had no desire to stick to anything , to serve somebody faithfully , to work himself steadily up to a good safe position . He simply tried one thing after another , selling wireless sets , helping some pal in a garage ( he was in a garage now , and it was his fourth or fifth ) , and though he always contrived to earn something and appeared to work hard enough , he was not , in his father 's opinion , getting anyANGELPAVEMENT 67where . He was only twenty , of course , and there was time , but Mr. Smeeth , who knew very well that George would continue to go his own way without any reference to him , did not see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , there was nothing wrong , and his father was well aware of the fact that he could not make him see there was anything wrong . That was the trouble with both his children . There was obviously nothing bad about either of them ; they compared very favourably with other people 's boys and girls ; and he would have been quick to defend them ; but nevertheless , they were growing up to be men and women he could not understand , just as if they were foreigners . And it was all very perplexing and vaguely saddening . The truth was , of course , that Mr. Smeeth 's children were foreigners , not simply because they belonged to a younger generation but because they belonged to a younger generation that existed in a different world . Mr. Smeeth was perplexed because he applied to them standards they did not recognise . They were the product of a changingcivilisation , creatures of the post-war world . They had grown up to the sound of the Ford car rattling down the street , and that Ford car had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a whole load of ideas that seemed still of supreme importance to Mr. Smeeth . They were the children of the Woolworth stores and the moving pictures . Their world was at once larger and shallower than that of their parents . They were less English , more cosmopolitan . Mr. Smeeth could not understand George and Edna , but a host of youths and girls in New York , Paris and Berlin would have understoodthem at a glance . Edna 's appearance , her grimaces and gestures , were temporarily based on those of an Americanised Polish Jewess , who , from her mint in Hollywood , had stamped them on these young girls all over the world . George 's knowing eye for a machine , his cigarette and drooping eyelid , his sleek hair , his ties and shoes and suits , the smallest details of his motor-cycling and dancing , his staccato impersonal talk , his huge indifferences , could be matched68 ANGEL P A V E M E N , Talmost exactly round every corner in any American city or European capital . Mrs. Smeeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , George descended from his bedroom , shining , sleek , brushed . He was better looking , better built , tougher in body , than his father had ever been , and he owed far more to his mother , though there was about her a certain generosity of the blood , a suggestion of ruddy mounting sap , that was absent in him : he was drier , more compressed and blanched ; and though he was a good-looking youth , who moved easily , quickly , he had hardly any more of the bloom of twenty than had the moving pictures of Mr. Ronald Mawlborough and his kind . In short , he looked too old for an English boy of that age . It was as if the Americanised world he had grown up to discover about him , had contrived to introduce into North London the drying and ageing American climate . " You 're late to-night , George , " said his father . " Been busy , " he replied , dispatching his dinner quickly , quietly , efficiently , but with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes ' silence , he continued : " Feller came in with an old Lumbden , twelve horse . Could have had it for fifteen quid . Nothing much wrong with it . Wanted new plugs and mag . and brakes re-liningand something doing to the differential , and just cleanin ' up a bit . All right then . Take you anywhere . Thought once of sellin ' the ol ' bike and having a shot at this Lumbden . " " I wish you would , Georgie , " cried Mrs. Smeeth . " You could take us all out then . See us going out in style , eh , Dad ? Besides , I hate that stinking rattling ol ' bike of yours . Nasty dangerous things they are too .

" " We 'll go down to Brighton and see your aunt Flo , " cried Mrs. Smeeth , her eyes brightening at the thought of an outing . " Now do n't forget , Georgie boy . That 's a promise to your old mother . Do n't go spending all your time taking the girls out in it . Give your mother a chance . She can enjoy a ride as well as the next . " " Righto , " said George briskly . He rose from the table . " Here , you want some pudding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't look it in the face . ' Sides , I have n't time . " " Time ! " cried his mother . " You 're never in . Where you going ? " " Out . " " Out where ? " " Just knocking about with some of the fellers . " Mr. Smeeth looked at him , rather gravely . He felt it was his turn to speak now . " Just a minute , " he said sharply . " What does knocking about ' mean exactly , may I ask ? " At this , George looked a shade less confident , a trifle younger , as he stood there tapping his cigarette . " I du n no . Might do one thing , might do another . Might have a game of billiards at the Institute , or look in at the pictures , or go down to the second house at Finsbury Park . Depends what everybody wants to do . No harm in that , Dad . " He lit his cigarette . " Course there is n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . " " No , I did n't , " said Mr. Smeeth slowly . " That 's all right , George . Only do n't take all night about it , that 's all . Oh !  --  there 's just another thing . " He hesitated a moment . " Somebody told me he 'd seen you once or twice with that flash bookie chap  --  what 's his name ?  --  y'know  --  Shandon . Well , you keep away from that chap , George . I do n't interfere  --  and you know I do n't  --  but that chap 's a wrong ' un , and I do n't want to see a boy of mine in his company . " " Shandon 's no friend of mine , " said George , flushing . " I don't70 ANGEL PAVEMENTknock about with him . He comes into the garage sometimes , that 's all . He 's a friend of Barrett 's . " " Well , if half of what I hear 's true , " Mr. Smeeth remarked , " he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep out of his way , George , see ? " " First I 've heard of this , " said Mrs. Smeeth , looking severely at her son . " All ri ' , Dad , " George muttered , nodding . " So long , Ma . " And he was off . Mrs. Smeeth promptly rushed the remaining dirty plates into the kitchen , and then returned , five minutes later , to find her husband looking at a battered copy of a detective story that had somehow found its way into the room . You could not say he was reading it . So far , he was merely glancing suspiciously at it . Mrs. Smeeth took up the evening paper , pecked at it here and there , then pottered about a minute or two , then turned on the wireless , which only let loose another patronising gentleman , switched it off , brought two socks and some darning wool from the top of the little bookcase , examined them with distaste , looked across at her husband , then said : " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d' you feel about a little walk round ? We might look in at Fred 's for an hour . What d' you say ? Oh no , I thought not  --  wo n't stir , the old stick-in-the-mud . One of these days I 'll be finding a nice young man to take me to the pictures . Well , if you wo n't stir , I will . I think I 'll just slip round to Mrs. Dalby 's for an hour . She asked me if I would . " " You do , " said Mr. Smeeth . " I 'm all right here . " He lit his pipe again , made up the fire , and tried to settle down with the detective story , which at once hustled him into the library of the old Manor House , where the baronet 's body was waiting to be discovered . But he did not make much headway with it . Goath and Mr. Dersingham and this Golspie kept appearing in that library . Angel Pavement was just outside the old Manor House . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the patronising gen- tlemen had all gone home , and in their place was a rich and advenANGELPAVEMENT 71turous flood of sound . It was not unfamiliar to Mr. Smeeth , and , after a pleasant tussle with his memory , he recognised it as something by Mendelssohn , an overture it was , a sea piece , either Whats-It 's Cave or Hebrides or something . Unlike his wife and children and most of his friends , Mr. Smeeth had a genuine , if unambitious , passionfor music , and this was the kind of music he knew end liked best . He sank into his chair , and the sharp lines on his face softened as the music came swirling out of the little cone and there arrived with it the old mysterious enchantment of the ear . A phantom sea rolled about his chair : the room was filled with foam and salt air , the green glitter of the waves , the white flash and the crying of great sea birds . And Mr. Smeeth , a magically drowned man , worried no longer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smeeth struggled out of sleep to find himself faced with one of those dark spouting mornings which burst over unhappy London like gigantic bombs filled with dirty water . At the first sign of the approach of one of these outrages , all clocks ought to be put back three hours , so that everybody might stay in bed until their fury is spent . There is no end to their malice . They sweep , lash , and machine-gun the streets with rain ; they send up fountains of mud from every passing wheel ; they contrive that fires shall not burn and water boil , that tea shall be lukewarm , bacon fat congealed , and warranted fresh eggs change in their very cups to mere eggs and dubious ; they make the husband turn on the wife , the father on the child , and thus help to ruin all family life ; and they lavishly sow all the ills that townsmen know , colds , indigestion , rheumatism , influenza , bronchitis , pneumonia , and are indeed the industrious hirelings of Death . " Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out of bed over an hour , but somehow looked as if her real self was still there , as if this was a mysteriously wrapped wraith of herself she had72 A N G E L P A V E M E N Tprojected downstairs . " Goo ' - bye , then . You 'll have to run for it , Dad . " Dad did not run for it , but he managed to trot down Chaucer Road and then along the neighbouring street , but after that he had a pain over his heart and was reduced to a sort of quick shamble . Before he reached the High Street and his tram , the bottom of his trousers were unpleasantly heavy , his boots ( one of Mrs. Smeeth 's bargains and made of cardboard ) gave out a squelching sound , and the newspaper he carried was being rapidly reconverted into its originalpulp . The tram , its windows steaming and streaming , was more crowded than usual , of course , and carried its maximum cargo of wet clothes , the wearers of which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smeeth succeeded in filling and lighting his morning pipe of T. Benenden 's Own , and then  --  so stubborn is the spirit of man  --  succeeded in unfolding and examining his pulpy newspaper . Before he had reached the end of City Road , he had learned that the cost of a public school education was too high , that the night clubs on Broadway were not doing the business they had done , that a man in Birmingham had cut his wife 's throat , that students in Cairo were again on strike , that an old woman in Hammersmith had died of starvation , that a policeman in Suffolk had found six pound notes in the prisoner 's left sock , and that bubonic plague is conveyed to human beings by fleas from infected rats . And Angel Pavement , when he arrived there , looked as if it had been plucked , grey and dripping , from the bottom of an old cistern . It was an unpleasant morning at the office . To begin with , the situation was more puzzling than ever . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half past ten to say that he would not be there until late afternoon and would Mr. Smeeth " just carry on . " Goath did not reappear , and Mr. Smeeth felt sure now that he had vanished for ever . Then Miss Matfield was haughtier than usual , and very cross . Young Turgis , who had contrived to get wetter than anybody else on his way up to the office , went slouchingA N G E L P A V E M E N T 73about with a long pale face , and every now and then startled and intimidated everybody by sneezing explosively . Stanley , at odds with the weather , the world , and his present destiny , hung about and got in people 's way , and when told to get on with his work , pointed out , not very respectfully , that he had n't any work , and Mr. Smeeth did not find it easy to supply him with any . Several inquiries by telephone could not be properly answered , always an unsatisfactory state of affairs . Mr. Smeeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he felt queerly insecure , not at all happy with his books , his neat little figures , his pencil , rubber , blue ink and red ink , now that he no longer knew what was happening to the firm . It was like trying to post a ledger swinging above a dark gulf . Lunch time found him at his usual teashop , sitting at a wet marbletoppedtable and waiting for his poached egg on toast and cup of coffee . The wet morning had perished outside , where there was even a faint gleam of sunshine , but it had found a haven in this teashop , which seemed to be four hours behind the weather in the street , for it was all damp and steaming . Mr. Smeeth was jammed into a corner with another regular patron , a man with a glass eye , bright blue and with such a fixed glare about it that the thing frightened you . Mr. Smeeth was sitting on the same side as the glass eye , and as the owner of it , who was busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of cold milk , never turned his head as he talked , the effect was disconcerting and rather horrible . " Firm we 've been doing business with , " said the man , disposing of a few beans that had quitted their toast , " has come a nasty cropper  --  a ve-ery nasty cropper . Claridge and Molton  --  d' you know ' em ? Oh , very nasty . " " Is that so ? " said Mr. Smeeth politely , looking from his poached egg at the glaring blue eye and then looking away again . " Do n't think I know the firm . " " No , well , you might n't , " the eye continued , as if it had its doubts about that , though . " But they 've been a well-known house in the74 ANGEL PAVEMENTwholesale umbrella trade for donkeys ' years , specially for ribs , handles , and tips . I remember the time when they carried a line of ribs nobody else could touch  --  same with the tips . If you 'd come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even three years ago , and said , We can offer you a line in ribs and tips that 'll make Claridge and Molton look silly , ' if you 'd said that , we 'd have laughed at you . " " No doubt , " said Mr. Smeeth , quite seriously . " And up to eighteen months ago , I 'd have told you that Claridge and Molton was one of the soundest concerns in the business . And look at ' em now . Properly in Queer Street . Absolutely down the river . " Mr. Smeeth manfully faced the blue glare . " How d' you account for it ? " he inquired , not out of mere politeness but because he really wanted to know . " This milk does n't taste right this morning , " his neighbour remarkedmournfully . " They 've had it near something . I 'm giving it a miss . What was that ? " And here the eye turned balefully . " Oh , about Claridge and Molton . Well , young Molton 's the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years ago , then began staying away all day  --  likes his whisky , y'knowdrewheavily on the firm  --  sacked their oldest man , old Johnny Fowler , for something and nothing . Probably tight at the time  --  young Molton , I mean , not Johnny Fowler  --  he never took a drop . And there you are ! You ca n't do it , y'know , you ca n't do it . Can you ? " " No , " said Mr. Smeeth sadly , " you ca n't . " " Course you ca n't , " the eye concluded . " Not nowadays . It 's all too keen , too much competition . You 've got to watch yourself all the time . Is n't that so ? Eh , miss , miss ! My check , miss . And , I say , what about this milk ? " Mr. Smeeth finished his coffee , mechanically filled and lit his pipe , then pushed his way out of the place . He felt miserable . For all he knew to the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molton . Had n't Mr. Dersingham just startedA N G E L P A V E M E N T 75staying away from the office all day ? Had n't he just sacked their oldest man , Goath ? As he moved slowly along , sometimes staring into the windows of shops that meant nothing to him , Mr. Smeeth found himself going over all the possible ways in which a firm might come a nasty cropper , arrive at Queer Street , go.down the river , and they seemed so numerous , so inevitable , that he saw himselfjoining the wretched army of the hangers-on , the dispossessed , at any moment . And , at the corner of Chiswell Street , he gave a man twopence for a box of matches . When he let himself quietly into the office , he heard loud voices , and thought for a moment that something exciting was happening . But then he caught the words . " I shaddered him all down Victoria Park Road , " Stanley was sayingtriumphantly , " and he never knew . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't know you were following him , you little chump . " " I know he did n't , " cried Stanley . " That 's it . That 's where shadderin ' comes in " " Well , shadowing can come out , " Mr. Smeeth announced . " And if you do n't get on with some work , my boy , you 'll be finding yourself shadowing down those steps . Come on , Turgis , you ought to know a bit better . Standing there talking a lot of nonsense ! " " I was telling him it was nonsense , " said Turgis , rather sullenly . " He 's got this shadowing on the brain . He goes following some chap for miles , and then because this chap does n't take any notice of him  --  he does n't know he 's there , of course , and does n't care , anyhow  --  he thinks he 's a little Sexton Blake . " " No , I do n't , " said Stanley , wrinkling up his freckled face until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing you can do , Stanley , " said Mr. Smeeth , sitting down at his desk , " is to drop these silly tricks . They 'll get you into trouble one of these days . Why do n't you do something sensible in your spare time ? Get a hobby . Do a bit of fretwork or collect foreign stamps or butterflies or something like that . " 76 ANGEL PAVEMENT " Huh ! Nobody does them things now . Out of date , " Stanley muttered . " Well , work 's not out of date , not here , anyhow , " Mr. Smeeth retorted , in time-old schoolmaster fashion . " So just get on with a bit . " Miss Matfield arrived , quarter of an hour late , as usual . " Do n't talk to me , anybody , " she commanded . " I 'm furious . Of all the foul lunches I 've ever had in this city , to-day 's was the foulest . It makes me sick to think about it . Look here , is Mr. Dersingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got umpteen things for him to sign . Can you do anything with them , Mr. Smeeth ? " " I 'll have a look at them , Miss Matfield , " said Mr. Smeeth wearily . The afternoon dragged on. ivAt five o'clock , Mr. Dersingham arrived , bursting in like a large pink bomb . He was breathless , perspiring , and all smiles . " Afternoon , ev'rybody , " he gasped . " Is there a late spot of tea goin ' ? Does n't matter if there is n't . I say , Miss Matfield , just drop ev'rything , will you , and bring your notebook to my room . I want to dictate some letters and a circular . Stanley , you get ready to copy the circular . And , Turgis , you ring up Brown and Gorstein and say I want to speak to Mr. Gorstein . And Smeeth , I shall want you when I 'm through with these letters , about a quarter of an hour 's time , and will you bring that statement of the outstanding accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorstein 's and Nickman 's paymentsthis last year ? Good man ! " Mr. Dersingham liked to signalise his arrival in this fashion  --  it Iooked as if he was starting the day for everybody , and it still looked like that even if he did it at five o'clock  --  but now there was a difference . His voice had a triumphant ring , in spite of the fact that he was short of breath . There was about his whole manner a Napoleonic abruptness and self-confidence . He presented the spectacle  --  rareANGEL PAVEMENT 77enough too  --  of an Old Worrelian in big business . At one bound the temperature of the office rose about ten degrees , and Mr. Smeeth , as he investigated the firm 's somewhat melancholy relations with Brown &; Gorstein and Nickman &; Sons , was visited once more by quite wildly optimistic fancies . Undoubtedly , something had happened . When at last he was called into Mr. Dersingham 's room , he soon learned what it was that had happened . It was , as he had suspected more than once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smeeth , " Mr. Dersingham continued . " I ie 's got the sole agency for all this new Baltic stuff . They wo n't sell it to anybody here but Golspie . It 's good wood , all of it , quite up to standard , and he can get it at prices , thirty , forty and fifty per cent . lower than we 've been paying . I do n't mind telling you that when he first explained what he was after , I was n't keen at all , not a bit keen . It sounded fishy to me . " " Does seem a bit queer he should come along like that , does n't it , sir ? " " It does , Smeeth , and that 's what I thought . But we 've been going round with some of his samples at prices we could sell the stuff at on his figures , and they 've been absolutely leaping at them . We can cut everybody out , absolutely clean out . We can do more business , Smeeth , with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , even in its best days , in a month . And you know what business we 've been doing lately ? Awful ! A ghastly show ! By the way , Smeeth , Goath was partly to blame for that . Oh yes , he was . Thirty years in the trade and all that  --  but the fact is , they were all tired of seeing his depressing old mug , and he 'd given up trying . Golspie soon showed me that , though I must say I 'd had my suspicions for some time . " " So had I , sir . " " Exactly ! Goath had to be booted out , and as it was he booted himself out . He 'll be feeling very sorry for himself soon . Now then , this is what 's happening . Golspie came along here to see me quiteby chance . He 'd got this contract , but he wanted some firm already in the trade to join up with . All this is  --  er  --  in  --  y'know  --  between ourselves , Smeeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smeeth , flattered and delighted . " Golspie  --  Mr. Golspie  --  does n't want a partnership , ca n't be both- ered with it . He 's coming in here as a sort of general manager , working on a jolly good commission . You 'll have to know all about that , of course , because of the books . It 's a hefty commission all right , but then he 's bringing all the business really , and he 'll be responsible for getting the wood over and all that side of it . And the two of us will be working together , running things here . I 'll go out a good deal myself for the next few months , and we 'll have to get some fellow  --  somebody young and keen  --  to take Goath 's place . " " You wo n't be cutting down the office staff then ? " said Mr. Smeeth , greatly relieved . " Cutting it down ! We 'll have to jolly well increase it , and quickly too . That far sample room will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall want that . You 'd better get another typist to help Miss Matfield  --  a young girl will do  --  as soon as possible . This next week or two , Smeeth , " and here Mr. Dersingham sprang up and clenched his fists , just as if he had never seen a decent public school , " we 've got to drive it hard , go all out , and I 'm depending on you for the office side of it . You people have got to stand behind me in this . It 's a great chance for all of us , and , of course , a tre- mendous stroke of luck , Golspie 's coming here . He 's going all out himself on this  --  he 's that sort of chap , very keen and all that  --  and we 've got to keep pace . " " You can count on me doing my best , Mr. Dersingham , " Mr. Smeeth assured him fervently . " There 's one or two things I 'd like to know about , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his about payments ? " " he 's going to talk to you about that , Smeeth . We 've only just touched on that , so far . " " And another thing , sir , " Mr. Smeeth continued , more hesitantlynow . " You know how we stand at the bank just now . If we 're branching out , we 've got to have something behind us there . " " I 've been looking into that this afternoon , " said Mr. Dersingham . " We ca n't do anything more with the bank at present , but I think I can borrow a bit to see us through . We 've got to have something to jolly well play with , this next month or so , particularly as Mr. Golspie talks about wanting some of his commission in advance , so to speak . " Mr. Smeeth looked grave , then coughed . " Do you think that would I , e wise , Mr. Dersingham ? I mean  --  er  --  after all , you 've no guarantee " You mean  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , is n't that it ? " cried the other , grinning . " Well of course I thought of that . I thought of God knows how many swindles yesterday morning , because , as I said , the whole thing seemed fishy to me , and , between ourselves , I thought Golspie himself a terrible outsider at first . But I 've gone into all that . He does n't draw his commission until the stuff has been delivered to our people , of course , but he wants his money then , without waiting until the account 's finally settled . Though , by the way , Smeeth , we 're not going to give these fellows so much rope in future . With this new stuff on our hands , we can afford to tighten it up a bit , do n't you think ? " " That 's so , Mr. Dersingham . I 'd like to see one or two of these accounts closed altogether . They 're more bother than they 're worth . " Mr. Smeeth hesitated . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is he going to be in charge of the office ? " " In a way , yes , " the other replied , with the air of a man who had given this question a great deal of thought . " You can take it , he is . Though of course it 's still my show " Of course , Mr. Dersingham . " " Suppose , by any chance , you disagree violently with anything he suggests , you 'll come to me , " said Mr. Dersingham , looking at that moment like a large pink conspirator . " But you need n't tell that to the other people out there . " 8oANGEL P A V E M E N T " I see what you mean , sir , " said Mr. Smeeth , who felt that he would see in time . " Mr. Golspie has a good deal to learn , of course , " Mr. Dersingham continued , airily . " He does n't know the trade , and he does n't know the City . But  --  he seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time , and he 's got ideas , y'know , and colossal push . Rum sort of chap , I must say . " Then he became business-like again . " Now look here , Smeeth , I want to push off as soon as I can because I want that money  --  or some of it  --  into the bank by to-morrow afternoon . Ask Miss Matfield to hurry up with those letters so that I can sign ' em . And just see those circulars get away to-night , will you ? " " I will , Mr. Dersingham . " And Mr. Smeeth turned away , but stopped before he reached the door . " And if you do n't mind me sayingso , sir , I 'm very pleased things are looking up like this . I was beginning to feel worried , very worried , sir . " " Thanks , Smeeth ! Good man ! " You could not mistake the Old Worrelian now . " Things will be humming here soon , you 'll see . Colossal luck , of course , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's probably coming in soon . " Mr. Golspie did come in , but only after Mr. Dersingham had gone and for about half an hour or so , during which he merely asked Mr. Smeeth a few questions . He came again the next morning , and Mr. Smeeth had to join him and Mr. Dersingham in a little conference . Mr. Golspie then returned about half past four , dictated some letters , nosed about the office , examined the far room , and did some telephoningat Mr. Dersingham 's table , Mr. Dersingham himself being out visiting Nickman and Sons . The others had gone , and Mr. Smeeth was putting away his books for the night , when Mr. Golspie came out of the private office and began asking more questions , chiefly about accounts . The two of them stayed there another twentyfiveminutes , at the end of which Mr. Golspie suggested they should round off the proceedings by having a drink . When they were at the bottom of the stairs , Mr. Smeeth remembered that he was nearly out of tobacco ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Own Mixture every week ) and said he would slip in for some . Mr. Golspie followed him in , and T. Benenden was so surprised to see this massive and large-moustached stranger again , in company with Mr. Smeeth this time , too , that he weighed out the tobacco and put it in the pouch without saying a word . " You got any good cigars , good cigars ? " Mr. Golspie demanded in his resonant bass , at the same time staring hard , even harder than the tobacconist had stared at him . " Certainly , I have , " replied T. Benenden with dignity . And he produced two or three boxes . Mr. Golspie chose two cigars , cut them , then popped one into his own mouth , stuck the other into Mr. Smeeth 's , and lit the pair of them , without a word . Then , after blowing a stream of smoke at Benenden , he said : " How much ? " " Three shillings , for the two . " Mr. Golspie slapped down two half-crowns on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about this big Cement slump , gentlemen ? " he began . " Where 's that going to land us ? " " It 's not going to land me anywhere , " said Mr. Golspie . " Where 's it going to land you ? " T. Benenden looked rather pained , and still nursed the two shillingschange in his hand . " Well , what I mean is this . That 's a big combine , is n't it ? A year ago , they were bang at the top , like nearly all the big combines . All right . But what 's happening now ? A slump . And why ? " " I do n't know , and I 'll bet you do n't know , " said Mr. Golspie heartily . Then he gave a short bellow of a laugh . " Well , I 'll be damned , " he roared , " I 've been puzzling my head for the last five minutes wondering what was wrong with you . " " Me ? " T. Benenden was startled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at you ? " He turned to Mr. Smeeth . " Could n't make it out . I knew there was something82 ANGEL PAVEMENTwrong . You see it , do n't you ? " He now returned to Benenden , at whom he pointed a thick brutal finger . " Why , man , you 've forgotten to put your tie on . Have a look at yourself . I knew there was something . Is that my change ? That 's correct  --  two shillings . " Mr. Smeeth followed him out of the shop , gasping . He had been visiting Benenden 's shop two or three times a week , year after year , and never once had he dared mention the word " tie . " And now this chap comes along with his " You 've forgotten to put your tie on . " Mr. Smeeth began to chuckle softly . Mr. Golspie piloted him across the road and into the private bar of the White Horse . " Give it a name , " said Mr. Golspie . " Thanks , Mr. Golspie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Smeeth modestly , from behind his large cigar . " Do n't have a glass of bitter . Too cold a night like this and after a hard day 's work , too . Have a whisky . That 's right . Two double whiskies and some soda . " It was quiet and cosy in the White Horse . Mr. Smeeth had not been in for a long time , and he was enjoying this . The fire winked cheerfully over the grate ; the rows of liqueur bottles glimmered and glittered ; the glasses shone softly ; there was a pleasant hum of talk ; the cigars plunged them at once into an atmosphere of rich , fragrant , luxurious conviviality ; the whisky tasted good , and washed away that foggy , smoky , railway tunnel flavour of Angel Pavement ; and Mr. Golspie , still mysterious and masterful but genial now too , was obviously anxious they should be on friendly terms . " You 've got a fellow working in the Midlands and the North , have n't you ? " Mr. Golspie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whiskies . " What 's he like ? " " Dobson ? He 's a decent young chap , and he 's got a good connectionup there . He 's not sold much lately , but it 's not been for the want of trying . " " We ought to be hearing from him soon , then , " said Mr. Golspie . " If he ca n't sell these new veneers , he 'd better be walking . TheyANGEL PAVEMENT 83sell themselves . We 've orders pouring in , just pouring . But , mind you , Smeeth , we 've got to get a move on . We 've got to pile up the orders now  --  make hay while the sun shines . We want another man for London and district , soon as we can get one . And one that 's alive , too , not like that dreary old devil I booted out the first day . You might as well send the dustbin round looking for orders . There ought to be three of us , me , Dersingham , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these next few months . Rush ' em . That 's the way , is n't it ? " Mr. Smeeth , taking out his cigar and trying to look keen and aggressive , said it was . " I 'll tell you what I believe in , " Mr. Golspie continued , not troubling to lower his voice , or rather to moderate it , for it was low enough . " I believe in working like hell and in playing like hell . If you 're going to work , for God 's sake  --  work . And if you 're going to enjoy yourself , well , for the love of Mike , enjoy yourself , get on with it . " At this point , Mr. Smeeth started back , for suddenly a head , a large head wearing a very dirty cap , but only about the height of his shoulder , stuck itself between him and Mr. Golspie . " That 's all very well , gents , " it said , with an impudent whine , " but what if yer ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , eh ? Wotcher goin ' ter do then , eh ? " " There 's one thing you can do , " said Mr. Golspie promptly . " Wha 's that ? " " You can mind your own bloody business , " said Mr. Golspie , pushing his face out in a most intimidating and disagreeable fashion . The intruder shrank back at once . " Here y'are , " Mr. Golspie said in a milder , contemptuous tone , " here 's threepence . Go away and buy yourself something . " " Thank yer , mister . " And the head vanished . " This city 's got more and more rats like that in it every time I come back to it . " " There is n't the work , you know , " said Mr. Smeeth earnestly . " I84 ANGEL PAVEMENTdo n't say they all want it , but there is n't the work . I 'll tell you candidly , Mr. Golspie , it frightens me sometimes to see all the chaps looking for work . If we 've to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , you 'll see what I mean . Crowds and crowds  --  ready to work for next to nothing . It 's a heart-breaking job interviewingthem . " " I dare say , " Mr. Golspie replied , in the tone of a man whose heart is not easily broken . " But I know this . A man who 's ready to work for next to nothing is no good to me . I would n't have him as a gift . And that reminds me , Smeeth . What 's this firm paying you ? " Mr. Smeeth hesitated a moment , then told him . " And do you think that 's enough ? " Mr. Smeeth hesitated again . " Well , if business was good , I was going to ask for a rise this Christmas , but as you know , it 's not been good . " " No , but it 's going to be good , do n't make any mistake about that , " cried Mr. Golspie . " It 's going to be a dam ' sight better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil was Twigg ? Never mind about him , though . I 'm going to tell you straight out , I do n't think you 're getting enough . I know a good man when I see one , and when people stand by me  --  you know what I do ?  --  that 's right  --  I stand by them . And I 'm going to stand by you . " " Very good of you , Mr. Golspie , " muttered the embarrassed Smeeth . " The minute these orders that are coming now are turned into solid business  --  and , mind you , it means more work and responsibility for you all along the line  --  the minute they do , you 're going to get a rise , a good rise , a hundred or two a year right off , or I 'm not Jimmy Golspie . And we shake hands on that . " Mr. Smeeth , overwhelmed , found himself shaking hands on it . " And now , " Mr. Golspie added masterfully , " we 'll just sign and seal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 " All right . But  --  er  --  it 's my turn . " " Not a bit of it . Not to-night . You have n't a turn to-night . Wait till the big rise comes . Two singles , please . Married man , are n't you , Smeeth ? " " I am . Wife and two children , boy just out of his teens and girl nearly eighteen . " " All I 've got 's a girl . I 'm expecting her over soon . Does this girl of yours take much notice of you ? " " Not much . Seems to me they do n't , nowadays . " " You 're right there . That girl of mine does n't  --  the wilful , artful little devil . She 's been spoilt all her life , and always will be . Too good-lookin ' , that 's her trouble . Does n't take after her father , y'know , " and here Mr. Golspie disturbed the whole bar with a suddendeep guffaw . " Well , here 's the best ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you come to think of it . I 've had a finger in all sorts of trades , all over the place , and this is a bit more respectable than some of ' em . But when you think of it  --  it 's a dam ' rum trade  --  selling thin bits of wood to glue on to other bits of wood , eh ? " " I 've often thought that , " said Mr. Smeeth eagerly , the philosopher waking in him too . " I 've often thought  --  well , I du n no  --  but this trade 's like a good deal of the rest of life . Veneers ? Well , Mr. Golspie , just think of them . They 're only there to make a piece of furniture look as if it was made of better wood than it is made of , a sort of fake . But everybody knows about it . There 's no deception . And I 've often thought a lot of life 's like that , particularly when I 've gone into company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnut through and through " And the lot of ' em veneered to hell , " cried Mr. Golspie jovially . " Never mind , let 's see if we ca n't slap all our stuff on to their rotten chairs and wardrobes and sideboards , and make money and enjoy ourselves . That 's the game . " With that , they swung out into the little night of Angel Pavement , where the diapason of Mr. Golspie could be heard thundering86 ANGEL PAVEMENTout again that it was the game . With rich Havana still in his nostrils , the golden liquor of the glens wandering round his inside like an enchanted Gulf Stream , and Mr. Golspie 's promises singing their madrigals in his head , Mr. Smeeth felt for once that it really might be all a game . Waiting for his tram that night , he bought two evening papers instead of one , and read neither of them . Chapter ThreeTHE DERSINGHAMS AT HOME rI:t Y THE middle of the following week , there were several changesat Twigg &; Dersingham 's . The greatest change was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely opened the outerdoor , remaining on that side of the frosted glass partition , youwould have felt the difference at once . No doubt the typewritersrattled and pinged , the telephone bell rang , voices came through , allin a new and bustling , optimistic fashion . The very chair you wereinvited to sit on , when you waited behind that partition , had beendusted . Mrs. Cross had not found herself immune from this newinfluence : she had given the general office a thorough cleaning . There was no question now of anybody not having enough workto do . Stanley still went out , indeed he went out more than ever , buthe was compelled to speed up his " shaddering " methods and wasonly able to follow men who were in a tremendous hurry . Mr.Smeeth among his little figures was as busy and happy as a monkat his manuscript . Turgis , whose duty it was to see that goods wereduly forwarded to and from Twigg &; Dersingham 's , became bothhoarse and haughty down the telephone to all manner of forwardingagents , and spoke to railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Matfield rattled off her letters withslightly less contempt and disgust , rather as if they were no longerthe effusions of complete lunatics but were now merely the work of village idiots . And she had acquired an assistant . The staff ofTwigg &; Dersingham had been enlarged at the beginning of this8788 ANGEL PAVEMENT week by the appointment of a second typist . Miss Poppy Sellers had arrived . The girls who earn their keep by going to offices and working typewriters may be divided into three classes . There are those who , like Miss Matfield , are the daughters of professional gentlemen and so condescend to the office and the typewriter , who work beneath them just as girls once married beneath them . There are those who take it all simply and calmly , because they are in the office tradition , as Mr. Smeeth 's daughter would have been . Then there are those who rise to the office and the typewriter , who may not make any more money than their sisters and cousins who work in factories and cheap shops  --  they may easily make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut superior and ladylike figures in their respective family circles because they have succeeded in becoming typists . Poppy belonged to this third class . Her father worked on the Underground , and he and his family of four occupied half a house not far from Eel Brook Common , Fulham , that south-western wilderness of vanishing mortar and bricks that are coming down in the world . This was not Poppy 's first job , for she was twenty and had been steadily improving herself in the commercial world since she was fifteen , but it was easily her most important one . She had been chosen out of a large number of applicants , had been started at two pounds and ten shillings a week , and had been told confi- dentially by Mr. Smeeth , who seemed to her a terrifying figure , that she had good prospects if she would only learn and work hard .. This Poppy fully intended to do , for  --  as her testimonials were corn- pelled to admit  --  she was a very industrious and conscientious girl . She was not sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung about the entrance to the Red Hall Cinema in Walham Green ( and Poppy frequently visited the Red Hall with her friend , Dora Black , for she liked entertainment ) , but nobody yet had said that she was pretty . She was small and slight , had dark hair and brown eyes , and she aimed , rather timidly , at a Japanese or Javanese or general Oriental effect , wearing a fringe and all that , but only succeeded in looking vaguely dingy and untidy . Whenever she despairingly made a special effort , plying hard the lipstick , being lavish with the Oriental-effect face-powder , and raising and keeping her eyebrows so high that it hurt , people asked her if she was n't feeling very well . This failure to achieve the exotic beauty that wasasboth she and Dora Black believed  --  " her type , " tended to keep poor Poppy slightly depressed and out of love with herself . During her first few days at Twigg &; Dersingham 's she was like a mouse . She was overawed by the newness and importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for her to make a friend of the large , superior , infinitely knowledgeable , tremendously condescendingMiss Matfield . But , like a mouse , she kept her eyes open , missing nothing , with her busy little Cockney mind fastening on every crumb of information and gossip . After three days , Miss Dora Black of Basuto Road , Fulham , knew more , though at second-hand , about the office staff of Twigg &; Dersingham than Mr. Dersingham himself had learned in three years . One of Miss Poppy Sellers ' first tasks had been to copy out replies to the letters answering Twigg &; Dersingham 's advertisement in the Times and the Daily Telegraph . This was for another man , to take Goath 's place , though he would have to spend much of his time further afield . He had to be as unlike Goath as possible in character , but not unlike him in experience . In short , he had to be " young , keen , energetic , " and " with some connection in furnishing trade and knowledge of veneers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golspie was such that Twigg &; Dersingham were able to declare that for the right man there was " a good opening . " It has been said that the modern English do not like work . It cannotbe said that they do not look for it and ask for it . The day after this advertisement appeared , the postal heavens opened and a hurricaneof letters fell upon Twigg &; Dersingham . Into Angel Pavementall that day there poured a bewildering stream of replies . It seemed as if street after street , whole suburbs , had been waiting for this particular opening . There were , it appeared , dozens of men90 ANGEL P A V E M E N Twith vast connections in the furnishing trade and the most thorough , the most intimate knowledge of veneers and inlays , and most of these men , though they had apparently refused scores of offers recently , were only too willing to assist Messrs . Twigg &; Dersingham . Then there were men who had not perhaps exactly a connection , but had been for years , so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who had sold pianos , who had given removing estimates , who had done a little valuing , who knew something about upholstering . Then there were older men , ex-officers many of them , who knew about all kinds of things and were ready to enclose the most astonishing testimonials , who admitted that the furnishing trade and veneers and inlays were all new to them but who felt that they could soon learn all there was to know , and in the meantimewere anxious to show how they could command men and to display their unusual ability to organize . And , last of all , there were the public school men , fellows who knew nothing about veneers and inlays and did not even pretend to care about them , but pointed out that they could drive cars , manage an estate , organise anything or anybody , and were willing to go out East , being evidently under the impression that Twigg &; Dersingham had probably a couple of tea plantations as well as a business in veneers and inlays . These correspondents expressed themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notepaper , from superiorparchment to dirty little pink bits that had been saved up in a box on the mantelpiece , but in one particular they were all alike : they were all keen , all energetic . " This tells you something about the old country , does n't it ? " said Mr. Golspie , who always talked as if he came from some newer one . He and Mr. Dersingham and Mr. Smeeth had been going through the pile . " It 's only the slump , " said Mr. Dersingham , who was feeling optimisticthese days . " It 's not so bad as it was , is it , Smeeth ? " " I suppose it is n't , really , Mr. Dersingham . " But Mr. SmeethANGEL PAVEMENT 9 , ended rather doubtful . These letters had given him another glimpseif the dark gulf . It was a sight that left him feeling shaky . Mr. Golspie grunted . " Far as I can see from this lot , you can havethe pick of England 's talent for four or five quid a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do  --  except find work . Well , I 've got about four likely ones here . What have you chaps got ? " After a good deal more trouble and talk , they finally narrowed the possible applications down to ten , and these ten were asked to appear at the office in the early afternoon , two days later . They all came at once , and so had to wait their turn on the landing outside , while Stanley , enjoying himself hugely , dashed in and out to summonthem . Mr. Smeeth , going round to the bank , had to make his way through this little crowd , and at the first moment , when he stepped outside the office and the two or three of them nearest the door made way for him with almost ostentatious smartness , he felt triumphant , proud , a solid and successful man among a lot of failures . But the very next moment , this feeling disappeared . They were all very well brushed , in their best clothes , and were already looking keen and energetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenest and most energetic , their faces having already taken on the expression most likely to impress the mysterious powers within the office . A few of them were young and had an easy confident look , that of men merely seeking a change of job . Others were older , less confident , tense or wistful . Mr. Smeeth bumped into one , the last in the group , who was standing at the corner near the top of the stairs . " I beg your pardon , " the man cried , eagerly , anxiously . He was indeedan anxious man , about Mr. Smeeth 's age and not unlike him , greyish , lined , brittle ; a man with a wife and family and vanishing possessions ; a man who time after time had found himself the last in the group , waiting at the corner , with the hope inspired by the letter , the letter that came thunderingly , triumphantly , that morning , like an act of deliverance , now dying in him . " My fault , " Mr. Smeeth assured him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P A V E M E N Tsmile of a polite culprit . But when their eyes met fairly , this smile trembled , then fled , leaving Mr. Smeeth himself grave , anxious . He suddenly felt for this man a swelling sympathy , a deep stir of pity , that he had not known for many a month . They might have been brothers ; and , indeed , brothers they were for a second or so , peering at one another in some darkened house of tragedy . " Good luck ! " Mr. Smeeth heard himself saying . " Thanks , " and there came the ghost of a smile . Mr. Smeeth never saw him again . He had no luck . The successful applicant was very different , much younger , a tall fellow with a remarkably small head , an inquisitive pink nose , and a very wide mouth that opened to show about twice the ordinary number of teeth . His name was Sandycroft , and he knew the trade , for though he had never sold veneers and inlays , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers . This set him apart from all the other applicants . Moreover , he appeared to be all keenness and energy , and threw the most passionate emphasis into the slightest remark he made . " Mr. Twigg , " he cried , addressing Mr. Goispie , " and Mr. Dersingham , you can rely on me . I know the trade . I know the people . I know the ropes , if you do n't mind me saying so . " " All right , " said Mr. Goispie with his usual genial brutality . " But do n't go knowing too many ropes . Eh , Dersingham ? " " Oh , quite ! " replied Mr. Dersingham , who did not quite follow this , but looked knowing all the same . " I understand , sir . I know what you mean . I could n't do it , sir . It 's not in my character . Honesty is n't everything , but I believe it 's the first thing . And I 'm straight . I believe in being straight , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he , too , believed in Sandycroftand his like being straight . " And if it 's possible , gentlemen , " Sandycroft continued , looking from one to the other of them , " I 'd like to stay on now and just pick up the threads , so that I can start right away on the road tomorrow morning . I 'm keen to get going , desperately keen . YouANGEL P A V E M E N T 93know what it is , sir . After only a week or two doing nothing much , a man like me feels rusty . I want to get on with it . My wife laughs at me . Have a rest , ' she says . But no , I 'm not like that . I must be getting on with something . " " Good man , " said Mr. Dersingham approvingly . " Well , I think we 'll have to be getting on with something , too , " said Mr. Goispie . " He 'd better come round here in the morning and learn what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send him out . " " I think he had , " replied Mr. Dersingham . " Look here , you 'd better go home now  --  break the news to your wife and that sort of thing , eh ?  --  and then be down about nine or so in the morning , If we 're not here then , you have a talk to Smeeth  --  that 's the cashier , out there  --  and he 'll be able to tell you something . " " Very good , sir , " and you would have thought the speaker was about to salute smartly before retiring . He did not , however , but threw a keen and energetic glance at Mr. Golspie ( whom he had recognised at once as the dominant partner ) , then a keen and energeticglance at Mr. Dersingham , picked up his hat ( and in such a manner as to suggest that he could do some wonderful things even with that , if he wished to ) , brought his hat in front of the second button of his overcoat , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit like a torpedo from its tube . Actually , what Mr. Dersingham and Mr. Golspie did get on with was an invitation to dinner , delivered by Mr. Dersingham and accepted by Mr. Golspie . It had come to that . There were things about Goispie that did not please Mr. Dersingham , for he was dogmatic , rough , domineering , and was apt to jeer and sneer in a way that left Mr. Dersingham 's mind bruised and resentful . A few terms at Worrell would obviously have made a great difference to ( ; olspie , who now , in his middle age , showed only too plainly both by word and deed that he was not a gentleman . From that there was no escape : Golspie was not a gentleman . But Dersingham did not think of him as an Englishman who is not a gentleman , a bit of a bounder , an outsider ( and there can be no doubt that Golspie94 ANGEL PAVEMENTat times did talk and act like a bounder , a complete outsider ) ; he contrived to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary command of the English language . This was not difficult , because Golspie did seem to have spent most of his time outside England and to have no roots in this country . And the fact remained that he had presented the firm of Twigg &; Dersingham with a new and glorious lease of life , as if he were a god , a commercialgod with a baldish head and a large moustache . So the Dersinghams had talked it over and decided that he must be asked to dinner , properly asked to dinner and not merely invited to take pot-luck some Sunday . And this meant something , for though your Old Worrelian who has to hack out his living in the City will smoke a cigar and drink a whisky or share a couple of club chops , if necessary , with any fairly decent sort of fellow he meets in the way of business , he draws the line  --  his own words  --  at inviting most of these fellows into his home , to meet his wife and possibly another Old Worrelian or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of certain pronounced defects , he received such an invitation , which , by the way , he accepted calmly enough , with no show of surprise or gratitude . " There 'll be some other people I think you 'd like to know , " said Mr. Dersingham , " but we wo n't make'li too formal . Just a black tie , y'know , black tie . " He said this as people always say it , that is , as if a white tie weighed a ton and they are letting you down lightly . " What do you mean ? Wear a dinner jacket ? " " That 's the idea , " said Mr. Dersingham , telling himself that really Golspie was extraordinarily out of touch . " And  --  er  --  eightish then , next Tuesday , eh ? " " Right you are , " replied Mr. Golspie . " Very pleased . " IIThe Dersinghams occupied a lower maisonette in that region , eminently respectable but a trifle dreary , between Gloucester RoadANGEL PAVEMENT 95and Earl 's Court Road : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who live in that part of London have the privilege , as the estate agents point out in all their advertisements , of " overlooking gardens , " which means that their windows stare down at iron railings , sooty privet and laurel hedges , and lawns and flower-beds that look as if they are only too willing to give up the unequal struggle . Some of these gardens are better than others , but Barkfield Gardens is not one of them . It is one of the smallest and dreariest of the squares , and is rapidly losing caste , its houses slipping through the maisonette and large flat era too quickly and already coming within sight of the small flats , the nursing homes , the boarding houses , the girls ' clubs . The Dersinghams did not like Barkfield Gardens . They did not like their maisonette , all the rooms of which seemed higher than they were long or broad and were singularly cheerless . Mr. Dersingham never did anything about it , because he was waiting  --  as he always said  --  until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might gather that he knew where he stood philosophically or socially or politically or artistically . ) Now and again , however , Mrs. Dersingham would read all the advertisement columns devoted to desirable residences , rush round to some agents , and even inspect a few houses , but as she had never really decided what it was she wanted , and her husband never succeeded in knowing where he stood financially , they remained at 39A , in the rooms that made them seem like insects at the bottom of a test-tube , grumbling , while a stream of cooks and housemaids , endlessly diverted from four local registries , flowed through the dark basement , leaving as sediment innumerablememories of glum looks , impertinent answers , lying references , missing silk stockings , broken crockery and ruined meals . For some women this state of affairs , making comfort and tranquillity impossible , would have had its compensations , for it would have providedunlimited material for talk , but Mrs. Dersingham prided herself on not being the sort of woman who spends her time discussing the shortcomings of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and they told one another what they could96 ANGEL P A V E M E N Thave said had they been that sort of women , and then gave examples . " I know , but listen to this , my dear , " they all cried at once . At seven-forty-five on the evening of the dinner party to which Mr. Golspie had been invited , Mr. Dersingham was busy being his own butler , attending to the wines . He poured some claret into one decanter , some Sauterne into another , and some port into a third , then poured a little gin and a great deal of French and Italian vermouthinto a cocktail shaker , and carried the shaker and some glasses into the drawing-room . Having done this , he remembered the cigarettes and filled the silver cigarette box , a wedding present bearing the Worrell colours in enamel , with Sahibs and some Turkish that his wife always said she preferred to any other , no matter what they happened to be . Then he presented himself with a cocktail , looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs , which were long , low , fat , and brown , glanced round the room , which seemed to him a very handsome and friendly place now that the two shaded lights took away the attention from the great bleak expanse of wall above , sipped the cocktail , tried to hum a tune , and began to feel a certain warm glow , a feeling proper to a host . Mrs. Dersingham , who was in the bedroom , trying to powder the space between her shoulder blades , was less fortunate . She felt anxious . Cook had been rather cross all day and might spoil everything , and even when she tried , she was apt to make the soup greasy and forget the salt in the vegetables . And Agnes , the new maid , had pretended to understand all about serving , but she was so stupid that she might easily go sticking vegetable dishes under people 's noses anyhow , and there was hound to be some awful confusion when it came to clearing the table for dessert . You could laugh it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughing it off . It was a pity this sort of thing could n't be done properly or laughed off altogether . How terribly tiresome it was ! And then , too , all the time you were so worried and anxious about the food and the serving , you were expected to be keeping the conversation going , terribly bright and hostessy . ANGEL PAVEMENT 97 " I wish , " said a silly girl at the back of Mrs. Dersingham 's mind , a girl who had always been there but who did not say much except when she was rather tired or cross  --  " I wish I was a terribly successfulactress who lived in a marvellous little flat and had a terribly devoted maid and a dresser and a huge car and nothing much to cat before the performance and then went on and was absolutely marvellous and everybody applauded and then I put on a wonderful Russian sable coat and diamonds and went out to supper and everybodystared . No , I do n't . I wish I was a terribly successful woman writer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimosa and things and lunch in the sunshine and marvellous distinguishedpeople coming to call . No , I do n't . I wish I was terribly rich with a housekeeper and about fifteen servants and a marvellous maid of my own and umpteen Paris model gowns every season and a house in Town and a place in the country and a very attractive dark young man , very aristocratic and a racing motorist or yachtsmanor something like that , terribly in love with me but just devoted and respectful all the time and coming and looking so miserable and me saying I 'm sorry , my dear , but you can see how it is . I can never love anybody but Howard , but we can still be friends , ca n't we ? ' " This silly girl still went rambling idiotically on while there returnedinto the rest of Mrs. Dersingham 's mind various queries and worries about the sauce for the fish and the creme caramel not setting properly and Agnes spilling things . And all the time she was powderingher back or neck , trying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tiny reddened pad , and staring at her reflection in the Jacobean mirror that she had bought at Brighton and that turned out to be a poor mirror and not Jacobean at all . The one consolation was that you always knew that you actuallylooked better than you did in that stupid mirror . Remembering this for the thousandth time , Mrs. Dersingham switched off the light , stood outside the night nursery a moment to discover if the children were quiet , then joined her husband in the drawing-room. 98 ANGEL PAVEMENT " Oh , thank goodness , nobody 's here yet , " she said , pulling a cushionor two about , then warming her hands . " It 's such a ghastly rush . It 's wonderful to have a few minutes ' peace and quietness . " She was already talking as if company were present . " Rather , " said Mr. Dersingham , loyally . She stood in front of him now . " I suppose I look a thorough mess , " she continued with a relapse into her natural manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dersingham mumbled , feeling awkwardas usual . He always had a suspicion that he ought to have said something first : " My word , you 're looking jolly fine to-night , " something of that sort . But somehow he never did . " Do n't be What I 'd really like is early bed and a book . This rush and seeing people all the time is so terrible . " Once more , she was beginning to put on her company manner . Mrs. Dersingham did not look a thorough mess , but neither did she look as attractive as she hoped she did . She looked like hundreds of other English wives in their earlier thirties , that is , fair , tired , bright , and sagging . She had pleasant blue eyes , a turned-up nose , and a slightly discontented mouth . Her life , apart from the secret saga of the kitchen and the nursery , where creatures with the most astoundingly good references were for ever turning out to be lazy , impudent , and thieving , was really rather dull , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . But this she would not admit , not even to her husband , except on rare occasions when she lost her temper , broke down , and the truth came blazing through . She pretended that her life was one exciting and multicolouredwhirl of people and social events . She did not actually tell lies , but she created an atmosphere in which every little occurrence was instantly distorted and magnified , like objects dropped into a glass tank full of water . A tea on Monday and a dinner-party on Friday were transformed into a week 's feasting , a rushing here , there , and everywhere , not enjoyed but endured . If she met a persontwo or three times , then she had met whole crowds of him orA N G E L P A V E M E N T 99her , day and night . Two matinees ( with an old school friend or her mother up from Worcester ) coming within one week reduced her to the condition of a dramatic critic at the end of a heavy autumn season . Even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , met a person , seen a play , read a book , she contrived to give these confessions a positive instead of a negative flavour , and so strong a positive flavour that somehow she seemed to be in close contact with the function , person , play , or book . She did this partly by throwing the emphasis on the anxiliary verb : " No , I have n't seen her , " or : " No , I have n't seen it , " which suggested to the listener that Mrs. Dersingham had attended a series of important committee meetings , had thrashed it out , and had decided with the rest that there should be nothing done about these people , these plays , these books , just yet . Thus , by this and other methods , she created an atmosphere in which a few outings and encounters were transformed into a rich and strenuous social life , which , so strong are our dreams , frequently left her genuinely fatigued . All this puzzled that simple man , her husband , but he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the company had gone , why she had complained so much about having to rush about , when he , for his part , could not see she had done much rushing about , she had turned on him quite fiercely and said that if it depended on him she would be sitting moping in the flat , never seeing anybody or anything , from one week 's end to another , and that the less he said the better ; an answer that left him completely bewildered . The Dersinghams , standing together now on their bearskin rug , heard the first guest arrive . It must be either Golspie or the Trapes . It could not be the Pearsons , who , living in the maisonette above , always waited until they heard some one else arrive below , before they made their appearance . And Golspie it was , looking strangely unfamiliar to Mr. Dersingham in a rather voluminous dinner jacket and a very narrow black tie . He had hardly been introduced to Mrs. Dersingham before the Pearsons , who were just as anxious not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came in , breathless and smiling. roo ANGEL PAVEMENT " A-ha , good evening ! " cried Mr. Pearson , as if he had found them out . " And how are you , my dear ? " cried Mrs. Pearson to her hostess , in such a tone of voice that nobody would have imagined that they had met less than four hours ago . The Pearsons were a middle-aged , childless couple , who had recentlyretired from Singapore . Mr. Pearson was a tallish man , with a long thin neck on which was perched a pear-shaped head . His cheeks were absurdly plump , a sharp contrast to all the rest of him , so that he always appeared to have just blown them out . He was both nervous and amiable , and consequently he laughed a great deal at nothing in particular , and the sound he made when he laughed can only be set down as Tee-tee-tee-tee-tee . Mrs. Pearson , who was altogether plump , had her face framed in a number of mysteriousdark curls , and looked vaguely like one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had perhaps retired , after queening it in The Catch of the Season , to keep a jolly boarding-house . They were a lonely , friendly pair , who obviously did not know what on earth to do to pass the time , so that this was for them an occasion of some importance , to be looked forward to , to be referred to , to be enjoyed to the last syllable of small talk . They were now all shouting at one another , after the fashion of hosts and guests in Barkfield Gardens and elsewhere . " Found your way here all right then ? " Mr. Dersingham bellowedto Mr. Golspie . " Came in a taxi , " Mr. Golspie boomed over his cocktail . " That 's the best way if you 're going to a strange house in London , is n't it ? " Mr. Pearson shouted . " We always do it when we can afford it . Tee-tee-tee-tee-tee . " " And how 's the little darling to-night ? " Mrs. Pearson inquired at the top of her voice , affectionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant 's temperature , and it was normal . He 's all right , " Mrs. Dersingham screamed in reply , elaborately unmaternalas usual . ANGEL PAVEMENT rot " I 'm so glad , so glad . " And as she said it , Mrs. Pearson looked all beaming and moist . " I was so afraid there might be something really wrong with the dear kiddy . I was telling Walter that you thought it might be a chill . I 'm so glad it was n't , my dear . You ca n't be too careful with them , can you ? " " This Russian business looks pretty queer , does n't it ? " Mr. Dersingham shouted . " Very queer . What do you make of it ? " Mr. Pearson shouted in reply . He made nothing of it himself yet , because the evening paper had not told him what to make of it and he had heard nobody 's opinionyet . On any question that had its origin west of Suez , Mr. Pearson liked to agree with his company . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own , and when Singapore itself was actually involved , he had been known to contradict people . " Well , I 'll tell you , Dersingham , " said Mr. Golspie who as usual knew his own mind . " It 's all a lot of tripe , bosh , bunkum . I know those yarns . Fellows up in Riga trying to earn their money , they send out that stuff . " " That 's terribly interesting , Mr. Golspie , " Mrs. Dersingham shrieked at him , suddenly looking like a woman of the world who had wanted to get to the bottom of this business for some time . " Of course , you 've been up there , have n't you ? " " Round about . " And Mr. Golspie gave her a grin , at once sardonicand friendly . It seemed to tell her that she was all right , not a bad-looking girl , but she must n't try to draw him , for that was n't her line at all , not at all . " It makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" Just got a furnished flat in Maida Vale , " replied Mr. Golspie . " Now I do n't think I know that part , " Mrs. Pearson said , girlishly reflective . " There 's a lot of London we still do n't know . Tee-tee-tee-tee-tee . " Ioa ANGEL PAVEMENT " You 're not missing much if you do n't know Maida Vale , from what I 've seen of it , " Mr. Golspie boomed away . " Where I live seems to be full of Jews and music-hall turns .

" cried Mrs. Pearson , who had not lived at Singaporefor nothing : she knew her cues . " Tee-tee . " Triumphant this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for already Agnes had had enough of the evening and she had not liked the way this particular guest had walked in and looked at her . There is something to be said for Agnes . Miss Verever was one of those people who , at a first meeting , demand to be disliked . She was Mrs. Dersingham 's mother 's cousin , a tall , cadaverous virgin of forty-five or so , who displayed , especially in evening clothes , an uncomfortable amount of sharp gleaming bone , just as if the upper part of her was a relief map done in ivory . In order that she might not be overlooked in company and also to protect herself , she had developed and brought very near to perfection a curiously disturbing manner , which conveyed a boundless suggestion of the malicious , the mocking , the sarcastic , the sardonic , the ironical . What she actually said was harmless enough , but her tone of voice , her expression , her smile , her glance , all these suggested that her words had some devilish inner meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean , merely by asking what time the post went or inquiring if it had rained during the night , she had made men wonder if they had not shaved properly and women ask themselves if something had gone wrong with their complexions , and compelled members of both sexes to consider if they had just said something very silly . After that , she had only to perform the smallest decent action for people to say that she had a surprisingly kind heart as well as a terrifyingly clever satirical head . This was all very well if people had booked rooms under the same roof for the next three months , but on chance acquaintances , wonderingANGEL PAVEMENT 103indignantly what on earth she had against them , this peculiar manner of hers had an unfortunate effect . She now advanced , kissed her hostess , shook hands with her host , and then , pursing her lips and screwing up the rest of her features , said : " I hope you 've not been waiting for me . I 'm sure you have , have n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this simple question immediately made the whole dinner party appear preposterous . " No , we have n't really , " Mr. Dersingham told her , at the same time asking himself why in the name of thunder they had ever thought of inviting her . " Somebody still to come . The Trapes . " " Oh , I 'm glad I 'm not the last , then , " said Miss Verever , with a bitter little smile , which she kept on her face while she was being introduced to the other guests . A minute later , the Trapes arrived to complete the party . Late guests may be divided into two classes , the repentant , who arrive , perspiring and profusely apologetic , to babble about fogs and ancient taxis and stupid drivers , and the unrepentant , who stalk in haughtily and look somewhat aggrieved when they see all the other guests , their eyebrows registering their disapproval of people who do not know what time their own parties begin . The Trapes were admirablespecimens of the unrepentant class . They were both tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was an Old Worrelian and a contemporary of Dersingham 's . He was a partner in a firm of estate agents , but called himself Major Trape because he had held that rank at the end of the war and had become so soldierly training the vast mob of boys who were conscripted then that he could not bring himself to say good-bye to his outworn courtesy title . He was indeed so curt , so military , so imperial , that it was impossible to imagine him letting and selling houses in the ordinary way , and the mind 's eye saw him mopping up , with a small raiding party , all flats and bijou residences , and sallying out with an expeditionary force to plant the Union Jack on finely timbered , residential and sporting estates . His wife was a somewhat colourless woman , 104 ANGEL P A V E M E N T ANGEL PAVEMENT Io5very English in type , who always looked as if she was always faintly surprised and disgusted by life . Perhaps she was , and perhaps that was why she always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly any movement of her small iced features . Leaving them all to shout at one another , Mrs. Dersingham now slipped out of the room , for it was imperative that dinner should be announced as soon as possible . She returned three minutes later , trying not unsuccessfully to look as if she had not a care in the world , a sort of Arabian Nights hostess , and then , after the smallest interval , Agnes popped her head into the room , thereby forgetting one of her most urgent instructions , and said , without any enthusiasmat all : " Please , m ' , dinner 's served . " Mrs. Dersingham smiled heroically at her guests , who , with the exception of Mr. Golspie , looked at one another and at the door as if they were hearing about this dinner business for the first time and were mildly interested and amused . Mr. Golspie , for his part , looked like a man who wanted his dinner , and actually took a step or two towards the door . Then began that general stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place at this moment in all those unhappy sections of society that have lost formality and yet have not reached informality . There they were , smiling and dithering round the door . " Now then , Mrs. Pearson , " cried Mr. Golspie in his loudest and most brutal tones . " In you go . " And , without more ado , this impatientguest put a hand behind Mrs. Pearson 's elbow , and Mrs. Pearsonfound herself through the door , the leader of the exodus . They crowded into the small dining-room , where the soup was already steaming under the four shaded electric lights . " Now let me see , " Mrs. Dersingham began , as usual , feeling that these guests were not people now but six enormous bodies of which she , the wretched criminal , had to dispose . " Now let me see . Will you sit there , Mrs. Trape . And Mrs. Pearson , there . " And then , having disposed of the bodies , she had time to notice that the soup looked horribly greasy . IIIThe soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contrived to be looking down at it very curiously every time Mrs. Dersingham glanced across the table at her . As there were eight of them , Mrs. Dersingham was not sitting at the end of the table , opposite her husband . Mr. Golspie was there , and very much at his ease , putting away a very ungentlemanly quantity of bread under that great moustache of his . On Mr. Golspie 's right were Mrs. Dersingham , Major Trape , and Mrs. Pearson , and on the other side were Miss Verever , Mr. Pearson , and Mrs. Trape . " And how , " said Miss Verever to Mrs. Dersingham , " did you enjoy your Norfolk holiday this summer ? You never told me that , and I 've been dying to know . " The smile that accompanied this statement announced that Miss Verever could not imagine a more idiotic or boring topic , that you would be insufferably dull if you answered her question and terribly rude if you did n't . " Not bad , " Mrs. Dersingham shouted desperately . " In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . " " Really , you found it cold ? " And you would have sworn that the speaker meant to suggest that the cold had obviously been manufactured for you and that it served you right . At the other end of the table , Major Trape and his host were talking about football , across Mrs. Pearson , who nodded and smiled and shook her mysterious curls all the time , to show that she was not really being left out . " Do you ever watch rugger , Golspie ? " Mr. Dersingham demandeddown the table . " What , Rugby ? Have n't seen a match for years , " replied Mr. Golspie . " Prefer the other kind when I do watch one . " Major Trape raised his eyebrows . " What , you a soccah man ? Not this professional stuff ? Do n't tell me you like that . " " What 's the matter with it ? " ro6 ANGEL P A V E M E N T " Oh , come now ! I mean , you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , selling fellahs for money and so on , very unsporting . " " I must say I agree , Trape , " said Mr. Dersingham . " Dashed unsporting business , I call it . " " Oh , certainly , " Major Trape continued , " must be amatahs  --  love of the game . Play the game for its own sake , I say , and not as all these fellahs do  --  for monay . Ca n't possibly be a sportsman and play for monay . Oh , dirty business , eh , Dersingham ? " " I 'm with you there . " A sound came from Mrs. Trape 's face and it seemed to declare that she was with him too . " Well , I 'm not with you , " said Mr. Golspie bluntly . He did not care tuppence about it , one way or the other , but there was something in Trape 's manner that demanded contradiction , and Mr. Golspie was not the man to ignore such a challenge . " If a poor man can play a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him ? What 's the answer to that ? A man 's as much right to play cricket and football for a living as he has to clean windows or sell tripe " Tripe indeed ! How can you , Mr. Golspie ? " cried Mrs. Pearson , girlishly shaking her curls at him . " My wife hates tripe , " said Mr. Pearson . " Tee-tee-tee-tee-tee . " " I disagree , " said Major Trape , stiffer than ever now . " Those things are business , quite diff'rent . Games ought to be played for their own sake . That 's the proper English way . Love of the game . Clean sport . Do n't mind if the other fellahs win . Sport and business , two diff'rent things . " " Not if sport is your business , " Mr. Golspie returned , looking darkly mischievous . " We ca n't all be rich amachures . Let the chaps have their six or seven pounds a week . They earn it . If one lot of chaps can earn their living by telling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go to listen to ' em : I do n't  --  why should n't another lot be paid to knock a ball about every Saturday , without all this talkANGEL PAVEMENT 107of dirty business ? It beats me . Unless it 's snobbery . Lot o ' snobbery still about in this country . It pops up all the time . " " What is this argument all about ? " Miss Verever inquired . And , perhaps feeling that Mr. Golspie needed a rebuke , she put on her most peculiar look and brought out her most disturbing tone of voice , finally throwing in a smile that was a tried veteran , an Old Guard . But Mr. Golspie returned her gaze quite calmly , and even conveyeda piece of fish , and far too large a piece , to his mouth before replying . " We 're arguing about football and cricket . I do n't suppose you 're interested . I 'm not much , myself . I like billiards . That 's one thing about coming back to this country , you can always get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I used to be very fond of a game of billiards , snooker too , " said Mr. Pearson , nodding his head so that his fat cheeks shook like beef jellies , " when I was out in Singapore . There were some splendid players at the club there , splendid players , make breaks of forty and fifty . But I was n't one of them . Tee-tee-tee " We went to see Susie Dean and Jerry Jerningham the other night , " said Major Trape , turning to Mrs. Dersingham . " Good show . Very clevah , very clevah . You been to any shows lately , Mrs. Dersingham ? " " That 's true , " Mrs. Pearson informed her host and anybody else who cared to listen . " When we were out in Singapore , my husband was always going over to the club for billiards . And now he hardly ever plays . I do n't think he 's had a game this year . Have you , Walter ? I 'm just saying I do n't think you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what with one thing and another , " Mrs. Dersingham told Major Trape , " I 've simply not been able to see half the plays I 've wanted to see . Something has to go , has n't it ?

Well , what with that , and then going to Mrs. Westbury 's musical tea-fight  --  Dossevitch and Rougeot ought to have been there and were only prevented from coming at the last minute , but Imogen Farley was there and played divinely .

And so I have n't had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Jove , you have n't , have you ? " said Major Trape , with whom this miracle of the social loaves and fishes worked every time . " You 're worse than Dorothy , and I tell her she overdoes it . Must n't overdo it , you know . " Mrs. Dersingham , wondering how long Agnes was going to be bringing up the cutlets , shrugged her shoulders , and did it exactly as she had seen Irene Prince do it in Smart Women at the Ambassadors . " It is stupid , I know , " she confessed charmingly , " and I 'm always saying I 'll cut most of it out  --  but  --  well , you know what happens . " Miss Verever , wearing her most peculiar smile , leaned forward , caught the eye of her hostess , and said , " But what does happen , my dear ? " Mrs. Dersingham was able to escape , however , by plunging at once into the talk at the other end of the table , as if she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been reading that ? " she cried across the table to Mrs. Trape , who did not look as if she had spoken for weeks , but nevertheless had actually just conjuredout several remarks . " No , I have n't read it , and I do n't mean to . " But did Agnes mean to bring the cutlets ? The talk at Mr. Dersingham 's end , as we have guessed , had suddenlyturned literary . Mrs. Trape had just read a certain book . It was , she added , apparently throwing her voice into the claret decanter , a very clever book . Mr. Dersingham had not read this book , and did not hesitate to say that it did not sound his kind of book , for after a jolly good hard day in the office he found such books too heavy going and preferred a detective story . Mrs. Pearson wasA N G E L P A V E M E N T 109actually reading a book , had been reading it that very afternoon , had nearly finished it and was enjoying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story you 'd like , Mr. Dersingham , " she cried , " even though there are n't any detectives in it . I could hardly put it down . It 's all about a girl going to one of those Pacific Islands , one of those lovely coral and lagoon places , you know , and she goes there to stay with an uncle because she 's lost all her money and when she gets there she finds that he 's drinking terribly , and so she goes to another man  --  but I must n't spoil it for you . Do read it , Mrs. Trape . " The claret decanter murmured that it would love to read it , and asked what the name of the book was , so that it might put it down on its library list . " I 'll tell you the title in a moment , " and Mrs. Pearson , bringing her curls to rest , bit her lip reflectively . " Now how stupid of me ! Do you know , I ca n't remember . It 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me take it when the girl at the library showed it to me . Now is n't that silly of me ? " " I can never remember the titles either , " Mr. Dersingham assured her heartily . " What was the name of the chap who wrote it ? Was it a man or a woman ? " " I think it was a man 's name , in fact I 'm nearly sure it was . It was quite a common name , too . Something like Wilson . No , it was n't , it was Wilkinson . Walter , do you remember the name of the author of that book I 'm reading ? Was n't it Wilkinson ? " " You 're thinking of the man that came to mend the wireless set , " Mr. Pearson replied , shooting his long neck at her . " That was Wilkinson . You know the people , Dersingham  --  the electricians in Earl 's Court Road ? " " Oh , so it was . How silly of me ! " " Tee-tee-tee-tee-tee . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you see I ca n't tell you now , but I 'll tell Mrs. Dersingham in the morning and then she can tell you . " rro ANGEL PAVEMENTA sudden silence fell on the table at that moment , perhaps because there was a sort of scratching sound at the door , which opened , but only about an inch or two . That silence was shattered by the most appalling crash of breaking crockery , followed by a short sharp wail . Then silence again for one sinking moment . The cutlets and the vegetables had arrived at last , and a brown stain , creeping beneath the door , told where they were . " My God ! " cried Mr. Golspie to Miss Verever , as Mrs. Dersinghamdashed to the door , " there goes our dinner . " " Indeed ! " " You bet your life ! " Mr. Golspie , earnest and unabashed , assured her . Miss Verever and Major Trape exchanged glances , which removed Mr. Golspie once and for all from decent society and handed him over to the social worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the doorway , and Mr. Dersingham was trying to follow her example but could not do so because , what with cutlets , vegetables , gravy , broken dishes and plates , a weeping Agnes , and a panic-stricken Mrs. Dersingham , there was no space for him . So he stood there , holding the door open , with his body inside the dining-room and his head outside . " Oh , do shut the door , Howard , " the guests heard Mrs. Dersinghamcry . " All right , " the invisible head replied hesitatingly . " But I say  --  ca n't I  --  er  --  do anything ? I mean , do you want me to come out or  --  er  --  well , what do you want me to do ? " " Oh , go-in-and-shut-the-door . " And there was no doubt that in another moment Mrs. Dersingham would have screamed , for this was the voice of a woman in an extremity . Mr. Dersingham closed the door and returned to his chair . He looked at Major Trape , and Major Trape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering the good old school , Worrelians together . ANGEL P A V E M E N T III " Sorry , but  --  er  --  " and here Mr. Dersingham looked round apologeticallyat his guests  --  " I 'm afraid there 's been some sort of accident outside . " Immediately , Mrs. Trape , Mrs. Pearson , Major Trape , and Mr. Pearson began talking all at once , not talking about this accident but about accidents in general , with special reference to very queer accidentsthat had happened to them . Miss Verever merely looked peculiarly at everybody , while Mr. Golspie finished his claret with a certain remote gloom , as if he were a man taking quinine on the summit of a mountain . Then the door , which had not been properly fastened , swung open again , to admit a mixed knocking and gobbling and guggling noise that suggested that Agnes was now lying on the floor , in hysterics , and drumming her feet . Then came a new voice , very hoarse and resentful , and this voice declared that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy with her hands , and that one pair of hands was one pair of hands and could not be expected to be any more , and that while notices were being given right and left , her notice could be taken , there and then . In short , the cook had arrived on the scene . Mr. Dersingham arose miserably , but whether to shut the door again or to make an entrance into the drama outside we shall never know , for Mrs. Pearson , fired with neighbourly solicitude , sprang up , crying , " Poor Mrs. Dersingham ! I 'm sure I ought to do something , " and was outside , with the door closed behind her , before Mr. Dersingham knew what was happening . And Mrs. Pearson , once outside , did not simply intrude , did not gape and hang about and get in the way , but took charge of the situation , for though Mrs. Pearson may have been a foolish tabletalker , may have worn mysterious curls and been old-fashioned and monstrously girlish and affectionate , she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical domestic storms in Singapore . II2 ANGEL P A V E M E N T " I knew you would n't mind my coming out , " she cried , " and I felt I must help , because after all we are neighbours , are n't we ? and that makes a difference . " " It 's too absurd , " Mrs. Dersingham wailed . " This wretched girl 's smashed everything and ruined the dinner , and now she 's going off into a fit or something out of sheer temper . And it 's all her own fault . I engaged her sister to come and help her to-night , and then when her sister could n't come , at the last minute of course , she would n't let me get anybody else , she said she could do it herself . " Mrs. Pearson was looking at Agnes , who was still guggling and drumming on the floor . " Only stupid hysterics . Get up at once , you silly , silly girl . Do you hear ? You 're in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon bring her round , you 'll see . " The cook , who was standing in the hall , a few yards away , and had been looking on with the air of a complacent prophetess , now began to lose some of her rigidity . The mournful triumph died out of her face . She had no respect for Mrs. Dersingham , but for some strange reason she had almost a veneration for Mrs. Pearson , who was possibly a far more ladylike and commanding figure in her eyes . " That 's so , " the cook hoarsely declared now . " A jug of water 's what she wants . Accidents will happen and one pair of hands ca n't be two or three pairs of hands , eight for dinner being out of all reason with them steps and no service lift , but there 's no call to be lying there all night , Agnes , having your hysterics and carrying on silly when there 's all this mess to be cleared , let alone anything else . " This treacherous withdrawal of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon brought the hysterics to mere choking and sniffing , and in a minute or two Agnes was bending over the ruins . " I 'll clear these away , " she announced between sniffs and chokes , " but I wo n't bring anything else and serve it , I wo n't . I could n't if I tried , I could n't . I have n't a nerve in me body , not after what 's happened , I have n't . " ANGEL PAVEMENT 113 " But I shall have to give them something , " Mrs. Dersingham was saying . Clearly she no longer included Mrs. Pearson among the guests . Mrs. Pearson had ceased to be one of " them . " " Of course you will , my dear , " cried Mrs. Pearson , her eyes gleamingwith a happy excitement . " Not that we 'd mind , of course . It 's the men , is n't it ? You know what the men are ? Now then , what about eggs ? " " Eggs , " the cook repeated hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' two eggs only , in that kitchen . Just the two eggs , and them 's for the morning . " " Listen , my dear . " And Mrs. Pearson clutched at her neighbour affectionately and imploringly . " Do leave it to me and I promise you I wo n't be ten minutes . I wo n't , really . Now not a word ! Do n't bother about anything . Just you leave it to me . " She hurried towards the outer door , pulled herself up before she reached it , and cried over her shoulder , " But warm some plates , that 's all . " During the subsequent interval , Mrs. Dersingham had not the heart to return to the dining-room , though she did just look in , put her face round the door and smile apologetically at everybody and say that it was too absurd and annoying and that the two of them , she and Mrs. Pearson , would be back in a few minutes . She spent the rest of the time superintending the salvage work outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warm . She felt hot , dishevelled and miserable . She could have cried . Indeed , that was why she did not slip upstairs to her bedroom to look at herself and powder her nose , for once there , really alone with herself , she was sure she would have cried . Oh , it was all too hateful for words ! " There ! " And Mrs. Pearson stood before her , breathless , flushed , and happy , and whipped off the lid of a silver dish . " Oh ! " cried Mrs. Dersingham in the very reek of the omelette , a fine large specimen . " You angel ! It 's absolutely perfect . " " I remembered we had some eggs , and then I remembered we114 ANGEL P A V E M E N Thad a bottle of mushrooms tucked away somewhere , and so I rushed upstairs and made this mushroom omelette . It ought to be nice . I used to be good with omelettes . " " It 's marvellous . And I do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Dersingham meant it . From that moment , Mrs. Pearson ceased to be a merely foolish if kindly neighbour and became a friend , worthy of the most secret confidences . In the steam of the omelette , rich as the smoke of burnt offerings , this friendship began , and Mrs. Dersingham never tasted a mushroom afterwards without being reminded of it . " Do n't think of it , my dear , " said Mrs. Pearson happily , for her own life , after months of the dull routine of time-killing , had suddenly become crimson , rich and glorious . " Now have you got the plates ready ? You must have this served at once , must n't you ? Where 's that silly girl ? Gone to bed ? All right , then , make the cook serve the rest of the dinner . She must have everything ready by this time . Call her , my dear . Tell her to bring up the plates . " And they returned at last to the dining-room , two sisters out of burning Troy . Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened during the interval of waiting . It was not the women , who were all sympatheticsmiles and solicitude : Mrs. Trape even dropped the ventriloquialeffect , actually disturbed the lower part of her face , in order to explain that she knew , no one better , what it was these days , when anything might be expected of that class ; and Miss Verever , though retaining automatically some peculiarities of tone and grimace , contrived to say something reassuring . No , it was not the women ; it was the men . Mr. Golspie looked like a man who had already said some brutal things and was fully prepared to say some more ; Major Trape looked very stiff and uncompromising , as if he had just sentenced a couple of surveyors to be shot ; Mr. Pearson gave the impression that he had been faintly tee-teeing on both sides of a quarrel and was rather tired of it ; and Mr. Dersinghamlooked uneasy , anxious , exasperated . There was no mistakingANGEL PAVEMENT 115the atmosphere , in which distant thunder still rolled . The stupid men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner ; they had felt empty , then they had felt cross ; and so they had argued , shouted , quarrelled , not all of them perhaps , but certainly Mr. Golspieand Major Trape . Probably at any moment , they would begin arguing , shouting , quarrelling again . Mrs. Dersingham , very tired now and with a hundred little nerves screaming to be taken out of all this and put to bed , would have liked to bang their silly heads together . Cook came in , breathing heavily and disapprovingly , and gave them their omelette . There was not a single movement she made during the whole time she was in the room that did not announce , quite plainly , that she was the cook , that the kitchen was her place , that she did not pretend to be able to wait at table and that if they did not like it they could lump it . Her heavy breathing went further , pointing out that when she did condescend to wait at table , she expected to find a better company than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour , for she had her plate shoved contemptuously in front of her , like the rest . Real ladies , that plate said , do n't rush away and cook omelettes for other people'sdinner tables . " P'raps you 'll ring when you want the next , " the cook wheezed , and then slowly , scornfully , took her departure . " If you do n't mind my saying so , Mrs. Dersingham , " said Major Trape , " this omelette 's awf'ly.good , awf'ly good . And there 's nothing I like better than a jolly good omelette . " A voice from Mrs. Trape 's direction said that it agreed with him . " They 're right there , " said Mr. Golspie to Mrs. Dersingham , as if the Trapes were not often right . " It 's as good an omelette as I 've had for months and months , and that 's saying something , because I 've been in places where they can make omelettes . They ca n't make ' em here in England . " And he said this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a challenge to Trape , who was nothing if not patriotic . Obviously , he and Trape had been quarrelling. 116 ANGEL PAVEMENT ANGEL PAVEMENT Ir7Major Trape stiffened , then smiled laboriously at his hostess . " Mr. Golspie seems to think we ca n't make anything in England . That 's where he and I diffah . Is n't it , Dersingham ? " " Well , yes , in a way , I suppose , " Mr. Dersingham mumbled unhappily . He felt divided between Worrell and Angel Pavement , between his old and respected school friend , Trape , with whom he instinctively agreed , and the forceful man who was now saving Twigg &; Dersingham and making it prosperous , his guest for the first time , too ; and it was a wretched situation . He muttered now that there was a lot to be said on both sides . " There may be , " said Major Trape . " But I do n't like to hear a man continually runnin ' down his own country . Tastes diffah , I suppose . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . " " Time it was done then , " said Mr. Golspie aggressively . " Most of the people I meet here these days seem to be living in a fool 's paradise " Now , Mr. Golspie , " cried his hostess with desperate vivacity , " you 're not to call us all fools . Is he , Mrs. Trape ? We wo n't have it . " Then , saving the situation at all cost , she turned to Miss Verever . " My dear , I forgot to tell you , I 've had the absurdest letter from Alice . When I read it , I simply howled . " " No , did you ? " said Miss Verever . " A-ha ! " cried Mr. Dersingham , doing his best . " What 's the latest from Alice ? We must all hear about this . " They were all listening now , all at peace for the moment . " Oh , it was too ridiculous , " cried Mrs. Dersingham , despairingly racking her brains to remember something amusing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any letter she had ever had from anybody . " You know what Alice is  --  at least , you do , my dear , and so do you . I suppose it is n't really funny unless you know her . You see , the minute I read a letter of hers , of course I can see her in my mind and hear her voice and all that sort of thing , and unless you can do that , well I dare say it is n't so funny , after all . But , yousee , Alice  --  she 's my youngest sister , I must explain , and they live down in Devon  --  oh , miles from anywhere . Will you ring , please , darling ? Well , Alice has a dog , the absu-u-urdest creature She struggled through with it somehow , and fortunately cook made such a noise clearing and then serving the sweet that most of the anecdote , presumably the funniest part , was lost in the clatter . The cook had been so noisy , so incredibly heavy in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving the sweet , that Mrs. Dersingham dare not have her up again to clear the table for dessert , so as the fruit-plates and the finger-bowls , the port decanter and glasses , were all on the sideboard , she made a joke of it  --  showing the last gleam of vivacity she felt she would be able to show for months  --  and she and Dersingham , assisted by Mr. Pearson , who said  --  tee-tee-tee-tee-tee  --  that he was used to clearing a table , having been well brought up , did what they could to make the dinner look as if it were coming to a civilised end . Mrs. Dersingham felt that Mr. Golspie , plainly a porty sort of man , and Major Trape might not want to argue so unpleasantly once they had some port inside them . This was the longest and most ghastly dinner she ever remembered . It was not really very late , but it seemed like two in the morning . As she tried to peel a very soft pear , she felt she wanted to throw it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice . It was then they heard a ring at the outer door . Perhaps the postman , rather late and with something special to deliver . A minute or so later , there came another and longer ring . " The only time we were there it rained for a whole week , " said Major Trape , concluding his account of the watering places , " and so I said , Nevah again . ' Ca n't imagine how these towns get their reputation . These weathah reports they give outAnother ring , very determined this time . " I 'm sorry , but do go and see who that is at the door , my dear , " Mrs. Dersingham cried , apologetically . " I 've just remembered . Agnes118 ANGEL P A V E M E N T ANGEL P A V E M E N T I19has gone to bed , and cook probably ca n't hear or wo n't hear . I do n't suppose it 's anybody but the late post . " Mr. Dersingham was absent several minutes , and somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Dersingham did not press the fruit upon her guests . The moment the last piece was eaten , she intended to rise from the table , and then  --  oh , thank Heaven !  --  the worst was over . The men could stay on drinking port and quarrel like cats and dogs if they liked . She would be out of it , among nice , silly , comfortable women in the drawing-room , and so it would all be over . And then , just as she was nearly succeedingin consoling herself , her husband reappeared , and he was not alone . The idiot had brought a complete stranger into the diningroomwith him , a girl . She was a very pretty girl , quite young , and on his face was that fatuous smile which husbands always seem to wear in the company of young and very pretty girls . All wives recognize and detest that fatuous smile . It is bad at any time , but when it accompanies a girl who is a complete stranger into the dining-room at the conclusion of a disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife who has not felt even decently presentable for hours and hours and who has been ready to scream for the last forty-five minutes , then it is a catastrophe and a mortal injury . And so Mrs. Dersingham gave Mr. Dersingham one look that sent that fatuous smile trembling into oblivion . And then , half rising from her chair , Mrs. Dersingham looked at the stranger , and decided at once that she had never before seen a girl she disliked so much at sight as this one . " I 'm afraid  --  er  --  I do n't " she began . But the girl was not even looking at her . She was busy having her left cheek brushed by the large moustache of Mr. Golspie , who had flung an arm round her shoulders . " Well , hang me , Lena girl , " Mr. Golspie was roaring , " if I had n't forgotten all about you . " " You would , " said the girl coolly . " You 're a rotten father . I 've told you that before . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , " Mr. Golspie boomed at the Dersinghams , turning from one to the other , " my fault entirely . I ought to have told you . I meant to , but I forgot . This girl of mine wrote to say she was coming from Paris to-day , but of course she did n't say how and when and what and where , just left it all vague , y'know , as usual , all up in the air . When it got to be half past seven and she had n't turned up , I began to wonder . What was I to do ? " And as he asked this he stared fiercely at Mr. Pearson , who happened to catch his eye . " Quite so , Mr. Golspie , " Mr. Pearson , startled , jerked out . " Well , I 'll tell you what I did do . I left a message with the caretakerof the flats , so that if she did come she 'd know where I was  --  " All right , my dear , " his daughter interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody wants to hear all about it . I got the message . I was n't going to spend hours all alone in that poisonous flat . So I took a taxi and came here . And that 's that . " And having thus dismissedthe subject , Miss Golspie , who seemed an astonishingly cool and composed young lady , smiled at Mrs. Dersingham , who did not return the smile . Miss Golspie then produced a small mirror from her handbag and carefully examined her features in it . And even Mrs. Dersingham would have been compelled to admit that they were very charming features . Lena Golspie still remained , after closer inspection , a very pretty girl . She had reddish-gold hair , large brown eyes , an impudent little nose , and a luscious mouth . She looked rather smaller than she actually was . Her neck , shoulders , and arms were slenderly , even too delicately , fashioned , but she had strong , well-shaped legs ; and was indeed the complete attractive young female animal . Only in a certain slant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , though a very acute listener might have found some likeness in theirr2o ANGEL P A V E M E N Tvoices . Their accent , however , was quite different , for Mr. Golspie spoke with a breadth of vowel sound and roughness of consonants that suggested the toned-down Lowlander or North-country Englishman , whereas his daughter 's English did not properly belong to any part of England but seemed to be that international English , of a kind that a clever foreigner might pick up in the Anglo-Saxon colonyin Paris and that is sometimes spoken by both English and Americans on the stage , a language without roots and background , a language for " the talkies . " Indeed , in Lena 's company you might have felt you were taking part in a " talkie . " " And I intended to tell you when I first came in , " Mr. Golspie continued , determined to have his say . " Just to warn you that this daughter o ' mine  --  who does n't behave herself as nicely as she looks , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Quite all right , of course , " said Mr. Dersingham . " I mean  --  delighted ! " " Good ! No harm done , then . " And Mr. Golspie sat down , grinned at his daughter , noticed the decanter in front of him , and promptly helped himself to another glass of port . " But I must say , " cried Lena , who had now concluded the examination of her own features and was busy examining everybody else 's , " I thought you 'd have finished dinner hours ago . Did you begin late or have you been wolfing an awful lot ? " " I think we 'd better all go straight into the drawing-room , " said Mrs. Dersingham hurriedly , " unless you men feel you must stay and drink some more port . " " Not a bit , " said Mr. Golspie heartily . " I 'm ready , for one . " And to show that he was , he drained his glass in one sharp gulp . " Only too delighted , Mrs. Dersingham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if indirectly to rebuke the uncouth Golspie . " Good work ! " said Mr. Dersingham , who obviously felt that something was still wrong somewhere and was trying in vain toANGEL PAVEMENT 121appear hearty and enthusiastic . He opened the door . " Much better if we all barge in together now . " " Come along , Miss Golspie , " and the patient little smile that Mrs. Dersingham contrived to produce was itself a studied insult . " We do n't mind a bit your not being dressed . It does n't matter at all , I assure you . " Miss Golspie turned wondering large brown eyes upon her . " Oh , did you want me to change ? I would have done if I 'd known  --  specially as I 've brought over one or two marvellous new dresses  --  but it did n't seem worth it . Sorry and all that ! " " Not in the least , " replied Mrs. Dersingham , pale with weariness and vexation . Cheerfully  --  oh , so cheerfully !  --  she could have murderedthis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did not seem particularly pleased to see them . It had been neglected itself for some time  --  so that the fire was low and ashy  --  and now it did not seem to welcome visitors . Cook arrived with coffee , and put down the tray with the air of a camel exhibiting the last straw . She did not attempt to serve it . She put it down on the rickety little table and immediately made that table seem ten times more rickety . There was no cup for Miss Golspie , who of course said at once that she would have some coffee , and so Mr. Dersingham , with what seemed to his wife a great deal of unnecessary fuss and silliness , insisted that he should go without . And then , having taken the tiniest sip of coffee , this Golspie girl ostentatiously put the cup on one side , and , on being asked by Mr. Pearson , who had also turned silly and officious , if she would have some more , replied that she did not really want any coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she declared , in a loud clear voice , " I 'd adore a cocktail , if there are any going . " " Oh , would you , Miss Golspie ? " Mr. Dersingham began . " Well , I dare say I could rake up " But he was not allowed to continue . " I 'm afraid there are n't any cocktails going , " said Mrs. Dersing-122 ANGEL P A V E M E N Tham , in a voice that was if anything louder and clearer , and as frosted as the best Martini . And the insensitive Mr. Golspie did not improve the situation by chiming in with " I should think not . Do n't you take any notice of her , Mrs. Dersingham . I 'll give her cocktails ! " " When you get her home , eh ? " Mr. Pearson cried , with rash facetiousness . " Tee-tee-tee-tee-tee . " It was easily his least successful " Tee-tee " of the evening . Mrs. Pearson looked surprised at him . Mr. Golspie gave him a glance that told him quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be funny . Lena herself shot a furious glance at both her father and Mr. Pearson , but did not cast a single look in Mrs. Dersingham 's direction  --  a very ominous sign . As for Mrs. Dersingham , she could not decide which was the more awful , Mr. Golspie or his terrible daughter . She tried to start a conversation with Mrs. Pearson , who was now all embarrassed smiles , and Mrs. Trape , whose face had been completely frost-bound for the last ten minutes . Miss Verever , every feature in battle order , now bore down on Lena , opening the engagement with a long-range smile of the most sinister peculiarity . " Do I understand , Miss Golspie , " she said , with the most mysterious grimace and the most baffling inflections , " that you 've just come from Paris ? Have you been living there ? " " Hello , hello ! " cried Lena 's startled expression . " What have I done to you ? " But all she actually said in reply was , " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living there . " " Oh , you have been living there ? " " Yes , for the last eighteen months . With an uncle . You see , he lives there , and I 've been living with him . " " Oh , your uncle lives there ? " " Yes , he 's lived there nearly all his life . He is half French , anyhow . And my aunt 's completely French . " " Then is your father  --  Mr. Golspie  --  half French ? " asked Miss Verever , in one of her strangest whispers . ANGEL PAVEMENT 123 " No , not at all , " said Lena , with a little impatient shake of her head . " You see , this uncle 's my mother 's brother , not my father 's . " " Oh , your mother 's . " And now Miss Verever produced her most famous glance of inquiry , awfully enigmatical in its final meaning and yet immediately challenging . She followed it up with a new smile , crooked , terrible . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , I suppose , just like your uncle ? " " Yes , she was . " And then Lena 's little nose wrinkled , partly in bewilderment , partly in distaste . Then she looked straight at Miss Verever , who was bending over her and searching her with an unwinking gaze . " But what about it ? I mean , there 's nothing particularlyfunny about that , is there ? Lots of people are half French , are n't they ? " " Yes , I suppose so . " Miss Verever was taken aback . " Well , then , what are you looking at me like that for ? " cried Lena , at once registering a direct hit . " I mean , you look as if there was something terribly weird about it all . There really is n't , you know . It 's all quite simple . " The shell crashed through and explodedsomewhere near the magazine . Miss Verever was jerked upright by her surprise . Then she turned glacial . " I beg your pardon . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wait to hear , but turned away at once and joined the other three women . Lena , after staring after her for a moment , gave a tiny wriggle and then broke into a duet of Old Worrelian talk between Mr. Dersingham and Major Trape , who were merely chivalrous at first but very soon began to wear that fatuous smile . And towards the three of them an icy current began to flow from the group of women . Too tired , too cross , even to pretend to be a good brisk hostess , Mrs. Dersingham let the whole thing slide , and merely prayed for the end . It was not long in coming . " Shall I ? " Miss Golspie was heard to cry to the two men. 124 ANGEL PAVEMENTThey nodded and smiled , a little doubtfully perhaps , but still they nodded and smiled , men under a spell . " All right , then , I will . Just to cheer us all up . We 're getting terriblydismal . " And Miss Golspie , with a final and coquettish nod and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smilers , marched across the room , puffing away at one of her host 's Sahibs . Then she sat down at the baby grand . " That 's the way , Lena , " her father shouted approvingly . He had been talking in a corner to Mr. Pearson . " Let 's have a tune . Do us good . " Before anybody else could say a word , Lena had begun playing . She played some dance tunes , very sketchily , but with great speed and noise . The first two or three minutes were bad , but the next two or three minutes were much worse , for then her left hand , guessing wildly , began hitting any note roughly in the neighbourhood of the right one , and the very fire irons joined in the din . After ten minutes , she reached a grand fortissimo . Mrs. Dersingham could bear it no longer . " Oh , do stop that noise ! " she shrieked , rushing forward , white and trembling with fury . Lena stopped at once . They were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dersingham bit her lip , recovered herself . " I 'm sorry , " she said , coldly and curtly , " but I really must ask you to stop playing . I 've  --  got a bad headache . " " I see , " replied Lena , getting up from the piano . " Sorry . " She walked forward a step or two , then looked at Mrs. Dersingham . " Have you had it all the evening or has it just come on now ? " And this was not a polite inquiry , but a challenge . The tone of voice made that obvious . " Does that matter ? " And Mrs. Dersingham turned away . Into the silence that fell now there came the voice , quavering a little , of Mrs. Pearson . " Now I really think it 's time we were going , " it began . But nobody took any notice of it . ANGEL PAVEMENT 125For Lena burst into a torrent of speech . " No , it does n't matter , of course . But I just asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came , because you 've just been as rotten as you could be , and I did n't ask to come  --  I 've been travelling half the day and I 'm as tired as you are  --  and I would n't have come at all if my father had n't told me to , and I thought you were friends of his , but from the minute I came in , you 've not said a decent word to me or given me a decent look " Hoy ! " roared her father , seizing her by the arm and shaking her a little . " What the blazes is all this ? What 's the matter with you , girl ? That 's not the way to behave " No , and that 's not the way to behave either , " cried Lena , shakingherself free . " What have I done ? I did n't want to push myself into her beastly house . " And then she grabbed her father 's arm and burst into tears . " I 'm going , " she sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm round her and she continued her sobbing on his shoulder . " Sorry about this , " he said , over her head . " My fault , I expect . I ought n't to have told her to come . The kid 's a bit nervy  --  tired , y'know . " " Yes , of course  --  travelling and all that , " said Mr. Dersingham , feeling that some reply was expected . This was Mrs. Dersingham 's chance , but she did not take it . She might have accepted the apology if her husband had not been so ready to accept it and make an excuse for the girl . But now she turned her back on Mr. Golspie and his terrible daughter , and said to Mrs. Pearson : " Must you really go ? It 's quite early , you know . Oh , Mrs. Trape , you 're not going , are you ? Why ? " And it was well done , bravely done , but it was a mistake , perhaps the biggest mistake she ever made . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying out of it at once . " All right , " he said shortly . " Come on , Lena , shake yourself up a bit . We 're going now . Good-night , all . See you in the morning , Dersingham . Good-night . " And immediately he marched himself and his daughter out of the room , and , a min-126 A N G E L P A V E M E N Tute later , before Dersingham had followed him up , out of the house . Half an hour later , the Dersinghams were alone , and Mrs. Dersinghamwas curled up in the largest chair , crying . " I do n't care , I do n't care , " she sobbed . " They were awful , both of them . The man was nearly as bad as his terrible daughter . They were ghastly , and I hope to Heaven I never see either of them again . Or any of those people , except Mrs. Pearson . Oh , what a horrible , ghastly evening ! " " I know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovering about vaguely and trying to be consoling . " Everything went wrong . I know . " " No , you do n't , you ca n't possibly know how awful it was for me . No , do n't touch me , leave me alone . I just want to go miles and miles away , and never see anybody for months . Do n't ever let me see those vile Golspies again . And I do n't care what I said or did . It could n't be too bad for them . Next time , if you want to invite anybody from Angel Pavement , invite the clerks and the typists , anybody before those awful Golspies . " " There , there , " said Mr. Dersingham , " there , there , there . " And when dialogue is reduced to this , it is time we quitted the scene . Lena , in the taxi that carried them away from Barkfield Gardens , had stopped crying and was now fiercely resentful , like the spoilt child she was . " Well , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half her beastly dinner had been dropped outside the door ; I did n't even know until you told me ; and it was probably a good job for you , it was dropped , for I 'll bet it was the most awful muck . But there was n't one of these old cats who gave me a decent look or spoke a decent word to mc . You ought to have seen that long thin bony one when I asked her what she was looking so funny about ! And you need n't think it was only me they did n't like , either . They did n't like you , I could see that . They were n't real friends , any of them . " " Who said they were , young woman ? " her father demanded . " Do n't make such a palaver about it . I know all about ' em .

If Dersingham 's wife does n't think we 're good enough for them , let her go on thinking so . I 'll bet she thinks I 'm good enough to keep on putting some ginger in that half dead concern of theirs . After what I 've seen of the Dersingham end of Twigg and Dersingham , all I can say is that Twigg , whoever he was , must have been a dam ' smart chap to have got the firm going at all . " " You do n't mean to say you 're making money for those blighters ? " cried Lena , winding an arm round his . " The people I 'm going to make money for , " replied Mr. Golspie grimly , at the same time squeezing the arm , " are these people , these two here . Just you keep quiet and leave it to me , Miss Golspie . " Chapter FourTURGIS SEES HERIT uRCIS was not lazy and while he was in the office he preferred doing something to doing nothing , but he did not share Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the firm . It was all very well for Twigg &; Dersingham to be suddenly busy again , indeed much busier than they had ever been before , but Turgis did not see the fun of going hard at it all day and every day and frequently having to stay an hour later . No doubt somebody was doing well out of it , but he , Turgis , was getting nothing out of it but a great deal more work . He grumbled about this to Mr. Smeeth . It was Saturday morning ; he had just received his fortnight 's pay , six pound notes , one ten-shilling note , and two florins ; and it was a time for such confidences . " All right , all right , " said Mr. Smeeth , with the manner of a person who knew a great deal . " That 's your point of view , is n't it ? " Turgis , a little diffidently now , for he had a considerable respect for Mr. Smeeth if no particular liking for him , replied that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , " Mr. Smeeth continuedgravely . " Just a week or two ago -- -I 'll tell you exactly what day it was ; it was the day Mr. Golspie first called here  --  Mr. Dersinghamwas talking things over with me , in that room there . I 'm telling you this in confidence , mind . And Mr. Dersingham said the office expenses were too big and somebody would have to go . And it looked as if that somebody would be you . " ANGEL P A V E M E N T 129 " Me ! " Turgis 's mouth , always open a little , was now wide open , for his jaw suddenly dropped . " You , Turgis , " said Mr. Smeeth , with the satisfied air of a man who has produced the desired effect . " It was touch and go whether I told you that very day . I 'm glad I did n't because you might have got a fright for nothing . Now it 's all right , of course . We 're busy , and we need everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extra work , my boy , just you remember that . You might have been looking for work now , and I 'll bet you would n't have liked that , would you ? " " No , I would n't , Mr. Smeeth , " replied Turgis , humbly enough . " And I do n't blame you . " Feeling fairly confident , for once , about his own job , Mr. Smeeth had a great desire to enlarge upon this topic , which had for him a terrible fascination . " Jobs are n't easy to get , are they ? " " Not if you have n't influence and you 're not in the know , Mr. Smeeth , " said Turgis , who was a great believer in the mysterious power of influence and being in the know , and realised only too well that there were few people in London who had less influence or were further from the know than himself . " That 's the trouble . I seen it myself . You ca n't get a look in . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  before I got taken on here . Trailin ' round , queueing up , round again  --  oh , dear !

Oo , it 's sorful , " cried Turgis earnestly . " ' S'not getting any better either . Well I 'm glad you told me , Mr. Smeeth . I 'd better keep my mouth shut a bit , had n't I ? It is all right now , is n't it ? " " Quite all right . You do your best for us , " Mr. Smeeth , added sententiously , " and we 'll do our best for you .

And if you could  --  just  --  you know  --  say something to Mr. Golspie or Mr. Dersingham , because , you know , Mr. Smeeth , I am doing my best , and you must n't think I want to grumble , ' cos I do n't . " The new typist had been a great disappointment to Turgis , not because she was of no assistance to him in his work but because she was not the attractive young creature his heated fancy had conjuredup to fill the post . Miss Poppy Sellers , with her unfortunate Oriental effect which merely resulted in dinginess and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of the first morning , though he was flattered by her awe of him , he had dismissed her as a very poor bit of girl stuff . When he had heard that the firm was advertising for another typist , Ra younger girl to help Miss Matfield , he had had instant visions of working side by side with one of those really pretty ones he often noticed making their way about the City . There were one or two good ones in Angel Pavementitself : quite a pretty piece downstairs with the Kwik-Work Razor Blade Co. ; another not so dusty who went up the stairs next door to C. Warstein : Tailors ' Trimmings ; and a real beauty  --  one to make your mouth water , a peach  --  at Dunbury &; Co. : IncandescentGas Fittings , at the end of the street . And there were two or three worth looking at , the flashy young Jcwcssy type , at Chase &; Cohen 's Carnival Novelties place at the end . Any one of these girls , walking into Twigg &; Dersingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the day 's routine would have become an adventure . But they must go and choose this dreary-looking kid with the fringe . It was just his luck . Two girls working in the same office , and neither of them any good . Miss Matfield was all right in her way , of course , but then she was too big , too old , and far too " posh " and bossy for him , even if she had ever showed any sign  --  and , so far , ANGEL PAVEMENT 131she had n't  --  of being really interested in his existence . This other one , Polly Sellers , was interested enough , quite ready to be friends , but then , well  --  look at her . The maddening thing about it  --  and it really was maddening to Turgis  --  was that all these other ripe and adorable girls ( he thought of them as " fine bits " ) were all over the place , walking in and out of offices , sitting in corners of teashops , elbowing him sometimes ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tube trains , so that you might have thought they worked for everybody in the City but Twigg &; Dersingham . And it was no better , perhaps it was worse , when he was roaming about for pleasure and not simply going to and from the office . Everywhere he saw them , never missed seeing them . His mind was for ever busy with their images , for ever troubled by them . No matter where he went , he was tantalised , the path underneath his feet a narrow dusty track of wilderness but all hung about with rich forbidden clusters of feminine fruit , shrinking , withering , vanishing , at a touch . Turgis was by temperament a lover . His thoughts never left the other sex long ; happiness had for him a feminine shape ; the real world was illuminated by the bright glances of girls ; and at any moment , one of them might reveal to him an enchanted life they could share together . It would be easy to see him as a lonely lad seeking sympathy in that crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easy to see him as a figure of furtive lusts , whose mind descendedand there lived eagerly in an underworld of tiny mean contacts , seemingly accidental pressures of the arm and the foot . Yet behind both these figures was the lover . And this , in spite of his shabbiness and unprepossessing looks , the shiny baggy suit , and the frayed tie , the open mouth , that slight pastiness and spottiness , that faint grey film which seemed to cover and subdue his physical self . He was no dapper lady-killer . But then if Turgis , even with his scanty means , did not try very hard to make himself superficially attractive to the sex that despises crumpled clothes , matted hair , pasty cheeks , youth that has lost all vividness and glow , it was be-132 ANGEL PAVEMENTcause he believed that the cry from within , urgent , never ceasing , must receive an answer . He knew that he had little to offer on the surface , was nothing to look at , nobody in particular , but he felt that inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later a girl , a beautiful and passionate girl , caring nothing for the outside show , would recognise this difference , this wonder , within , would cry , " Oh , it 's you , " and love would immediately follow . Then life would really begin . So far it had not begun ; in the tangle , blather , jumble of mere existence , of eating , sleeping , working , journeying and staring , it had only made a number of false starts . In other words , Turgis had had his little adventures but was not yet in love , or rather  --  for he was perpetually in love  --  had not yet found the single outlet for all this flood , the one girl . After returning to his own desk , Turgis thought about these other girls who might so easily have come to work by his side instead of continuing with the Krvik-Work Razor Blade or Danbury &; Co. , and then , dismissing them reluctantly , he began to tNy up his desk and finish off the week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . He leaned forward on his high stool , and breathed hard over communications from the London and North Eastern Railway and the City Transport Company . There was a girl at the City Transport  --  he had never seen her but she often answered the telephone  --  who sounded nice , lovely voice she had , and once or twice he had made her laugh . If he had been in the office by himself , he would have talked to her properly , perhaps suggested an appointment  --  on the pictures they called it a " date " but Turgis thought of it as a " point "  --  but he was never alone , and even if there was only that silly kid , Stanley , there , it would spoil it . But it was fine to hear her laugh down the telephone . Silvery , that was it  --  silvery laughter  --  her silvery laughter  --  just like in a book . He was interrupted by a touch on his arm , and he looked round to find the new typist at his elbow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a lot of powder on one side of her nose , and none at all , just shiny skin , on the other side . No good . ANGEL P A V E M E N T 133 " Please , " said Miss Sellers in her chirpy little Cockney voice , " please , have you written to the Anglo-What's-It Shipping ? " " No , I have n't , " he replied . She merely stared . " I have n't written to the Anglo-What's-It Shipping , " he continuedseverely , " because I 've never heard of the Anglo-What's-It Shipping . Do n't know them  --  see ? " " Oo , I 'm sorry , " though she did not sound very sorry . " Have I said something wrong ? I ca n't remember all these names yet . Give me a chance . You know who I mean , do n't you ? It is Anglo-something , is n't it ? " " If it 's the Anglo-Baltic Shipping Co. you 're talking about , " said Turgis with dignity , " then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s'matter of fact . But to the Anglo-Baltic , mind you . There 's no what's-it about it . " The girl looked at him for a moment . " Oo ! " she cried softly , " squashed ! " And then she promptly walked away . Turgis glanced after her with distaste . " Getting cheeky now , " he told himself . " That 's the latest  --  getting cheeky . And just because she ca n't make up to me . All right , Miss Dirty Fringe , you 'll have to be told off soon , you will . Try it again , that 's all , just try it again . " And he was filled with a righteous indignation , pointing out to himself that these girls did n't know their place in an office , would n't get on with their work properly , and were always trying their little tricks on men who wanted to do their job with no nonsenseabout it . There was a familiar scurrying , as of some small animal of the undergrowth that had got itself shod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Stanley had returned . " Come on , boy , come on , " said Mr. Smeeth , looking over his eyeglasses . " Get those letters copied , sharp as you can . Do n't want us to be here all day , waiting for you , do you ? " " I want to get the one-five from London Bridge , if I can , Mr.ANGEL PAVEMENT 135 " If you do n't finish those letters in ten minutes , " said Mr. Smeeth , wagging a finger at him , " you 'll be in the dock , and never mind being a witness . How are you getting on , Turgis ? " " Nearly finished , Mr. Smeeth , " Turgis replied . " I 'll just give the City Transport a ring to see if they 've heard anything about that lot we sent to Norwich . " And he promptly went to the telephone . There was no silvery laughter this time from the City Transport Company . The voice that answered him was not only a masculine voice but also an irritated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who was rapidly coming to the conclusion that he would be spending all Saturday afternoon answering idiotic inquiries . " Yes , I know , I know , " it barked . " You rang me up before about it . Well , we 're doing our best . We 've got the matter in hand . Yes , yes , yes , I 've told our Norwich people . I 'll let you know on Monday . The first thing , the very first thing , on Monday , I 'll let you know . " It was pleading now . " Ca n't do more than that , can I ? " And now it was tired of pleading . " All right , all ri-ight , we 're doing what we ca-a-an . Ring you on Mo-o-onday .

" 136 ANGEL PAVEMENTand buses , no longer clamouring for a few more yards of space , would come gliding easily through misty blue vacancies like ships going down London River ; and the whole place , populated only by caretakers and policemen among the living , would sink slowly into quietness ; the very bank-rate would be forgotten ; and it would be left to drown itself in reverie , with a drift of smoke and light fog across its old stones like the return of an army of ghosts . Until  --  with a clatter , a clang , a sudden raw awakening  --  Monday . Papers were swept into drawers , letters were stamped in rows , blotters were shut , turned over , put away , ledgers and petty cash boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powdered , cigarettes and pipes were lit , doors were banged , and stairs were noisy with hasty feet . The week was done . Out they came in their thousands into Angel Pavement , London Wall , Moorgate Street , Cornhill and Cheapside . They were so thick along Finsbury Pavement that the Moorgate Tube Station seemed like a monster sucking them down into its hot rank inside . Among these vanishing mites was one with a large but not masterful nose , full brown eyes , a slightly open mouth , and a drooping chin . This was Turgis going home . He had to stand all the way , and though there were at least five nice-looking girls in the same compartment  --  and one was very close to him , and two of the others he had noticed several times before  --  not one of them showed the slightest interest in him . IIWhen Turgis returned again to the earth 's surface , he plunged at once into the noise and litter of High Street , Camden Town , and then turned up the Kentish Town Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that conglomeration of short streets between the Kentish Town Road and York Road . He was rather later than usual , for this new Golspie business was having its effect even on Saturday morning , and so he walked quickly for once . He was ready forANGEL PAVEMENT 137dinner and he knew that dinner would be ready for him . On Saturdaysand Sundays , his landlady provided dinner as well as breakfast , and , indeed , was not averse to laying out a bit of tea , too , if that should be called for , Turgis having been with her now for eighteen months and having proved himself to be  --  by Nathaniel Street standards , which are based on a bitter knowledge of this world  --  a good quiet lodger , sober , and punctual in his payments . During the week , he had , officially , nothing but breakfast in the house , and had to shift for himself for his other meals , which followed a descending scale of luxury every fortnight , beginning with the alternateweek-ends when he was paid . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well fed , and every other Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , he was comparatively half starved . At a pinch , however , his landlady would always give him a little supper . They were all frikdly together . They had to be , for they all used the same back room for meals . The bed-sitting-room that Turgis had at the top of the house , so small that the iron bedstead , the yellow washstand , the three deal drawers , the lopsided and groaning basket chair , and the little old gas-fire , a genuine antique among gas-fires , made it seem uncomfortably crowded with furniture and fittings , was no place in which to feed . It did not like being sat in , resented the sight of a cup of tea and a biscuit , and the presence of one good plateful of roast beef , potatoes , Brussels sprouts , and gravy , would have completely finished it . Number 9 , like all the other houses in Nathaniel Street , was small and dark , and its gloomy little hall was haunted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers . Turgis never noticed this smell , but on the very rare occasions when he visited some other and less odorous house , then he noticed the absence of it , his nose declaring at once that it had found itself in an unfamiliar atmosphere . Now he hung up his hat and coat and marched straight into the back room . There he discovered his landlady , who , having finished dinner , was enjoying a cup of tea by the fire . She was not enjoying this cup of tea , however , in an easy leisurely fashion ; she138 ANGEL PAVEMENTwas sitting , almost tense , on the very edge of the chair ; and she had something of the air of a cavalry general between two phases of a battle . Mrs. Pelumpton had every right to such an air . She was a short and very broad woman , with a mop of untidy grey hair and a withered apple face , and it was easy to see that all her adult life had been one long struggle , and that unless she suffered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would die fighting . In her presence , progress seemed the most absurd myth . If Mrs. Pelumpton could have been turned into the wife of a marauding viking or one of the women following Attila 's horde , she would have felt she had been given a well-earned rest and would have been astonished at , perhaps horrified by , the sudden colour and gaiety of life . As soon as she saw Turgis she put down her cup and , as it were , jumped into the saddle again . She placed on the table two covered plates , her lodger 's dinner , meat and vegetables under one cover , pudding under the other . " I 'm a bit late to-day , Mrs. Pelumpton , " said Turgis , settling down . " Well , I said to myself you might have been or you might not , according to whether that clock 's gone and got fast again , and it might well have done that , the way he 's been playing about with it . " " About quarter of an hour fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And that , " said Mrs. Pelumpton very decisively , " is what comes of messing about with it . Leave it alone , ' I told him . Clocks is n't in your line . ' Not that quarter of an hour 's going to hurt anybody in this house  --  except Edgar , and he 's got his own watch with proper railway time on it . " Edgar , her son , who also lived in the house , worked on the railway down at King 's Cross . Turgis rarely saw him . " That 's a nice bit o ' meat you 're having there , Mr. Turgis , is n't it ? " Mrs. Pelumpton continued , after taking a noisy sip of tea and then staring over the cup at him . " Chilled , that is . You 'd have thought that was English if I had n't told you , would n't you ? " ANGEL PAVEMENT 139 " Yes , I would , Mrs. Pelumpton . " " Well , I wo n't deceive you . It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picking . Take what they offer , and you do n't know where you are . You 've got to look about a bit and pick it yourself . They know me now . " And here Mrs. Pelumpton produced a short triumphantlaugh . " They know me all right . Pick where you like , Ma , ' he always says to me . Oh , I 'll watch it , ' I tells him . I ' 11 watch it . ' And I do . " " That 's the style . It 's a very nice dinner , Mrs. Pelumpton . " A certain shuffling noise indicated that the master of the house , the messer-about with clocks , Mr. Pelumpton , was now approaching . Mr. Pelumpton moved very slowly , partly because he suffered from rheumatism , and partly because he was a man of great dignity . To look at him , at his slack and dingy figure , at his watery eyes , bottle nose , ragged and drooping grey moustache , to mark his leisurely air , was to imagine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not work themselves but merely see that their wives and children work for them . But this was not the truth . Mr. Pelumptondid work , as his talk would quickly inform you . He wt 's a dealer . He had no shop of his own , but he had some vague connection with a shop , where an astonishing variety of second , third , or fourth hand goods were sold , owned by a friend of his . He passed his time in a dusty underworld in which battered chests of drawers and broken gramophones changed hands and the deals were in shillingsand the commission in pence . He interviewed parties who had for sale a cracked toilet set or an old bicycle or five mildewed volumes of The Stately Homes of England . He could sometimes be found in the humblest auction rooms , ready to bid up to half a crown for the odds and ends . Every Friday he became a bonafidemerchant by making an appearance in Caledonian Market , where , on that grey and windy height , he stood beside a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tutor , two chipped pink vases , a silk underskirt , a large photograph of General Buller , five dirty tennis balls , a zither with most of the strings missing , and140 A N G E L P A V E M E N Tthe Letters of Charles Kingsley . Dealing thus in things that were only one remove from the dustbin , Mr. Pelumpton did not contrive to make much money , and indeed he had been dependent for some time on Mrs. Pelumpton and Edgar ; but , on the other hand , you could not say he did not work . He was in the second-hand trade , in the buying and selling line , a legitimate dealer , and took himself and his mysterious business with enormous seriousness . If he was not doing very well , that was because trade was so bad . Mr. Pelumptonhad all the deliberation and dignity of an antique merchant prince . He smoked a foul little pipe , liked a glass of beer , was a great reader of newspapers , and always talked in a very solemn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have drooping moustaches , very few teeth , and a confidentialmanner , he softened all the sibilants , putting an " h " behind every " s . " There is no doubt that a dealer who can only say " Yes " is not in such a strong position as the dealer who can draw it out into a mysterious " Yersh . " Mr. Pelumpton was essentially a " Yersh " man . He now advanced very slowly into the room , carefully seated himself by the fire , took out his evil little pipe , looked at Turgis in a watery fashion , nodded solemnly , put back his pipe , and waited for somebody to ask him something . " Well , did you catch him in ? " his wife inquired . Mr. Pelumpton was always having to slip round the corner to catch somebody in , even if he had only just finished his own dinner . " Out till five , " replied Mr. Pelumpton . " And a shaushy ansher for me trouble . " " Who 's bin giving you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Pelumpton , " if it ish hish mishish . Ca n't expect to find ' im in on Shaturday afternoon , ' she shaysh to me . You 'll excuse me , mishish , ' I told her , but in my bishnish , you 've got to work Shaturday afternoon shame ash any other afternoon . Yersh , ' I told her , an ' Shunday afternoon too , if you 're not careful . ' Jusht telling her politely , shee ? All right , what doeshANGEL PAVEMENT r41she shay to that ? She shaysh , Well , we 're diff'rent ' ere , shee ? ' and then shlamsh the door in me faysh . " " The cheeky monkey ! " cried Mrs. Pelumpton indignantly . " I 'd slam it in her face if I 'd anything to do with her . It 's downright ignorance , that 's what it is . There 's people round here has no more idea ' ow to behave than a  --  a  --  a parrot . " " Ar , well , " Mr. Pelumpton continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put with in our bishnish . And you can take that from me , Mishter Turgish . But if the shtuff'sh there , we do n't mind . All in the day'sh work , shee ? " " After something good , Mr. Pelumpton ? " Turgis inquired . " That'sh right . A lovely piesh he'sh got to shell  --  a shideboardoh , a lovely piesh , it ish  --  only wantsh a bit of polishing and it'sh good enough for anybody , that piesh ish , fit for a palash . I ca n't ' andle it myshelf , not ash trade ish now , but I know who can . It'sh a commission job . " " That 's the idea , " said Turgis , with vague approval . He , was a youth who liked to agree with his company , not because he felt kindly disposed towards other people , but simply because it was less trouble to agree and applaud . He really thought Mr. Pelumpton a ridiculous old bore . " Now that 's one thing I 've always wanted , " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideboard , cupboards and all , and room for everything . Mahogany , I 'd like . " " Ah , that'sh what a lot o ' people would like . They 're fetching good money them thingsh are . Show me a good shideboard , a sholid piesh  --  not sho much of your shtuff about it , Mishter Turgish " What 's his stuff , for Heaven 's sake ? " Mrs. Pelumpton demanded . " He has n't got any stuff , have you , Mr. Turgis ? What you talking about , Dad ? " Mr. Pelumpton took out his pipe for this , and looked very reproachfullyat his wife . " What am I talking about ? I 'm talking about what I know , that'sh what I 'm talking about . ' Ow many pieshesh of furnisher have been through my handsh ? Thoushandsh. 142 ANGEL PAVEMENTAll right then . Do n't I know the trade ? Ho , no ! Ho , no ! I do n't know the trade . " Then he pointed his pipe at Turgis , who was very busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very solemnly : " Veneersh . You know what them are . Well , that'sh hish shtuff . Am I right , Mishter Turgish ? " " That 's right , " said Turgis . " That 's what we sell at our place , Mrs. Pelumpton . Veneers for furniture , and inlays , and all that . ' S'matter of fact , I do n't have anything to do with ' em personally , ' cos it is n't my particular job , but that 's what we sell all right . " " Well , I never did ! " Mrs. Pelumpton was filled with honest wonder at a world in which so many different things were bought and sold . " And I never knew that . Thought you was in an office , down in the City , y'know  --  a clurk . " " Sho he ish , " her husband assured her , " but that'sh what hish firm shellsh .

Trade may be bad . Trade ish bad . But for shome thingsh you ' ave a shteady demand , that'sh what you ' ave  --  a shteady demand . Where we 're feeling it in our bishnish ish in the shmall thingsh " Mr. Pelumpton was now settling down to a good long monologue , but he reckoned without his audience , both of whom knew these monologues too well . His wife , seeing that Turgis had finished , pounced upon his used plates and bore them off , with a bustle and clatter that brought a frown to her husband 's face . He now tried to buttonhole Turgis , who was lighting a cigarette . " Now you take me , Mishter Turgish , " he began . But Turgis refused to take him ; he had taken him too often before ; and now he promptly escaped upstairs , to his own room . It is difficult for a room to be both stuffy and cold , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you chose to interfere with it , of being still stuffier or still colder . Turgis , who preferred stuffiness to cold , lit the gas-fire , that tiny antique , which so deeply resented being called into service again that it explodedANGEL P A V E M E N T 143with an indignant bang and then wheezily complained every other second . After the last breath of raw November had been driven out of the room , Turgis took off his collar and his shoes and stretched himself out on the bed . First , he read all the advertisements in his newspaper , which specialised on Saturdays in the mail-order business . There was a whole page of these advertisements , offering everything from Orientally perfumed cigarettes to electric belts for rheumatism , and Turgis carefully read them all . In public he pretended to be very knowing and cynical about advertisements , but in private he was still their willing victim , and nearly every shilling he spent , whether on clothes , drink , tobacco , or amusement , was conjured out of his pocket by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why his suits bagged so soon , his shoes soaked up the rain , his cigarettes shredded and split , and his amusements failed to amuse . When he had done with the newspaper , he took from the mantelpiece ( and he could do this without getting up from the bed ) the latest issue of a twopenny periodical that was devoted to the films , though more especially to the film actors with the longest eyelashes and the actresses with the largest eyes . He spent the next half-hour staring at the photographs in this paper and reading its scrappy paragraphs , not with any particular enthusiasm . Turgis was not really a film enthusiast . He knew nothing about camera angles and " cutting " and all the intricacies of crowd work , and never in his life had he seriously compared one film with another . He could laugh at the comic men with the rest , but he did not fully appreciate the clowning on the screen , simply because he had not a very strong sense of humour . No , what drew him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common enthusiasm , they had both a passionate interest in sex . In those dim sensuous palaces , filled with throbbing music and shifting coloured lights , Turgis the lover entered his dream kingdom . You could say that the money he paid at their doors was silver tribute to Aphrodite , to whose worship the Phoenicians of the Californian coast have built more temples144 ANGEL PAVEMENTthan ever the old Phoenicians of Cyprus did ; and for a few moments , as he sat in the steep darkened galleries , Turgis would be shaken and then intoxicated by the golden presence of the goddess as she flashed through with her train , Eros and the Hours and the Graces , though of all that retinue only two remained with him , to see him home , Pothos and Himeros , shapes of longing and yearning . The paper slipped from his fingers . His eyes closed ; his jaw dropped a little ; and his head turned on the pillow , so that the light of the gas-fire , now coming to life in the dwindling daylight , for the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosily on his features , the pleasant width of the brow , the nose that had missed masterfulness , the round chin that fell away , and as his breathing grew more regular and he slipped into unconsciousness , that light brought something at once grotesque and sad , the red gleam and deep shadow of some Gothic tragedy , into the little room . And for an hour or so Turgis slept , while Saturday went rattling and roaring on , gathering momentum , through the dark little abysses of brick and smoke outside , the streets of London . IIIThe Turgis who came out of 9 , Nathaniel Street , later that Saturdayafternoon , was quite different from the youth we have already met . He was washed , brushed , conscientiously shaved , and he moved briskly . This was for him the best time of all the week . Saturday sang in his heart . If the Great Something ever happened , it would happen on Saturday . The trams , buses , shops , bars , theatres , and picture palaces , they all gleamed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Adventure  --  in high heels and silk stockings  --  mightbe moving his way . He was making for the West End , for on Saturdays , especially the alternate Saturdays when he received his pay , he despised Camden Town and Islington and Finsbury Park , those little centres that broke the desert of North London with oases of flashing lights and places of entertainment . These wereA N G E L P A V E M E N T 145good enough in their way , but if you had a few shillings to spend , the West was a great deal better , offering you the real thing in giant teashops and picture theatres . For this was his usual Saturday night programme , if he had the money : first , tea at one of the big teashops , which were always crowded with girls and always offered a chance of a pick-up ; then a visit to one of the great West End cinemas , in which , once inside , he could spin out the whole evening , perhaps on the edge of adventure all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , too , though , of course , he was always ready to modify it if anything happened in the teashop , if he found the right sort of girl there and she wanted to do something else . At the very time he was setting out , hundreds and hundreds of girls , girls with little powdered snub noses , wet crimson mouths , shrill voices , and gleaming calves , were also setting out  --  nearly all of them , unfortunately , in pairs  --  to carry out the very same programme . Turgis knew this , or perhaps only a hunter 's instinct led him to where the game were thickest ; but he did not visualise them , luckily for him , for the tantalising image would have driven him nearly to madness . But there they were , tripping down innumerable dark steps , chirping and laughing together in buses and trams without end , and making for the same small area , the very same buildings , perhaps to jostle him as they passed . It would have been easier for Turgis , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a companion , to match all these pairs of girls , but he had only a few acquaintances , no friends , and , in any event , he preferred to hunt in solitude , to thread his way through the brilliant jungle alone with his hunger and his dream . A bus took him to the West End , where , among the crazy colouredfountains of illumination , shattering the blue dusk with green and crimson fire , he found the cafe of his choice , a teashop that had gone mad and turned Babylonian , a white palace with ten thousand lights . It towered above the older buildings like a citadel , which indeed it was , the outpost of a new age , perhaps a new civilisation , perhaps a new barbarism ; and behind the thin marble front146 ANGEL P A V E M E N T were concrete and steel , just as behind the careless profusion of luxury were millions of pence , balanced to the last halfpenny . Somewherein the background , hidden away , behind the ten thousand lights and acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousand waitresses and cash-box girls and blackcoatedfloor managers and temperamental long-haired violinists , behind the mounds of shimmering bonbons and multi-coloured Viennese pastries , the cauldrons of stewed steak , the vanloads of harlequin ices , were a few men who went to work juggling with fractions of a farthing , who knew how many units of electricity it took to finish a steak-and-kidney pudding and how many minutes and seconds a waitress ( five feet four in height and in average health ) would need to carry a tray of given weight from the kitchen lift to the table in the far corner . In short , there was a warm , sensuous , vulgar life flowering in the upper stories , and cold science working in the basement . Such was the gigantic teashop into which Turgis marched , in search not of mere refreshment but of all the enchantment of unfamiliar luxury . Perhaps he knew in his heart that men have conquered half the known world , looted whole kingdoms , and never arrived at such luxury . The place was built for him . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as usual , they were all there . It steamed with humanity . The marble entrance hall , piled dizzily with bonbons and cakes , was as crowded and bustling as a railway station . The gloom and grime of the streets , the raw air , all November , were at once left behind , forgotten : the atmosphere inside was golden , tropical , belonging to some high midsummerof confectionery . Disdaining the lifts , Turgis , once more excited by the sight , sound , and smell of it all , climbed the wide staircase until he reached his favourite floor , where an orchestra , led by a young Jewish violinist with wandering lustrous eyes and a passion for tremolo effects , acted as a magnet to a thousand girls . The door was swung open for him by a page ; there burst , like a sugary bomb , the clatter of cups , the shrill chatter of white-andvermiliongirls , and , cleaving the golden , scented air , the sensuousA N G E L P A V E M EN T 147clamour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half dazed , there came , bowing , a sleek grave man , older than he was and far more distinguished than he could ever hope to be , who murmured deferentially : " For one , sir ? This way , please . " Shyly , yet proudly , Turgis followed him . That was the snag really , though . This place was so crowded that you had to take the seat they offered you ; there was no picking and choosing your company at the table . And , as usual , Turgis was not lucky . The vacant seat he was shown , and which he dare not refuse , was at a table already occupied by three people , and not one of them remotely resembled a nice-looking girl . There were two stout middle-aged women , voluble , perspiring , and happy over cream buns , and a middle-aged man , who no doubt had been of no great size even before this expedition started , but was now very small and huddled , and gave the impression that if the party stayed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nose , a collar , and a pair of boots . For the first few minutes , Turgis was so disappointed that he was quite angry with these people , hated them . And of course it was impossible to get hold of a waitress . After five minutes or so of glaring and waiting , he began to wish he had gone somewhere else . There was a pretty girl at the next table , but she was obviously with her young man , and so fond of him that every now and then she clutched his arm and held it tight , just as if the young man might be thinking of running away . At another table , not far away , were three girls together , two of whom looked very interesting , with saucy eyes and wide smiling mouths , but they were too busy whispering and giggling to take any notice of him . So Turgis suddenly stopped being a bright youth , shooting amorous glances , and became a stern youth who wanted some tea , who had gone there for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised and indignant because no tea was forthcoming . " And mindjew , " cried one of the middle-aged women to the other , " I do n't bear malice ' cos it is n't in my nature , as you 'll be the first to agree , my dear . But when she let fly with that , I thought to148 ANGEL PAVEMENTmeself , All right , my lady , now this time you 've gone a bit too far . It 's my turn . ' But mindjew , even then I did n't say what I could have said . Not one word about Gravesend crossed my lips to her , though it was there on the tip of my tongue . " Turgis Iooked at her with disgust . Silly old geezer ! At last the waitress came . She was a girl with a nose so long and so thickly powdered that a great deal of it looked as if it did not belong to her , and she was tired , exasperated , and ready at any moment to be snappy . She took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea , bread and butter , and cakes : the great tea of the whole fortnight  --  without any enthusiasm , but she returned in time to prevent Turgis from losing any more temper . For the next twenty minutes , happily engaged in grappling with this feast , he forgot all about girls , and when the food was done and he was lingering over his third cup of tea and a cigarette , though no possible girls came within sight , he felt dreamily content . His mind swayed vaguely to the tune the orchestra was playing . Adventure would come ; and for the moment he was at ease , lingering on its threshold . From this tropical plateau of tea and cakes , he descended into the street , where the harsh night air suddenly smote him . The pavements were all eyes and thick jostling bodies ; at every corner , the newspaper sellers cried out their football editions in wailing voices of the doomed ; cars went grinding and snarling and roaring past ; and the illuminated signs glittered and rocketed beneath the forgotten faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sovereign Picture Theatre , which towered at the corner like a vast spangled wedding-cake in stone . It might have been a twin of that great teashop he had just left ; and indeed it was ; another frontier outpost of the new age . Two Jews , born in Poland but now Americancitizens , had talked over cigars and coffee on the loggia of a crazy Spanish-Italian-American villa , within sight of the Pacific , and out of that talk ( a very quiet talk , for one of the two men was in considerable pain and knew that he was dying inch by inch ) there had sprouted this monster , together with other monsters thatANGEL P A V E M E N T 149had suddenly appeared in New York , Paris , and Berlin . Across ten thousand miles , those two men had seen the one-and-sixpence in Turgis 's pocket , and , with a swift gesture , resolving itself magically into steel and concrete and carpets and velvet-covered seats and pay-boxes , had set it in motion and diverted it to themselves . He waited now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balcony entrance . It was only a little after six and the Saturday night rush had hardly begun , but soon there were at least a hundred of them standing there . Near Turgis , on either side , the sexes were neatly paired off . There were one or two middle-aged women but no unaccompanied girl in sight in the whole queue . The evening was not beginning too well . When at last they were admitted , they first walked through an enormous entrance hall , richly tricked out in chocolate and gold , illuminated by a huge central candelabra , a vast bunch of russet gold globes . Footmen in chocolate and gold waved them towards the two great marble balustrades , the wide staircases lit with more russet gold globes , the prodigiously thick and opulent chocolate carpets , into which their feet sank as if they were the feet of archdukesand duchesses . Up they went , passing a chocolate and gold platoon or two and a portrait gallery of film stars , whose eyelashes seemed to stand out from the walls like stout black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dim summit of the balcony , which fell dizzily away in a scree of little heads . It was an interval between pictures . Several searchlights were focussed on an organ keyboard that looked like a tiny gilded box , far below , and the organ itself was shaking out cascades of treacly sound , so that the whole place trembled with sugary ecstasies . But while they waited in the gangway , the lights faded out , the gilded box dimmed and sank , the curtains parted to reveal the screen again , and an enormous voice , as inhuman as that of a genie , announced that it would bring the world 's news not only to their eyes but to their ears . " One ? This way , sir , " and the attendant went down , flashing15o ANGEL PAVEMENT ANGEL PAVEMENT 151his light . This was always an exciting moment for Turgis . He might find himself next to some wonderful girl , as lonely as he was , who would talk to him , squeeze his hand , let him take her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb . The great adventure might begin at the end of that pointing pencil of light . On the other hand , he might find himself miserably wedged in between two fat middle-aged people . It was all a gamble , with the odds heavily against the wonderful girl , as he knew too well . But still , there was always a chance , and he never walked down these dark steps behind the electric torch without feeling a mounting excitement . The light pointed along a row , and he followed it , pushing past a dozen indignant knees . The last pair was very stubborn , and he negotiated them without enthusiasm . He had no luck . Here , on one side of him was the owner of the knees , an enormous woman , bulging over her seat , and on the other was a man with a beard and a noisy pipe . And it was too late to change his place now . Once again the miracle had not happened . Gloomily he turned his attention to the news film , and not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was followed by a comedy , all about a lot of silly kids , and he sat there , steadily hating it . He also hated the enormous woman , who laughed so much that great lumps of her hit him on the shoulder . He decided , miserably , that he ought not to have come to the Sovereign . Next time he would give the Sovereigna miss . Stiff with fat women and men with stinking pipes , that 's what it was  --  oh , cripes !  --  awful hole ! And another Saturday night going , gone ! Then came the film of the evening , the star feature , and Turgis soon began to take an interest in it and found himself lifted out of his gloom . It was a talkie called " The Glad-Rag Way , " and it was all about a beautiful girl ( and she was beautiful , for she was Lulu Castellar , one of his favourites ) who went to New York to dance in cabarets and for a time forgot all about her sweetheart , a poor young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turgis , but , unlike Turgis , also contrived to have his hair exquisitely waved at regular intervals . This beautiful girl behaved in the most foolish way . She accepted presents from rich men with ugly leering mouths ; she went out to supper with them and got tipsy , as well she might , for the whole atmosphere consisted sometimes of champagne bubbles ; she attended parties , very late at night , in their flats , and though the rooms in these flats were three hundred feet long and two hundred feet broad , the parties themselves were undoubtedly intimate affairs , at which a girl was able to express herself by dancing on the table and throwing off some of her clothes . Everythingthis girl wore , every movement she made , only called the attention of these leering fellows to some part of her ravishing figure ; and even when she herself had stopped making eyes and smiling at them and undulating round them , with a champagne glass in her hand , her charming legs still insisted on claiming their notice . It was obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mistake , they would assume that she was not a virtuous girl and would act accordingly , to her astonishment and indignation and shame at being so misunderstood , so treated . Meanwhile , the young inventor had received a letter ( and you heard him tear it open ) asking him to come to New York to meet three heavy men who had just been barking at one another about him in the previous scene . It was , as he himself admitted , his " beeg chaince . " His train was still roaring across the screen when Turgis , whose interest had been thoroughly roused , heard a voice say " ' Scuse me " and saw a dim feminine shape that was obviously trying to get past . " ' S'quite all right , " he said affably , withdrawing his knees to let her pass . She dropped into the seat on his left , taking the place of the man with the foul pipe , who must have crept out , towards the other gangway , without Turgis noticing him . This girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he felt sure she was young and pretty. 152 ANGEL PAVEMENT i ANGEL PAVEMENT 153 " ' Scuse me , " she whispered again , " but is this the big picture ? " " Yes , it is , " he replied eagerly . " Has it been on long ? " " No , not so long . It is n't half through yet , I 'm sure , " he told her , trying to talk as if he were a confidential old friend . " I 'll bet the best 's coming on . " " Well , I hope you 're right , " she said , settling herself in the rather narrow seat and then giving her attention to the screen . A faint sweet whiff of scent had come his way . His senses did not wait for any more evidence ; they reported at once to his imagination , which immediately dowered the vague dark figure beside him with all sweetness and prettiness , not unlike that of Lulu Castellar , who was at the moment absent from the screen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked at by the three heavy men . Turgis took in all that the film had to offer him , but now he was no longer lost in it ; he was living intensely in the tiny darkened space between him and the girl . Instinctively , he edged a little her way . Their elbows touched on the arm of the seat , and even that trifling contact sent a thrill through him . A little later , his left leg encountered something at once firm and soft , another leg , a beautifully rounded feminine leg , and the two remained in contact . This , like the other , may have been casual , but to Turgis the effect was electric . And then it chanced that his hand , hanging loose by his side , touched another hand , which was not withdrawn when it was touched again , this time deliberately . The two hands now met fairly ; they grasped one another , squeezed ; their fingers were intertwined ; they sent and received messages in the dark . Turgis could now regard the graceful antics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the screen was nothing compared with the pulsating real life of those contacts in the warm gloom , those little pressures and squeezes that were signals from that other enchanted world . He did not try to talk to her again . That would come later . He said nothing , hardly looked her way , afraid lest he should break the spell . When the film ended and a kind of soft russet dawn broke as the screen disappeared behind the curtains , they moved away from one another , and he did not even catch a glimpse of her face . A great many people went out , and a great many others came in , but they were not disturbed . Then the curtains moved again ; a soft russet twilight came , only to fade into darkness ; and the programme artfully continued . But would this other and far more exciting programmecontinue ? His heart bounded in the new darkness . He leaned towards her again ; she did not evade him ; and hand clasped hand again , stickily perhaps now but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months . It was not until the young inventor 's train to New York was again roaring across the screen , after the programme had gone round its full circle , that the girl loosened her hand and began to put on her gloves . Turgis had been waiting for this moment for some time . When she rose , he rose too ; and she followed him past the indignantknees and up the stairs . It was when they reached the exit steps , descending into the real world , that he turned and spoke to her . And he knew instinctively that they were not now the two people who had been holding hands for so long in the darkness inside ; those two intimates were ghosts now ; these two on the steps , in the light , were strangers and would have to begin over again . When he spoke he acted upon this instinctive or intuitive knowledge . " How did you like the picture then ? " he asked , casually . " I did n't think it was so very good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like that Lulu Castellar . Pulls herself about a bit too much , she does , if you ask me . Might as well have Saint Vitus ' dance and have done with it . Do you like her ? " " Oh  --  I du n no  --  she 's all right , " he muttered . He was recovering from a horrible shock . This girl was not pretty at all , not even reasonably good-looking . She was years older than he was , and she was hideous . He had just caught sight of her face properly for the first time . Her nose was all twisted and she had a bit of a squint . She was thirty if she was a day . Oh , hell  --  what a wash-out ! She154 ANGEL P A V E M E N T was still talking , but he could not bother listening to what she was saying . Sheer vexation made his eyes smart . He kept pace with her down the steps , mumbling an occasional " Yes " and " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who screamed and cursed at everything . " Well , " she said , when they reached the bottom door , " I 've got my sister to meet , so I 'll say good-night to you . " " Good-night , " said Turgis miserably . Saturday night was roaring away outside , but for him the heart had gone out of it . He walked on mechanically , so sorry for himself , so angry with everything , that he could have cried . His head ached from being in that rotten balcony so long . There were queer aches in his body too . Where could he go now ? Nowhere worth going to . If you had plenty of money , evening dress and all that , you could go to restaurants and night clubs and dance with beautiful girls with fine bare arms . But he was n't in that seam . He 'd no evening dress ; no money ; and anyhow he could n't dance . He could n't do anything . No , perhaps he could n't , but he was as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , who just went chucking it away while he had to count every penny . Look at that lot in the big car , with their fur coats and diamonds and white shirt fronts , probably going somewhere to dance and get boozed up and God knows what before they 'd finished ! Swine ! He was as good as them any day . And better  --  he did do some work . What did they do ? It was enough to make any chap turn Bolshie . He did n't like the other chap who lodged at Mrs. Pelumpton'svery much ; Park was a dreary , unfriendly sort of devil , and a Sheeny at that ; but he did n't blame Park for turning Bolshie . For two pins , he 'd turn Bolshie , too . Yes , but what was the good of that ? All this time he had been walking on and on , through a Saturday night with the bottom dropped out of it , and now had left the spangled West End behind him . He stopped at a coffee stall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools were arguing about nothing as usual , and had two buns and a cup of coffee  --  poor stuff it was too , too sweet and nearly cold . As he turned his back to the counter , he saw a girl , a really nice kid with a red hat and big dark eyes , smiling in his direction , and he smiled back at her hopefully , but then he saw her eyes move slightly and the smile instantly vanish . She had not been looking at him before , when she smiled ; she had been looking at the chap standing next to him , who was ordering two coffees . And what a chap to be out with , to be smiling at ! If that 's what she wanted , she could have him . One vast sneer , Turgis moved away , and boarded the first bus he found that would take him to Camden Town , back to Nathaniel Street with the ruins of his evening . " ' Ad a good time , boy ? " said Mr. Pelumpton , now mellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That'sh the way . Yersh . Enjoy yershelf while you 're young , I shay , and while you can enjoy yershelf . I did when I wash your age an ' do n't ferget it , boy . " Here Mr. Pelumpton chuckled and then coughed . " I ' ad a good time and nobody could shtop me ' aving one . " " What 's this about you and your good times ? " said his wife , popping out from nowhere . " I 'm jusht telling our friend ' ere that I do n't blame him for enjoyinghimshelf while he'sh young , ' cosh I did the shame thing when I wash young . " " Ar , you was a wicked devil you was , " said Mrs. Pelumpton , with reluctant admiration . " Oh dear , oh dear ! " Mr. Pelumpton chuckled . " Lishen to that . Ar well , boy , I do n't blame yer . Good old Shaturday night . I 've ' ad ' em . I know . " " I 'll bet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered under his breath . " Only jusht remember thish , boy . Don 'd overdo it , that'sh all . Don 'd overdo it . You 're only young wunsh . Enjoy yershelf , if yer like , but don 'd overdo it . " Turgis looked at him in disgust . " Good-night all , " he said , mournfully , and climbed the chilling stairs to his room . So much for Saturday . IvSunday was fine , that is , there was no rain , sleet , or snow falling . There was also very little sunlight falling , and the streets of Camden Town and Kentish Town were like echoing slatey tunnels . Turgis saw them when he went out to buy a paper and a packet of cigarettes , and as usual he disliked the look of them . They were not very cheerful on a weekday , but they were a pantomime and a bean feast then compared with what they were on Sunday . It was on Sunday that Turgis felt his loneliness most keenly . It must be admitted , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two invitations . The first was from Mr. Pelumpton , who had decided that he must pay a visit to Petticoat Lane  --  " jusht to shee ' ow the shtuff 's goin ' , " he said , with an impressive professional air . He had suggested , with some condescension , that Turgis might like to go with him . Turgis had promptly declined . He had been to Petticoat Lane before , and he saw quite enough of old Pelumpton in Nathaniel Street and had no desire to go to Whitechapel with him , merely to provide him with a listener and some free beer . The other invitation came from his fellow lodger , Park , the Bolshie . Park , a neat dark Jewy sort of chap , quiet and civil enough but with something machine-like and vaguely menacing about him , just as if he was not quite human , worked in the printing trade and apparently had to go at all hours , so that Turgis hardly ever saw him . Moreover , he was a tremendous communist worker , for ever attending meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what seemed to Turgis , who had inspected it , some terribly dreary literature . The two young men did not like each other very much , but Park always saw in Turgis , who had the depressed look of a faintly class-conscious proletarian , a possible convert . Hence the invitation , which this time was for some communist affair , a meeting or two and coffee and cake for the comrades , somewhere out at Stratford or West Ham . Turgis turned it down , though not ungraciously , for though he did not care much for Park , he had a vague kind of respect for him . But he did not see himself with the comrades . Perhaps the real reason was that he could not imagine any girls , real nice girls , not glaring female comrades , in the picture . He did not tell Park so , did not even admit it to himself ; and when Park , with the drab innocence of his kind , accused him of being a timid slave of the bourgeois classes , a would-be bourgeois himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise . The paper kept him amused until dinner time . After dinner he went for a walk , which chiefly consisted of penny bus rides . They finally landed him , as they had landed a few thousand other people , at the Marble Arch corner of Hyde Park , where the Sunday orators congregate . Turgis often visited this forum and listened to the orators . He had no intellectual curiosity and never really attended to the arguments , such as they were , but he had a sort of genial contempt for the speakers that was a warming , comforting feeling . He felt that they were a great deal sillier than he was , and that was pleasant . Moreover , any leisurely crowd always had an attraction for him , because there was always a chance that there might be , somewhere in the middle of it , bored and lonely , a wonderful girl who would suddenly smile back at him . He drifted from speaker to speaker with the crowd , which was largely composed of youths like himself , all feeling pleasantly superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political fanatics . There was a fantastic old man in a greenish frock coat who banged a large chart and talked in a high sing-song that left five words out of six quite unintelligible . His subject  --  of all things  --  was shorthand . Turgis stared at him for a minute or two , concluded that he was mad , and moved on . The next meeting , a158 ANGEL PAVEMENTlarge one , was political , and the only words Turgis caught  --  " What about Russia , where your socialism , my friends , has been put into practice ? "  --  drove him away at once . Then there was a tiny group of people round a harmonium , played by a young man with bulging eyes and a straggling beard . They were drearily singing a hymn , and nobody was taking any notice of them . Next to them , one of those involved discussions , typical of the place , was in heated progress , and the audience , in its own ironical fashion , was enjoying it . All that Turgis , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man with spectacles and long yellow hair who had something to do with the Catholic Church , who kept crying : " One mewment , my friend , just one mewment ! Kindly allow me to speak . Yes , yes , but one mewment ! You have asked me if I would considah such a person insane . Now , one mewment ! " Turgis lingeredfor some time at this meeting . There were one or two nice girls in the crowd , but not one of them was by herself . It was no good . He would have to find a pal . The speaker on the right was being heckled by a woman who looked rather like Mrs. Pelumpton . He was an elderly man , dressed in an old-fashioned black suit , and he was shaking a Bible almost in her face . " Well , what do Ah do ? " he cried , his eyes gleaming . " Ah turn once mo-ore to the graa-aate Boo-ook . Yes , Ah 've a Bahble text for tha-at . " Turgis did not learn what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man 's neighbour , a dirty little fellow with a broad flat nose and an india rubber mouth , who looked like a nasty compromise between Hoxton and Manchuria . " What is thee yighest idee-al of thee yole universe , my friends ? " he was screaming , in a lather of oratory . " I 'll tell you . Thee yighest idee-al of thee yole universe is Man  --  Man . " And he thumped himself on the chest . Turgis did not like the look of him at all . He also did not like the look of the Salvation Army lasses who were conducting the service on the other side . They were all so pimply . They looked as if they were always eating things that disagreed with them . Next to the Army was a bony , shabby chap , a Bolshie , possiblyone of Park 's pals . Turgis had heard him before , and only stayed long enough to make sure that he was on the same tack . He was . " Noo where did communism firrst appearr , ma frien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia  --  oh no ! Noat in England  --  oh no ! Noat in Frrance  --  oh no ! Bu ' in Grreece , ma frien 's , in ancient Grreece , where a mon called Playto wrote a buik called The Repuiblic . Yes , Ah know that this mon should rightly be called Plarto , but if Ah said Plarto , Ah know everybody would be staring at it an ' wondering who this Plarto was , so Ah call him Playto . An ' he was the firrst communist . " It was like listening to a Scots comedian who had gone sour . Turgis moved on , passing with the merest glance a very tiny group that everybody had ignored . There were three of them , two bearded and bare-headed men and a faded woman , and they were standing close together , apparently praying . Nobody was taking any notice of them , except a battered and boosy old actor ( he recited a sort of story that introduced the names of all the successful plays running at the time , and Turgis knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did these people come here ? Who were they ? What did they do at home ? Once more , Turgis concluded they were all mad , but this time the thought did not give him any pleasant feeling of superiority . It depressed him . Suppose he was suddenly taken that way ! But there were roars of laughter coming from the crowd on the right , and above it Turgis recognised another familiar figure , an atheist chap , and quite a turn too . He was a fat young man , with a glittering squint and a nose so resolutely turned up that it could be described as a snout ; and he had a very self-confident perky manner and a shrill voice . Turgis edged himself into the audience . " Now , where was Oi ? Losing me plice , was n't Oi ? " he cried humorously . " Ow , Oi know . Fish on Froiday , thet was it . Whoi dew the Catholics eat fish on Froiday ? They dow n't know . They down'tstrite ! Yew arsk ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oi know . " Here the crowd roared its approval . " It 's in nonner of the old goddess , Froiyer , goddess of plenty . Froiyer  --  Froiday  --  see ?
