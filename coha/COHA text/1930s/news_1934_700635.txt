txt The bank officer whose name could not be recalled by the chief bookkeeper and four assistant bookkeepers of the Harriman National Bank and Trust Company on Thursday was produced in Federal Court yesterday by the government . He was Arnold Colombo , cashier of the Harriman Bank until it closed a year ago , and now continuing as an employe of the Federal receiver in bankruptcy . He testified that he was the unknown officer of the Harriman Bank who initialed $1,393,080 of admittedly false entries in the ac ' counts of depositors , for which the government is now trying Joseph W. Harriman and his vice president , Alfred M. Austin . Mr. Colombo said Mr. Austin told him that Mr. Harriman wanted the entries made . When he initialed the necessary bookkeeping slips on April 25 , 1932 , Mr. Colombo declared , he simply obeyed the orders of his superiors . Did not Question Order . " A day or two later , " he testified , however , " on thinking the matter over , it seemed to me that the transactions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave me . I assumed - they knew what they were doing . " To protect himself against any future questions , he said , he quietly took the bookkeeping slips which he had initialed out of the files and put them in his desk . He could not produce them yesterday , fie testified , because some one had stolen them from . him . Mr. Colombo was the first witness to involve Mr. Harriman . As codefendant , his vice president was involved on Tuesday by Louis Klein of the bond department of the bank , who testified he was the bookkeeper who actually wrote out the false bookkeeping slips , in obedience to orders which , he said , came from Mr. Austin . The five bookkeepers who followed Mr. Klein on the witness stand the next day could testify only that they had actually posted the false entries in the depositors ' accounts in an automatic routine which left no impression in their iminds , except that the bookkeeping slips which came before them must have been initialed by a bank of fileer or they would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the entries were first questioned two months after he initialed them , when Federal banking inspectors finally discovered in June , 1932 , that the funds of the Harriman bank had been increasingly sunk in its own bank stock since the 1929 crash in an effort to maintain a price of $1,500 a share by taking off the market all that was offered . Mr. Colombo ad- mitted he knew that the Harriman bank was buying and selling its own stock during that period . Duplicate Slips Made . To satisfy the demands of the banking inspectors for information about the bank 's dealing in its own stock , which is prohibited by the Federal Banking Law , duplicate bookkeeping slips covering the entries I were reconstructed by Mr. Colombo . He testified yesterday that Mr. Harriman signed these slips and told him , together with three other worried bank officers and the bank attorney , in June , 1932 : " I stand behind anything I told you boys to do . " Mr. Harriman 's present intention to deny that he told them to cover up his bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the outset of the trial on Tuesday . In outlining a defense that Mr. Harriman had attempted only to maintain the bank stock for the sake of the depositors , George S. Leisure , his counsel , said : " Then a. very stupid thing happened ; some one made false entries . " According to Mr. Colombo 's story , Mr. Austin gave him a list of eleven accounts on April 2.5 , 1932 , and said : " Here are the names of depositors to whom Mr. Harriman has sold bank stock . " Mr. Colombo said he turned the list over to Mr. Klein , who made out the actual charge tickets which Mr. Colombo initialed . When he took the initialed tickets from the file later , he testified , he found they had been changed by the addition of the letters " L. 0. , " which meant they were to be posted to each depositor 's ledger account only and the depositor was not to be notified that his supposed order for bank stock had been executed . Says He Reversed Entries . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was told to reverse all these entries three days after they were made . He admitted he was aware that bank examiners for the New York Clearing House had come to the bank the day the supposed sales entries were ordered and had departed when the entries were reversed . He said , however , it did not occur to him that the entries were falsifications to conceal from the examiners the fact that the bank was loaded up with its own stock . When the Federal examiners found it out two months later , however , and wanted to know all about these entries , Mr. Colombq testified , he first discussed the situation with William A. Burke , controller of the Harriman Bank , and discovered that Mr. Burke was in the same difficult position . . He said Mr. Burke told him of acting similarly on Mr. Austin 's orders in December , 1931 , in entering sales of $320,145 of the bank stock , which were reversed a few days later . The witness told of an anxious conference held by Mr. Colombo , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner , another vice president , and finally Bertram L. Krause , attorney for the Harriman Bank . According to Mr. Colombo , " the substance of the conversation was that it did n't look regular to us , and at Mr. Krause 's suggestion I reconstructed the slips for the entries , totaling $1,713,225 , which Burke and I had initialed , and we put them all before Mr. Harriman for his signature . He took some time to think it over and then signed them . He looked at us a long time , and it was then he said : boys t stand d d behind anything I told you Told of Harriman 's Request . On cross-examination , Mr. Leisure asked : " You have only Mr. Austin 's statement in April , 1932 , that it was Mr. Harriman 's wish to have these entries made . " " That is correct , " said Mr. Colombo . Assistant United States Attorney Jacob Rosenblum asked Mr. Colombo then if Mr. Harriman had ever inquired further about the falsified entries between the signing of the reconstructed bookkeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank in November , 1932 . " He never did , " said Mr. Colombo . Mr. Colombo further testified that as bookkeeper of the Harriman Securities Corporation , thelnvestment affiliate of the Harriman Bank , the books of the securities corporation showed no record of the operations ' of the " Harriman Securities Corporation Suspense Account "  --  the title inscribed on a red envelope in the bond department of the bank where its accumulation of bank stock was kept . According to his testimony , the suspense envelope was not an account of the securities corporation but a creation of the bank . The trial will continue before Judge Knox and a jury in Federal court on Monday at 10:30 A. M.
