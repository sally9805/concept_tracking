CNINA has long survived its ancient contemporary , the Land of the Pharaohs ; yet , even after all the centuries , it can not see itself as a whole . True , its vast lands are known collectively as China ; but , what with the barriers of confused tongues and difficult transportation , some of its areas differ from others , even as Formosa differs from Alaska . Nor can one say that China is inhabited only by Chinese . In many of its provinces , especially where its Far West blends into that vaguely defined border of Tibet , there live to-day the aboriginal inhabitants of the land . These are not Chinese , but ancient tribes with distinct languages , some possessing a script , even a literature of their own . Such are the Nosu , Nashi. , Chungkia , and Miaotze tribes . In the extreme west the Tibetans in Chinese territory live with their neighbors , the Chrame tribe , a more or less independent existence . Some such tribes are ruled to this day by their own chiefs . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , governed by hereditary chieftains installed by ancient emperors whose dynasties they have outlived . These chiefs are now in fact an anomaly in China , and before long they must become a thing of the past . Their lands usually lie in vast and remote mountains , with scant agricultural areas , and are therefore unattractive to the Chinese farmer . It is this inaccessibility , as well as the wildness of the tribes themselves , which has deterred the Chinese from occupying or exploiting such lands , although certain of them are rich in minerals . THE CHINESE HOLD THE ABORIGINES IN CONTEMPT Vague notions exist , even in Chinese minds , about these tribes and their lands . Habitually the Chinese dismiss these aborigines by giving them a contemptuous nomenclature instead of calling them by their own proper tribal names . Thus the Nosu they call Lolo ; the Nashi , Moso ; the Chrame , Hsifan , or " barbarians of the west " ; and the Tibetans who live west of the Chrame , in Szechwan and Yunnan , are known to Chinese as Mantzu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designation . Often the Chinese characters employed to denote this derogatory nomenclature are prefixed by the radical or ideograph for " dog , " to show utter contempt for these aboriginal people . I have spent many years among the various tribes in western China . I have explored many of their territories , from the southernmost parts of Yiinnan to the borders of extreme southwest Mongolia and  | the grass lands of northeastern Tibet . Still there remain areas along that vast borderland , such as the homelands of the Ngoloks , the Hsiangcheng , and Konkaling tribes , which are most difficult of access and whose inhabitants have defied Western exploration . Of course , no Chinese dares visit even the frontiers of these lawless bands . In 1926 I explored the region of the Amnyi Machen Range and the gorges of the Yellow River in the southern Koko Nor , having been the first white man to explore the land between the Yellow River and the Amnyi Machen . More recently I was privileged to explore another and even less-known region , the Konkaling district , northwest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain mass , only second in height to Minya Konka and the Amnyi Machen , was then not suspected by the outside world . On my journey to the lama kingdom of Muli in the winter of 1923 , I saw from one of the mountain heights over which my trail led a far-away conglomeration of snow peaks . Later I learned from the Muli king that these peaks were in the land of Konkaling and inhabited by Tibetan outlaws . I could not then venture into that mountain fastness , because the time was winter and because I had not yet established the real friendship of that amiable but stern ruler , the King of Muli . On my return from an expedition in the Koko Nor for the Arnold Arboretum I arranged with the National Geographic Society to undertake the exploration of this unknown mountain range and territory , hitherto a blank on the map ; and it  | is to the credit of that Society that this terra incognita has become geographically known and its unsurpassed scenery pictured not only in black and white , but also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO PRAYER It was my friend the King of Muli who made it possible for me to explore this region of amazing scenery and pious robbers , who turn from pillage to prayer ? and then back to pillage ! Our expedition left Yiinnanfu March 23 , 1928 , with experienced Nashi assistants who had been with me for a number of years . We went first to Talifu and thence to Likiang. where all preparations were made and additional personnel hired for the journey to the Mull kingdom , ten days to the north . I hoped that we could persuade the lama king to request the bandit chiefs of the Konkaling and Hsiangcheng to give us safe conduct , so that we could work unhindered on a survey of that magnificent mountain range . GUNPOWDER BOMBS EXPLODED IN WHITE MAN 'S HONOR On our arrival in Muli we found that the king was residing in the small monastery of Kopati , two days ' journey east ( see page , 12 and 13 ) . Kopati stands at an elevation of ro , 26o feet , on a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muli Monastery and the king 's lama secretary came to escort us from Muli to Kopati . We left Muli on May 28 . The first day out , camp had been prepared by the king 's subjects of the hamlet of Gudduh , at an elevation of 10,40 feet . This camp stood on a small meadow surrounded by a forest of oaks and pines , through which we had glimpses of the canyons of the Litang River to the south . Here we were presented with chickens , sheep , and bags of barley , which the peasants had been ordered to bring . In fact , from the moment we entered Muli territory we enjoyed the friendly monarch 's hospitality . Leaving Gudduh early next day , our trail led through magnificent forests of pines dimly outlined in the mist which en- shrouded us . No wind stirred . Nature was at peace . On that serene morning no voice was heard but the cuckoo 's . A well-graded trail leads to the tiny monastery of Kopati , which no other white man had ever visited . Somber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hilltops back of it . As we approached , the few resident lamas and the king 's attendant officials were lined up near the monastery entrance , composed of graceful trees and rose vines . The lamas bowed and with outstretched hands bade us welcome . Although Kopati is one of the most secluded spots on earth , we were surprised to find ourselves in quarters exquisitely painted and decorated with carved doors and windows . We were hardly settled when the king 's Chinese writer called . With him and the royal secretary we discussed our plans . The king knew from previous letters I had written him from Kansu that I wanted to go to Tatsienlu through his domain , so he had made all arrangements for such a journey . But the expressions of the two men changed when I said I wanted to explore Konka , or Konkaling . They expressed serious doubt as to our ability ever to explore the range or march around its three peaks , because of the bandits . I reminded them that we had valuable presents for the Mull king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-dollar gold piece , the first he had ever seen , I suggested that he diplomatically prepare the king for our unusual request . He left , to return after an hour , a smile lighting tip his face . This boded well for our plans . Then we were escorted to the palace . On arrival at the massive gate , the lamas exploded gunpowder bombs in our honor and we were ushered upstairs into the royal presence ( see Color Plates I and XXIV ) . THE GEOGRAPHIC UNLOCKS GATES TO ROBBER STRONGHOLD Dressed in a yellow satin robe , the king received me , took my hand , and led me to a chair . Two of my assistants had brought forward a number of presents . These  | consisted of many articles of foreign manufacture , including an issue of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE in which had appeared my article on my last journey to Muli , in 1923-24. * These items proved to be the real key that was to unlock the gates to Konka Risumgongba . The king 's realm is surrounded by lawless bandits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe and to the west and northwest are the Konkaling and Hsiangcheng outlaws , who often make inroads into his domain .  | The Icing was exceedingly amiable and friendly ; but after I had told him of our plans he expressed grave fears for our safety , even though arrangements could be made with the bandit outlaws who control Konkaling . THE KING ASKS FOR NEWS OR THE WORLD We talked a long time . He asked many political questions , which showed that , although he is absolutely isolated from the rest of the world , he is fairly well informed as far as China is concerned . Of happenings in foreign countries he was entirely ignorant . He knew nothing of the Bolsheviki or of the murder of the Tsar and his family , nor that the Kaiser no longer rules Germany . Taking advantage of this chance to hear world news , the king sent a lama into the recesses of his palace to fetch several cheap colored prints in wooden frames . One represented all the potentates in power before the World Var . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Diaz of Mexico , and of our own President Taft . One by one , I had to explain what had befallen each of these men . He seemed astonished that so few had managed to hold on to their leadership . I could see that in his mind there arose a query as to his own security . A king in a republic , even if that republic is China , is after all an anomaly . The full measure of his knowledge of the outside world was shown when he asked me to explain another colored print which his secretary brought in . It was a scene out of " Puss in Boots , " in which a few donkeys fully dressed were walking erect as mourners behind a cat 's coffin carried by f our rabbits . ( Do not ask me how  | that juvenile work of art ever reached that remote nook of the world . ) In all seriousness he asked me in what country this might be . I laughed and told him it was a picture out of a children 's story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplanes ! The king , whose curiosity is insatiable , inquired how high people had flown , and if from an airplane flying high over Washington one could see China ; and then , again , why my people had never flown to the moon . It was difficult to keep a straight face and answer all his questions seriously . He now changed the subject and referred to my plans for exploring Konka . He explained that the range is called Konka Risumgongba , after the Tibetan trinity , Chanadordje , Jambeyang , and Shenrezig , who are said to inhabit the three mighty snow peaks . Konka Risumgongba is the mountain god of the outlaws who dwell around the high plateau from which the majestic peaks pierce the sky ( see , also , Color Plate IX ) . BANDITS STOP PILGRIMAGES TO SACRED PEAKS It is the pious wish of every Tibetan to make a pilgrimage to the sacred peaks at least once in his lifetime , circumambulating them , if possible , under the worst weather conditions in order to acquire more merit . The gratification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlaws of Konkaling themselves . It is more than twenty years since outsiders have been privileged to make the pilgrimage around  | the mountain . Should any outsider now venture into Konka land he would be robbed and then slain , after which the Konka outlaws would resume their own pious pilgrimage ! The Muli king blamed the Chinese for this state of affairs . Originally the Konkaling and Hsiangcheng tribal lands were under the rule of a Tibetan prince who had his seat in Litang , between Batang and Tatsienlu . The prince had complete control over his subjects , as has the Muli king to-day over his , and at that time anyone could safely circumambulate the mountain . Hundreds of pilgrims ? men , women , and children ? then went annually around the sacred peaks unmolested , acquiring merit to their hearts ' content . Then came the ambitious Chinese Chao - Erh - feng , with his imperialistic designs . In 1904 he advanced on Tatsienlu , deprived the King of Chiala of his rank and territory , and then destroyed the princely family at Litang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only nine are held to-day by the Chinese , the remainder being ruled by Tibetan outlaws . Under the Litang princes the Konkaling and Hsiangcheng territories had been administered by subchiefs , but after the Chinese " removed " the prince of Litang the country became a stronghold of robbers and outlaws . The Tibetans of this region welcomed the advent of the Chinese military , as it offered them an opportunity to arm themselves . They attacked and murdered the Chinese garrison and seized rifles , pistols , and artillery . Later the Muli king bought  | two fieldpieces from the outlaws . Thus the country became an armed bandit camp . The magistrates whom the Chinese had appointed as civil rulers of the newly acquired territories were looked upon by the Tibetans as harmless individuals . At first they were left unmolested , especially as they were not always stationed in the region to which they were accredited , but near its borders . Now , however , no magistrates remain , the last official having fled to avoid the fate of his predecessor , who was murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands are as independent as those of Konkaling . They are ruled by Sashatimba , a bandit chief who holds forth at the Sangpiling Monastery . Other bandit chiefs assist Sashatimba to rule the land . Together they loot and rob and murder . They even go on journeys of many weeks to hold up caravans or loot peaceful settlements . No Chinese dares to enter the Konkaling or Hsiangcheng territories . Thus , all because the Chinese abolished the princes of Litang , , twenty years of anarchy have followed and commerce between Tibet and China via Batang , Litang , and Tatsienlu has ceased . Anyone traveling on the Litang-Batang highway has to make his own arrangements with the Tibetan bandits . BANDIT POWER HAS GROWN AND SPREAD Konkaling territory is divided into three districts , each ruled by a besi , or headman . They are , in the order of their importance , the Bonzu Besi to the east , the Rem Besi to the north , and Tonyi Besi to the southwest . The last named borders on the Londa River in Muli territory . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , come under the sway of Drashetsongpen , a Hsiangcheng bandit chief and former lama of Chungtien Monastery , in northern Yunnan . Drashetsongpen , after abandoning the priesthood and surrounding himself with  | outlaws , made himself absolute ruler of Konkaling , with headquarters at the monastery ; yet he told me he could only control those whom he could see . This speaks volumes for the character of his subject bandits . Drashetsongpen 's bands go up and down the land , robbing caravans as far from his stronghold as Tatsienlu to the north and Likiang , in Yunnan , to the south . His older brother , Mahoshan , whom I had the doubtful pleasure of meeting , also travels the same territory , posing as a peaceful merchant but selling the loot which his brother accumulates from robbing the caravans . The loot from the northern regions , mainly furs , musk , and rugs , is sold in the south , as in Likiang . The valuable opium from Yunnan , usually looted from Likiang caravans , is sold in Tatsienlu , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be robbed , Drashetsongpen gathers his outlaws , often as many as six or seven hundred mounted men , and robs his neighbors . Frequently he even boldly attacks the large town of Likiang . Being on friendly terms with the Muli king , he rides the king 's roads . He thus crosses Muli territory and attacks either Youngning and the Hlihin tribes or the Tsoso and Chienso chiefs in Szechwan . For years this bandit power has grown and spread , till no so-called lawful authority seems now able to suppress it . A BANDIT STRONGHOLD AMID SENTINEL , PEAKS While we were preparing for the journey to the three sacred peaks . the Tonyi Besi people decided to take vengeance on the helpless Tsoso people . The grievance was an imaginary one . A so-called Living Buddha of the Tonyi Besi district who had taken up his residence in the Tsoso territory died a natural death there ; but the Konkaling outlaws , ever ready for an excuse to rob , declared that the Tsoso people had killed the Buddha to obtain the accumulated gifts presented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition was their second for the same alleged cause ! The Muli king loaned the Tonyi Besi outlaws his roads , and so did the Youngning chiefs -- the latter out of fear , the former out of friendship and perhaps gain . While we were among the sacred peaks , the Tonyi Besi had made a dash to Tsoso land . This necessitated their crossing the Shou Chu River , where they left fifty bandits to guard the cantilever bridge , and thus keep their retreat open . A hamlet and yamen , or official residence of the Tsoso chief , were partly burned and many yak , sheep , domestic cattle , horses , and mules driven off . These the Konkaling bandits managed to take to their stronghold , among the majestic peaks which tower like huge sentinels over Konica land . A few straggling sheep which could not keep up with the departing bandits were picked up by the people of Youngning . As was natural , these were not restored to their rightful owners , as it was difficult for such simple-minded people to decide who their rightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tonyi Besi , who felt much outraged that the Youngning people , whose territory the Konkaling bandits had peacefully crossed to inflict punishment on the Tsoso clan , should dare steal these looted sheep . They demanded seventy head of yak as indemnity . In case this were not promptly paid , they would come and , to quote the Tonyi Besi , " burn Youngning to the ground and kill every man , woman , and child of the Hlihin tribe . " The Muli king , more powerful than the Youngning people and spiritually a person to be reckoned with , usually receives a part of the loot for lending his roads to the outlaws . This keeps his domain more or less immune from their attacks . Yet shortly after our sojourn in the Muli village of Wuashi the robbers came , destroyed the wooden bridge over the Shou Chu , then massacred the Tibetans of Wuashi , and looted and burned the village . The Muli king 's domain is like an unfenced penitentiary , for none of his subjects is allowed to leave the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kingdom become automatically subjects and are henceforth forbidden to quit the Muli borders . Peasant is set to watch on peasant , spy and report . Hence their everlasting cringing and crawling in the presence of the king and even before his lamas . Such a condition does not foster boldness or a fighting spirit : so , as a defense force , the king 's subjects are not to be  | counted on . His only worthy soldiers are those recruited among his Tibetan subjects in the village of Garu , on the border of Konkaling territory . They are a fearless lot , yet neighbors of the outlaws of Konkaling . In times past they have been very arrogant and once even attacked Muli Monastery ( see , also , page 43 ) . The present king , a more fearless man . caused a number of the Garu Tibetans to be decapitated and seven to have their big tendons cut below the knee , to make them cripples for life . The Garu people , however . often do a little raiding of their own across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ourselves the task to explore . It can be seen why Konka Risumgongba had remained a terra incognita ! HIS MAJESTY WRITES TO BANDIT CHIEFS Happily , the king was then on friendly terms with Bandit Drashetsongpen ; so he agreed to write letters to all the big thieves of Konkaling , including Drashetsongpen . He wrote very strong letters . stating that an American expedition wished to visit Konka Risunlgongba and to circumambulate the peaks . He requested that orders be given to their subject bandits to leave us severely alone . While the king assured me that we would have little to fear and could circumambulate the mountain , he begged me not to stay too long on its western slopes . He insisted that we go around as quickly as possible and avoid the monastery of Konkaling proper , situated several days ' journev to the west of Konka . Konkaling. meaning Snow Mountain Monastery . ' houses 400 monks always alert to rob going out periodically on plundering expeditions , then returning to prayers . We had to allow time enough for the king 's letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no great haste to get to the mountain , we accompanies the king from Kopati to Djago , where hi brother-in-law , who is commander-in-chief of his army , resides . I could not learn . how this Tibetan of low origin , once horseboy and later cook to the king . rose to his present high position . Every lama asked evaded my questions , at first looking puzzled and then smiling and professing ignorance . It was , however , whispered to me that once Mr. Chang , which is the commander 's Chinese name , followed the lucrative profession of banditry . His daring apparently brought him the commandership of the king 's forces ( see Color Plate XV ) . We left Kopati on June I for Djago , whither the king preceded us by a couple of hours . The trail led first through dense virgin forest of spruce and hemlock , with rhododendron undergrowth . Finally it emerged into a tree-fringed , circular basin , in the center of which stood a massive house called Trashi Konser , so named after a famous Lhasa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were welcomed with the explosion of more powder shells and ushered into the mansion , where we stayed some time to give the Konkaling bandits a chance to digest the contents of the king 's letters . No reply came from them , and in due time we went on to luli onastery and made final plans for our eventful journey . OFF AT LAST June 13 we quit Muli with 36 mules and horses and 21Nashi assistants ; also , we took a soldier escort and a most useful person , the head lama of Muli Monastery , detailed to the expedition by the king . This lama was like a magician in fairy tales . Without him we would have starved . Of course , we paid for everything ; yet only through his commands and influence could food be obtained in that lean and hungry country ( see Color Plate XXIV ) . From Muli we made our way around Mount Mitzuga , the mountain god of the Muli people . Back of the fantastic limestone crags which form the crenelated crest of that 16.000-foot range we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purple-flowered rhododendron hushes , with lovely primulas encircling the loamy banks like huge wreaths . Among the crags are rare birds , including a large rose finch peculiar to altitudes of 15,500 feet . Here , also , is the home of malu , or wapiti. a species of elk which the king protects , forbidding his peasants to kill it under penalty of a severe beating with wooden paddles ! Larches form the last tree-growth on the western slopes of Mount Mitzuga . Here the air is cool and pleasant ; the trail leads clown zigzag through wonderful forests of firs , spruce , and oaks , with many species of rhododendron undergrowth . Various  | green shades of the trees contrast marvelously and are enhanced by long streamers of pale-yellow lichens ( Usnea longissima ) which festoon every branch . The clear atmosphere and the many varicolored rhododendrons , with their undergrowth of primulas and peonies , form indeed a garden fit for gods ( see , also , Color Plates III , XXII , and XXIII ) . The trail finally leads to the yellow pines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Shou Chu , or Iron River , its name being derived from its iron-bearing soils , flows at the very foot of the Konkaling Range , some 10,600 feet below the peaks ( see Color Plate XXII ) . Above , ice and snow , and glaciers ; along the Shou Chu , a temperature of 102 ? Fahrenheit . The sources of the Shou Chu , hitherto erroneously believed to exist in the Konkaling peaks themselves , are actually eleven days ' journey to the north , in Hsiangcheng territory , and flow parallel to the Litang River in terrific gorges . Several of its tributaries , however , flow from the Konkaling Range , such as the Ren Chu , Ton Chu , and Konka Chu . All these rise in the Konkaling peaks . THE FIRST WHITE MAX TO VISIT THE KONKALIXG PEAKS Our party was the first to set foot on the Konkaling plateau , explore the majestic  | peaks rising from it , follow its rivers and gorges , and climb to its glaciers . In 1909 Jacques Bacot visited the Konkaling Monastery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . en route to Sangpiling ; but he was not " favored by the gods , " for he met torrential rains and never learned of the existence of the peaks . Neither H. R. Davies nor F. Kingdon Ward . both of whom saw the peaks from a distance , was privileged to visit them . Davies , in his book on Yunnan , mentions these peaks , but not by name , nor does he show them on his excellent map of Yunnan Province . He glimpsed the Konkaling peaks when marching from Kulu to Muli , but makes no further reference to them . We found the stifling heat in the gorges of the Shou Chu next to unbearable , especially as we passed from cool forest regions to a temperature of over Too ? Fahrenheit within a couple of hours . The Hsifan tribe , in Muli territory proper , do not frequent the Shou Chu Valley , which is inhabited by the Shuhin , or Iron People . The Shuhin are of Nashi origin , but speak a language of their own , which seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet it is not understood by any of the three . Before descending from the region west of Mount Mitzuga into the Shou Chu , our trail led over alpine meadows at an elevation of 15,000 feet . Here we found a great variety of wild flowers ? anemones , blue poppies , and many primroses of all colors , forming a veritable carpet of exquisite designs . Our journey would have been enjoyable had we not been attacked , every time the sun appeared from behind a cloud , by huge horseflies , which preyed not only on our animals but on us . Our caravan traveled rapidly , for the flies made our mules step lively . DIFFICULTIES OF A COLOR PHOTOGRAPHER IN THE FIELD Having exposed several color plates of the wonderful alpine meadows and of our camp , we halted to develop them in the rhododendron forest which surrounded us . Tying our black developing tent to the branches of rhododendrons in the dense shade of the large trees , then laden with wonderful pale pink flowers , I started developing the plates .  | We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate impurities . Color plates are hard to handle , even in a well-equipped laboratory , and in a tent without light or running water , in a camp at 14,500 feet elevation , the difficulties were multiplied manvfold . The drying of the plates was particularly difficult , owing to the cool , moist air and the myriads of midges and flies bent on resting on the emulsion , where they became entrapped . I ordered one man to keep a cardboard waving over the plates , to drive the insects off , but the air current dislodged tiny specks of humus or moss from the rhododendron trunks , often spoiling the results . In Muli land the timber line extends to 15.500 feet . Spruces , firs , and larches are found up to 15,000 feet , while for the remaining 500 feet vast rhododendron forests composed of trees 25 to 30 feet in height cover the spurs and ridges . GOLD IS MINED ON THE SHOU CHO From Camp Gohotsi , on Mount Mitzuga , we descended through magnificent virgin forests of spruce and hemlock with marvelous rhododendron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamlet on the northern slopes of Mount Mitzuga . From Rutuh down , the laud becomes arid and the temperature unbearably hot as one descends to Shendzong , the first Shuhin hamlet . At the spot where an iron chain bridge once spanned the Shot ' Chu , there is now a cantilever bridge not worthy of that name . The two log extensions from the river banks sag terribly on one side and the three narrow planks which span the central part of the bridge are loose . There is no railing to help keep one 's balance ; the loose planks act like springboards , swaying at every step ? one down , one up ( see illustration . page 29 ) . Below , in its rocky chasm , several thousand feet deep , roared the muddy waters of the Shou Chu , a terrific torrent with whirlpools . The wind howled hot , as from a furnace . That we lost nothing crossing that apology for a bridge was indeed a miracle , when one considers that even seasoned muleteers passed over the precarious structure on hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the edge of the central span and , abandoning the loaded , swaying mule , make hastily for the other side . The trail leads steeply along the almost vertical valley walls of the Shou Chu , from terrace to terrace , on which the hamlets of the Shuhin tribe are built . Tiny strips of land are planted to rice or maize . The Shou Chu is rich in gold , which was mined here by Mutienwang the great Nashi king , several hundred years ago . Gold washing and mining activities are now carried on by the Shuhin along the river bank as well as high up on its steep valley walls . The channel of this river bed might be a source of much treasure if dredging operations could be carried out ; but here all work is still clone by human strength , and the resources of this rich country are not even touched . The district below Shendzong is called Lama and comprises several Shuhin villages , each guarded by a watchtower erected hundreds of years ago by the once powerful Nashi kings . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , with flat roofs , permitting one to step from house to house over the entire village ( see , also . page r6 ) . At Lama we camped among bowlders in a veritable yellow jasmine bower , which caused ' me to christen the place " the Jasmine Camp . " At to p.m. the thermometer still registered 8o ? Fahrenheit . Maui piles huge circular pyramids of rock slabs engraved with the sacred prayer , Oni 1nani radn1cc hint ? extend row upon row from one village to the next , testifying to the great leisure of the lama monks , who are responsible for their presence ( see Color Plate XVII ) . High above the roaring torrent , on a tiny terrace overlooking the valley in both directions , stands the tiny Fellow lama monastery of Kana Radja , with twenty monks . They lead a monotonous existence , ever praying and turning wheels and mills of prayers and chiseling prayers into every available flat rock surface . From Kana Radja the trail leads down and over a spur to the Djrahu , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail leaves both the river and the Shuhin tribe . IN COUNTRY NEW TO WHITE MEN We were now on unknown ground , never before trodden by the foot of white man . My Nashi assistants and our lama  | guide and magic provider , as well as I , were eager to penetrate to the mysterious peaks guarded by the Konkaling outlaws . The cheerful indifference with which my Nashi men marched on , knowing of the danger we would have to incur , did not surprise me . They had been with me on an even more dangerous undertaking , when our goal was the sacred Amnyi Machen , in Ngolok land . I owe much of the success of these expeditions to this intrepid mountain race . I could trust them implicitly . Not even in the greatest hour of danger , as when surrounded by boo fierce Chinese bandits , did they show the white feather . And I recall other tests of their courage ? in Kansu1'ebbu land , when we were attacked by a villainous mob : and again in a no-man 's ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a band of 18 Tibetan ruffians who would have made short work of us had we been less swift than they ( see , also , Color Plates V , XII , XXIII ) . Now the Nashi boys were again to prove their mettle on this journey around the Konkaling rSeaks . Here the Muli head lama , now out of his element and no longer surrounded by spiritless serfs , became sore afraid and wished a thousand times he had not cone . Hours of toil and weary marching through the hot canyon brought us finally to a turbulent torrent . the Konka Chu . which had its source in the eastern glacier of Mount Chanadordje. the easternmost peak of the range . One more stiff climb up to a narrow rock ledge which served as trail , and we found ourselves at the Tibetan village of Garu . THE GARU RESEMBLE APACHES What a contrast greeted us here ! The natives , proud and virile kinsmen of the Konkaling outlaws , walked about with an air of insolence and haughtiness which made our lama guide , who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more afraid . The Garu people , tall and well-built men , fearless and open of countenance , resemble Apache Indians , with plaited hair hanging from each side of well-modeled heads . They were friendly , but not subservient . One took heart to be free at last of cringing serfs . We pitched our tents near the house of the headman of Garu , and soon we were surrounded by a smiling group of stalwart tribesmen , every one of whom had killed his man . Here I received the visit of that wily individual , brother of Drashetsongpen , the bandit chief of Konkaling ( see text , page 17 ) . He sat on a rug in my tent , while the Garu people arranged themselves in a circle outside , my watchful Nashi men just behind them . TEIREAT AND SCORN WIN SUPPORT OF ' ESCORT My lama interpreter informed me that the Garu warriors were loath to accept the responsibility of escorting us around the sacred peaks . They explained that not even they themselves had dared to make pilgrimages for fear of the Konkaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them should arm and escort me , they admitted ; but they feared for my life . So , among themselves , they were debating the wisdom of our plans and putting every obstacle in my way to thwart my mission . I found that quick action was necessary , else my plans would be frustrated . I rose , as if in contempt of their cowardice , and said : " Am I to be accompanied by Garu men or women ? " and wrote a Chinese note addressed to the Muli king , in which , as I explained to the lama , I was informing his master that the lama and the Garu soldiers were afraid to escort me . Then I ordered him to secure a runner to carry my epistle to the king . This had the desired effect . Not another word was said about not going . Now , they agreed , they would protect me , even with their own lives ! Our guide betook himself to the monastery above Garu , whither I accompanied him . There he besought his gods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gave half a dollar to a chanting priest to pay for prayers and burned some printed prayercovered papers and juniper boughs to the deity protecting pilgrims .  | I agreed not to take much baggage with me ? only the most necessary supplies ? so as not to tempt the Konkaling bandits . My head muleteer , who had listened to the debate around my tent , had become so scared that he vanished ( luring the night and made his way down the river to Shendzong , with the idea of returning to Muli ; but the Shuhin people detained him , since no one can cross the bridge without permission of the lamas , took his sword from him , and held him for us . A cold and rainy morning found us starting from Garu village . Each of the mounted Garu warriors was armed with rifle and gawu ( portable reliquary shrine ) to protect them against bullets ! Curiously enough , here everyone carries both rifle and gawu , showing that , despite the alleged power of the shrine , they f eel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one enters a fine virgin forest which covers steep slopes to the high plateau of Konkaling . Denser and thicker became the forest as we marched on . Huge trunks of spruce and hemlock rose 15o feet , forming a dense canopy of lacy green , beneath which grew gorgeous yellow rhododendrons . Soon we entered a region where progress was most difficult , for great fallen logs and trees lay helter-skelter over the mountain side , as if a cyclone had mowed the giants down . Every few yards was a deep oval hole wherein a man could hide . These pits , I was told , together with trees which had been felled across the trail , were defense works made by the Garu to help repel the advances of the Konkaling bandits . It was difficult for me to believe that this quiet , beautiful forest could be also a battle ground . At 14.000 feet we came to stands of fir forest and thick-leaved rhododendrons with pink and white flowers . Later these gave way to a forest of rhododendrons , and then to open scrub at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VICTORIOUS ! " Here we crossed a pass , where our lama and Tibetans yelled , " Lha rgellah ! Lha rgellah ! " ( The gods are victorious ! ) Then they hastened to burn juniper twigs as an offering to the sacred mountain Chanadordje , which we were then facing . But clouds enshrouded its hoary head . Proceeding over a rocky trail , we halted on more gentle slopes , and then , at 15,300  | feet , decided to pitch camp . I ascended the spur back of our camp to 16,320 feet , hoping to obtain a view of the other Konkaling peaks , but in vain . Looking east , however , the sky was clear , and more than 200 miles away rose two distinct snow ranges . There was one mighty peak that fairly pierced the sky . Not finding any in that direction on the maps , I then and there decided to spend the following year exploring those mighty snow peals , and to clear up the mystery which hedged them in . The vast snow range I then beheld proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our high camp . I sat in front of my tent , facing the great mountain mass which the Konkaling Tibetans call Chanadordje . Presently the clouds shifted , revealing the glory of the Holder of the Thunderbolt ? a truncated pyramid flanked by broad buttresses like the wings of some stupendous bat . Immense masses of hanging ice and snow extend to the very foot of the mountain , where they form huge moraines resembling a vast amphitheater . This the Konkaling people call Konka Djra-nse , the Sea Dragon 's Snout . It is the source of the glacier stream Konka Chu .. CIRCUMAMBULATING THE SACRED PEAKS To circumambulate these peaks and acquire merit , it is necessary to go from right to left , this being the orthodox fashion of the Yellow sect . Our object , of course , was to make a photographic survey of this most peculiar mountain mass , which , unlike any other known to me , consists of three isolated peaks rising from a triangular plateau . I wished , also , to collect botanical and zoological specimens , as this elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incidentally , in taking animal life on the high plateau , and especially around the peaks , we met immediately with opposition . The Konkaling people objected strongly to our killing birds . To me this seemed peculiar , for they them- selves do not hesitate to kill a pious pilgrim while both they and the pilgrim are devoutly circumambulating the sacred peaks ! We did not strictly heed the suggestion of our escort , but made our collections of animals out of its sight . Our Muli lama was still afraid of the bandits , and tried to divert my caravan from the path we had agreed on . He hoped that if he could lead me to a point where we could obtain a view of the sacred peaks without the trouble of patiently walking around them , I would give up all idea of making the regular pilgrimage , and thus enable him to return as quickly as possible to safer ground . But when he informed me that the caravan had gone north instead of west , I ordered him to overtake it at once and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the snout of Chanadordje Glacier . So , late in the eveWing , my Wien and supplies finally arrived at Shingara , after having twice crossed 17,000-foot passes . Shingara. as well as the eastern face of Chanadordje is still nominally in Muli territory ; but no one hailing from 2duli would dare pasture yaks o n its alpine meadows because of the Konkaling outlaws . The following clay we explored the head of the Shingara Valley and its glaciers , while the caravan patiently made its way up the steep , forested slopes to the southwest of Chanadordje . It halted for lunch in Saivo Katso , a valley which , though 15,200 feet above the sea , stands at the foot of two pyramidal peaks named after the Tibetan God of Wealth , Dzambala . Up Shingara , where we shot some snow pigeons , we found two Konkaling Tibetans hiding among the trees . After they had been observed , they stepped forth and called ; whereupon several women crawled from behind huge bowlders in the stream bed . Any shots heard hereabouts are always supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , since no one wastes shot and powder on useless pigeons , as we had done . AN ARDUOUS TRIP FOR THE MULES Our journey around the peaks proved very arduous . We crossed the Yaka Pass under torrential downpours . There was no  | trail , and the ground was littered with slabs of schists over which the water rushed in torrents , depositing everywhere a slippery gray mud , which meant torture for the loaded mules at an altitude of 16.300 feet . In the eyes of pilgrims , we most certainly should have acquired much merit , for the weather god could hardly have sent worse weather ? or better ? as the case may be , depending on the religious viewpoint . That night we spent on the southeastern slopes of Mount Jambeyang , highest of the Konkaling peaks , rising to an elevation of more than 20,000 feet . Shenrezig and Chanadordje are each about 20,000 feet in height ( see Color Plate XVII ) . On Yaka Pass wonderful primroses formed large round cushions , their roots embedded in cracks between bowlders , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by brilliant wine-colored flowers . Other cushion plants vied with these , such as forget-me-nots of the richest sky-blue . Other primroses stood in rows upon rock shelves , their purple flowers nodding in the wind and rain . The mules , climbing over the rocky pass , which resembled a stairway with giant steps , fared badly and had to be helped bodily over the bowlders . Climbing at such altitudes is difficult enough in good weather , but in a terrific hail and rain storm , with a howling gale driving the icy pellets into one 's face and making one gasp for breath in this rarefied atmosphere , it is doubly disagreeable . A stream , its accumulated waters rushing from the rocks around us , gushed madly over the trail , past a peak with a truncated apex resembling a cenotaph . This was Tuparu , symbolizing another mountain deity .  | That night we camped on the southern slopes of Mount Jambeyang , at the foot of moraines and hanging glaciers , in an alpine meadow covered with a multitude of flowers . Giant rhubarbs grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lama guide occupied a cavelike shelter under an overhanging cliff , part of the buttresses of mighty Jambeyang . Here pilgrims or lamas had erected chortens , or reliquary shrines , which rose to the rocky vault ; a rock balustrade encircled the long cavern which serves pilgrims as well as bandits for shelter and place of attack ( see p. 60 ) . The stillness of the cold night at the high elevation of our camp was often disturbed by the thundering noise of falling blocks of ice , dropping and sliding from the heights above . AN INTERVIEW WITH THE BANDIT CHIEF Near this shelter , on our second trip around the peaks ( see text , page 64 ) , we encountered Drashetsongpen , the bandit chief . He was circumamhulating the sacred peaks , perhaps in expiation of his heinous crimes or in , contemplation of new predatory ventures . His entourage was composed of the scum of outlaws , their sullen faces hinting at loot and murder . The leader politely uncovered his head , bowed , and motioned for me to sit on a rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yak hide , from the recesses of which he took large chunks of much-fingered yak butter and loaves of a sort of cottage cheese . It rained in torrents while this took place , which prevented me from taking pictures of him and his thirty outlaws , all armed with rifles and pistols looted from Chinese soldiers in the north . He asked me where we intended to camp that night . As I hesitated to reply . he placed his hand upon his chest and said : " You will have nothing to fear , for I have given orders that you shall remain unmolested . " This ended our interview . Soon we ran into a wapiti at the foot of terrific cliffs . My hunter aimed and fired , the bullet finding its mark ; but the animal rolled probably 2,000 feet , down to the bottom of Lawatong Valley . Our trail now led to another pass , 16,500 feet in height , and up a most peculiar valley , Yetchetsura , on the slopes of Mount Jambeyang ( see map , page 7 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of enormous slabs as smooth as a billiard table , the entire valley slope resembling a huge macadam road . Giant blocks the size of a small house , cornposed of many layers of such slabs , had fallen from the heights and lined the trail , which was still covered in places with large patches of snow and ice . A rainstorm made traveling very disagreeable , and as the clay was waning we were chilled to the bone . THE MOST DANGEROUS PART OF THE JOURNEY We camped that night at 16,200-feet elevation , in Tonvi Besi territory , where dwell the worst of all the Konkaling outlaws . In this region are several lakes . The largest , Russu Tso , is at 15.500-feet elevation . The glaciers of Jambeyang feed the lake from vast hanging fields of ice . ' l'his is considered the most dangerous part of the journey around the sacred peaks . Our lama guide , who carried one of my rifles , looked anxiously about , then tremblingly handed the gun to my headman . High on the slopes , under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind rocky parapets . They commanded the entire lake valley and could have kept us from moving forward . Whether they were bandits or pilgrims we never learned . They remained behind their rocky ramparts and watched as we laboriously climbed to another pass , a level alpine meadow with valleys radiating in various directions . A long valley , Konka Den , descends east from here , between Jambeyang and Shenrezig , and on another journey we explored and camped in it . That night we were to reach a tiny monastery called Tsengu Gomba , at the foot of Mount Shenrezig , facing the glaciers and a lovely stream hemmed in by larches , firs . and spruces . To reach it , another terrible pass of r6.2oo feet had to be scaled , the trail leading in sharp zigzags to a rocky crest and thence steeply down Bonquende Valley . To our left , in a terrific gorge far below , flowed the Ren Chu . It encircles the Konkaling plateau and flows in a northeasterly direction into the Shou Chu River . We had expected to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were disappointed . On we went in torrential rains ,  | soaked to the skin , our hands numb and our shoes full of water , until we struck juniper forests and the roaring glacier stream of Shenrezig , whose eternally snow-crowned peak was hidden in mist and clouds . We reached a larch forest . The trees were heavy-stemmed and thick-set. but not tall . At the foot of the rocky valley wall opposite nestled a deep-blue lake , Dutsu Kwa , or Shenrezig 's Cup . After an arduous , cold , wet march , we reached Tsengu Gomba , a small and dilapidated monastery situated at the comparatively low altitude of 14.120 feet , on a spur near the junction of Bonquende and Shindze rivers . We were ushered into one of the stone buildings , black and dingy , word having been sent by Drashetsongpen to take us in and extend such hospitality as the place afforded . The caravan unloaded in the tiny courtyard in pouring rain , while we entered the old building through a ( lark , narrow corridor . On both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibetans were cooking over damp wood fires . TAKING SHELTER IN BANDIT MONASTERY I was led over a steep stairway to the left , into a fairly good room ? for that part of the world . It ryas the best the monastery could afford and ryas evidently the quarters of a living Buddha . The ceiling and walls were painted , and at the head of the room was a throne and bed , above which hung some Tibetan scrolls representing Tsongkapa , the founder of the Yellow sect ( see , also , Color Plate XX ) . To my left a door led into a tiny private chapel , wherein reposed the tutelary demon of the Buddha . From below jumper incense seeped through my glassless and paperless window and through every crack and crevice in the floor . Since no white man had ever visited this weird spot , or any foreigner ever circumambulated these sacred peaks , a crowd of Tibetan bandit pilgrims , queer-looking men and women , had come to watch our arrival . They had climbed over the wall and stared at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange spectacle ? the arrival of the first white man the roof of this monastery ever sheltered . Their curiosity satisfied , they continued their pilgrimage , continually walking around the old monastery from right to left , chanting in unison . I felt buried in these mountain fastnesses , icebound on all sides . The monastery was the rendezvous of all the outlaws and bandits and perhaps some occasional genuine pilgrim of the surrounding noman's-land . My lama guide tried to persuade me not to stay longer than a clay and wanted to move on the next morning , but I demurred . Had I not come to photograph and map the sacred peaks , to collect the flora and fauna of this unknown region ? SHENREZIG RESEMBLES A HUGE WHITE THRONE I stayed three days . The morning after our arrival the sun shone gloriously and I managed to obtain some fine photographs of Shenrezig . The peak resembles a huge white throne , such as Living Buddhas use when meditating ? a worthy seat for a Tibetan deity ! A magnificent view could be had of the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding a spot whence peak , glacier , and stream could he photographed to advantage , I left the monastery alone . I had not been gone long when my bandit escort became aware of my absence and rushed forth to find me . They ran to me , when they saw me all alone up the valley in the stream bed , and surrounded me , all armed with loaded rifles . They warned me never to go out alone again , for it was taking one 's life into one 's hands . I laughed and followed them back to the shelter of the old monastery roof . Great forests cover the spur and valley in which Tsengu Gomba is situated ; but I noticed a spot not far from the monastery where the trees had been felled . Being astonished at such vandalism perpetrated near a shrine , I inquired who was responsible for this destruction . The lamas told me that the year before avalanches had descended from Shenrezig and overwhelmed the trees . They added that whenever this happens invariably the lamasery is looted by bandit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monastery , but said it must be well over a hundred years old , for this was the third generation of their Living Buddha . With my lama guide I visited the monastery . armed with silver half dollars , which I distributed as gifts among the monks . The main building contained four temple rooms , one housing an obscene , many- armed image . Outside , tied to posts , were all kinds of offerings , left there by perambulating pilgrims ? bracelets , rings , beads , feathers , bells ? even hairs . There was nothing beautiful whatever , only filth and evil smells . The few praying lamas were dressed in rags shiny from yak butter , for their robes serve as towels as well as handkerchiefs . A CONSTANT STREAM Or BANDIT PILGRIMS Next to my quarters stood a small square building containing a large prayer wheel and a fresco portraying the trinity , Risumgongba . An ever-moving stream of evil - looking pilgrims entered the little house , gave the prayer cylinder a complete turn , and then moved on , continuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tsengu Gomba is a combination of monastery a n d nunnery , for here are housed both monks and nuns , even in the same room . The nuns were lean and lanky old creatures , six feet or even taller , and wore high Tibetan hoots . Their mouths were toothless , their heads shaven , and trousers covered their limbs . Only when they spoke was it possible to distinguish them from men . My nights here were most disagreeable . The smoke from the open fires in the center of the rooms below found its way into my quarters and made my eyes smart my nose and throat were irritated by ammonialike odors from the surrounding stables , which are never cleaned . I decided to leave sooner than I had expected , much to the delight of my lama guide , who felt the responsibility of his charge most heavily . PEERLESS JAMBEYANG We left on the final lap for a pass up Shindze Valley . There we camped at 15 , - 800 feet , where we could view both Jambeyang and Shenrezig to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights at this high camp , called Bayu . The second morning , with a temperature of 400 Fahrenheit. on June 26 , my lama awakened me at 4 : 30 a. m. , calling into my tent , " Behold the glory of Jambeyang and Shenrezig ? your luck indeed is great ! "  | I rose and stepped into the cold , gray morn . In a cloudless sky before me rose the peerless pyramid of Jambeyang , the finest mountain my eyes ever beheld . The sky was greenish black . The snowy pyramid was gray , but the apexes of both it and Shenrezig suddenly turned a golden yellow , as the sun 's rays kissed them . Long after Shenrezig was hidden in clouds , the glory of Jambeyang remained in full view and brought back to mind my last glimpse of the sacred peaks of the Amnyi Machen from Shachu Yimkar . On my second journey around the Konkaling peaks , in August , we experienced even worse weather . The summer monsoon had descended in full force and made traveling still more difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o u n t Chanadordje , for it persistently refused to unveil its hoary head . Later in 1928 I had intended again to visit the Konkaling peaks and once more tried to engage the Mali king 's help . This time he was a bit uneasy . Rumor had it in Kulu Monastery that Drashetsongpen had sent a letter regarding us . The king at the time stoutly denied having received such a letter and gave me permission to go to the Konkaling plateau . MOUNTAIN GODS ANGRY All arrangements for my third visit had apparently been made by him . 1-Ie had detailed a lama to accompany us . I started , going from Kulu to Djago , where the king 's sis ter and her husband lived ( see Color Plate XVI ) . But early the next morning a runner arrived with a letter from the king inclosing one received by him from Drashetsongpen . My royal friend begged me to desist , for the robber chief said he had heard of our presence in Muli , and should we again visit his territory he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murder us . His reason was the obvious displeasure of the gods . Shortly after our last trip around the peaks the wrath of the deities was aroused and hailstones descended in such size and quantity as to destroy the entire barley crop of the Tonyi Besi outlaws . Knowing their cruelty and determination , we took the hint , and thus the land of the Konkaling outlaws is again closed and their mountains remain guarded as of yore.  |
