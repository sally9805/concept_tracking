All that was needed to make War II the legitimate heir to War I was a knitting bee , and busily clacking their needles this week were more than 5,000,000 British women , more than one-ninth of the whole population of the Kingdom . Yet with the demand for yarn ten times greater than in peacetime , the price last week was successfully held to eightpence ( 14 ) per ounce , up just a penny from the pre-war level . <P> For once it was not emphasized that many prominent British males , including most of the King 's brothers , are expert fancy knitters , samples of whose work are exhibited in Britain occasionally in peacetime . The London Daily Telegraph &; Morning Post , close to Downing Street , emphasized rather the feminine side : <P> " Now , after little more than six weeks , the knitter is conspicuous everywhere . Philosophers , mostly men , agree that for large projects and noble ideals man is supreme . Nothing could prove more strikingly than knitting woman 's devotion to the small things . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between stops in a train or omnibus , purling two or casting off between glimpses of Mr. Cooper and Miss Colbert on the screen-this is an object lesson in concentration and in kindly devotion . " <P> Knitting became the acceptable conversational topic at Mayfair dinner tables , even male ARPers knitting to pass the time . Female knitters are called Sister Susies after the popular World War I song : Sister Susie 's sewing shirts for soldiers , Such skill at sewing shirts our shy young sister Susie shows , Some soldiers send epistles , Say they 'd sooner sleep in thistles , Than the saucy soft short shirts for soldiers sister Susie sews . <P> Singled out as " The Commander in Chief of Knitting " was retired Vice Admiral Hubert Seeds ( " The Dear " ) Monroe , 62 , newly appointed chairman of the Royal Navy War Comforts Committee . For the wartime saucy soft short shirts of British sailors , posited the Admiralty in a broadside to knitters last week , it is necessary to employ two-ply and even three-ply yarn .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
