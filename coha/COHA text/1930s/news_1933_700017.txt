The army in Havana and in the interior tightened control today to prevent further looting of homes and businesses belonging to Machado adherents . The first frenzy of the people had spent itself during the past two days , however , so that little rioting occurred in the city today . But the hunt for members of La Porra , the Machado murder squad , went on and four more were killed .

Dr. de Cespedes advised Secretary of Justice Saladrigas that he was to fill the office of Secretary of State ad interim . This correspondent and another foreign correspondent were the only press representatives to witness the ceremonies of signing the decrees and administering the oaths . The salons were immediately cleared of the few persons who had attended the ceremonies and the first Cabinet meeting of the new regime began .

The new Cabinet greatly strengthens the de Cespedes ernment and assures the cooperation of all political factions . The I ABC student revolutionary group , until recently a secret organization and now one of the most powerful political factors on the island , obtained two portfolios . The Cabinet is as follows : Secretary of Justice ? Dr. Carlos Saladrigan , an ABC leader . Secretary of the Treasury  --  Joaquin Martinez Saenz , also an ABC leader . Secretary of Communications  --  Nicasio Silveri ? of the 0 . C. R. R .. , a revolutionary society . Secretary of the Interior  --  Federico Laredo Bru of the liationalista party .

Following the installation of the Cabinet , President de Cespedes addressed a large gathering in the ' immense receiving salon of the palace . The assemblage represented all walks of life in the nation . - The union of all Cuba is the fervent desire of those working toward the salvation of the nation , " the President said . " The intelligence of the majority of the political , social , intellectual , labor and economic elements of the republic makes this possible . " A glorious chapter in the history of Cuba has begun . Inspired by the story of our heroic and persistent effort to acquire independence and our material progress since the founding of the republic , we shall put aside the bitter passions of conflict and work toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nation in order to leave no doubt of our capacity for self-government in the future . " Refers to His Father . Speaking of his choice for the Presidency , Dr. de Cespedes said : " I have been selected by reason of the remembrance of my illustrious father probably as much as for any other reason , and in view of such confidence I shall not fail to measure up to the name that means so much to Cuban independence . " I have accepted without hesitation this high honor conferred upon me and I count upon the cooperation of all factions in the work of re-establishing peace and prosperity throughout the republic . " The enthusiasm displayed by the public today when the Cabinet appointments were announced dissipated the fears raised yesterday over the uncertain future of the nation . The fact that a majority of the Cabinet members are young men deeply interested in the welfare of the republic raised the hopes of observers . The new government is facing many problems that must be handled quickly and efficiently . The treasury is empty . Public employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the army and the navy . Money for current expenses is lacking because of the failure of the Machado government to collect taxes from a bankrupt and passively resisting people . The foreign debt , which Cuba in her present impoverished condition finds impossible to carry , must receive prompt attention . A high financial source unconnected with the government has given the impression that in the view of the new administration , which will undoubtedly be advised and assisted by Ambassador Welles , it is highly possible that a moratorium on foreign obligations will not be difficult to obtain . The most pressing problem now is Congress , which will soon be urgently called upon to take up not only economic matters , especially taxation , but constitutional reforms as well . Because of the hurried departure of many members of Congress from the island and the animosity of the people against these men , mostly ardent supporters of the Machado regime , the question arises whether it will be possible to muster a quorum in either house . Major Alberto Barreras , President of the Senate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , departed aboard the United Fruit steamer Quirigua , which sailed this morning for Central America . Many other members of Congress can not be located and Manuel Castellanos , Conservative representative of Havana Province , said today that when the first session was called by the new President hej would ask that Congress be dissolved . The de Cespedes government , however , desires to follow constitutional procedure and information from the Palace indicates that the dissolving of Congress will come only as a last resort . General Alberto Herrera , formerly Secretary of War who resigned in favor of Dr. de Cespedes , departed with his wife and sons this morning aboard the Quirigua . " While students unsuccessfully searched for the former chief of staff of the army he was safely hidden in the National Hotel guarded by soldiers and was able to reach the docks without mishap . General Machado 's country estate Nenita was ransacked by a mob late yesterday afternoon , it was learned today . The caretaker and other employes of the famous plantation , who resisted attack , were killed and livestock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The estate Dona Juana , also the property of the deposed President , was sacked and the buildings were destroyed . High officials of the Machado regime are being hunted by the student element which has sworn to kill them . They are particularly seeking Octavio Zubizaretta , former Secretary of the Interior , who is accused of having issued orders to torture many political prisoners and to kill many others . Captain Crespo , who commanded the Presidential guard and was chief of Atares Fortress , where the old dungeons were used as torture chambers , is reported to have been killed by soldiers , but this can not be officially confirmed . It was learned this afternoon from a reliable source that the two secret service operatives named Balmaseda and Paleaz , who had been imprisoned in Cabanas Fortress yesterday , committed suicide this morning . Reports from the interior today indicated almost complete tranquillity , with indications that workers were returning to their jobs and that the commerce and transportation of the island might soon be normal again .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
