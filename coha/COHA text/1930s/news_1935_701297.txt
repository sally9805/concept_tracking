txt Platforms and Performances . Frederic J. Swift in his letter to THE Times reverts to the proposal for a single-term Presidency but neglects to cite his most pertinent supporting material which is the declaration embodied in the 1912 Democratic national platform : " We favor a single Presidential term , and to that end urge the adoption of an amendment to the Constitution making the President of the United States ineligible for re-election and we pledge the candidate of this convention to this principle .
