Science has been taking slow , groping steps toward a common explanation for all physical phenomena . James Clerk Maxwell ( 1831-79 ) , father of the trend , stated that electricity and magnetism were nearly the same thing . Step by step interrelations have been discovered between electricity , magnetism , light , gravity . The general tendency is to reduce the universe to one of wave phenomena . <P> Little over a year ago Albert Einstein announced his field theory , asserting a definite relationship between electricity and gravity ; asserting that they are interrelated to the extent that they are expressible by common equations . To the world he gave out the root formulae of his invention , called field equations ( TIME , Feb. 18 , 1929 ) . <P> Great was the reception granted this announcement . Few , however , were those who understood it , ever dreamed of understanding it . After the glamorous reception , flaws began to appear in Dr. Einstein 's mother equations , their accuracy was challenged . Once again grizzled Einstein retired to his iron-doored garret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Mayer , on the revision and proof of his formulae . <P> Last week he came out , announced to the world in general and the Prussian Academy of Sciences in particular that he had revised his original work , had gone one step further , had solved his field equations for a definite set of physical facts . <P> In the development of a natural law two steps are necessary : 1 ) Statement of the law ; 2 ) Application of the law to specific problems . Thus , almost anyone can make a statement so long as it does not contradict accepted laws . The difficulty is encountered in proving it . <P> Last week 's despatches from Berlin indicated that Herr Einstein had satisfactorily surmounted the difficulty ; solved his field equations for two specific cases , proved his assumption . In the first case he selected an imaginary charged sphere to apply his formulae to , in the second a number of isolated charged points in space . Both conditions are actually represented in the universe . From the first the relationship between gravity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electro-gravitational relation of Earth to the universe . <P> In applying Case 1 to Earth it is necessary to alter the globe to some extent . We must imagine it a perfect sphere , devoid of any flattening at the poles , devoid of hills , dales . On such a sphere the gravitational pull at any two points equidistant from the surface is equal . If we further assume that this sphere is a charged body the electrical forces will everywhere be symmetrical . These conditions exist approximately on Earth . To such a sphere and to the two pairs of forces acting on it the parent field equations of Einstein were applied , found to bear out his predicted relationship between electricity and gravity . <P> The second solution of the formulae is in the nature of a confirmation of the first .
