In day coaches on a train from New York City to Albany last week rode five despairing , middle-aged women put aboard by a noisy , demonstrative crowd of friends . In a parlor car on the same train , rode New York 's bald , kindly Governor Herbert Lehman , glad to be unnoticed . At his office in Albany , some hours later , he met them face to face . For five hours Mesdames Fanny Zimmerman , Yetta Friedman , Ellen O'Loughlin , Yetta Chaleff , Mary Guariglia sat before him silent and tearless ( by advice of counsel ) . For five hours he had to face them while lawyers-talking of poverty , slum life , marijuana , liquor-urged him to commute the sentences of the five women 's five sons , aged 19 to 27 , who were doomed to die January 26 for committing murder in the holdup of a Manhattan gambling house. * When Governor Lehman had heard all , he solemnly shook the mothers ' hands , took a last look into their five anxious faces ( see cut ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal had its effect . That very day Assemblyman Edgar F. Moran introduced in the Legislature an amendment to New York 's Constitution to let the Governor share his most harrowing responsibility , by setting up a Board of Pardons . Today 16 States have Pardon Boards . But in most States , Governors , though they may rely on other officials to make factual investigations and recommendations , must exercise the awful power of pardoning and commuting sentences alone . <P> <P> * One of the condemned , diabetic Philip Chaleff , was with difficulty being kept alive for the chair by injections of insulin.
