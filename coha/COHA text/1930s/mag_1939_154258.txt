Air mail , like grand opera , is something nobody expects to make a profit . But last week , with all the figures added up for the fiscal year ending last June 30 , U. S. air mail revenue was reckoned at $15,301,210 ; contract pay to airlines at $14,564,256 . Result : a $736,954 profit , first in U. S. air mail history . <P> Just when the Post Office was congratulating itself on having thus got some of its air mail subsidy bait back , news came from London that in June Imperial Airways expects to start flying mail over the Atlantic to Canada for 12 a half-ounce . This would be less than half the rate the U. S. had figured on if and when some U. S. airline decides to start flying the Atlantic . Only way to meet such a British rate would be to pay carriers the difference in outright subsidy , such as Imperial now enjoys .
