The N. W. Burchell Grocery , Washington , D. C. , was founded in 1856 . Mrs. Lincoln bought groceries there , and the store has been sending orders ' round to the White House ever since . The present proprietress is Mrs. Norvall Burchell , widow of the founder 's son . She is proud of the store 's historical role , rather sensitive , however , about current profits &; losses . For Burchell 's closes this week-due , Mrs. Burchell says , to chain store competition , not loss of Presidential patronage .
