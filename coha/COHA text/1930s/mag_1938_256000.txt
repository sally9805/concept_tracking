U. S. Conductors <P> No U. S.-born conductor has ever been conceded a place at the top of his profession ; and few have ever rated a job as chief of even a second-rate U. S. symphony orchestra . A rare exception is the Kansas City Philharmonic 's Karl Krueger , who last week completed a tour of Italy as guest maestro with the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra . Fuzzy-headed , cigar-puffing Krueger , who during the past four years has put Kansas City , Mo. , on the symphonic map , was born in Atchison , Kans . <P> Principal reasons for the dearth of famous U. S.-born maestros have been : 1 ) a lack of places where the young U. S. conductor can cut his teeth ; 2 ) snobbishness . In Germany , where conducting is as specialized a profession as brain surgery , conductors are systematically trained and systematically advanced in their careers . The neophyte , having mastered several musical instruments and taken a complete course in musical composition , enters a conductors ' class at the konservatorium , where he studies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick at an orchestra . Then he graduates . But that is only the beginning . Assigned to the staff of an opera house , he spends years rehearsing choruses , teaching singers how to sing their parts , helping conductors whip scenes into shape . Eventually , if he shows talent , he is allowed to conduct an opera or two . Only after a long term as a full-fledged opera conductor does he attempt the exacting business of conducting a symphony orchestra . Conducting opera is like driving a 20-mule team , gives an ideal training for conductors . A Brahms symphony holds no technical terrors for a man who is able to keep a badly-rehearsed chorus , five or six erratic singers and an orchestra in the same place at the same time . <P> The U. S. has no small , provincial opera houses . Assistant conductorships in the few permanent U. S. opera companies are very seldom awarded to U. S.-born aspirants , full-fledged conductorships almost never . U. S. audiences , long accustomed to judging other types of musicians impartially on their merits , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear a fairly well-equipped and conscientious native maestro . Boards of directors of U. S. symphony orchestras , sometimes influenced by socialite patronesses , usually demand colorful or famous personalities . Current in orchestral circles is the remark of a well-known pianist 's wife : * " When a conductor in Europe has a love affair , the result usually is a child ; in America an entire orchestra . " <P> To compete with full-fledged &; experienced European rivals , many U. S. conductors have not only studied in Europe but have launched their careers there . European opera houses will occasionally take on a U. S. student for odd jobs . Second-rate European orchestras can usually be hired for concerts . But hiring a loo-man orchestra to practice on is a luxury that only a very liberally financed maestro can afford .
