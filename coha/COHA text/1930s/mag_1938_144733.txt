In southern England 3,000 years ago , voracious packs of wolves roamed the moist lowlands . The savage Britons of that Stone Age period , who had learned the art of domesticating animals , had to keep their cattle on the uplands lest they be devoured . On the uplands there were few streams of water . With the eerie ingenuity which savages sometimes manifest , the herders built " dew ponds " which stayed full of water though the animals drank from them every day . Some modern authorities contend that rain contributes practically all of the ponds ' water supply , but others disagree , claiming that dew-moisture condensed from the air- provides the important portion . <P> The latter view is taken by the editors of Arthur D. Little , Inc. ' s Industrial Bulletin ( chemical news and scientific miscellany ) , who discussed the British dew ponds in last week 's issue and gave an explanation of the heat economy which makes them possible . " Recent research , " said the Bulletin , " has shown that water is nearly perfect as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives off heat by radiation . " The pond must keep cool so that dew will condense in it , and so that it will not lose much water by evaporation . If it is insulated , it will not absorb much heat from the earth . The heat it absorbs from the air and the sun can be lost by radiation . In principle , it is something like a thermos bottle for cold drinks . <P> After digging out the basin for a pond , the Stone Age people lined it with straw , then covered the straw with a layer of clay . This furnished the necessary insulation . Some present-day English builders are reputedly able to make successful dew ponds , but they generally use concrete instead of straw and clay . Moreover , after construction , these modern ponds have to be filled with water first in order to keep going . Whether the ponds of the ancients filled up by natural accumulation of water , starting from a dry basin , no one knows .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
