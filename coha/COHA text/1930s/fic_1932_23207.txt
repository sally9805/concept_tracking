AN ELEGY FOR ALMA 'S AUNT AMY A STORY BY RUTH SUCKOW W ALNUT GROVE was the place where I did my first and only teaching . Ever since then a miniature of the town has stayed fixed in my mind , sober and primitive in line , touched with sunset color  --  it is always winter , and the frame houses are standing straight and plain , the steeple of the Congregational church is pointing , and the teachers are going down the long straight sidewalk toward a cold red sky that lies behind the upraised branches of the bare black trees . After my year of teaching , I had gone to Chicago and then to other places . That short time in Walnut Grove seemed very distant . But one summer when I was at home I went with my mother on a visit to Pleasant City . Almost the first person I saw when we entered the bus was Marian Burke , who used to teach in high school with me . We two hailed each other with as much surprise as if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ! Are you going to stop off at Walnut Grove ? " I had forgotten that Walnut Grove was on the way to Pleasant City . I had almost forgotten that it really existed outside my miniature . Mother let Marian and me sit together , and we told each other the news about ourselves ; and then Marian told me what had become of the other teachers , what our old pupils were do-ing , who had married whom . But she lived at Creston , only a few stations beyond my home , and she had to leave the bus before I had asked her half the questions I wanted to ask . But I did remember and called out the window to her : " Oh ! What about Alma ? " Alma Root and I still conscientiously exchanged Christmas cards , but it was a good while since we had written to each other . Marian said , " I do n't know about Alma . Same as always , I guess . But I wonder if you 've heard that Miss Ramsey is dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't exactly belong in my miniature of the town with the cold sky and the bare trees . Alma 's house was always something separate . Alma was the one who was supposed to be my friend . But it would not have been the same kind of a loss  --  although in a way more shocking , since Alma was younger  --  if I had heard it was she who was dead . Mother asked me , " Who was this lady ? " " Alma Root 's Aunt Amy , " I said . We drove on down the long paved road . Mother had got to talking with another woman , and so I had a seat to myself , in rocking comfort , and I could think about what I pleased . That house  --  Alma Root 's home  --  was the place where all of us teachers liked to go best . It was a haven for us , a second home . The house seemed quite grand in Walnut Grove . It stood back from the street , on a wide lawn , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its frame tower , trimmed with fancy shingles , had been imposing in its day . No new house had been built in Walnut Grove to surpass it . The town 's days of hopefulness , if it had ever had any , were gone . Mr. Root had been the lawyer . He had left Mrs. Root and Alma fairly well to do . Inside the house there was a substratum of 1890 furniture , but mixed with new colonial mahogany , and very up-to-date trimmings in the way of draperies , cushions , and little do-dads . Alma kept up with such things . There were the kind of everyday American comforts that some of us girls had missed in our rooms at Mrs. Farmer 's and that we reveled in when Alma invited us . Walnut Grove , which did n't have even a railroad except a little station-stop two miles away , and which lay at the side of the highway , was distinctly a rural town . In some of the houses where we were invited for supper they still had their hard-coal burners that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar , with the red-glowing deep bed of coals , but that sent their warmth only half way through the chill of the dining room . I fear it may have been because we liked to go to her house so well that we teachers so assiduously kept up our friendship with Alma . When we talked about her among ourselves we were apt to criticize her . Oh , well , we liked Alma , too . We more or less counted her as one of the crowd  --  so that when we had a spread or took a walk on Sunday afternoon one of us would say with contrition , " We ought to have asked Alma . " She was about thirty or thirty-one the year I was in Walnut Grove , a large , soft-faced , babyish girl with a skin like an infant 's and a small , half-poutedmouth . At home she was treated like a girl by her mother and her Aunt Amy , and we teachers treated her that way too . But in Walnut Grove thirty still meant an old maid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married or scattered , and Alma was left . She was like a strange mixture of too young and too old . It seemed that she had been a delicate child ( the teachers privately scoffed at that , Alma looked so obviously blooming with that soft , baby-skinned face ) and so she had always stayed home with mama and papa . One year in boarding-school had put her forever out of the class of the other girls in Walnut . She held little sporadic jobs  --  taught the primary for a week when Jessie Davis was ill , and took tickets occasionally at this or that . But she still was n't considered , and did n't think of herself , as strong enough to do anything beyond that . And what could Alma do by this timer She had stayed too long under her parent 's warm , sheltering wings ; and now she had both her mother and her Aunt Amy to spend all their care upon her . Mrs. Root was anxiously pleased to have the teachers come to the house , because " it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come no better than we liked to go there ! Poor innocent ladies , they did n't know how , going there for supper , arms linked , we smacked our lips and giggled at our shameful , shameless ravenousness . Mrs. Root and Miss Ramsey were full of anxiety to have everything nice for Alma 's friends . They spent as much care and planning upon those meals as if we had been more distinguished guests than were ever likely to visit Walnut Grove . They were busy in the kitchen when we arrived , but Mrs. Root always stepped into the living room to say , " I 'm so glad you could come , girls , " and to ask us if Alma had taken our wraps and shown us the way to the bathroom . Then she would smilingly excuse herself . Miss Ramsey came in with her , just as kind and welcoming , but quieter , since the house was not hers but her sister 's ; and when Mrs. Root went back to the kitchen , she would go too . Once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there was something we could do to help . But Mrs. Root always sent us straight back to the other room , saying , " No thank you , dear ; Aunt Amy and I can manage everything . You girls just rest and have a good time . " Miss Ramsey smiled in corroboration ; and as we left we would hear her asking " sister " if she was ready to have the potatoes mashed now or wanted her to make the coffee . Once when I tried to insist on helping , because it seemed as if those two ladies had done so much for us , Miss Ramsey , who was setting the table in the dining room , gently squeezed my hand in her little delicate fingers and confided , " Oh , no , my dear , it 's lovely of you , but my sister would rather that Alma just enjoyed herself with her friends . She does n't have anyone else here but you girls . " It was always a great moment for us when Miss Ramsey came into the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then when she had the chance , saying : " Well , girls , you can come into the dining room , now . " Mrs. Root was standing there waiting for us . She showed us to our places . " Now , Marian , I think you sat right there before , so you can just have your old place . Vivian , you can sit next to Aunt Amy again , to keep her out of mischief . " She remembered what kind of jelly we liked best , and always had it on the table , clear amber-rose apple jelly trembling in the shining cut-glass dish . Because we were Alma 's friends , we were all her children ? and Miss Ramsey was our Aunt Amy . We were petted little girls in that house . Lil Patterson , who taught the eighth grade , was a wild kind of raw-boned big creature , loud-mouthed , with a crude sense of humor . But you ought to have seen the way she tamed herself down when she entered that house . It was really sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much except to give us advice about our colds and commiserate with us over our teaching troubles and urge the delicious food upon us . They kept their eyes upon the dishes ; and Miss Ramsey would rise softly , with a gentle air of duty , and carry the platter out to the kitchen to be refilled with chicken . Sometimes they came into the parlor with us later , where we turned on the victrola or played cards ; but often they sat just beyond the large open doorway , in the living room , doing some sewing ( usually for Alma ) and seeming to take pleasure in hearing us talk . Miss Ramsey did come in with us sometimes , but I do n't think Alma exactly liked that . We were her friends , and she wanted her mother and her Aunt Amy to keep out of it  --  just as a child is impatient if the grown-ups try to join in its games . But those meals ! We teachers boarded at the hotel . We had good hearty fare and gained on it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind getting a change from the beefsteak and fried potatoes . Mrs. Root was spoken of with awe as one of the best cooks in Walnut Grove , " and I guess Miss Ramsey is n't far behind her . " When the ladies of the church held a bake sale , people hurried down town as soon as the hardware store was opened , so that they would n't be too late for Mrs. Root 's angel food cake and Miss Ramsey 's chocolate cookies . Whatever they cooked was glorified . The mashed potatoes were like whipped cream , the little biscuits were one melting bit of hot deliciousness into which the butter soaked golden , the jelly had a bouquet like some exquisite wine . That dining room , ordinary enough in its furnishings , seemed heavenly to us after the long table at the hotel , with its faded gravy spots and raspberry-juice stains and thick coffee cups that were enough to break your teeth . I loved the very cups , with their slightly worn rims of gold , the little spoons that had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowls in which the fragrant first sip of coffee lay so amber-bright . A pleasant warmth came from the radiator , and during the evening we would hear the comforting sound of Jim Coburne downstairs tending the furnace . When the swinging kitchen door was opened lovely warm smells came out . " Wo n't you have some more of the chicken , Marian ? I 'm afraid you did n't have a very good piece . Lillian .. . " ( That was n't Lil 's name . She had actually been named Lily ! But she accepted the " Lillian " with gratitude . ) " Let me give you a piece , too . " Gracefully overlooking the fact that Lil already had a large-sized bone-yard on her plate . " Vivian , you must eat all you can , I want your mother to think we 've been good to you in Walnut Grove . Amy , wo n't you see if they all have gravy ? " Once when we were going home after a supper , Lii had been tramping along lost in thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those two women are my idea of ladies , if you want to know it . " I always thought of them in that way , too . They were Middle-western ladies . They were my idea of that , They were workers . Idleness  --  that idea of ladyhood  --  filled them with disdain . They had known some early hardships . Although Mrs. Root was well-to-do , and Mr. Root , according to a description given me by Mrs. Farmer , interspersed with deep sighs ( aimed at Mr. Farmer ) had been " an awful good husband , " her fingers were a little knotted , and her figure was spread , and she had an ample , motherly bosom . Even Miss Ramsey 's tiny , spinster fingers were worn . Mrs. Root was getting elderly , but still there was not much in the town that went on without her . She baked her marvelous angel cakes for the church suppers , and helped make the coffee for the high school banquet ; and people came to her for roses for the graduation exercises and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daunted her . She could " get up a meal in no time . " She would have been ashamed not to be found capable in any purely human emergency . Both Mrs. Root and Miss Ramsey were of the older generation of self-effacing women , like my own mother . Of course they had their clubs and they prided themselves on their papers . But Mrs. Root had sunk her own desires in those of her children , until I doubt if she knew they even existed ; now that only Alma was at home , everything was naturally for Alma ; and Miss Ramsey took this attitude for granted . Youth had all the claims . They did not think of talking much on general topics . When anything was said about people in town , however , when Alma got a little petulant , or Lil too freespoken , Mrs. Root would put in a mild , dignified , compassionate word of apology or explanation . Her heart , opened up to love and sacrifice through her children , could bear to hold only tenderness and understanding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean it , she does n't know how it looks to people " was the worst she would say . There was a certainty about her hands as she sewed , and a promise of sustainment in her ample breast . Miss Ramsey would n't talk about people either . But that was from a delicate sense of fitness . Walnut Grove was not her lady in late middle age , her girlish attractions were not all gone . She was aware of that . But what chance was there for them to be appreciated ? Also , she had , I think , just a very tiny personal income . She was now living at her sister 's home , and she did not like to appear to dress more elaborately than her sister . I liked to picture some wealthy widower , some fine , portly , handsome , dignified man , who could appreciate her little lovely faded princess quality , and would want to rescue her and install her as mistress of his spacious . lonely home . But there were no widowers like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . There was only Bert Grady , the rural mail carrier , who was bereaved for the second time and was trying to shine up to all the teachers . It was a household of ladies . Alma , no matter how spoiled she might be , had that ladylike quality , too . Her hands had a beautiful softness and she wore around her neck a very fragile golden chain , on which hung a locket , an heirloom , a tiny pool of old gold , upon the exquisite white grain of her skin between the swells of the breasts . The three women lived in that house with the frame tower , not like sleeping beauties waiting to he wakened , but in the dim and changeless after-enchantment of stillness when the prince has gone from their lives . Mr. Root was the hero of all three . Alma would never find any man who would he as good to her as her father . A photograph of him , with a kindly , manly , responsible face , hung framed beside the piano . But of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other two stood together . They had their little grievances against a third in the house . They talked together about some of Aunt Amy 's ways , and Alma complained how Aunt Amy always had to bring in California . " If I 've heard once about the way Mrs. Richmond served grapefruit juice , I 've heard a thousand times . Well , my goodness , what does she think ? We ca n't get the fruit here they can in California . Aunt Amy never will finish talking about that movie star she met . Well , they ought to be beautiful . They 've got everything to make them beautiful . Other people could probably be just as beautiful if they spent all their time on it . " Miss Ramsey doubtless had her grievances too . But there was no one to whom she could talk . Her sense of what was right would not let her seek a confidante outside her sister 's household . She did talk to me once , however . Much as I loved and admired Mrs. Root , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew that I was interested in hearing about the " Blue Boy " and the speakers and singers she and Mrs. Richmond had heard . One Saturday afternoon I went to the house when Alma did n't happen to be there . It was one of those dull , wintry , tedious Saturdays , neither one thing nor the other in regard to the weather . The houses showed their dingy , soot-streaked , winter aspect . I had a longing for the steam-heated warmth of Alma 's house . As I turned at the Roots ' corner I saw the somber , dull darkness of their clump of evergreens against the colorless winter sky . I rang the bell . Miss Ramsey came to the door . " Oh , Vivian , my dear ! How nice ! No , Alma and my sister are n't here . But come in , anyway . Do . I believe I was just waiting for you ! " She had been doing a little sewing , she said . " I took the notion to recover an old cushion filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl . We had such nice country around Fairview . Is n't that an old-fashioned Saturday afternoon occupa-Lion ? Well , I 'm knitting a sweater for Alma , like one she saw in Pleasant City , and I have to wait until I can get more yarn . You know they do n't have things here . " Alma and her mother had gone down to the church to help get things ready for the Washington bazaar . " I did n't want to go . Do n't you sometimes just want to do something that suits yourself and nobody else ? " Her frosty-fine hair was mussed , and she wore a little organdie apron with pink roses faded in many washings , worn stiff and sheer . " You look sweet ! " She laughed . " In this ? Oh , my goodness ! " She had had this little apron , she said , since she was a girl . She had dug it out of her chest along with the milkweed cushion . It was made out of an old summer dress she used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , Vivian . Visit me . " The large house , with its high ceilings and its passages and pantries , seemed strangely , warmly empty on this winter afternoon . There was a slight pounding in the radiator . Jim Coburne had just been there to look after the heat . Miss Ramsey and I felt like usurpers , as if we had to lower our voices . Oh , no , I would n't keep her from her work . There was nothing she had wanted more than a visitor . " But why do n't you come upstairs with me ? I do n't believe you 've ever seen my room . Have you , Vivian ? " I knew Alma 's room , the embroidered spread upon which we girls always laid , our wraps when we came to dinner , and the big dresser with the satin pincushion doll , where we stood to powder our noses . But I had never seen Miss Ramsey 's . " Oh , it 's one of those tower rooms ! I always wanted to live in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Juliet or someone . Can you step out on this little balcony ? " Miss Ramsey laughed . She surely could , she answered . But the only Romeo around here was Jim Coburne , who had been fixing the flooring of the balcony . The rounded alcove of the tower was filled with the clear brightness of windows . We heard Jim Coburne working and hammering away somewhere . This room carried out my secret romantic picture of Miss Ramsey as a fading princess . " It 's a nice room , is n't it , Vivian ? My sister insisted on my taking it . She 's been so lovely to me . Of course I have all my things here . " Her fancy work lay scattered over the chest , and down on the floor the milkweed floss lay in a silvery heap on a paper , spotted with the seeds of dark , dry brown . There was a daintiness and precision about any work Miss Ramsey had to do . Her little pair of scissors had a bright gleam . " Now , Vivian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . It 's one I recovered . No , you ca n't help me . You can it and talk to me . We 'll have a good afternoon 's visit and then we 'll go downstairs and see if we ca n't find some refreshments of some kind . We 'll do just exactly as we please . " Here in her own room that slight shadowiness I had always felt about Miss Ramsey was gone . She was a hostess  --  not warm and comforting and ample like Mrs. Root , but gaily hospitable , with a pretty natural sprightliness like that of a girl . There was a special atmosphere in her room . She took delight in making someone she cared for welcome to its delicately personal revelations . What it was exactly , it 's hard to say . Yet I felt that atmosphere all about me , as I sat in the cretonne-covered chair and watched her sewing . We used to have at home an old music book with dark-green covers . There were pictures opposite the songs ; and I remember I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking and looking at those pictures and trying to handle the tied around their necks  --  there was heavy old book , feeling as if the scenes that faded , fragrant atmosphere . Miss were something I knew and did n't Ramsey 's sewing basket was of sweet know , that if I could get back into grass , a little dry . She had brought some old dream I could enter them and some things from her sojourn in Calibe part of them . That was just the fornia , abalone shells of a glittery kind of feeling I had about Miss iridescence , some Indian baskets , and Ramsey 's room . Almost it let me go a framed colored print of " Boy Blue . " back to a time of girlhood I could never She seemed to think , of course , that I have known . But I had dreamed of would be more interested in the it and knew it . The faded flower of California experience . She brought her girlhood was here . It breathed out out a kodak album , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed see herself and Mrs. Richmond  --  a rocker with the fancy hack and from a plump lady quite fashionably dressed satin sachet upon the dresser with small standing beside the Spanish whiteness pink roses painted on blue . I knew it , of the wall of the apartment house as I knew the broad-ribboned hat , and where they had lived . the puffed sleeves , and the flowered " What pretty clothes you 're wearing gown , of the fair-haired girl who for in all these pictures ! " ever was wandering , in the picture , to " Oh , yes , you could get nice things the music of " Oh that we two were there . And then Mrs. Richmond went Maying , " beside her lover across the a good deal , and I went with her . We fair grass beneath those tall , full trees met a movie actress one day !

Well , I did winter light . like it ! But there comes a time , After a while T began to look about Vivian , when you want to get back to and to ask her what this and that was . what is your own , whatever it may be . " Weil , I have n't much , Vivian . You 're a long way from that time yet , All I have is here ! " but some day you may feel it . I loved The furniture was what she had California , but it was n't my place . I saved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay there . Here , I much more modern furniture in my could do quite a bit to help my sister room in California but I did n't bring and Alma . They 've been lonely since any of it with me . Something had to Mr. Root passed on . Alma is the be done with the old place . So I closest I can come to one of my own . I thought now was the time to pick out can have the things from my own home and save the things I really cared for here . It does n't seem right , somehow , and let the rest go . " to have your mother 's and father 's I suppose there was nothing of much old cherished belongings just scattered value . But about everything  --  the ? or even your own . Vivian , you 're reed rocker , the ornaments here and in my home . " there , the two old-fashioned glass She dosed the kodak book . perfume bottles with the blue ribbszins " Let 's see ! Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all we had taken out there . This old box , " she said , bringing it out and unlocking it , " has been set away so long , I scarcely know myself what 's in it . But a winter afternoon is a good time to look at old keepsakes . Now you can see what I looked like when I was a girl . I expect I looked pretty funny ! " But she did n't  --  as she very well knew . Perhaps she wanted me  --  she wanted someone  --  to recognize again the never quite answered claims of her pretty girlhood . " This was our old home in Fairview , Vivian . My brother sold it when I came here to live with my sister , but my friends tell me that people still call it the Ramsey place . You know how that goes . When people have lived a long while somewhere . You would n't believe how many years I spent in that old house ! I stayed there with father after mother died . Well  --  I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked her how many there had been in her family , and she said seven children  --  five of them girls . " All the others married . I 'm the only old maid , Vivian . But you know every large family has to have one ! " She let me look over the glossy old pictures as I pleased . There were a few square ones with prinked edges touched with gilt . In some , Miss Ramsey was a child , and in some , a girl . But after she was older , there were only kodak pictures  --  as if she no longer cared to record the slow fading of her bloom . We teachers had often wondered about the story of Miss Ramsey 's life . The girls thought " she was so sweet , they wondered if she did n't have some story . " But all the story contained in the old family pictures was open to me now . There was no face that seemed to mean more than another . There was no faded , framed photograph hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school graduating class , but no one of the eight boys with their tall stiff collars and their fresh young mouths fitted into the song that was still singing in my mind . I used to wonder about Miss Ramsey 's story , too  --  if ever her life had come to that moment of bloom that all women feel they must have before they can really start living . She had an air of delicate pride in herself . But in the droop of her faded pink lips and the innocence of her eyes there was still some sense of disappointment held and cherished . I saw now that she was virginal . That was the charm that still hung about her . It had faded , but it had never grown bitter or shriveled or tart . As she had said  --  there were five girls in the family , and somehow one of them had been left , just as one very pretty flower on a blossoming bush may fail to be gathered . She was a princess in a tower of innocence , whose door had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the dim pictures , the few mementoes , that Miss Ramsey 's story had been ? only that there was no story . She had other kinds of wisdom . She had delicate , reticent judgment Occasionally she counseled Alma 's friends . But when we spoke of love or marriage , when we made fun of the attentions of Bert Grady , or wondered if Barney Cummings ' wife would ever have the gumption to leave him , Miss Ramsey said nothing . As she put back the pictures and keepsakes in her box , I felt that she was quietly closing up her life . There was a slight , fine humility in her . The most cherished thing of all had passed her while she stood aside . But I think she liked showing me these things . She summoned up her gaiety again . " Come , Vivian , we 've had enough of old things , have n't we ? Now sup-pose we go downstairs and see if we ca n't have a tea-party together . Alma will be sorry she did n't stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her this time . " Alma has entertained you girls ; now it 's going to be my entertainment this afternoon . " She got out some little cakes from under a cloth . " I baked these earlier in the day . Alma always likes to have these little cakes for Sunday night supper . Now we 'll make the tea . Do you like Chinese tea , Vivian ? I have some that Mrs. Richmond sent me . She got it in the Chinese section in Los Angeles . I think it 's so much fun to hunt out those foreign places . " And she said we would use some of her own cups . These purple cups , striped with flower pink , had belonged to her grandmother . " I do own some nice china , Vivian . It 's all here in my sister 's cupboard , except a few things I have packed away . I want Alma to have them . " This tea , eaten in the warm dining room , was as delicious as every meal those two sisters served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us girls , when we dropped in unexpectedly , anything except what she had made herself . She would not over-step certain fine boundaries she had set . " You know it 's very nice , " she confided , " to have company of my own once in a while like this . Someone whom I like to entertain , like Vivian . My sister and Alma do n't care for the Chinese tea . They think it does n't have much taste . Of course I am at home with my sister . I should have been too lonesome , I 'm afraid , in the old place at Fairview . I 'm afraid I have n't the courage for solitude . You know , Alma has always been a care to my sister . I 've always tried to share that with her . Alma is the only one either of us has left . . Well , we ca n't always have things as we choose them , Vivian . " II And now Miss Ramsey was dead . I said to mother , " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do , " she said . " You can stop and see your friends there , then you can join me to-morrow . " But just what friends did I expect to see ? I got off the bus at the edge of town , at the oil station , and walked up Main Street . I had a lost feeling . I wished I had n't tried to go back . Alma and Mrs. Root might easily be away somewhere . And Miss Ramsey was gone . But the house looked lived in . It looked almost the same . A bird fluttered out of the evergreens as I went up the walk . They were rich and dark against the summer blue . Both Mrs. Root and Alma were at home . When I heard that Miss Ramsey had died it had seemed as if , in an instant , all the old life of that household had vanished . Yet I did not find it very different from before . Its enchantment of feminine quietness still held ; but now there were two , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change was so slight . But as we talked to each other I could feel that Alma was just the same ? and yet a change had come subtly over her . The baby pout of her lips had become a middle-aged droop . Her soft fullness had a heavy look . Her eyes were bewildered . Mrs. Root was as kind and welcoming as ever . Yet she was older , too . The spareness of age was beginning to sharpen her motherliness . She and Alma here in this big house were more set apart from the town than they used to be . They would n't hear of my leaving . I must spend the night with Alma . We would have supper here , like old times . Alma accepted me jealously as her friend . She had never liked any other teachers so well as those that were here that year , she said . They had n't had any attractive ones since . " Oh , Alma . You do n't know these girls so well , that 's all . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ate supper in that same dining room , drank the delicious coffee from the gold-rimmed cups . Mrs. Root had remembered to have the apple jelly . It trembled in the cut-glass dish . We had creamy mashed potatoes , and the little biscuits , and chops that Mrs. Root had telephoned Jim Coburne to get at the meat market . Mrs. Root looked after me and refilled the dishes herself , clinging to what youth she could keep for Alma in this meeting with a friend . Yet that subtle dimming of change had come over the household , too . We talked of Aunt Amy . The thing had happened to her that sooner or later happened to so many people . She had gone for an operation and died . Mrs. Root had asked sadly , " You heard of sister 's death ? " She told me later , when we sat for a little while together , that she could n't get used to it . She had never thought Amy would go first . " Yet perhaps it 's because I 'm needed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves alive . " But in spite of this , it was not what it would have been if either Alma or her mother were gone . These two were so close together , they could only miss the third in a shadowy way . I think that was the very thing that hurt me most . Somewhere , by someone , Miss Ramsey should have been deeply missed . Mrs. Root gave us some of her wild-grape juice , and her cookies ? " I ca n't make cookies as well as Aunt Amy did , " she said  --  and then told us we must go to bed . She was anxious to make sure we had towels and bedding , and she had laid out for me Alma 's best silk nightdress . She left us saying : " Now , do n't you two girls talk all night ! " We slept in the bed where the teachers used to put their winter wraps , and in the morning we dressed before that same glass that mirrored new trinkets and a new little silk-gowned doll . Alma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Root suggested that we start early , and drive about town a bit . " Let Vivian sec the changes . " Alma pouted her lips at that . She asked Alma if she would remember to stop first at the cemetery with a bouquet . " My gladiolas are just at their best now . In a few days they wo n't be so pretty . " Going to the cemetery with flowers was a rite in Walnut Grove that I remembered . I had gone there once or twice with Mrs. Farmer " to see how the lot looked . " The Root lot was far more imposing . It had a tall stone . The cemetery was sunny and quiet at this hour of the day . The sky was blue above it and above the low hills beyond . Alma and I went along the black cinder path . Now I asked Alma about Miss Ramsey . " Oh ! " she said . " Aunt Amy is n't buried here . " And she explained , " No , this is just the Root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . Aunt Amy was taken there . Oh , no , this is just ours . " I had always noticed  --  all the girls had noticed , and it was one of our reasons for criticism  --  how Alma had always sounded a little unpleasant when she talked about her Aunt Amy . That tinge of petulance had come into her voice even now . She had always felt that bit of spite toward her mother 's younger sister . Her two uncles , also , took pains to look after Miss Ramsey . There was a touch of fond protection toward her sister in Mrs. Root 's manner  --  or would have been , except that it was checked by the knowledge that Alma could n't bear it . When Alma was a child , Miss Ramsey must still have been a young woman ; and even when she was older and lived there with them her claims to feminine admiration were not all gone . Alma did n't like any suggestion that her Aunt Amy was not thoroughly relegated and old . The girls had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely marveled and said , " I do n't see how anyone so sweet could have helped getting snapped up by some man . " Alma had said , with that touch of spitefulness , " Oh , I do n't think Aunt Amy ever had any attention . " Mrs. Root had exclaimed at once with indignation , " Why Alma Root , you know nothing about it . Aunt Amy had plenty of attention . I can remember very well when she was the prettiest girl in Fairview . " Alma said , " I always thought it was Aunt Vino , who was supposed to be so handsome ! " Mrs. Root said , " She was more striking , but I always thought Aunt Amy was the prettiest . " Alma said , shrugging her shoulders , " Well , why did n't she get snapped up then ? " Perhaps it was better to think of Miss Ramsey lying in the family lot in Fairview . Yes , it was . She was beside her own parents . From them , she must have had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , and four other girls . . . and it did n't always happen that the parents cared most for the one who stayed with them . Often the least . They felt greater instinctive respect for the children who had built homes of their own . I dropped the flower I had been carrying , one of those from the bouquet of summer flowers Mrs. Root had picked for me . I had wanted , all by myself , to lay it down on Miss Ramsey 's grave . Since that afternoon I had spent with her it seemed as if Iwere closer to her in a way than even Mrs. Root . Someone should have gone specially with an offering of flowers . Now at Decoration Day her grave would get only the flowers left over from the graves of Father and Mother Ramsey . I stood and waited for Alma , while she carefully arranged her bouquets in the tall glass vases on Mr. Root 's well-kept grave . The quietness of the country sunshine spread over the low hills . What was there to say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived well , in the common meaning of that phrase . She had always been well cared for . Many , many minor pleasures , at least , had come her way . She had known less actual sorrow than Mrs. Root . I can see that Alma 's history may be more bitter . This world held so many more terrible things . War and hunger , a world where innocent men could be convicted for crimes they never committed , where thousands of people knew the actual grinding bitterness of poverty , where fortunate men could hold and keep the whip hand over the less fortunate in shameless , unshakeable selfishness . What was there to say ? There seemed no way to assert a claim for this lady . She had suffered what countless women had suffered . It was only that she had missed what should have been hers . It had just fallen out that way . If she had been born a few years later she might not have submitted . But she had been born into her own day and generation . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in people 's memory . Her life was an air that sounded muted and interwoven with others , with no one ever to play and to make audible its separate music . But from someone she may have this much tribute .
