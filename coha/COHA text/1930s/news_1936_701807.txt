txt President Roosevelt 's tax program took its first real legislative step today when the Ways and Means Committee adopted , without change , the recommendations of its subcommittee on taxation on methods of carrying the new revenue ideas into effect . Democratic leaders , including Representative Doughton , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , and Chairman Hill of the subcommittee , insisted that it was only a " trial " step , however , and that the recommendations were approved only as a basis for public hearings scheduled to begin Monday . The subcommittee 's report contained a general endorsement of the President 's proposal for levying corporation taxes on the basis of undistributed profits . It also recommended enactment of his proposed " windfall " levy to recapture at least part of the impounded and unpaid processing tax collections which were returned or abated to processors by Supreme Court orders following invalidation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act . The report made no mention , however , of the President 's suggestion to revive the old form of processing levies for a period of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue necessitated by the outlawing of the AAA and the enactment by Congress of the veterans ' bonus payment bill over the President 's veto . Goal Is Seen Only for First Year A measure framed along the lines set out in the report submitted today would raise a total of $799,000 , - 000 in additional revenue for one full year 's operation , according to committee estimates , and then would fall off to a permanent annual yield of $616,000,000 . The President requested in his tax message a measure that would produce at least $792,000,000 additional annual revenue for the first three years and $620,000,000 permanently thereafter . The subcommittee 's report was largely a detailed explanation of provisions which it had agreed should go into the new tax bill . Chairman Hill had announced them from day to day during the subcommittee 's survey of the President 's plan . It contained but few major features which had not already been published . In one of these hitherto unrevealed provisions , the subcommittee proposed that railroads should obtain a slight concession in the undistributed profits tax by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subsidiaries . The carriers would not obtain any preferential in the rate of tax , however , as was recommended for banks and insurance companies , except those in receivership . If a parent railway corporation were in receivership , the entire affiliated group would be taxed at a rate recommended for other corporations in like circumstances ( 15 per cent flat on the basis of total net income ) . A single affiliate member in receivership would not receive such preferential treatment . There was considerable question among committee members as to whether railroads would pay more or less tax under the new arrangement than they pay today . Administration Plan Changed In its treatment of the undistributed corporate profits tax , the subcommittee 's report retained the substance but not the form suggested by the President and subsequently recommended in detail by Treasury officials . The President had recommended that a graduated tax be levied on that part of income which a corporation did not distribute in dividends but withheld as undivided profits . His proposal was that the graduated rates should average about 331-3 . His main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual income as dividends to stockholders where , under his proposal , they would be subject to the full normal as well as the surtax income levies of the individual income tax . The average rate of 331-3 per cent on undistributed net income was suggested as about equaling the burden that the same amount of income would bear , on the average , if distributed and taxed in the hands of individual shareholders . The basic principle , as enunciated by the President , was to tax all corporate net income alike , whether held as undivided profits or received by individuals in dividends . In the report adopted by the committee today as a basis for further consideration of the subject , this proposal was considerably altered . In the first place , the basis of the tax was changed so that it would be levied on the whole net income of a corporation and not exclusively on the amount withheld from dividends , but at a rate to be determined by the percentage of income so withheld . This system of rates was calculated to bring about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be induced to build up limited reserves to " cushion " themselves against future business reverses . Two Classes of Corporations Under the proposal for applying the new corporate tax as it now stands , companies would be divided into two classes , those with net incomes of $10,000 or less and those with net incomes of more than $10,000 . They would shift from one group to another accordingly , as their net income went above or below the $10,000 figure . On the first class of corporations , the tax rate would vary from 1 per cent of total net income , levied on the basis of the first 10 per cent held as undivided profits , up to 29.7 per cent , based on 70.3 per cent of undivided profits . Corporations in the second group would be taxed at rates ranging from 4 per cent to 421/2 per cent of their total net income , based on undistributed profits ranging from 10 to 571/2 per cent . The subcommittee proposed in its report that corporations of an " intermediate " net income class , say from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rates applicable to both classifications , thus giving them a slight preferential in their total tax payments . The report recommended , as already disclosed , that banks be exempted from the undistributed profits taxes , and be treated separately with flat rate of 15 per cent on all total net income without regard to distribution . The subcommittee left to the full committee the question as to whether dividends paid by banks to shareholders should be treated under the present law , where they are subject only to surtaxes , or be fully taxable as proposed in the new plan i for dividends distributed by other corporations . Insurance . Companies Exempt The subcommittee also proposed that insurance companies , including mutual and stock companies , foreign and domestic , receive the same treatment as the banks , except that foreign insurance companies , other than life and other mutuals , be subject to a rate of 22% per cent on total net earnings without regard to undistributed income . In all the schedules of rates , the subcommittee made them applicable to " adjusted net income , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deductions permitted by present law are taken , less the credit allowed by Section 26 of the Revenue Act of 1934 relating to interest on Liberty bonds and other obligations of government corporations . That section allows full credit for such interest when corporations are computing their net income tax . As already suggested , the subcommittee recommended that corporations in receivership be treated separately and subject to a flat tax of 15 per cent on annual net taxable inbome , rather than to the new rates on undistributed profits . An exception was recommended also for foreign corporations which , under the subcommittee 's proposal , would be taxed in the future at a flat income tax rate of 221/2 per cent . The subcommittee agreed substantially to the President 's recommendation that existing corporate tax laws be repealed and supplanted in their entirety by the new system . It proposed a delayed repeal of the capital stock and excess profits levies , however , hoping to gather about $83,000,000 from corporations for the calendar year 1936 , in addition to the expected exactions of the new plan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1936 to incomes which must be reported on or before March 15 , 1937 . As to the Present Exemptions The report also recommended repeal of the present exemption of corporate dividends to normal income levies in the hands of individuals , and deletion of the present partial exemption of intercorporate dividends to regular taxation . The subcommittee proposed that dividends paid out of earnings accumulated prior to enactment of the new act be taxed fully as dividends when distributed into the hands of shareholders , just as in the case of the distribution of future earnings . It also recommended that no exemption from tax on the shareholder be given to dividends declared out of earnings of future years on which a corporation has paid taxes under the new plan . The report contained a special recommendation for relief for the corporation which , while having taxable net income for a given year , lacks sufficient accumulated earnings at the close of the year with which to distribute its taxable income in the form of dividends . This might readily occur with corporations seeking to make up for previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its net income as it Is earned from month to month . The subcommittee suggested treatment of such a case as follows : If the accumulated earnings of a corporation at the close of the taxable year ( computed without diminution by reason of the distribution of earnings during the year ) are less than the net taxable income which either must be distributed or taxed as undivided profits , the tax shall be according to the following schedule : ( a ) Twenty-two and one-half per cent of the excess of the net taxable income over the accumulated earnings and profits then in hand . ( b ) A tax upon the remainder of the taxable income computed according to the full force of the undistributed corporate profits tax . Bate in Contract Cases . The subcommittee also recommended that a flat 22% per cent rate be applied to corporations which might be bound by contracts , made prior to Jan. 1 , 1936 , not to pay out any part of its earnings in dividends . The preferential rate would apply only to that part of the income which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested also that , in wiping the slate clean of existing corporate taxes , the punitive levy on personal Molding companies ( Section 351 of the Revenue Act of 1934 ) , and the special tax on improper accumulations of corporate surplus ( Section 102 ) , be repealed . The proposal for a 90 per cent rate for the " windfall " tax was termed by the subcommittee as a tax on " unjust enrichment occurring as a result of the non-payment of excise taxes and related matters . " As previously recalled , the recommendation was made to refund about $35,000,000 in flour taxes paid by intermediate processors , jobbers , wholesalers and retailers under the invalidated AAA and not passed on to the consumer in price increases . Chairman Doughton made a radio appeal tonight for support of the tax plan . He said the only other choices were either a corporation income tax running as high as 25% per cent , or such a steep increase in the excess profits tax as would yield the needed revenue .
