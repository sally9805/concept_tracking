London 's Sotheby &; Co .. famed art auctioneers , recently issued an elaborate 171-page volume with 62 rotogravure plates entitled , " Catalog of the Magnificent Contents of 148 Piccadilly . W. I. " No. 148 Piccadilly , W. I. was built in 1865 by Lionel Nathan de Rothschild , father of the first Baron Rothschild , who was elected to Parliament for the City of London in 1847 but remained unseated for eleven years until the restrictions against Jews were removed . He continued to represent the city until 1874 and finally resigned . Lionel Rothschild filled his house with one of the world 's richest collections of Dutch and Flemish paintings , 18th Century French furniture , carvings , crystal , glass , porcelain , cloisonn , tapestries , chandeliers . Last week the contents of the house , even the iron footscrapers and carriage umbrellas , were up for public Auction . <P> Dealers and collectors thronged the scarlet and gold ballroom , where nine rock crystal chandeliers festooned with crystal drops glittered over their heads . British Broadcasting Corp . had decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the voice of a commentator but little else , because bids were indicated by a flick of an eyebrow or pencil , and also because the announcer was enclosed in a soundproof booth . At the end of three days , the sale 's returns stood at $400,000 . <P> The auction was ordered by Nathaniel Mayer Victor Rothschild , tall , dark , muscular grandson of the first Baron Rothschild and heir , who will be 27 years old next autumn . His reason was not penury but a lack of interest in magnificence . A strong-minded , outspoken young man of modern tastes , he played cricket at Harrow and now golfs , but his major interest is biology . He lives with his wife in a small house in Cambridge , where he has no room for ponderous treasures . He has a small but choice collection of Czannes , Picassos , Renoirs . <P> Most spirited bidding in the furniture section last week was for a secretaire by Martin Carlin , cabinetmaker to Louis XVI , which Dealer Edward Duveen bought for $40,000 . Top price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sons for Pieter de Hooch 's quiet Dutch Courtyard . Less costly but equally decorous were van de Velde 's Calm Sea with Shipping ( $10,500 ) and Metsu 's Woman Cleaning Fish ( $14,000 ) . Victor Rothschild 's ancestors apparently did not go in for nudes.
