The first impression of many a newsreader last week was that poor little Shirley Temple was fried to a crisp ; that Madeleine Carroll was dead-not by the bullet of a rival spy , but by incineration ; that nothing was left of Leo Carrillo but his accent ; that Alice Brady , Virginia Bruce , Miriam Hopkins , Richard Dix . June Lang and Oliver Hardy were not much better than ingredients in a huge Thanksgiving Barbecue . In the press , pictures of these notables were accompanied by such headlines as FOREST FIRES RAZE FILM COLONY HOMES , and FLAMES WRECK HOMES OF STARS ; TOWNS IN PERIL . <P> On investigating further , readers were relieved to find that no one had yet actually been burned to death . Nonetheless , the impression persisted that a gigantic holocaust was destroying most Los Angeles suburbs .

Actually , the buildings were almost all squatters ' huts or beach houses . The Rogers ' home was evacuated because Will Rogers Jr . and his brother Jim wanted to amuse themselves by putting out the nearest tongues of flame with a garden hose . Leo Carrillo 's was evacuated because unlike less energetic movie folk who watched the flames from their porches , he preferred the excitement of riding close on his sleek white horse . <P> Most serious effect of the fire , which did <P> $3,000,000 damage , on the movie industry was that three studios had to stop shooting for one afternoon-one because some hired elephants got restless , two because smoke dimmed the sun .
