About three weeks ago , the ears of SEC Chairman William Orville Douglas tingled with pleasure when he received a telephone call from Partner George Whitney of J. P. Morgan &; Co . Mr. Whitney informed him that vast ( $236,000,000 ) United Corp . was finally willing to discuss registering with SEC under the utility holding company act . <P> Bill Douglas had reason to be pleased , for United has been almost as big a stumbling block in hi 's program of utility simplification as Electric Bond &; Share . United not only is one of the biggest utility holding companies but it is the utility operator 's conception of a beneficent holding company . It exercises no control over the operations of its subsidiaries , its function is wholly financial . In an industry where it is necessary to invest about $6 to do $1 worth of business ( U. S. utilities last year had total gross sales of $2,200,000,000 from a fixed capital of $14,370,000,000 ) financing is vital . Therefore top utility men must be financiers primarily and Wall Street has logically become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground that the system of subsidiary operating companies , pyramided to a peak in Wall Street , provides an irresistible chance to overcapitalize at the expense of stockholder and consumer . Hence , while Electric Bond &; Share " undertook a major court battle against the holding company " death sentence , " United presented seven successive plans to SEC , all designed to enable it to continue to exist in the form of an investment trust . Having turned all the plans down , SEC anticipated few friendly overtures . When these suddenly came from Mr. Whitney about the time that Franklin Roosevelt declared a truce between the New Deal and the utility industry ( TIME , Nov. 22 ) , SEC was delighted . <P> The President 's truce has since gone down the drain in a barrage of New Deal attacks on Big Business . Last week Partner Whitney marched in to see Chairman Douglas in the flesh , told him that , after all , United would not register until the Supreme Court validates the Holding Company Act . What is more , said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In Wall Street word promptly went the rounds that Mr. Whitney 's retreat came after a bitter squabble in the utility family in which members of the industry brought pressure to bear on United Corp . to maintain the united front . Telling the story last week , Commissioner Douglas heaved a long sigh of discouragement . " What can you do ? " he asked .
