Cancer is a wildfire growth of rebel cells . Why and how normal cells suddenly go haywire and pile up into malignant tumors is the crucial research problem in cancer today . Last week , at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Milwaukee , Dr. Herbert Eugene Schmitz and James Ernest Davis of Chicago 's Mercy Hospital prodded the dark cancer whirlpool with one more little ray of light . <P> For a long time , they said , researchers have known that cancer cells consume an abnormally small amount of oxygen . To find out why , Drs . Davis and Schmitz probed an enormous rat tumor , discovered small pockets of poisonous cyanogen gas along its borders . They also confirmed the presence of cyanogen along the edges of a human tumor . Cyanogen gas , in minute amounts , is a normal cellular waste product , ordinarily passed out into the blood stream through porous cell walls . <P> Normally present in veins is a white chemical called indigo , which unites with the oxygen in fresh blood and turns blue. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs , surrenders its oxygen and turns white again . But when fresh blood reaches tissues bloated with cyanogen , the indigo gets stalled and can not give up its oxygen . Between the cyanogen and the indigo blue cells are unable to receive any nourishment , and thus , Drs . Davis and Schmitz suggested , the process of tumor development begins . How this vicious circle could be broken they did not venture to say . <P> *Not to be confused with the plant indigo , which yields a blue dye .
