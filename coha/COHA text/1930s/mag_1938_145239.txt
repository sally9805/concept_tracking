It was the last day of Ramadan , the month in which the Koran was revealed , and in the hill station of Kanwali . A battalion of the King-Emperor 's Indian soldiers were observing Mohammed 's strict law . During Ramadan , it is written , a Moslem must not enjoy the pleasures of food , drink , tobacco and women from that time in the morning when a white thread can be distinguished from a black one , until the hour of the evening when neither can be seen . <P> On that last day of the fast ( Thanksgiving Eve in the U. S. ) most of the soldiers were licking their chops in anticipation of the gorging they would do for the feast of Bairam during the next three days . Among their number , however , was one young sepoy who , half-crazed through abstention , ran amuck during the night . He forced his way into the tent of the battalion 's major , with his rifle shot the major dead in his sleep . Aroused , five other officers-three British and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bang , Bang , Bang , - the sepoy killed all five . The rest of the battalion , believing the fierce Pathans were on the warpath , hastily took up " stand-to " positions around the camp 's wall . Through the darkness they saw the sepoy running away , rifle in hand . A volley of shots burst out and the young soldier assassin dropped dead .
