From one rich U. S. family to another last week passed working control of the Virginian Railway , the 600-mi. model coal road built by the late Standard Oilman Henry Huttleston Rogers in the days of Roosevelt I ( TIME , Dec. 16 , 1935 ) . In Manhattan , Adrian Hoffman Larkin , Virginian Board Chairman and trustee of the Rogers estate , laconically announced that 75% of the Virginian 's common stock had been sold to interests identified with Andrew William Mellon . The consideration , said Mr. Larkin , was in excess of $31,000,000 . Actual purchaser was a group headed by Koppers Co. , Eastern Gas &; Fuel Associates and First Boston Corp . The presence of First Boston ( see p. 52 ) irr what was otherwise a pure Mellon deal could be explained by the fact that that big underwriting concern plays banker to Eastern Gas &; Fuel . Though the Mellons bought 236,000 of Virginian 's 312,700 shares of common , they did not acquire a voting majority , the road 's preferred stock ( 279,550 shares ) also having voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs the Mellons got about 40% , which is enough to dominate almost any railroad 's council . Among the fantastic motives ascribed to the Mellons in their purchase last week was the wish to even a mythical grudge against Pennsylvania R. R.-by diverting traffic . Aside from the fact that the Mellons are big Pennsy stockholders ( young Richard Mellon is a Pennsy director ) , the Mellons have another good reason to keep on the best terms with as many railroads as possible : they are heavily interested in National Lumber &; Creosoting Co. , which treats railroad ties and telegraph poles . For a strategic reason for the deal , it was necessary only to look at the Virginian 's traffic , which is 90% bituminous coal . Its coal route over the Alleghenies from West Deepwater , W. Va . to deeper water at Hampton Roads , Va . is the shortest , easiest . And one of its best customers is the Koppers group of coke , gas and by-products companies , for all of which coal is the basic raw material . The Mellons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great game of railroad strategy for the sheer thrill of it . The Virginian is a choice investment . It stayed in the black throughout Depression , earned $11.44 for each share of its common stock in the first ten months of last year .
