( See front cover ) <P> At four o'clock one morning last May two cheap sedans collided at the corner of Manhattan 's 86th Street and Central Park West . Eight people were badly smashed up . The driver of one of the cars was laid out on the sidewalk on a seat cushion , and as an uninjured friend knelt over him waiting for the ambulances to come , he kept repeating : " Oh I 'm hurt bad in the chest . My chest 's hurt bad . " <P> Suddenly the friend looked up , recognizing a face he had seen in a newspaper . " There 's Walter Winchell , " he said . " Maybe he 'll put something in the paper about you . " <P> The man on the cushion stared up at the black sky and said in the same flat , unsurprised " voice : " Oh I 'm hurt bad in the chest-hello . Walter-my chest 's hurt bad . " <P> Nearly every journalist has at one time or another tried to explain or describe the Winchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk on Central Park West stands as the most eloquent expression to date of the U. S. people 's complete and final acceptance of Walter Winchell 's permeating ubiquity . A decade of gags and wisecracks about the omnipresence of the premier gossip of his time was at last confirmed . <P> Sunday before last over an NBC chain , Walter Winchell barked as usual . " Good evening Mr. and Mrs. North America and all the ships at sea , " and , having bounced up and down in his old armchair and yelled secrets for 15 minutes , concluded his seventh broadcasting season . Last Thursday he concluded his column by observing that " that society lady is so nuts about titles she 'll probably end up with Joe Louis-who HAS one . " He did not mention that he himself was ending up his 14th year in the newspaper business and going on a month 's vacation . <P> All told , it was his best year . For two movies ( Wake Up And Live , Love And Hisses ) , he had made $150,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndicated column which reached 7,200,000 people through 140 newspapers had paid him $89,700. * He had never before been so fully seen , heard , read or paid . And , having progressed from a scandal to a national institution , the Winchell story had become more fabulous than any that even he had ever told . <P> Up From the Car . Almost every night that he is in Manhattan , Walter Winchell drives up to Harlem and down 116th Street . There , on the north side of the street between Fifth and Lenox Avenues , stands Public School 184 which gave him all the academic education he ever got-from grades one through six . The car tracks where he was run over while he was playing ball in the street have been taken up , but further up the block toward Lenox the Regun Theatre still stands . It used to be called the Imperial . There he got his first job-as a singing usher-and played his first professional engagement . It was a song &; dance act billed as " McKinley , Stanley &; Lawrence " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Wiener . All were under twelve .
