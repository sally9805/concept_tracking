TWO WORLDS-Lester Cohen-Coviet , Friede. ( $3.50 ) . <P> When Hawthorne wrote his grim Glimpses of English Poverty he started a tradition for U. S. authors of travel books which has persisted ever since . Brooding , melancholy , suspicious of the claims of foreign patriots , Hawthorne found little to cheer him except the occasional kindness shown by slum children to children still smaller . Critic Edmund Wilson was writing in that classic , if somewhat astringent , mood when last month he offered his skeptical impressions of the U. S. and the U. S. S. R. in Travels in Two Democracies . For most of his long ( 412 pages ) Two Worlds , Lester Cohen also adopts the tired tone of his predecessors , finding little to awaken his enthusiasm , much to depress him in his glimpses of poverty in many lands . Bright exception to his historic pessimism is his excitement about the Soviet Union . <P> Lester Cohen was born 34 years ago in Chicago , wrote a novel of department-store life ( Sweepings ) which became a bestseller , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says in Two Worlds that after years of this work he set forth " bound for the beauty and wonder of the world , and a better understanding of our troubled , chaotic time . " With his wife he went first to France , then to England , where he listened to debates in Parliament about fascism , then to Russia , Turkey , Greece , Palestine , Egypt , Ceylon , India , China , Japan . Since they traveled over conventional paths and by conventional methods , they had few adventures , were interested in the normal life in different classes rather than in picturesque or exciting exceptions . The Russia they saw has come to be a familiar land to readers of travel books , a country of new cities , new buildings , new plans , of confusion , enthusiasm , inefficiency . Lester Cohen 's most refreshing Russian experience was his visit to a model self-governing prison colony at Lubertze . There the prisoners were given vacations , were punished by being expelled . Despite Lester Cohen 's enthusiasm for the Soviet Union , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , encountered many citizens who grumbled at the way things were going . <P> Best part of Two Worlds deals with China . Lester Cohen had wanted to find out something definite about the Chinese Soviets in the interior , had even contemplated trying to visit them . But after he had lived in Shanghai , Nanking , Soochow , Peiping , met an anti-Japanese volunteer who used a cigaret tin for a gas mask , seen " bandit-artists " being led off to jail because their pictures ran counter to government decrees , been offered a Chinese virgin for $17 , his desire to learn more about the Chinese revolutionists left him . Day after day he thought he could see the social fabric wearing away , and " at moments it seemed that anyone , almost anyone , could have led these people on . "
