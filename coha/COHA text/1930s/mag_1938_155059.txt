Six years ago Belgium was officially divided into three language zones : French only for the Walloons , Flemish only in the Flemish districts , both French and Flemish in Brussels and suburbs . As a practical measure , both tongues were retained on signs along the language frontiers and in areas visited by tourists . This seemed like good business even to the most zealous Fleming , but to Florimond Grammens it appeared as sabotage of the language laws . Believing in direct action , M. Grammens bought a brush and a pot of black paint , began to wander along the countryside hunting out French inscriptions which hurt his patriotic Flemish feelings . Soon numerous young Flemish students joined him . <P> All this seemed a good joke until the city fathers of Tongres decided to punish zealous M. Grammens for spoiling the markings on their municipal buildings . Sentenced to a month 's imprisonment . Painter Grammens became overnight a Flemish martyr . The embarrassed Government released him after only two weeks in jail . <P> In less than 24 hours Florimond Grammens had resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gay students in an Anschluss raid into the predominantly French town of Enghien , intending to paint it Flemish . Equally zealous French-speaking students drove them off . <P> Having tired of one short jail sentence after another , Painter Grammens recently announced an armistice of sorts : no more daubing on official buildings , but plenty of attention to such private undertakings as shops , hotels , garage owners , doctors . Meanwhile , the Belgium Royal Commission on Names and Dialects made haste to appease M. Grammens and all Flemish nationalists . Announced last week was a change of name for hundreds of Belgian towns and villages . Samples : Leuven for Louvain , Ieper for Ypres , Brugge for Bruges , Kortrijk for Courtrai.
