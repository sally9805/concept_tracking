And what is my darling doing ? p. 3 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Your darling has been polishing his boots . ( He leans back on the pillows . ) He is drawing the covers over his wasted limbs and trying to forget that there is no coal in the stove . ( TATIANA enters up L.C. , with a shirt rolled into a ball . She comes to the edge of the bed and shakes it out . ) And what , in the blessed name of St. Christopher , is that ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Your shirt , darling . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF My ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA I washed it with my own hands . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( horrified ) . That is my shirt ? That  --  that fragment ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes , darling , your shirt .

PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( melting ) . Oh , my darling  --  my sweet , my beautiful ! ( He seizes her hand and attempts to draw her down on to the bed . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( resisting and taking a step C. ) . No , you fool ! I have work ( She crosses R. and hangs up the shirt on the line . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Tatiana ! How can I beg for your forgiveness ? You sacrificed the last of your chemises  --  and I complain at the loss of a mere shirt-tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint , Tatiana , a saint ; GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing to the bed ) . You 're sure of that ? ( She sits on the end of the bed . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF It 's the very word that was used by your august cousin , my Imperial Master . ( They both make the sign of the cross . ) He said : " In marrying Tatiana Petrovna , you marry a saint ! " p. 5 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( kneeling on the bed and stroking his hair ) . He knew me very well . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF He was speaking of your devotion  --  but not of your manners . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( indignantly ) . And is there anything wrong with my manners ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( indulgently ) . Oh  --  you ca n't be blamed for them . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Blamed ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You were born a Grand Duchess , so you lacked the opportunity for social contacts that was given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA What do you mean ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Wherever you go , I have to act as interpreter for you .

But why ? p. 6 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Obey me ! ( She rises from the bed and leans against the washstand up L.C. ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF But  --  my darling  --  this bed is so warm and so comfortable . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( solemnly ) . Mikail Alexandrovitch Ouratieff , at what-ever sacrifice of your comfort , I command you to get up . ( She is being very stern , very imperious . There should be no suggestion of bantering in her lone . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( sighing as he rises ) . All right . ( He swings his bare feet out of bed , L. side , and as he rises steps on his boot . He leans over and starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( up L.C. ) . Put that shoe down ! And come over here . ( He obeys ruefully , crossing to C. ) And offer your apologies . ( MIKAIL advances towards her slowly , and when he is close to her attempts to click his bare heels together and bows low . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF My beloved Tatiana p. 7 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( moving to the end of the bed and sitting ) . Your apologies will be expressed in official form . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF General Prince Mikail Alexandrovitch Ouratieff , aide-de-camp to His Imperial Majesty , offers Her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna his very humble apologies . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Approach ! ( MIKAIL obeys , crossing to her and coming very close to her . She gives him a vigorous slap on the face . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Ouch ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( angrily ) . How dare you say " ouch " ! You 're an officer . You are not permitted to feel pain . PRINCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is withdrawn .

How good it is to be Russian . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And insane ! Life for us is very , very sad and very , very beautiful . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA And so tiresome . I 'm starving . ( She sits up . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF So am I , Tatiaschka . There 's a horrible gnawing emptiness in my soul . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA I was not speaking of souls . I 'm hungry here . ( She slaps her stomach . ) Give me some money . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( astounded ) . Money ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes  --  I 'm going shopping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Mikail ! Do n't tell me there 's none left . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( sighing ) . There is the sum of one hundred francs , Tatiana . That is all . p. 9 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( brightly , as she rises and crosses up R. ) . But that is enough . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And out of the hundred , we owe eighty to the proprietor of this lamentable hotel . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA That little nuisance ! Have n't we trained him in the virtue of patience ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF He has the gout , my Tatiana , so he can not climb six fights of stairs , but he must be paid eighty francs to-day . Other-wise GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing back C. ) . Very well  --  he shall be paid ! I shall give him his eighty francs to-day , and to-morrow he shall lend us two hundred . ( She sits in the armchair R.C. and takes her shoes from underneath . ) ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk , very competent , when she chooses . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF But will he ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( doing up her shoes ) . I 'll appeal to his snobbery . For two hundred francs I 'll make him Count of Pultava ! p. 10 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( scornfully ) . A Count . Do you think that would impress him ! Why , last week for only fifty francs you made him a Duke  --  GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Did I ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Duke of Courlande . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( rising to L. of the chair ) . Very well , then  --  I can do better than that : to-morrow he will become a Grand Duke  --  entitled to precede himself in to dinner . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( overwhelmed with admiration ) . Tatiana , what resource ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Resourcefulness has been thrust upon us , my pigeon ! ( She pauses momentarily in her dressing to assume an attitude . ) We are two against the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) . No ! Not two  --  only one  --  you ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( stepping towards him ) . Ah , Mikail ! How far do you suppose I could go in life without you ? p. 11 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( sitting on the bed again ) . Come , Tatiana . Get back into this bed . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA No ! Give me the hundred francs . ( Regretfully he reaches under the pillow and takes out a hundred-franc note . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You will surely pay eighty of these to the Duke of Courlande ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes ! He 'll be paid  --  his eighty francs . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF That will leave twenty francs . Bring back at least ten of it . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( taking the note ) . I shall pay the landlord eighty frames and buy the food , and bring back eighty franes . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( anxiously ) . Tatiana  --  I do n't understand your arithmetic  --  GRAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I suspect the honesty of your intentions . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( turning to him ) . Darling , do you trust me ? p. 12 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Within reason , my love . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Then believe me . I swear , by Saint Peter and Saint Paul  --  I swear to bring back eighty-five frames . ( She counts on her fingers . ) I shall bring back ninety francs ! I shall buy some cutlets of horse and some potatoes , and I shall bring back ninety-five francs and two artichokes ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Tatiana , you 're very fond of artichokes , are n't you ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing C. ) No , I hate them , but while the grocer is selecting the poorest potatoes , I shall be left alone amongst the artichokes . ( She crosses to the chest of drawers R. and puts on her hat . ) ( MIKAIL looks heavenward . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( reverently ) . I humbly beg that the Father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not see the Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna , cousin to the Tsar ( he makes the sign of the cross ) , arrested for stealing artichokes . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Nonsense ! I am never arrested ! p. 13 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You have been incredibly lucky . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing back C. with a string bag ) . Oh , no , Mikail , it is more than luck . It is the intervention of God  --  the God of all the Russias . Why  --  the other day , the grocer almost saw me as I was letting a bunch of radishes fall into this bag , but his eyes were miraculously diverted to the ceiling . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( with decision  --  rising ) . Tatiana  --  give me that bag . ( Stepping C. ) I shall go myself . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA No ! By St. Christopher , no ! A General of Cavalry to be seen in the streets of Paris with cutlets of horse ! Never ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing R. and putting the bag on the table ) . A Grand Duchess is above appearances ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( with resignation ) . Very well  --  go on and commit your pathetic thieveries . But what of to-morrow  --  and all the tomorrows that follow ? The Russian God may grow weary of diverting grocers ' eyes . p. 14 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Then we will find something to sell . ( She crosses back C. , and puts on her coat . ) We have always found PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF There 's not much left . ( He looks about the room with a sigh . ) Except my sword . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( turning C. ) . The sword of Alexander the Third ! Never ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And the flag GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA The flag of the Imperial Guard ! Better let us die together , wrapped in its folds ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Then that leaves nothing but the ikon . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ikon ; faces the ikon and crosses herself . ) I would sooner sell my body . ( She walks towards the door . ) I 'm going . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( crossing to the window R. ) . Wait ! ( He goes to the window and looks out . ) The police officer is still there . p. 15 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Which one is it to-day ? ( She moves to above the armchair . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF The little dark one with the military medal . ( He makes a little friendly sign to the unseen policeman . ) He has a nice , friendly face . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing down to R. of him ) . I 'll bring him back a packet of cigarettes . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Good ones , I hope . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Oh , the best . ( A knock is heard on the door R.C. They look at each other in some alarm . ) Did you hear a knock ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The knock is repeated . ) If it is our landlord , the Duke of Courlande GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA If it is , I shall deal with him . ( She moves to below the table R.C. ) ( MIKAIL goes to the door up R.C. and opens it . OLGA , a dark , pretty , but savage-looking little midinette , comes in . She is carrying a hat-box . She affects timorousness. ) p. 16 OLGA Madame Courtois ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Who ? OLGA I have a hat here for Madame Courtois . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( L. of the door R.C. ) . We do n't doubt it , my dear child . But she is not here . OLGA This is not her flat ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF That is the unhappy fact . OLGA But the concierge told me ( She is looking about the room , in seeming bewilderment , when she happens to see the ikon . ) ( Excitedly . ) You are Russians ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF We can not disguise it . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down R.C. to TATIANA ) . But I should have known at once . Your Highness ! ( She puts the hat-box on the armchair , goes to TATIANA , kneels before her and kisses the hem of her skirt . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( appreciatively , stepping down L.C. ) . Charming ! p. 17 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Stand up , my child . OLGA Have I Your Highness 's pardon for my stupidity ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Of course you have . Come now  --  stand up . ( OLGA rises . ) OLGA It was all the concierge 's fault . He told me distinctly that I would find Madame Courtois in Room Four and I GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes , I know ; the concierge is an idiot . Go , my child . ( She picks up the hat-box . ) Ask him again in very short , simple words and perhaps he 'll ( Something about the weight of the hat-box causes her to break off short . OLGA is trying to take the hat-box , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Highness ! Thank you ! And grant me again your august pardon . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Wait . I think I 'd like to see that hat . ( OLGA goes for the hat-box . ) OLGA No . Your Highness . ( She puts out her hand . ) It 's not GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA I might decide to buy it . ( She is starting to open the hat-box. ) p. 18 OLGA ( frantically ) . I promise Your Highness , it is hideous  --  it will be an insult on your head . ( TATIANA opens the box , MIKAIL rushes across to the table , examines the contents of the box and takes out some leaflets . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Well , at least it contains no high explosives . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( R. of the table ) . What is it , Mikail ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Some very interesting documents . ( Reading in mock oratory . ) " Workers of France , arise ! Join your Russian brothers in the United Front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she is in millinery . ( To OLGA . ) Well , Tovarich , what do you want from us ? OLGA ( viciously ) . What are you going to do with that money ? ( MIKAIL is C. OLGA L.C. ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Our hundred francs ? We 're going to buy artichokes . OLGA The money you stole from Russia ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Stole ? p. 19 OLGA Thieves ! It came from the blood and the sweat of the millions , and now you hold it for yourselves GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Mikail ! Tell her to go . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Not yet , my darling . ( To OLGA . ) Who sent you here ? OLGA Do you believe I 'd tell you ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( stepping to her ) . No  --  but I do n't mind asking . Was it Gorotchenko ? OLGA ( defiantly ) . I do n't know . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF What information did you expect to get out of us ? OLGA I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian communist or one of these dubious French ones ? OLGA ( doggedly ) . I do n't know . ( TATIANA takes a step C. , laughs and picks up the hat-box . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Here , my dear . Take this charming hat to Madame Courtois . ( OLGA takes it . ) I 'm sure she 'll look lovely in it . ( MIKAIL crosses to the end of the bed . ) And tell Gorotchenko we 'd be grateful if some day he would honour us with his own presence . ( OLGA goes to the door. ) p. 20 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( crossing to OLGA up C. ) . And tell him that you found us still in good health , though slightly under-nourished . Tell him we 're prepared , at any moment , to be caught in one of the traps which he is thoughtfully laying for us . And when he has caught us he can burn us , by slow degrees , in the scorching flames of Red Terror  --  ( OLGA laughs. ) but our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million , not a thousand , not a sou ! OLGA Fine talk , you white-livered thieves . You think you 're safe with your money . Because you 're in Paris , in the bourgeois fortress , with gendarmes to guard you . ( MIKAIL sits on the bed . TATIANA , down R. , pays no attention . ) But we know how to take bank what was stolen from us . And when we do , we 'll also take your miserable , worthless , evil lives . ( She turns , blows out the ikon and exits up R.C. , slamming the door . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing up C. ) . The little beast ! Where are the matches ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( jumping off the bed ) . Matches ? Ah ! ( He searches and finds them on the cupboard down L. ) Here they are . ( He hands them to TATIANA . She relights the ikon. ) p. 21 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Of all the spies that have been inflicted on us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us to suppose that such a vicious little fool could accomplish anything . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( seriously ) . You know , Tatiana  --  some day one of them will kill us . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( C. , calmly ) . I do n't doubt it . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( R. of the bed ) . You 're not afraid ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( looking at him levelly ) . Are you ? ( By way of response he kisses her , holds her close to him for a moment , then turns and wanders towards the bed . ) Mikail , do n't tell me you are going back to bed ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( getting on to the bed ) . Yes . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA You 'd better put your clothes on . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF But my shirt is not dry . ( He stands on the bed and puts the bedclothes round him. ) p. 22 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA You must be ready for more visitors . PRINCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with bankers . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing to the bed ) . You can cope with them better with your clothes on . You must realize that they do n't understand the simple dignity of the Russian soul . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Then I shall show it to them again in all its undauntable ( he lies down and pulls the clothes up ) unshakable ( he pulls the covers over him ) untiring strength ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( standing above the bed ) . And whatever they promise , you will not give in . ( MIKAIL has the bedclothes up to his nose . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Not a billion , not a million , not a thousand , not a sou ! ( He lies on his side and yawns . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( kneeling on the bed , upstage side ) . God preserve you , my gallant love ! And I shall buy a dinner worthy of a true servant of the Tsar . ( She makes the sign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good-bye , my pigeon . ( She exits up R.C. MIKAIL goes to sleep . Suddenly there is a knock at the door. ) p. 23 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Come in . ( The door is opened by GENERAL COUNT BREKENSKI , aide-de-camp to the current pretender to the Russian throne . Behind him is CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF , Governor of the Bank of France . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Is Prince Ouratieff receiving ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Come in , gentlemen ! ( CHAUFFOURIER and BREKENSKI come down C. ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF I beg your pardon . Did we awaken you ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF No , no ! I 've merely been resting after cleaning my boots . One moment ( He jumps out of bed , picks up a monocle from the table L. of the bed , puts it in his eye , turns to them and bows with dignity . ) Gentlemen ! ( He moves L.C. ) ( The others bow . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Allow me to introduce myself , Excellency . I am Chauffourier-Dubieff , Governor of the Bank of France . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself begs you to forgive him . He is in Rome at the moment , but after his return he will be pleased to call on you whenever you are dis-engaged. p. 24 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You may assure him that I am in a permanent state of disengagement . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF In view of the urgency he begged me to see you this morning and perhaps pave the way for a complete understanding . ( A cough from COUNT BREKENSKI calls attention to his presence . ) Oh ! I beg your pardon  --  but , of course , Excellency , you know each other . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I 'm afraid I COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI ( introducing himself ) . Count Feodor Androvitch Brekenski , honorary colonel of the Seventeenth Regiment of Uhlans , honorary page to His Imperial Majesty Alexander the Second , honorary Governor of Jitomir PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I am honoured to meet so distinguished a compatriot . ( He removes the monocle from his eye . ) Forgive me , gentlemen , but this damned thing is annoying me . Perhaps I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the washstand to put down his monocle , then moves R. to get his shirt , which TATIANA has hung up to dry . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( quickly ) . I beg you , Excellency . We are all men together . p. 25 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( moving up R. to get the small chair ) . That 's right  --  so we are . Sit down , gentlemen . ( He places the chair C. for CHAUFFOURIER , then picks up the circulars from the floor and puts then in the stove . Coming to the end of the bed . ) I can only apologize for the many inadequacies of our home ! ( CHAUFFOURIER sits on the chair C. BREKENSKI sits in the armchair . MIKAIL sits on the end of the bed . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF No apologies are needed , Excellency . Indeed , I must render homage to the heroism , the grandeur of your  --  may I say sublime  --  poverty ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You may say it , my dear sir  --  ( softly )  --  but not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI And believe me , my dear friend , your deplorable situation in this hotel is a source of constant grief to His Imperial Majesty . He , too , is ready at any moment to renew his offer of a pension . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I can never sufficiently express my gratitude to His Highness , and to the French Government . Go on , gentlemen . p. 26 CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Excellency  --  I have ascertained the exact sum total of your account at the Bank of France to date . Will you authorize me to make the figure known to Count Brekenski ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF With the greatest of pleasure . ( CHAUFFOURIER takes out a small note-book from which he reads : ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF With all compound interest included , the account of Prince Ouratieff amounts to exactly three billion , eight hundred and eighty-three million , tow hundred thousand and sixty-two francs , sixty-five centimes . ( To BREKENSKI . ) Sixty-five . ( He closes the book . ) In round figures , four billion francs . COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( sadly ) . It impressed me once . But  --  one can get used to anything  --  even to the possession of four billion francs . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Excellency  --  how long must we continue with this absurd situation ? That vast sum of money is lying idle , doing no good to you nor to anyone . Can you forget that France , the unshakable ally of your lamented sovereign , is to-day struggling against the most bitter difficulties ! p. 27 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I know , my dear Governor . I regret it with all my heart . France 's sorrows are my sorrows . France has given sanctuary to me , and to many of my countrymen ; at great risk of her national security , she has allowed some of us to drive taxis . She is queen among realms , mistress of all mankind . But that money is not mine , it belongs to the Tsar . COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI Exactly ! And that is just CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Yes  --  but it could so easily be converted into French Government bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans , each one more COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI ( interrupting ) . Without forgetting , either , that our holy Russia is groaning under its tyrants , that His Imperial Majesty is ready to put himself at the head of his generous loyalists , to reconquer the sacred soil whenever the funds for this campaign are forthcoming . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( vehemently , pulling his chair slightly towards the bed ) . Millions which the Bank of France is perfectly ready to advance , against the conversion into any one of twelve State loans COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI You will be the Liberator of Russia , the restorer of the throne . p. 28 CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( pulling his chair yet a shade nearer ) . Need I add that my Government will be happy to render  --  homage , as extensive as it would be discreet , to your affectionate confidence ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Gentlemen , gentlemen this is all very fine but ca n't we be more precise ? You are about to offer me something . What is it ? CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( quickly ) . Fifteen million francs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the counsels of the New Imperial Russia . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Think of it , Excellency , high honour and financial security to the end of your days . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Fifteen millions , to a man who can order four billion boiled eggs for breakfast ! Gentlemen , it is ludicrous ! ( He rises . ) However , my dear Count , I authorize you to say to His Highness that my sword and my fortune are entirely his ( Exclamations of joy from BREKENSKI and CHAUFFOURIER . Both rise . MIKAIL crosses between them . ) And that I ask no compensation either from His Imperial Highness , or from the French Government . p. 29 COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI Oh , Excellency ! All of holy Russia is in you debt . ( Very moved , he walks up to MIKAIL with outstretched hand . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( in the same way ) . Excellency ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( raising his hands in modesty ) . Gentlemen gentlemen . You are making too much fuss over the proffered services of one soldier and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI ( stammering ) . Twenty francs ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF That 's what I 'll have left after paying my hotel bill . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF But the four billions . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF That is not mine to give . COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI Quite right . It is the property of His Imperial Majesty , heir to the throne . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF No , Count Brekenski , it is not his property . I received that money from the hands of a Tsar it is into the hands of a Tsar that I shall give it back . p. 30 COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI There are Courts of Justice in Paris . ( He drops down R. ) His Imperial Majesty will demand restitution . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( softly , to CHAUFFOURIER ) . My dear Governor , will you explain to Count Brekenski that all the Judges of France in all their dignity can not dispossess Prince Ouratieff of a bank account which stands legally in his name ? CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF But , Excellency , what does our Bank ask ? A xssimple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI ( with signs of anger ) . Prince Ouratieff , you doubtless have your own reasons for your arrogant stubbornness , but permit me to say that , in my eyes , your refusal suggests not only bad faith , but downright treason . ( He turns away to the window . ) And I fell sure that His Imperial Majesty will agree PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Great , God ! If I refuse to agree to this mere matter of book-keeping , I 'm a traitor . ( He turns up C. ) So be it , gentlemen . But I must remain free to make my own mistakes in my own way . That was my master 's wish . The Tsar of Russia trusted me . He knew that calamity was at hand , and a few weeks before the Revolution he caused those colossal sums to be placed in the Bank of France in my name and at my disposal . His only stipulation to me was that I should administer it in the best interests of my sovereign . Make careful note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sovereign . I am serving those interests  --  perhaps stupidly  --  but with all the devotion at my command . I see no reason to squander that money in the financing of a counter-revolution which would only end in grotesque and horrible failure . p. 31 COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI You are speaking for yourself , prince Ouratieff . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Precisely . And for myself I say to you  --  not a billion , not a million , not a thousand , not a sou ! It was a crowned Tsar , not a pretender , who gave it to me . ( BREKENSKI looks annoyed . ) ( He crosses down to L. of BREKENSKI . ) And to a crowned Tsar it will be returned . ( To CHAUFFOURIER . ) Of course , a General of Cavalry is n't supposed to know much about business , but I received this money in gold  --  not in paper  --  and in gold it will be given back . I tell you this , gentlemen , ( CHAUFFOURIER bows and picks up his hat from his chair. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity for any further visits to this dismal quarter of Paris . ( He feels if his shirt is dry . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Have you considered the possibility of your death ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( coming C. ) . I am reminded of that frequently . But God is a Russian . He will take care of the money and me  --  after I have been murdered . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Murdered ? p. 32 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( calmly ) . Yes . COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI Your life has been threatened ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF The representatives of the other Russia are also very interested in those four billion francs . I think they will spare no effort to get them . COUNT FEODOR BREKENSKI But it is unthinkable that they might PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Do n't worry , my dear Count , they may seize me ; they may bring you my hand  --  but not my signature . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Do n't you worry , your Excellency . Our police are excessively vigilant . Why  --  would you believe it ?  --  in this district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing of it at once . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( stepping to CHAUFFOURIER ) . An artichoke ? CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Oh , it 's nothing . The grocer is instructed to look the other way . Oh , we handle it with the utmost discretion . The bills for your provisions are sent first to the local Police Station , who transmit them to Headquarters , whence they go to the Foreign Office for approval and then to the bureau of the Secret Funds for payment . The matter is handled by four different Government departments . ( As MIKAIL tries to break in . ) You may consider that a great deal of official machinery for one artichoke . But it is that very thoroughness which accounts for the greatness of France . p. 33 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( greatly perturbed ) . My dear Governor , I am terribly upset about this . I assure you it shall never happen again . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Do n't give it another thought , Excellency . ( BREKENSKI turns to the window R. ) You and Her Highness are extraordinarily modest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounded at your ability to live on such a small quantity of food . The French Government is perfectly able to pay your bills even in these crucial times . And we are glad to do so . We are your friends  --  your well-wishers  --  ever eager to help in every way possible  --  to restore you to the estate which is so rightfully yours . ( At this moment the door R.C. opens and in comes TATIANA . She comes down to the table . Her shopping-bag is swelled to bursting point with various provisions . Besides this , she holds a superb bottle of champagne in one hand , and under her other arm is a large bundle of gay flowers . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( horrified ) . Oh , Tatiana  --  ( He turns up C. ) TATIANA above the table , looks at the two gentlemen with amiable curiosity . CHAUFFOURIER is C. , BREKENSKI R. of the table , and MIKAIL by the end of the bed. ) p. 34 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( severely ) . Tatiana , may I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and Count Brekenski . ( Chauffourier crosses to her . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA How do you do ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Her Imperial Highness , the Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna , Princess Ouratieff , my wife . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Imperial Highness , this honour ( The tow gentlemen bow low . BREKENSKI comes forward to kiss TATIANA 'S hand . She puts down the shopping-bag on the table , also the champagne and the flowers . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Forgive me  --  one moment ( She thrusts her hand into the top of her blouse and draws out a superb artichoke and then another , which she places on the table . She smiles apologetically at BREKENSKI . ) They were scratching me . ( She then extends her hand and BREKENSKI kisses it with deep reverence . She withdraws her hand . ) Enough ! I must put these in water . ( She picks up the jug from the washstand and exits L.C. MIKAIL goes up C. , opens the door , then comes down again. ) p. 35 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will retire . ( BREKENSKI crosses up to the door R.C. and both gentlemen exit . MIKAIL sees that CHAUFFOURIER has left his gloves on the bed and picks them up . He then crosses up to the door , replacing the chair up R. as he goes . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( calling R. of the door ) . My dear Governor ! ( He comes to above the table . ) ( Chauffourier returns hastily up R.C. , full of hope . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Excellency ? You have changed your mind ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You are forgetting your gloves . ( He gives them to him . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF But now that we are alone ( MIKAIL picks up the artichokes and , with a hasty gesture , thrusts them , with the gloves , into CHAUFFOURIER 'S hat . He then shows him the door . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Precisely ! CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF And I trust that you will enjoy a most excellent dinner as guests of France !

( She crosses to the table . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Two hundred francs a pound . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Mikail ! You must n't speak about the cost of it . You sound like a tradesman . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Tatiana , did you pay the hotel bill ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( laying the cloth ) . I could n't find our dear landlord , the Duke of Courlande . ( She gets knives and forks from the drawer . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Tatiana ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA I looked for him everywhere . Really I did . p. 37 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And you spent our entire fortune ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Darling , I had to . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without caviare and champagne ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( with heat ) .

PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And what is the fourth of November to us ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA It 's the day of the victory ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF What victory ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( indignantly  --  stepping to him ) . Samarcand . On the fourth of November , 1487  --  PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Five hundred years ago ! ( He crosses and falls on the bed . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA And what is five hundred years to eternal Russia ? ( She looks among the things on the table . ) The artichokes ?

Did you let them hoodwink you into  --  PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( turning to her ) . Tatiana Petrovna  --  we shall have to move . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( sitting above him ) . Move ? From this hotel ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Perhaps from France itself . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA But why ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Because we 're wards of the State . I 've learned why the grocer looks the other way , and it 's nothing to do with the Russian God . He is commanded to do so by the benevolent French Government  --  who pay for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETROVNA ROMANOVA Pay for them ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Yes , and it 's handled by four different Government departments . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA The swine ! Putting us in their debt ! Mikail  --  ( she rises and crosses C. ) we must pay them . You must find out how much it is and pay them  --  every last sou . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( sitting on the end of the bed ) . But how ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Take the money from the bank . ( She kneels at the R. end of the bed . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Never ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA But it would only be a little bit , to save our honour . Surely , Heaven would forgive us that . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Tatiana , I would not dare . If I touch a penny of that money , we 're lost . I do n't do things by halves . In a fortnight we should be living at the Ritz . No , my darling  --  our honour has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this side of the grave . ( TATIANA has burst into tears. ) p. 40 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA And I was so sure it was my cleverness . I was so sure I 'd outwitted them all . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( infinitely sympathetic ) . Neither of us ever dreamed they could be guilty of such dishonesty . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA And I was also so careful never to take too much . Only just what we barely needed . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I know , Tatiana . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA If I 'd only known how they were deceiving us if I 'd only known . I 'd have taken caviare every day ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Of course you would , my darling  --  and now you know why we must leave .

( She crosses down R. ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF It is n't for fun . ( Crossing to the table . ) It 's for food ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA But what could you do ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Admiral Soukhomine works . He drives a taxi . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes  --  and he kills more people than he ever did with all his battleships . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( above the table ) . And Colonel Trepanoff  --  he works at the Kasbek  --  doing the dagger dance . Two daggers in the belt , and another in the teeth . ( Crossing C. ) I could do that . ( He prepares to demonstrate with knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes  --  and while you were dancing , what would I be doing ? Waiting all night , outside some filthy cabaret , with bandages to tie you together again when the dagger slipped . No ! I shall do the work . ( She takes the knives from him and puts them on the table. ) p. 42 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes . ( Behind the table . ) I 've been invited to pose for an artist . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Who is he ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing to L. of the armchair ) . I do n't know . I met him at the wine merchant 's . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF He spoke to you ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA He was very sweet .

PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And you would so far degrade yourself GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would do anything to keep you away from daggers and taxis because I love you . ( After a moment , both on the floor , MIKAIL takes her in his arms . For a while , they sit together in silence . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I have thought the matter over ; I 've decided you will not pose in the nude no matter how sweet he may be . p. 43 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA But I will not starve ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I 've heard it is n't a bad death . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA I refuse to die  --  or let you die . For if we are gone what will become of all those billions ? They 'll be orphans  --  helpless and alone . We must find a way to live , Mikail ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Condemned to misery and hunger all the days GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes  --  misery and hunger  --  the greatest luxuries of our race !

She is pining away with hunger , and the little brat with thirst . So  --  if you could spare any little gift . p. 45 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA If we had only a thousand francs left in the world , we should give a thousand francs .

Or am I supposed to manage this house as well as the grumbling stockholders who hammer and yammer at me all day ? FERNANDE DUPONT I 've seen dozens of servants in the past week . They were all either escaped convicts or congenital idiots . CHARLES DUPONT Well  --  if you see any more escaped convicts , engage them . Either that or we 'll move to a hotel . ( He goes to the desk . He bends down to look under the desk , but straightens up , holding his forehead . ) Oh ! FERNANDE DUPONT What 's the matter ? CHARLES DUPONT I have the most horrible headache . FERNANDE DUPONT Then go and take some aspirin . CHARLES DUPONT I 've already swallowed the whole bottle . But it 's some kind of neuralgia . It 's like a dentist 's drill boring into my brain , here . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supra-orbital nerve . ) FERNANDE DUPONT ( stroking his head ) . My poor darling ! CHARLES DUPONT ( capitalizing her sympathy  --  crossing C. ) . I do n't see how I 'm going to stand much more of this , Fernande . I think I 'll have to go away somewhere  --  if there 's any place left on earth where you do n't hear endless talk about economic chaos  --  and threats of war  --  ( he moves up L.C. ) and the collapse of civilization  --  and where I wo n't ever have to dress for dinner .

PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF In Russian fashion , madame : boots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dagger in here . ( Pointing to his xschest . ) CHARLES DUPONT Very picturesque . But I hardly think that would be quite the costume for our needs . FERNANDE DUPONT And you ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Also in Russian fashion , madame : short , pleated skirt , flowered blouse , low neck , bare arms , and silver-tipped pins in the hair . CHARLES DUPONT Well , that sounds rather attractive .

I noticed that . I saw the way you looked at her . CHARLES DUPONT What do you mean ? FERNANDE DUPONT She has a very melting expression . Most effective . CHARLES DUPONT ( turning away C. ) .

Russian or Swede or Annanite , I 'm not interested in housemaids , and I do n't at all like the implication that I noticed her looks , melting or otherwise . FERNANDE DUPONT Now , Charles  --  do n't get excited . CHARLES DUPONT ( C. ) . I 'm not excited . I 'm only telling you that I leave servants to the tradesmen . So please do n't insult me by assuming that ( He starts to cross R.C. The door opens up C. and GEORGES and HLNE come in . She crosses down L. and sits on the dressing-table . They are as formal and snobbish as their parents ; devoid of all apparent youthfulness , although she is about eighteen and he twenty . One feels that they have cold , narrow , old little hearts. ) p. 71 GEORGES DUPONT ( sitting in the chair L. of the desk ) Who are those two odd-looking people with Louise ?

FERNANDE DUPONT Is there anything wrong with their appearance ? GEORGES DUPONT He looks more like a waiter than a butler .

FERNANDE DUPONT Perhaps you two superior beings will be interested to know that they worked for six years for Prince Ouratieff H&amp;EACUTE ; L&amp;EGRAVE ; NE DUPONT Prince who ? FERNANDE DUPONT Prince Ouratieff and his wife , the Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna . GEORGES DUPONT Ah ! Then , that accounts for it . FERNANDE DUPONT Accounts for what ? p. 72 GEORGES DUPONT They 're Russians ! ( He laughs . ) FERNANDE DUPONT And what has that to do with it ? H&amp;EACUTE ; L&amp;EGRAVE ; NE DUPONT You 've let yourself be taken in . You probably believed everything they told you . FERNANDE DUPONT They had a most glowing reference from Her Highness . GEORGES DUPONT My dear mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Duchesses  --  or Generals , at the very least ? FERNANDE DUPONT I 'm not listening to a word you say  --  ( she rises and crosses L.C. ) or you either , Hlne . I only want to beg you not to treat these people like dirt under your feet , as you did with Francois and Berthe . They 'd have been with us yet if it had n't been for you . GEORGES DUPONT ( turning his chair to C. ) . Then I 'm very sorry . FERNANDE DUPONT Oh , are you ? GEORGES DUPONT Francois and Berthe were n't much , but at least they were n't foreigners . FERNANDE DUPONT ( crossing C. to GEORGES ) . When you speak to Michel and Tina , please address them by name . Not pssst ! And if you have to make insulting remarks about them , wait until they have left the room . ( Crossing L.C. ) And as for you , Helene p. 73 H&amp;EACUTE ; L&amp;EGRAVE ; NE DUPONT ( calmly ) . Yes , Mother ? FERNANDE DUPONT ( sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a great many duties more important than taking your Pekinese out for a walk every hour . GEORGES DUPONT I see .

But do n't do anything to drive them out of the house before your father and I decide it 's a time for them to go . Will you be dining at home to-night ? H&amp;EACUTE ; L&amp;EGRAVE ; NE DUPONT No . I 'm dining with the Comtesse de Maupendy . There 's to be a rehearsal of that dreary Venetian fete , and she wants me to be one of the musicians .

FERNANDE DUPONT I 've never met this Gorotchenko , but I suppose he 's pretty much of a boor . However , he is our guest and we must do everything we can to put him at his ease . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF He is a most cultivated man , madame , with a very lively wit . A bit malicious , perhaps  --  but keen . It was he who composed that immortal sentence which was engraved on the door of the Loubianka Prison . " Four walls for punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's never done you any personal harm , has he ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( slowly ) . None , sir . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Less than none , sir . CHARLES DUPONT Well , then , we can all forget the past . Gorotchenko is now representing the Soviet oil interests , and oil , as we all know , is most effective in in smoothing out ( MIKAIL helping CHARLES out of his embarrassment . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF He was not always in oil , sir . General Gorotchenko was chief of the Investigating Staff at the Tcheka . At that time , my former master , Prince Ouratieff , had some dealings with him . CHARLES DUPONT Really ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Yes , sir . The conversation between them was n't progressing as smoothly as Gorotchenko wished  --  so  --  to enliven matters  --  he placed the end of his cigarette  --  the lighted end , of course  --  between Prince Ouratieff 's fingers . You 'll find him very interesting , madame . FERNANDE DUPONT How horrible ! GRAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find him very entertaining . When he was Commissar of the Fort of Kronstadt , the Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna was imprisoned there . I 've heard her speak of him often . Women always found him irresistible . p. 116 CHARLES DUPONT You mean he  --  he made ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( levelly ) . Advances  --  yes , sir . FERNANDE DUPONT But he must be an appalling person ! CHARLES DUPONT Nonsense ! Michel and Tina have only heard of him from people with a very prejudiced point of view . FERNANDE DUPONT ( rising ) . But I hope you 're not going to think about these dreadful things when you 're serving the soup ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( soberly ) . Madame , we shall think only that we 're your servants and that we must be worthy of your trust . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And now  --  if madame will excuse us . FERNANDE DUPONT Certainly . You can get the cocktails ready . ( Mikail and TATIANA go out L. CHARLES crosses up R.  --  then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She comes down R. ) CHARLES DUPONT Never ! ( He crosses down L.C. ) p. 117 FERNANDE DUPONT But I wish that Gorotchenko were n't coming . It will be such an ordeal for them . CHARLES DUPONT Nevertheless , we 'll have to be nice to him ( sitting L.C. ) , Fernande , because , whatever outrages he may have committed , he exudes an odour which is very sweet . FERNANDE DUPONT ( fixing flowers ) . Odour ? CHARLES DUPONT Yes . He reeks of petrol  --  those vast , rich , undeveloped Bakoura fields with millions and billions just waiting to be taken out . We must play our cards cleverly to-night . Gorotchenko should sit at your right ; Chauffourier at your left , and at my right that Madame Van Hemert . FERNANDE DUPONT ( crossing C. ) . Is she , too , perfumed with petrol ? CHARLES DUPONT Ah  --  yes . In a more refined form , of course . FERNANDE DUPONT This house will smell like a garage . CHARLES DUPONT Madame Van Hemert represents the Royal-Dutch interests ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If all works out as I hope , we 'll be swimming in petrol  --  liquid gold . There 's a fortune involved , my dear . But of course everything depends on Gorotchenko. p. 118 FERNANDE DUPONT Oh . Charles , should n't you , at least , be wearing a dinner-jacket ? ( She steps C. ) ( A bell is heard . ) CHARLES DUPONT Oh , no ! Chauffourier told me expressly not to dress . You know how the Bolsheviks feel about our bourgeois customs CONCIERGE ( off L. ) . What name , madame ? MADAME VAN HEMERT ( off L. ) . Madame Van Hemert . FERNANDE DUPONT Get up . They 're here . ( CHARLES rises . FERNANDE braces herself . The door opens up L.C. and the CONCIERGE appears . ) CONCIERGE ( announcing ) . MADAME Van Hemert ! ( Madame Van Hemert comes in up L.C. , and crosses down C. She is thin , hard , sharp , rather chic , very elegant . ) FERNANDE DUPONT ( cordially ) . How do you do ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? ( She crosses to FERNANDE , C. ) FERNANDE DUPONT Permit me to present my husband . p. 119 CHARLES DUPONT My dear madame  --  you do us honour . MADAME VAN HEMERT You must forgive me  --  but I 'm invariably the first to arrive . CHARLES DUPONT How charming of you ! FERNANDE DUPONT Do sit down . MADAME VAN HEMERT Thank you . ( She sits L.C. There is an awkward silence . ) FERNANDE DUPONT ( sitting R.C. ) . Have you met Commissar Gorotchenko before ? MADAME VAN HEMERT Oh , yes  --  at Teheran  --  and once or twice in London , and of course in Moscow . CHARLES DUPONT ( L.C. , above her chair ) . You 've travelled far . MADAME VAN HEMERT ( levelly ) . Yes , Monsieur Dupont . I 'm a sort of Vestal Virgin . CHARLES DUPONT Oh ! MADAME VAN HEMERT I am one of those whose duty it is to keep the lamps of the world filled with oil . It necessitates a great deal of travel . FERNANDE DUPONT And a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much diplomacy as  --  relentlessness . CHARLES DUPONT You Hollanders are a remarkable people . MADAME VAN HEMERT We 've had to be . FERNANDE DUPONT And Gorotchenko  --  what is he like ? I confess I 'm a little nervous . MADAME VAN HEMERT Do n't worry , madame . He can be agreeable enough when he 's in the right mood . CHARLES DUPONT And when he 's in the wrong mood ? MADAME VAN HEMERT He has the grace to keep ominously quiet . ( The door up L.C. opens and TATIANA comes in . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( coming down C. ) . Excuse me , madame . FERNANDE DUPONT Yes , Tina ? MADAME VAN HEMERT ( rising ) . Oh ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Shall we serve the cocktails ? MADAME VAN HEMERT Her Imperial Highness . ( She sinks in the deep ceremonial curtsy . ) ( FERNANDE rises and backs down R. ) p. 121 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( backing away up L. ) . No-no ! Please do n't do that please do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEMERT follows to C. ) FERNANDE DUPONT What on earth ? CHARLES DUPONT I beg your pardon , madame , but just why did you do that ? MADAME VAN HEMERT Why is she here ? CHARLES DUPONT That 's our housemaid . She 's a Russian . FERNANDE DUPONT We have two of them  --  man and wife . MADAME VAN HEMERT Your servant ! CHARLES DUPONT Why , yes , her name is Tina . MADAME VAN HEMERT Tina ! That is the former Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna . FERNANDE DUPONT The CHARLES DUPONT No-no FERNANDE DUPONT You 're mistaken . CHARLES DUPONT She was employed by the Grand Duchess . MADAME VAN HEMERT She is the Grand Duchess ! ( She turns to FERNANDE . ) I knew her well in Petersburg . p. 122 FERNANDE DUPONT I tell you  --  that 's our housemaid . There may be a resemblance . ( Madame Van Hemert laughs heartily . FERNANDE and CHARLES look at each other with mounting horror . ) MADAME VAN HEMERT Forgive me  --  I should n't be laughing  --  but  --  I really ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference from the Grand Duchess . ( There is a pause . ) CHARLES DUPONT You know , she might have written it herself ! MADAME VAN HEMERT ( laughing ) . And is her husband , Prince Ouratieff , here too ? CHARLES DUPONT ( looking at MADAME VAN HEMERT ) . Prince Ouratieff ! Great God ! I suppose that 's Michel . ( He crosses to the door up L.C. ) FERNANDE DUPONT Are you sure about this ? MADAME VAN HEMERT I promise you , Madame Dupont , I could n't possibly be mistaken . ( She sits R.C. ) How long have they been with you ? FERNANDE DUPONT Two months . They 've made fools of us ! Do you realize what it will mean ? p. 123 CHARLES DUPONT Realize ! Twenty years from now all Paris will still be laughing at us . ( He crosses up R.C. ) ( The CONCIERGE comes in up L.C. ) CONCIERGE Monsieur and Madame Chauffourier-Dubieff . ( They come in up L.C. General greetings . FERNANDE crosses C. and shakes hands with CHAUFFOURIER . ) MADAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good evening , Fernande . FERNANDE DUPONT Good evening , my dear . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF It 's turning rather cold . ( CHARLES crosses C. MADAME CHAUFFOURIER crosses L.C. with FERNANDE , and sits on the downstage end of the settee . ) FERNANDE DUPONT Really ? It 's been quite warm indoors . MADAME CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF There 's a north wind that feels like Siberia CHARLES DUPONT ( crossing R.C.  --  shivers ) . I hate the sound of that word . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( L. of MADAME VAN HEMERT ; to her ) . Well , madame , you seem very gay this evening ! Good news from the East Indies ? ( MIKAIL comes in L. and crosses to L.C. ) Why , bless my soul ! ( He turns C. ) What a delightful surprise ! ( He shakes hands with MIKAIL . ) I had no idea Your Excellency was to be here . p. 124 FERNANDE DUPONT ( to CHARLES ) . Excellency ? ( She sits on the upstage end of the settee . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF But you 're wearing evening clothes . That 's an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( trying to escape ) . If you will ( He turns L. ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( stopping him ) . You 're dining here with us ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Sir , I am dining here  --  but not at the same time . ( To FERNANDE . ) May I serve the cocktails , madame ? FERNANDE DUPONT Yes . You may serve the cocktails . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Thank you , madame . ( He goes out L. ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( wondering ) . It is a joke , is n't it ? ( He is C. ) MADAME VAN HEMERT ( laughing ) . The best joke for years . MADAME CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Are you going to explain it now  --  or must we wait ? p. 125 CHARLES DUPONT ( crossing R.C. ) . It makes no difference when we explain it . To-morrow  --  it will be in every newspaper . FERNANDE DUPONT ( rising ) . And Gorotchenko ! Why , they 'll be at each other 's throats ! ( Imploringly to her guests . ) I 'm terribly sorry  --  ( she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we dine at a restaurant ? MADAME VAN HEMERT Not at all . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF But why ? With Prince Ouratieff on hand , the situation is ideal . We might persuade him to join the combine . He might agree to finance the whole scheme . CHARLES DUPONT Him  --  finance us ? ( He steps to CHAUFFOURIER . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Why not ? As a Russian , he 'd appreciate the value of the oil concession . CHARLES DUPONT But  --  forgive me , Governor  --  I 'm a little bewildered . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF You evidently do n't know that Ouratieff is probably the only man living who can write his cheque on the Bank of France for four billion francs  --  CHARLES DUPONT Four billion p. 126 CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF Yes  --  and have it honoured . ( FERNANDE sits R. of MADAME CHAUFFOURIER . ) So  --  when you 've finished your little joke , whatever it is ( he turns L. and bows to the ladies ) , we 'd better sit down with His Excellency and talk business . CHARLES DUPONT Yes . ( CHAUFFOURIER , crossing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts it R. of R.C. table . ) CONCIERGE ( entering and announcing ) . Commissar Gorotchenko . ( FERNANDE rises . GOROTCHENKO comes in up L.C. He is strongly built , with a humorous , saturnine expression  --  a civilized barbarian with keen perceptivity and a great appreciation of life . He is wearing a tail coat and white tie . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( crossing down L.C. to FERNANDE ) . My respects , madame . And Monsieur Dupont , I believe . ( He crosses to CHARLES , L. of the table R.C. ) CHARLES DUPONT Yes  --  er  --  how do you do , Commissar ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Very well , thank you . And my dear Madame Van Hemert p. 127 MADAME VAN HEMERT ( rising ) . My dear Commissar . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Madame Chauffourier  --  ( he crosses down R.C. ) my dear Governor CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF My dear Commissar . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO A most distinguished gathering ! ( He turns C. ) I am already ill at ease . MADAME VAN HEMERT ( crossing L.C. with CHARLES ) . You 'll know how distinguished it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She sits L.C. ) ( FERNANDE sits on the upstage end of the settee . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Then , there are other guests ? Thank heaven , I 'm not the last . ( CHARLES motions GOROTCHENKO to sit R.C. ) CHARLES DUPONT ( above the chair L.C. ) . There are others  --  yes  --  but not exactly guests . ( Mikail enters L. with cocktails and crosses down L. , serves MADAME VAN HEMERT , then MADAME CHAUFFOURIER , then FERNANDE . He goes to serve CHARLES , who goes to take one , thinks better of it , refuses. ) p. 128 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( to CHAUFFOURIER , as MIKAIL goes to CHARLES ) . And how is the new State loan progressing , my dear Governor ? CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF I 'm rather sorry you mentioned that , Commissar . But we are always optimistic . ( He indicates MIKAIL . ) ( Mikail crosses to CHAUFFOURIER . Cue for TATIANA 'S entrance with sandwiches L. She serves them in the same order as MIKAIL . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( to MIKAIL ) . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He sees TATIANA , breaks off , then : ) Your very good health , madame . FERNANDE DUPONT Thank you . ( MIKAIL has served CHAUFFOURIER . He takes the tray up C. to the table , then stands at attention . There is a long pause . ) CHARLES DUPONT ( as TATIANA reaches MADAME CHAUFFOURIER ) . Ah  --  Madame Chauffourier tells us that it has turned quite cold . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I suppose it has . Though it seems comparatively xstropical to us Russians . ( TATIANA serves him . ) Thank you . p. 129 MADAME VAN HEMERT ( when TATIANA serves CHAUFFOURIER ) . I was in Moscow once when it was positively hot . FERNANDE DUPONT Really ? MADAME VAN HEMERT Oh , yes there were thousands of people bathing in the river , all stark-naked . CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF H 'm ? CHARLES DUPONT How amusing ! ( TATIANA crosses up C. to R. of MIKAIL . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO We make them wear bathing-suits now . Oh , yes  --  we 've turned very moral . MADAME CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF But I 'm eternally sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOROTCHENKO Yes , I must confess  --  there are some aspects of the old rgime that we miss in the Soviet Union . ( He takes out a cigarette . MIKAIL steps down with matches . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Permit me , Commissar . ( He lights GOROTCHENKO 'S cigarette , then exits L. ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Thank you . But what a charming room this is , madame . Is n't it a replica of the Hotel de Landuzy ? p. 130 FERNANDE DUPONT Why , yes  --  it is . Did you know the Hotel de Landuzy ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I am an old Parisian , madame . For three years I was a dish-washer in the Quai de Bourbon . FERNANDE DUPONT A dish-washer ! How very interesting . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Yes  --  literally . I washed dishes . That was when I was studying for my philosophical degree . CHARLES DUPONT In addition to everything else , you 're a Doctor of Philosophy ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO That was a long time ago , Monsieur Dupont . I 'm afraid I 've forgotten most of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've passed on from pure theory to impure fact . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( laughing ) . That 's it , my dear Governor . I was captivated by Plato 's concept of the Perfect State . Where every man has the brain of Socrates in the body of Adonis , and every woman  --  but I 'm sure you ladies have already achieved the Platonic ideal . MADAME VAN HEMERT ( to FERNANDE ) . He 's poisonous , is n't he ? He 'll make communists of us all . p. 131 CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF You 've explained a great deal , Commissar . You learned about the Perfect State and then went home to Russia and built it . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO No  --  when I returned to Russia , I was careful to leave my idealism behind . That was a bad time for idealists , you know . A few of them escaped into Finland , but the majority were submerged in rivers of blood . MADAME CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF How shocking ! CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF And how necessary ! That 's the one point on which Capitalism and Communism agree : the idealists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realist . You know , Plato himself likened all of us to prisoners , chained in a cave . Behind us , a fire is burning  --  and we 're forced to contemplate our own shadows , magnified horribly on the wall . We 're terrified of them . They awaken in us race memories , and we shrink from them as though they were prehistoric monsters . It 's the duty of the philosopher to break the chains , and escape from the cave into the world of clear reality . And that is what we have tried to do in the Soviet Union . You may feel that we have failed . But , in any case , we have provided a fascinating chapter of history for the dish-washers of the future . ( MADAME CHAUFFOURIER gives a nervous little laugh . ) But I 'm afraid I 've become much too talkative , madame . Do forgive me . It 's a Russian failing . p. 132 CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF No  --  Commissar . I 'm sure we 've all greatly enjoyed your  --  little lecture . ( Enter MIKAIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dinner is served , madame . ( He crosses to the doors L. and stands above them . ) CHARLES DUPONT ( relieved ) . Ah  --  dinner ! FERNANDE DUPONT Shall we go in ? MADAME VAN HEMERT By all means . ( To GOROTCHENKO . ) We will discuss Plato  --  and Petrol . ( All rise . ) FERNANDE DUPONT ( seeing CHARLES is standing dazed ) . Charles ! ( Charles crosses down , takes MADAME CHAUFFOURIER 'S arm and crosses L. He exits . ) CHAUFFOURIER-DUBIEFF ( crossing C. and taking MADAME VAN HEMERT 'S arm ) . That 's what we bankers have needed in the past years  --  some lessons in philosophy . May I have the honour ? ( He exits L. with MADAME VAN HEMERT. ) p. 133 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( crossing to FERNANDE , who is L.C. ) . You know  --  it 's a very bad thing for a communist to dine in a French house . A shamefully corrupting influence ! ( Both cross L. ) FERNANDE DUPONT You 're in a good mood , Commissar . COMMISSAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged to enjoy such charming company . ( GOROTCHENKO and FERNANDE exit L. ) MADAME VAN HEMERT ( off ) . Ah , we 're charming now , Commissar . But wait until we get down to business . ( The voices of the guests die away . MIKAIL crosses to TATIANA , puts his arm around her . Then he crosses to the doors L. and stands at attention . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF After you , Highness . ( TATIANA crosses and exits with her head held high . MIKAIL follows her. ) @x Scene .  --  The kitchen of the DUPONTS ' house . Three hours later than Act II . ( See Photograph of Scene . ) MIKAIL , TATIANA and LOUISE are seated at the table , having finished their dinner . TATIANA is holding out her coffee-glass . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( seated at R. upstage end of the table ) . Some more coffee , please . LOUISE ( seated at R. end of the table ) . That 's three glasses for you . You know , you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Louise . I shall not sleep . LOUISE ( smiling ) . What 's the matter , my dears ? Did n't the dinner go off well ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( seated at L. upstage end of the table  --  vaguely ) . Oh  --  yes  --  it went off well . LOUISE They did n't eat much . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF No there seemed to be a general loss of appetite . Except for Gorotchenko . He ate a great deal of everything . A masterly display of imperviousness to embarrassment . p. 135 LOUISE Gorotchenko ? What 's he  --  another Russian ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF He was born a Russian . LOUISE It must be nice for you to see one of your own people . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA What did you say ? LOUISE I said  --  it must be nice for you to see one of your own people . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Mikail ! Make her be quiet . LOUISE Mother of God ! What 's wrong with her ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Forgive us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOUISE But why  --  what is it ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Simply this , Louise . The time has come for us to set out for new fields of endeavour . LOUISE And what do you mean by that ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I mean that we have been fired . LOUISE When ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF To-night . After dinner . Madame informed us ever so elegantly , that the usual notice would be dispensed with . We receive our wages and depart in the morning . p. 136 LOUISE Well , all I can say is , I 'm very , very sorry . We 've got along well together , the three of us . ( TATIANA rises , crosses up R. , puts on her apron , then goes to the sink . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Well , it has to happen to all of us sooner or later . Dismissal and death . Well , at least I shall serve the lemonade in the drawing-room at eleven o'clock as I was ordered . They shall not deprive me of that privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what she 's complaining about . I 'd say you two have done more than enough ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And you have been very kind to us . You will always be remembered by Her Highness and me with loving gratitude . LOUISE Her Highness , eh ! ( She laughs . ) Is that one of your Russian jokes ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF No , Louise . That one was grimly serious . ( TATIANA crosses down to the table . ) LOUISE ( to TATIANA ) . Are you a Highness ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Imperial ! ( She starts to collect plates , etc. , off the table. ) p. 137 LOUISE And what does that make you , Michel ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF No more than her consort , Louise . A paltry prince . It must be something of a shock to you to learn the kind of people who have been your associates and friends . ( He rises , crosses up R. and puts on his apron . ) LOUISE Oh , no . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the refrigerator . ) Princes and Highnesses have to live somewhere , like other people . They may as well live here as anywhere else . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( clearing the table ) . Godly woman ! You understand things . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF If only you could convey some of your liberality to our employers . LOUISE So that 's why they 're sending you away , eh ? Because you deceived them into thinking you 're common  --  like they are . ( She gets milk-bottles from the floor above the refrigerator and puts them on the cupboard  --  extreme L. end . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( with emotion ) . Yes ! But it is n't the first time we 've had to suffer for the misfortune of exalted birth . ( He hands TATIANA another dish . She inspects it and thrusts it back at him. ) p. 138 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Wash it again ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Is n't it clean ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( pointing to a blemish ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . I thought it was part of the design . ( Louise laughs and takes a napkin from the cupboard in the refrigerator . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA If Madame Dupont caught you being as careless as that ( Pause . ) Oh ! for the moment I 'd forgotten . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( his right arm round TATIANA ) . My sainted love . There is no tragedy great enough to break your magnificent spirit  --  is there ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( working hard ) . Go on with the dishes . LOUISE ( taking a pitcher of lemonade from the refrigerator , putting it on the tray on top of the refrigerator and convering all with the napkin ) . What will you do now ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( washing plates , puts them on the rack R. of the sink ) . Starve  --  with quiet dignity . p. 139 LOUISE Why do n't you just get rid of those silly titles ? ( She gets a string bag from the L. cupboard and comes down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETROVNA ROMANOVA By the blessed St. Christopher ! If I dropped dead this instant , I 'd still be a Grand Duchess . My soul would be flapping about in heaven with wings a lot longer than the other angels . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And you 'd still be flying into trouble . LOUISE Do n't you want to leave ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( together ) . No ! No ! Never . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( together ) . No ! No ! Never . LOUISE Then , do n't . ( She puts an apple in the bag . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF But what can we do ? Chain ourselves to the sink ? LOUISE Why do n't you join the Union ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF What union ? ( He crosses to above the table C. ) LOUISE Of domestic workers . Or do n't you want to go on doing this kind of work ? p. 140 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF We never want to do anything else . We 're not fitted for anything else . GRAND DUCHESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( She crosses to the R. end of the table . ) LOUISE It will protect you from this very thing  --  I mean , being dismissed for no good reason . Now listen  --  if your employers say or do anything you do n't like , you 'll only have to go to the Union and lodge a protest . And then the Union will send an official round to the house  --  and those officials use the front door , not the back door , believe me  --  and he 'll say a few things to Monsieur and Madame  --  and the next thing you know , they 'll be apologizing to you , and raising your wages , and putting a radio in your room . ( She takes off her apron , hangs it on the hook L. , then puts on a shawl . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF But that  --  that sounds like Bolshevism . ( He crosses back to the sink . ) LOUISE Call it anything you please , Michel . ( She crosses back to the table for the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes of us . Can I help you with any of that work ? p. 141 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( pushing chairs in ) . No , thanks , darling . We want to do all of it , ourselves . It 's our last chance . LOUISE Well  --  good night , my dears . And good luck . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Good night , Louise . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing to her and giving her a kiss ) . Good night , daughter of God . ( LOUISE lumbers out L. ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Hideous china , is n't it ? And yet  --  I love it . I shall miss it very , very sorely . ( They are back at the sink , washing . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Do you realize that in two months  --  nearly nine weeks  --  we have n't broken any of it ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Not so much as a chip . ( With a deep sigh . ) Never in all our lives before have we ever done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TATIANA is drying plates . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA God must know that we 've been good servants ? Surely , he 'll find us another place . p. 142 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF It 's useless . Wherever we go  --  here in France  --  they 'll know all about us . How much money have we ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA I have eleven francs . I spent all the rest on that dress for to-night . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I have two thousand . Two thousand and fifty  --  GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Eh ! ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF From Monsieur Georges . What a miserable poker player he is . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA He 's in love ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I know GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA With me . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Yes  --  and so am I. But I do n't allow it to interfere with my technique at poker . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Is two thousand francs enough to take us to South America ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETROVNA ROMANOVA That 's where people seem to go , when they 're desperate . What language do they speak there ? p. 143 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Spanish  --  or Portuguese  --  or something . There was a South American gigolo at the Kasbek once . He did n't speak much of anything . He just murmured . ( TATIANA has gone to R. of the table to clear off the remains of their meal . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Poor little coffee-pot . Forlorn  --  and empty . Like our lives . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( crossing down to R. of her ) . Ah  --  my darling ! How can we go to that party , with these two young monkeys ? How can we pretend to be gay when we 've lost bread and bed and central heating ? ( TATIANA crosses up , puts the pot on the sink , gets a broom from up R.C. , and sweeps below the table C. ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Oh , we 've promised , Mikail . The Grand Duke Alexei would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give this party . And everyone else there will have no more reason for rejoicing than we have . And then poor little Monsieur Georges . He has been very good to us . ( She is sweeping down L.C. ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF The amorous puppy ! p. 144 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA And Mademoiselle Hlne  --  she 's been good to us , too  --  and  --  ( with a malicious smile ) for the same reason  --  we must n't disappoint them . ( Mikail crosses to L. of the table , sits on the end and puts his feet up on the chair . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Very well , Tatiana  --  we 'll go . We 'll make the last gruesome pretence . ( TATIANA puts her arms about him . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA My poor , tragic pigeon . You were n't nearly so depressed when they burned down our palace at Orlovskai  --  and destroyed all your beautiful horses in the stable and the Rembrandts in the library . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF That was in Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed when they arrested us , and put us in prison , and we were so certain we were going to die PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF That , too , was in Russia , Tatiana . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Well  --  and where are we now ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF In the kitchen of a French banker named Dupont. p. 145 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA No ! It 's our kitchen , Mikail . Breathe the air , my darling . It smells of onions and coal-gas and brown soap  --  but when you breathe it in , it becomes the air of Russia  --  cold and clean . Wherever we may go , it will be the same . In our lungs , and our eyes , and our hearts will be Russia . ( Clinging to him . ) Mishenka  --  PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Tanouska . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( with joyful energy ) . Nitchevo ! ( MIKAIL lets himself be won over . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Nitchevo ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( repeating it louder ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , Tatiana . Nitchevo ! ( TATIANA laughs with a full-throated laugh . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Nitchevo  --  nitchevo  --  nitchevo  --  ( Mikail is restored to gaiety with a good laugh . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Nitchevo  --  nitchevo  --  nitchevo  --  ( TATIANA kisses MIKAIL . MIKAIL crosses up R. , takes off his apron , and hangs it up . He puts on his coat. ) p. 146 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( quite simply ) . Go and put away monsieur 's clothes . I will finish the washing-up . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Very well , Tina . ( TATIANA is sweeping L. of the table . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA And  --  to-night I 'll have a talk with Kokovstev . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Why Kokovstev ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA He works for one of those travel bureaux . He 'll be able to tell us how much it costs to go to South America . And what language they speak . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Perhaps they all just murmur . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crosses to the window and pulls up the blind . She sees the church , crosses herself ; she then wipes the table with the cloth , then puts a cloth on the table . Then she puts knives and forks on the cloth , then covers them with another cloth : gets a dust-pan and brush , and kneels L. of the table . The door opens and GOROTCHENKO appears R. ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO May I come in ? ( TATIANA rises sharply. ) p. 147 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Oh ! ( Crossing to R.C. above the table ) . What have you come here for ? The silver ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( smiling ) . I came to see His Excellency , your xshusband . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA The butler ? He has work to do  --  important work . ( She puts the dust-pan and brush under the table up R. ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( coming in and crossing below the table to L.C. ) . Then , perhaps I may wait for him . ( He looks around . ) You keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( turning on him again ) . Who gave you permission to come in here ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( taking a step to the table ) . No one , madame . I just walked in through the dining-room . The others are in the drawing-room , muttering prayers to the great god Petrol . They have some sort of agreement they want me to sign . But I  --  I asked for time to think it over in solitude . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA In the kitchen ? p. 148 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO They think I 'm in the study . But they 're too tactful to disturb me . People in oil are always tactful . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Why do you want to do your thinking here ? Will it help you to see how I wash the dishes ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( taking a step up C. ) I 'm sure you do it with flawless grace . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( polishing a plate by the sink ) . You should know . I was given many lessons in dish-washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO That was a rigorous school , madame . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes . Those who broke dishes were shot . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Dishes were difficult to replace in those days . We have our own factories now . We can affored to be a little more lenient . ( He sits down L. of the table . ) Do you mind if I smoke ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA No  --  Commissar . I do n't mind . As long as you remain sitting down . ( She shoves an ashtray towards him . ) ( GOROTCHENKO lights a cigarette which he takes from his case . ) Have you forgotten our last encounter ? ( She is looking levelly at him . ) You were sitting behind your enormous desk , smoking a cigarette , just as you are now . Then you stood up , and walked around the desk , put down your cigarette and took hold of my wrist . p. 149 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I see no reason to refer to that , madame . It was something that happened in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Oh  --  I hold no grudge , Gorotchenko . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I 'm sure you do n't . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA But I 'd like to have you know that when I get back , I shall have your eyes burned out and the sockets filled with Siberian salt . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO If you do come back , madame , the most horrible retribution you can think of will be no more than I deserve , because I was guilty of the most unpardonable of crimes . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA It does me no good to hear you admit it . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I was guilty of sentimentality . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( laughing ) . Sentimentality ! That 's a rather quaint way of describing it , Commissar . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I was referring to the moment of weaknes when I permitted you to go off in that motor-boat , through the darkness . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA You knew that the motor-boat was there ? p. 150 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Yes , madame The man who took you was shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Finland . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA You killed that godly man ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Somebody had to be punished for your escape . Had it not been he , it would have been the Governor of the prison . The revolution was young then  --  and I was not quite ready to die . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Why did you let me go ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO There was something in you that impelled me to neglect my obvious duty . I suppose that something can best be described as gallantry And furthermore  --  I could not rid myself of the belief that your usefulness to Russia had not ended . ( She looks at him for a moment , then turns away , and goes up to the sink . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Please leave me to do my work in peace  --  and go back and drink brandy with the bourgeoisie . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Go on with your work , madame . I shall wait here for your husband , if you 'll allow me . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall still wait  --  though not comfortably . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( taking a step down to him ) . After I have your eyes burned out , Gorotchenko , I 'll make you crawl on your hands and knees out of St. Petersburg . ( She is polishing a plate . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( softly ) . Leningrad . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA From St. Petersburg to Moscow . You 'll have a horse 's carcass tied around your neck to chew on when you 're hungry . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( smiling ) . I shall be at your command , madame . I wonder if I could help you with your work  --  ( He rises and crosses to above the table . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Do n't you dare to touch  --  ( She backs to the sink . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I was a good dish-washer once . ( He crosses to the sink , L. of her , and picks up a plate . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA This is not the Quai de Bourbon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plate from him . ) ( MIKAIL enters R. with shoes . TATIANA crosses to L. of MIKAIL. ) p. 152 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( seeing him ) . And what are you doing in our kitchen ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( taking a step to L. of the table ) . I explained to madame that I 'm deep in thought . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( putting shoes on the dresser R. ) Take your evil thoughts elsewhere . They pollute the atmosphere . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( stepping to MIKAIL ) . Pick him up with the coal-tongs , Mikail , and throw him out . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO No  --  I should consider that inhospitable in the extreme . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Monsieur and Madame Dupont invited you here for reasons best known to themselves , you can therefore expect hospitality in the drawing-room ; here in the kitchen we 're more particular in the selection of our guests . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO As you should be , General . But it is my recollection that once Madame was a Grand Duchess of Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage ) . I am always a Grand Duchess . p. 153 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Exactly . And I 'm sure you have n't forgotten that in any house which is graced with your presence  --  it makes no difference who owns the place or who pays the rent , etiquette decrees that you are the hostess . I am therefore , madame , your guest . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( stepping to MIKAIL ) . The dog is right , Mikail . Sit down ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Very well . You may remain ( he starts to put on his apron ) and derive what enjoyment you can from the spectacle of your former commanding officer cleaning his master 's boots . ( He starts work . ) ( TATIANA crosses back to the sink . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( sitting L. of the table ) . I did not come here for enjoyment . General Prince Ouratieff , I should like to ask you a question . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Another interrogation , Commissar ? Remember I am now under the benevolent protection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory as a cavalry general of the guard , aide-de-camp to Nicholas Romanoff ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( taking duster and boot-brush from the dresser R. ) . My last memory ? I 'm afraid I 've forgotten it . ( TATIANA takes silver from the table to the sink. ) p. 154 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I 've always regretted that I was not with you in your last battle , General . It must have been a splendid sight . You see , I had a very real admiration for you . You were always an object of awe and envy to me , when we were together in the Cavaler Gardsky regiment . Probably you have forgotten those days , but they remain all too clear in my memory . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I have not forgotten those days , Gorotchenko . You were thoroughly objectionable even then . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Yes , I was . I was too conscious of inferiority . That was what made me drink too much vodka at the regimental banquet in the presence of the Tsar . A grievous offence  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems strange now , does n't it ?  --  to think that if I had n't been so nervous that night , and drunk too much vodka so quickly  --  I should never have gone to Paris , to study philosophy , and to read the writings of Karl Marx . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Commissar , I can not speak for my beloved wife , but for myself I can say that I find the story of your life profoundly and appallingly dull . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Speak for me too , my pigeon . ( She steps in , then back again. ) p. 155 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF My wife too . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO You surprise me , General . I have found my life most exciting  --  sometimes excessively so . The present moment , for instance , is fraught with possibilities . ( TATIANA is at the sink , MIKAIL polishing shoes . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( hitting a shoe with the brush ) . Such as  --  that I might forget myself long enough to do you some bodily injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm busy ! COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I am not thinking of the situation that prevails here in the kitchen  --  but of that other one which awaits me in the bourgeois drawing-room . ( He says this in such a way that both look at him , curiously . ) General Prince Ouratieff  --  I want you to do me a slight favour . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Yes , Commissar . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO When I say slight  --  I mean it will cost you very little in the way of effort , and nothing in the way of money . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You have only to ask a favour , Commissar , and it will be refused . p. 156 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I want you to write me a cheque for four billion francs . ( MIKAIL stops polishing . There is a considerable , pregnant silence . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Is that why you came into our kitchen , for a mere matter of four billion francs ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Yes , madame . It is why I suggested that this meeting be held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I signed their agreement . ( MIKAIL puts the boot-brush and duster in the drawer of the dresser , then puts the shoes under the table up R. ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF How did you know we were here ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I have been careful not to lose sight of you , General . You may remember that just before you took this place , you had an interview with one of my agents  --  a stupid , violent little girl . ( MIKAIL takes off his apron and puts on his coat . ) You sent me a message , through her , urging me to call on you in person . I have done so . ( TATIANA has finished drying silver and now has a plate . Note .  --  This is the trick plate , to be broken . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF We acknowledge the visit , Commissar . And now it is time to take in the lemonade . ( He crosses to the sink to wash his hands. ) p. 157 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( rising and crossing to MIKAIL ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take a moment . ( MIKAIL looks at him over his shoulder by way of answer . ) General Ouratieff  --  ( a step R.C. ) for two hours I have been closeted in there with Chauffourier-Dubieff of the Bank of France , and Madame Van Hemert , whose name is Royal Dutch Oil , and Dupont , who represents United Petrol . Can you imagine why they are so cordial to me , a despised Bolshevik ? They want me to sign the transfer of the Bakoura and Petropolsk oil-fields for the next fifty years . ( MIKAIL has been washing his hands and listening without much interest . He now dries them . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And will you sign ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I 've been fighting to avoid it . For it would mean fifty years of English , Dutch , French and Americans  --  digging Russian soil , capitalizing Russian resources , drawing life-blood from the veins of our country . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( calmly ) . Keep up the fight , Commissar . Do n't sign . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General . For I have been commissioned to find credits in gold for the Soviets of the Ukraine and the Ural , for the manufacture of tractors . If I do n't find that money , and at once , some five million wretched peasants will starve to death  --  ( crossing down L.C. ) without mentioning those we shall have to shoot so that they wo n't make a fuss about it . When I asked you for your last memory as a general , I wanted to remind you , that more than the sword can be wielded on behalf of Russia . There is another weapon  --  money . p. 158 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( crossing to above the table C. ) . I have no money . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO You have four billion francs . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF That is not mine . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO It was given to you , unconditionally , by Nicholas Romanoff . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing to R. of the table with the cloth and a plate ) . It was given him by the Tsar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madame . That was in nineteen-seventeen , but now PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF You need n't continue , Gorotchenko . I have refused that money to all the scavengers who have tried to take it from me . And I was not saving it for you . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I know , General . I know all about the offer of Count Brekenski to equip an army of Latvians and Lithuanians to invade the Soviet Union . That would have been a tragic farce . But it is not a farce to give Bakoura and Petropolsk into the hands of foreigners . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Do n't worry , Gorotchenko . ( TATIANA sits R. of the table . ) When the time comes , we shall take them back again . p. 159 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Whom did you say these people are  --  who want you to sign ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO It is a combination of interests , madame  --  French , Dutch , American , English . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I do n't care who they are ! I have held on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . I have even denied it to myself . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO No one has questioned your integrity , Prince Ouratieff . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF And do n't think you can flatter it out of me . ( He crosses up to the sink . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I should not so far insult your intelligence . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( crossing back to the table ) . You would n't hesitate to do anything , Gorotchenko . Once you even tried to torture me . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I know , General . My conduct was then both unworthy and unwise . But now our relative positions are very different . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Nothing is different . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Very well , General . But  --  I wish I could take you now into the Tsar 's room at Tsarskoe Selo. p. 160 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( seated R. of the table ) . It is still there ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Intact , madame . Largely through my own efforts , if I may say so . It has been preserved precisely as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Yes , madame . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA In a white dress , with a high collar and ruffles ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Yes , madame . And  --  it pains me to say it  --  you now have a moustache . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Oh ! COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Supplied by a barbarous visitor . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Oh ! COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO He was condemned to ten years penal servitude . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA For lese-majeste ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO For  --  damaging the workers ' property . ( He turns to MIKAIL . ) Do you remember in that room , on the wall , behind the Tsar 's desk , a big map of all the Russians ? p. 161 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Yes . I remember the map . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO At the bottom of it , to the right , are marked Bakoura and Petropolsk . Of all the undeveloped oil-fields on earth  --  they are the richest . If I sign that agreement with the foreigners  --  a part of that map will have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOROTCHENKO ) . Then , do n't sign ! COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO The peasants must have tractors . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( resisting desperately ) . But not from me . I received that money from the Tsar . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO And who was the Tsar , General ? PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF He was beyond your degraded comprehension . ( He crosses up . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( to TATIANA ) . I ask it of you , madame . Who was the Tsar ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( rising ) . He was Russia ! COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( gravely ) . Yes  --  he was Russia . And therefore  --  he is not dead . p. 162 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( turning down R.C. and speaking suddenly to TATIANA ) . I can tell you  --  the day will come when we can strike back . And  --  on that day  --  no foreigner will be allowed to remain in possession of one square centimetre of our soil . ( He crosses to above the dresser . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( crossing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wrong . We may take back that which belongs to France , or to America . But no one has ever taken back anything from England . ( MIKAIL stares at her . Then he goes close to her . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Tatiana , you want me to sign ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Yes , Mikail ( She drops the plate , which breaks . ) Look , I 've broken a plate . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF The first one . ( Both stoop to pick up the pieces . ) ( He turns to GOROTCHENKO as he puts the pieces on the dresser . ) You may tell Chauffourier and the others that Bakoura and Petropolsk are no longer for sale . ( GOROTCHENKO betrays no emotion whatever. ) p. 163 COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( crossing down R. ) . I shall deliver your message , General . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( leaning against the sink ) . Wait ! You 're forgetting your four billion francs . Where are the pen and ink , darling ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions ! COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO The cheque can wait , General . We can meet again to-morrow . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( dropping down to the table C. ) . We may meet again , Commissar . God arranges many improbable encounters . But I doubt that it will be so soon as to-morrow ( He sits above the table , in the L. chair . He takes a cheque-book from a drawer . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Here they are ( She brings the pen and ink from the cupboard and puts them on the table . ) PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Why does she keep them with the onions ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA The eggs are in the same cupboard , and she likes to mark the date on each egg . p. 164 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( sniffing the pen ) . It stinks . ( TATIANA touches his shoulder . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Darling  --  PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( looking at TATIANA ) . You loved him , did n't you ? ( TATIANA nods , and moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods . ) He would n't have let Bakoura and Petropolsk go , would he ? Even at the cost of his throne  --  his life ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA No ! He would n't have let them go . Never ! PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF Then I am doing right ? ( GOROTCHENKO turns and looks out of the window . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA From the depths of his grave , he sees you , and says that you are fulfilling his trust . From the very height of the skies he is reaching down , to guide your hand . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF But my darling you 're crying . Tatiana ! Why are you crying ? GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( turning away L.C. ) . It is the onions . I swear it is . They always make me cry . p. 165 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF It 's all we have left of what he gave us GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA We have the sword , and the flag , and the ikon , Mikail  --  and ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my sovereign . I can keep for the Tsar that which was the Tsar 's . ( He starts to write . ) January Twelfth . ( He turns to GOROTCHENKO . ) What is your Christian name ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( crossing down to the table , R. of MIKAIL ) . Dmitri . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF ( writing ) . Dmitri Gorotchenko one of the most heartless , soulless , ruthless blackguards that ever desecrated the God-formed surface of this earth . I have made this out " Balance of Account " now I must sign . Mikail Alexandrovitch Ouratieff . ( MIKAIL tears out the cheque . ) The first cheque and the last  --  I have no more use for this . ( He rises , crosses up to the stove , L.C. , drops the book in , then crosses down L. of TATIANA and gives her the cheque. ) p. 166 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( going to GOROTCHENKO at the table ) . To whom will this cheque be given ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO It will be deposited in Paris to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROMANOVA ( imperiously ) . You will inform the Soviet Government that it is tendered in the name of the Tsar . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Your husband 's signature itself will carry that message . ( She looks at MIKAIL , who nods " Yes . " ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( dropping the cheque on the table ) . Then  --  that is understood . ( She turns away and joins MIKAIL up L.C. ) ( GOROTCHENKO picks it up . He folds it and puts it in his pocket . He crosses to the R. of the table , then faces them . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Tatiana Petrovna Romanova ( He turns to MIKAIL . ) Mikail Alexandrovitch Ouratieff the flag of the Romanoffs no longer flies over Soviet territories . But I shall arrange with the Central Committee that it shall be affixed twice into the map in the room that once was the Tsar 's . It shall mark the spot that is Bakoura and the spot that is Petropolsk. p. 167 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA And those flags will be protected from vandals ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at MIKAIL . ) I know you have scant respect for my honour  --  but such as it is , it is dedicated to the fulfilment of this promise . And , by way of thanks , I can only say PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF By way of thanks , you can say nothing , Commissar . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO If either of you should wish to return to Russia GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA The only Russia we will ever know is in our hearts . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I think I understand , madame . I can be sure it 's well guarded . PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF I 'm not so sure that you do understand , Commissar . You and your comrades are just a little too smug  --  too snobbish  --  to understand . We are the Russia of yesterday . You are the Russia of to-day . But I seriously suspect that none of us will have a logical place in the Russia of to-morrow . And now I 'm late with the lemonade . ( He goes to the refrigerator L. ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you will excuse me , I shall rejoin them . p. 168 PRINCE MIKAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OURATIEFF No ! ( He crosses R. with the tray , below the table . ) Please wait here a little longer . I prefer to serve the lemonade in peace ; I do n't want additional black looks at me because I 've deprived them of their precious petrol . ( He goes out down R. quickly with his tray . There is a pause . Tatiana remains motionless  --  GOROTCHENKO also . Then GOROTCHENKO makes a movement to take the pen-holder from the table . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( imperiously ) . Leave that alone . ( Quietly . ) It belongs to the cook . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( putting it in his pocket ) . Not now it is ours Russia 's . ( There is a pause . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( gently , almost sadly ) . Very well , take it , Commissar of pigs . COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( tenderly ) . When you send me crawling on that journey to Moscow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every metre of the way , of you , of him , and the devotion that has survived in you . ( He takes two steps towards the door R. Suddenly TATIANA runs after him to below the table. ) p. 169 GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( impetuously ) . Gorotchenko ! COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Madame ! GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA You wo n't fail to have the two flags of the Tsar fixed on to the map ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO I shall not fail . GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA ( taking another step to him ) . Then could you also have the moustache removed from my picture ? COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO ( thoughtfully ) . Well , that will entail a certain amount of red tape . But it is a promise . ( She looks at him for a moment . ) GRAND DUCHESS TATIANA PETROVNA ROMANOVA Thank you . That is all . ( She drops back to the right-hand corner of the table . ) ( GOROTCHENKO looks at her steadily . Then he almost whispers . ) COMMISSAR GOROTCHENKO Good-bye , Imperial Highness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOROTCHENKO goes C. quickly to TATIANA and kisses her shoulder .
