The political campaigns of 1938 are hardly underway . Last week , however , two springs ahead of time , the Presidential campaign of 1940 started . For handsome , white-haired Paul Vories McNutt-U . S. High Commissioner in the Philippines since 1937-alighted , like the first robin of 1940 , on U. S. shores . <P> Still boss of his State 's powerful Democratic machine although his term as Governor of Indiana ended a year ago , Paul McNutt is naturally anxious that his claims as a candidate for President shall not be forgotten . So on his first return to the U. S. his supporters found it incumbent upon them to keep him in the public eye . His trip from Manila to the White House ( to report on Far Eastern affairs ) was therefore designed on the order of a Roman triumph . <P> A mishap of the McNutt homecoming occurred in San Francisco when he and his administrative assistant , Wayne Coy , asked for an Army plane to fly them as far as Denver . Three days later , when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been transferred from Hamilton Field to second in command at the Air Corps Technical School at Chanute Field , 111. , the War Department maintained it was a " routine " change but reporters jumped to the fairly natural conclusion : that the Administration intended to snub Mr. McNutt . <P> By that time Paul McNutt was sitting down to a 2,000-place banquet at Indianapolis , where Jack Dolan of Indiana 's Democratic Editorial Association and Governor Clifford Townsend garlanded him with effusive laurel wreaths of oratory . Several days later silver-haired Mr. McNutt was in Washington , for an even more stunning event . To Washington , accustomed as it is to flamboyant entertaining , the banquet given Paul McNutt at the Mayflower Hotel was sensational . <P> On a 10-by-50-ft. buffet was piled $1,800 worth of cake , pastry and hors d'oeuvres , including the Washington Monument in sugar and a reproduction of Mt . Vernon . On another were the makings of 10,000 cocktails . Standing beside his loyal friend , Senator Sherman Minton , High Commissioner McNutt greeted 3,000 guests as they passed down the receiving line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal and Franklin Roosevelt 's Cabinet , which was represented only by Attorney General Homer Cummings and Secretary of Commerce Daniel Roper . Earlier in the day , in the presence of newsreel photographers , the guest of honor McNutt had proudly announced : " I am not a candidate for any public office at this time . " <P> All but overlooked in the uproar of the somewhat over-punctual celebration of Mr. McNutt 's arrival in Washington was his official mission : to tell the President that : 1 ) Philippine sentiment for immediate independence is declining , 2 ) that Major General Douglas MacArthur is " doing wonders " with the Philippine Army , and 3 ) that U. S. residents of the Philippines resent paying income taxes .
