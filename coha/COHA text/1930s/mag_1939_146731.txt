Assembled at and around Plattsburg , N. Y. last week for quadrennial maneuvers of the U. S. First Army were52,000 Regulars , National Guardsmen , Reservists . On and near the Civil War battlefields at Manassas , Va . were 23,000 more , sweating through the maneuvers of the Third Corps Area . All were under the command of tart , brilliant Lieut . General Hugh Aloysius Drum , who lent his games more than their usual news value with a sound-off about the Army as it is , as he thinks it should be . <P> Hugh Drum found his First Army ( one of the four field armies into which the Regular Army and National Guard are divided ) short of combat strength by 246,000 men , 3,063 machine guns , 348 howitzers , 180 field guns . What the U. S. needs , said he , is not its traditional , skeleton Army , to be expanded after war is declared , but " the creation in peacetime of a well-trained , adequately equipped and well-organized fighting force . " <P> In thus asking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drum shocked his more timorous colleagues . But he did not shock the high command in Washington . When General Malin Craig retired as Chief of Staff , he put the U. S. on notice that the U. S. military now wants its standing Army to be a fighting army , at least to the extent of five fully equipped divisions on constant peacetime call . Also on the military agenda , now that Congress has voted $961,293,102 to expand and equip the present Army , is a request for many more millions to stock complete equipment for a wartime force of 1,000,000 men .
