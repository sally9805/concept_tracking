Staked by two hard-pressed prospectors m the winter of 1935 in Nevada 's Slumbering Hills northwest of Winnemucca was a gold claim now known as the Jumbo Mine . For $10,000-$500 down-the Jumbo was sold a few months later to one George Austin , a grizzled oldster who ran the hotel and general store in a nearby flag stop called Jungo on the Western Pacific " . Jumbo ore assayed as high as $1,495 per ton . Other members of the Austin family staked adjoining claims , signed an agreement among themselves not to sell out except as a group for 50 years . With primitive equipment the Austins were quietly digging out $500 per day when Herbert Hoover suddenly put them on the national mining map last summer . Out of " purely geologic curiosity " the great engineer journeyed across the Sierras from his home in Palo Alto to inspect the Jumbo , was greatly impressed , advised the Austins to hang on ( TIME , Aug. 31 ) . George Austin announced that he would not sell at any price .

To a syndicate of Texas oilmen he leased the Jumbo for 35 years with an option to buy it outright within 20 years for a cool $10,000,000 . Under the lease the Austins will get from 10% to 20% of gross production , depending on the grade of the ore , but in no case less than $100,000 per year . Mr , Austin also stipulated that should the option be exercised , the $10,000,000 must be paid in instalments of not less than $1,000,000 annually . The $250,000 down payment last week was split equally between Mr. Austin , his thrifty wife Bernice , his brother Jess , two sons , Wilfred and Kenneth , and his daughter , Mrs. Bonnie Jean Austin Sobrio . What the Austins will do with their fortunes is a mystery . Rugged old Mr. Austin once declared : " I have two sons , and half a million would probably make loafers out of them . . . .

Mr. Hunt bought out the interests of Columbus Marion ( " Dad " ) Joiner , the oldtime wildcatter who brought in the East Texas oil field in 1930 . Mr. Wadley got his start on Louis iana &; Arkansas R. R. , made a fortune in Porter-Wadley Lumber Co. , is now one of the biggest independent oil operators in East Texas .
