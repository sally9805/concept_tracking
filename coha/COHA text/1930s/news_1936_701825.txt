txt A return to direct relief " except for worth-while and ' necessary work on a basis of cost competitive with contemporary - public construction , " was urged by General Hugh S. Johnson in a report made Oct. 26 , soon after his retirement as New York City WPA Administrator , to Harry L. Hopkins , Works Progress chief . The book- length report , suppressed by the administration , but made public by other sources today , said of WPA that " more than half of all this effort is prodigal pretense justified by nothing . " It added that " 60 per cent of this invented work is a needlessly expensive and fatuous gesture . " " I note the reiteration that new government relief plans will be ' all work and no dole , ' " the former NRA chief asserted in his report . " If it is , imagination must become more fanciful still , provide for expenditures more prodigal , and the practical result will be more parsimonious . I earnestly hope that such will not be the case . " $3,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to General Johnson , as constructive criticism , constitutes one of the strongest indictments yet made of the administration 's broad works program for alleviating unemployment . Evidence is offered of alleged administrative incompetence in Washington which , in the matter of handling payrolls , he says , led to a loss of $3,000,000 , and in labor matters to unnecessary conflicts . The author remarked here today that " it covered the early experimental phases of WPA " and added that " many of the things criticized have now been corrected . " He made it clear , however , that he had not changed his fundamental concept of how the relief problem should be handled . " The only argument in favor of work relief is that it preserves pride against the humiliation of home relief , " the general stated . " Yet , to go on work relief the rules require that a man first go on home relief . To get there he must submit to the equivalent of a pauper 's oath and a most humiliating inquisition . " If a man on home relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostracism from any kind of relief . " It is as cruel as it is stupid because the area of available relief money nowhere near covers the area of destitution , and the vast waste occasioned by this ill-informed dogma subjects the whole government to amply justified rididule . " Insistence on it not only deprives tens of thousands of people of relief but involves the government in more inconsistencies than local ingenuity can excuse . " These observations , made at a time when Congress is considering President Roosevelt 's request for . $1,500,000,000 to continue work relief next year , concluded with his statement that : " The money should be disbursed as direct relief except for worthwhile and necessary work on a basis of cost competitive with contemporary public construction . " General Johnson said , however , that if work relief were to be carried out , the WPA system offered the best means of providing quick employment . " I know what you are up against , and the efforts of other departments to earmark , freeze and immunize these funds against what they promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , of all of them , have some chance of doing in the present , " he wrote to Mr. Hopkins . " At least most of your engineering projects are useful and will employ people now . " Of white collar work , and some white collar workers in particular , he was more critical , however . Speaking of the New York City situation while he was PWA administrator , the general said : " Accompanying all this agitation of organized labor was a concurrent agitation by certain white collar groups . In many of these are Communist ' cells . ' Their demands are generally unreasonable and know no principle save the desire to embarrass the government . They are disappointed when a demand is granted . " Pay Check Delay Assailed Turning to the alleged loss of $3,000,000 through the failure of WPA to pay relief workers in New York City weekly as the WPA program was getting under way , General Johnson said that the Treasury was prepared to carry out his request , but he could not get answers to any V his telegraphed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , it became necessary to give direct relief to about 100,000 , costing $1,209,000 , for three weeks until their work checks arrived . " This double pay would have been wholly unnecessary if my request had been granted , " he commented , " and the omission cost the Federal Government a probable total eventual cost of more than $3,000,000 . " Speaking of the " security wage , " he remarked that " the argument for it theoretically was impeccable . but , as I had argued in the beginning before you asked me to take the job , it was impossible in practice . " Noting that the prevailing wage was eventually established in practice in New York City through the shortening of work hours , the general contended that much unnecessary labor agitation and many fruitless conflicts were caused by the failure of Washington to grant this wage in the first place . Says He Could Get No Replies He charged that the United States Re-employment Service had been extremely inefficient and that for a time it had been impossible to get sufficient workers for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , he said , he had never known how many people he would have to employ or exactly how much money he would have . " By actual count , 90 per cent of my letters asking various authorities and rulings were unanswered , and I was consistently unable to reach you on the telephone unless I almost literally turned in a riot call , " his report says . " All safeguards are utterly frustrated by this cavalier dealing at the source with the funds available for continuation and completion of work once started , " he continued . " No one can sit in Washington in the seat of control of this complex engineering undertaking and indulge in this arbitrary turning on and off of the means to continue work . "
