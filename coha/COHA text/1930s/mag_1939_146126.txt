Empress Nagako gave patriotic Japanese the jitters by producing four daughters before giving birth in 1933 to a son and heir to the world 's oldest unbroken dynasty . Cute , deadpan Crown Prince Akihito ( " The prince of the August Succession and Enlightened Benevolence " ) is now five years old , has his own palace , likes to climb trees and ride on the palace lawn in his toy automobile and bicycle . Twenty young sons of peers come to play with him in shifts on Wednesdays and Saturdays . Last week four more noble playmates with special talents were chosen to match Akihito 's varying moods : Yasuo Nishi , 7 , accomplished pilot of baby automobiles ; Yoshitska Torio , 7 , very good at drawing ; Takatoshi Kinoshita , 6 , a singer and athlete ; and Tsuyo Mishima , 7 , brilliant toy soldier tactician.
