On the shore of the Atlantic and the shore of the Pacific one afternoon last week lusty boos arose from the throats of 116,000 racetrack fans . At Suffolk Downs , on Boston Harbor , 66,000 New Englanders , the second largest crowd ever to witness a horse race in the U. S. gathered to watch a loudly ballyhooed meeting of War Admiral and Seabiscuit , two of the seven entries in the $50,000 added Massachusetts Handicap . Three thousand miles away , in brand-new Hollywood Park at Inglewood , 50,000 Californians gathered to watch a highly touted race , for a $50,000 purse , between Herbert M. Woolf 's Lawrin ( Kentucky Derby winner ) and William du Font 's Dauber ( Preakness winner ) to settle the " American three-year-old championship " of 1938 . <P> By a strange coincidence that happens perhaps once in a generation . Seabiscuit , whose scratching canceled the famed Memorial Day $100,000 match race with War Admiral , was withdrawn a half hour before post time because of a swollen tendon , and Dauber , who had been so excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his van while riding from the rail-road station , bruised a leg and broke a tooth , was also scratched a half hour before post time because of a bowed tendon . <P> Whether the Boston boos were louder than the Hollywood boos , no one could determine . But the disgruntled racing fans of New England , after finally settling down to comparative calm , saw one of the greatest races of the year . War Admiral , for whom Owner Samuel Riddle refused on offer of $250,000* last month , was made a 2-to-5 favorite ( in spite of a muddy track and top weight of 130 lb. ) after Seabiscuit was scratched . Leaving the post , the four-year-old Riddle colt was not in front as is his custom . Menow* , a three-year-old rated as merely a sprinter , splashed mud in War Admiral 's face all the way round , won by eight lengths . The great War Admiral , in his first defeat in twelve starts , finished out of the money for the first time in his career . <P> Three thousand miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race but made some profit . Lawrin , so overwhelming a favorite in the field of three that there was a minus pool in the parimutuels for the first time in the history of California racing** , won as he pleased . <P> Talk turned to a meeting between the two three-year-olds , Lawrin and Menow . But U. S. racing fans , apparently unable or unwilling to understand the fragility of thoroughbreds , were openly disgusted with match races . <P> <P> *Highest price ever paid lor a thoroughbred is $300,000 . Last week Martin Benson , London bookmaker , paid that amount for undefeated Xearco , an Italian horse who won the Grand Prix at Paris last fortnight , his 14th victory in a row . Only other $300,000 purchase price was for Call Boy , 1927 Epsom Derby winner . <P> Pronounced mee-now and so named by Owner Hal Price Headley after his little daughter , whose impatience at his kissing his wife first on entering the house caused her to habitually stamp and squeal ' ' Me , now ; me , now ! " <P> **Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrin . The return was $2.20 for $2 , the legal minimum of 10 on the dollar .
