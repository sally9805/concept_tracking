txt The British Commonwealth of Nations , as a substitute name for the British Empire , is usage still largely confined to scholars and orators , though it appears in official documents . Even the specialist does not rind that the new designation comes trippingly from the tongue . But with the Australian Government 's note of intercession to Mr. DE VALERA the British Commonwealth of Nations takes on a reality and completeness that it has hitherto lacked . One might almost say that the message from Canberra to Dublin gives practically a new meaning to the British Commonwealth by calling attention to a phase of it that has hitherto been in the background . The substitution of Commonwealth for Empire has been generally held to signalize attainment of a status of perfect eguality , as between , the United Kingdom and the Dominions . But the changed relationship among the Dominions themselves has not been so clearly perceived . Never having been dependent on each other , the Dominions would apparently be in exactly the same position with respect to each other in a Commonwealth as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different methods employed by New Zealand and by Australia in urging . I good counsel upon the Irish Free State . The New Zealand note was addressed to London . The Australian note went to Dublin , a plea from one " sister Dominion " to another . " Daughter am I in my mother 's house but mistress in my own , " said Canada to England through Mr. KIPLING 'S mouth . Today there are no more mother and daughters anywhere in the confines of the British Commonwealth of Nations . There are only sisters , with the United Kingdom as eldest . In the new state of things the present debate is not solely between the Irish Free State and an England in which , try as one may , ancient quarrels persist in reechoing . Mr. DE VALERA is now reminded from . Australia that in joining issue with the Government at London he is engaged on a business that directly affects the interests of the other members of the British Commonwealth . From these sister Dominions it is an assertion of right against Ireland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right against the mother country . The mobilization of Dominion sentiment against the danger of extremist action by the Irish Free State is a factor of consequence . The report that Canada was preparing to threaten Mr. DE VALERA with exclusion from the Ottawa conference turns out to be false . But Canada 's voice is bound to have an influence in an Irish Free State whose status in the treaty of 1921 is more than once defined as on an equality with Canada . The Australian note stresses the duty which Ireland owes to the sister Dominions with whom she has no historic quarrels and whose population comprises large numbers of the Irish blood . That is followed by a similar note from South Africa . In 1924-25 a South African judge , Sir RICHARD FEETHAM , was made chairman of the commission to settle the boundary between the Free State and Northern Ireland . In that there was already a suggestion of the rede of the sister Dominions as arbitrators and conciliators within the family circle .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
