From California 's high , peaceful Mt . Wilson Observatory last week Dr. Fritz Zwicky reported a tremendous celestial cataclysm which happened 3,000,000 years ago . This was a supernova , a star exploding with suicidal violence . So distant was it that long before the first creatures describable as human beings appeared , the light of the supernova 's outburst began flashing toward Earth at 186,000 mi. per sec . <P> Astronomers have not decided what causes stars to explode . Something seems to go wrong with the delicate mechanism that keeps the outward force of radiation pressure balanced against the inward force of gravity . Then the star throws off rapidly expanding shells of hot gas , increases greatly in brightness . Ordinary novae attain a maximum brightness about 25,000 times that of the sun . Therefore , since the difference between actual brightness and apparent brightness depends on distance , novae have provided important clues to the distances of the nebulae in which they occur . About 130 novae have been recorded-most of them found by chance on photographic plates . <P> Supernovae are millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millions of other stars in their nebula . About 15 have been recorded . Three years ago Dr. Zwicky , distinguished young Bulgarian-born astrophysicist who believes exploding stars may be a source of cosmic rays , brought the matter of supernovae to the attention of the National Academy of Sciences . He said then that supernovae probably cease to exist as ordinary stars ; that protons and electrons coalesce on the surface into neutrons which , having no electric charges to repel one another , " rain " down toward the centre , pack sluggishly together , creating a heavy , lifeless " neutron star . " With the possible exception of one 19th Century supernova , the supernova reported by Dr. Zwicky last week was the brightest ever studied by modern astronomers . It was ten times brighter than the average supernova , 100 times brighter than the whole island universe to which it belonged , 500,000,000 times brighter than the sun . Distant as it was , it reached a magnitude of 8.5 , which is only two magnitudes below the limit of naked-eye visibility .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
