 | On Keeping Young Condensed from The Atlantic Monthly ( June , ' 30 ) Francis G. Peabody Author of " A New England Romance , " " The Church of the Spirit , " etc . WHAT is it that keeps one young when he is growing old ? What are the effective ways of postponing surrender to the decrepitude of age ? First I should name the cultivation and maintenance of friendships . " A man , sir , " said Dr. Johnson , " should keep his friendships in constant repair . " A busy man or woman in the full swing of professional or domestic cares is likely to fancy that these affairs must come first and that friendship must wait ; but when one reaches old age he may find that in gaining the world he has lost his friends , and to paraphrase Scripture what shall a man give in exchange for his friends ? Friendship can not be improvised or delayed until leisure arrives . It must be cultivated with care , and even with the sacrifice of what seem more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it will become irreparable . If old age must necessarily involve the loss of old friends , one way to keep young is to make  | friends of the young . This does not mean that an old man should pretend to be young , or try to keep pace with young people . Nothing is more repulsive than an old man with the habits or language or vices of a young man . But , on the other hand , there is often a reciprocal happiness found when old men appreciate the activities of youth and young men respect the experience of age . Young people at the present time are likely to seem to old people lacking in reverence , amusingly defiant of tradition , and as undisguised in frankness as the nudity of the bathing beach . The old man who would keep young must be sure that human nature remains much the same from generation to generation ; that each new generation faces a new world and must be trusted to re-create it ; that one who is building a modern skyscraper must be permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be modest though their legs were bare . To appreciate the new world in its making is one of the greatest privileges of age . Sympathetic confidence in the underlying motives of the young may both win their devotion and keep oneself young . It must be admitted , however , that old age can not find its chief resource in companionship . Friends of one 's own age are withdrawn into the mystery of death , and life becomes shut away from new friends by limitations of strength and energy . Growing old is in the main an experience in solitude . How shall one keep young when he is thus alone ? One of the resources which keep a lonely old age from spiritual decline is the companionship of books . Increasing leisure and physical limitations may easily tempt one to relax intellectual interest , and to be satisfied with two newspapers a day and the frivolous literature of current events . That is a sign that one is growing old , and not keeping young . Intellectual resiliency depends upon keeping the spiritual muscles taut by exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading on subjects of generous intention and spiritual interest . The best of exercise is the mastery of a new subject or of a congenial subject hitherto casually pursued the history of an art , the details of a history , the understanding of a technical discovery , the progress of a science , the new poetry , the new aspects of religion . To know one 's subject better than most people is not only to justify self-respect , but also to grow younger in spirit as one grows older in years . A similar resource is offered to those who have felt in themselves a vague inclination for self-expression , in literature or poetry or art , but have been overmastered by the demands of business or the cares of home . Old age is not only a good time to read poetry , but a time for furtive attempts at writing the verses which have been so long suppressed ; a good time , not to paint good pictures , but to give at least the little latent talent a chance for modest and closely guarded expression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surreptitious enjoyment in production , or in cultivating beauty in phrase or color or form . It is not only possible to cheer one 's solitude by the companionship of literature and art , but this self-discipline may be greatly stimulated by the peculiar joy of the collector . It makes no great difference what the material collected may be . A rich man may choose illustrated manuscripts or Chinese jade ; but a poor man may find equally absorbing interests in chasing the first editions of a modern author , or in applying his expert knowledge to acquire at slight cost a precious chair or bowl or battered book . The exhilaration of such a chase is almost athletic in its excitement . A new range of acquaintances opens with other sportsmen of similar tastes . The new hunting field may be the easy-chair , but  | the collector 's passion outlives all hunting with horse and hounds . A further resource of age , which may be called the obverse of the habit of collecting , is to be found by prosperous people in the habit of distributing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in it find that they have nothing to do with %% hat they get . Their wealth becomes , as Ruskin said , their " illth , " for it is not well but ill with them . They grow old with riches , but without enrichment . Here enters the happiness of longcontinued concern with large causes of philanthropy or political reform or social welfare . The discovery that the distribution of money is more interesting and more challenging to wisdom than the making of money , gives to old age among the rich a new chance of keeping young . Through these reflections one is led , as if by an ascending and winding path , from companionship and friendship up to books and creative tastes , and again to the collecting of treasures and the distribution of them , until at last one reaches the high region of experience where rational religion reveals itself as the guide of life . In commending religion as a resource of old age I do not , of course , mean that its chief function is to prolong life , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tottering steps . Rather it is the experience of serenity and confidence , derived from lifelong and constant conviction of a friendly and beneficent Universe . It must be admitted that this is not the influence exerted by some types of religion on advancing age . If religious faith has been accepted as a passive submission , leaving to some higher Power the vicarious task of establishing justice and promoting progress ; if one has been bred , under a teaching of human helplessness , to cast himself as a worthless offering before the Mercy Seat then the influence of religion on old age may be rather one of preparation for death than of renewal of life . But if religious faith be the courage of a child of God , a brave venture of the spirit reenforced by a beneficent Universe , then it has in it a perennial healthfulness and vigor which give to one who is growing old in body a renaissance of heart and will . The maxim of inhibitive religion is " Prepare to die ! " The maxim of venturesome and rational religion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion faces an open grave ; the other faces an open door . This religious faith is the final resource which gives to old age that serenity and cheerfulness which keep the human spirit young .
