No S 0 S was sent out , although the radioman stood by his outfit two days with only two hours ' rest . United States Coast Guard vessels were ordered to meet the Arizpa and convoy it to port as a precaution when officials in Boston learned of the freighter 's plight . Captain Lund received wide praise today for his loyalty and devotion to duty The wooden barrels filled with resin and lashed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel was shifted to midstream later in the day where hatches were opened , permitting the use of water to aufhent the steam now being injected into number four hold to extinguish the fire . A municipal fire boat is standing by the stricken steamer , prepared to pump water into the hold as soon as the hatches are removed .
