txt At the urgent request of Controller Charles W. Berry , the Board of Estimate voted yesterday increases of personnel and of budget resources which , for the first time in the city 's history , will create in the Finance Department a Bureau of Municipal Investigation . The purpose of that bureau will be to enable city officials to keep a check against collusive or exorbitant bidding on city contracts and to prevent a recurrence of such municipal abuses as . the recent sewer scandals which cost New York and the Borough of Queens millions of dollars under the regime of Maurice E. Connolly . In fact , the Controller 's project , to Which the Board of Estimate gave its unanimous assent , is held to be a direct outgrowth of those abuses and of a realization of the limited facilities of the Controller 's office in the past to detect and check them . Payroll Increased $401,228 . The establishment of a Bureau of Municipal Investigation in the Finance Department was the outstanding feature of the resolution adopted by the board yesterday in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Controller , entailing an annual increase in his departmental payroll of $401,228 . The salaries of the new employes will range from $1,200 to $5,000 a year . All of them will be chosen under the Civil Service regulations . The project , as outlined yesterday by Controller Berry , is one to which he has given months of thought . He submitted it to Budget Director Charles L. Kohler , who assisted him in working out its details . The Budget Director presented a report yesterday approving the proposal unreservedly . As described to the Board of Estimate , the proposed Bureau of Municipal Investigation is intended to afford ready means for borough or city officers to inquire into instances which may look like collusive or exorbitant bidding on the part of unscrupulous contractors seeking city or borough contracts and to halt , such extoritions before it is too late . The bureau is to have a force of ten engineers , inspectors , draftsmen and computers . The chief assistant , engineer of the bureau is to receive $5,000 a year , another engineer $3,120 . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $4,000 , a mechanical engineer at $3,540 , an electrical engineer and a full engineering chemist at the same salary . Will Collect Cost Data . Budget Director Kohler , in his re ? port approving the Controller 's request and describing the staff of the projected bureau , said : " This force is required for a bureau whose work , in addition to general investigations for the department , will be to establish a system of control over contracts after bids have been received , with a view of showing the comparative unit price of all public works of a similar character . This progressive step , with the installation of an efficient , easily available cost data system , should be the means of bringing to the attention of the responsible public officials excessive and collusive unit price bids and , at the same time , reduce the possibility of unbalanced bidding . " Here in the bureau will be the available unit prices , and by use of these schedules the various depart . ments and borough offices can compare the bids received with the costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the cause of any striking discrepancies . " The setting up of such a bureau , it was learned , has been under consideration by the controller since the Queens sewer scandal prosecutions , which resulted in convictions of Mr. Connolly and former Borough Engineer Frederick Seely on charger of conspiracy to defraud , after it had been shown that virtually onehalf of the $29,500,000 of the Jamaica and Flushing sewer systems had gone for graft . The controller 's action was regarded in some quarters as his reply to Mr. Connolly 's attempt in his trial to blame the Financq Department for the excessive Queens sewer costs . Connolly and Seely , whose convictions have been upheld by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court , are still free under bail bonds twenty months after having been found guilty . They remain under bail pending review of the case by the Court of Appeals . No Personnel Increase Since 1928 . An investigating bureau would have been set up long before this , Controller Berry explained , but for the fact that the Finance Department has . had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and authorization for new employes was needed . The Controller made the point that establishment of the bureau will not give his office authority to pass upon contracts , but will provide easily available data for officials and taxpayers to determine whether or not costs for proposed improvements are excessive . Of the 226 new employes to be added to the force of the Controller 148 will be assigned to the Bureau of Collections , a recently organized unit , under which have been combined the former functions of various city agencies and which now permits a taxpayer to pay his real estate taxes , his water rents and other charges and assessments at a single bureau in each borough . The increased business of the Finance Department was a reason assigned by Controller Berry for augmenting his staff . He explained to the board that in 1923 the financial turnover handled by the Controller 's staff amounted to $1,042,215,000 , whereas in 1929 it was $1,712,918,000 . In 1923 the department had 971 employes . In 1929 there were 1,095 , which included 129 who had been taken over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supply , Gas and Electricity . Controller Berry explained that his department was so undermanned that 150 temporary employes were necessary in handling the tax assessment collections . Among the positions to be filled in the new force are two auditors of accounts at $3,800 each and three at $3,480 each ; 24 bookkeepers at $1,800 , and 3 bookbinders at $2,496 each . There is to be an inspector of repairs at $3,000 and an inspector of supplies at the same salary . The balance of the personnel will be clerks .
