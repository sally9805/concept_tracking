Three days ' vituperative debate last week preceded a vote in the Tennessee House of Representatives on Impeachment Article No. 1 against Governor Henry Hollis Horton . The charge was that he had conspired with Col. Luke Lea , newspaper publisher , and Rogers Clark Caldwell , financier , to manipulate State funds for their private profit in building up an economic empire in the South ( TIME , June 8 ) . In four defunct banks , subsidiaries of the bankrupt Caldwell &; Co. , Tennessee had some $6,400,000 in public funds tied up . Governor Horton was depicted as bowing to the dictation of Messrs . Lea &; Caldwell in return for their political support . <P> Leader of the impeachment drive was U. S. Congressman Edward Hull Crump , Democratic boss of Memphis . Cried one of his Memphis henchmen in the Tennessee House : " Do n't let anybody tell you Governor Horton 's not listening to Lea and Caldwell . They pour water into his ear and tell him it 's raining . " Defenders of Governor Horton argued that the attempt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy to overthrow the State government and seize its reins by a few ambitious men . " They insisted no specific wrong-doing was charged against him , no positive evidence adduced to sustain the general charge . When the House finally voted ( 58-10-41 ) to dismiss Impeachment Article No. 1 , the capitol at Nashville thundered with cheers and applause . <P> Still pending against Governor Horton , however , were seven other articles of impeachment , brought in earlier last week . Frankly trivial , these accused him , among other things , of spending $2,800 in State funds for a grand piano for the Executive Mansion three days after publicly stating that he would not do so ; of pardoning a Memphis gambler while he was still a fugitive from justice ; of dismissing two State highway commissioners because they would not " abdicate and surrender their official consciences " ; of failing to account for public funds until after his reelection . The Governor 's friends and allies were confident , however , that the defeat of the conspiracy charge , a political catchall , doomed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy was Governor Horton . Happier still was Col. Lea who viewed the House 's action as a turning point in his own political tide . His attorneys assured him he would be quickly cleared of the indictments against him at Knoxville and Asheville , growing out of the Caldwell &; Co. crash . He expected shortly to get back his Memphis Appeal and his Knoxville Journal which have been in receivership . Then he would start battling again against the Crump faction of Tennessee Democracy , attempt to regain his lost political ascendancy in the State . Gradually in the public mind a distinction was being made between Col. Lea and Mr. Caldwell . The latter was the promoter who had undertaken to finance the expansion of the Lea papers as only one of his many empire-building schemes . Col. Lea remained the publisher-politician who had little or nothing to do with the other Caldwell structures which toppled into economic ruin last November .
