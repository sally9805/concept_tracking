Two years ago Franklin Roosevelt plucked pitcher-eared little Frank Ramsay McNinch from the Federal Power Commission to make him chairman of the turbulent Federal Communications Commission . McNinch 's assignment was a clean-up job supposed to last about three months . Under Cleaner-Upper McNinch , FCC has been more turbulent than ever . FCC Commissioners were at odds on its investigations into superpower and radio rates , practically disavowed Commissioner Walker 's drastic 1,100 page report on American Telephone &; Telegraph Co . Capping the thunder-headed cumulus was Chairman McNinch 's unrelenting war on two fellow-Commissioners , publicity-hunting George Henry Payne and the Navy 's Commander Tunis Augustus MacDonough Craven , the Commission 's only technical man . <P> This year Chairman McNinch dragged FCC 's brawls into Congress with a reorganization bill that would let him eliminate Commissioners Payne and Craven , remove many lesser FCC jobs from civil service . But neither Frank McNinch nor his Chief is so popular with Congress as he once was , and the FCC reorganization bill was shelved . <P> Last week 66-year-old Chairman McNinch , ill since April with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such cases , Franklin Roosevelt published their exchange of letters , praised Frank McNinch 's work . Broadcasting-Broadcast Advertising , radio 's authoritative trade journal , observed : " He certainly was not lacking in courage , and no one questions his sincerity , though many in radio have not seen eye to eye with him on the majority of his proposed ' reforms . ' But ... his selection of William J. Dempsey as general counsel has proved a boon to the efficiency of the FCC . " <P> Before the radio industry had time to cross its fingers over the President 's intentions , he acted . Once more Franklin Roosevelt went outside FCC to pick a chairman . Like Frank McNinch , 41-year-old James Lawrence Fly made his name with the New Deal program . TVA 's general counsel since 1937 , able Jim Fly won TVA 's two major tilts in the Supreme Court . A tall , quiet , hard-working Texan who graduated from Annapolis and spent three years in the Navy before loping through Harvard Law School in two years , Lawyer Fly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the respect of many private utilitarians by his moderation and tact in TVA disputes . By naming new Chairman Fly practically on the eve of Congress ' adjournment , Franklin Roosevelt did his best to insure the appointment against Senatorial objections . Observers guessed that Jim Fly 's assignment at FCC would be less a cleaner-upper than a mopper-upper.
