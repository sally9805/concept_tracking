Strangest aspect of the career of the late Colonel T. E. Lawrence was the astonishing lack of success that attended his efforts to keep out of the public eye . <P> Few secrets in recent history have been so badly kept as Lawrence 's many secret missions and changes of identity , his periodic and highly publicized droppings-out-of-sight . Few carefully-guarded , privately-printed volumes have become so well-known as his Seven Pillars of Wisdom . Last month the curtain was drawn from another characteristic Lawrence concealment when Critic Henry Seidel Canby , beating the release date on a book by 14 years , received Lawrence 's $500,000 posthumous volume , The Mint , for The Saturday Review of Literature . <P> By the terms of Lawrence 's will , The Mint can not be published until 1950 . To comply with U. S. copyright laws and prevent printing , Publishers Doubleday , Doran &; Co. printed twelve copies of the book , deposited two with the Library of Congress , as the law requires , offered the remainder for sale at $500,000 each . The ten books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mineola . L. I. , are not displayed by the publisher in accordance with Lawrence 's will , although anyone with $500,000 to spend can buy a copy . Consequently Critic Canby , reading one of the two copies in the Library of Congress was one of the most fortunate of book reviewers , since few readers are in a position to disagree with his judgments on the literary merit and historical value of The Mint . <P> Although he uses characteristically generous language , the main impression conveyed by Dr. Canby is that The Mint is not worth the price asked for it . It is a book of about 200 pages , 9 in. by 10 in. , which can be read through in half an hour .
