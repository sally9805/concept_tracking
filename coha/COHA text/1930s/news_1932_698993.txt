txt War-Debt Payment as Warning . To the Editor of The Neu York Times : While agreeing to a great extent with Senator Borah , that the cancellation or reduction of the war debts might be the best way out of our present economic troubles , yet I wonder if , in the interest of the generations to come , we would be doing the right thing . It seems to me by wiping out all the war debts we as good as tell the future generations that if they should decide to become embroiled in another war they can spend money right and left , borrowing all that is necessary , and then , when it is all hover , these debts need not be paid . I wonder If it would not be better to declare a five or ten year moratorium on all war debts to tide over the present depression , after which time the payments can be stretched over a period of fifty or even one hundred years . Then as each annual payment comes due the people have a constant reminder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is well worth while . M. WALPIN . New York , July 29 , 1932.
