txt Civil Employes ' Pensions They Are Regarded as Warranted , but Reform of System Is Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Peter Schneider of the New York City Employes Union 's executive committee is unduly alarmed over , and in error concerning , parts of my letter to THE TIMES regarding pension reform . I know of nothing more just than that a civil employe who spends his lifetime in the citizens ' service should receive a pension . That the public recognizes that right as a part of his salary Is evidenced by its contribution of 55 per cent of the cost of retirement benefits toward funds which are on an actually sound basis . But does Mr. Schneider defend the firemen 's system , whose members contribute nothing ? Have n't the people discharged fully their obligation in voting a $3,000 salary , after three years ' service , for firemen , together with the three-platoon system ? Does Mr. Schneider defend the police retirement fund , whose members also were voted a $3,000 annual salary at the end of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 2 per cent of their salaries , representing 21 per cent of the cost , and the city pays the other 79 per cent ? Or such pensions as that last ' week granted the former president of City College ( $9,980 a year ) , who at 56 years of age retired with forty-one years ' service gained by working day and evenings at $21,000 a year for the day job alone in the past few years ? Mr. Schneider misinterpreted my reference to HOLC foreclosures . I was thinking of the many home owners , taxpayers , who furnish the money for the city 's financial needs and now no longer are real estate taxpayers . When the HOLC forecloses , the city loses a taxpayer , but the Federal Government assumes the tax burden , pays the city 's taxes on the foreclosed property and spends more money to renovate the property until it can be sold . The city is dotted with Federal-supported homes , which means that all of us now pay the taxes formerly paid by a home owner out of his individual income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extension of the amortization period , a reduction of interest rates to 3e : : per cent  --  the HOLC has borrowed at We , 2% , 2 : ! ; and 3 per cent and all of the bonds are selling above par , the 3 per cents bringing nearly 10 points ' premium in today 's bond market  --  and a brief two-year moratorium on foreclosures , provided interest and taxes are paid . The friends of the civil service will find a real danger confronting them if such pension reform as the BabcockSeelye bill ' proposed is not effected . There will he no new schools , no new hospitals , no new sewage - disposal plants , no new parks and playgrounds . Moreover , there will be reduction of forces throughout the departments . It is to the best interests of all members of the civil service to support reform for those retirement systems which now are unsound and discriminate against the sound systems . The continued existence of the two unsound systems menaces all of them , and defending them is rendering no service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn , June 28 , 1939 . Disapproving of Isolation No Harm to Us Is Seen Should We Join M. Bonnet 's Peace Front To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet of France spoke the other day at Arcachon and expressed the idea that the United States should join in a peace front with Great Britain and France . This proposition met , as your Washington correspondent says , with " an exceedingly frigid reception . " The State Department , as further reported , " unofficially pointed out that the United States does not enter into alliances . " We want to be a rich country ; we want , our laboring class well fed , well paid and well leisured ; we want a prosperous middle class , and perhaps a wellto-do upper one . Can we ' achieve such goals by isolation ? Does not our prosperity depend on the number of outlets for our goods and services , on the keeping open of ship lanes and , above all , on a desire on the part of other people to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted as having said that " the United States Government and its people would make their own decisions on foreign policy without European interference . " Does the venerable Senator believe for a moment that M. Bonnet meant to interfere with the decisions of the United States Government on foreign policy ? What the Frenchman apparently had in mind was our moral support . Can we not extend that without fear of being interfered with ? Representative Tinkham is quoted as going even farther and saying " there is no manoeuvre which both France and Britain will not undertake to commit the United States to the coming war in Europe . " I can not predict what may happen in case of a war in Europe , but we would not have to be dragged into it ; there will be sufficient reasons to prompt us to go in of our own volition and without being committed by anybody . The leaders of old Germany have made the mistake of minimizing the value of America by depending on those who hold for peace at any price . They forgot that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more , those who talk one way are likely to change their minds . and it would not take them long to do it . BASIL ALEXANDER . New York , June 30 , 1939 . Children at the World 's Fair To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have been to the World 's Fair several times and invariably meet children all over , inside and outside of the buildings . It has been wonderful to watch them . No rioting , no quarreling ; or- derly about disposing of papers , boxes and bottles from their luncheons ; no destruction of flowers or plants , and in the buildings they refrain from touching anything , and quietly and intelligently examine all the wonderful exhibits . To me it is truly remarkable and they all deserve commendation , for no matter whether they are alone , in groups , with or without teachers or parents , their behavior is always perfect . S. THORNE HILL . New York , June 26. 1939 . Error by Mr. Chamberlain Prime Minister Charged With Blunder in Recent Cardiff Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these grave days clearness of thought and exactness of expression , in the diplomatic exchanges occurring so constantly , are a primary duty of statesmen . Nevertheless , in a speech at Cardiff recently Prime Minister Chamberlain buttressed his denial that England is endeavoring to encircle Germany by saying : " The aim of our foreign policy is now , as always , to establish a peaceful world . " What persuaded him to utter those two words " as always " ? What does " as always " mean to any reader of history ? Millions now living remember how England 's soldiers erased the Boer republics and took possession of South Africa thirty-seven years ago . Millions also recall how , a few years beforle that , " Chinese " Gordon died fighting at the head of his troops at Khartum in the Sudan , hundreds of miles up the Nile in North Africa . A small number remember how Gordon won the sobriquet of " Chinese , " which is engraved on his tombstone in St. Paul 's Cathedral . And who does not know that practically every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Gibraltar to Hong Kong , was accumulated by aggression , much of it of the fiercest type ? Is Mr. Chamberlain so naive as to think that Hitler and Stalin do not know and do not remember these things ? Does he not realize he is referring to the very thing they want to avoid ? How can he expect them to believe ha wants a peaceful world when he says " as always " ? Last Saturday Anne O'Hare McCormick said truly that distrust of England in the mind of Stalin is blocking the Anglo-Russian rapprochement . Stalin certainly remembers the Crimea , where , as every school child knows , " somebody blundered . " When Stalin thinks of the Crimean War and recalls England 's military adventures at Archangel and Murmansk in 1919 , what is his mental reaction to Mr. Chamberlain 's stupidity ( I call it ) in saying " as always " to the German and Russian dictators ? Times without number Britain has proudly proclaimed that it has " muddled through " one crisis after another . Is n't it about time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practical view of international responsibilities and realities was adopted in Downing Street ? JOHN Mooss . Brooklyn , June 29 , 1939 . Conditions Found Changed To THE EDITOR OF the NEW YORK TIMES : Ever since the crash of 1929 it has been customary to say that this country is short on confidence , Restore confidence , people say , and the old-time momentum will he regained . The important thing that . analysts and commentators overlook is that there have been definite factors working for the present turn of affairs , They would rather not remind themselves , and others , that the United States presently is up against a blank wall principally because the period of fundamental expansion is over , because the country is built up . The sky was the limit and the frontier was here , consequently we have the congested cities dotting the map from coast to coast and the towers in them , the industrial plants , the mines , the network of railways and paved highways . Because all of these are here is the reason for lack of faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider that the forces of growth are spent . Confidence will return when an adjustment has been made to the circumstance of a built-up country , when there is a universal recognition that the United States of today is not the country of fifty , twenty-five or even ten years ago. , JOHN SZYMANSKI . Bridgeport , Conn. , June 28 , 1939 . Mr. Lyon 's Address To THE EDITOR OF TILE NEW YORK TIMES : May I call your attention to what seems to me to he the misleading headline covering the account of the address which I gave at the Stevens Institute of Technology conference aL Johnsonburg on the evening of June 24 . The news report appeared in THE TIMES of June 25 under the heading " Federal Activities in Business Defended as in the Public Interest . " In my remarks I attempted to indicate something of the extent and direction of governmental activities in recent years and suggest some of the problems this raised . I said nothing either in defense of this development nor in the way of condemnation . The remarks were merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brookings Institution .
