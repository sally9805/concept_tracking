txt Assessor John S. Clark asserted yesterday that hundreds of millions of dollars will be added to the assessed value of 1937 Cook county personal property rolls and predicted that the increase would be reflected in reduced tax rates in Chicago . The tax rate here reached an all time high of $9.52 per $100 of assessed valuation for 1936 . The increase in personalty assessments , Clark said , would come through higher valuations on factory machinery and the discovery in federal income tax returns of hitherto concealed assets . Clerks Examine Returns . Clark has a large staf of clerks examining income tax returns available to local tax assessors under a recent federal law . Clark 's employes also are making studies of reports filed with the federal securities and exchange commission . " The adding of these millions , " said Clark , " will be a big break for all taxpayers except those of wealth who have successfully hidden their assets up to now . " Assessors in several north shore t ( wnships where many wealthy perons live are cautioning them to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedules . The assessors are advising well-todo residents that they may find themselves in difficulty if there is too great a difference in values claimed in their personalty schedules compared with those on file in income tax returns which are open to Assessor Clark . Changes Machine Assessments . Clark said the ' six year old practice of debasing the value of factory machinery by 40 per cent before the 37 per cent equalization factor is applied will be discontinued . Machinery , which comprised more than one-third of the total $486,780,235 personal property assessed valuation in 1936 , according to Clark , will be assessed at its full value . . He said that machinery owned by corporations would be valued at the same figures as the corporation file in their schedule of assets in their income tax returns . Clark issued a statement showing that the percentage of 1936 personalty taxes collected is the highest in Many Years . Ten days after the Aug. 31 penalty deadline 61.2 per cent of the 1936 personalty taxes was collected , compared with 50.78 per cent at a corresponding time after 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934 taxes . The reason for the improvement , according to Clark , is that assessments last year were more equitable . In 1936 more than 600,000 with personal assessment of less than $400 were dropped from the rolls .
