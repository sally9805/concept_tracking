New Dealers generally admit that the first four years of the New Deal had two outstanding failures : 1 ) The building industry was allowed to lag behind general recovery . 2 ) The Government did not provide decent low-cost housing on a scale big enough to make a dent in U. S. slums . Last week when Senator Robert Wagner of New York thrust a housing bill into the legislative hopper , President Roosevelt was prompt to announce that the Wagner measure or one similar was " must " legislation for this session of Congress . <P> Year ago Senator Wagner got a similar measure passed by the Senate but the House failed to act on it . Now he has revised his bill , modeled it alter England 's successful housing measures . Chief features of the Wagner housing bill , 1937 model : <P> All the diverse housing activities of the Government would be lodged in one three-man Housing Authority . During the next four years $1,500,000,000 of low-cost housing would be erected by local authorities under Federal supervision . Two-thirds of the money would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government guaranteed , principal and interest . The remaining third would be issued directly by local authorities . Dwellings for 375,000 families ( houses or apartments ) would be built at an average cost of $4,000 . Rentals would be $6 ( or less ) per room per month . Only families which could not get safe and sanitary housing elsewhere would be accepted as tenants , thereby eliminating competition with private landlords . <P> To do all this , the only money which would be taken directly from the taxpayer 's pocketbook would be the difference between the $6 room rent and the rent that would otherwise have to be charged . This subsidy , paid by the Housing Authority and limited to 45% of the necessary rental income on any project , would amount to $450,000,000 spread over 60 years . Thus Senator Wagner estimated that the Government would put up only $1 for every $29 put up by private investors during the first four years and in the long run would pay about 2% of the $1,000,000,000 Federal loan for better housing . <P> One trouble with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not launched four years ago . Construction costs have already risen sharply . If a building boom starts in the next four years , costs may go so high as to wreck some of Senator Wagner 's nice arithmetic .
