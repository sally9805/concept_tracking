Experimental physicists have found that the electron has an intrinsic mass or " weight " of about **29;1212;TOOLONG gram . This quantity is usually represented by the convenient symbol m . Both experimental and mathematical physicists have regarded m as a major constant of nature , a foundation stone of the universe . <P> Last week as hundreds of the nation 's scientists journeyed home from the midwinter convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , physicists were excited and disturbed because doubt had been cast on the constancy of m . The doubter was Professor George Eric MacDonnell Jauncey of Washington University ( St. Louis ) . In a specially arranged speech after the close of the meeting , he urged that m be considered a variable , offered experiments to back up his view . <P> In recent months Carl David Anderson of California Institute of Technology has been experimenting with a peculiar particle which showed up in the cosmic rays reaching earth . It appeared that this " X-particle " had a considerably higher mass than m , so Dr. Anderson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of m , was quite sure it was not an electron . Jabez Curry Street of Harvard measured the X-particle 's mass at 130 times m , although he said it might be subject to a 25% error either way . <P> Some weeks ago George Eric MacDonnell Jauncey got a hunch that the X-particle was originally an ordinary electron whose mass had somehow been increased . He imagined what would happen if a high-energy cosmic ray photon struck an electron in the upper atmosphere . Most of the transferred energy would simply give the electron a high-velocity kick . But some of it might be converted into matter which the electron would absorb , increasing its mass . The increase might be any amount at all , depending on the initial energy of the cosmic ray and the variable quantity of matter produced . Dr. Jauncey sent off a letter on these speculations to the editor of the Physical Review . <P> Then it occurred to him that perhaps the electrons emitted on earth by cathode ray tubes and radioactive substances might be variable in mass , too . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior of beta rays ( fast electrons ) shooting out of radium would be cleared up . Also it would make the concept of the neutrino unnecessary . The neutrino is a hypothetical particle imagined by physicists as a carrier of energy which mysteriously disappears when one element is transmuted into another . If it is assumed that the vanished energy has taken the form of greater mass in the electron , the neutrino , which has never been found in the laboratory , loses its reason for existence .
