Like a scared mouse scuttling along a kitchen wall , the celebrated little U. S. freighter City of Flint hugged the rough Norwegian coast last week as it crept down from Troms . The Government of Norway , not the least like a skittish housewife in its presence , detailed the mine layer Olaf Tryggvason and a torpedo boat to watch her . Off a fiord north of Bergen , the German prize crew requested that because of a sick man aboard , it should be allowed to put in at Haugesund , 60 miles south of Bergen and last port before the jump-off into British-patrolled waters . A doctor from Olaf Tryggvason went aboard , but all he could find by way of sickness was a man who had barked his shin on a barrel . Russia had let City of Flint enter Murmansk on the unverified claim of engine trouble ; cocky little Norway , having found no basis for the second claim to asylum , refused the request . <P> But when City of Flint reached Haugesund , it dropped anchor anyhow . Norwegian officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . " Orders from my Government , " said the prize chief . Norway at once interned the prize crew , released City of Flint to her captain to go wherever he had a mind ( see p. 16 ) . He headed for neutral Bergen to wait for the political nor'easter to wane . Germany , in a great show of fury , protested to Norway . Norway coolly rejected the protest , with a review of the case which made it look very much as though Germany , wanting neither to risk the North Sea crossing nor to lose face by giving the ship back to its U. S. crew , had deliberately sought internment . <P> &gt;Meantime another freighter , the British Coulmore , became another ship-of-the-week . During heavy weather at night , 500 miles east of Nantucket , she radioed she had been attacked by a submarine , wanted rescuing . To the spot rushed U. S. Coast Guard cutters and destroyers and the U. S. press got excited because Coulmore 's message placed her near the zone where the Panama Conference and President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Captain W. W. Kuhne of American Export Line 's Excambion docked at Boston and snorted : " The whole thing sounds fishy ! . . . Very heavy seas were running . It was pitch-dark . Visibility was almost zero . In my opinion no submarine could have operated successfully . " <P> Presently American Trader radioed that Coulmore was perfectly safe , but did not explain the scare . Germany called it a scurvy British trick . <P> &gt;Into the Panama Canal Zone went the British cruiser Despatch with news that somewhere in the Caribbean last month she had overhauled the German tanker Emmy Friederich , carrying 40,000 barrels of Mexican oil and quantities of provisions , ostensibly bound for Sweden but more likely for a sea-raider rendezvous ( TIME , Oct. 30 ) . When Despatch 's men boarded her , Emmy 's men opened her seacocks , scuttled the prize . Despatch passed through the Canal into the Pacific , perhaps to chase the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer , which was believed to have rounded the Horn . Two German freighters which had taken refuge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed their cargoes of soybeans for fuel oil .
