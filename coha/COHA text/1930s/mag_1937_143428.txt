SERENADE - James M. Cain - Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> In The Postman Always Rings Twice James Mallahan Cain wrote a brief , brisk best-seller in which philosophic overtones could be dimly heard above the rattling melodrama of the plot . Last week he published a second novel that is just as melodramatic as his first , a little longer , equally swift reading . It has its quota of close shaves , fights , flights and two-dimensional characters , suggests an old-fashioned pulp magazine thriller brought up to date by a writer who knows Freud as well as all tricks of suspense . Its hero ( and narrator ) is a world-famous singer who has lost his voice as well as his self-respect , expresses himself in language more appropriate to a police reporter than a star of the Metropolitan . <P> Serenade begins when tough , embittered John Howard Sharp , once an opera star , now a singer in tenth-rate Mexico City night clubs , gets involved in an argument with a bullfighter over a prostitute , takes her home , is invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the steamy coast town of Acapulco . As he is driving to Acapulco with the owlish , observant Juana , a storm drives them into one of Mexico 's closed churches , where Howard builds a fire , cooks meals , despite Juana 's fears of sacrilege . While the candles blow out , thunder rolls and lightning flashes , Howard sings , attacks the girl after she has ridiculed him . She tries to kill him . For some reason unknown to him Howard discovers that his voice has returned . <P> After this nightmarish episode , which is followed almost immediately by a nightmarish encounter with police , they escape to the U. S. , where Howard climbs slowly back to fortune by way of unpaid radio appearances in Los Angeles , a chance to fill in during an operatic emergency , a role in a cheap movie that turns into a hit . When he is on top of the world again , with Juana in a Gramercy Park hideaway in Manhattan , his evil genius appears-a suave , wealthy , possessive conductor and music patron named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guesses what is wrong , learns that Hawes had been obscurely responsible for his previous decline , tells him contemptuously that only men can sing . Treating bluntly a theme that was almost too delicate for Proust , Author Cain brings his story to a violent conclusion , with Hawes and Juana both dead , the singer silent again . But Howard no longer thinks of his own tragedy , broods instead on the ruin he caused a girl who knew more about him than he knew about himself .
