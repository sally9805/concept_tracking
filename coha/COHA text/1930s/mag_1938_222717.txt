Most spectacular provision of eccentric , wealthy Lawyer Charles Vance Millar 's last will &; testament was an award of his estate 's residue to the Toronto woman who , in ten years after his death , would prove to be the city 's champion child-producer . A bachelor , Mr. Millar was not experienced enough to foresee a tie . After 17 months of legal haggling , the prize money of Toronto 's famed " stork derby " was awarded last week . Four buxom , prolific , poor mothers , each having produced nine children during the ten-year period , split the money between them , received checks for $100,000 each . Out of this one mother must return to the Toronto Relief Administration $5,696 another $2,314 , loaned during the tough-going days . With two mothers the judges had difficulty . One claimant had given birth to three stillborn children . Five of another woman 's children were not products of wedlock . To these two maternal runners-up went $12,500 each as consolation prizes to insure against further litigation . Still left in the Millar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided later among the four big winners after all legal expenses have been met by the estate .
