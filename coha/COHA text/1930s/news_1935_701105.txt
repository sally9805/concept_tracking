txt The AngloGerman conversations upon armaments , security pacts and the present state of Europe came to a close this evening . Their result , as far as is ascertainable tonight , has been wholly negative , unless there is counted favorably the fact that sooner or later the British and the Germans had to come face to face and hear directly from each other as much of their respective view ' points as it was considered proper to reveal . Reichsfuehrer Adolf Hitler , for example , heard directly from the lips of Sir John Simon , British Foreign Secretary , how seriously concerned the British people had become over the tendencies in the new Germany . He was informed of the feeling in Britain that , unless some amelioration of the German truculent attitude could be devised , there must be evolved a system of European security that might work out to Germany 's disadvantage . Unyielding on Armament . Germany has suggested no compromise in the matter of her rearmament beyond repeating the familiar statement that when a proper plan of all-round limitation is laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun for gun and man for man . on a basis of equality . It has even been intimated that the three other great powers  --  Britain , France and Italy ? might provisionally frame such a plan at their forthcoming meeting in Stresa and submit it to her . Meantime , however , German rearmament will proceed . As to the regional pacts intended to provide for general European security , the German objections to them were again stated and the former Allies were left to meet these objections . The air pact , at present somewhat nebulous , was favored in principle if it were confined to Western Europe . As to the state of Europe Germany again voiced her complaints regarding some aspects thereof , all in general terms . Conditions in Memel in respect to the German minority there , some of whose members have been tried and convicted of political activities subversive to the Lithuanian State , were particularly specified . It is understood that Germany expressed a willingness to sign a non-intervention pact regarding Austria , first , if all other powers also would sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted by vote to decide their own future . Germany believes such a plebiscite with a propaganda accompaniment would insure a Nazi Austria . Basis for Return to League . Germany 's return to the League of Nations is conditional , flit , upon attainment of her status of equality especially in the matter of armaments ( which would , of course , , entail withdrawal of the French complaint to the League against her conscription and her air force as constituting unilateral denunciation of the Versailles treaty ) ; secondly , upon a thorough reorganization of the League . Other German complaints have concerned the increased armaments of the Reich 's neighbors . These were supported today by elaborate charts and categories of armaments . In short , little that is new has been learned on either side , but the ? facts of the situation have been presented officially . Nothing has been conceded upon any point whatever . There is a general impression that the conversations , except for a fifteen-minute statement by Sir John Simon and many pointed questions , assumed very much the aspect of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this impression . It is also generally conceded that the talks on the second day while briefer were more difficult than those on the first day since today the nub of the matter , that is , the question of armaments , was tackled in earnest , but got nowhere . It is certain that the French , who were not particularly pleased last night by the British attitude , are more content with today 's outcome and wear an aspect of saying inwardly , " I told you so . " It is also certain that many British are puzzled by Sir John 's demeanor , mystified by the policy he seems to be pursuing , and suspect him of playing a lone hand  --  which may not be the case at all . British Officially Cheerful . All this , however is hidden beneath an outward aspect of British optimism , which presents a smiling surface spread over all crevasses of difference . Sir John with Anthony Eden , Lord Privy Seal , accompanying him , received the foreign press this evening in the ballroom of the British Embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , as if explaining to naughty and not over , intelligent schools boys the ABC of diplomacy comprehensible only to greater mentalities , he painted a picture of the situation that skillfully implied , without saying so directly , that all was well in this best of possible worlds . What he said , however , was " for the guidance " of the experienced journalists gathered around him and in no sense for quotation . Sir John began by reading the joint official communiqu ? issued by the conference as follows : The Anglo-German conversations conducted between Sir John Simon , Captain Anthony Eden , Reichsfuehrer Hitler and Baron von Neurath were concluded tonight . The subjects under discussion were the matters set out in the London communiqu ? of Feb. 3 . The conversations were carried on in the frankest and friendliest spirit and resulted in a complete clarification of each other 's viewpoints . Both sides agreed that they were pursuing the goal of securing and consolidating the peace of Europe by promoting ' international cooperation . Both the German and British Ministers are satisfied of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London by air tomorrow , while Captain Eden proceeds to Moscow , Warsaw and Prague tonight . Avoids Awkward Questions . Disclaiming any intention of revealing beyond this anything that had happened in the conference and specifically warning his hearers that everybody who knew him was aware that he could never be in- ' duced to say anything he did not want to reveal , Sir John neatly forestalled all awkward questions . Then in simple sentences and words of one syllable he proceeded to outline the diplomatic situation that had brought about this conference and express his satisfaction that it had been held . Most of his remarks were devoted to this end . It may thus be said that the British official view is that the conference was necessary for many reasons and - that its objects , which weilie exploratory and discursive , have been attained . The view that the British envoys should come here has been confirmed . Four topics  --  security , armaments , the League and air forces  --  have been covered in the conversations . No attempt has been made to reach an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the visit was merely exploratory and , secondly , because there was involved no question of an Anglo-German agreement but one among all the powers concerned . The British official view is that if general agreements are desired the worst thing possible would be to attempt to reach a specific agreement in advance between two of the parties concerned . From this same British official viewpoint , it has been a complicated visit , but the envoys are glad that they came and are convinced that such direct meetings are the best way to proceed , although they are returning without any agreement in their pockets . It is also admitted that " obviously very serious differences exist , " so the next task will be to examine these carefully and then see what can be done to compose them . More data will be gathered by Mr. Eden on his tour , after which an effort will be made to put the whole thing together with the hope that at the forthcoming meeting in , Stresa a new picture may begin to take shape . From other quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly armaments and the proposed air pact and proved the least satisfying of those held so far . However , general ' acknowledgement is made of the frankness in which the exchanges proceeded . It is the German attitude that , the failure of their own suggestions having now compelled them to take their own course regarding armaments , the other powers should now frame for submission to Germany limitation proposals , which on the proper level of equality she would be ready to consider . As to the proposed air convention , Germany still welcomes it as applied to Western Europe and is prepared to participate because it makes for security in that region . Hitler Is Dinner Host . Thus the first of the series of conferences upon the result of which the peace of Europe may depend has closed . The conferees lunched together at the British Embassy today . Tonight Herr Hitler entertained at an informal dinner in the Chancellory . Several male stars of the German opera sang . Just before midnight Mr. Eden set out by train on his tour . Sir John Simon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his government that decisions may ' be taken in readiness for the crucial meeting of the three powers at Stress a fortnight hence . The Diplomatische Politische Korrespondenz , which reflects German official opinion , devotes today 's issue to speculating on the effect of the conversations abroad . They represent , it says , " a new start " and thus are destined to enrich Europe with fresh hopes that also should contribute a new pulse to international politics . It would seem , however , observes this semi-official organ , that Europe Is not yet in a receptive mood for such a new beginning because of the painful habit still widely prevalent , of making Germany responsible for everything that happens between heaven and earth . It proceeds to blame French politicians for perpetuation of this habit . " The results of the Berlin conversations , " says the organ finally , " can only redound to the salvation of Europe if they are dealt with in Stresa with respect , good-will and sincerity .
