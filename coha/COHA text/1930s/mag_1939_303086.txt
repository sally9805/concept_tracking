A wit , a detective-story writer ( The Viaduct Murder ) , for twelve years Roman Catholic chaplain at Oxford University , is Monsignor Ronald Arbuthnott Knox , 51 , one of England 's three most urbane and influential Catholic priests. * Published in the U. S. this week was Monsignor Knox 's latest book , Let Dons Delight. + . To many a reader , Catholic and non-Catholic , this work will bring delight . To others , including many U. S. Catholics who find it difficult to comprehend the lightheartedness and apparent irreverence of their European coreligionists , the book will be shocking . <P> Let Dons Delight is a series of dialogues among imaginary dons in an imaginary Oxford College ( Simon Magus ) , taking place at 50-year intervals from 1588 to 1938 . In the early passages , Monsignor Knox does not spare his readers the " brutish superstitions " and the " idolatrous mass-altars " which were the phrases of anti-Catholics . Nor , later , does he disdain to write comedy : <P> Mr. Savile : " . . . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England as she is and ever has been , a part of the Catholic Church . ... " <P> Dr. Greene : " I must beg of you , Mr. Savile , that you will not refer to the English Church as if it were some female of your acquaintance . I tell you , I can not digest my dinner if you will talk so . " <P> For dons of all persuasions , Monsignor Knox furnishes , between dialogues , imaginary documentation of his characters , some of it in the form of brilliant literary parodies . Best known of the authors whose style he imitates to a comma are James Boswell , Harold Nicolson . <P> Exuberant " Ronnie " Knox , son of the late Anglican Bishop of Manchester , brother of Editor Edmund George Valpy ( " Evoe " ) Knox of Punch , has been a man of letters since he wrote Latin and Greek epigrams at ten . Brought up an Anglican , he took holy orders soon after leaving Oxford 's Balliol College , became Anglican chaplain of Trinity College . Converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1919 . In 1926 , the year he became Oxford 's chaplain , Father Knox scared England over the radio just as Orson Welles scared the U. S. last autumn : he broadcast a lurid account of a revolution in London , complete with Big Ben Tower blown up , the National Gallery ablaze . Famed at Oxford is " Ronnie " Knox 's reply to a fellow-undergraduate who wrote the Hegelian limerick : <P> There was a young man who said , " God Must think it exceedingly odd That the Juniper tree Just ceases to be When there 's no one about in the quad . " Wrote Knox : Dear Sir , it is not at all odd , I am always about in the quad . <P> Thus the Juniper tree Never ceases to be Since observed by yours faithfully God . This summer Monsignor Knox retires from Oxford to execute a commission given him by England 's Roman Catholic bishops : a new translation of the Vulgate ( Latin ) scriptures . <P> *The others : Rev.
