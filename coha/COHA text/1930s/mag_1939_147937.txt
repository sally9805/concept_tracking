One of England 's greatest cathedrals is Ely , a Norman-to-perpendicular pile which stands on an eminence commanding the fen country of Cambridgeshire . Named for the eels abounding in its waters , eely Ely is a market town of only 8,000-odd inhabitants . Its fairs , held on the feast of Saxon St. Etheldreda ( or St. Audrey , whence the word tawdry ) , are still nominally run by the Bishop of Ely . There is not much else for His Lordship to do in Ely ; nearby Cambridge has more religious life , and there the Ely diocesan conferences are held . Yet , because he is a member of the Established Church of England , drawing 4,000 a year ( $16,000 ) from the Government , the Bishop of Ely must live in his ancient see , in a Tudor palace whose whole top floor and one wing are closed . <P> After five years in office , the present ( and 62nd ) Bishop of Ely , Rt . Rev. Dr. Bernard Oliver Francis Heywood , concluded that he would be getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give up the palace . Said the Bishop to his diocesan conference : " The idea that the Church is concerned largely with the upper classes is steadily growing , and I think it is due in part to the fact that we bishops are forced to live in vast houses which are symbols of aloofness . . . . We keep too many gardeners to grow too vegetables to feed too many servants to make too many beds . <P> " I should like to see the palace turned into a home for people fallen on evil days at the end of their lives . If they had ten bob $2 a week-or even less-they could come here and live in a nice house with a common room and a pleasant garden to walk in . ... One can not let a bishop 's palace any more than one can let a vicarage ; that is one of the penalties we pay for Establishment . ... If I were allowed to move into a smaller house I should be better off ... despite the fact that I should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a very long furrow to drive . " Well did His Lordship of Ely realize that there was little hope that his wish would be granted .
