THE kernel of truth in the otherwise misleading formula that East is East and West is West and so forth is that the affairs of the one can not be translated into the terms of the other . Their respective cultural languages differ too widely . If the twain have never been able to meet , as indeed they have not , the reason is mainly that the West has insisted on applying its own standards , conventions , and beliefs , and then on making judgments . We are a politically minded people , especially we of the English-speaking nations . We are absorbed in what may be called the public life of a country , in the narrowly restricted events that make up " situations " and " crises . " For us the " problem " of a country consists of its domestic politics and foreign relations . But because such events have other values in the East , and sometimes have no significance at all , our judgments are generally wrong . If we do not misunderstand , we at least fail to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no country is a better illustration of this than China . Knowing of China only what we read in the newspapers or in more pretentious expositions by experts , we see it as an orgy of civil wars , a nullity of law and order , a relapse into comic-opera government , and a crying need for " cleaning up " ? the technical description is " chaos . " Nor is this altogether inaccurate as a description of surface symptoms , of the superficial aspects of the public life of the country . But knowing so much , we know nothing of what is essential in China ; seeing so much , we see distortedly . For what is really happening in China , what is important as history and fundamental in influence , is that a world is turning over . This is happening everywhere in the East , but in China it is brought to sharpest focus . A whole hemisphere seethes , and the revolutions , civil wars , disintegrated governments , nationalist insurgencies , and anti-foreign movements are but the froth at the top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles , and grievous to foreign offices , and sometimes tragic to those immediately affected ; but they are unimportant in themselves . They are symptoms . They are effects , not causes . The truth about China , about the whole East , is much more serious than we think it is , than we are told it is in conventional channels of information . It goes deeper and , moreover , it is something we can not " do anything " about . There is chaos in the East now , not as the word is used in the professional slang of writers on foreign affairs , diplomatic observers , and outraged " men on the spot , " but in its correct sense of formlessness . There is chaos in China because the old principle of order is no longer effective . For twenty-five hundred years China has been held together internally by a crystallized , highly developed , complex , and tenacious civilization , the oldest continuous civilization surviving into our own times and perhaps the most distinctive . For almost a hundred years the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Occidental Powers and the superiority of the white man . China was not conquered in the sense that it had lost entity as a state . But it had lost control over its own destinies and had to do the bidding of others . And it had survived as an entity only because no one of the aggressor Powers was strong enough to absorb it against the opposition of rival Powers , and partition was impracticable because they could never have agreed on division of the spoils . China was saved because the Powers hated one another more than they coveted China . By the gravitational pull of these two forces ? a deeply rooted civilization and the dominance of the white Powers ? China had been kept on its orbit . Both forces have now lost power of attraction . The civilization of China is dead in spirit , crushed by the impact of a civilization of greater vitality , the machine civilization of the West . The historic culture is sterile . The traditions which determined the forms of Chinese society and the ways of living of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of values is no longer accepted . Institutions are shaken . Beliefs no longer carry conviction . Customs are fluid . Even habits , handed down from generation to generation until become almost as unvarying as reflexes , are broken . The cement of the whole Chinese social structure , loosening for a generation , is now suddenly crumbling away . In America we are perplexed by what Walter Lippmann describes as the dissolution of the ancestral order . By comparison ours is a fixity . If we arc groping for certainties , then the Chinese can be said to be stumbling amid ruins , blindly seeking a new path , even a new destination . The dominance of the Western Powers has ended . It has been undermined by the sapping of our own ideas and shattered by explosives of our own laying . Democracy , nationalism , conscious patriotism , later reinforced by self-determination and the rights of weak nations ? all the ideas brought with us in what we magniloquently called our mission to civilize backward peoples ? have donetheir work . We have civilized the backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned how to use the most destructive weapons of modern warfare and acquired the concept of nationalism as an end for which to fight . The restraints which might have served to check them before have ceased to be operative . Western ascendancy was established by force and subsequently rested either directly on force or indirectly on the white man 's prestige , the belief in his superiority , not so much innately as because of his invincibility . That belief has passed irrevocably . We adduced too much evidence to the contrary . The World War was conclusive . We told too much about one another then by way of propaganda , too much that was true . And as if to point the conclusion , we took yellow and brown and black men to the fighting fronts and taught them to kill white men , thus demonstrating that it could be done by men of any color if only the right weapons were used . Prestige having lost its symbol value , only force could sustain our position when the challenge came which the ferment of our ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or psychologically indisposed to resort to force . The Chinese , not alone among Eastern peoples , have taken advantage of the fact . The succession of crises between the Western Powers and China from the Washington Conference to the recent conflict with Russia is the result . In effect the Chinese have won . The details are not important . Whether this treaty or that has been abrogated or not , whether this foreign concession or that has been retroceded or not , the Chinese have recovered in substance most of what had been wrested from them in the long period of subjugation by the West . What is left to us is shadow . Most of all , more than the tangible elements of special privileges , rights , territorial encroachments , and other derogations on sovereignty , the Chinese have recovered a sense of equality . They do not automatically yield to the white man as of a divinely ordered dispensation . At the moment , in fact , they have pushed their sense of equality to the point of self-assertiveness , as might be expected . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee of safe conduct , as I have myself unhappily observed . I have felt the steel of a pirate leader 's gun prodding my throat as his followers ransacked my cabin in the foreigners ' first class of a British ship on the Yangtsze quite as turbulently as they did the coolie quarters below decks . I have felt the sting of his knuckles rapped across my cheek by way of warning if I did not yield up what I had hidden . And by way of example there lay just outside my cabin the body of another American , shot down in as contemptuous indifference to the majesty and punitive power of his government as to the weakness of the government of the Chinese shot down below . As an ironic symbol of the significance of the episode , only thirty minutes ' steaming up the river lay a fleet of British , American , French , and Japanese gunboats , presumably for our protection We on our part have forsworn our conquerors ' airs and now move about with circumspection . The most conclusive proof is our vociferous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only admit Chinese into hotels on their own soil , but too agressively deny that they used to have to enter by the back door , as in fact they did . Too ostentatiously we point to the fact that occasionally a club of foreign export and import managers on Chinese territory permits a Chinese aristocrat and scholar to enter its precincts as a guest and not as a servant . And the Chinese now walk with impunity even in the public park on the Shanghai waterfront , until two years ago sacred from their profanation . Indeed , they walk where they like and do as they like even in the foreigner 's presence , a social revolution the immensity of which can not be appreciated by those who did not know the China of ten years ago when the English or American junior clerk was king and conqueror and god . China will regain equilibrium first in its foreign relations . The basis will be independence . All that remains now is the formality of liquidating the regime of foreign hegemony . Diplomatic bodies are ponderous and move glacially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit is dead and to the outward forms of foreign privileges already nullified in practice . In the realities which the foreign official representative or business man in China must face from day to day , however , the old regime is gone . In time foreign offices , too , will recognize realities , and treaties will be made to conform with them . But that is merely the formality of routine . A chapter in history has closed . Our day of might in the Far East is done . None like it will dawn again in our time . What we originally gained by force we have lost by force and can regain only by force . But we should be dealing now with a different China from that which we subdued in the nineteenth century with a few gunboats and a few regiments of infantry . It is no longer a giant asleep in the past , ignorant of the world and armed with the weapons of the Middle Ages . It has a sense of nationality , is alert to national perils and , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning fast how to fight . Only a real army could reduce China to the position it occupied only twenty years ago , and no Western country could send a real army . For political reasons Japan can not . It would be restrained by Great Britain and America . Our day is done , and I do not count it an unmixed evil . It may have saved us a greater loss than the fruits of conquest . If China had been as near disintegration twenty-five years ago as it is now , we should have speeded the process and then fallen to fighting over the pieces . Even if we did speed the process now the pieces would not be ours anyway . The Chinese can unite long enough to keep the intruder out . When the Western world has recovered from its present exhaustion and , moreover , has evolved a new technic of penetration , a new era of imperialism may set in , but it will not be imperialism in the old terms and it will not be so easy to establish and maintain . it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , however , China may by that time have taken forms that can not be envisaged now and that will preclude even attempts at aggression . What of China internally ? In one of the larger provincial centers only recently I was talking to an old friend , then a member of the provincial central committee , the board of administrators who governed the province . In effect , his was the decisive voice in the committee and the province . I asked him what he thought . " Yes , it is a mess , " he said . " In my heart I know it to be all that the most contemptuous Shanghai foreign business man says it is . But what else could it be ? Look . I was born in a village not far from here . When I was a boy workmen suddenly came along once and started putting up poles and stringing wires between them outside the village walls . I was curious , we all were curious . At first we were fearful of the effect on the spirits of wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father came back from the county market town one day and explained . You could put a letter on those wires and in a day or an hour ? that was not quite clear ? it would arrive at its destination at the other end of the province , just traveling along the wire . I speculated long on that , but if my father said so it was true . Then it occurred to me that New Year was coming . I had a cousin living in a town at some distance , and I had wanted to send him a present . If I could send aletter along those wires , why not also a present ? I got a nice pair of felt shoes and early New Year 's morning I stole outside the city walls , stood under the wires , and flung first one shoe and then another up at them . They hit the wires and came down . I did n't understand . I ran home crying . " And I am still in early middle age and I am supposed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct public utilities , plan irrigation and reclamation schemes , institute scientific farming , regulate the new factories springing up everywhere , think out the labor problem , organize and administer public school systems , and start modern hospitals . That is the adjustment I have had to make in half a lifetime ; it is the adjustment we all have had to make in less than a generation . And , remember , I have had the unusual advantage of having studied in America and traveled in Europe . Most of us have not begun yet . I can take you out on the new automobile road we have built and show you peasants peering into the radiator of an autobus , looking for the concealed animal or spirit that makes it go . Of course we have n't made the adjustment yet . We do n't really understand now , let alone know how to rim this new kind of world . But it is the world we have to live in just the same . Of course , we are making a mess . Do you wonder ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fundamental causes . It is hard also to sum up contemporary China 's address to these causes more succinctly than in the same man 's words . We were walking on the shores of a lake which is hallowed in Chinese legendry . Here in the golden splendors of the T'ang age poets came to sing of its beauties , painters to set them down in swift strokes on silk . Here emperors came to take their ease in pavilions of red beams and green-and-golden tiled roofs built for their pleasure . On the hills which gently rise above it monasteries lie in cool , serene retreat half-hidden in groves of bamboo . About us lay the deposits of the greatness and glory of China 's ancient days . He was telling me of his plans for the " development " of the lake shore ? he used that word . There would be a. library for public use , with classes for the illiterate ; there would be a building for commercial exhibits , and so forth . What kind of buildings would they be ? I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dipping roofs and broad courtyards and winding , shaded paths in old gardens ? They would not , he answered vigorously , decidedly not . Would there be adaptations then from Western style to make them more comfortable and economical of space ? No ; that was chop suey , neither one nor the other . They would be Western , pure Western ? as complete a break with the past as possible . Yes , these that were here now were beautiful . They could never be surpassed . And they embodied the traditions of the race . That was just it ? they tied the race to the past . Above all else , those ties had to be broken . Then he spoke with passionate intensity . " If I thought it were necessary in order to make that break sure , " he said , " I would tear all these down and put up New Jersey factory buildings in their place . " III This is the mood of contemporary China . Now , as distinguished from fifteen or twenty years ago , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young China , showing itself in superficial changes on the outer fringes while the mass of the country went on as always , unaffected and unknowing . Nor does it reflect the hybridism of those ungrounded in their own culture and veneered with a little Western learning , to be patronized or ignored by the educated classes who made opinion and held power of decision . Now it represents the reasoned conviction ofresponsible men , intellectual leaders , and scholars in the old tradition , and it finds expression in a destructiveness that is awesome . A whole race is destroying its foundations . The most conservative race in the world , the most tenacious of its past , is consciously , deliberately demolishing all that it has held sacred , all that stands of a civilization which has endured for three thousand years and builded greatly in its course . What the times began , the Chinese are themselves finishing . If they walk amid ruins , they are also making them as they go . The old educational system has been abandoned . The Confucian classics and the literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosophy , a code of morals , a code of conduct , a text of political and social science , and an intellectual discipline , are no longer being taught . They have simply been dropped . They are not even respected . In Peking there is a school which was founded in the days of the monarchy by a group of wealthy literati for the teaching of the classics to sons of officials . It has always been the custom for the trustees ? usually elderly scholars and officials to attend the opening exercises for the orthodox ceremony of bowing to the tablet of Confucius , a ceremony prescribed through the centuries . Last year they went as usual . There was no tablet above the outer gate . They proceeded into the assembly hall . There the niche above the dais was empty . They made inquiries . The two tablets were found flung into a corner of the courtyard . It is so everywhere . In practically all the schools children are being taught nothing of what their parents learned . Confucius and Mencius are not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stead are " subjects , " a haphazard and ever-changing curriculum , too obviously stemming from the West . It is as if there were suddenly dropped out of our own education everything written before 1900 . A generation is growing up ignorant of the foundations of Chinese thought and without the real basis of any other thought . A generation is growing up cut off also from the foundation of Chinese society , which was the family system ? the family not in our sense of father , mother , and children , but rather father , mother , and sons , the sons ' wives and their children , perhaps three or four generations in collateral branches , all living together under a patriarchate , or at least council of elders . In the larger centers where new ideas have penetrated most deeply the family controls are already so loosened as to be ineffective , and even in the rural regions they are relaxed . And since the family was the agency of government in all personal relations ? law-giver , administration , and court of justice ? there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations , where they manifest themselves more recognizably as political breakdown and civil strife . Authority is no longer recognized . Ancestor worship is no longer the first duty or filial piety the highest virtue . The family is not accepted as the unit in the social scheme , its welfare the sole criterion . The individual is asserting himself and his rights . He refuses to obey the decision of parents or a council of elders as to where he shall live , how he shall occupy himself , what he shall do with his property and , most of all , whom he shall marry . It is the law of the sages and immemorial custom that marriages be arranged by parents through the intricate negotiations of middlemen and that bride and groom neither know each other nor see each other until after the prolonged and elaborate marriage ceremonies , the bride then severing all connection with her own family and entering her husband 's home , where she must render obedience and homage to his mother . Yet it was only an occasion for amusement when a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper : " Why go to all the bother of having a wedding ceremony in the presence of witnesses and with permission of elders ? This is to announce that we are now husband and wife , having been married yesterday . " It is untypical only in the bravado , but not in the sentiment that lies behind it . To the younger generation marriage concerns the individual and not the family and , therefore , personal inclinations alone must be consulted . There is open revolt against the right of parents to choose life partners , and in all the towns there are numerous marriages in defiance of the wish of parents . And to the parents a marriage so contracted is the equivalent of a companionate marriage to an American parent . In result , as always when change is sharp and sudden , there is personal tragedy . Iv As everywhere , the break is most clearly and dramatically manifest in the status of women . Ten years ago I remember one of my Chinese teachers coming to me in Peking in distress . He was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He had been recently married . His wife had gone to a mission school . He had not , but he was progressive , he said . And he had seen how it was between foreigners and their wives . It had come to the ears of his mother , who was old-fashioned , that he had gone with his wife to a mission school party , that he had appeared with her among strangers , and that he had been seen walking home with her . His mother was outraged . Was her daughter-in-law a prostitute ? Did a gentleman parade in public with his wife as if he were a peasant and watch her talking to strange men as if she were a sing-song girl ? Thus his mother ; but his wife was equally outraged . Was he modern or not ? Had he learned anything or not ? And was he to be one of the " old heads " ? She for her part would not be . For his part , woe was his portion . For his mother said quite rightly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcast . His wife said equally rightly that he owed fidelity to his education and beliefs , to say nothing of her . " How fortunate you foreigners are , " he said . " Your lives are so simple . " I had lived in China five years and had numerous Chinese friends , many of them intimate friends . I had seen the wives of only three of them . When I last returned to China in 1927 I had been away for some years . The night after my arrival I was invited to a Chinese party in one of the new swagger hotels in Shanghai . As I entered I stood rooted , brought up by the shock of a picture framed in a distant doorway . There I saw women ? Chinese women ? and dancing . Dancing with men , and men not their husbands ! And I thought of my Peking teacher only a few years before . No doubt there are mothers who still ask whether their daughters-in-law are to act like prostitutes , but one also sees them with their daughters at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even pathetically striving to seem modern themselves ? their hair bobbed , the ends of their long shoes stuffed out with cotton to conceal the fact that they have bound feet . One also hears of marriages in which the bride stipulates that the bridegroom pledge himself never to take a concubine . On the other hand , I know of a case in which the wife , an American-educated woman and modern , finding herself barren , has insisted , against his objections , that her husband exercise his prerogative of taking a concubine in order to carry on his line , and has herself gone out to choose him one . While it is true that the " new woman " is now something more than a showpiece to be celebrated in foreign feature articles about " awakening " and " enlightenment , " the past still survives . Precisely because it does , and because there coexist two entirely different and mutually exclusive sets of mores , life in China is something more than picturesque . It is also prolific of pain . For instincts do not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For many conform and willingly ; and , with conforming , hurt . There is also reason . When one system of controls is abandoned , presumably for another , there is always a hiatus between the two . In the interval before the new one is understood and adjusted there is a vast deal of human wastage , especially when the old restraints have been rigid and unyielding . More particularly have young Chinese women in large cities a caricatured idea of the freedom of Western women . The younger generation may seem a problem to the American parent . By comparison the Chinese may still wistfully envy us the simplicity of our life . The breakdown of the Chinese family , which is to say the breakdown of all standards , is not just a matter of modernism or the acceptance of ideas . It is only partly conscious . New forms of production have dictated new ways of living , regardless of intellectual conviction or choice . The factory worker follows his job . Industrialism means concentration of labor supply where production is most economical . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all work together . So can the worker in household industry , whose family provides artisan , apprentice , bookkeeper , and clerk , and whose radius of operation is the immediate neighborhood . In China , as in England one hundred years ago , new industrial centers create new population centers . The worker is willy-nilly broken from the old discipline , physically broken because he no longer lives at home and psychologically because he has to form new habits . What happens is that one body of sanctions is gone before another can be formed . V Essentially China is in vacuum now . One may almost say there is no China . The China that was has passed or is passing . Away from the centers of dissolution there are vestiges of the old China , outwardly as they always have been but inwardly without life . What is in China to-day the mind can not grasp because the eye can form no image . It shifts too rapidly for focus . The China that will be can not even be envisaged . Dim foreshadowings of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form an outline . Can a race have two lives ? Can any people have a rebirth ? Can it detach itself from the civilization in which its spirit has been poured , tear itself up by the roots , roots gnarled in the soil for three thousand years , then bear fruit again in another civilization ? No race ever has . All others that have decayed once have survived only as wraiths among their memories . There is evidence that already iu the T'ang dynasty , more than a thousand years ago , the Chinese were old and weary , overrefined and disillusioned , oppressed by the futility of effort and the vanity of all things earthly . It may be that China 's easy subjection in the last century and its present disintegration are proof that its vitality is irrecoverably spent . On the other hand , Chinese history has always moved in cycles , and this may have been only the under-swing of the curve . The Chinese have dropped as low as this before , and always emerged . Their very survival in the last hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enervated . The ability of their emigrants to venture into all parts of theworld from the arctic north to the equatorial tropics and everywhere to establish themselves securely or even to dominate in fair competition is further evidence . At any rate China has entered a new phase . In can never go back . It may survive only biologically ? so many individuals of certain physical characteristics , but dead in spirit and a prey to conquest . It may be merely an imitation of the industrialized West , Western in exterior , in all except the dynamic vigor of the West ? its historic identity entirely lost . Or , it may take over Western science and the machine technology and make them its own , combine the power of mechanization with its old creativeness , acquire the West 's command over nature while remaining Chinese in spirit . If so , with its vast area , its resources , its population of one quarter of the human race , and the qualities which before have made it a dominant empire , will it be the most powerful nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie the key to the future of more than one continent . This , then , is the real problem of China , not that which occupies the minds of diplomats . And it is more interesting , more dramatic , and more important . The chaos of China is the breaking of a civilization , not that which figures in news of political intrigues and civil wars ; and it is more serious .
