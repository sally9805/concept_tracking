Pardon Us ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) is the first full-length comedy made by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy . Hopelessly in effectual in all their doings , they are particularly and painfully inefficient in this picture . First shown planning to manufacture homebrew , they are next seen being sentenced to prison because of their clumsiness . Added to the basic handicap of the Laurel face - blank , ugly , absurd - is the handicap in Pardon Us of a loose tooth which causes him to punctuate all his sentences with a vulgar and sarcastic noise . <P> These noises , perpetrated at inopportune moments , cause Laurel and Hardy to be persecuted by their jailers and fellow prisoners . When they escape from prison and , wearing blackface , take to working in a cottonfield , Laurel 's impolite articulations cause their disguises to be penetrated . <P> Returned to jail , Laurel &; Hardy attempt to take part in a jailbreak . But so muddled are their efforts that they aid the authorities more than the inmates and are rewarded by a pardon . <P> Screen comedians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-reel feature films . Funnymen Laurel &; Hardy emerge from the crisis as funny as ever but no funnier . Their incapacities , hilarious in earlier and briefer studies , seem protracted in Pardon Us : they have added nothing to their formula except vulgarity . Funny shots : Laurel &; Hardy making friends with the bloodhounds which have been sent to trail them ; sing ing " Good morning , dear teacher , " in the prison school ; going to bed in the same cot so awkwardly that they break the cot . <P> Stanley Laurel and Oliver Hardy use their own names for the characters whom they impersonate in their pictures .

When Mack Sennett saw Charlie Chaplin and Chaplin left the company to go into cinema , Laurel considered him " a fool for leaving .

In 1927 , also , he met Stan Laurel . They formed an immediate partnership , now have a song about it : " Ham &; Eggs , Salt &; Pepper , Bread &; Butter , Laurel &; Hardy , United we stand-divided we flop . " <P> An expert golfer , Funnyman Hardy has won 24 cups and two gold medals ; nonetheless , he is fat and soft-looking . Laurel is thin and pale , speaks with a low-grade London accent . Funnyman Laurel seems to be the more stupid of the two , but not by very much . In Pardon Us , the teacher in the prison school asks him how many times 3 goes into 9 .
