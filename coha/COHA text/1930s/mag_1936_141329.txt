In bed at 10 o'clock one night last week Farmer George Behlmann , who lives three miles north of the St. Louis Airport , heard an airplane overhead . Said he next day : <P> " The motor sounded very loud and suddenly stopped . My wife said , ' That 's funny . I wonder if it crashed . ' ... I dressed and went out . Other people whom I met said the plane had crashed . It was very foggy and I could n't see 20 feet ahead of me ... so I went back to bed . " Had he pushed on to the boundaries of his farm , George Behlmann would have come upon the scene of the third wreck of a U. S. airliner in 1936 . <P> Just three months old , the twin-motored , ten-passenger Lockheed-Electra City of Memphis was on its regular run from New Orleans to Chicago , Chicago &; Southern Air-Lines ' sole route . At St. Louis , motors and controls were examined , found perfect . After getting a weather report which noted a 2,000-ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unlimited visibility at Chicago , the City of Memphis had soared off into the dark at 9:56 p. m. with a fresh pilot , a copilot , six passengers . One of the latter was Captain Vernon C. Omlie , oldtime flyer and husband of equally famed Aviator Phoebe Omlie . Six minutes after the takeoff , the airport called the plane by radio , got no answer By 10:20 , when there was still no word anxious officials began querying airport ; along the way . <P> It was three hours before the shattered City of Memphis was found . Then ground crew stumbled on an isolated clearing on the Behlmann farm , found 400-ft. swath through the corn strewn with the wreckage of the $50,000 all-metal plane . Scattered among the debris were the bodies of the eight victims , all killed instantly . The pilot 's watch had stopped at 10:02 p. m . <P> With dawn , Air Commerce officials speedily reconstructed the accident . For some unknown reason , the pilot had apparently decided to return to the airport , banked sharply to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maneuver , the wingtip caught in a ditch , tripped the plane into a cartwheel . At the last instant , the pilot cut the switch , prevented fire . The retracted position of the landing gear showed that he was not attempting to land . <P> How to explain all these circumstances , as usual , baffled everyone . After a week of investigation by Air Commerce Director Eugene L. Vidal himself , no one had produced a better explanation than Chicago &; Southern 's President Carleton Putnam . Numbed by the first fatal accident in his company 's three-year history , he groaned : " It was one of those things that ca n't happen but still did . "
