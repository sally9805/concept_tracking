THE President is very pessimistic about the entire situation , and is inclined to credit reports which various people have brought back from Europe , that nothing but a miracle can head off a world catastrophe . The possibility of some last minute move by the United States to head off a showdown is not entirely out of the question , though still in the nebulous state . " This fragment from the Washington MerryGo-Round column comes just as we go to press and is similar in implication to other rumors coming from Washington over a period of many months . These rumors follow the same general theme . If the reader will turn back to HARPER 'S for May , 1938 , he will find in Hubert Herring 's article , " Where Arc You Going , Mr. President ? " the trend of the Administration 's foreign policy carefully traced . The nub of that article ? and of the situation ? is this : Foreign policy is one thing ; defense is another . They might coincide , but they do n't . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on October 5 , 1937 . The President there said that the ninety per cent of the peoples of the earth who are minded " to live in peace under law and in accordance with moral standards " must unite in " concerted effort in opposition to those violations of treaties , to those ignorings of humane instincts which to-day are creating a state of international anarchy and instability from which there is no escape through mere isolation or neutrality , " and that the righteous democratic nations must " quarantine " the autocracies , seeking " some way to make their will prevail . " On the 10th of January following , the Ludlow Resolution , providing for a national referendum before any declaration of war except in case of invasion , was defeated in the House by the very close vote of 209 to 188 . Great pressure was exerted by the Administration to achieve this defeat . Since then our foreign policy down to the recent blow-up over whether the President did or did not say that " our frontier is in France " has followed the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung with smoke . Uncertainty about anything is the order of the day both at home and abroad . In this confusion , what are we to believe and do ? Instead of a single leading article this month HARPER 's brackets together three very different articles which in various ways touch our present predicament . The first , " Wanted : A Sane Defense Policy " by Oswald Garrison . Villard , asks a number of specific questions about what " defense " actually may be . The second , " No More Excursions " by C. Hartley Grattan , advocates a specific foreign policy . " Courage for To-morrow " by Avis D. Carlson is an essay directed to the citizen who is now discovering that a lot of his yardsticks and bench-marks are n't good for much these days ? and the number of such citizens is large . Mr. Villard , one of the best-known of American journalists , was the president and editorial writer for the New York Evening Post from 1897 until 1918 , when he sold the paper . From 1918 until 1932 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and until 1935 he served on the editorial board of the same magazine and still contributes to it . He has written many books , among them a notable biography of John Brown , and Germany Embattled , Newspapers and Newspaper Men , Prophets True and False , and The German Phoenix . Recently he has been at work on his autobiography ; it should be in print about the time this issue of the Magazine reaches the reader . Mr. Grattan 's article recalls at once his book Why If e Fought , which suffered the fate of many pioneer works ? few people read it . It is worth while tracing the course of investigation that followed the World War and the Peace Conference . There were plenty of observers and participants in the Peace Conference who had no confidence whatever inwhat was done there . One of these persons was John Maynard Keynes and in 1920 there appeared his The Economic Consequences of the Peace . He believed them to be dire and time has proved them so . At that time the image of the Kaiser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legend of the Huns still in fairly good shape . But it was not long before the diggers were busy investigating the claims of the Allies to unblemished virtue . ( Americans were sick of the War and in 1920 the G.O.P. elephant was cartooned carrying a flag lettered : " Lafayette , we have quit . " ) The publication of the Allied secret treaties pushed this disillusion farther and belief in the " war guilt " of the Germans began to cave in . Shortly after the Peace Charles A. Beard was inspecting the newly opened archives in Vienna , Berlin , and Petrograd and by 1922 was lecturing at Dartmouth on the question of war guilt . His book Cross Currents in Europe To-day , published in the same year , dealt with the question . Others were engaged in the same task . In 1927 there appeared Harry Elmer Barnes 's The Genesis of the World War and Harold Lasswell 's Propaganda Technique in the World War . By the time Sidney B. Fay had published his Origins of the World War in 1928 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protagonists were all found knee deep in " guilt , " so the Germans got a reprieve . Then in November , 1929 , at the moment when the stock market was rocking under the crash , Grattan 's Wly We Fought appeared . By now investigation had veered around . The question was , how did it happen that we got sucked into the War ? After reviewing the causes of the outbreak of the War , the war-guilt theory , and the propaganda technics , Mr. Grattan presented a documented study of the development of the enormous economic stake ? the private loans , the trade in munitions and commodities ? which numerous Americans had in Allied victory . This knocked the slats out of Saving the World for Democracy and further studies ? those of Professor Seymour , Walter Millis , and Bernadotte Schmitt ? in one way or another made more revelations . The climax to all this came with the Nye Investigation . For a time interest in this investigation was at fever heat . But at that very moment the Nazis had captured the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made the more terrifying by the Reichstag fire and the Blood PERSONAL AND OTHERWISE Purge of.June , 1934 . From that time on until now the alarm bells have been ringing and the question of American participation in another European war raised more and more often . Mr. Grattan 's most recent HARPER article ? and one which received wide attention , was a study of unemployment called " Back to Work : When and Where ? " This appeared in January , 1937 . Shortly after the article was written , Mr. Grattan was given a grant by the Carnegie Corporation and set out to spend two years in Australia studying the social , political , and economic organization of that commonwealth . He returned to the United States a few weeks ago . Mrs. Carlson , the author of " Courage for To-morrow , " lives in Kansas . Shc has written many articles for HARPER 'S , most of them dealing with problems of her own region . " Dust Blowing , " " Drowning in Oil , " and " The Wheat Farmer 's Dilemma " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was called " Crippled in the Tongue " and the other , " The Doctors Face Revolt , " dealt with the question of " Socialized Medicine . " CHEZ NAZI W IIEN Kay Boyle 's story , " The White Horses of Vienna " was published in the April HARPER 'S , 1935 , Hitler had been in power for just two years . That story told , in an oblique way , of Nazi repercussions in a little Tyrolean backwater . Miss Boyle 's story in this issue , " Anschluss , " is told after the taking over of Austria in 193R . The very quiet of the story makes its bite like serpent 's teeth . Miss Boyle has been living in Europe since 1922 . She was born in St. Paul in 1903 ; her father a lawyer and her mother a political radical , and member of the Farmer-Labor Party . For several years before her first marriage Miss Boyle studied music and architecture , a fact which possibly accounts , in part , for the meticulous care with which her stories are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARPER 'S " How Bridie 's Girl Was Won " was the last one ? and she has written six novels : Plagued by the Nightingale ; Year Before Last ; Gentlemen , I Address You Privately ; My Next Bride ; Death of a Man , and Monday Night . Her short stories have been gathered into two volumes . Dickson Skinner 's " Music Goes Into Mass Production " ends with this quotation from Hendrik van Loon : " Culturally Europe is finished . If any more great novels are written ? or great plays , great music , great histories ? they will be written in America . The torch has been passed into our hands . " The phrase " a change in the intellectual climate " has become familiar in the past few years and it is shown clearly in the arts . If we do not have in the United States to-day superlatively great painters as we have great men in the sciences , we have more good painters than we have ever had , and the same is true in music . To put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached a point where there are many competent and more than competent practitioners in them . If this is the state of things in which great practitioners in the arts appear , then we may expect them shortly . What sort of music they will compose no one knows , but that the compositions of American composers are being performed more and more frequently is true . The great original contribution of Americans to the music of the world is jazz , and it flourishes as never before . But composition proceeds apace in " serious " music as well . Here are a handful of American composers whose works have received attention during the past three years . Robert Russell Bennett : works performed by the NBC Symphony , Philadelphia Orchestra , Illinois Symphony , Columbia Broadcasting Symphony , and other organizations . Aaron Copland : no less than twenty-one compositions ? songs , symphonies , play-operas , motets ? performed in the United States and Mexico . Henry Cowell : fourteen compositions , including several composed for Martha . Graham , the dancer , and others receiving the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : six compositions including a symphony , a string quartet , a concerto , and a sonata as well as other works , all new and all performed for the first time since May , 1937 . Roy Harris : seventeen works ; Otto Luening : eight works ; Quinto Maganini : seven works ; William Grant Still : thirteen works . There are many more who could be enumerated . The compositions of these persons have been performed and in many cases their works published and recorded . Mr. Skinner is a lawyer who abandoned his practice to write . His interest in music hasbeen constant since he learned to play the pipe organ during his school days at Princeton . He has written for various periodicals and is the author of a novel called Barbarian . SIBERIA CC WLIEN Grandfather Ran Off with the Tartar Girl " is the second of two pieces by Nicholas Kalashnikoff . The first , " Efim and the Tartar Horses , " appeared last month . Both are from a novel , They That Take the Sword , to be published by Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great irrationality of Jew hatred is flourishing . After the World War , in a wrecked and tormented Europe , hatred of the Jews was let loose ; it became the most powerful text in Hitler 's gospel . With the onset of the World Depression this hatred was seized upon by ambitious politicians and demagogues . In the United States Father Coughlin is now printing once more the long since exploded Protocols of the Elders of Zion . What are the charges most commonly brought against the Jews ? In " Some Facts About Jews " Rabbi Philip S. Bernstein of the Temple B'rith Kodesh of Rochester , New York , enumerates the charges and then presents the statistical evidence , drawn from sources open to anyone , that disproves them . Rabbi Bernstein wrote two articles for us some years ago , both dealing with the Jewish question . JINX F H. Rowsome 's " The Strange Story of the Great Eastern " is the result of an exploration into one of the backwaters of 19th century history . Mr. Rowsome graduated from Harvard College in 1935 and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teacher , and editor , first of a sportsmen 's magazine and then of a building superintendent 's journal . The sports magazine folded after the second issue , the author says , and the journal for janitors never got beyond Volume 1 , Number 1 . This is Mr. Rowsome 's first published article outside of his work for the two magazines . The two men chiefly concerned in the construction of the Great Eastern , Brunel the engineer and Russell the shipbuilder , were both something of international characters . Brunel 's father , an engineer also , before a distinguished career in England was chief engineer of New York , designed the original Bowery Theater and was the successful competitor with his designs for a capitol building at Washington . The plans were later abandoned on grounds of economy . Later , in England and on the Continent , he built bridges and tunnels , invented knitting machines and stereotype plates , and experimented with steam navigation . His son , the designer of the Great Eastern , built railways in England and Italy , achieved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a successful marine architect before the day of his Jonah ship . Russell , the shipbuilder , was a scientist of wide reputation and had previously been Professor of Natural Philosophy at the - University of Edinburgh . A successful builder , he found time to be chief promoter of the Great Exhibition of 1851 the famous Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire only last year ? and was involved in scores of different engineering and architectural projects . But all the reputation and distinction in the world could not save the Great Eastern , and her failure blasted the careers of both men . S.AS THE LAW IS THE TRUE EMBODIMENT OF EVERYTHING THAT 'S EXCELLENT ... " F there is a word in our tongue that is almost I certain to provoke a sour remark or a curse that word is " lawyer . " In " Henry VI " Shakespeare makes Jack Cade 's follower say : " The first thing we do , let 's kill all the lawyers . " Dr. Samuel Johnson , who was anything but a leveller , took no greater pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the fell attorney prowls for prey . " According to Poor Richard , " A countryman between two lawyers is like a fish between two cats . " What is the reason for this ? In the December number Ferdinand Lundberg began a series of articles which proposed to plunge into the jungles of the law and try to find out about the lawyers . The first article was called " The Legal Profession . " Now comes the second , " The Priesthood of the Law , " in which the theological aspects of the profession are examined . " Law Factories " is to be the third in the series and we hope to print it next month . The letters received following the publication of the first article show that the lawyers themselves are not completely satisfied with their calling . Here 's some comment from a counsellor practicing in Idaho : Consider the legal profession as we have it to-day as a parasitic growth on society . Am of the opinion that no paid advocates should be allowed in a court . Adopt the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be far less likely to commit reversible error , if he called in each litigant and got his story and questioned such witnesses as either side could produce and then went to the books and studied out the legal principles applicable to the facts , than he is when a battery of high priced lawyers on each side are attempting to " throw dust in his eyes " and cause him to commit reversible error . Especially when they feel that they can not win before a jury and hope to wear out their opponents by obtaining a new trial or reversal on appeal . However , am fearful , that if this idea were adopted , the arrogance of judges would know no bounds . For a number of years Mr. Lundberg was a newspaper man in Chicago and New York . In 1934 he quit the New York Herald-Tribune , where he had been a member of the Wall Street staff , and set to work on his biography of William Randolph Hearst . Both this work and the volume that followed a year later in 1937 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of commendation and vituperative criticism . DEEP AS HELL W ENNER how , in the early days of the depression , the newspapers and magazines were full of demands for a national " inventory " ? The argument was that it was impossible to figure out a policy for our economy if we did n't know what we had . For a score of different reasons this inventory taking has been going on apace . Here is another entry for the record , " Hell 's Canyon , the Biggest of All , " How many of our readers have ever heard of Hell 's Canyon and how many knew it was the deepest canyon in North America ? It may be the deepest canyon in the world , but no one knows . A letter from the author , Richard Neuberger , has just come in quoting Dr. Freeman of the American Geographical Society to the effect that there may be deeper canyons in the Himalayas . But no one knows , " One of the main arguments for a Hell 's Canyon National Park , " says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the outlying ramparts of the mountains are violently apposed to it . They now practically have carte blanche to graze the slopes bare and strip the timbered hollows clean . National Park boundaries would push them out of the foothills . " The photograph , taken a mile above the river , shows the canyon where it opens up at Hat Point . Mr. Neuberger is political reporter for the Portland Oregonian . His beat takes him through Oregon , Washington , Idaho , and Montana , and along with his political reporting he has been diligent in contributing to the inventory referred to . Readers will recall his story on the Grand Coulee Dam called " Biggest Thing on Earth " which appeared in HARPER 'S in February , 1937 . Getting the Pacific Northwest into print has been a slow process , as any regional bibliography will show . When Hubert Howe Bancroft in the ' 60s laid out the plans for his History of the Pacific States , the Northwest was included and from time to time since then volumes have appeared , but the list has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his Our Promised Land , published last fall .

But being not dead , he speaks . " On Not Being Dead , As Reported " is his philosophical footnote to the disaster . It is not known whether or not the Nazi government saw those reports of Mr. Davis 's death . If they did they must have concluded that a dead hand may be as powerful as a live one , for when the copies of the December number which contained Mr. Davis 's and Mr. Woodside 's articles on the Munich crisis reached Germany , they were instantly suppressed . Mr. Davis has written so many articles for HARPER 'S that it would take almost a page to list them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most readers could repeat it with their eyes shut .

Part II is called " On the Flying Trapeze " and is an exposition of Mr. Hutchins 's ideas about education . This brings the total of HARPER articles dealing with Mr. Hutchins or his ideas up to six in all , None of our readers can plead ignorance now . The list includes two by President Hutchins himself , two by educators who oppose him , and now two by Mr. Mayer who has a part time connection with the University of Chicago .
