YEARLING THE YEARLING " Do n't bother him , " Penny said . " I suspected him all along . There 's dogs is bear-dogs and there 's dogs jest is n't bear-dogs . " The feist dropped in at the end of the line . Jody tried to break trail , but fallen trees lay , thicker than his body , and would not be stirred . Bull-briers , tougher than his father 's muscles , snared him , and he could only push his way around them or crawl beneath . Penny with his burden had to shift for himself . The swamp was close and humid . Rip was panting . The pancakes lay soothingly in Jody 's belly . He reached in the knapsack for the sweet potato pone . His father refused his share and Jody divided it with Rip . The little feist. , he thought , deserved nothing . It was good to clear the swamp at last and come into the open pine woods . Even the scrub that followed after for a mile or two , seemed light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrub palmettos , the gallberry bushes and the ti-ti , was less laborious than crossing the swamp . It was late afternoon when the high pines of Baxter 's Island showed ahead . The procession filed down the sand road from the east and into the clearing . Rip and Perk ran ahead to the hollowed cypress watering trough kept for the chickens . Ma Baxter sat rocking on the narrow veranda , a mound of mending in her lap . " A dead dog and no bear , eh ? " she called . " Not dead yit . Git me water and rags and the big needle and thread . " She rose quickly to help . Jody was always amazed at the capabilityof her great frame and hands when there was trouble . Penny laid old Julia down on the veranda floor . She whimpered . Jody bent to stroke her head and she bared her teeth at him . He trailed his mother disconsolately . She was tearing an old apron into strips . " You kin fetch the water , " she told him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veranda with an armful of crocus sacks to make a bed for the hound . Ma Baxter brought the surgical equipment . Penny unwrapped his blood-soaked shirt from the dog and bathed the deep gashes . Old Julia made no protest . She had known claws before . He sewed the two deepestcuts and rubbed pine gum into all of them . She yelped once and then was silent as he worked . A rib , he said , was broken . He could do nothing for that , but if she lived , it would mend . She had lost much blood . Her breath came short . Penny gathered her up , bed and all . Ma Baxter demanded , " Now where you carryin ' her ? " " To the bedroom . I got to watch her tonight . " " Not to my bedroom , Ezra Baxter . I 'll do for her what 's got to be done , but I 'll not have you poppin ' in and outen the bed all night , wakin ' me . I did n't half sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jody and bed Julia there , " he said . " I 'll not leave her alone in no shed tonight . Fetch me cold water , Jody . " He carried her to Jody 's room and laid her in the corner on the pile of sacking . She would not drink , or could not , and he opened her mouth and poured water down her dry throat . " Leave her rest now . We 'll go do our chores . " The clearing possessed this evening a strange coziness . Jody gathered the eggs from the hay-mow , milked the cow and turned the calf in to her , and cut wood for his mother . Penny , as always , went to the sink-hole with a wooden ox-yoke supportingtwo wooden buckets over his thin shoulders . Ma Baxtercooked supper of poke-greens and dried cow-peas . She fried a frugal slice of the fresh pork . " A piece o ' bear meat ' d go mighty good tonight , " she lamented . Jody was hungry but Penny had little appetite . He left the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma Baxter rose heavily to clear the table and wash the dishes . She askedTHE YEARLINGfor no details of the hunt . Jody longed to talk of it , to cast away the spell of the tracking , and the fight , and the fear that had struck him . Penny was silent . No one noticed the boy and he dipped deeply into the dish of cow-peas . The sun set red and clear . Shadows lay long and black in the Baxter kitchen . Penny said , " I 'm wore out . I could do with bed . " Jody 's feet were raw and blistered from the cowhide shoes . " Me , too , " he said . " I 'll set up a whiles , " Ma Baxter said . " I ai n't done much today , excusin ' fret and worry , and mess with the sausage . " Penny and Jody went to their room . They undressed on the side of the narrow bed . " Now if you was big as your Ma , " Penny said , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . " There was room enough for the two thin bony bodies . The red faded from the west and the room was dusky . The hound slept and whimpered in her sleep . The moon rose , an hour past the full , and the small room lay in a silver brightness . Jody 's feet burned . His knees twitched . Penny said , " You wakeful , son ? " " I cai n't stop walkin ' . " " We went a fur piece . How you like bear-huntin ' , boy ? " " Well  --  " He rubbed his knees . " I like thinkin ' about it . " " I know . " " I liked the trackin ' and the trailin ' . I liked seein ' the saplin'sbroke down , and the ferns in the swamp . " " I know . " " I liked old Julia bayin ' now and agin " " But the fightin 's right fearsome , ai n't it , son ? " " Hit 's mighty fearsome . " " Hit 's sickenin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . And son , you ai n't never seed a bear kilt . But mean as they be , hit 's someway piteeful when they go down and the dogs tears42THE YEARLINGtheir throats and they cry out jest like a person , and lay down and die before you . " Father and son lay in silence . " If the wild creeturs 'd only leave us be , " Penny said . " I wisht we could kill ' em all off , " Jody said . " Them that steals often us and does us harm . " " ' Tai n't stealin ' , in a creetur . A creetur 's got his livin ' to make and he makes it the best way he kin . Same as us . Hit 's panther nature and wolf nature and bear nature to kill their meat . County lines is nothin ' to them , nor a man 's fences . How 's a creetur to know the land 's mine and paid for ? How 's a bear to know I 'm dependin ' on my hogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's hongry . " Jody lay staring into the brightness . Baxter 's Island seemed to him a fortress ringed around with hunger . Now in the moonlight eyes were shining , red and green and yellow . The hungry would dart in to the clearing in swift forays , and kill and eat and slink away again . Pole-cats and ' possums would raid the hen-roost , wolf or panther might slay the calf before daylight , old Slewfoot might come again to murder and feed . " A creetur 's only doin ' the same as me when I go huntin ' us meat , " Penny said . " Huntin ' him where he lives and beds and raises his young uns . Hit 's a hard law , but it 's the law . Kill or go hongry . " Yet the clearing was safe . The creatures came , but they went away again . Jody began to shiver and could not tell why . " You cold , son ? " " I reckon . " He saw old Slewfoot wheel , and slash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught and crushed , and hold on , andthen fall away , broken and bleeding . But the clearing was safe . " Move close , son . I 'll warm you . " He edged closer to his father 's bones and sinews . Penny slipped an arm around him and he lay close against the lank43THE YEARLINGthigh . His father was the core of safety . His father swam the swift creek to fetch back his wounded dog . The clearing was safe , and his father fought for it , and for his own . A sense of snugness came over him and he dropped asleep . He awakened once , disturbed . Penny was crouched in the corner in the moonlight , ministering to the hound.  --  5  --  PENNY said at breakfast , " Well , it 's trade for a new gun , or court trouble . " Old Julia was better . Her wounds were clean , without swelling . She was exhausted from loss of blood and wanted only to sleep . She had lapped a little milk from the gourd Penny held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new gun , " Ma Baxter asked , " and not money scarcely for taxes ? " " I said trade ' , " Penny corrected . " Ary day you git the best of a trade , I 'll eat my wash-pot . " " Now Ma , I would n't even crave to beat a man . But there 's trades where all is satisfied . " " What you got to trade with ? " " The feist. 45THE YEARLING it THE YEARLING " Who 'd have him ? " " He 's a good ketch-dog . " " Good to ketch biscuits . " " You know as good as I do , the Forresters is fools for dogs . " " Ezra Baxter , do you go tradin ' with the Forresters , you 'll do good to come home wearin ' your breeches . " " Well , that 's where me and Jody is headin ' for , today . " Penny spoke with a firmness against which the bulk of his wife was sheer air . She sighed . " All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me water or care do I drop in my tracks . Go . Take him . " " I ai n't never left you without wood nor water . " Jody listened anxiously . He would rather visit the Forrestersthan eat . " Jody has got to mix with men and learn the ways o ' men , " Penny said . " The Forresters ' is a fine place to begin . Do he learn from them , he 'll learn to have a heart as black as midnight . " " He might learn from them , not to . Anyways , that 's where we 're goin ' . " He rose from the table . " I 'll fetch water and Jody , you go split a good bait o ' wood . " " You want to tote lunch ? " she called after him . " I 'd not insult my neighbors that-a-way . We 'll noon with them . " Jody hurried to the wood-pile . Every blow of the axe on the fat pine brought him closer to the Forresters and his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen to fill his mother 's wood-box . His father had not yet returned from the sink-hole with his load of water . Jody hurried to the lot and saddled the horse . If the horse were ready and waiting , they might get off before his mother discoveredsome fresh pretext for detaining him . He saw Penny coming down the sand road from the west , bowed under the46ox-yoke with the two heavy wooden buckets brimming with water . He ran to help him ease the load to the ground , for a lack of balance would tumble the buckets headlong , and the tedious hauling would have to be done all over again . " Cxsar 's saddled , " he said . " And the woods is a-fire , I take it . " Penny grinned . " All right . Leave me put on my tradin ' coat and tie up Rip and git my gun and we 're long gone . " The saddle had been bought of the Forresters , having proved a trifle small for any of their great frames . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , son . But do you keep out-growin ' me , you 'll be obliged to ride behind , for I cai n't see the road before me . Here , Perk ! Heel up . " The feist fell in behind . He stopped once and looked back over his shoulder . " I hope it 's your last look , " Penny told him . Cxsar , well rested , went into a steady trot . His old back was broad , the saddle was wide , and riding so , with his father braced behind him , was as comfortable , Jody thought , as a rocking chair . The sand road was a sunny ribbon , leafshadowed . West , by the sink-hole , the road forked , one branch continuing on to Forresters ' Island , the other turning north . Ancient axe-marks on venerable long-leaf pines blazed the turn to the northerly trail . " Did you or the Forresters make them blazes ? " Jody asked . " Them was cut before me and the Forresters was ever heered tell of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them pines grows so slow , I 'd not be surprised was some of ' em Spanish blazes . That teacher never learned you no history last year ? Why , boy , the Spaniards made this trail . This right here , that we 're leavin ' now , is the old Spanish trail clear acrost Floridy . It split back near Fort Butler . The south un goes to Tampa . Hit 's the Dragoon trail . This un here 's the Black Bear . " 47Pages 48 , 49 deletedTHE YEARLINGMa Forrester swooped after the dogs and they scattered into the forest . " Penny Baxter ! Jody ! Git down and come in ! " Jody dropped to the ground and she thumped him on the back . She smelled of snuff and of wood-smoke . The odor did not offend him but he was obliged to think of the delicate sweet scent of Grandma Hutto . Penny dismounted . He held the feist tenderly . The Forresters milled about him . Buck led the horse away to the corral . Mill-wheel caught Jody up and swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he swung a puppy . Beyond , down the cabin steps , Jody saw Fodder-wing hurryingtoward him . The humped and twisted body moved in a series of contortions , like a wounded ape . Fodder-wing lifted his walking stick and waved it . Jody ran to meet him . Fodderwing'sface was luminous . He cried , " Jody ! " They stood , embarrassed and delighted . A sense of pleasure came over Jody that he felt with no one else . His friend 's body was no more unnatural to him than the body of a chameleon or a ' possum . He took the word of grown folks that Fodder-wing was witless . He himself would have known better than to do the thing that had given Fodderwinghis name . The youngest Forrester had conceived the idea that if he could attach himself to something light and airy , he could float from the roof-tree of the barn as gently as any bird . He had attached great bundles of fodder , cow-pea hay , to his arms , and jumped . He had survived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hunch-backed frame with which he had been born . It was a crazy thing to do , of course . Yet privately , Jody felt , something of the sort might work . He had , himself , often thought of kites , very large kites . And some secret understanding was his of the crippled5oTHE YEARLINGboy 's longing for flight ; for lightness ; for a moment 's freedom from his body , earth-bound and bent and stumbling . He said , " Hey . " Fodder-wing said , " I got a baby ' coon . " He had , always , a new pet . " Le 's go see it . " Fodder-wing led him back of the cabin to a collection of boxes and cages that sheltered his changing assortment of birds and creatures . " My eagle died , " Fodder-wing said . " He was too wild to pen . " The pair of black swamp rabbits was not new . " They wo n't raise no young uns , " Fodder-wing complained . " I 'm fixin ' to turn ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll give him to you , " Fodder-wing offered . " I kin git me another . " Jody 's hopes lifted and fell . " Ma wo n't let me keep nothin ' . " His heart swelled , aching for the fox-squirrel . " Here 's the ' coon . Here , Racket ! " A black nose protruded between narrow slats . A tiny black paw , like a baby 's hand , reached out . Fodder-wing lifted a slat and brought out the ' coon . It clung to his arm and gave a strange chirring cry . " You kin hold him . He 'll not bite you . " Jody cuddled the ' coon against him . He thought he had never seen or touched a thing so delightful . The gray fur was as soft as his mother 's outing flannel nightgown . The pointed face was masked across the eyes with a black bar . The bushy tail was beautifully ringed . The ' coon nibbled at his flesh and cried again . " He wants his sugar-teat , " Fodder-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house whilst the dogs is out . He 's mighty skeert o ' the dogs , but he 'll git used to ' em . He do n't like nocommotion . " " What was you-all fightin ' about , " Jody asked , " when wecome up ? " " I was n't into it , " Fodder-wing said with disdain . " It wasthem . " " What was it ? " " One o ' the dogs wet in the middle o ' the floor . Theycould n't agree whose dog ' t was , done it . " THE ' coon sucked greedily at his sugar-teat . He lay on his back , cupped in Jody 's arm , and clutched the sugar-filled cloth with his fore feet . He closed his eyes blissfully . His small paunch was already round with milk and shortly he pushed the sugar-teat away and scrambled to be free . Jody lifted him to his shoulder . The ' coon parted his hair and felt along his neck and ears with his small , restless hands . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forrester spoke from the shadows beyond the hearth . Jody had not noticed him , he sat so quiet . " I had me a ' coon when I were a young un , " he said . " Hit were gentle as a kitten for two yare . Then one day hit bit a chunk outen my shin . " He spat into the fire . " This un 'll grow up to bite . Hit 's ' coon nature . " 52 53THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGMa Forrester came into the cabin and went to her pots and pans . Her sons trooped in behind her ; Buck and Mill-wheel , Gabby and Pack , Arch and Lem . Jody looked puzzled at the dried and wizened pair that had bred these mountainous men . They were all much alike , except Lem and Gabby . Gabby was shorter than the rest and not unduly bright . Lem alone was clean-shaven . He was as tall as any of them , but thinner , and not so dark , and had the least to say . He often sat apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most boisterous , caroused . Penny Baxter came in , lost among them . Pa Forrester continued his discourse on the nature of ' coons . No one listened but Jody , but the old man relished his own words . " That ' coon 'll grow up to where he 's big as a dog . He 'll whop ary dog on the yard . A ' coon lives for one thing , to whop a dog . He 'll lie on his back in the water and fight a hull pack o ' dogs . He 'll drown ' em , one by one . And bite ? A ' coon 'll bite one more time after he 's dead . " Jody was torn between the desire to follow him , and his interestin the talk of the other Forresters . He was surprised to see that his father still carried the worthless feist tenderly in his arms . Penny crossed the room . " Howdy , Mr. Forrester . Proud to see you . How 's your health ? " " Howdy , sir . I 'm right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about done for . Truth to tell , I 'd ought to be dead this minute and gone to glory , but I keep puttin ' it off . Seems like I 'm betteracquainted here . " Ma Forrester said , " Set down , Mr. Baxter . " Penny drew a rocker and sat down . Lem Forrester called across the room , " Your dog lame ? " " Why , no . I 've never knowed him to go lame . I jest figger onkeepin ' him outen the jaws o ' them blood-hounds o ' yourn . " " Valuable , eh ? " Lem asked 54 " Not him . He ai n't wuth a good twist o ' t'baccy . Do n't youallaim to detain him when I leave here , for he 's not wuth stealin ' . " " You takin ' mighty good keer of him , iffen he 's that sorry .

Sorriest bear-dog I ever owned or fol-lered . " Lem said , " I never heered a man run down his own dog that-a-way .

" " You figger on huntin ' some on your way back ? " " Why , a man always has huntin ' in his mind . " " Hit 's mighty quare you toted a dog along would n't be no good to you . " The Forresters looked about at one another . They fell silent . Their black eyes were riveted on the feist . " The dog 's no good and my old muzzle-loadin ' shotgun is no good , " Penny said . " I 'm in a pure fix . " The black eyes darted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung . The array , Jody thought , would stock a gun-shop . The Forresters made good money trading horses , selling venison and making moonshine . They bought guns as other men would buy flour and coffee . " I never heered tell o ' you failin ' to git meat , " Lem said . " I failed yestiddy . My gun would n't shoot and when it did , hit back-fired . " " What was you huntin ' ? " 55THE YEARLING THE YEARLING " Old Slewfoot . " A roar broke . " Where 's he feedin ' ? Which-a-way did he come from ? Where 's he gone ? " Pa Forrester thumped the floor with his cane . " You fellers shut up and leave Penny tell it . He cai n't tell a thing , and you-all bellerin ' like bulls . " Ma Forrester banged a pot-lid and lifted a pan of corn-bread as big , Jody thought , as a syrup kettle . The good smells from the hearth were overwhelming . She said , " Do n't git Mr. Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners ? " " And where 's your manners , " Pa Forrester reproached his sons , " not givin ' comp'ny the chancet to wet his whistle afore dinner ? " Mill-wheel ' went into a bedroom and returned with a demijohn . He pulled out the corn-cob stopper and handed the jug to Penny . " You 'll excuse me , " Penny said , " if I do n't drink deep . I ai n't got as big a place to put it as you fellers . " They laughed uproariously . Mill-wheel passed the jug about the room . " Jody ? " Penny said , " He ai n't old enough . " Pa Forrester said , " Why , I were weaned on it . " Ma Forrester said , " Pour me a noggin . In my cup . " She ladled food into pans big enough to wash in . The long trenchered table was covered with steam . There were dried cow-peas boiled with white bacon , a haunch of roast venison , a platter of fried squirrel , swamp cabbage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A raisin pudding waited at the side of the hearth . " If I 'd of knowed you was comin ' , " she said , " I 'd of cooked somethin ' fitten . Well , draw up . " 56Jody looked at his father to see whether he too was excited by the savory plenty . Penny 's face was somehow grave . " All this here is fine enough for the governor , " he said . Ma Forrester said uncomfortably , " I reckon you folks gives thanks , to your table . Pa , hit wo n't hurt you none to ask a blessin ' , long as we got comp'ny . " The old man looked about unhappily and folded his hands . " Oh Lord , once more Thou hast done see fit to bless our sinnin ' souls and bellies with good rations . Amen . " The Forresters cleared their throats and fell to . Jody sat oppositehis father , and between Ma Forrester and Fodder-wing . He found his plate piled high . Buck and Mill-wheel slipped choice morsels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jody . The Forresters ate with concentration , silent for once . The food melted away before them . An argument arose between Lem and Gabby . Their father pounded on the table with his withered fist . They protested a moment at the intervention , then subsided . Pa Forrester leaned close to Penny and murmured in a low voice . " My boys is rough , I know . They do n't do what they ought . They drink a heap and they fight and ary woman wants to git away from ' em has got to run like a doe . But I 'll say this for ' em  --  they ai n't nary one of ' em has ever cussed his mammy or his pappy at the table . " 57PA FORRESTER said , " Well , neighbor , let 's have the news about that tormented bear . " Ma Forrester said , " Yes , and you scapers git the dishes washed afore you git too deep into it , too .

" I got no girls , " she said . " If these fellers wants me to cook for ' em , they kin jest clean up after me . " Jody looked at his father , pleading mutely that this piece of heresy be not taken home to Baxter 's Island . The Forresters made short work of the dishes . Fodder-wing hobbled after them , gathering the scraps for all the animals . Only by feeding the58THE YEARLINGpack of dogs himself , could he be sure of saving tid-bits for his pets as well . He smiled to himself , that there would be so much today to take to them . There was even enough cold food left for supper . Jody gaped at the abundance . The Forresters finished their work in a clatter , and hung the iron pots and kettles on nails near the hearth . They drew up their cowhide chairs and hand-hewn benches around Penny . Some lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugs . Ma Forrester lipped a little snuff . Buck picked up Penny 's gun and a small file and began to work on the loose hammer . " Well , " Penny began , " he takened us plumb by surprise . " Jody shivered . " He slipped in like a shadow and killed our brood-sow . Laid her open , end to end , and only ate a mouthful . Not hongry . Jest low-down and mean . " Penny paused to light his own pipe . The Forresters bent to him with blazing splinters of fat pine . " He come as quiet as a black cloud , into the wind . Made a circle to git his wind right . So quiet , the dogs never heered nor scented him . Even this un  --  even this un  --  " he leaned to stroke the feist at his feet  --  " was fooled .

We tracked him the Juniper Bay . We tracked him the the swamp , the trail gittin ' hotter and hotter . We come up with him " The Forresters gripped their knees . " We come up with him , men , right smack at the edge o ' Juniper Creek , where the water flows swiftest and deepest . " The story , Jody thought , was even better than the hunt . He saw it all again , the shadows and the fern , the broken palmettosand the running branch water . He was bursting with the excitement of the story . He was bursting , too , with pride in his59THE YEARLING I THE YEARLINGfather . Penny Baxter , no bigger than a dirt-dauber , could outhuntthe best of them .

" " Do n't press me , " Penny said . " I done told you he 's wuth-less . " " I notice he come outen it in mighty good shape . Not a mark on him , is there ? " " No , there 's nary mark on him .

" " No use lyin ' to me . Name your trade . " " I 'll trade you old Rip , instead . " " Think you 're foxy . I got better dogs than Rip right now . " Lem went to the wall and took down from its nails a gun . Itwas a London Fine Twist . The double barrels shone . The stock6owas walnut , warm and glowing . The twin hammers were jaunty . The fittings were chased and intricate . Lem swung it to his shoulder , sighted it . He handed it to Penny . " Right from England . No more muzzle-loadin ' .

" A hairy paw closed over Penny 's hand . " Here , boy ! " Lem whistled to the feist . He took him by the scruff of the neck and led him outside , as though fearful even now of losing him . Penny teetered in his chair . He balanced the gun indifferently across his knees . Jody could not take his eyes from its perfection . He was filled with awe that his father had out-witted a Forrester . He wondered if Lem would keep his promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had never occurred to him that one man could get the best of another by the simple expedient of telling him the truth . Talk went on into the afternoon . Buck had tightened upPenny 's old muzzle-loader so that he thought it could bented on . The Forresters were unhurried ; unoccupied . Talesre told of old Slewfoot 's smartness ; of other bears beforem ; but none so clever as he . Chases were described in everydetail . Dogs twenty years dead were called by name and byperformance . Fodder-wing grew tired of them and wanted togo to the pond and fish for minnows . But Jody could not bearto leave this telling of old tales . Pa and Ma Forrester chirped6iTHE YEARLINGand shrilled occasionally , then dozed off in between , like sleepy crickets . At last their infirmities took them over , and they slept soundly , side by side in their rockers , their dried old frames stiff even in their slumber . Penny stretched and rose . He said , " I hate to leave good comp'ny . " " Spend the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but I do n't like to leave my place without no man on it . " Fodder-wing tugged at his arm .

" " He 'll want to tear me down . And after that , I 'm hopin ' he 'll laugh . Good-by , son , ' til tomorrer . Be good now . " The Forresters followed to see him off . Jody waved after his father with a new sense of aloneness . He was almost tempted62THE YEARLINGto call him back ; to run after him and climb up in the saddle and ride home with him to the snugness of the clearing . Fodder-wing called , " The ' coon 's fishin ' in a puddle , Jody ! Come see ! " He ran to watch the ' coon . It was paddling about in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something only instinct told it could be there . He played with Fodder-wing and the ' coon the rest of the afternoon . He helped to clean the squirrel 's box and build a cage for a crippled red-bird . The Forresters had game chickens , as wild as themselves . The hens laid their eggs all over the adjacent woods , in brierberry tangles , under piles of brush , and the snakes ate as many as the hens hatched . He went with Fodder-wing to collect the eggs . A hen was setting . Fodder-wing gave her the eggs they had gathered . There were fifteen in all . " This un 's a good mother , " he said . It appeared that he took charge of all such matters . Again Jody longed for something of his own . Fodder-wing would give him the fox squirrel , even , he believed , the baby ' coon . But past experience had taught him not to aggravate his mother with another mouth , no matter how small , to feed . Fodder-wingtalked to the setting hen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You hatch all them eggs into biddies . I want yellow biddies this time . None o ' them black uns . " They turned back toward the cabin . The ' coon came crying to meet them . It scrambled up Fodder-wing 's crooked legs and back and snugged down , clasping his neck . It closed its small white teeth over his skin and shook its head with pretended ferocity . Fodder-wing let Jody carry it to the cabin . It looked up at him with inquiring bright eyes , aware of his strangeness ; then accepted him . The Forresters had scattered over their land at chores which they took leisurely , in their stride . Buck and63THE YEARLING Arch drove the penned cows and their calves to the pond to water . Mill-wheel fed the string of horses in the corral . Pack and Lem had disappeared into the dense woods north of the cabin ; perhaps , Jody speculated , to their still . There was ease and abundance here , as well as violence . There were so many of them to do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as large as theirs , alone . Jody remembered guiltily the unhoed rows of corn he had left behind him . But Penny would not mind finishing them . Pa and Ma Forrester were still asleep in their chairs . The sun was red in the west . Darkness came quickly into the cabin , for the live oaks kept out light that would have been still bright at the Baxters ' clearing . One by one the brothers trooped into the cabin . Fodder-wing started up the fire on the hearth to heat the left-over coffee . Jody saw Ma Forrester open one careful eye , then close it again . Her sons piled the cold food on the table with a clatter that would have awakened an owl in the daytime . She sat up and prodded Pa Forrester in the ribs and joined the rest at their supper . This time they cleaned every platter . There was not even food left for the dogs . Fodder-wing mixed a pan of cold cornbread with a bucket of clabber and took it outside for them . He swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jody ran to help him . After supper , the Forresters smoked and talked of horses . The cattle-men in the county , and farther to the west , were complaining of a scarcity . Wolves and bears and panthers had raised havoc with the spring 's colts . The traders who came usually from Kentucky with strings of horses had not appeared . The Forresters agreed that it would be profitable to go north and west and trade for cattle ponies . Jody and Fodder-wing lost interest in the talk and went into a corner to play mumblede- peg . Ma Baxter would never have allowed pocket knives to be flipped into her clean smooth floors . Here , a few splinters more 64 THE YEARLINGor less could make no difference . Jody sat up erect from the game . " I know something I bet you do n't know . " " What ? " " The Spaniards used to cross the scrub right in front of our gate . " " Why , I knowed that . " Fodder-wing hunched close and began to whisper excitedly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " What you seed ? " " I 've seed the Spaniards . They 're tall and dark and have shiny helmets and they ride black horses . " " You could n't see ' em . There ai n't none left . They 've done left here , jest like the Injuns . " Fodder-wing closed one eye wisely . " That 's what folks tell you . You listen to me . Next time you go west o ' your sink-hole  --  you know that big magnolia ? With dogwood all around it ? You look behind that magnolia . There 's allus a Spaniard on a black horse ridin ' past that magnolia . " The hair stiffened on Jody 's neck . This was , of course , another of Fodder-wing 's tales . This was why his father and mother said Fodder-wing was crazy . But he longed to believe it . It would do no harm at least to look behind the magnolia . The Forresters stretched and knocked out their pipes or spat out their tobacco . They went into their bedrooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bed for each , for no two of them could sleep together in any double bed . Fodder-wing led Jody to his own bed in a shed-like room under the kitchen eaves . " You kin have the pillow , " he told him . Jody wondered if his mother would ask him if he had washed his feet . How freely the Forresters lived , he thought , tumbling into bed without it . Fodder-wing began a tall tale about the65THE YEARLINGend of the world . It was empty and dark , he said , with only clouds to ride on . At first Jody was interested . Then the tale became dull and rambling . He dropped off to sleep and dreamed of Spaniards , riding clouds instead of horses . He awakened with a start late in the night . Din filled the cabin . His first thought was that the Forresters were fighting again . But the shouts held a community of purpose , and Ma Forrester called encouragement . A door was banged open and several of the dogs were halloo-ed inside . A light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs and men poured in . The men were stark naked , and they looked thinner and less bulky , but they seemed as tall as the cabin . Ma Forrester held a lighted tallow candle . Her grasshopper frame was lost inside a long gray flannel nightgown . The dogs shot under the bed and out again . Jody and Fodder-wing scrambled to their feet . No one troubled to explain the commotion . The boys followedafter the hunt . It led through every room and ended with a mad exit of the dogs through the torn mosquito netting that covered one window . " They 'll git him outside , " Ma Forrester said , suddenly placid . " Pesky varmint . " " Ma 's got the best ear for varmints , " Fodder-wing said proudly . " I guess anybody 'd hear him did he come scratchin ' around their bed-post , " she said . Pa Forrester hobbled into the room on his cane . " The night 's near about done , " he said . " I 'd ruther have a snort o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa , you got the most sense for sich a of buzzard . " He went to a cupboard and brought out the demi-john . The old man uncorked it and tipped it back and drank . Lem said , " Do n't take no sense to crave liquor . Give it here . " He took a deep draught and passed the jug on . He wiped hismouth and rubbed his bare stomach . He went to the wall and66THE YEARLINGfelt along it for his fiddle . He twanged the strings carelessly , then sat down and began to scrape a tune . Arch said , " You ai n't got that right , " and brought his guitar and sat on the bench beside him . Ma Forrester set the candle on the table . She asked , " You naked jay-birds fixin ' to set up ' til day ? " Arch and Lem were deep in their chords and no one answered her . Buck took his mouth-organ from a shelf and began a tune of his own . Arch and Lem stopped to listen , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dog take it , that 's purty . " The demi-john went around again . Pack brought out his Jew's-harp and Mill-wheel his drum , Buck changed his plaintivesong for a lively dance tune , and the idle music swung into full volume . Jody and Fodder-wing dropped on the floor betweenLem and Arch . Ma Forrester said , " Now you need n't think I aim to go to bed and miss nothin ' . " She unbanked the fire on the hearth and threw on fat-wood and moved the coffee-pot close . " You hootin ' owls ' 11 eat breakfast soon this mornin ' or I 'll know why , " she said . She winked at Jody . " Kill two birds with one stone . Have a frolic and git breakfast done with . " He winked back at her . He felt bold and gay and tremulous . He could not understand how his mother could disapprove of such frolicsome people . The music was out of tune and thunderous . It sounded like all the wild-cats in the scrub rounded up together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ear and soul . The wild chords went through Jody as though he too were a fiddle and Lem Forrester drew long fingers across him . Lem said to him in a low voice , " Iffen I only had my sweethearthere , to sing and dance . " Jody asked brashly , " Who-all 's your sweetheart ? " 67THE YEARLING " My leetle of Twink Weatherby . " " Why , she 's Oliver Hutto 's gal . " Lem lifted his fiddle-bow . Jody thought for an instant he meant to strike him . Then he went on with his fiddling , but his eyes smoldered . " You say that agin in your life , boy , and you 'll not have a tongue left to say it with . Understand ? " " Yes , Lem . Could be I was wrong , " he added eagerly . " I 'm jest tellin ' you . " He felt depressed a while , and disloyal to Oliver . Then the music caught him up again as though a great gust of wind lifted him across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pa and Ma Forrester joined the singing with shrill , wavering voices . Daylight came , and the mockingbirdsin the live oaks sang so clear and loud the Forresters heard them , and laid down their pieces , and saw the dawn in the cabin . Breakfast covered the table with some scantiness , for a Forresterbreakfast , for Ma had been too much occupied to do much cooking . The men pulled on only their breeches , for the food was ready and smoking . After breakfast , they washed above their beards , and put on their boots and shirts , and went leisurely about their day 's business . Buck saddled his big roan stallion and swung Jody up behind him on the rump , for there was not room for a feather with him in the saddle . Fodder-wing followed limping to the edge of the clearing , with the raccoon on his shoulder , and waved his stick in farewelluntil they were out of sight . Jody rode home with Buck to Baxter 's Island and waved after him as he went on . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he swung open the gate under the chinaberry that he remembered he had forgotten to look behind the magnolia tree for a Spaniard riding. 68JoDY clicked the gate behind him . The unmistakable smell of roasting meat filled the air . He ran around the side of the cabin . Resentment was mixed with his eagerness . Resisting the open kitchen door , he hurried to his father . Penny stepped out of the smoke-house and hailed him . The truth , a tangled pain and pleasure , was before him . A large deer hide was stretched on the smoke-house wall . Jody wailed , " You been huntin ' and did n't wait on me . " He stamped his foot . " I ai n't never goin ' to leave you go off without me agin . " " Easy , son , ' til you hear . Be proud things come so bounti-ful . " His wrath cooled . Curiosity bubbled like a spring . " Tell me quick , Pa , how come . " 69THE YEARLINGPenny sat down on his heels in the sand . Jody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I near about run him down . " Again he was furious . " Why' n't it wait ' til I got home ? " " Did n't you pleasure yourself at the Forresters ? You cai n't git all your ' coons up one tree . " " Hit could of waited . They ai n't never enough time . Hit go too fast . " Penny laughed . " Well , son , you nor me nor no man , ai n't never yit learnt to halt it . " " Were the buck runnin ' ? " " Jody , I 'll declare . I ai n't never had meat stand and wait for me , the way that buck stood in the road . He did n't pay the horse no mind . Jest stood there . My first thought was , " Tarnation , and me with no shells to my new gun . ' Then I unbreechedthe gun and looked in , and bless Heaven , I mought o ' knowed a Forrester would have ary gun full-loaded . There was two shells in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitin ' . I cracked down and he dropped . Right in the road , handy as a sack o ' meal . I h'isted him over old Caesar 's rump and away we goed . Tell you what come to me . Me bringin ' in venison , ' I figgered , Ma wo n't crawl me for leavin ' Jody with Fodder-wing . " " What did she say when she seed the new gun and the meat ? " " She said , If ' t was anybody but a honest fool like you , I 'd swear you 'd been out thievin ' . " They chuckled together . The odors from the kitchen were savory . The hours with the Forresters were forgotten . There was no reality but the day 's dinner . Jody went into the kitchen . " Hey , Ma . I 'm home . " " Well , must I laugh or cry ? " THE YEARLINGHer ample figure was bent over the hearth . The day was warm and sweat ran down her heavy neck . " We got us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , and a good thing , too , with you off all the time . " " Ma " " What is it ? " " We eatin ' venison today ? " She turned from the fire . " Merciful Heaven , do n't you never think o ' nothin ' but your empty belly ? " " You cook venison so good , Ma . " She was mollified . " We eatin ' it today . I was feared it 'd not keep , and the weather warm . " " The liver 'll not keep , neither . " " Well , for pity 's sake , we cai n't eat ever'thing to oncet . If you 'll fill my wood-box this evenin ' , could be we 'd eat liver tonight . " He prowled among the dishes . " Git outen my kitchen , lessen you want to torment me to death . Then what 'd you do for dinner ? " " I 'd cook it . " " Yes , you and the dogs . " He ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Julia ? " It seemed to him he had been away a week . " Doin ' fine . Give her a month , and she 'll have of Slewfoot hollerin ' . " " Is the Forresters aimin ' to he'p us hunt him ? " " We never come to no agreement . I 'd ruther they hunted their way and leave me hunt mine . I do n't much care who gits him , long as we keep him often our stock . " " Pa , I never told you . I was scairt when the dogs was fightin ' him . I was too scairt even to run . " THE YEARLING " Hit did n't pleasure me none , neither , when I found I did n't have me a gun . " " But you told it to the Forresters like as if we was mighty bold-hearted . " " Well , son , that 's what makes a tale . " Jody examined the deer hide . It was large and handsome , red with spring . The game seemed for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the quarry . He wanted only to see it fall . When it lay dead and bleeding , he was sickened and sorry . His heart ached over the mangled death . Then when it was cut into portions , and dried and salted and smoked ; or boiled or baked or fried in the savory kitchen or roasted over the camp-fire , it was only meat , like bacon , and his mouth wa tered at its goodness . He wondered by what alchemy it was changed , so that what sickened him one hour , maddened him with hunger , the next . It seemed as though there were either two different animals or two different boys . The hides did not change . They kept their aliveness . When- ever he stepped with bare feet on the soft deer-skin beside his bed , he half expected to feel it start under him . Penny , small body though he was , had a scattering of black hair across his thin chest . As a boy , he had slept naked in winter in a bear- skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had grown hair on his chest from so sleeping . It was her joke , but Jody half believed it . The clearing was filled as abundantly as the Forresters ' . His mother had ground the slaughtered sow into sausage . Stuffed casings hung in the smoke-house . A slow hickory fire smoked under them . Penny left his work to drop a few chips of wood on the smoldering embers . Jody said , " Must I chop wood or finish hoein ' the corn ? " " Now , Jody , you know good and well I could n't let theweeds take the corn . I finished the hoein ' . Wood 's the thing . " He was glad to go to the wood-pile , for if he did not doTHE YEARLINGsomething to occupy his mind , hunger would force him to gnaw the dogs ' alligator meat or pick up the chickens ' scraps of cornbread . The time went slowly at first , and he was tormentedwith the desire to follow his father 's activities . Then Penny disappeared in the mule lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armful of wood to his mother as an excuse to see how dinner was progressing . He was relieved to see it on the table . She was pouring the coffee . " Call your Pa , " she said . " And wash them turrible hands . I 'll guarantee you ai n't touched water since you left home . " Penny came at last . The ham of venison filled the center of the table . He drew his carving knife with maddening deliberationacross the meat . Jody said , " I 'm so hongry , my belly thinks my throat is cut . " Penny laid down the knife and looked at him . Ma Baxter said , " Now if that ai n't a purty somethin ' to say . Where 'd you learn to say that ? " " Well , that 's what the Forresters say . " " I knowed it . That 's the kind o ' thing you learn o ' them low-down rascals . " " They ai n't low-down , Ma . " " Ever ' one of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They ai n't black-hearted . They 're purely friendly . Ma , they fiddle and play and sing better'n the fiddlers ' convention . We was up long before day , singin ' and frolickin ' . It was fine . " " That 's all right if they got nothin ' better to do . " Meat was before them , piled high on the plates . The Baxters fell to . A SOFT rain fell in the night . The April morning that followedwas clear and luminous . The young corn lifted pointed leaves and was inches higher . The cow-peas in the field beyond were breaking the ground . The sugar-cane was needle-points of greenness against the tawny earth . It was strange , Jody thought , whenever he had been away from the clearing , and came home again , he noticed things that he had never noticed before , but that had been there all the time . Young mulberries were clustered along the boughs , and before he went to the Forresters ' he had not even seen them . The Scuppernong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , was in bloom for the first time , fine and lace-like . The wild golden bees had found its fragrance , and were standing on their heads to guzzle its thin honey. 74THE YEARLINGFor two days he had filled his stomach so richly that this morning he felt a little languid and was not truly hungry . His father was up and out ahead of him , as usual . Breakfast was ready in the kitchen and his mother was tending the sausages in the smoke-house . The woodbox was low and Jody idled outsideto fill it . He was in a mood for work , but it must be somethinggentle and unhurried . He made two leisurely trips to fill the woodbox . Old Julia was dragging herself around in search of Penny . Jody stooped to stroke her head . She seemed to share the sense of well-being that filled the clearing ; or perhaps she understood that she had been spared a time longer to run through swamp and scrub and hammock . She wagged her long tail and stood quiet under his petting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were healing . Jody saw his father , moving across the road toward the house from the barns and lot . He dangled a strange object . He called to Jody . " I got a mighty cur'ous somethin ' . " Jody ran to him . The limp object was an animal , at once strange and familiar . It was a raccoon , but instead of being the usual iron-gray , it was all a creamy white . He could not believe his eyes . " How come it white , Pa ? Is it a of grand-daddy ' coon ? " " That 's what 's so cur'ous . A ' coon do n't never git to where he 's white-headed . No sir , hit 's one o ' them rare things the books calls a albino . Borned white . And look , them rings on its tail , them that 's due to be dark , they ai n't no more'n cream-colored . " They crouched in the sand and examined the ' coon . " Were it in the trap , Pa ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . I 'll declare , I hated a-killin ' of it . " Jody felt a sense of loss , that he had not known the albino ' coon alive . " Leave me tote him , Pa. " 75THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGHe cradled the dead animal in his arms . The pale fur seemed softer than the ordinary . The belly fur was as soft as the fluff of new-hatched biddies . He stroked it . " I 'd of loved to of ketched him leetle , Pa , and raised him . " " He 'd of been a purty pet , a'right , but likely jest as mean as ary other ' coon . " They turned in at the gate and around ( he side of the house to the kitchen . " Fodder-wing said none of his ' coons was n't never pertickler mean . " " Yes , but a Forrester would n't scarcely notice if he was to git bit . " " Likely he 'd bite right back , eh , Pa ? " They laughed together , picturing their neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing the animal . " You got him . Good . That 's what 's been goin ' with my hens . " " But Ma , " Jody protested . " Look at him . He 's white . He 's a cur'ossity . " " He 's a thievin ' varmint right on , " she said indifferently . " Is the hide wuth more'n usual ? " Jody looked at his father . Penny was deep in the wash-basin . He opened one bright eye among the soap-suds and winked at his son . " Likely ai n't wuth a nickel , " he said carelessly . " Jody 's been a-wantin ' of a leetle knapsack . Jest as good to leave him use up the hide . " Next to having the albino ' coon alive , nothing could be finer than a knapsack of the soft curious fur . Jody 's mind was full of it . He could not eat his breakfast . He wanted to show his gratitude . " I kin clean the water troughs , Pa , " he said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come spring , to hire us a deep well dug . Then them water troughs could fill with trash and welcome . But bricks is mighty high . " " I 'd not know what ' t was , not to be sparin ' o ' my water , " Ma Baxter said . " For twenty years , I been sparin ' . " " Now be patient , Ma , " Penny said . His face furrowed . Jody knew that the lack of abundant water was a trial to his father , and a greater hardship than for mother or son . Jody was held accountable for wood , but it was Penny himself who slung the ox yoke across his narrow shoulders , hung the great hewn cypress buckets at either end , and trudged up and down the sandy road from the clearing to the sink-hole , where seepage alone built pools of water , ambercoloredfrom leaf-mould , and filtered by the sand . It was as though the labor were Penny 's apology to his family for havingestablished them on land so arid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away . For the first time , Jody wondered why his father had chosen to inhabit this place . Thinking of the pools on the steep side of the sink-hole that must be cleared , he was almost tempted to wish that they lived on the river , with Grandma Hutto . Yet the clearing , the island of tall pines , made up the world . Life in other places was only a tale that was told , as Oliver Hutto told of Africa and China and Connecticut . His mother said , " You better put a biscuit-two and some meat in your pocket . You ai n't et . " He filled his pockets . " You know what I wisht I had , Ma ? A pouch like a ' possum , to tote things . " " The Lord put your stomach inside you o ' purpose . He meant you to put your rations inside you when your Ma sets ' em on the table . " 77THE YEARLINGHe rose and ambled to the door . Penny said , " You git on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've skinned out your ' coon hide . " The day was bright and windy . Jody took a grubbing hoe from the shed behind the house and strolled toward the road . The mulberry trees by the fence were a sharp green . His mother 's favorite hen clucked to her biddies from the slat coop . He scooped up a small ball of yellow down and held it against his cheek , its cheepings shrill in his ear . He released it and it scurried for shelter under the fat hen 's wings . The yard would soon need hoeing . The walk from the front steps to the gate needed hoeing , too . The walk was bordered with cypress slats , but the weeds crept under and over , and grew impudently among the Amaryllis that lined the pathway . The lavender petals of the chinaberry blooms were falling . Jody scuffed his bare toes through them and went through the gate . He hesitated . The barns were tempting . There might be a new hatching of biddies . The calf might have a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good reason to give himself for prowling about , the increasingly unwelcome job of cleaning the water troughs might be that much longer postponed . Then it occurred to him that if he finished the cleaning in short order , he might be through for the day . He swung the grubbing hoe over his shoulder and set off at a trot toward the sink-hole . The end of the world , he thought , might be like the sinkhole . Fodder-wing had said that it was empty and dark , with only clouds to ride on . But no one knew . Certainly reaching it must feel as it felt to reach the edge of the sink-hole . Jody wished that he had been the first to discover it . He turned the corner of the fence row . He left the road and took the trail . It was narrow , hemmed in by briers . He pretended that he did not know there was a sink-hole . He passed a dogwood tree . THE YEARLINGIt was a landmark . He closed his eyes and whistled carelessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of his determination , in spite of squeezing his eyelids tight , he could not make himself go farther with his eyes shut . He opened them and walked with a sense of relief the last few steps to the edge of the great limestone sink . A small world lay at his feet . It was deep and concave , like a great bowl . Fodder-wing said that a bear as big as God had scooped out a pawful of earth to get a lily-root . Jody knew the truth from his father . It was only that underground rivers ran through the earth and swirled and eddied beneath the surface , and changed their courses . This was especially so where there were streaks of limestone , as here . The limestone was soft and crumbling before the air touched and hardened it . Sometimes , without reason , without warning , after long rains , perhaps , a section of earth sank in , gently and almost without sound , and a deep cavity marked the place where once had run , darkly and unseen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in depth and width . Baxter 's sink-hole was sixty feet deep . It was so wide that Penny 's old muzzle-loader could not hit a squirrel from one side to the other . The sink-hole was as round as though it had been dug so on purpose . Staring into it , it seemed to Jody that the truth of its fashioning was more fantastic than the tales of Fodder-wing . The hole was older than Penny Baxter . Penny said he could remember when the trees that lined its steep banks were no larger much than saplings . Now they were of great size . A magnoliathat grew half-way up the east bank had a trunk as broad as the mill-stone with which the Baxters ground their meal . A hickory was as thick as a man 's thigh . A live oak spread its branches across half the sink-hole . Smaller trees , sweet gum and dogwood , ironwood and holly , grew lushly up and down the banks . Palmettos thrust tall spears among them . Giant ferns grew from top to bottom . Jody looked downinto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool and moist and , always , mysterious . The sink-hole was set in the arid scrub , at the core of the pine island , like a lush green heart . The trail to the bottom of the sink-hole led down the west bank . It was worn deep into the sand and limestone by the years of Penny Baxter 's feet , leading his stock to water . In the dryest weather , there was a continual seepage which dripped down the banks and came to gather at the bottom in a shallowpool . This water was stagnant , and clouded by the comingsand goings of the animals who watered there . Only Penny 's hogs used it for drinking and wallowing . For the other stock , and for his own family 's use , Penny had an ingeniousarrangement . Up the east , or opposite , bank from the trail , he had cut out of the limestone strata a series of troughs to catch and hold the filtered seepage . The lowest trough was shoulder-high from the bottom of the sink-hole . Here he led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here in his young manhood he had led the yoke of cream-colored oxen with which he had cleared his land . A few yards higher up , he had cut a pair of deeper troughs . Here his wife brought her block and paddle and came to do her washing . A portion of the bank bore a milky whitewash from the years of her soap-suds . For her annual quilt-washing , she caught rain water . At the last , high above the stock trough and the wash troughs , lay a deep , narrow trough that gathered water used only for cooking and drinking . The bank above was so steep that none of the larger animals disturbed the water . The deer that came , the bears , the panthers , all used the west trail and watered either at the pool itself , or at the stock trough . Squirrelsdrank from the upper trough , and occasionally a wild-cat , but for the most it was untouched by anything but Penny 's gourd , dipping into it to fill his cypress buckets . Jody jolted down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made a clumsy stock , catching in the wild grape vines . The descent always excited him . Step by step the banks lifted above him . Step by step he passed the tops of trees . A breath of wind eddied into the green bowl , stirring waves of coolness . The leaves fluttered their thin hands . The ferns bent a moment to the ground . A red-bird swung in an arc across the sink-hole . It turned and dropped down to the pool , like a bright leaf falling . Seeing the boy , it whirred up and away . Jody knelt by the pool . The water was clear , for the hogs were feeding to the north in the marshy prairies , and had no need of the sink-hole . A small green frog eyed the boy from a partly submerged twig . The nearest water was a couple of miles away . It seemed amazingthat frogs should travel so far , to settle in a small and distant pool . He wondered if the first frog migrants had known that there was water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink-hole and hesitated on their green haunches . Penny said that once in rainy weather he had seen a line of frogs in single file , like marching soldiers , crossing the dry flat-woods . Did they move blindly or with knowledge ? Penny did not know . Jody flipped a frond of fern into the pool and the frog dove and hid himself in the soft muck . A sense of aloneness that was not lonely came to the boy . He decided that when he was grown he would build himself a little house beside the pool . The animals would become used to it , and he would look out of the windows on moonlit nights and see them drinking . He crossed the flat floor of the sink-hole and climbed a few feet to reach the stock trough . It was awkward , bringing the grubbing hoe over his shoulder and into the trough . He discardedit and went at his work with his two hands . An accumulation of leaves and sand had left a thick layer . He dug and scraped vigorously . He worked against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and empty for an instant 8o 8iTHE YEARLINGThe seepage had returned by the time he took his hands away . The limestone trough was white and clean . He left it with satisfaction and moved higher up the bank to the more laboriouswork of scouring out the larger wash troughs . Constant use kept these comparatively free from leaves , but the soapsudsin time made them slippery . He climbed a sweet gum and gathered an armful of Spanish moss . It made good scouring material . He scooped sand from a bare spot on the bank and used it with the moss . He was tired when he reached the drinking trough at the top . The incline was so steep that by resting his belly flat against the bank , he needed only to lower his head , like a fawn , to drink . He ran his tongue up and down the length of the trough . He darted it in and out and leaned back to watch the ripples . He wondered whether a bear lapped water like a dog or sucked it in like a deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deciding . Lapping was slower , but he choked when he sucked the water in . He could not decide . Penny would know how a bear drank . He had probably actually seen them . Jody buried his face completely in the water . He turned it from side to side , so that first one cheek and then the other was laved and cooled . He stood on his head in the trough , resting his weight on the palms of his hands . He tried to see how long he could hold his breath . He made bubbles . He heard his father 's voice at the bottom of the sink-hole . " Son , how come that water to feel so good to you ? Put the same thing in the wash-basin , you act like ' t was somethingnasty . " He turned , dripping . " Pa , I never heered you comin ' . " " You had your dirty leetle of face too deep in what your pore Pa was fixin ' to take a drink of . " " I wa' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 82THE YEARLING " I ai n't that thirsty . " Penny climbed the bank and examined the lower troughs . He nodded . He leaned over the rim of the wash trough and chewed a twig . " I declare , " he said , " your Ma purely shocked me when she said twenty years ' . I jest had n't never set down and reckoned the time . The years has slipped by me , one by one , me not noticin ' nor countin ' . Ever ' spring , I 'd figger to git your Ma a well dug . Then I 'd need a ox , or the cow 'd bog down and perish , or one o ' the young uns 'd put in and die and I 'd have no heart for well-diggin ' , and medicine to pay for . Bricks so turrible high  --  When I begun diggin ' oncet , and got no water at thirty feet , I knowed I was in for it . But twenty years is too long to ask ary woman to do her washin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " We 'll git her a well one day . " " Twenty years  --  " Penny repeated . " But always somethin ' interferin ' . And the war  --  And then the land to be cleared all over agin . " He stood leaning against the trough , looking backward along the years . " When I first come here , " he said , " when I picked this place and come to it , I hoped " The morning 's question came to Jody 's mind again . " How come you to pick it , Pa ? " " Well , I picked it because  --  " His face puckered , his mind seeking words . " I jest craved peace , was all . " He smiled . " Out here I got it , excusin ' the bears and panthers and wolves and wild-cats  --  and now and agin , your Ma . " They sat in silence . The squirrels began to stir in the treetops . Suddenly Penny poked Jody in the ribs with his elbow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pointed to a sweet gum . A half-grown raccoon was peer-83THE YEARLING ing around the side of the trunk , a dozen feet from the ground . It saw itself observed and pulled back out of sight . In an instant the masked face looked again . Penny said , " I reckon we be as cur'ous to the creeturs as they be to us . " " How come some is skeert and some is bold ? " " That I do n't know . It depend , likely , on how young a creetur is scairt . They do n't seem to be no rule for it . I mind me , oncet , I 'd been huntin ' all mornin '  --  this were over on Wild-cat Prairie  --  and I set down under a live oak and made me a leetle fire to warm me and cook me a bit o ' bacon . Well , whilst I was settin ' there , a fox walked right up t' other side o ' the fire and laid down . I looked at him and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I takened a piece o ' meat and I jobbed it on a long stick and I helt it out to him . I helt it right over his nose . Now a fox is mighty wild and I ai n't never knowed one to git that hongry to where he would n't run . And you know that fox laid there right on , lookin ' at me , and never et nor run . " " I 'd love to of seed him . What you figger made him lay there , Pa , lookin ' at you ? " " Hit 's been a puzzlement to me all these years since it hap- pened . All I kin figger is , the dogs had run him until he got heated and his brains was cooked . I figger , for some reason , that fox were cold-out crazy . " The ' coon had moved into full view . Jody said , " Pa , I wisht I had me somethin ' to pet and play with , like Fodder-wing . I wisht I had me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that . " Penny said , " You know how your Ma rares . I 'd not mind it , for I love the creeturs . But times has been hard and rations scarce , and your Ma 's the one to say . " " I 'd love a baby fox , or a baby panther . Kin you tame ' em , do you git ' em young ? " 84 THE YEARLING " You kin tame a ' coon . You kin tame a bear . You kin tame a wild-cat and you kin tame a panther . " He pondered . His mind went back to his father 's sermons . " You kin tame arything , son , excusin ' the human tongue . " JODY lay comfortably ill , recovering from the fever . His mother called it the fever , so he did not argue . He thought privately that too many half-ripe brierberries might have something to do with his ailment . Treatment for such things was always much more violent than treatment for the fever . His mother had observed his shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Git into the bed . You got chills and fever . " He had said nothing . She came into the room now with a cup of steaming liquid . He eyed it anxiously . For two days she had been giving him lemon-leaf tea . It was aromatic and pleasant . When he had grumbled about its tartness , she had added a teaspoon of jelly to it . He wondered if now , in the mysterious wisdom that sometimes descended on her , she had discovered the truth . THE YEARLINGIf she guessed that his trouble had been the colic , the medicineshe held would be either snake-root tonic , or a blood purifier made from Queen 's Delight , both of which he abominated . " If your Pa 'd only plant me a root o ' fever grass , " she said , " I could git both o ' you well o ' the fever in no time . ' Tai n't decent , not havin ' fever-grass in the yard . " " What you got in the cup , Ma ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . " " I got a right to know . Supposin ' you kilt me and I never knowed what medicine you give me .

Open your mouth . If ' tai n't the measles , this here wo n't hurt you . If ' t is the measles , hit 'll bring out the rash . " The thought of bringing out a rash was tempting . He opened his mouth . She grasped him by the hair and poured half the cupful down his throat . He sputtered and fought . " I wo n't take no more . ' Tai n't the measles . " " Well , you 'll die if ' t is , and the rash do n't break out . " He opened his mouth again and took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not nearly as bad as some of her concoctions . The bitter brew she made from pomegranate peelings , or that from pitcher-plant root , was infinitely worse . He lay back on his moss-stuffed pillow . " If ' t is the measles , Ma , how soon will the rash come ? " " Soon as you git to sweatin ' from the tea . Kiver up . " She left the room and he resigned himself to waiting for the sweat . Being sick was something of a treat . He would not willingly go through the first night again , when cramps had tied him in knots . But the convalescence , the solicitude of his mother and his father , was definitely pleasant . He felt a faint86 87THE YEARLING J THE YEARLINGsense of guilt that he had not told about the brierberries . She would have given him a purge , and it would all have been over with by the next morning . Penny had done all the work of the clearing alone for two days . He had hitched old Cxsar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , had worked the corn and the cow-peas and the small patch of tobacco . He had hauled water from the sink-hole , cut wood , fed and watered the stock . But perhaps , Jody speculated , he did have the fever . Perhapshe was coming down with the measles . He felt his face and stomach . There was no rash yet , no sweat . He flounced back and forth in the bed to hurry the heating . He realized that he felt as well as ever ; better , actually , than before the plenitude of meat had tempted him into over-eating . He recalledthe quantities of fresh sausage and of venison that he had eaten without his mother 's stopping him . Perhaps after all the brierberries had had nothing to do with it . He was sweating at last . He called , " Hey , Ma , come see ! The sweat 's done come . " She came to him and examined him . " You feel as good as I do , " she said . " Git outen that bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the deerskinrug . For a moment he was light-headed . " You feel all right ? " she asked . " Yessum . Sort o ' weakified . " " Well , you ai n't et nothin ' . Git into your shirt and breeches and come git you some dinner . " He dressed quickly and followed her to the kitchen . The food was still warm . She laid out biscuits for him , and a plate of hash , and poured him a cup of sweet milk . She watched him eat . " I hoped you 'd git up a leetle mite pacified , " she said . " Kin I have some more hash , Ma ? " " I should say not . You 've et enough now , to fill a alligator . " " Where 's Pa ? " " To the lot , I reckon . " He strolled in search of him . Penny was sitting idly , for once , on the gate . " Well , son , " he said , " you look right peert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got the measles , or the child-bed fever , or the smallpox ? " The blue eyes twinkled . Jody shook his head . " Pa " Yes , son . " " I do n't figger there was nothin ' ailded me but green brier-berries . " ' That 's about what I figgered . I never said nothin ' to your Ma , for she 's death on a belly-full of green brierberries . " Jody sighed with relief . Penny said , " I been settin ' here studyin ' . The moon 'll be right in a hour-two . What say you and me git us a couple o ' bobs and go fishin ' ? " " In the creek ? " " I sort o ' crave to fish some o ' them saw-grass ponds over where of Slewfoot was feedin ' . " " I 'll bet we kin ketch us a cattywampus in one o ' them ponds . " " We kin sure pleasure ourselves tryin ' . " They went together to the shed back of the house to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two new ones . He cut short hairs from the tail of the deer he had shot and made lures of the gray and white wisps . He tied them invisibly to the fish-hooks . " If I was a fish , I 'd strike at this myself , " he said . He went to the house and spoke briefly with his wife . " Me and Jody is goin ' bobbin ' for bass . " " I thought you was give out and Jody was ailin ' . " THE YEARLING " That 's why we 're goin ' fishin ' , " he said . She followed to the door and watched after them . " If you do n't git no bass , " she called , " ketch me a leetle bream I kin fry crisp and eat bones and all . " " We 'll not come back without somethin ' , " he promised . The afternoon was warm but the way seemed short . In a way , Jody thought , fishing was better than hunting . It was not so exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a reasonable cadence . There was time to look about , and see the increase of green leaves in the live oaks and magnolias . They stopped at a familiar pond . It was shallow from too long dryness . Penny found a grasshopper and threw it into the water . There was no strike ; no hungry swirl of waters . " I 'm feered the fish has died outen here , " he said . " These leetle of ponds in the middle o ' no-where has always been a puzzlement to me . I cai n't see how the fish lives here , year on year . " He caught another grasshopper and hurled it without result . " The pore fish , " he said . " Helpless in a world o ' their own . ' Stead o ' fishin ' for ' em , I 'd ought to come out here and feed ' em . " He lifted his bamboo rod over his shoulder . " Mebbe the Lord figgers the same about me , " he chuckled . " Mebbe he looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make out on that clearin ' . ' " He added , " But hit 's a good clearin ' . Likely the fish is as content as me . " Jody said , " Look , Pa , there 's people . " Human beings were a stranger sight in the lonely place of live oak islands and saw-grass ponds and prairies , than the creatures . Penny shaded his eyes . A file of half a dozen men and women was entering the scrub road they had just left behind . " Hit 's the Minorcans , " he said . " Huntin ' gophers. " 90THE YEARLINGJody saw now the sacks over their shoulders . The small dusty land-turtles whose deep burrows were an indication of the poorest soil , were the last food most inhabitants of the scrub considered edible . " I 've allus wondered , " Penny said , " did n't they make a medicine mebbe outen the gophers . Do n't seem like they 'd come here clear from the coast to hunt them things jest to cat . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jody said . " I 'd not pry on the pore things , " Penny said . " The Minorcansis a people was mighty bad put upon . My father knowed their hull history . A English feller carried ' em to New Smyrna , over by the ocean and the Indian River . He promised ' em a pure Heaven and put ' em to work . And when times got bad and the crops failed , he left ' em to nigh about starve to death . There was n't many left . " " Is they like gypsies ? " " No , for gypsies is wild . The men is dark , like gypsies , but the women is fair when they 're young . They mind their own business and live peaceable . " The procession disappeared into the scrub . Jody tingled , and the hair stirred on the back of his neck . It was like seeing Spaniards . It was as though phantoms , dark and shadowy , and not men and women , had passed before him , weighted with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now the bass had ought to be thick as tadpoles in that pond right over there . " They were in territory a little west of the prairie 's rim where old Slewfoot had fed on fire-plant . Dry weather had sucked up much of the water and the marsh had broad areas that were now firm and dry . The ponds showed plainly . They had withdrawn from the saw-grass and only lily pads troubled the water 's surface . A Blue Peter ran across them , bright with yellow legs and painted face . A slight breath of air rippled91THE YEARLINGacross the marsh and the water rippled under it . The lily pads tipped , an instant , their broad shining leaves to the glint of the sun . " Jest enough of a riffle , " Penny said , " and the moon jest right . " He fastened lengths of line to the two poles and attached the deer-hair bobs . " Now you work your bob acrost the north end and I 'll try the south . Do n't make no fuss , walkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an expert cast across the pond . He marveled at the skill of the knotted hands . The bob lay at the edge of a cluster of lily pads . Penny began to jerk it slowly across the water . It dipped and bobbed with the irregular rhythm of a live insect . There was no strike and Penny drew in his line and cast again in the same place . He called to invisible fish , lurking near the weedy bottom . " Now Grandpappy , I kin see you settin ' there on your stoop . " He jerked the bob more slowly . " You better lay down your pipe and come git your dinner . " Jody tore himself from the fascination of his father 's performanceand moved to his end of the pond . He cast badly for a time , tangling his line and laying his bob in the most unlikelyplaces ; over-reaching the narrow pond and enmeshing the hook in the tough saw-grass . Then something of harmony came to him . He felt his arm swing in a satisfying arc . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bob exactly where he had meant to , at the edge of a patch of switch-grass . Penny called , " Mighty nice , son . Leave it lay jest a minute . Then git ready the first second you jerk it . " He had not known his father was watching . He was tense . He jerked his pole cautiously and the bob flipped across the water . There was a swirl , a silver form shot half clear of the water , an open mouth as big as a cook-pot enveloped the bob . THE YEAKLIN ( iA weight like a millstone dropped at the end of his line , fought like a wild-cat , and pulled him off-balance . He braced himself against the frenzy to which he was irrevocably attached . Penny called , " Take it easy . Do n't let him git under them bonnets . Keep the tip o ' your pole up . Do n't give him no slack . " Penny left him to the struggle . His arms ached from the strain . He was afraid to tug too hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield an inch for fear a sudden slackness would tell of the loss of the giant . He longed for magic words from his father , indicating some miracle by which he might land his fish and be done with the torment . The bass was sulking . It made a dash for the grasses , where it might tangle the line around their stems and so rip free . It came to Jody that if he walked around the edge of the pond , keeping a taut line , he might lead the bass into shallow water and flounder him at the edge . He worked cautiously . He was tempted to drop the pole and clutch the line itself and come to grips with his adversary . He began to walk away from the pond . He gave his pole a heave and landed the bass , flouncing , in the grass . He dropped the pole and ran , to move the catch to a final safety , The bass would weigh ten pounds . Penny came to him . " Boy , I 'm proud of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jody stood panting . Penny thumped him on the back , as excited as he . He looked down , unbelieving , at the stout form and the great maw . " I feel as good as if ' t was ol ' Slewfoot , " he said , and the ) grinned together and pummeled each other 's backs . " Now I got to go beat you , " Penny said . They took separate ponds . Penny called that he was lickec and beaten . He began fishing for Ma Baxter 's bream with hand-line and bonnet worms . Jody cast and cast again , bu92 93THE YEARLINGthere was never the mad swirl of waters , the great leap , the live and struggling weight . He caught a small bass and held it up to show his father . " Throw him back , " Penny called . " We do n't need him for eatin ' . Leave him to grow up big as t' other one . Then we 'll come back agin and ketch him . " Jody put the small fish back reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about not taking more of anything , fish or game , than could be eaten or kept . Hope of another monster dwindled as the sun finished its spring arc of the daylight sky . He cast leisurely , taking his pleasure in his increasing dexterity of arm and wrist . The moon was now wrong . It was no longer feed-time . The fish were not striking . Suddenly he heard his father whistle like a quail . It was the signal they used together in squirrel hunting . Jody laid down his pole and looked back to make sure he could identify the tuft of grass where he had covered his bass from the rays of the sun . He walked cautiously to where his father beckoned . Penny whispered , " Foller me . We 'll ease up clost as we dare . " He pointed . " The whoopin ' cranes is dancin ' . " Jody saw the great white birds in the distance . His father 's eye , he thought , was like an eagle 's . They crouched on all fours and crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach and Jody dropped behind him . They reached a clump of high saw-grass and Penny motioned for concealment behind it . The birds were so close that it seemed to Jody he might touch them with his long fishing pole . Penny squatted on his haunches and Jody followed . His eyes were wide . He made a count of the whooping cranes . There were sixteen . The cranes were dancing a cotillion as surely as it was danced at Volusia . Two stood apart , erect and white , making a strange music that was part cry and part singing . The rhythm was THE YEARLINGirregular , like the dance . The other birds were in a circle . In the heart of the circle , several moved counter-clock-wise . The musicians made their music . The dancers raised their wings and lifted their feet , first one and then the other . They sunk their heads deep in their snowy breasts , lifted them and sunk again . They moved soundlessly , part awkwardness , part grace . The dance was solemn . Wings fluttered , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and around . The group in the center attained a slow frenzy . Suddenly all motion ceased . Jody thought the dance was over , or that the intruders had been discovered . Then the two musicians joined the circle . Two others took their places . There was a pause . The dance was resumed . The birds were reflected in the clear marsh water . Sixteen white shadows reflectedthe motions . The evening breeze moved across the sawgrass . It bowed and fluttered . The water rippled . The setting sun lay rosy on the white bodies . Magic birds were dancing in a mystic marsh . The grass swayed with them , and the shallow waters , and the earth fluttered under them . The earth was dancing with the cranes , and the low sun , and the wind and sky . Jody found his own arms lifting and falling with his breath , as the cranes ' wings lifted . The sun was sinking into the sawgrass . The marsh was golden . The whooping cranes were washed with gold . The far hammocks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water blackened . The cranes were whiter than any clouds , or any white bloom of oleander or of lily . Without warning , they took flight . Whether the hour-long dance was , simply , done , or whether the long nose of an alligator had lifted above the water to alarm them , Jody could not tell , but they were gone . They made a great circle against the sunset , whooping their strange rusty cry that sounded only in their flight . Then they flew in a long line into the west , and vanished . THE YEARLINGPenny and Jody straightened and stood up . They were cramped from the long crouching . Dusk lay over the sawgrass , so that the ponds were scarcely visible . The world was shadow , melting into shadow . They turned to the north . Jody found his bass . They cut to the east , to leave the marsh behind them , then north again . The trail was dim in the growing darkness . It joined the scrub road and they turned once more east , continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrub bordered the road like walls . The scrub was black and the road was a dark gray strip of carpet , sandy and soundless . Small creatures darted across in front of them and scurried in the bushes . In the distance , a panther screamed . Bull-bats shot low over their heads . They walked in silence . At the house , bread was baked and waiting , and hot fat was in the iron skillet . Penny lighted a fat-wood torch and went to the lot to do his chores . Jody scaled and dressed the fish at the back stoop , where a ray of light glimmered from the fire on the hearth . Ma Baxter dipped the pieces in meal and fried them crisp and golden . The family ate without speaking . She said , " What ails you fellers ? " They did not answer . They had no thought for what they ate nor for the woman . They were no more than conscious that she spoke to them . They had seen a thing that was unearthly . They were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fawns were being born . Jody saw through the scrub the delicate tracery of their small pointed hooves . Wherever he went , to the sink-hole , for wood into the black-jacks south of the lot , to the traps , Penny was obliged to keep about for varmints , he walked with eyes on the ground , watching for signs of their comings and their goings . The larger hoof-marks of the does usually preceded them . But the does were wary . Often the doe-sign was in one place , where the mother had fed alone , and the wavering fawn-sign was some distance away , where the infanthad been left in the greater safety of heavy cover . Often there were twin fawns . When Jody found the double set of tracks he could scarcely contain himself . He thought always then , " I could leave one for the mammy and take one for myself . " 97THE YEARLINGHe broached the matter to his mother one evening . " Ma , we got milk a-plenty . Cai n't I git me a leetle ol ' fawn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cai n't I ? " " I should jest say not . What you mean , milk a-plenty ? They ai n't a extry drop left from sun to sun . " " It could have my milk . " " Yes , and fatten the blasted fawn and you grow up puny . Much as we all got to do , what on earth do you want with one o ' them things , blayting around here day and night ? " " I want one . I want a ' coon , but I know a ' coon gits mischievous . I 'd love a bear cub , but I know they 're liable to be mean . I jest want something  --  " he puckered his face so that his freckles ran together  --  " I jest want something all my own . Somethingto foller me and be mine . " He struggled for words . " I want something with dependence to it . " His mother snorted . " Well , you 'll not find that no-where . Not in the animal world nor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not have you pesterin ' me . You say another word , fawn ' or " coon ' or bear cub , ' and I 'll take a bresh to you . " Penny listened quietly from his corner . In the morning he said , " We 'll go hunt us a buck today , Jody . Likely we 'll find a fawn beddin ' . Hit 's near about as much pleasure seein " em wild , as Navin " em tame . " " Will we take both dogs ? " " Nobody but old Julia . She ai n't had a work-out since she was hurt . A slow hunt 'll do her good . " Ma Baxter said , " That last venison did n't last no time . But we did jerk right smart of it , come to think of it . Git a few hams in the smoke-house and hit 'll look natural agin . " Her good nature rose and fell with the food supply . Penny said , " Jody , looks like you 've fell heir to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do it fail you like it failed me. " 98THE YEARLINGHe could not imagine being impatient about it . It was enough to have the use of it for himself . His mother had sewed the cream-colored ' coonskin into a knapsack for him . He filled it with shot and caps and wadding and filled the powder horn . Penny said , " Ma , I been studyin ' . I jest about got to go to Volusia to git me shell cases . Lem only th'owed in a few shells with the gun . And I 'd love some rale coffee . I 've had a bait o ' them wild coffee beans . " " Me , too , " she agreed . " And I need me some thread and a paper o ' needles . " " Now the bucks , " he said , " seems to be feedin ' toward the river . I been seein ' a perfect shower o ' tracks headin ' that-a-way .

" You 'll git to visitin ' with that sassy old woman and like as not you 'll be gone a couple o ' days . I think you 'd ought to leave Jody with me . " Jody squirmed and looked at his father . Penny said , " We 'll be back tomorrer . How 's Jody to learn to hunt and be a man if his daddy do n't carry him along and learn him ? " " Hit 's a good excuse , " she said . " Hit 's jest men-folks likin ' to prowl off together . " " Then you come make the hunt with me , sweetheart , and leave Jody here . " Jody laughed out . The picture of his mother 's great frame pushing through the bay-heads made him shout in spite of himself . " Oh go on , " she said , and laughed . " Git it over and done with . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agin , " Penny told her. 99THE YEARLING , THE YEARLING " Hit 's my only rest , " she admitted . " Leave me Grandpa 's gun loaded . " The ancient Long Tom , Jody thought , was more of a menace to her than to any intruders . She was an inaccurate and incompetentshot , and the gun was as fallible as Penny 's muzzleloader , but he could understand the comfort to her of its presence . He brought it from the shed for his father to load , grateful that she had not demanded his own newly acquired piece . Penny whistled to old Julia and the man and boy and hound set out eastward in mid-morning . The May day was warm and close . The sun beat down through the scrub . The small hard leaves of the scrub oaks were flat pans to hold the heat . The sand burned Jody 's feet through his cowhide shoes . In spite of the heat , Penny walked at a fast gait . It was all Jody could do to follow him . Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penny stopped once and stared about the horizon . Jody asked , " What you see , Pa ? " " Nothin ' , son , and very leetle o ' that . " A mile east of the clearing , he changed his direction . There were suddenly deer tracks in a great plenty . Penny studied them , for size and sex and freshness . " Here 's two big of bucks travelin ' together , " he said at last . " They come this way before day . " " How kin you tell about tracks so ? " " Jest by bein ' used to ' em . " Jody could see little difference between them and some of the other hoof-marks . Penny stooped and traced them with his finger . " Now you know to tell a doe from a buck . A doe 's track is pointed and fine . And ary one kin tell how fresh a track be , for a old track has sand blowed into it . And now if you 'll notice , a deer 's toes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together when he walks . " He indicated the fresh tracks to the hound . " Here , Julia , git him ! " I00Julia bent her long nose to the trail . It led out of the scrub , toward the south-east , into an open area of gallberry flats . Here was bear sign as well . Jody asked , " Must I shoot a bear , do I git the chancet ? " " Bear or buck , hit 's all right . Jest be sure you got a good chancet . Do n't go wastin ' your shot . " The flats were not hard going , but the sun was blazing . The gallberry bushes ended and there was a welcome stretch of pines . The shadows were cooling . Penny pointed out a bear gnaw . It was a clawed area on a tall pine tree , shoulder high to a man . The resin dripped from it . " I 've watched a bear at it , " Penny said , " many a time . He 'll stretch up and he 'll claw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nag and gnaw . Then he 'll back up and rub his shoulders agin the resin . Some folks says it 's to keep the bees from stingin ' when he robs a bee-tree , but I 've allus figgered ' t was jest a way o ' boastin ' . A buck ' 11 boast jest about the same way . He 'll rub his head and horns agin a saplin ' jest to prove hisself . " Julia lifted her nose and Penny and Jody stopped short . There was a commotion ahead . Penny motioned Julia to heel and they crept close . An opening showed and they halted . Twin bear cubs were high in a slim pine sapling , using it for a swing . The sapling was tall and limber and the yearling cubs were rocking it back and forth . Jody had swung in the same fashion . For an instant the cubs were not bears , but boys like himself . He would have liked to climb the sapling and rock with them . It bent half-way to the ground as they swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side . The cubs made now and then an amiable talking . Julia could not resist barking . The cubs stopped their play , astonished , and stared down at the humans . They were not alarmed . It was their first sight of mankind and they seemed to feel , as Jody felt , only curiosity . They cocked their black furry heads from one side to the other . One scrambled to aIOITHE YEARLING THE YEARLINGhigher limb , not for safety , but for a better view . He curled one arm around the sapling and gaped down below him . His black beady eyes were bright . " Oh Pa , " Jody begged , " let 's ketch us one . " Penny himself was tempted . " They 're a mite big for tamin ' . " He brought himself to his senses . " Now what ails us ? Jest how long would it take your Ma to run him off , and me and you with him ? " " Pa , look at him cut his eyes . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one 'll be gentleand t'other 'll be mean . " " Let 's ketch the gentle un . Please , Pa . " The cubs craned their necks . Penny shook his head . " Come along , boy . Le 's git on with our hunt and leave ' cm to their play . " He lingered behind while his father took up the bucks ' trail again . He thought once that the cubs were about to come down the sapling to him , but they only scrambled about from one limb to another and turned their heads to watch him . He ached to touch them . He imagined them sitting on their haunches and begging , as Oliver Hutto described trained bears as doing ; nesting in his lap , warm and furry and intimate ; sleeping on the foot of his bed ; even under the covers with him , if the nights were cold . His father was almost out of sight under the pines . He ran after him . He looked back over his shoulder and waved his hand to the bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air might tell them , what their eyes had not , the nature of their observers . In their first sign of alarm , he saw them clamber down the sapling and slip away to the west beyond the gallberries . He caught up to his father . " Do you ever ask your Ma into leavin ' you have sich as that , " Penny told him , " you belong to git one young enough to train easy . " IO2The thought was encouraging . The yearling cubs would indeedbe large to handle . " Now I never had nothin ' much to pet nor play with , neither , " Penny said . " There was sich a mess of us . Neither farmin ' nor the Bible pays a man too good , and Pa was like your Ma , he jest would n't feed no creeturs . He done well to fill our bellies . Then he put in and died , and since I was the oldest rat in the barn , I had to look after the rest of ' em ' til they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , a bear cub could near about make his own livin ' , could n't he ? " " Yes  --  offen your Ma 's chickens . " Jody sighed and applied himself with his father to the buck tracks . The pair of deer was keeping close together . It was odd , he thought , that the bucks could be so friendly through the spring and summer . Then when their horns were grown , and they began to run with the does in the autumn , they would drive the fawns away from the does , and battle fiercely . One buck was larger than the other . " That un there 's a buck big enough to ride , " Penny said . A patch of hammock joined the pines . Dogbane grew thickly here , lifting its yellow bells . Penny studied the multitude of tracks . " Now boy , " he said , " you been wantin ' to see fawns . Me and Julia 'll go on and make a circle . You climb up this here live oak and scrooch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethin ' . Hide your gun here in the bushes . You 'll not want it . " Jody settled himself halfway up the live oak . Penny and Julia disappeared . The shade of the oak was cool . A light breeze moved through its leaves . Jody 's shaggy hair was wet . He pushed it out of his eyes and wiped his face on his blue sleeve , then settled himself to quiet . Silence took over the scrub . Far103THE YEARLINGaway a hawk cried shrilly and was gone . No bird stirred in any branches . No creature moved or fed . No bees droned , or any insect . It was high noon . Everything living was resting in the heat of the sun 's meridian . Everything except Penny and old Julia , who moved now somewhere among the scrub oaks and the myrtle . Bushes crackled below him . He thought his father was returning . He almost betrayed himself with a quick movement . A bleat sounded . A fawn was moving from under the protection of a low clump of palmettos . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . Jody held his breath . A doe bounded over the palmettos . The fawn ran to her , wobbling on unsteady legs . She bent her head to it and made a low sound in greeting . She licked its small anxious face . It was all eyes and ears . It was spotted . Jody had never seen one so young . The doe threw up her head and tasted the air with her wide nostrils . A taint lay on it of the human enemy . She kicked up her heels and made a sortie about the live oak . She discovered the trail of hound and man . She followed it backwardand forward , throwing up her head at every few steps . She stopped and listened , her ears pricked tall above her great luminous eyes . The fawn bleated . The doe quieted . She seemed satisfied that the danger had come and gone . The fawn nuzzled her full udders and began to nurse . It butted her bag with its knobby head and switched its short tail in a gluttonous ecstasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it and moved directlyunderneath the live oak . The boughs below Jody obscured his view , but he could see that she had traced his scent to the tree and was lifting her head to locate him . Her nose followed the odor of his hands , the leather of his shoes , the sweat of his clothing , as surely as a man 's eyes followed a blazed trail . The fawn followed , greedy for the warm milk . Suddenly the doe wheeled and kicked the fawn sprawling into the bushes . She cleared them in a great bound and galloped away . I04THE YEARLINGJody scrambled down from his perch and ran to the place where he had seen the fawn tumble . It was not there . He hunted the ground carefully . The tiny hoof-marks crossed and criss-crossed and he could not tell one track from another . He sat down disconsolately to wait for his father . Penny returned , red of face and wet with sweat . " Well , son , " he called , " what did you see ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while . He nursed his mammy and she smelled me and run off . And I cai n't find the fawn no-where . You reckon Julia kin trackhim ? " Penny dropped down on the ground . " Julia kin track ary thing that makes a trail . But do n't let 's torment the leetle thing . Hit 's right clost this minute , and likely scairt to death . " " His mammy should n't of left him . " " That 's where she was smart . Most ary thing would take out after her . And she 's learned the fawn to lay up so still hit 'll not git noticed . " " Hit were mighty cute spotted , Pa . " " Was the spots all in a line , or helter-skelter ? " " They was in a line . " " Then hit 's a leetle of buck-fawn . Was n't you proud to see it so clost ? " " I was proud , but I 'd shore love to ketch him and keep him . " Penny laughed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was for once more anxious to huntthan to eat . Penny said , " We got to noon somewhere , and a deer is mighty like to run over us right here . When you noon , youjest as good to noon where the game walks . " Jody brought his gun from its hiding place and sat down to eat . He was abstracted and only the flavor of fresh brierberry jam brought him back to a consciousness of his food . The jam105THE YEARLINGwas thin and not sweet enough , sugar being scarce . Old Julia was still a little weak . She lay stretched out on her side . Her battle scars showed white against her dark hide . Penny lay on his back . He said lazily , " Them two bucks is like to circle back through here to bed up right soon , if the wind do n't change . If you was of a notion to go climb one o ' them high pine trees about a quarter to the east , hit 'd make a mighty good stand . " Jody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give anything to bring down a buck alone . Penny called after him , " Do n't try for too long a shot . Take your time . And do n't let the gun kick you outen the tree . " Tall scattered pines lifted ahead from a desolate flat of gallberrybushes . Jody chose one that commanded a view of a wide area . Nothing could cross in any direction without his seeing it . It was hard work to climb the straight trunk with the gun in one hand . His knees and shins were raw when he reached the lowest branches . He rested a moment then climbed as high as he dared in the tree-top . The pine swayed in an imperceptiblebreeze . It seemed alive , stirring with a breath of its own . He recalled the bear cubs , rocking the sapling . He began to swing his tree-top , but it was over-balanced with his weight and that of his gun . It cracked ominously and he held quiet . He looked about him . He knew now how a hawk felt , surveying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was staring , high and wise and predatory and keen . He swung his head in a slow circle . For the first time he could believe that the world was round . By turning his head quickly , he could almost see the whole horizon at once . He thought that his vision covered the entire area . He was startled to see movement . He had seen nothing approaching . But a large buck was feeding toward him . Early huckleberries were offering food . The buck was still out of range . He de-Io6THE YEARLINGbated climbing down from the pine tree and stalking it , but knew that the animal , more alert than he , would be gone before he could lift his gun . He could only wait , and pray that it would feed within a reasonable distance . It moved with a maddening slowness . For a time he thought it meant to feed away from him , to the south . Then it began to move directly toward him . He brought his gun up behind the shelter of the branches . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him whether the deer was near or far . It loomed large , yet he was conscious that such details as eyes and ears were still not plain to him . He waited for what seemed an interminable period . The buck lifted his head . Jody drew a bead on the stout neck . He pulled the trigger . At the instant that he did so , he realized that he had not made sufficient allowance for his height above the game . He had over-shot . Yet it seemed to him that he must have touched the animal , for it leaped into the air with something more than alarm . It cleared the gallberry bushes with a high bounding , making long cradled arcs . It passed directly under the pine-tree . If he had had his father 's new double-barreled gun , he would have had another shot . In a few seconds he heard Penny 's gun . He was quivering . He climbed down from the pine and pushed his way back to the patch of hammock . The buck lay in the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing . Jody called , " Did I hit him ? " " You hit him . You done a mighty good job . Like as not , he 'd of fell a piece on , but I takened a shot at him as he come by , jest to make sure . You was a might high . " " I know it . The minute I shot , I knowed I was high . " " Well , that 's the way you learn . Next time , you 'll know . Now here 's your shot , here , and there 's mine . " Jody knelt down to examine the fine frame . Again , a sicknesscame over him at the sight of the glazed eyes and the bleeding throat . 107THE YEARLINGHe said , " I wisht we could git our meat without killin ' it . " " Hit 's a pity , a'right . But we got to eat . " Penny was working deftly . His hunting knife , a flat sawfileground down to an edge , with only a corn-cob for handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn the venison and cut off the heavy head . He skinned it below the knees , crossed the legs and tied them , slipped his arms through the junctures , and stood up with the carcass neatly balanced on his back for carrying . " Now Boyles may want the hide when we skin it out at Volusia , " he said , " but if you 'd like to carry the hide to GrandmaHutto for a present , we 'll jest refuse him . " " I reckon she 'd be proud to have it for a rug , a'right . I wisht I 'd shot it by myself , to give her . " " That 's jest all right . The hide 's yours . I 'll carry her a forequarter , for my portion . She 's got nobody but us to hunt for her , with Oliver gone to sea . That mindless Yankee hangs around her is no good for sich as that . " Penny said innocently , " Now mebbe you 'd ruther carry the hide to your sweetheart . " Jody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sweetheart . " " You ai n't goin ' back on Eulalie after I seed you holdin ' hands at the doin 's ? " " I was not holdin ' hands . It was a game they was playin ' . If you say that agin , Pa , I 'll jest die . " Penny seldom teased his son , but now and then an occasion was irresistible . " Grandma 's my sweetheart , " Jody said . " All right . I jest wanted to git it straight . " The sand road was long and hot . Penny was wet with sweat , but he walked easily under his burden . Jody said , " Kin I tote it a ways ? " but Penny shook his head . " These fellers only fits a man 's back , " he said . They crossed Juniper Creek , then , after two miles of narrowIo8THE YEARLINGroad , picked up the main road to the river and to Volusia . Penny stopped to rest . In late afternoon they passed Captain McDonald 's house and Jody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the road , the dry growth of pines and scrub oak disappeared . There was a new lushness . Sweet gums and bay were here , and , like sign-posts indicating the river , cypress . Wild azaleas were blooming late in the low places , and the passion flower opened its lavender corollas along the road . They reached the St. John 's River . It was dark and aloof . It seemed to slide toward the ocean indifferent to its own banks and to the men who crossed or used it . Jody stared at it . It was a pathway to the world . Penny shouted across it to summon the ferry from the Volusia side . A man crossed over for them with a rough raft of hewn logs . They crossed back , watching the slow sweep of the river current . Penny paid his ferryage and they walked up the curving shell road and into the Volusia store . Penny hailed the proprietor , " Howdy , Mr. Boyles . How dc this feller look to you ? " " Too good for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's venison worth ? " " The same . A dollar and a half a saddle . I 'll swear , those city folks travelling up and down the river  --  Hollering for venison and ' tai n't half as good as pork , and you and me , we know it . ' Penny hauled the deer to the big meat block and began the skinning . " Yes , " he agreed , " but if a feller 's pot-bellied and cai n't gil out and shoot it for hisself , I reckon venison has a might ) fancy taste to him . " They laughed together . Penny was a welcome trader at the store , as much for his wit and his stories , as his business . Boyle : himself was judge and arbiter and encyclopedia for the smal community . He stood now in the close odorous dusk of hi : store like a captain in the hold of his ship . His wares includec109THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGthe necessities and scanty luxuries of the whole country-side , from plows , wagons , buggies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry goods and notions and medicines . " Now one fore-quarter I 'll call back by for tomorrer to carry home to my wife . T' other one goes to Grandma Hutto , " Penny said . " Bless her old soul , " Boyles said . " Why I say old soul ' I do n't know . If a man 's wife was as young-hearted as Grandma Hutto , why , living 'd be a feast . " Jody walked along the length of the glass case under the counter . There were sweet crackers and an assortment of candies . There were Barlow knives and the new Rogers . There were shoe-strings , buttons , thread and needles . The coarser wares were on shelves that lined the walls . Buckets and pitchers , lard-oil lamps and basins , the new kerosene lamps , coffee pots and cast-iron skillets and Dutch ovens , nestled together like strange birds , fledglings in one nest . Beyond the utensils were the dress goods ; calico and Osnaburg , denim and shoddy , domesticand homespun . A few bolts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was little sale for such luxuries , especially in the summer . At the back of the store were the groceries , hams and cheeses and bacons . There were barrels of sugar and flour and meal and grits and green coffee beans ; sacks of potatoes ; kegs of syrup ; barrels of whiskey . Nothing here was tempting and Jody wandered back to the glass case . A rusty mouth organ lay on top of a pile of licorice strings . He was tempted for a moment to trade in his deer hide and buy the mouth organ , so that he could play to Grandma Hutto or accompany the Forresters . But Grandma would probably prefer the deer hide . Boyles called to him . " Young man , your daddy does n't come to trade too often . I 'll treat you to a dime 's worth of anything you take a notion to . " IIoHe looked over the assortment hungrily . " I reckon the mouth organ 's wuth more'n a dime . " " Well , yes , but it 's been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jody cast a last look at the candies . But Grandma Hutto would have sweets for him . He said , " Thank you , sir . " Boyles said , " Your boy 's mannerly , Mr. Baxter . " " He 's right smart of a comfort , " Penny said . " We lost so many young uns , I think sometimes I set too much store by him . " Jody glowed with a sense of virtue . He longed to be good and noble . He turned back of the counter to garner the reward of his character . He glanced up at a motion by the door . Boyles ' niece , Eulalie , stood gaping at him . He was flooded instantly with hate . He hated her because his father had teased him . He hated her hair , hanging in tight pig-tails . He hated her freckles , more lavish than his own . He hated her squirrel-teeth , her hands , her feet , and every bone in her lank body . He leaned over swiftly and picked a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him venomously . Slowly , she flickered her tongue at him like a garter snake . She clasped two fingers over her nose in a gesture of malodorous disgust . He hurled the potato . It struck her on the shoulder and she retreated with shrieks of anguish . Penny said , " Why , Jody . " Boyles advanced , frowning . Penny said sternly , " Git right outen here . Mr. Boyles , he cai n't have the mouth organ . " He went outside into the hot sunlight . He was humiliated . Yet if he had it to do over again , he would throw another potatoat her , a larger one . When his business was done , Pennyjoined him . He said , " I 'm sorry you seed fit to shame me . Mebbe your IIITHE YEARLINGMa 's right . Mebbe you had n't ought to have no truck with the Forresters . " Jody scuffled his feet in the sand . " I do n't keer . I hate her . " " I do n't know what to say . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I jest hate her . She made a face at me . She 's ugly . " " Well , son , you cai n't go thru life chunkin ' things at all the ugly women you meet . " Jody spat unrepentant in the sand . " Well , " Penny said , " I do n't know what Grandma Hutto 'll say . " " Oh Pa , do n't tell her . Please do n't tell her . " Penny was ominously silent . " I 'll be mannerly , Pa . " " I do n't know whether she 'll take this hide from you now or not . " " Leave me have it , Pa . I 'll not chunk nothin ' at nobody agin , if you 'll not tell Grandma . " " All right . This time . But do n't let me ketch you at sich as that agin . Take your deer-hide . " His spirits lifted . The menacing cloud moved away . They turned north up a path that paralleled the river . Magnolias were in bloom along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These too were blossoming . Red-birds flew ahead down the lane . The oleanders led to a gate in a white picket fence . Grandma Hutto 's flower garden was a bright patchwork quilt thrown down inside the pickets . Her small white cottage was bound to the substantial earth with vines of honeysuckle and jessamine . Everything here was dear and familiar . Jody ran down thepath through the garden ; through the patch of indigo , in feathery , rose-lavender bloom . He called , " Hey ! Grandma ! " THE YEARLINGLight steps sounded inside the cottage and she was on the door-step . " Jody ! You scamp . " He ran to her . Penny called , " Do n't knock her down , boy . " She braced her small frame . He squeezed her until she squeaked . " You tormented bear cub , " she said . She began to laugh , and he tipped back his head to laugh with her and watch her face . It was pink and wrinkled . Her eyes were as black as gallberries . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippled out from the sides . She shook up and down , and her small plump breast quivered like a quail dusting . Jody sniffed at her like a puppy . He said , " Ummm , Grandma , you smell good . " Penny said , " That 's more'n you kin say for us , Grandma . We 're a dirty pair o ' somebodies . " " ' Tai n't nothin ' but huntin ' smell , " Jody said . " Deer-hide and leaves and sich . And sweatin ' . " " It 's a dandy smell , " she said . " I 'm jest lonesome for boysmelland man-smell . " Penny said , " Anyway , here 's our excuse-us . Fresh venison . " " And the hide , " Jody said . " For a rug for you . Hit 's mine . I wounded it . " She lifted her hands in the air . Their gifts became at once of great value . It seemed to Jody that he could bring in a panther single-handed , in return for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Now do n't dirty them leetle hands . " She drew gallantry from men as the sun drew water . Her pertness enchanted them . Young men went away from her with a feeling of bravado . Old men were enslaved by her silver curls . Something about her was forever female and made all menTHE YEARLINGvirile . Her gift infuriated all women . Ma Baxter had returned to the clearing from her four years in her house with an acute dislike . The older woman returned it with good measure . Penny said , " Leave me tote the meat to the kitchen . And I 'd best tack the hide to your shed wall , to cure for you . " Jody called , " Here , Fluff ! " The white dog came racing . He bounded at Jody like a ball and leaped at his face to lick it . Grandma said , " He 's as proud to see you as if ' t was some of his kin-folks . " Fluff caught sight of old Julia , sitting sedately on her haunches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring , her long ears drooping . Grandma said , " I like that dog . She looks jest like my Aunt Lucy . " Penny went to the rear of the cottage with the venison and the hide . They were all welcome here , father and son and battle-scarredhound . Jody felt more at home than when he returned to his own mother . He said , " I reckon you would n't be so proud to see me , did you have to put up with me all the time . " Grandma chuckled . " You 've heard your Ma say that . Did she quarrel about you comin ' ? " " Not so turrible as sometimes . " " Your father , " she said tartly , " married a woman all Hell could n't amuse . " She lifted a finger in the air . " I 'll bet you want to go swimmin ' . " " In the river ? " " Smack in the river . When you come out , I 'll give you clean clothes . Some of Oliver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moccasins or 114THE YEARLINGagainst the river current . It was good to have it taken for granted that he had a little sense of his own . He ran down the path to the landing . The river flowed deep and dark . It made a rippling sound against the banks , but the great liquid heart of it moved silently . Only the swift progress of fallen leaves showed the current . Jody hesitated a moment on the wooden landing , then dove in . He came up gasping with the coldness and struck upstream . He kept close to the bank , where the currentran less swiftly . He made almost no progress . The dark vegetation towered on either side of the river . He was pinned between banks of live oaks and cypresses . He pretended that an alligator was behind him and swam desperately . He passed one spot and then , laboriously , another , dog-paddling . He wondered if he could swim as far as the upper landing , where the ferry crossed and the river steamers halted . He fought his way toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it and caught his wind . He set out again . The landing looked far away . His shirt and breeches interfered with his freedom . He wished he had gone in naked . Grandma would not have minded . He wondered what his mother would have said if he had told her the Forresters had played and sung naked . He looked over his shoulder . Hutto 's landing had disappeared around the bend . He was suddenly not happy in the fluid darkness . He turned around . The current caught him and he shot downstream . He struggled to approach the bank . Waterytentacles held him . He thought in a panic that he might be swept on to Volusia Bar , to great Lake George itself , even , perhaps , the sea . He fought blindly , reaching for whatever might be solid under him . He found himself grounding a little above the landing . In relief , he drifted cautiously down to it and climbed up on the wooden platform . He drew a deep breath . The panic left him and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the landing . I15THE YEARLINGHis father said , " That were right smart of a tussle . Reckon I 'll jest ease around the edge to git me my wash . " He dropped cautiously from the landing . He said , " Now I do n't aim to take my feet offen the ground . My day for capers is over . " He came out of the water shortly . They returned to the rear of the cottage . Grandma Hutto had clean clothes waiting for them . For Penny , there were garments of the long-dead Mr. Hutto , musty with age . For Jody , there were shirt and breeches that Oliver had worn and outgrown many years ago . Grandma said , " They say you git to use things again , if you save them , ever ' seven years . How many is two times seven , Jody ? " " Fourteen . " Penny said , " Do n't ask him no further . That school teacher me and the Forresters boarded last winter did n't scarcely know , hisself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than book-learnin ' . " " I know that , but a feller needs to know to read and write and figger . But Jody 's gittin ' along right good with what I kin make out to learn him . " They dressed in the shed . They smoothed back their hair with their hands and felt clean and strange in the borrowed clothing . Jody 's freckled face shone . His tawny hair lay wet and smooth . They put on their own shoes and wiped away the dust with their discarded shirts . Grandma Hutto called to them and they went into the cottage . Jody smelled its familiar odor . He had never been able to disentangle its elements . The sweet lavender she used on her clothing was plain . There were dried grasses in a jar before the fire-place . There was the unmistakable smell of honey , which she kept in a cupboard . There was pastry ; tarts and cookies and fruit cakes . There was the smell of the soap she used on Fluff 's fur . There was the pervasive scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above it all , it came to him at last , lay the smell of the river . The river itself was fluid through the cottage and around it , leaving a whirlpool of odorousdampness and decaying fern . He looked through the open door . A path led through marigolds to the water . The river shone in the late sunlight , Guinea-gold , like the bright flowers . Its flow drew Jody 's mind with it to the ocean , where Oliver rode the storms in ships , and knew the world . Grandma brought Scuppernong wine and spice cakes . Jody was allowed a glass of wine . It was as clear as Juniper Springs . Penny smacked his lips over it , but Jody wished it was somethingsweeter , blackberry shrub , perhaps . He ate spice cakes absently , and stopped in shame to see that he had emptied the plate . This , at home , would be catastrophe . Grandma went to the cupboard and filled the plate again . She said , " Do n't you spoil your dinner . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She went to the kitchen and he followed her . She began to slice venison to broil . He frowned anxiously . The meat was no great treat to the Baxters . She opened the oven door and he became aware that other things were being cooked . She had an iron cook stove . Food from it was more mysterious than from the open hearth at home . The closed door concealed all manner of things behind its black bosom . The cake had dulled his appetite a little , but the good odors brought it back again . He wandered back and forth from Grandma to his father . Penny sat sunk in quiet in a padded chair in the front room . Shadows lay over him and absorbed him . There was not here the excitement of a visit to the Forresters . There was instead a snugness that covered him like a warm quilt in winter . It was meat and drink to Penny , harassed at home by all his duties . Jody offered to help in the kitchen , but Grandma sent him away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old Julia watched them wonderingly . Romping was as alien to herI17THE YEARLING U THE YEARLINGas to her master . Her black and tan face wore the solemnity of the work-dog . Dinner was ready . Grandma Hutto was the only person Jody knew who had a separate room to eat in . Every one else ate in the kitchen , from a scrubbed and bare pine table . Even as she brought in the food , he could not take his eyes from the white cloth and the blue plates . Penny said , " Now we 're a mighty sorry pair o ' tramps to set down to all these pretties . " But he joked and gossiped with Grandma with an ease he did not have at his own table . He said to her , " I 'm surprised your sweetheart ai n't showed up yit . " Her black eyes snapped . " Anybody but you said that , Penny Baxter , he 'd get pitched in the river . " " The way you done pore Easy hisself , eh ? " " Pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when he 's insulted . " " You 'll be obliged to take him yit , to give you the legal right to throw him out . " Jody laughed boisterously . He could not listen to them and eat at the same time . He found himself getting behind and settled down to steady eating . There was a bass , fresh from Easy 's fish-trap in the river , baked whole with a savory stuffing . The Irish potatoes were a treat , after the Baxter sweet potatoes three times a day . There was early mutton corn . The Baxters seldom ate new corn , for all that was raised seemed more desperately needed for the stock . Jody sighed with his inability to hold everything . He concentrated on light bread and mayhaw jelly . Penny said , " He 'll be so spoiled , his Mall have to break him in like a new bird-dog . " After dinner they walked together through the garden toI18the river bank . Boats passed . The travellers waved to Grandma and she waved back . Toward sunset Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening chores . Grandma eyed her approaching admirer . " Now do n't he look like the back end o ' bad luck ? " Jody thought that Easy looked like a sick gray crane , with feathers draggled by the rain . His hair hung in gray wisps in his neck . He had a long thin gray mustache that drooped to his jaws . His arms hung like limp wings at his sides . " Look at him , " she said . " Tormented Yankee . His feet drag like a ' gator 's tail . " " He shore ai n't purty , " Penny admitted , " but he 's humble as a dog . " " I hate a pitiful man , " she said . " And I hate anything is bow-legged . He 's so bow-legged his breeches near about make a mark on the ground . " Easy shuffled back of the house . Jody heard him with the cow , and later at the wood-pile . When the evening 's work was done , he came timidly to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He cleared his throat . Then as though his Adam 's apple , working up and down , blocked his words , he gave up trying to speak and sat down on the bottom step . The talk flowed about him , and his gray face was bright with content . At twilight , Grandma disappeared inside the house . Easy rose stiffly to go . He said to Penny , " My , if I could talk like you . Maybe she 'd take to me better . You s'pose it 's that , or wo n't she never forgive me , bein ' a Yankee ? If ' t was that , I 'll declare , Penny , I 'd spit on the flag . " " Well , you know a woman 'll hold a idee like a ' gator 'll hold a shoat . She cai n't fergit the time the Yankees takened her needles and thread and she walked clean to St. Augustine with three hen 's eggs to trade for a paper o ' needles . Now if the Yankeeshad got beat , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was beat , Penny . I myself was beat something awful . It was at Bull Run . You rebels whipped us something terrible . My , I hated it . " His memories overcame him . He wiped his eyes . " You whipped us , and we was two to your one ! " He shuffled away . " Now think o ' that beat-down human aspirin ' to Grandma , " Penny said . " He 's shore got a low eye for a high fence . " Inside the cottage , Penny tormented Grandma about Easy , as he had tormented Jody about Eulalie . But she gave back as good as she took , and the bout was good-natured . The subject reminded Jody of the matter that had been on his conscience . He said , " Grandma , Lem Forrester said Twink Weatherby was his gal . I said she was Oliver 's , and Lem did n't like it no leetle bit . " " Oliver 'll likely take care o ' Lem when he comes home , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She put them to bed in a room as white as the snow that Oliver told of . Jody stretched out beside his father between immaculatesheets . He said , " Do n't Grandma live nice ? " Penny said , " Hit 's a way some women has . " He added loyally , " But do n't think hard o ' your Ma for not doin ' like Grandma . Your Ma ai n't never had nothin ' much to do with , and I 'm to blame for that , not her . She cai n't he'p it , livin ' rough . " Jody said , " I wisht Grandma was really my Grandma . I wisht Oliver was shore enough kin . " " Well , folks that seems like kin-folks , is kin-folks . You ruther live here with Grandma ? " Jody pictured the cabin in the clearing . Hoot-owls would be crying , and perhaps the wolves would howl , or a panther scream . The deer would be drinking at the sink-hole , the bucks alone , the does with their fawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds together . There was something at Bax-I20THE YEARLINGter 's Island that was better than white tablecloths and counterpanes . " No , I 'd not . I 'd jest like to take Grandma home to live withus . But we 'd have to make Ma mind her . " Penny chuckled . " Pore boy , " he said , " has got to grow up and learnwomenI2IJODY heard the freight and passenger steamer pass the Hutto landing about daylight . He sat up in bed and looked out of the window . The lights of the steamer were pale under the early morning sky . The paddle wheels churned thickly through the water . The steamer blew its thin high whistle at Volusia . He thought he heard it stop and then go on up the river . Somehow , its passing concerned him . He could not go to sleep again . Outside in the yard old Julia growled . Penny stirred from his sleep . Watchfulness lived sentinel in his brain . Sounds no heavier than the wind aroused him . He said , " The steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked deeply , then whined and was still . " Hit 's somebody she knows . " Jody cried , " Hit 's Oliver ! " and jumped from the bed . I22THE YEARLINGHe ran naked through the cottage . Fluff awakened and dashed from his bed by Grandma 's door , barking shrilly . A voice shouted , " Turn out , you lazy landlubbers ! " Grandma ran from her bedroom . She had on a long white nightgown and a white nightcap . She fastened a shawl around her shoulders as she ran . Oliver took the steps in one bound like a buck and Jody and his mother were on him in a whirlwind . He lifted his mother by the waist and swung her . She thumped him with her small fists . Jody and Fluff yelped for attention . Oliver swung them in turn . Penny joined them sedately , fully dressed . They pumped hands in greeting . In the dim light of dawn , Oliver 's teeth flashed white . Grandma 's eye caught another flashing . " Now you jest give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip-toe to reach up to his ears . Gold hoops swung from the lobes . She unscrewed them and put them in her own ears . He laughed and shook her and Fluff barked in a frenzy . In the tumult , Penny spoke . " Lord save us , Jody , you 're plumb naked . " Jody froze in his tracks . He turned to run . Oliver caught him . Grandma pulled the shawl from her shoulders and tied it around his waist . She said , " I 'd of run naked , too , if I 'd had to . Oliver do n't come home but twice a year , do he , boy ? " He said , " Hit was dark when I set out , anyways . " The commotion quieted . Oliver picked up his duffel-bag and carried it inside . Jody trailed him . " Where you been to this time , Oliver ? Did you see whales ? " Penny said , " Leave the man ketch his breath , Jody . He cain'tturn out tales for young uns like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his tales . " That 's what a sailor comes home for , " he said . " To see his Ma and his gal and to tell lies . " His ship had been in the tropics . Jody tore himself away123THE YEARLINGlong enough to slip into his borrowed shirt and breeches . He called questions and Grandma called questions . The homecorneranswered back and forth . Grandma dressed in a flowereddimity and arranged her silver curls with special care . She went to the kitchen to start breakfast . Oliver opened the mouth of his duffel-bag and dumped the contents in the middle of the floor . Grandma said , " I ca n't look and cook at the same time . " Oliver said , " Then for the Lord 's sake , Ma , cook . " " You 're thin . " " I 'm skin and bones , waitin ' to get home to eat . " " Jody , come get that fire to roarin ' . Slice that ham . Slice that bacon . Slice that venison . " She took bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , then ran back to Oliver . The sun rose and flooded the cottage . Oliver and Penny and Jody squatted on their haunches over the contents of the duffel-bag . Oliver said , " I 've got somethin ' for everybody but Jody . Funny , I forgot him . " " You did n't . You ai n't never yit forgot me . " " See can you pick out your present . " Jody passed over a roll of silk . That was of course for Grandma . He pushed aside Oliver 's clothes , spiced and musty with strange foreign odors . A small packet was wrapped in flannel . Oliver took it out of his hands . " That 's for my gal . " A loose sack was filled with agates and translucent stones . Jody passed on . He lifted a parcel to his nose . " T'baccy ! " " For your Pa . From Turkey . " " Why , Oliver . " Penny opened it , marvelling . The rich aroma drifted across the room . " Why , Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a present . " Jody pinched a long narrow bundle . It was heavy and metallic. 124THE YEARLING " This is it ! " " You ca n't tell without seein ' it . " Jody unwrapped the bundle madly . A hunting knife fell to the floor . The blade was keen and shining . Jody stared . " Not a knife , Oliver " " Now if you 'd rather have one of them ground-down files like your Pa has " Jody pounced . He swung the long blade to catch the light . " There ai n't nobody in the scrub , " he said , " has got sich as that . Not even the Forresters has got sich a knife . " " That 's what I figured . We ca n't let them black-beards get ahead of us . " Jody looked at the small flannel-swathed parcel Oliver held in one hand . He was torn between Oliver and the Forresters . He burst out , " Oliver  --  Lem Forrester says Twink Weatherbyis his gal . " Oliver laughed and tossed the parcel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Forrester ever told the truth . Nobody takes my gal away from me . " Jody felt a wave of relief . He had told both Grandma and Oliver and washed his conscience clear , and Oliver was not disturbed . Then a memory came to him of Lem 's dark face , broodingand sullen , as he scraped the strings of his fiddle . He put the picture from him . He sunk himself in the treasures his friend had brought home from far places across the sea . Grandma , he noticed , did not touch her plate at breakfast . She kept Oliver 's filled . Her bright eyes hovered over her son like hungry swallows . Oliver sat tall and straight at the table . His skin was bronzed where his shirt was open over his lean throat . His hair was sun-burned , with a red light in it . His eyes were the color which Jody imagined was the color of the sea , gray-blue , with a flashing of green . Jody ran his hand over his own snub nose and freckled skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head , where the straw-colored drake'stailsstuck out stiffly . He was immensely dissatisfied with himself . He asked , " Grandma , was Oliver borned good-lookin ' ? " Penny said , " I kin answer that . I kin remember when he was uglier'n you and me both . " Oliver said complacently , " You 'll grow up handsome as I am , Jody , if that 's what 's botherin ' you . " " Jest half as handsome 'd do , " he said . Oliver said , " I 'll call you in to tell that to my gal today . " Grandma wrinkled her nose . " Sailors belong to do their courtin ' before they come home , " she said . " From what I hear , " Penny offered , " sailors do n't never quit courtin ' . " " How about you , Jody ? " Oliver asked . " You got a sweetheart yet ? " Penny said , " Why , ai n't you heered , Oliver ? Jody 's sweet on Eulalie Boyles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to roar like the Forresters and frighten every one with his rage . He stuttered . " I  --  I hate girls . I hate Eulalie most of all . " Oliver said innocently , " Why , what 's the matter with her ? " " I hate her of twitchy nose . She looks like a rabbit . " Oliver and Penny shouted and slapped each other . Grandma said , " Now quit tormentin ' the boy , both of you . Ca n't you remember that fur back , yourselves ? " His venom melted under his gratitude to her . Grandma was the only one who ever stood up for him . No , he thought , that was not true . Penny himself usually helped him fight his battles . When his mother was unreasonable , Penny always said , " Leave him be , Ory . I remember when I were a boy  --  " It came to him that his father only teased him here , in the hands126of friends . When he needed help , Penny never failed him . Hegrinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare you tell Ma I got a gal . She 'd rare worse'n if I had me a varmint . " Grandma said , " Your Ma rares at you , do she ? " " At me and Pa both . Worse at Pa . " " She do n't appreciate him , " she said . " She jest do n't know any better . " She sighed . " A woman has got to love a bad man once or twice in her life , to be thankful for a good one . " Penny stared modestly at the floor . Jody was consumed with curiosity as to whether Mr. Hutto had been good or bad . He dared not ask . At any rate , Mr. Hutto had been so long dead that he supposed it no longer mattered . Oliver rose and stretched his long legs . Grandma said , " You leavin ' me , the very minute you gethome ? " " Just for a little while . I got to go around and get acquainted in the neighborhood again . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He leaned over her and tousled her curls . " Penny , youallai n't goin ' home today ? " " We got to do our tradin ' and head for the scrub , Oliver . I hate it , I hate to miss the Sat'day frolic . We come on a Friday so 's to git our venison to Boyles in time for the north boat today . And ' tai n't right to leave Ory alone too long . " " No , " Grandma said . " A panther might get her . " Penny looked at her quickly , but she was arranging the folds of her apron with great care . Oliver said , " Well , see you over the river . " He was gone , slapping his sailor 's cap on the back of his head . His whistle sounded after him . Jody was desolate . Somethingwould happen to keep him from hearing Oliver 's tales . He could feel it . He would have liked to sit on the river bank all morning while Oliver yarned . He had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some one came , or Oliver stopped to do something else , and never finished . " I ai n't never yit had me a bait o ' stories , " he said . Grandma said , " I 've never had him long enough , neither . " Penny loitered over his leaving . " I hate to leave , " he said , " pertickler , now Oliver 's here . " " I miss Oliver worse , " she said , " when he 's here , and away from me , than when he 's at sea . " Jody said , " Hit 's Twink . Hit 's gals does it . I do n't never aim to have no gal . " He was resentful of Oliver 's leaving them . The four of them made a close community , and Oliver had torn it to tatters . Penny basked in the peace of the cottage . He filled his pipe again and again with the foreign tobacco . He said , " I do hate it , but we got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit 's a fur piece home , a-foot . " Jody walked along the river bank and threw sticks for Fluff . He saw Easy Ozell running toward the cottage . Easy called , " Git your Pa quick . Do n't let Mis ' Hutto hear . " Jody ran through the garden and called his father . Penny came outside . Easy panted , " Oliver 's fightin ' the Forresters . He took a crack at Lem outside the store and all them fightin ' Forresters come down on him . They 're killin ' him . " Penny ran for the store . Jody could not keep up with him . Easy trailed behind both of them . Penny called over his shoulder , " I hope we kin settle it afore Grandma gits into it with a gun . " Jody called , " Pa , we fightin ' for Oliver ? " " We 're fightin ' for whoever 's takin ' a lickin ' and that 's Oliver . " Jody 's brain whirled like a wind-mill . He said , " Pa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island without the Forresters was his friends . " I28THE YEARLING " I said so . But I ai n't goin ' to see Oliver hurt . " Jody was numb . It seemed to him that Oliver deserved his punishment . He had gone away and left them , to see a girl . He was almost glad the Forresters were after him . Perhaps Oliver would come home from the fight and be done with his nonsense . Twink Weatherby  --  Jody spat into the sand . He thought of Fodder-wing . He could not bear never to be friends with him again . He called to his father 's back , " I ai n't goin ' to fight for Oliver . " Penny did not answer . His short legs churned . The fight was in the sandy road in front of the Boyles store . A cloud of dust rose ahead , like a whirlwind in the heat of summer . Jody heard the shouting of the watchers before he could make out the figures of the fighters . All of Volusia was there . Penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keer who 's kilt , long as they git to see a fight . " Jody saw Twink Weatherby on the outer circle . Men and women all called her pretty , but he wanted to tear out her soft yellow curls , one by one . Her small pointed face was white . Her wide blue eyes were fixed on the fighters . She twisted a handkerchief around and around in her fingers . Penny pushed his way through the crowd . Jody followed behind him . He clutched at his father 's shirt . It was true . The Forresters were killing Oliver . Oliver was fighting three of them at once , Lem and Mill-wheel and Buck . He looked like a buck deer Jody had once seen , wounded and bleeding , with the dogs tearing flesh from its throat and shoulders . Blood and sand covered his face . He was boxing warily , trying to take on one Forrester at a time . Lem and Buck rushed in on him together . Jody heard a heavy fist crack against bone . Oliver dropped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confusion . Oliver deserved it , for leaving the cottage and going to a girl . But three against one129THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGwas never fair . Even when the dogs bayed a bear or panther , it seemed to him an uneven matter . The Forresters , his mother said , were black-hearted . He had never believed her . They sang and drank and frolicked and guffawed . They fed him lavishlyand slapped him on the back and gave him Fodder-wing to play with . Was this black-hearted , for three to fight together against one ? Yet Mill-wheel and Buck were fighting for Lem , keeping his girl for him . Was not that good ? Was that not loyal ? Oliver came to his knees , then wavered to his feet . He smiled through the dirt and blood . Jody 's stomach turned over . Oliver was being killed . Jody jumped on Lem 's back . He clawed at his neck and thumped his head . Lem shook him off and turned and sent him sprawling . His face stung from the impact of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lem snapped , " You keep outen this , you leetle panther . " Penny called loudly , " Who 's judgin ' this fight ? " Lem said , " We 're judgin ' it . " Penny pushed in front of him . His voice was high against the shouting . " If it take three men to whop one , I say that one is the betterman . " Lem advanced on him . He said , " I 'm o ' no mind to kill you , Penny Baxter . But I'llsmack you flat as a skeeter if you do n't git outen my way . " Penny said , " Fair is fair . If you aim to kill Oliver , shoot himhonest and hang for murder . But be men . " Buck shuffled his feet in the sand . He said , " We 'd of fit him one at a time , but he lit right in . " Penny pressed his advantage . " Whose fight is it ? Who done what to who ? " Lem said , " He come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oliver wiped his sleeve across his face . He said , " It 's Lem that tried to steal . " " Steal what ? " Penny pounded one fist inside the other . " Hounds , hogs , guns , or horses ? " On the outer rim , Twirrk Weatherby began to cry . Oliver said in a low voice , " This is no place to tell it , Penny . " " Then be this the place to fight it out ? Like a pack o ' dogs fightin ' in the road ? You two fellers fight it out alone another day . " Oliver said , " I 'll fight a man anywhere , that says what Lem said . " Lem said , " And I 'll say it again . " They started together . Penny pushed between them . He seemed to Jody like a small stout pine tree , bending against a hurricane . The crowd roared . Lem drew back his fist and struck Oliver over Penny 's head . The blow sounded like the crack of a rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lay still . Penny brought his knuckles under Lem 's jaw . Buck and Mill-wheel came at him from the sides . Lem sunk his fist in Penny 's ribs . Jody moved with a fury that caught him up from the outside , like a strong wind . He sunk his teeth in Lem 's wrist . He kicked the big shins . Lem turned , like a bear annoyed by a puppy . He knocked Jody clear of his feet . It seemed to him that Lem struck him again in mid-air . He saw Oliver sway to his feet . He saw Penny 's arms swinging like flails . He heard a roaring . It was close at first , then it faded . He dropped into blackness.  --  13  --  JoDY thought , " I dreamed the fighting . " He stared at the ceiling in Grandma Hutto 's spare bedroom . A freight steamer was thrashing up-stream . He heard the side-wheel paddles drinking the swift current of the river . They gulped great wet mouthfuls and let it spill out again . The steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only now awakened in the morning . The steamer 's chugging filled the river bed and beat against the western wall that was the scrub . He had had a nightmare about Oliver Hutto , coming home to fight the Forresters . He turned his head to look out of the window and watch the passing vessel . A sharp pain shot through his neck and shoulder . He could only turn his head part-way . Memory went through him , thrusting like the pain . He thought , " The fighting was true . " 132THE YEARLINGIt was afternoon . The sun shone in the west across the river . A bright band lay across the counterpane . The pain stopped , but he felt faint and dizzy . There was movement in the room . A rocker creaked . Grandma Hutto said , " His eyes are open . " He tried to turn his head toward her voice but could not , withoutpain . She leaned over him . He said , " Hey , Grandma . " She spoke , not to him , but to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . " Penny appeared on the other side of the bed . One wrist was bandaged and one eye was black . He grinned at Jody . He said , " We was a big help , you and me . " A cold wet cloth slipped from Jody 's forehead . Grandma took it away and laid her hand in its place . She reached her fingers back of his head and felt carefully for the source of pain . It was in his left jaw , where Lem had struck him , and in the back of his head , where he had hit the sand . It eased under her slow manipulation . She said , " Say somethin ' , so I 'll know your brains ai n't jellied . " " I cai n't think o ' nothin ' to say . " He added , " Ai n't it past dinner-time ? " Penny said , " The only serious hurt could come to him , is likely his belly . " He said , " I ai n't hongry . I jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " That 's all right , Punkin . " He asked , " Where 's Oliver ? " " In the bed . " " Is he bad hurted ? " " Not bad enough to learn him sense . " " I do n't know now , " Penny said . " One more clip , and he 'd not of had much left to learn with . " 133THE YEARLING " Anyway , he 's spoiled his pretty looks so no yellow-headed thing ' ! ! look at him for a while . " " You women is right smart hard on one another , " Penny said . " Seems to me ' t was Oliver and Lem done most o ' the lookin ' . " Grandma rolled up the cold cloth and left the bedroom . Penny said , " ' Twa' n't noways fair , gittin ' a young un knocked dead . But I 'm proud you was man enough to mix in it , when you seed a friend in trouble . " Jody stared at the sunlight . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As though he read his thoughts , Penny said , " This 'll likely end neighborin ' with the Forresters . " A twinge of pain shot from Jody 's head into the pit of his stomach . He could not give up Fodder-wing . He decided that he would slip away some time and call to Fodder-wing from the bushes . He pictured the secret meeting . Perhaps they would be discovered and Lem would whip them both to death . Then Oliver would be sorry he had fought because of Twink Weatherby . Jody was more resentful at Oliver than at the Forresters . Something of Oliver that had belonged to him , and to Grandma , had been taken away and given to the yellowheadedgirl who wrung her hands over the fighting . Yet if he had it to do over again , he would still have to help Oliver . He recalled a wild-cat that the dogs had torn to pieces . Wild-cats deserved what they got . Yet at one moment , when the snarling mouth had gaped wide in agony , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed with pity . He had cried out , longing to help the creature in its torture . Too much pain was unjust . Too many against one were unjust . That was why it had been necessary to fight for Oliver , even if it lost him Fodder-wing . He closed his eyes , satisfied . Everything was all right when he understood it . Grandma came into the bedroom with a tray. 134THE YEARLING " Now , Punkin , see can you sit up . " Penny slipped his hands under the pillow and Jody eased up slowly . He was stiff and sore , but he felt no worse than the time he had fallen out of the chinaberry tree . Penny said , " I wisht pore Oliver had got off this light . " Grandma said , " He 's lucky he did n't get his fine nose broke . " He ate his way painfully toward a plate of gingerbread . Becauseof the soreness , he was forced to leave a square . He lookedat it . Grandma said , " I 'll save that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a treat , to have a woman reads your mind and then agrees with it . " " I mean . " Jody lay against his pillow . Violence broke into peace , and tore the world to tatters , and then , suddenly , all was peaceful again . Penny said , " I got to be pushin ' on . Ory 'll be rarin ' . " He stood in the doorway . He was a little stooped . He looked lonely . Jody said , " I want to go with you . " Penny 's face grew bright . He said , " Now , boy . " He was eager . " You shore you 're fitten ? Tell you what I 'll do . Borry Boyles ' of mare , the one goes home alone . We 'll ride her back and turn her a-loose . " Grandma said , " Ora 'll feel better about him , if he goes with you . I know what happens to Oliver where I can see him , ai n't near as bad as what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bed . He was dizzy . His head felt large and full . He was tempted to sink back on the smooth sheets . Penny said , " Jody 's a man , if I do say it . " He straightened and went to the door . " Must I say good by to Oliver ? " " Why , shore , but do n't let on how bad he looks . He 's proud . " 135THE YEARLINGThey went down the path through the garden . Jody looked back over his shoulder . Grandma stood waving after them . Penny stopped at Boyles ' store for his supplies and for his forequarter of venison . Boyles was willing to lend the mare , if Penny would strap a length of good buckskin for boot laces on the saddle when he sent her home , in payment . The supplies , flour and coffee and powder and lead and shell cases for the new gun , were dropped in a sack . Boyles went to his lot and brought out the mare , saddled with a blanket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " She can outruna wolf , but I would n't want a panther dropping on her . " Penny turned away to lift his sacks . Jody sidled close to the storekeeper . He was reluctant to have his father know Oliver 's secret . He whispered , " I got to see Twink Weatherby . Where do she live ? " " What you want of her ? " " I got somethin ' to say to her . " Boyles said , " A heap of us have something to say to her . Well , you 'll have to bide your time . The young lady 's put a kerchief on her yellow curls and slipped off on the freight boat to Sanford . " Jody felt a satisfaction as great as though he had driven her away himself . He borrowed a piece of paper and a thick pencil and printed a note to Oliver . It was laborious work , for his father 's teachings had been supplemented only by one brief winter of instruction from the itinerant school teacher . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gode up the rivver. im gladd. yor frend jody . He read it over . He decided in favor of a greater kindness . He crossed out " im gladd " and wrote in its place " im sorry . " 136 II 137THE YEARLING He went to Oliver 's room . Oliver 's eyes were swollen shut , as though he had fallen in a nest of wasps . One cheek was purple . A white bandage was tied around his head . His lips were puffed . The fine sailor was laid low , and all because of Twink Weatherby . Jody said , " Good-by , Oliver . " Oliver did not answer . Jody softened . " I 'm sorry Pa and me did n't git there quicker . " Oliver said , " Come here . " Jody went close to the bed . " You do somethin ' for me ? Go tell Twink I 'll meet her at the old grove Tuesday about dusk-dark . " Jody was frozen . He burst out , " I wo n't do it . I hate her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I 'll send Easy . " Jody scuffled the rug with one foot . Oliver said , " I thought you were my friend . " Being friends , he thought , was a nuisance . Then he remem- bered the hunting knife and was filled with gratitude and shame . " Well , all right . I do n't want to , but I 'll tell her . " Oliver laughed from the bed . He would laugh , Jody thought , if he lay dying . " Good-by , Oliver . " " Good-by , Jody . " He left the room . Grandma was waiting . He said , " It come out kind o ' disappointin ' , did n't it , Grand- ma ? Oliver fightin ' , and all . " Penny said , " Boy , be civil . " Grandma said , " The truth 's civil enough . When bears with sore heads go courtin ' , there 's always trouble . As long as this is the end and not the beginning " Penny said , " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtuous . Something of the old glow for Oliver came back to him . Perhaps he could still hear his tales . Crossing to the scrub side on the ferry , he stared down into the swift river . His thoughts were as turbulent as the current . Oliver had never failed him before . The Forresters were after all as rough as his mother insisted . He felt deserted . But he was sure Fodder-wing would not change . The gentle mind in the twisted body would be as aloof from the quarrel as his own . His father , of course , stood as unchangeable as the earth.  --  14  --  THE quail were nesting . The fluted covey call had been silentfor some time . The coveys were dividing into pairs . The cocks were sounding the mating call , clear and sweet and insistent . One day in mid-June Jody saw a cock and a hen run from the grape arbor with the scuttling hurry of paternity . He was wise enough not to follow them , but prowled about under the arbor until he found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful not to touch them , for fear the quail might desert them , as guineas did . A week later he went to the arbor to look at the progress of the Scuppernongs . They were like the smallest pellets of shot , but they were green and sturdy . He lifted a length of vine , imagining the dusty golden grapes in the late summer. 139THE YEARLING I THE YEARLINGThere was a stirring at his feet , as though the grass had exploded . The setting was hatched . The young quail , each no bigger than the end of his thumb , scattered like small windblownleaves . The mother quail cried out , and made alternate sorties after the brood , in defense , and at Jody , in attack . He stood quiet , as his father had taught him to do . The hen gatheredher young together and took them away through the tall broom-sage grasses . Jody ran to find his father . Penny was working the field peas . " Pa , the quail has hatched under the Scuppernong . And the grapes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was wet with sweat . He looked across the field . A hawk flew low , quartering . He said , " If the hawks do n't git the quail , and the ' coons do n't git the Scuppernongs , we 'll have a mighty good meal , about first frost . " Jody said , " I hate the hawks eatin ' the quail , but I do n't someway mind the ' coons eatin ' the grapes . " " That 's because you love quail-meat more'n you love grapes . " " No , ' tai n't . Hit 's because I hate hawks and I love ' coons . " " Fodder-wing learned you that , " Penny said , " with all thempet ' coons . " " I reckon so . " " The hogs come up yit , boy ? " " Not yit .

" Then go tell your Ma please Ma'am to fix us early supper . " Jody went to the house . His mother was rocking and sewing on the shady porch . A small blue-bellied lizard scuttled from under her chair . Jody grinned , thinking how quickly she would heave her frame from the rocker if she had known . " Please , Ma'am , Pa says to fix us supper right now . We got to go huntin ' the hogs . " " About time . " She finished her seam leisurely . He dropped on the step belowher . " We likely got to face the Forresters , Ma , if they got ' em trapped . " " Well , face ' em . Black-hearted thieves . " He stared at her . She had been furious at both him and hisfather because they had fought the Forresters at Volusia . He said , " We 're like to git beat up and bloodied agin , Ma . " She folded her sewing impatiently . " Well , pity on us , we got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ? " She went into the house . He heard her thumping the lid on the Dutch oven . He was confused . His mother talked much141THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGof " duty . " He had always hated the very word . Why was it his duty to let the Forresters maul him again , to recover the hogs , if it had not been his duty to let them maul him in order to help his friend Oliver ? It seemed more honorable to him to bleed for a friend than for a side of bacon . He sat idly , listening to the fluttered whirring of mocking-birds in the chinaberry . The jays were chasing the red-birds out of the mulberry trees . There was a squabble for food even in the safety of the clearing . But it seemed to him there was always enough here for every one . There was food and shelter for father and mother and son ; for old Cxsar ; for Trixie and her spotted calf ; for Rip and Julia ; for the chickens , clucking and crowingand scratching ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cob of corn ; for the song-birds in the trees , and the quail nesting under the arbor ; for all of these , there was enough at the clearing . Out in the scrub , the war waged ceaselessly . The bears and wolves and panthers and wild-cats all preyed on the deer . Bears even ate the cubs of other bears , all meat being to their maws the same . Squirrels and wood-rats , ' possums and ' coons , must all scurry for their lives . Birds and small furred creatures coweredin the shadow of hawk and owl . But the clearing was safe . Penny kept it so , with his good fences , with Rip and old Julia , with a wariness that seemed to Jody to be unsleeping . Sometimes he heard a rustling in the night , and the door opened and closed , and it was Penny , slipping back to his bed from a silent hunt for some marauder . There was intrusion back and forth , as well . The Baxters went into the scrub for flesh of deer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry varmints came into the clearing when they could . The clearing was ringed around with hunger . It was a fortress in the scrub . Baxter 's Island was an island of plenty in a hungry sea . He heard the trace chains clanking . Penny was returning tothe lot along the fence row . Jody ran ahead to open the lot gates for him . He helped with the unharnessing . He climbed the ladder into the loft and pitched down a forkful of cowpea hay into Cxsar 's manger . There was no more corn and would not be until the summer 's crop was made . He found a pile of hay with the dried peas still clinging to it and threw it down for Trixie . There would be more milk in the morning for both the Baxters and the spotted calf . The calf was inclined to leanness , for Penny was weaning it from the cow . The loft was heavy with heat , trapped under the thick hand-hewn slabs of the shingled roof . The hay crackled with a dry sweetness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , abandoning himself to the resiliency . He was no more than comfortable when he heard his mother call . He scrambled down from the loft . Penny had finished milking . They went to the house together . Supper was on the table . There were only clabber and cornbread , but there was enough . Ma Baxter said , " You fellers try to git a shot at some meat while you 're off . " Penny nodded . " I 'm totin ' my gun o ' purpose . " They set off to the west . The sun was still above the treetops . There had been no rain for several days , but now cumulusclouds were piled low in the north and west . From the east and south , a steel grayness crept toward the glaring brilliance of the west . Penny said , " A good rain today 'd near about leave us lay by the corn . " There was no breeze . The air lay over the road like a thick down comforter . It seemed to Jody that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle up through it . The sand burned his bare calloused soles . Rip and Julia walked listlessly , heads down , tails sagging , their tongues dripping from open jaws . It was not easy to follow the tracks of the hogsTHE YEARLINGwhere the loose soil had been so long dry . Penny 's eye was keener here than Julia 's nose . The hogs had fed through the black-jack , crossed the abandoned clearing , and then headed for the prairie , where lily roots could be dug , and pools of cool water could be muddied and wallowed in . They did not range so far when food could be had close at home . Now was a barrenand parlous season . There was no mast yet , of pine or oak or hickory , except what could be rooted deep under the leaves from last year 's falling . Palmetto berries were still too green , even for the undiscerning taste of a hog . Three miles from Baxter'sIsland Penny crouched to examine the trail . He picked up a grain of corn and turned it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse . " They baited them hogs , " he said . He straightened his back . His face was grave . Jody watched him anxiously . " Well , son , we 're obliged to follow . " " Clare to the Forresters ? " " Clare to wheresomever the hogs be . Mought be , we 'll find ' em in a pen some'eres . " The trail zigzagged where the hogs had weaved back and forth for the scattered corn . Penny said , " I kin understand the Forresters fightin ' Oliver and I kin understand them rompin ' on you and me . But I be dogged if I kin understand cold-out meanness . " A quarter of a mile beyond stood a rough hog-trap . It had been sprung but the pen was now empty . It was made of untrimmedsaplings and a limber sapling had been baited to spring the gate behind the crowding hogs . " Them rascals was nearby , waitin ' , " Penny said . " That pen would n't hold a hog no time . " A cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pen . The wheel tracks led down a dim scrub road toward Forresters ' Island. 144THE YEARLINGPenny said , " All right , boy . Here 's our way . " The sun was near the horizon . The cumulus clouds were white puff-balls , stained with the red and yellow wash of the sunset . The south was filled with darkness , like the smoke of gunpowder . A chill air moved across the scrub and was gone , as though a vast being had blown a cold breath and then passed by . Jody shivered and was grateful for the hot air that fell in behind it . A wild grape-vine trailed across the thin-rutted road . Penny leaned to pull it aside . He said , " When there 's trouble waitin ' for you , you jest as good go to meet it . " The rattler struck him from under the grape-vine without warning . Jody saw the flash , blurred as a shadow , swifter than a martin , surer than the slashing claws of a bear . He saw his father stagger backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a cry . He wanted to step back , too . He wanted to cry out with all his voice . He stood rooted to the sand and could not make a sound . It was lightning that had struck , and not a rattler . It was a branch that broke , it was a bird that flew , it was a rabbit runningPenny shouted , " Git back ! Hold the dogs ! " The voice released him . He dropped back and clutched the dogs by the scruff of their necks . He saw the mottled shadow lift its flat head , knee-high . The head swung from side to side , following his father 's slow motions . He heard the rattles hum . The dogs heard . They winded . The fur stood stiff on their bodies . Old Julia whined and twisted out of his hand . She turned and slunk down the trail . Her long tail clung to her hindquarters . Rip reared on his hind feet , barking . As slowly as a man in a dream , Penny backed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely it was a locust humming . Surely it was a tree-frog singing  --  Penny lifted his gun to his shoulder and fired . Jody quivered . The rattler coiled and writhed in its spasms . The head was buried in the145THE YEARLINGsand . The contortions moved down the length of the thick body , the rattles whirred feebly and were still . The coiling flattenedinto slow convolutions , like a low tide ebbing . Penny turned and stared at his son . He said , " He got me . " He lifted his right arm and gaped at it . His lips lifted dry over his teeth . His throat worked . He looked dully at two puncturesin the flesh . A drop of blood oozed from each . He said , " He was a big un . " Jody let go his hold on Rip . The dog ran to the dead snake and barked fiercely . He made sorties and at last poked the coils with one paw . He quieted and snuffed about in the sand . Penny lifted his head from his staring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 01 ' Death goin ' to git me yit . " He licked his lips . He turned abruptly and began to push through the scrub in the direction of the clearing . The road would be shorter going , for it was open , but he headed blindly for home in a direct line . He plowed through the low scrub oaks , the gallberries , the scrub palmettos . Jody panted behind him . His heart pounded so hard that he could not see where he was going . He followed the sound of his father 's crashing across the undergrowth . Suddenly the denseness ended . A patch of higher oaks made a shaded clearing . It was strange to walk in silence . Penny stopped short . There was a stirring ahead . A doe-deer leaped to her feet . Penny drew a deep breath , as though breathingwere for some reason easier . He lifted his shotgun and leveled it at the head . It flashed over Jody 's mind that his father had gone mad . This was no moment to stop for game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to the sand and kicked a little and lay still . Penny ran to the body and drew his knife from its scabbard . Now Jody knew his father was insane . Penny did not cut the throat , but slashed into the belly . He laid the carcass wide open . The pulse still throbbed146THE YEARLINGin the heart . Penny slashed out the liver . Kneeling , he changed his knife to his left hand . He turned his right arm and stared again at the twin punctures . They were now closed . The forearmwas thick-swollen and blackening . The sweat stood out on his forehead . He cut quickly across the wound . A dark blood gushed and he pressed the warm liver against the incision . He said in a hushed voice , " I kin feel it draw " He pressed harder . He took the meat away and looked at it . It was a venomous green . He turned it and applied the fresh side . He said , " Cut me out a piece o ' the heart . " Jody jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hacked away a portion . Penny said , " Another . " He changed the application again and again .

" " I 'd ruther bleed to death than swell . I seed a man die  --  " The sweat poured down his cheeks . " Do it hurt bad , Pa ? " ' Like a hot knife was buried to the shoulder . " The meat no longer showed green when he withdrew it . The warm vitality of the doe 's flesh was solidifying in death . He stood up . He said quietly , " I cai n't do it no more good . I 'm goin ' on home . You go to the Forresters and git ' em to ride to the Branch for Doc Wilson . " " Reckon they 'll go ? " " We got to chance it . Call out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethin ' at you or mebbe shoot . " He turned back to pick up the beaten trail . Jody followed . Over his shoulder he heard a light rustling . He looked back . A147THE YEARLINGspotted fawn stood peering from the edge of the clearing , wavering on uncertain legs . Its dark eyes were wide and wondering . He called out , " Pa ! The doe 's got a fawn . " " Sorry , boy . I cai n't he'p it . Come on . " An agony for the fawn came over him . He hesitated . It tossed its small head , bewildered . It wobbled to the carcass of the doe and leaned to smell it . It bleated . Penny called , " Git a move on , young un . " Jody ran to catch up with him . Penny stopped an instant at the dim road . " Tell somebody to take this road in to our place and pick me up in case I cai n't make it in . Hurry . " The horror of his father 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He began to run . His father was plodding with a slow desperation in the direction of Baxter 's Island . Jody ran down the wagon trail to the myrtle thicket where it branched off into the main road to Forresters ' Island . The road , much used , had no growth of weeds or grass to make a footing . The dry shifting sand caught at the soles of his feet and seemed to wrap clinging tentacles around the muscles of his legs . He dropped into a short dog-trot that seemed to pull more steadily against the sand . His legs moved , but his mind and body seemed suspended above them , like an empty box on a pair of cart-wheels . The road under him was a treadmill . His legs pumped up and down , but he seemed to be passing the same trees and bushes again and again . His pace seemed so slow , so futile , that he came to a bend with a dull surprise . The curve was familiar . He was not far from the road that led directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees of the island . They startled him , because they meant that he was now so close . He came alive and he was afraid . He was afraid of the Forresters . And if they refused him help , and he got safely away again , where should148THE YEARLINGhe go ? He halted a moment under the shadowy live oaks , planning . It was twilight . He was sure it was not time for darkness . The rain clouds were not clouds , but an infusion of the sky , and had now filled it entirely . The only light was a strand of green across the west , the color of the doe 's flesh with the venom on it . It came to him that he would call to his friend Fodder-wing . His friend would hear him and come , and he might be allowed to approach close enough to tell his errand . It eased his heart to think of it , to think of his friend 's eyes gentle with sorrow for him . He drew a long breath and ran wildly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fodder-wing ! Fodder-wing ! Hit 's Jody ! " In an instant now his friend would come to him from the house , crawling down the rickety steps on all fours , as he must do when in a hurry . Or he would appear from the bushes with his raccoon at his heels . " Fodder-wing ! Hit 's me ! " There was no answer . He broke into the swept sandy yard . " Fodder-wing ! " There was an early light lit in the house . A twist of smoke curled from the chimney . The doors and shutters were closed against the mosquitoes and against the night-time . The door swung open . In the light beyond , he saw the Forrester men rise to their feet , one after the other , as though the great trees in the forest lifted themselves by their roots and stirred toward him . He stopped short . Lem Forrester advanced to the stoop . He lowered his head and turned it a little sideways until he recognized the intruder . " You leetle varmint . What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's ailin ' . You cai n't see him no-ways . " It was too much . He burst out crying . He sobbed , " Pa  --  He 's snake-bit . " The Forresters came down the steps and surrounded him. 149THE YEARLINGHe sobbed loudly , with pity for himself and for his father , and because he was here at last and something was finished that he had set out to do . There was a stirring among the men , as though the leavening quickened in a bowl of bread-dough . " Where 's he at ? What kind o ' snake ? " " A rattlesnake . A big un . He 's makin ' it for home but he do n't know kin he make it . " " Is he swellin ' ? Where 'd it git him ? " " In the arm . Hit 's bad swelled a'ready . Please ride for Doc Wilson . Please ride for him quick , and I wo n't he'p Oliver agin you no more . Please . " Lem Forrester laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Buck said , " Hit 's like not to do no good . A man dies right now , bit in the arm . He 'll likely be dead afore Doc kin git to him . " " He shot a doe-deer and used the liver to draw out the pizen . Please ride for Doc . " Mill-wheel said , " I 'll ride for him . " Relief flooded him like the sun . " I shore thank you . " " I 'd he'p a dog , was snake-bit . Spare your thanks . " Buck said , " I 'll ride on and pick up Penny . Walkin 's bad for a man is snake-bit . My God , fellers , we ai n't got a drop o ' whiskey for him . " Gabby said , " 01 ' Doc 'll have some . If he 's purty tol'able sober , he 'll have some left . If he 's drunk all he 's got , he kin blow his breath , and that 'll make a powerful portion . " Buck and Mill-wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their horses . Their leisureliness frightened Jody as speed would not have done . If there was hope for his father , they would be hurrying . They were as slow and unconcernedas though they were burying Penny , not riding for assistance . He stood , desolate . He would like to see Fodder-15oTHE YEARLINGwing just a moment before he went away . The remaining Forrestersturned back up the steps , ignoring him . Lem called from the door , " Git goin ' , Skeeter . " Arch said , " Leave the young un be . Do n't torment him , and his daddy likely dyin ' . " Lem said , " Die and good riddance . Biggety bantam . " They went into the house and closed the door . A panic came over Jody , that they did not mean , any of them , to help at all ; that Buck and Mill-wheel had gone away to the corral for a joke , and were laughing at him there . He was forsaken , and his father was forsaken . Then the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unkindly . " No use to fret , boy . We 'll do what we kin . We do n't hold nothin ' agin folks in trouble . " They touched their heels to the horses ' flanks and shot away . Lightness filled him where he had been heavy as lead . It was only Lem , then , who was an enemy . He settled his hate on him with satisfaction . He listened until the hoof-beats faded from his hearing , then set out down the road for home . Now he was free to accept the facts . A rattlesnake had struck his father , who might die of it . But help was on the way , and he had done what he was supposed to do . His fear had a name , and was no longer quite so terrible . He decided not to try to run , but to walk steadily . He should have liked to ask the loan of a horse for himself , but dared not . A pattering of rain passed over him . A hush followed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often happened . There was a faint luminosity in the air around him . He had scarcely been conscious that he was carrying his father 's gun . He swung it over one shoulder and walked rapidly where the road was firm . He wondered how long it would take Millwheelto reach the Branch . He wondered , not whether old Doc would be drunk , for that was known , but just how drunk he would be . If Doc could sit up in bed , he was considered fit to go. 151THE YEARLINGHe had been at Doc 's place once when he was very young . He remembered still the sprawling house with wide verandas , decaying , as old Doc was decaying , in the heart of a dense vegetation . He remembered the cockroaches and the lizards , as much at home inside the house as in the thick vines outside it . He remembered old Doc , deep in his cups , lying under a mosquitocanopy , staring at the ceiling . When he was called , he sprawled to his feet and went about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . He was known far and wide as a good doctor , drunk or no . If he could be reached in time , Jody thought , his father 's life was certain . He turned from the Forresters ' lane into the road that ran east to his father 's clearing . He had four miles ahead of him . On hard ground , he could make it in little over an hour . The sand was soft , and the very darkness seemed to hold him back and make his steps uneven . He would do well to reach home in an hour and a half , and it might take two . He broke now and then into a trot . The brightness in the air dropped into the darkness of the scrub like a water turkey dropping into the river . The growth on either side of the road pressed closer , so that the way was narrow . He heard thunder in the east , and a flash of lightning filled the sky . He thought he heard foot-steps in the scrub oaks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves . He had never minded night or darkness , but Penny had always been in front of him . Now he was alone . He wondered , sickened , whether his father lay now in the road ahead of him , swollen with poison , or perhaps across Buck 's saddle , if Buck had reached and found him . The lightning flashed again . He had sat with his father through many storms , under the live oaks . The rain had then been friendly , shutting them in together . A snarl sounded in the bushes . Something incredibly swift flashed across the road in front of him and was gone , soundlessly . A musky taint lay on the air . He was not afraid of lynx152THE YEARLINGor wild-cat , but a panther had been known to attack a horse . His heart thumped . He fingered the stock of his father 's gun . It was useless , for Penny had shot both barrels , one at the rattler , one at the doe . He had his father 's knife in his belt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him . He had no scabbard for it , and it was dangerously sharp , Penny had said , to carry . When he was safe at home , lying under the grape arbor , or at the bottom of the sink-hole , he had pictured himself thrusting it with one sure plunge into the heart of bear or wolf or panther . There was no flush of pride now in the picture . A panther 's claws were quicker than he . Whatever the animal , it had gone its way . He walked more rapidly , stumbling in his haste . He thought he heard a wolf howl , but it was so far away that it might only have been the wind . The wind was rising . He heard it far off in the distance . It was as though it were blowing in another world , across a dark abyss . Suddenly it swelled . He heard it coming closer , like a moving wall . The trees ahead thrashed their limbs . The bushes rattled and flattened to the ground . There was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lowered his head and fought against it . He was drenched to the skin in an instant . The rain poured down the back of his neck and washed through his breeches . His clothes hung heavily and held him back . He stopped and turned his back to the wind and propped the gun at the side of the road . He took off his shirt and breeches and rolled them into a bundle . He took up the gun and went on naked through the storm . The rain on his bare skin made him feel clean and free . The lightningflashed and he was startled by his own whiteness . He felt suddenly defenceless . He was alone and naked in an unfriendly world ; lost and forgotten in the storm and darkness . Somethingran behind him and ahead of him . It stalked the scrub like a panther . It was vast and formless and it was his enemy . 01 ' Death was loose in the scrub. 153THE YEARLING It came to him that his father was already dead , or dying The burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake it off . Penny could not die . Dogs could die , and bear and deer and other people . That was acceptable , because it wa remote . His father could not die . The earth might cave in un der him in one vast sink-hole and he could accept it . But with out Penny , there was no earth . Without him there was nothing He was frightened as he had never been before . He began t sob . His tears ran salt into his mouth . He begged of the night , as he had begged of the Forresters " Please " His throat ached and his groins were shot with hot lead . Th lightning showed an opening ahead of him . He had reache the abandoned clearing . He darted into it and crouched agains the old rail fence for a moment 's shelter . The wind washe over him more coldly than the rain . He shivered and rose an went on again . The stop had chilled him . He wanted to run to warm himself , but he had strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand so that the walking was firm and easier . The wind lessened . The down-pour settled into a stead falling . He walked on in a dull misery . It seemed to him tha he must walk forever , but suddenly he was passing the sink hole and was at the clearing . The Baxter cabin was bright with candles . Horses whinnied and pawed the sand . There were three tethered to the slat fence He passed through the gate and into the cabin . Whatever was was done . There was no bustle to greet him . Buck and Mill wheel sat by the empty hearth , tilted back in their chairs . They were talking casually . They glanced at him , said " Hey , boy , " and went on with their talk . " You was n't here , Buck , when of man Twistle died o ' snake bite . Penny must o ' been right about whiskey not doin ' no good . Twistle were drunk as a coot when he stepped on the rattler . " THE YEARLING " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for luck . I 'd ruther die drunk than sober , ary day . " Mill-wheel spat into the fireplace . " Do n't fret , " he said . " You will . " Jody was faint . He dared not ask them the question . He walked past them and into his father 's bedroom . His mother sat on one side of the bed and Doc Wilson sat on the other . Old Doc did not turn his head . His mother looked at him and rose without speaking . She went to a dresser and took out a fresh shirt and breeches and held them out to him . He dropped his wet bundle and stood the gun against the wall . He walked slowly to the bed . He thought , " If he 's not dead now , he 'll not die . " In the bed , Penny stirred . Jody 's heart leaped like a rabbit jumping . Penny groaned and retched . Doc leaned quickly and held a basin for him and propped his head . Penny 's face was dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to emit , but must vomit still . He fell back panting . Doc reached inside the covers and drew out a brick wrapped in flannel . He handed it to Ma Baxter . She laid Jody 's garmentsat the foot of the bed and went to the kitchen to heat the brick again . Jody whispered , " Is he bad ? " " He 's bad , a'right . Looks as if he 'd make it . Then again , looks as if he wo n't . " Penny opened his puffed eyes . The pupils were dilated until his eyes seemed black . He moved his arm . It was swollen as thick as a bullock 's thigh . He murmured thickly , " You 'll ketch cold . " Jody fumbled for his clothes and pulled them on . Doc nodded . " That 's a good sign , knowin ' you . That 's the first he 's spoken . " A tenderness filled Jody that was half pain , half sweetness . THE YEARLINGIn his agony , his father was concerned for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " He 's obliged to make it , Doc , sir . " He added , as he had heard his father say , " Us Baxters is all runty and tough . " Doc nodded . He called to the kitchen , " Let 's try some warm milk now . " With hope , Ma Baxter began to sniffle . Jody joined her at the hearth . She whimpered , " I do n't see as we 'd deserve it , do it happen . " He said , " Hit 'll not happen , Ma . " But his marrow was cold again . He went outside for wood to hurry the fire . The storm was moving on to the west . The clouds were rolling like battalionsof marching Spaniards . In the east , bright spaces showed , filled with stars . The wind blew fresh and cool . He came in with an armful of fatwood . He said , " Hit 'll be a purty day tomorrow , Ma . " " Hit 'll be a purty day iffen he 's yit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They dropped on the hearth and hissed . She lifted her apron and wiped her eyes . " You take the milk in , " she said . " I 'll make Doc and me a cup o ' tea . I had n't et nothin ' , waitin ' for you-all , when Buck carried him in . " He remembered that he had eaten lightly . He could think of nothing that would taste good . The thought of food on his tongue was a dry thought , without nourishment or relish . He carried the cup of hot milk carefully , balancing it in his hands . Doc took it from him and sat close to Penny on the bed . " Now boy , you hold his head up while I spoon-feed him . " Penny 's head was heavy on the pillow . Jody 's arms ached with the strain of lifting it . His father 's breathing was heavy , like the Forresters when they were drunk . His face had changed color . It was green and pallid , like a frog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 156THE YEARLINGDoc said , " Open your mouth before I call the Forresters to open it . " The swollen lips parted . Penny swallowed . A portion of the cupful went down . He turned his head away . Doc said , " All right . But if you lose it , I 'm comin ' back with more . " Penny broke into a sweat . Doc said , " That 's fine . Sweatin 's fine , for poison . Lord of thejay-birds , if we were n't all out of whiskey , I 'd make you sweat . " Ma Baxter came to the bedroom with two plates with cupsof tea and biscuits on them . Doc took his plate and balanced it on his knee . He drank with a mixture of gusto and distaste . He said , " It 's all right , but ' tai n't whiskey . " He was the soberest Jody had ever heard of his being . " A good man snake-bit , " he said mournfully , " and the whole county out of whiskey . " Ma Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I ai n't hongry . " His stomach was as queasy as his father 's . It seemed to him that he could feel the poison working in his own veins , attackinghis heart , churning in his gizzard . Doc said , " Blest if he ai n't goin ' to keep that milk down . " Penny was in a deep sleep . Ma Baxter rocked and sipped and nibbled . She said , " The Lord watches the sparrer 's fall . Mought be He 'll take a hand for the Baxters . " Jody went into the front room . Buck and Mill-wheel had lain down on the deer-skin rugs on the floor . Jody said , " Ma and Doc 's eatin ' . You-all hongry ? " Buck said , " We 'd jest done et when you come . Do n't pay us no mind . We 'll sleep here and wait-see how it comes out . " Jody crouched on his heels . He would have liked to talk with them . It would be good to talk of dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living men could do . Buck snored . Jody tiptoed back to the bedroom . Doc was nodding in his chair . His mother moved the candle from the bed-side and returned to her rocker . The runners swished a while and then were still . She too nodded . It seemed to Jody that he was alone with his father . The vigil was in his hands . If he kept awake , and labored for breath with the tortured sleeper , breathing with him and for him , he could keep him alive . He drew a breath as deep as the ones his father was drawing . It made him dizzy . He was light-headed and his stomach was empty . He knew he would feel better if he should eat , but he could not swallow . He sat down on the floor and leaned his head against the side of the bed . He began to think back over the day , as though he walked a road backward . He could not help but feel a greater security here beside his father , than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be terrible alone that were not terrible when he was with Penny . Only the rattlesnake had kept all its horror . He recalled the triangular head , the lightning flash of its striking , the subsidence into alert coils . His flesh crawled . It seemed to him he should never be easy in the woods again . He recalled the coolness of his father 's shot , and the fear of the dogs . He recalled the doe and the horror of her warm meat against his father 's wound . He remembered the fawn . He sat upright . The fawn was alone in the night , as he had been alone . The catastrophe that might take his father , had made it motherless . It had lain hungry and bewildered through the thunder and rain and lightning , close to the devastated body of its dam , waiting for the stiff form to arise and give it warmth and food and comfort . He pressed his face into the hanging covers of the bed and cried bitterly . He was torn with hate for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JoDY moved through a tortuous dream . With his father beside him , he fought a nest of rattlesnakes . They crawled across his feet , trailing their rattles , clacking lightly . The nest resolveditself into one snake , gigantic , moving toward him on a level with his face . It struck and he tried to scream but could not . He looked for his father . He lay under the rattler , with his eyes open to a dark sky . His body was swollen to the size of a bear . He was dead . Jody began to move backward away from the rattler , one agonized step at a time . His feet were glued to the ground . The snake suddenly vanished and he stood alone in a vast windy place , holding the fawn in his arms . Penny was gone . A sense of sorrow filled him so that he thought his heart would break . He awakened , sobbing . He sat up on the hard floor . Day was breaking over the clear-15911 , k t , ' % ' : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : : ; THE YEARLINGing . A pale light lay in streaks beyond the pine trees . The room was filled with grayness . For an instant he was still conscious of the fawn against him . Then he remembered . He scrambled to his feet and looked at his father . Penny was breathing with a greater ease . He was still swollenand fevered , but he looked no worse than when the wild honey bees had stung him . Ma Baxter was asleep in her rocker with her head thrown far back . Old Doc lay across the foot of the bed . Jody whispered , " Doc ! " Doc grunted and lifted his head . " What is it  --  what is it  --  what is it ? " " Doc ! Look at Pa ! " Doc shifted his body and eased himself on one elbow . He blinked and rubbed his eyes . He sat up . He leaned over Penny . " Lord o ' the jay-birds , he 's made it . " Ma Baxter said , " Eh ? " She sat upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sight . " She burst out crying . Doc said , " You sound like you 're sorry . " She said , " You jest do n't know what ' t would mean , him leavin ' us here . " Jody had never heard her speak so gently . Doc said , " Why , you got you another man here . Look atJody , now . Big enough to plow and reap and do the huntin ' . " She said , " Jody 's a'right , but he ai n't a thing but boy . Gothis mind on nothin ' but prowlin ' and playin ' . " He hung his head . It was true . She said , " His Pa encourages him . " Doc said , " Well , boy , be glad you got encouragement . Most of us live our lives without it . Now , Ma'am , let 's get some more milk down this feller , time he wakes . " 16oTHE YEARLINGJody said eagerly , " I 'll go milk , Ma . " She said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front room . Buck was sitting up on the floor , rubbing his head sleepily . Mill-wheel was still asleep . Jody said , " Doc says Pa 's done made it . " " I be dogged . I woked up , fixin ' to go he'p bury him . " Jody went around the side of the house and took down the milk-gourd from the wall . He felt as light as the gourd . It seemed to him in his liberation that he might spread his arms and float over the gate like a feather . The dawn was still nebulous . A mocking-bird made a thin metallic sound in the chinaberry . The Dominick rooster crowed uncertainly . This was the hour at which Penny arose , allowing Jody to sleep a little later . The morning was still , with a faint fluttering of breeze through the tops of the tall pine trees . The sunrise reached long fingers into the clearing . As he clicked the lotgate , doves flew from the pines with a whistling of wings . He called exultantly after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing him . He climbed into the loft for fodderfor her . She was very patient , he thought , giving her milk in return for so poor a feeding . She munched hungrily . She lifted a hind leg once in threat when he was clumsy with the milking . He stripped two teats carefully , then turned the calf in with her to nurse on the other two . There was not as much milk as his father would have gotten from her . He decided that he would drink none himself so that his father might have all of it until he was well again . The calf butted the sagging udders and sucked noisily . It was too big still to be nursing . The thought of the fawn returned to him . A leaden feeling came over him again . It would be desperate with hunger this morning . He wondered if it would try to nurse the cold teats of the doe . The open flesh of the dead deer would attract the wolves . Perhaps they had found the fawn and had torn its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE YEARLINGmorning , in his father 's living , was darkened and tainted . His mind followed the fawn and would not be comforted . His mother took the milk-gourd without comment on the quantity . She strained the milk and poured a cupful and took it to the sick room . He followed her . Penny was awake . He smiled weakly . He whispered thickly , " 01 ' Death got to wait a while on me . " Doc said , " You belong to be kin to the rattlesnakes , man . How you done it without whiskey , I do n't know . " Penny whispered , " Why , Doc , I 'm a king snake . You know a rattler cai n't kill a king snake . " Buck and Mill-wheel came into the room . They grinned . Buck said , " You ai n't purty , Penny , but by God , you 're alive . " Doc held the milk to Penny 's lips . He swallowed thirstily . Doc said , " I ca n't take much credit for savin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a die of it . " Penny closed his eyes . He said , " I could sleep a week . " Doc said , " That 's what I want you to do . I ca n't do no more for you . " He stood up and stretched his legs . Ma Baxter said , " Who 'll do the farmin ' and him asleep ? " Buck said , " What 's he got , belongs to be done ? " " Mostly the corn , needs another workin ' to be laid by . The ' taters needs hoein ' , but Jody 's right good at hoein ' , do he choose to stick to it . " " I 'll stick , Ma . " Buck said , " I 'll stay and beholden to you . " " Hell , Ma'am , they ai n't too many of us shiftin ' for a livin ' out here . I 'd be a pore man , did n't I not stay .

I 'd be proud to eat breakfast before I go . " She bustled to the kitchen . Jody went to build up the fire . She said , " I never figgered I 'd be beholden to a Forrester . " " Buck ai n't exactly a Forrester , Ma . Buck 's a friend . " " Hit do look that-a-way . " She filled the coffee-pot with water and added fresh coffee to the grounds . She said , " Go to the smoke-house and git that last side o ' bacon . I 'll not be out-done . " He brought it proudly . She allowed him to slice the meat . He said , " Ma , Pa shot a doe and used the liver to draw outthe pizen . He bled hisself and then laid on the liver . " " You should of carried back a haunch o ' the meat . " " There was n't no time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , too . " " Ma , the doe had a fawn . " " Well , most does has fawns . " " This un was right young . Nigh about new-borned .

The fat was sizzling in the skillet . She poured in the batter . The bacon crackled in the pan . She turned and flattened the slices , so that they would brown evenly . He wondered if they would ever be able to fill up Buck and Mill-wheel , accustomed to the copiousness of Forrester victuals . He said , " Make a heap o ' gravy , Ma . " " Iffen you 'll do without your milk , I 'll make milk-gravy . " The sacrifice was nothing . He said , " We could of kilt a chicken . " " I studied on it , but they 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornpone . The coffee began to boil. 163THE YEARLINGHe said , " I could of shot some doves or some squirrels this mornin ' . " " A fine time to think of it . Go tell the men-folks to wash theirselves and come to table . " He called them . The three men went outside to the watershelfand slapped water over their faces , dabbled their hands . He brought them a clean towel . Doc said , " Blest if I do n't get hungry when I 'm sober . " Mill-wheel said , " Whiskey 's a food . I could live on whiskey . " Doc said , " I 've near about done it . Twenty years . Since mywife died . " Jody was proud of the table . There were not as many differentdishes as the Forresters served , but there was enough of everything . The men ate greedily . At last they pushed away their plates and lit their pipes . Mill-wheel said , " Seems like Sunday , do n't it ? " Ma Baxter said , " Sickness always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , and the men not goin ' to the field . " Jody had never seen her so amiable . She had waited to eat until the men were done , for fear of their not having plenty . She sat now eating with relish . The men chatted idly . Jody allowed his thoughts to drift back to the fawn . He could not keep it out of his mind . It stood in the back of it as close as he had held it , in his dreaming , in his arms . He slipped from the table and went to his father 's bedside . Penny lay at rest . His eyes were open and clear , but the pupils were still dark and dilated . Jody said , " How you comin ' , Pa ? " " Jest fine , son . 01 ' Death gone thievin ' elsewhere . But wa' n't it a close squeak ! " " I mean . " Penny said , " I 'm proud of you , boy , the way you kept your head and done what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , son .

Hit 'll soon git to where it kin make out on leaves and acorns . " " Dogged if you do n't figger the farrest of ary young un I 've ever knowed .

I never figgered I 'd see daylight , come dawn today . " " Kin I ride back with Mill-wheel and see kin I find it ? " " Tell your Ma I said you 're to go . " He sidled back to the table and sat down . His mother was pouring coffee for every one . He said , " Ma , Pa says I kin go bring back the fawn . " She held the coffee-pot in mid-air . " What fawn ? " " The fawn belonged to the doe we kilt , to use the liver to draw out the pizen and save Pa . " She gasped . " Well , for pity sake " Pa says hit 'd not be grateful , to leave it starve . " Doc Wilson said , " That 's right , Ma'am . Nothing in the165THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGworld do n't ever come quite free . The boy 's right and his daddy 's right .

" " Reckon you 'd not git home a-tall , " she said , " if ' twas n't for dinner-time . " Doc said , " That 's man-nature , Ma'am .

Every trip I make , I 'll think , Thank you , Jody Baxter . " He was proud with old Doc 's pleasure . They went outside to water the horses and feed them from the scanty stock of hay in the Baxter barn . Buck said to Jody , " You Baxters is makin ' out and that 's about all , ai n't it ? " Doc said , " Baxter 's had to carry the work alone . Time the boy here gets some size to him , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to mean much to a Baxter . " Mill-wheel mounted his horse and pulled Jody up behind him . Doc mounted and turned away in the opposite direction . Jody waved after him . His heart was light . He said to Mill-wheel , " You reckon the fawn 's yit there ? Will you he'p me find him ? " " We 'll find him , do he be alive . How you know it 's a he ? " " The spots was all in a line . On a doe-fawn , Pa says the spots is ever ' which-a-way . " " That 's the female of it . " " What you mean ? " " Why , females is on-accountable .

He said , " Cut to the north , Mill-wheel . Hit were up herePa got snake-bit and kilt the doe and I seed the fawn . " " What was you and your daddy doin ' up this road ? " Jody hesitated . " We was huntin ' our hogs . " " Oh  --  Huntin ' your hogs , eh ? Well , do n't fret about them hogs . I jest got a idee they 'll be home by sundown .

" " He 's purely ailin ' . He ai n't like the rest of us . He ai n't like nobody . Seems like he drinks air ' stead o ' water , and feeds on what the wild creeturs feeds on , ' stead o ' bacon .

Hit 's gittin ' right thick up this trail . " Suddenly Jody was unwilling to have Mill-wheel with him . If the fawn was dead , or could not be found , he could not have his disappointment seen . And if the fawn was there , the meeting would be so lovely and so secret that he could not endure to share it . He said , " Hit 's not fur now , but hit 's powerful thick for a horse . I kin make it a-foot . " " But I 'm daresome to leave you , boy . Suppose you was to git lost , or snake-bit , too ? " " I 'll take keer .

" " So long , Mill-wheel . I 'm shore obliged . " He waved after him . He waited for the sound of the hooves to end , then cut to the right . The scrub was still . Only his own crackling of twigs sounded across the silence . He was eager almost past caution , but he broke a bough and pushed it ahead of him where the growth was thick and the ground invisible . Rattlers got out of the way when they had a chance . Penny had gone farther into the oak thicket than he remembered . He wondered for an instant if he had mistaken his direction . Then a buzzard rose in front of him and flapped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buzzards sat in a169THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGcircle around the carcass of the doe . They turned their heads on their long scrawny necks and hissed at him . He threw his bough at them and they flew into an adjacent tree . Their wings creaked and whistled like rusty pump-handles . The sand showed large cat-prints , he could not tell whether of wild-cat or of panther . But the big cats killed fresh , and they had left the doe to the carrion birds . He asked himself whether the sweeter meat of the fawn had scented the air for the curled nostrils . He skirted the carcass and parted the grass at the place where he had seen the fawn . It did not seem possible that it was only yesterday . The fawn was not there . He circled the clearing . There was no sound , no sign . The buzzards clacked their wings , impatient to return to their business . He returned to the spot where the fawn had emerged and dropped to all fours , studying the sand for the small hoof-prints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of cat and buzzards . But the cat-sign had not been made in this direction . Under a scrub palmetto he was able to make out a track , pointed and dainty as the mark of a ground-dove . He crawled past the palmetto . Movement directly in front of him startled him so that he tumbled backward . The fawn lifted its face to his . It turned its head with a wide , wondering motion and shook him through with the stare of its liquid eyes . It was quivering . It made no effort to rise or run . Jody could not trust himself to move . He whispered , " It 's me . " The fawn lifted its nose , scenting him . He reached out one hand and laid it on the soft neck . The touch made him delirious . He moved forward on all fours until he was close beside it . He put his arms around its body . A light convulsion passed over it but it did not stir . He stroked its sides as gently as though the fawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its170skin was softer than the white ' coonskin knapsack . It was sleek and clean and had a sweet scent of grass . He rose slowly and lifted the fawn from the ground . It was no heavier than old Julia . Its legs hung limply . They were surprisingly long and he had to hoist the fawn as high as possible under his arm . He was afraid that it might kick and bleat at sight and smell of its mother . He skirted the clearing and pushed his way into the thicket . It was difficult to fight through with his burden . The fawn 's legs caught in the bushes and he could not lift his own with freedom . He tried to shield its face from prickling vines . Its head bobbed with his stride . His heart thumped with the marvel of its acceptance of him . He reached the trail and walked as fast as he could until he came to the intersection with the road home . He stopped to rest and set the fawn down on its dangling legs . It wavered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , enchanted , " I 'll tote you time I git my breath . " He remembered his father 's saying that a fawn would follow that had been first carried .

It was willing to follow him . It belonged to him . It was his own . He was light-headed with his joy . He wanted to fondle it , to run and romp with it , to call to it to come to him . He dared not alarm it . He picked it up and carried it in front of him over his two arms . It seemed to him that he walked without effort . He had the strength of a Forrester .

It was fresh and green after the night 's rain . He could see Buck Forrester following old Caesar at the plow in the cornfield . He thought he heard him curse the horse 's slowness . He fumbled with the gate latch and was finally obliged to set down the fawn to manage it .

It stamped its small hooves impatiently . As long as he held his fingers below the level of the mik , the fawn was content . It closed its eyes dreamily . It was ecstasy to feel its tongue against his hand . Its small tail flicked back and forth . The last of the milk vanished in a swirl of foam and gurgling . The fawn bleated and butted but its frenzy was appeased . Jody was tempted to go for more milk , but even with his father 's backing he was afraid to press his advantage too far .

He went to the live oaks at the north end of the yard and pulled down armfuls of Spanish moss . He made a thick bed in the shed . A hen was on a nest close by . Her bright beady eyes watched him dubiously . She finished her laying and flew through the door , cackling . The nest was a new one , with six eggs in it .

" Now you belong to do whatever I tell you , " he said . " Like 174175THE YEARLINGas if I was your mammy . I tell you to lay here ' til I come git you agin . " The fawn blinked its eyelids . It groaned comfortably and dropped its head . He tiptoed from the shed . No dog , he thought , could be more biddable . He went to the wood-pile and shaved fine splinters of fatwood for kindling . He arranged the pile neatly . He gathered an armful of black-jack oak and took it to his mother 's wood-box in the kitchen . He said , " Was it all right , Ma , the way I skimmed the cream ? " " Hit was all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is ? " " Lem would n't leave me see him . Lem 's the only one is mad at us , Ma . On account of Oliver 's gal . " " Uh-huh . " " Mill-wheel said he 'd leave me know and I could slip in some time and see Fodder-wing when Lem ai n't around . " She laughed . " You 're talkified as a old woman today . " She passed him on her way to the hearth and touched his head lightly . She said , " I feel right good , myself . I never figgered your Pa 'd see daylight today . " The kitchen was filled with peace . There was a clanking of harness . Buck passed through the gate from the field and crossed the road to the lot to put up old Cxsar for the noon hour . Jody said , " I best go he'p him . " But it was the fawn that drew him from the contentment of the house . He slipped into the shed to marvel at its existence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , chattering of the fawn , he beckoned him to follow . THE YEARLING I THE YEARLINGHe said , " Do n't skeer him . There he lies Buck was not as satisfying as Penny in his response . He had seen so many of Fodder-wing 's pets come and go . " He 'll likely go wild and run off , " he said , and went to the water-shelf to wash his hands before dinner . A chill came over Jody . Buck was worse than his mother to take away pleasure . He lingered a moment with the fawn , stroking it . It moved its sleepy head and nuzzled his fingers . Buck could not know of the closeness . It was all the better for being secret . He left the fawn and went to the basin and washed , too . The touch of the fawn had left his hands scented with a faint grassy pungency . He hated to wash it away , but decided that his mother might not find it as pleasant . His mother had wet and combed her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wore , a clean sacking apron over her brown calico . She said to Buck , " With only Penny to do , we ai n't got the rations plentiful like you folks . But we do eat clean and decent . " Jody looked quickly to see if Buck would take offense . Buck ladled grits into his plate and scooped a hole in the center for the fried eggs and gravy . " Now Miss Ory , do n't fret about me . Jody and me 'll slip off this evenin ' and git you a mess o ' squirrels and mebbe a turkey . I seed turkey sign the fur edge o ' the pea field . " Ma Baxter filled a plate for Penny , and added a cup of milk . " You take it to him , Jody . " He went to his father . Penny shook his head at the plate . " Hit look jest plain nasty to me , son . Set up there and feed me a spoon o ' the grits , and the milk . Hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left his face , but his arm was still three times its normal size , and his breath came heavily . He swalloweda few mouthfuls of the soft hominy and drank the milk . He motioned the plate away . " You gittin ' along all right with your baby ? " Jody reported on the moss bed . " You picked a good place . What you fixin ' to name him ? " " I jest do n't know . I want a name is real special . " Buck and Ma Baxter came into the bedroom and sat down to visit . The day was hot and the sun high and there was no hurry for anything . Penny said , " Jody 's in a tight for a name for the new Baxter . " Buck said , " Tell you , Jody , when you see Fodder-wing , he 'll pick a name . He 's got a ear for sich things , jest like some folks has got a ear for fiddle music . He 'll pick you a name is purty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jody . That spotted fawn has takened your mind off your rations . " The opportunity was choice . He went to the kitchen and heaped a plate with food and went to the shed . The fawn was still drowsy . He sat beside it and ate his dinner . He dipped his fingers in the grease-covered grits and held them out to it , but it only snuffed and turned its head away . He said , " You better learn somethin ' besides milk . " The dirt daubers buzzed in the rafters . He scraped his plate clean and set it aside . He lay down beside the fawn . He put one arm across its neck . It did not seem to him that he could ever be lonely again. 17716THE fawn took up much of Jody 's time . It tagged him whereverhe went . At the wood-pile , it interfered with the swing of his axe . The milking had been assigned to him . He was forced to bar the fawn from the lot and it stood by the gate , peering between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stripped Trixie 's teats until she kicked in protest . Each cupful of milk meant more nourishment for the fawn . It seemed to him that he could see it growing . It stood firm on its small legs and leaped and tossed its head and tail . He romped with it until they dropped together in a heap to rest and cool themselves . The days were hot and humid . Penny sweat in his bed . Buck came dripping from the fields . He discarded his shirt and worked naked to the waist . His chest was thick with black hair . The perspiration glistened on it like rain drops on black178THE YEARLINGdried moss . When she was sure he would not call for it , Ma Baxter washed and boiled the shirt and hung it in the scaldingsunshine . She said with satisfaction , " There 's that much of him , now , wo n't stink . " Buck filled the Baxter cabin until it bulged . Ma Baxter said to Penny , " First sight I catch o ' that beard and chest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a bear 's got in the house . " She was appalled at the amount of food he bolted three times a day . She could scarcely complain , since he more than made it up with the work he was doing and the game with which he supplied her . In the week he had been at the clearing , he had worked out the corn , the cow-peas and the sweet potatoes . He had cleared two acres of new ground to the west , between the pea-field and the sink-hole . He had cut down a dozen oaks and pines and sweet gums and innumerable saplings , burned the stumps and trimmed the fallen trees , so that Jody and Penny on the cross-cut saw might cut the limbs and trunks for fire-wood . He said , " You plant Sea Island cotton on that new ground , come spring , and you 'll make you a crop . " Ma Baxter said suspiciously , " You-all has got no cotton . " He said easily , " Us Forresters ai n't farmers . We 'll ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and agin , but it 's our nature to make a livin ' what I reckon you 'd call rough and easy . " She said primly , " Rough ways lands folks in trouble . " He said , " You ever know my granddaddy ? They called him Trouble Forrester . " She could not dislike him . He was as good-natured as a dog . She could only say to Penny in the privacy of night , " He works like a ox , but he 's so tormented black . Ezra , he 's black as a buzzard . " " Hit 's his beard , " Penny said . " Did I have a black beard like179THE YEARLINGthat un , I mought not look like no buzzard , but I 'd shore look like a crow . " Penny 's strength was slow in returning . The swelling from the poisoning had gone down . The skin was sloughing away where the rattler had struck him and he had cut the wounds to make the envenomed blood flow more freely . But at the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the paddle-wheels on the river steamers , and he gasped for breath and must lie flat to recover himself . He was all wiry nerves , strung like harp-strings on a frail wooden body . To Jody , the presence of Buck was a stimulation so great that he was feverish with it . The fawn alone would have had him delirious . The two together kept him in a daze , wandering from Penny 's room to wherever Buck was working , to whereverthe fawn might be , and around again . His mother said , " You 'd ought to be noticin ' all what Buck is doin ' , so you kin do it when he 's gone . " There was a tacit understanding among the three of them that Penny was to be spared . The morning of the eighth day that Buck had been at the clearing , he called Jody to the cornfield . Vandals had visited it during the night . Half a row of corn had been stripped of its ears . Mid-way of the row lay a pile of corn-husks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " ' Coons ? " " Hell , no . Foxes . Foxes love corn gooder'n I do . Two-three o ' them bushy-tailed scapers come in last night and had them a pure picnic . " Jody laughed out . " A fox picnic ! I 'd love to of seed it . " Buck said sternly , " You 'd ought to be out at night with your gun , keepin " em out . Now we 'll git ' em tonight . You got to learn to be serious . And this evenin ' we 'll rob that bee-tree by the sink-hole , and that 'll learn you how to do that . " 18oTHE YEARLINGJody went through the day impatiently . A hunt with Buck had a different quality from a hunt with his father . There was an excitement in anything the Forresters did that made him nervous and high-keyed . There was noise and confusion . A hunt with Penny held a satisfaction that was of more than the chase . There was always time to see a bird fly over , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamp . He wished that Penny were able to be about , to rob the bee-tree with them ; to go on the trail of the robber foxes . In mid-afternoon , Buck came from the new ground . Penny was sleeping . Buck said to Ma Baxter , " I 'll want a lard-pail and a axe and a heap o ' rags to burn for smudges . " There were not many rags in the Baxter household . Clothes were worn and patched and mended until they dropped in ribbons . Flour sacks went into aprons and dish-towels and chair-backs that she embroidered on winter evenings ; into backs for her patch-work quilts . Buck looked disgustedly at the small handful she gave him . He said , " Well , reckon we kin use moss . " She said , " Do n't you-all git stung , now . My grand-pappy got hisself stung oncet to where he was in the bed a fortnight . " " If we git stung , hit shore wo n't be o ' purpose . " He started across the yard with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want your blasted baby to git stung to death ? Then shut him up . " Jody led the fawn reluctantly to the shed and closed the door . He hated to be separated from it , even for honey-hunting . It seemed unjust that Penny should not be along . He had had his eye on the bee-tree all spring . He had waited for the proper time , when the bees should have gathered their nectar from the yellow jessamine , from the mulberry and the holly , the palmetto bloom and the chinaberry , the wild grapes and the peaches , and from the hawthorn and the wild plum . There181THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGwould still be bloom from which they might make their own winter store . The red bay and the loblolly were in full blossom . There would soon be sumac and goldenrod and asters . Buck said , " You know who 'd purely love to be gittin ' honey with us ? Fodder-wing . He 'll work amongst the bees so quiet , you 'd figger they was makin ' him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink-hole . Buck said , " I do n't see how you-all have made out , totin ' your water so fur . If I was n't about to be leavin ' , I 'd shore he'p you dig a well nigh to the house . " " You fixin ' to leave ? " " Well , yes . I 'm fretted about Fodder-wing . And I ai n't never lived this long without whiskey . " The bee-tree was a dead pine . Mid-way up its height , the wild honey-bees flew in and out of a deep cavity . It stood at the north edge of the sink-hole . Buck stopped by the live oaks to pull down armfuls of green Spanish moss . At the base of the pine he pointed to a pile of dried grass and feathers . " The wood-ducks tried to nest there , " he said . " They 'll see a hole in a tree , and do n't matter do it belong to a Lord God woodpecker , or one o ' them big woodpeckers with a ivory bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notion to it and they 'll try to nest in the hole . The bees has done drove these uns out . " He began to chop at the base of the dead pine . High in the air a humming sounded like a den of rattlers , far distant and turbulent . The blows of the axe echoed back and forth across the sink-hole . Squirrels , quiescent in the oaks and palm trees , began to chatter at the disturbance . Scrub jays cried shrilly . The pine shook . The humming grew into a roar . The bees sung across their heads like small shot . Buck called , " Light me a smudge , boy . Be peert . " Jody made a loose ball of moss and rags and opened Buck 's tinder horn . He struggled with flint and steel . Penny was so expert at starting a fire that it occurred to Jody in a panic thathe had never done it himself . The sparks flashed to the scorched rags that constituted the tinder , but he blew them so violently that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buck dropped the axe and ran to him and took the materials from him . He rubbed flint and steel together as vigorously as Jody had done , but he blew on the spark-touched rags with a judiciousness amazing in a Forrester . The rags blazed and he touched the fire to the moss . It began to smoke without blazing . Buck ran back to the pine and put his muscles behind the axe . Its bright blade ate into the decayed center of the tree . Its long fibers split and ripped and shivered . The pine roared in the air as though a voice had come to it to cry out with in its falling . It crashed to earth and the bees were a cloud across its dead gaping heart . Buck snatched up the smudge and darted in as quick , for all his size , as a weasel . He stuffed the smoking ball into the cavity with one thrust and ran madly . He looked more than ever like a lumbering bear . He let out a howl and slapped at his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a needle-point of fire stabbed his own neck . Buck shouted , Git down the sink-hole ! Git to the water ! " They scrambled down the steep bank . The seepage pool at the bottom was shallow for lack of rains . The water did not quite cover them when they lay in it . Buck scooped up handfulsof mud and plastered Jody 's hair and neck with it . His own thatch was a thick enough protection . A few bees followedand swung back and forth persistently . After a time Buck raised himself cautiously . He said , " They 're due to be quiet now . But ai n't we a pair o ' hogs . " Their breeches , their faces , their shirts , were caked with mud . It was not yet wash-day and Jody led the way up the south wall of the sink-hole to the wash-troughs . They sousled their clothes in one and washed themselves from the other . THE YEARLINGBuck said , " What you grinnin ' about ? " Jody shook his head . He could imagine his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Forrester clean , I 'll hive ' em a swarm . " Buck had half a dozen stings but Jody had escaped with two . They approached the bee tree cautiously . The smudge had been properly placed . The bees were drugged with the heavy smoke . They swarmed slowly around the cavity , searching for their queen . Buck split a wider opening and used his sheath knife to hack away the edges . He cleaned away trash and splinters and reached in with the knife . He turned , amazed . " Great day ! They 's a wash-tub o ' honey here . The tree 's full . " He brought out a slab , golden and dripping . The comb was rough and dark , but the honey was paler than fine syrup . They filled the lard-pail and carried it between them to the house . Ma Baxter gave them a cypress tub to take back with them . Buck said , " Now a wash tub o ' biscuits is all more is needed . " The return load was heavy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen from a bee-tree since he was a boy . He said , " When I go home tomorrer and tell my folks , they 'll not believe me . " She said slowly , " I reckon you 'll want to carry some back with you . " " No more'n I kin carry in my belly . I got my eye on twothreetrees in the swamp . Do they fail me , I 'm like to come beggin ' . " Ma Baxter said , " You 've been mighty neighborly . Mebbe some day we 'll have a plenty and kin do for you . " Jody said , " I wish you 'd not go , Buck . " The big man shoved him playfully . " With me gone , you 'll not have no time to nuss that fawn . " Buck was plainly restless . He shuffled his feet at supper and paced up and down afterward . He looked at the sky. 184THE YEARLINGHe said , " A good Clare night for ridin ' . " Jody said , " How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pacing . " I git that-a-way . I like to come and I like to go . Wherever I be , I 'm content a while , and then I jest someway ai n't contentno more .

He added in a low voice , " And I 'm right smart fretted about Fodder-wing . I got a feelin ' here  --  " he thumped his hairy chest  --  " he ai n't doin ' good . " " Would n't somebody of come ? " " That 's it . If they did n't know your Pa was bad off , they 'd of ridden over jest to say Howdy . They figgered your Pa needed he'p and they 'd not like to toll me away , was the news bad or worrisome . " He waited nervously for dark . He wanted to be done with his job , and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jody was tempted to brag of the varmints his father had disposed of , but that might cut him out of a night-prowl with Buck . He held his tongue . He helped Buck prepare the fatwood splinters for the fire-pan . Buck said , " My Uncle Cotton had red hair . They was a heap of it , stood up like a haystack , and red as a fightin ' cock 's comb . He was fire-huntin ' one night , and the handle was a mite short , and a spark from the pan set his hair a-fire . And you know when he hollered to Pa for he'p , Pa did n't pay him no mind . He jest thought the moon had done rose and was shinin ' through Uncle Cotton 's hair . " Jody gaped . " Is that true , Buck ? " Buck whittled busily . " Now if you was to tell me a tale , " he said , " I 'd not ask you no sich of a question . " 185THE YEARLINGPenny called from his bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' good notion not to leave you go without me . " They came to his room . " If ' t was a panther hunt you was goin ' on , " he said , " I 'll swear I 'd feel good enough to go with you . " Buck said , " Now I 'd jest carry you on a panther hunt , did I have my dogs . " " Why , my pair 'll out-hunt your whole pack . " He asked innocently , " How did you-all come out with that sorry dog I traded you ? " Buck drawled , " Why , that dog 's proved out the fastest and the finest and the hardest-huntin ' and the fearlessest of ary dog we 've ever had on the place . All he needed was men to train him . " Penny chuckled . He said , " I 'm proud you was smart enough to make somethin ' outen him . Where 's he now ?

I 'll carve on it , Here lies a Forrester , mourned by all his kin . " He grinned broadly and slapped the covers of his bed . " Give in , Buck , " he said , " give in . " Buck wiped his beard . " All right , " he said , " I 'll take it for funnin ' . But do n't look to Lem to take it for ary thing but a cold-out insult . " Penny said , " No hard feelin 's . I got none , and I hope you-all 'll hold none , Lem nor nobody . " " Lem 's different . He takes things personal . " 186THE YEARLING " That grieves me .

I oncet seed a pair o ' deef dummieshavin ' it . But they do say they got a sign language , and likely one passed the insult in a sign . " Buck said , " Hit 's male nature , boy . Wait ' tit you git to courtin ' and you 'll git your breeches dusted many a time . " " But nobody but Lem and Oliver was courtin ' , and here all us Baxters and all you Forresters was in to it .

All a feller kin do , is fight for what he figgers is right , and the devil take the hind-most . " Buck said , " Listen . I think I heered a fox bark then in the hammock . " At first the night seemed silent . Then sounds drifted like clouds into their hearing . An owl hooted . A tree-frog scraped his fiddle and predicted rain . Buck said , " There he be . " A thin bark sounded in the distance , shrill and mournful . Buck said , " Now would n't that be music to my pore dogs ? Would n't they sing to that sopranner ? " Penny said , " If you and Jody do n't clean out the litter tonight , bring your dogs on the next moon and we 'll have us a chase . " X87THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGBuck said , " Let 's us git goin ' , Jody . That yipper 'll about make the cornfield time we do . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll borry this tonight . Seems to me I 've seed it before . " " Jest do n't bury it beside the dog , " Penny said . " Hit 's ralely a good gun . " Jody packed his muzzle-loader over his shoulder . He went out with Buck . The fawn heard him and bleated from the shed . They walked under the mulberries and crossed the splitrailfence into the cornfield . Buck walked north down the first row . At the far end of the field he began walking across the ends of the rows . He stopped at each row and focussed the light from the fire-pan down the length of the field . Mid-way he stopped . He turned and nudged Jody . Where the light came to rest , two fiery green agates caught the light . He murmured , " Slip half-way up the row . I 'll keep the light on him . Do n't git in the path o ' the light . When his eyes looks as big as a shillin ' , give it to him , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corn at his left . The green lights were extinguished a moment , then stared again . He lifted his gun and allowed the light from the blazing splinters in the fire-pan to slip down the barrel . He pulled the trigger . The gun , as always , knocked him off balance . He started to run forward to ascertain his hit , but Buck hissed at him . " Psst . You got him . Leave him lay . Come back . " He crept along the row . Buck handed him the shotgun . " They 's likely another here clost . " They crept from row to row . This time he saw the glowing eyes before Buck saw them . He advanced down the row as before . The shotgun was a delight to handle . It was lighter than the old muzzle-loader , not so long , and easier to sight . He shot with a feeling of confidence . Again Buck called him back and he retreated . But though they combed the rows carefully , and worked around the west end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south , there were no more bright green eyes . Buck said aloud , " That 's the crop for tonight . Let 's see what we got . " Both shots had killed . One was a dog-fox and one a vixen , fat with Baxter corn . Buck said , " Now they got a litter off in a den some'eres , but they 'll be part-growed and kin make out by theirselves . Come fall , we 'll have us a fox-chase . " The foxes were gray and in good condition , with full brushes . Jody carried them in complacently . Approaching the cabin , they heard a commotion . Ma Baxter shrieked . Buck said , " Your Ma would n't romp on your Pa while he was ailin ' , would she ? " " She do n't never romp on him with nothin ' but talkin ' . " " I 'd a heap ruther a woman tore me down with a lighter 'd knot , than speakin ' sharp . " Close to the cabin , they heard Penny shout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's killin ' him . " Jody said , " Somethin 's after the fawn ! " The yard itself was not often disturbed by anything more dangerous than the small varmints . Buck hurdled the fence and Jody vaulted it after him . A light shone from the doorway . Penny stood there dressed only in his breeches . Ma Baxter was beside him , flapping her apron . Jody thought he saw a dark form move off into the night , toward the grape arbor , followed by the dogs , baying . Penny called , " Hit 's a bear ! Git him ! Git him ' fore he makes the fence ! " Sparks showered from the fire-pan as Buck ran . The light reached out to a lumbering body galloping to the east under the peach trees . Jody shouted , " Give me the fire-pan , Buck , and you do theshootin ' . " 189THE YEARLINGHe felt frightened and incompetent . They exchanged on the run . At the fence the bear turned at bay . He slashed at the dogs . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to clamber over the fence . Buck shot . The bear tumbled . The dogs broke into a tumult . Penny came running . The light showed a kill . The dogs made a pretense of having done the job , and bayed and attacked proudly . Buck was smug . He said , " This feller 'd not of come around if he 'd knowed they was a Forrester on the place . " Penny said , " He smelt things set him so wild , he 'd not of noticed the hull tribe of you . " " What was that ? " " Jody 's fawn and the new honey . " " Did he git to the fawn , Pa ? Oh Pa , the fawn ai n't hurt ? " " He never got to him . The door by luck was closed . Then he must of winded the honey and come traipsin ' around by the stoop . I figgered it was you-all comin ' back and I did n't pay no mind until he knocked the cover offen the honey . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but here I was and no gun . All me and Ory could do was holler , but I reckon it was the fiercest hollerin ' he 'd ever run into , and he lit out . " Jody was weak at thought of what might have happened to the fawn . He ran to the shed to comfort it , and found it drowsy and unconcerned . He stroked it gratefully , then returned to the men and the bear . It was a two-year-old male , in good condition . Penny insisted on helping with the dressing . They dragged the carcass to the back yard and skinned it out by the light of the fire-pan ; quartered it and hung the meat in the smokehouse . Buck said , " Now I will beg a pail o ' the fat for Ma , to make her some bear grease and cracklin 's . There 's things she jest wo n't fry without bear grease , and the old soul says bear cracklin 's and sweet pertaters rests so easy on her gums . Why , them four teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 190THE YEARLINGMa Baxter developed generosity with the plenitude . She said , " And a big piece o ' the liver goes to pore leetle Fodder-wing . Hit 'll give him strength . " Penny said , " I 'm only sad this ai n't old Slewfoot . My , would n't I love to draw the knife down his thievin ' backbone . " The foxes could wait to be skinned until morning , for the meat would be used only to cook for the chickens , with pepper , for a tonic . Buck said , " Did old man Easy Ozell ever ask you to come eat one o ' his fox pilaus ? " Penny said , " He done so . And I said , No , thank you , Easy , I 'll jest wait until you cook one o ' your dogs : " Penny was thriving on the excitement . He sat on his heels beside Buck and exchanged tales of foxes and of dogs , of strange foods and the stranger people who ate them . The yarns for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every one to go to bed . At last Penny 's new-found energy failed him , and he washed his hands and cleaned his skinning knife and joined his wife in the bed . Buck was wound up to talk half the night . Jody knew the signs and pretended to go to sleep on his pallet on the floor of his small room . Buck had been occupying his bed , his long hairy legs hanging unsupported a quarter of its length . Buck sat on the edge of the bed and talked until the lack of audience discouraged him . Jody heard him yawn and pull off his trousers and lie down on the corn shucks mattress on the creaking slats . He waited until a deep rumbling snore sounded . Then he slipped from the house and groped his way to the shed . The fawn stood up at the sound . He felt his way to it and threw his arms around its neck . It nuzzled his cheek . He picked it up and carried it to the door . It had grown so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all he could do to carry it . He tiptoed into the yard with it and set it down . It followed him willingly . He crept into the house , keeping one hand on its smooth hard191THE YEARLINGhead to guide it . Its sharp heels clicked on the wooden floor . He lifted it again and stepped cautiously past his mother 's bedroom and into his own . He lay down on his pallet and drew the fawn down beside him . He often lay so with it in the shed , or under the live oaks in the heat of the day . He lay with his head against its side . Its ribs lifted and fell with its breathing . It rested its chin on his hand . It had a few short hairs there that prickled him . He had been cudgeling his wits for an excuse to bring the fawn inside at night to sleep with him , and now he had one that could not be disputed . He would smuggle it in and out as long as possible , in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discovered , what better reason was there than the menace  --  the constant danger , he would point out  --  of bears ?  --  17  --  THERE was not a field of sweet potatoes , but an endless sea . Jody looked behind him at the rows he had finished hoeing . They were beginning to make a respectable showing , but the rows unfinished seemed to stretch to the horizon . The July heat simmered on the earth . The sand was scalding to his bare feet . The leaves of the sweet potato vines curled upward , as though the dry soil , and not the sun , were burning them . He pushed back his palmetto hat and wiped his face with his sleeve . By the sun , it must be nearly ten o'clock . His father had said that if the sweet potatoes were hoed by noon , he might go in the afternoon to see Fodder-wing , and get a name for the fawn . The fawn lay in the hedge-row in the shade of an elderberry bush . It had been almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the sweet potato beds , trampling192 193THE YEARLING I THE YEARLINGthe vines , and knocking down the edges of the beds . It had come and stood in front of him in the direct path of his hoeing , refusing to move , to force him to play with it . The wide-eyed , wondering expression of its first weeks with him had given way to an alert awareness . It had as wise a look as old Julia . Jody had almost decided that he would have to lead it back and shut it up in the shed , when of its own accord it sought the shade and lay down . It lay watching him from the corner of one big eye , its head in its favorite position , twisted back against its own shoulder . Its small white tail flicked now and then and its spotted hide rippled , shaking off flies . If it would stay quiet , he could make better time at the hoeing . He liked to work with it near . It gave him a comfortable feeling that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He attacked the weeds again lustily , and was pleased with himself to see his own progress . The rows fell away behind him . He whistled tunelessly . He had thought of many names for the fawn , had called it by each in turn , but not one pleased him . All the names by which the dogs of his acquaintance had been called , Joe and Grab , Rover and Rob , on down the line , all were inadequate . It had such a light way of walking , " tippy-toed " as Penny put it , that he would have named it Twinkle-toes and called it " Twink " for short , but that reminded him of Twink Weatherby and spoiled the name . " Tip " itself would not do , because Penny had once had an ugly and vicious bull-dog by the name . Fodder .. wing would not fail him . He had a great gift for naming his own pets . He had Racket the raccoon , Push the ' possum , Squeak the squirrel , and Preacher , the lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preacher , preacher ! " Fodder-wing said the other red-birds came to him from the forest to be married , but Jody had heard other red-birds sing the same words . At any rate , it was a good name . He had done a great deal of work in the two weeks sinceI94Buck had gone home . Penny 's strength was returning , but every now and then he became faint and dizzy and his heart pounded . Penny was sure it was the lingering effect of the rattlesnake venom , but Ma Baxter believed it was the fever , and dosed him with lemon-leaf tea . It was good to have him up and about again , with the cold fear gone . Jody tried to remember to spare him . It was so good to have the fawn , to be relieved of the dull lonely ache that had overtaken him so often , that he was filled wth gratitude for his mother 's tolerance of its presence . There was no question but that it did require a great deal of milk . It undoubtedly got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and discovered a pan of cornbread stirred up , ready for baking . It had cleaned the pan . Since then it had eaten  --  green leaves , cornmeal mixed with water , bits of biscuit , almost anything . It had to be shut in the shed when the Baxters ate . It butted and bleated and knocked dishes out of their hands . When Jody and Penny laughed at it , it tossed its head knowingly . The dogs at first had baited it , but they were now tolerant . Ma Baxter was tolerant , but she was never amused . Jody pointed out its charms . " Ai n't his eyes purty , Ma ? " " They see a pan o ' cornbread too fur . " " Well , ai n't he got a cute , foolish tail , Ma ? " " All deer 's flags looks the same . " " But Ma , ai n't it cute and foolish ? " " Hit 's foolish , a'right . " The sun crept toward its zenith . The fawn came into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the hedge-row and found a new place of shade under a wild cherry tree . Jody checked his work . He had a row and a half yet undone . He would have liked to go to the house for a drink of water , but that would cut down his remaining time too sharply . Perhaps dinner would be late . He pulled the hoe as fast as he dared without cutting the vines . When the sun stood over-head , 195THE YEARLINGhe had finished the half-row , and the full row stretched mockinglybefore him . In a moment now his mother would beat on the iron ring by the kitchen door and he would have to stop . Penny had made it plain that there would be no quarter as to time . If the hoeing was not finished by dinner time , there would be no visit to Fodder-wing . He heard steps on the other side of the fence . Penny was standing there , watching him . " A heap o ' taters , ai n't it , son ? " " Hit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , this time next year , there 'll not be one left . That baby o ' yours there , under the cherry tree , he 'll be wantin ' his share of ' em . Remember the time we had , two year gone , keepin ' the deer out ? " " Pa , I cai n't make it . I ai n't scarcely stopped all mornin ' , and I 've yet got a row . " " Well now , I tell you . I ai n't fixin ' to let you off , for I said I 'd not . But I 'll strike a bargain . You go fetch fresh water for your Ma from the sink-hole , and I 'll finish the ' taters this evenin ' . Climbin ' the walls o ' that sink-hole purely beats me . Now that 's a fair deal . " Jody dropped the hoe and started on a run for the house to get the water-buckets . Penny called after him , " Do n't try to tote ' em plumb full . A yearling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckets alone were heavy . They were of hand-hewn cypress , and the ox-yoke from which they hung was of white oak . Jody hung the yoke over his shoulders and trotted down the road . The fawn loped after him . The sink-hole was dark and still . There was more sunlight in the early morning and at evening , than at noon , for the thick leaves of the trees cut off the overhead sun . The birds were still . Around the sandy rim of the sink-hole they were nooning and dusting themselves . In late afternoon they would fly down for water . The doves would come , and the jorees , the red-birds and the bee-martins , the196THE YEARLINGmocking-birds and the quail . He could not be too hurried to run down the steep slope to the bottom of the great green bowl . The fawn followed and they splashed together across the pool . The fawn bent its head to drink . He had dreamed of this . He said to it , " Some day I 'll build me a house here . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all live here by the pool . " A frog leaped and the fawn backed away . Jody laughed at it and ran up the slope to the drinking trough . He leaned over it to drink . The fawn , following , drank with him , sucking up the water and moving its mouth up and down the length of the trough . At one moment its head was against Jody 's cheek and he sucked in the water with the same sound as the fawn , for the sake of companionship . He lifted his head and shook it and wiped his mouth . The fawn lifted its head , too , and the water dropped from its muzzle . Jody filled the buckets with the gourd dipper that hung on the rim of the trough . Against his father 's warning , he filled them nearly full . He would like to walk into the yard with them . He crouched and bent his shoulders under the yoke . When he straightened , he could not rise against the weight . He dipped out part of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of the slope . The wooden yoke cut into his thin shoulders . His back ached . Halfway home , he was obliged to stop and set down the buckets and pour out more of the water . The fawn dipped its nose inquisitively into one of the buckets . Fortunately , his mother need not know . She could not understand how clean the fawn was , and would not admit how sweet it smelled . They were at dinner when he reached the house . He lifted the buckets to the water shelf and shut up the fawn . He filled the water pitcher from the fresh buckets and took it in to the table . He had worked so hard and was so hot and tired that he was not particularly hungry . He was glad of this and was able to set aside a large portion of his own dinner for the fawn . The197THE YEARLING THE YEARLINGmeat was a pot-roast from the bear 's haunch , pickled in brine for keeping . It was a trifle coarse , with long fibers , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as good as venison . He made his meal on the meat , with a helping of collardgreens , and saved all his cornpone and his milk for the fawn . Penny said , " We was mighty lucky ' t was a young bear like this un come scaperin ' under our noses . Had it of been a big ol ' male , we could n't of et the meat this time o ' year . The bears mates in July , Jody , and allus remember the meat o ' the males ai n't fitten when they 're matin ' . Do n't never shoot one then unless it 's botherin ' you . " " Why ai n't the meat fitten ? " " Now I do n't know . But when they 're courtin ' , they 're mean and hateful " " Like Lem and Oliver ? " "  --  like Lem and Oliver .

They 'll stay in pairs all through July , mebbe into August . Then the males goes off and the cubs is borned in February . And do n't you think a male , like ol ' Slewfoot , wo n't eat them cubs do he come on ' em . That 's another reason I hate bears . They ai n't natural in their affections . " Ma Baxter said to Jody , " You look out , now , walkin ' to Forresters ' today . A matin ' bear 's a thing to shun . " Penny said , " Jest keep your eyes open . You 're all right as long as you see a creetur first and do n't take him by surprise. 198Even that rattlesnake that got me , why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' out for hisself . " Ma Baxter said , " You 'd stick up for the devil hisself . " " I reckon I would . The devil gits blamed for a heap o ' things is nothin ' but human cussedness . " She asked suspiciously , " Jody finish his hoein ' like he belonged to ? " Penny said blandly , " He finished his contract . " He winked at Jody and Jody winked back . There was no use in trying to explain the difference to her . She was outside the good male understanding . He said , " Ma , kin I go now ? " " Let 's see . I 'll need a mite o ' wood toted in " Please do n't think up nothin ' long to do , Ma . You would n't want I should be so late gittin ' home tonight the bears 'd git me . " " You be later'n dark gittin ' home and you 'll wish ' t was a bear had you , ' stid o ' me . " He filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him change his shirt and comb his hair . He fretted at thedelay . She said , " I jest want them dirty Forresters to know there 's folks does live decent . " He said , " They ai n't dirty . They jest live nice and natural and enjoy theirselves . " She sniffed . He let out the fawn from the shed , fed it from his hand , held the pan of milk mixed with water for it to drink , and the two set off . The fawn ran sometimes behind him , sometimes ahead , making short forays into the brush , boundingback to him in an alarm that Jody was sure was only pretended . Sometimes it walked beside him , and this was best . He laid his hand , then , lightly on its neck , and fitted the rhythm of his two legs to its four . He imagined that he was another fawn . He bent his legs at the knees , imitating its walk . He threw his head up , alertly . A rabbit-pea vine was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and twined it around the fawn 's neck for a halter . The rosy blooms made the fawn so pretty that it seemed to him even his mother would admire it . If it faded before he returned , he would make a fresh halter on the way home . At the cross-roads near the abandoned clearing , the fawn halted and lifted its nostrils into the wind . It pricked up its ears . It turned its head this way and that , savoring the air . He turned his own nose in the direction on which it seemed to settle . A strong odor came to him , pungent and rank . He felt the hair prickle on the back of his neck . He thought he heard a low rumbling sound and then a snapping that might be of teeth . He was tempted to turn tail and head for home . Yet he would always wonder what the sounds had been . He moved one step at a time around the turn in the road . The fawn stayed motionlessbehind him . He stopped short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hundred yards distant . They were on their hind legs , walking like men , shoulder to shoulder . Their walk seemed almost a dance , as when couples in the square dance moved side by side to do a figure . Suddenly they jostled each other , like wrestlers , and lifted their forepaws , and turned , snarling , each trying for the other 's throat . One raked his claws across the other 's head and the snarls grew to a roar . The fighting was violent for a few moments , then the pair walked on , boxing , jostling , parrying . The wind was in Jody 's favor . They could never smell him . He crept down the road after them , keeping his distance . He could not bear to lose sight of them . He hoped they would fight to a finish , yet he should be terrorized if one should end the fight and turn his way . He decided that they had been fighting for a long time and were exhausted . There was blood in the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each shoulder-to-shoulder walking was slower paced . As he stared , a female walked out of the bushes ahead with threeTHE YEARLINGmales following her . They turned silently into the road and walked on in single file . The fighting pair swung their heads a moment , then fell in behind . Jody stood until the procession passed from sight , solemn and ludicrous and exciting . He turned and ran back to the cross-roads . The fawn was nowhere to be seen . He called and it emerged from the scrub growth at the side of the road . He took the Forresters ' road and ran down it . Now that it was over , he shook at his own boldness . But it was done now , and he would follow again , for all men were not privileged to see the creatures in their private moments . He thought , " I 've seen a thing . " It was good to become old and see the sights and hear the sounds that men saw and heard , like Buck and his father . That was why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or on the earth before the camp-fire , while men talked . They had seen marvels , and the older they were , the more marvels they had seen . He felt himself moving into a mystic company . He had a tale now of his own to tell on winter evenings . His father would say , " Jody , tell about the time you seed the two male bears fightin ' down the road . " Above all , he could tell Fodder-wing . He ran again , for pleasure in his hurry to tell his friend his story . He would surprise him . He would walk up to Fodder-wing in the woods , or back of the house among his pets , or to his bed , if he were still ailing . The fawn would walk beside him . Fodder-wing 's face would shine with its strange brightness . He would hunch his twisted body close and put out his gentle and crooked hand and touch the fawn . He would smile , to know that he , Jody , was content . After a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perhaps peculiar , but it would be beautiful . Jody reached the Forrester land and hurried under the live oaks into the open yard . The house was somnolent . There was no curl of smoke from the chimney . There were no dogs **27;5681;TOOLONG opening Wednesday and university rush week Friday , the stores full of new clothes for the coeds and their ambitious mothers . Sunday the World had carried a double page of photographs of prominent outstate freshman girls to come in , a sort of sorority shopping guide , with the fathers conveniently listed by name and business , and representing a little more money . Here and there a store manager who had called the weather bureau came down to the curb to look at the drippingsky for himself . Unsettled , and general rain , the meteorologistpredicted for Wednesday night 's opening , with all the windows newly decorated to draw the crowds out , Schendler 's even going back to their living models , like in the old days of the twenties . The worried men took the early edition of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHOT IN GUN BATTLE , and forgot the weather . Crumpling the paper in their soft hands and without troubling to discover that this shooting was not even by their police and deputies they hurried in to dictate protests to their SenatorBullard against this interference with business in the peaceful city . Out in Herb 's Addition two men came for Hamm . Seriousfacedat their report , he called Carl Halzer and then hurried down to the jail and found what he had learned to expect in his twenty years as reporter of labor troubles . On a bare cell cot lay Lew Lewis , his face empty in semi-consciousness , on the floor beside him stood a tin bucket of bloody water , the wound in his shoulder packed with a wet , bloodstained towel , the round hole under it seeping a persistent string of red . At the desk Hamm was told that they could not be chasingtheir prisoners around to hospitals and things . Anyway , that big bruiser 'd be all right where he was . The city physicianhad come in around four , gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got to raising hell . He 'd had a couple and was sleeping pretty , with his wound all washed and dressed.  |p101The  wound dressed  --  with a folding of wet towel ? And what about the bullet ? Still in there , if it did n't come out on the other side , they said , staring at Hamm 's scar as it reddened . Hell , lots of people was walking around good as anybody with bullets in them  --  no worse than knifings , the officers said , laughing . For one minute he wanted to throw his name into the faces around him , to watch these men fall on their fat bellies before the big sound of the name of Hammond . But before he could bring himself to any action there was a roar at the outer door of the jail , a clatter and a banging in the corridor . Carl Halzer had arrived . In twenty minutes he had Lew in the hospital . Dr. Russ Snell gave the man one good look and hurriedaway to the office . " Call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have them send reporters and photographers out im-mediately ! " Before Lew was ready for the operating room , the Franklin men were there , listening sourly to the doctor 's denunciation , looking uneasily towards the Grandapolis representatives as they photographed the trucker with the wet towel dressing , took notes . They 'd cook up a pretty stink on the capital city . Hamm watched the whole procedure with impatience but knew that Dr. Snell did n't intend to have the case covered up as an unavoidable injury to a lawbreaker . This was one citizen shooting another , shooting to kill , and with the criminalnegligence at the city jail , it might very well succeed . He would force an investigation if he could . For the second time on this rainy day , business men along the avenue thumped their newspapers and talked loud to their secretaries . Now it was the Grandapolis Inquirer , carrying a picture of the injured trucker on the front page , playing up the inhumanity of the capital city , and reporting that one of the more popular police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in protest against the Lewis affair . But they called the fight a gun battle , too , with both Lew and his spell partner , the only witnesses , swearing it was their fists against two strikebreakers with rifles  --  " unidentified men " as the police kept calling them , even though both of the strikers reported the number of the car the gunmen used , a Red Line Conveyer number . The Franklin papers said almost nothing except that the man injured in last night 's outbreak of violence had been removed to Samaritan Hospital for observation by Dr. Russ Snell , pointing him out by name as a warning against mixing in . Hamm knew the doctor well , often went out to his home in the evenings . The capital city called him lacking in ambition because he was content with the small practice his wife 's father left him . But it assured Doctor Russ , as everyone called him , a moderately secure existence , with time enough for the crippled children across the street from the old home . He was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandstone . His hands , with the fingers usually curled in upon themselves like a baby 's or a monkey 's , were the heavy burrendsto the hanging oak of his arms . But at the hospital the children waited hours for his step and when the doors closed upon him and he was gone from the walk below , their watching for the next call had already begun . He never talked of his work , but out as far as Wild Horse Plains and far beyond the state were strong and straight young people who wrote him grateful letters each year on their birthdays like the cramped little note from a Swedish boy in Stockholm : " Todaymy father and I run together clear to the west forty and back for a present on my birthday for you " ; or the one from the little girl at Walden : " We have a sparrow nest in my old brace hanging up in the grainery . Mother says to let them use it for my birthday present to you . She thinks maybe the old harness gets lonesome , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " Letters like these Doctor Russ laid away to the memory of the crippled sister he had to see trampled to her deathp103under the hoofs of a mad bull because she could not run and he was too small to help . As he grew up the memory remained a hard and green thing within him , so he turned to the study of medicine . By the time he was done , redheaded Ona Shelley had married him , given him her father 's practice . During the last few years Russ Snell had calls to far and fine positions but he preferred to stay in Franklin , near the little cripples , with his books , his small daughter , and his energetic , laughing wife . Ona Snell arranged the programs for the League of Women Voters , and fought the conservative membership almost singlehanded to give the younger candidatesof every party a good hearing . She got herself appointed to the city library board and helped clean up the paralysis brought on by inbred management and ten years of shrinking appropriation much as her husband fought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two years ago , there was a letter from an old classmate in medical collegewho was with an ambulance in Republican Spain . He wrote of a friend , a Spanish doctor who died in Franco 's prison pens , leaving an orphaned son of ten , sensitive and brilliant and fine as his father . The Spells were reading the letter together . They looked at each other , and then grinned a little under their moist eyes , for they had said the same words exactly together : " Let 's take him ! " So they carried their baby bonds down to the post office and after a long wait the boy came , with a tag on his coat . He was incredibly thinleggedand had a shock of gleaming rye straw hair that fell into his eyes , deep , and night-dark with what they had seen . He had two prides . He could speak the English , and he was no longer like falling walls inside when he heard the airplane come . They had taken him home by way of Stoor 's Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first given to the world . But it was the slim white deer behind the high fence that made the boy cry out his first word of Spanish ,  | and then blush with shame and correct himself . He was sorry . It had made him think of his father  --  and the fences with the prisoners inside . " I promise I will remember it that I am the American now , " he said , speaking very formally , as though repeating a ritual . So , somebody had been at the boy . Quietly Ona Snell put her arm about the thin shoulder . " No , " she told him , " here , too , you will be what you are , a fine young son of Spain , come to live with us in America . " Gravely the boy thanked her , his dark eyes upon her , without understanding . "  --  Son of Spain ? " he asked finally , with embarrassment . Could one here perhaps be Jose  --  like his father ? But of course . Jose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Consumers ' Co-operative and because neither she nor the doctor had ever seen Hamm Rufe when he was still of the Hammonds of the capital city , he felt free to go there , to sit easily among them with the sound , the whole side of his face turned towards the light . Sometimes on Sunday afternoons little Onie crawled up on his knee to see his sick cheek , perhaps even asking to touch it . " Ouu ! Hurty-hurt ! " she always cried , shuddering within herself , making the boy Jose come once more to see , calling upon her dad to make it well . Here , at the Snells ' , Hamm met the liberals of the universitycampus , in one of the few places where they felt secure to speak out . Sometimes they turned upon themselves as teachers , castigating their craven hiding of honest opinions . But a man with a family  --  what was he to do ?  --  speaking just like the renters out over the breaks of the Little Grand , and many a man beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who specializedin frontier history and spoke heatedly of the wasted vision of Jefferson . " He could see that if the tremendous re/sources of the Louisiana Purchase were not kept out of private hands nothing short of a revolution would ever make their full benefits available to society or save us from the tyranny of their power . " Sometimes Walford , teaching the Continental Novel , and his wife who sponsored the little theater , were there too . Till Walford had deliberately chosen to live in the middle west , in whose streams he saw man 's one hope for escape from the trap into which the industrial revolution had thrust him . Here , with so much fertile soil , and with its unlimited waterpower regulated for cheap and competitive use , he saw scattered factory units grow up in small , semiruralcommunities , each man a farmer and a worker . Here the family of the future would grow up free of the menaceof hot winds and the devastating drouths , of slum disease , layoffs  --  grow up healthy and strong in body and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Till 's vision , and of the place of the arts among the people of this newer world , this better world to come . They had taken a refugee too , a Jewish boy from Leipzig , where Till studied . He was eleven now , black-thatched , with fingers fine as carved ivory and eyes that searched out every face . He was the son of a small publisher killed by the Nazis . He and Jose were inseparable . It was the evenings with these people that made the old shack out at Herb 's Addition such an empty place to Hamm , made him sit long on his couch with the picture of Stephani in his hands . Deliberately , it seemed he had chosen this place for a retreat from life , and now out there in the hospital , under the hand of Dr. Snell , lay a strong young trucker with a bullet deep in his body . By Monday there was no one in Franklin , unless it was the collector of White House stories , who had n't heard of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty contest . Those from the foot of Blue Ridge found it most amusing , the clerks and office workers screamingly funny  --  that high-hat Marylin Welles and the Polanders drinking beer together . Yes , but Marylin Welles with her mother 's Dachel , that was even better , and getting caught in the Saturday night raid , with both their names right out in the paper . " Like old times , " the Coot said as he warmed his wet feet at the stove of the shelterhouse out in Herb 's Addition . " Like back when the sons of the carriage trade was listed in all the round-ups of old Sixth Street . " Yes , the sons got in the papers in the old days , Hamm thought as he watched the Coot 's shoes steam , the sons , but never the daughters , or with their mothers ' boy friends . That was new , and planned . All day Sunday Cassie 's telephone had been busy , and Monday too , with sweet voices offering sympathy , saying " Poor , poor dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides Hamm remembered that the Welles family owned stock in both the Franklin papers . Then there was talk that Cassie engineered the raid herself , like school authorities getting rid of a teacher that could n't be fired because of his following . " Well , by God , the old gal may be a little butt-sprung but she 's got a head on her , " the Coot told his cronies as he shook his pants down over his dry shoes and started home , humming . Yes , she was up and coming all right , and old Cobby just barely cold out on the hill , they said to each other , their faces turning towards Blue Ridge across the dark town . By Monday Cassie Welles began to be a little sorry she had reported the El Troc for raiding . It was making Marylinmore popular than she ever was , even as the town 's firstp107empress . Still , it fitted her notion of a smart young society matron with a rival daughter . Like in Harper 's Bazaar . So she commanded Marylin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she considered , the girl , the first time in her mother 's house since Cobby 's death , and really a little selfconscious . " You will , of course , be immediately off to wherever it is you are planning to go  --  " Cassie announced . But at the open attack the daughter was instantly at ease , smiling a little , curling her short upper lip from her scalloped teeth , exactly as she did ten years ago when her mother warned her about petting for little girls of sixteen . She emptied the glass , picked out the olive and chewed around it , with her lips drawn back . " Oh , I 'm not planning on going anywhere just yet  --  " she finally said , pounding her cigarette twice , hard , a habit she picked up from a black-bearded young writer down in Arizona . " No  --  not just yet . " Color crept up Cassie 's softening neck . " Then I shall be compelled to take Dachel away  --  " The girl laughed over her match . That lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as he had a soft nest , and certainly his comings and goings could be of no interest to her . " No  --  ? " No . It was a Imp that was keeping her here . A man whose shoulders were like a stone beaming above her head , a man with hair like sun on a fall hillside , and eyes like a winter stream , dark and deep and swift . " My , are n't we poetic ? " the mother exclaimed . " And who may this superman be ? " It was a man called the Bellowing Bull of Bashan  --  a farm boy from down yonder . Cassie Welles laughed , liked the sound of it from a mother to her romantic daughter , and laughed again .   " I know , " Marylin told her , from full , curled lip . " My low tastes , like my father 's  --  " That stopped the posing . Yes , Cassie Welles admitted to herself , she might have said that , if she had n't been too relieved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in antagonizing the girl . Recalling the dozens of men who had passed through her fuchsia-nailed fingers during the last ten years , bankers ' sons , cowboys , poets , even a fake Russian nobleman , and all with no particular after-effect , the mother could n't very well balk at a farmer . In fact he might help fill in the interval between Cobby 's funeral and Arizona or Sun Valley , or wherever one would be going this fall if one were twenty-six . This man , Cassie Welles inquired  --  he had won some prizes at the fair , perhaps grew something special , pumpkinsor something ? He probably did ; otherwise he would n't be coming to the fairs . She 'd have Dora look it up . They would need some of whatever it was , for those dreary farms Cobby had accumulated along the Wakoon River . She would write him to call . Pleased , Marylin did stay for lunch , with Dachel up but sulking in his room , refusing to appear until she was gone . It seemed she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the jail Saturday . He had been so humiliatedand did n't have a handkerchief with him . That could happen to anyone , could n't it ?  --  anyone sensitive enough . All Herb 's Addition knew about tow-headed young Burt 's hard turn-down by the Tyndale girl . They wondered what he had expected from big bugs like them . But they felt sorry for the kid , Hamm having to fetch him home late Sunday night , still drunk and sick as a calf . Early the next morning the old Coot slushed down through the wet to offer advice . " What you 'd ought a been made to do was drink a bottlep109of milk before you was put to bed  --  An ' next time you better take up with one a them pretty Polak girls . They wo n't do you like that Tyndale outfit . " Burt only pillowed the misery of his first real hangover in his palms and wished he could poke the old Coot in the face . But that would n't dispose of Margaret Tyndale 's determination to make something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He need n't think she liked fat-necked Milo Groves any better than he did . Hamm knew what was in the mother 's mind . Milo was the nephew of Josina Black , and the grandson of Jacob Stoor , donor of the capital city 's only ambitious park . It lay on the breaks southeast of town , with curving drives that wound through the formal entrance , past the golf links and out over rougher knolls dotted with clumps of new-planted juniper , like tufts of unruly hair in a wind . The shaggy sod of the breaks had been torn up long ago , its earth-nested little clumps of Easter daisies , fragrant wallflowers , purple sweet peas , and June roses ; its midsummer clumps of flaming Indian paint root ; and its autumn pussytoes and purple wand that used to fill the winter vases of the town  --  all these were gone . In their place thousands of peonies were arranged in orderly patterns of red and pink and white on smoothed slopes and terraces . Below , on the artificial lakes and ponds , clip-winged wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers along the bank when no far-bound flocks were passingoverhead . On Sunday afternoons hundreds of middle Franklinites pushed themselves back reluctantly from their dinner tables and drove the two miles to the park , telling any visitors the story of the city 's one big land feud , back before the railroad days . It was a feud between two men , wild-haired Eli Jiles , who picked on the far , high ridge west of the river and built the old Stone House , while Jacob Stoor settled close in and bought up a pre-emption of rolling land on this side . Theyp110were like opposite forces , Stoor on the side of the righteous , a member of the Red Ribbon club for temperance , and a prudentand saving man , while old Eli smoked , drank , whored a little , and kept race horses , even laid out a track on the tableland beyond his house . At first it seemed that the fashionabledistrict would follow the horses and the devil but the forces of thrift and morality won , as was inevitable , particularlyafter Jacob got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's land legalized over old Eli 's loudest protests . From the foresight and prudence of Jacob Stoor the city received this beautiful park with nice picnic grounds , far enough out to eliminate the baby-buggy trade and the messier and more destructive element that did so much damage to the formal rose gardens at old City Park . Besides , the distancesaved everyone in town the smell of the deer , the elk , and the one lone buffalo , morose and shaggy as an old man living too far beyond his generation . On the highest point there was a graveled parking where one might stop to look over the wide bottoms of the Little Grand . In the foreground were the old stockyards and the desertedpacking plant , then the smoke of the switchyards and the vague clustering of the business section beyond . On the far side Little Warsaw , the smoking dumps , and Herb 's Additionwere lost against the blue hogback of Grandview Hill . Only the capitol tower rose high and clean through the smoke and haze that clung like dusty cobwebs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift-winged teal would sweep by , to settle on the ponds among their ground-fast kind , or a string of riding-academy horses come along the bridle path , pushed into a canter by much offside kicking , the riders trying hard to hold position on the flat saddles , to make a showing , for a dollar and a half an hour from a stenographer 's pay is a dollar and a half . Old Jacob Stoor started his grocery business with a push/cart in Grandapolis when the mud of its streets was still churned by the feet of freight oxen and frontier cavalry . At the first homestead opening he moved up to file on a quarter of free land on Mud Creek , taking the cart along . Soon he had a little store , and then a bigger one , finally a wholesale outfit , and , as his son-in-law always said , fortunately died before he had to compete with chain stores and bootleg truckers . His wife had died over ten years ago . But long before then the Stoor house that proved up the homestead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the maples in the back cut out , only a few petunias could bloom where she used to have clumps of magnificent peonies , a bed of cross-bred zinnias , two snowball bushes , and a plot of old country painted daisies on one hundred sixty acres of land . So she died , squeezed on all sides while her man still owned two thousand acres of land almost within sight of her bed . One thousand of this he left to the town for Stoor 's Park , with money for its development , and a bronze plaque for the red sandstone gate pillars :  --  IN BLESSED MEMORYOFELIZA ECHERT STOORERECTED BY HERSORROWING HUSBANDJACOB ALBERT JOHANN STOORThe wholesale business was managed by J. B. Groves , under the eyes of the three Stoor girls , as Jacob 's daughters were still called , J. B. 's wife as spinsterish as the other two . They were directors of a trust company too , and still owned the old retail grocery , not really much any more except a cause for complaint and calamity . Eliza , the eldest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set sharp against all dangerousinnovations , such as adding experimental magazines like Esquire or radical ones like the Nation to the reading rooms , or installing modern stools in the toilets . Eli Jiles left a park too . Because his protests against the garbage dumping went ignored and the city moved east from the Mud Creek to Jacob Stoor 's holdings , Eli left the whole clay slope from Stone House almost to the Polish bottoms to the Knights of the Road , as he called them in his will . He left plans and money for the building and upkeep of a shelterhouse , with heat , water , and toilet facilities , and a penny coffeeand doughnut corner . Within this forty-acre park outside the city limits no one should ever be questioned or disturbed except for a criminal offense . It was long a barren spot , with only a few temporary campers on the grounds , but the shelterhousealways had a handful of guests who did n't mind the scrubdowns . During harvest migrations and hard times hundreds of the far-homed stopped here for a night or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower and slept indoors , if not it was a newspaper under a clay bank and penny coffee and sinkers at Joe 's next morning , even if there were no pennies . Bums ' Rest , Jiles Park was called , and it seemed symbolic of the man who left it . But after 1929 the slope began to fill up with the huts and shacks and dugouts of the homeless . A transient got a piece of an old walnut bed from the dumps and carved the professional-looking signboard at the entrance :  --  HERB 'S ADDITIONAnd while there were protesting letters to the papers , and denunciatory editorials about the festering sore at the gateway of the noble city of Franklin , there was less trouble here , unpolicedand almost unlighted , than on the far slope of Blue Ridge where the best people lived . And what there was usually came from the jallopy trade , as the Coot called it ; dispossessed families on wheels stopping on their way south before thep113winds of November or headed west toward the golden land of opportunity , California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a foundation of the Coot 's old bricks , with log walls and porches . Joe Miller , a bald little bachelor , ran the place . He was one of the bonus marchers who stopped in on the way back from Washington after Hoover broke up their encampment on the Potomac . " With steel hats and Tommy guns , " Joe always ended his story the few times he could be urged to say anything about it . By now only the newer comers referred to it . To the rest it was as taboo in Joe 's presence as a public jilting , or the public elopement of a wife . He was an army cook , was clean as an old-maid aunt , and hated the town across the bottoms  --  just the man Eli Jiles would have picked . Scattered around the shelterhouse were over thirty shacks , including Townsend Club No. 6 , sixteen feet square , cooperativelybuilt and owned , and the half a dozen dugouts and caves besides the one the Coot lived in , which was on his own land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two among them , and even a few families , like the Dillards , who housed four small children in a seven-by-ten shack of boards and rusty sheet tin , with a sagging old screen door on leather hinges . Fortunately one of the WPA privies was put up right handy to the young Dillards , and was immediately their special pride , with its roominess and clean white paint . It was then that Herb 's Addition made its one appearance in the Sunday society section of the World :  --  West Franklin Civic Improvement Club meets Monday for official opening of their new community house , 260 Jiles Road . Music by Wind Sisters , paper by Mr. M. Ward . It never happened again , for the telephone began ringing as soon as the paper hit the street Saturday night and the manag- ing editor came swearing up through the newsroom to fire the green girl who let the item past while the society editor was out to supper . The early settler among the squatters in the Addition was Old Connie , who scrubbed offices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked after her bedridden Henry , that some people said was n't even her husband . But she stuck to him , in a shack with floor cracks big enough for rabbits to crawl through . Every fall Hamm and Dillard patched the tar-paper siding and banked it up high all around to keep the wind out from underfoot . Only one youngish woman lived alone in Herb 's Addition . She was known as Sophie , and seldom came out in the daytime unless her little , striped red kitten got away . Several times a week it would come creeping through the grass like some wild tiger , springing out upon Hamm Rufe 's foot , to nibble delicately at the strings , to rub against his pants , making a rumble like distant thunder . Nobody knew anything much about Sophie . She showed up in Old Scotty 's shack last spring , about a week after he died . She fixed it up nice , hunting the dumps with more diligence than any of the others . The women went over to talk , to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuses . Even Hamm showed up at her door one evening , the red kitten asleep across his arm . But he got no encouragement either , not even for a moment 's visiting . She spoke well and calmly the few things she found it necessary to say to these neighbors , and it was plain she was n't like the last young woman in the Addition , the one whose place got to smelling Lysol clear out to the road . Hamm 's favorite neighbor was lean old Cash Overtill who came in six , seven years ago . He borrowed a saw somewhere and built himself and his wife a fine hooverville with a bit of kitchenette in the far end and padded wall benches under the windows . With the drop boards raised , the benches made a narrow bed on each side of the seven-foot room . Under themp115Cash stored his sacks of seeds , a bushel of good fall wheat , a bit of Turkistan alfalfa , and some corn he 'd been developing , hoping that sometime there 'd be a plot of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreclosed off his place in Ohio in the seventies . He had come west in a wagon with a sack of seed corn for a pillow . Only now the free land was gone and a man who 'd been put off a Kanewa Investment place could n't get on any company-owned land . Although he was a good farmer , he was permanently blacklisted because he marched on the capitol back in 1933 with the rest . " Sometimes it 's a relief not to have to make up cash rent , with the drouth an ' all , " he told Hamm once . But he did wish he had a spot of ground that was n't like a bucket of lye soap when it rained and nothing but brick when it dried . He had some good corn he was developing . Monday 's rain brought down an early darkness , and Carl Halzer , going to Wallgrin for a campaign talk , dropped Hamm off at the fork to the Addition , the wet clay trail inside too slick for any wheel . Even the cinder paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were soft underfoot . Hamm found his shack empty , Burt Parr gone . In the shaded glow of his wall lamp the little room was very pleasant , the old bricks of the fireplace blending softly into the rosefleckedbuilding paper of the walls . The horizontal windows above the bookcases were covered with dull blue denim curtainsand at the head of the daybed was Hamm 's only luxury , a good radio that brought him symphonies from all over America , and from London and Paris , even from Salzburg back before Anschluss . Over the fireplace was the picture that puzzled the Coot so , a sketch of a young woman with the hair rising loosely on each side of her high-winged temples , wide cheekbones slanting to a firm chin , eyes long and deepsetunder tilted brows  --  Stephani.  | Hamm had been to the hospital again . Lew 's fever was high , his shoulder swollen tight and round , Russ Snell and his friend Dr. Klech , refugee German army surgeon , watching , talking over man 's age-old struggle for freedom and the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to remind himself that this was only one more incident in the long years , but for over twelve of them he had Stephani beside him , and this dreary night it was as though he had lost her yesterday , yesterday , instead of almost eight years ago . He met her in 1919 , after he had put in two years of life on the road , in hobo jungles , and with the Wobblies in at least a dozen strikes . He had been in jail as many times , too , chiefly because he was blacklisted as a sympathetic reporter . The first time they got him only a tricky heart saved him from an army training camp or jail as a slacker and draft evader . After that he was usually just pounded up and kicked out of town . It was during the police strike at Boston that he really got hurt , and that a fifteen-year-old girl dragged him away . He remembered the soldiers rushing the crowds along the street , and that he tripped on something , probably one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a uniformed man brought a rifle down two-handed , like a woodchopper 's axe , across his face and the wrist . When he came to , someone had him under the arms and was half-carrying , half-pulling him down an alley . As his head cleared he discovered that it was a girl , young evidently , but strong as a boy and whispering urgent silence upon him in broken English . It turned out that this girl knew somethingof men , particularly of armed forces loose among civilians . " Come , come , make quick ! " she kept urging . " What they do not find they can not kill  --  " And so with his head poundingwith pain , an arm hanging limp , and warm blood , fresh and salty , in his mouth , he tried to help the girl get himp117through a little basement doorway into a lamplit room that he did n't leave for a month . The girl turned out to be Stephani Kolhoff , the daughter of a village printer from Poland , who had fled to America in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the war came , and the girl had to see many things . The hardest of them was to stand by while her crippled brother of sixteen was shot down for hiding wounded soldiers of the enemy . Enemy !  --  What was the word to them ? To her father no needy man was an enemy , whether of their own oppressors or of an invader . A month later she and her mother were beaten for the same offense by the other side , their home burned , their last goat driven away , and much of the time she had to hide for now she would do as well as a woman for soldiers who had made war for a long , long time . Then by Christmas , 1918 , they were in what seemed this so safe a land of America with Anton , the printer . Almost at once they learned that man is much the same here , and becomesoppressor whenever he can , and so this immigrant girl who was no stranger to treachery and to violence was afraid to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as she could with her mother 's fearful help . Yes , yes , truly , this was America , but here too were beatings on the streets ; might it not only give more beatings and worse also when they were discovered ? A month later , still pale and weak , a shocking red scar across his cheek and nose , Hamm came out into the sunlight of Boston Common for the first time . He sat under the bright October leaves that were falling so quietly upon the row of benches full of the poor , the homeless , and the lost . But he was not of them , for if he watched carefully he might see Stephani 's red tam rise out of the roaring hole of the subway that would bring her back from work , bring her to him . And as she approached he recalled the sweet wildness of her lips that was like the sun-ripened plums in the thickets atp118home , and like spring thunder over the greening fields of Kanewa . That was over twenty years ago , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to get a job but the violent scar was against him , and the fact that he had neither the muscle to compete with the immigrant and the returning doughboy , nor the training for anything else . So he kept on writing about the workingman , the growing unemployment that brought wage cuts , strikes , organized strikebreaking , and violence . He went from one strife region to another ; from one social ulcer to another , the outspoken Stephani called it . She went with him , always a part of the nation-wide , world-wide struggle ; he never more than an observer , a bystander . They saw much violence and many things besides in those years together , sad things , and amusing ones , like the old sod house with Venetian blinds and two painted lawn chairs beforeit out on the sagebrush plains of middle Wyoming . Then there were fine things , like the slim green-black trees standing aloof from the highway down towards Santa Fe , or the miles of pink rambler roses spilling over the railroad cuts around Providence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the once lovely countryside of Indiana and Illinois now cut into gingham crossbars by roads ; the woods gone , the lakes and ponds drained , even the streams laid out by compass through knoll and hill to carry the water quickly away ; to dry out the uplands , flood the lower river regions , and do violence to all the beauty of nature 's curving lines . They saw dead things too , like Central City , just beginning to be overrun by the arty revival folks , gaudy as the fireweed that crept over the old mine tailings ; and the dry-rot of lower Manhattan , a diseased potato that looked good enough on the outside , and still firm , perhaps a little too firm to the touch  --  black and empty inside . There were disturbing things , like the grey and tired figure of ' Gene Debs the day he came out of Atlanta , broken inp119health , sheared of his civil rights , the old convicts blubbering to see the man who was their brother go . Five years later Hamm stood beside Stephani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world would see few more sincerely mourned . He went to all these places with Stephani , for long ago she had openly become the leader , as she really was from the moment she dragged him into her basement home . He was like those others born in Franklin , mere followers , his brother and all the others here , content with the feel of money flowing under their hands , their mothers ' money , or their grandmothers ' , or someone much farther removed ; even exhilarated by the movement , as though it were their own making , like the blanket of green plantlets rising and falling with the pulse of a turgid stream . All content but Cobby . He got away , and somehow it was good to think of that . He , Rufer Hammond , born to indecisionand to inaction , was only good for following , or like river scum , for dipping on the surface of a slow stream . In those years with Stephani he wrote a great many items and articles as Hamm Rufe , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night he caught the freight out of Franklin , forever a slacker and yellow coward to the Hammondsand all the capital city . More and more his inability to identify himself actively with his fellow man , to be anything but an outside observer , irked the energetic , vital , partisan Stephani . Yet between times she tried to excuse him to them both . " Maybe we all have to see somebody we love smashed down and killed before we can get mad enough to do anything , " she said once . When you see that , you will fight too , my beloved . And perhaps it will not be too late . " Sometimes he thought he felt a community of interest , a brotherhood with his fellows , even an identification with their struggles . But since he came back to Franklin he went through the old files of George Rufer 's World and saw the differencep120between the men who built the capital city and their grandsons , as different as the liberal , fighting World of the seventies and eighties was from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the editorial his grandfather wrote after the Haymarket massacre , when the courts , unable to find the bomb thrower , and compelled to condemn someone to death , sent seven unquestionably innocent men to execution . " If agitating for a decent standard of living in this glorious land of the free is treason then let us all ready ourselves for the firing squad  --  and it is well that Washington and Franklin and Lincoln are safely buried , " he roared out in his paper and on the street , too , and in the town 's smoky checker parlor . But already the Franklin that George Rufer had founded , and that was " to envision and disseminate the highest attributesof cultural living to all the state , " was turning to lawless force . The night after his editorial appeared , the windows of his office were broken , his desk spattered with rotten eggs , the shop upset by toughs from down in the lumberyard and warehouse district , ordered to a task made much pleasanterby the gift of a brown-topped jug of whiskey . Hamm could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got so he never walked into a group of businessmen that the words did n't die out . Either they were givinghim hell , or talking of some crooked deal they hoped to keep from him and his newspaper . Once Hamm tried to tell Stephani of this grandfather , along towards the last , when the impatience with him had already grown heavy within her . Must America then go down to destruction , she demanded , while those who should be saving her spent all their time turningtheir eyes from the unpleasant realities of the present back to the courage and the bravery of their pioneer ancestors ? After the Oklahoma food riots Hamm had come northwardthrough Kansas and Nebraska and Minnesota to reportp121the Farm Holiday Association activities . He ran from train to bus , and plowed muddy side roads in topless Model T 's , , perhaps to see a gaunt old man behind barbed-wire entanglementsholding off the law with a squirrel gun or to watch the protesters of a forced farm sale scatter before tear gas , the water streaming from their eyes not all from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressed farmers in one trans-Mississippi state after another , and finally in Kanewa , too . They were lucky here with Eli Jiles 's old park a free camping place . Safe , for a while , behind the sign advertisingHerb 's Addition , they rested and looked down upon the new Hammond building , the finest in the city , and the scaffolding already standing where a capitol tower , straight and tall , was to rise within the year . And when the marchers scattered , to what spring plowing they would get to do , Hamm Rufe remained behind to write a special series on the farm rebellion , he told himself , for here he was free to stay as long as he liked , here where he knew something of the background , something of the capital city and its domination of the state . But the first few days in Franklin he had found himself searching the crowds for someone who might be Hallie Rufer Hammond . As he should have suspected , na one of Blue Ridge exposed himself to so depressing a sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so the evening before Hamm settled down to writing in Herb 's Addition he went up past his mother 's home . The slim , bare poplars along the back were much taller , two of them gone , and the blue spruce he liked so well and space for the flower beds on the front lawn too . Everything else was the same as when he left , that early spring evening . Finally he saw his mother come out to her coupe , a fine greyhairedwoman in smart blue tweed . Turning the scarred side of his face towards her , he passed along the walk , not three feet away . She looked up at his step , and he thought he caught a start of pity for the horrible , clumsy disfigurement.  | But there was nothing more , and he knew that he was safe , and that sixteen years under a scar and a threadbare coat are a long time . So Hamm Rufe stayed in Franklin , partly because without Stephani the struggle of the underdog seemed so empty of hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a mortgage moratorium , pretending a magnanimous humanity to cover up their defeat by the organizingfarmers . That meant his farm reporting was done , with no Stephani to furnish initiative and the courage for a new venture . Of course he could have written up the swift mortality among the banks , full of farm paper all suddenly frozen , and closing like village doors slamming before a rising storm . But even now those months of complete paralysis of the intellect , of the initiative and the vaunted ingenuity of the American , were appalling to look back upon , a glance through the papers of early 1933 , with their mass panic and their helplessness still frightening . By the time of Roosevelt 's dramatic inauguration Hamm was settled in the shack vacated by the jobless little teacher who found the ridge plank really high enough to keep her feet off the floor the night she tried to hang herself . Hamm still heard from Stephani every week or so . For a while she operated a relief kitchen in Harlan County , had her food truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gradually her letters began to speak of a dynamic organizer from the dark , the depressed regions of England . When he spoke to the American miners in the light of a lantern swinging from a tree he filled their empty stomachs , not with food but with daring . When he said " Grab a rock ! " the rocks became weapons equal to the rifles of the company deputies and the militia . Later Hamm heard again . They were up in Williamson among the marching strikers , twenty-five thousand , it was said , who were met by carloads of deputiesp123armed with riot and machine guns . Buckshot was fired pointblankinto them as they fell upon their faces . The militia ordered even the mayor of the city off the street . Stephani stayed with the dead and wounded and was jailed . From there they went into steel , the workers unorganized and starving , ready enough for unionization , now that their jobs were gone , Stephani wrote . Perhaps that was why Hamm took the little half-time bookkeepingand publicity job at the quiet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only new thing that had come into the capital city of Kanewa since the NonPartisanleague organizers were jailed here , over fifteen years ago . But he had not escaped the conflicts , the violences of life , for in the hospital was a man with a strikebreaker 's bullet in his shoulder , too infected for operation , and under the door of his shack appeared the first issue of the Christian Challenger , a mimeographed sheet of denunciation , with the hysteriaand the poison of the old Menace , but it was Jews and Reds this time who were the antichrists instead of the Catholics , and among them Hamm found his name and Carl Halzer's.  |p124FALL  ripened swift towards October , the days rich and warm and blue , with silken cobwebs floating and the smell of frostburntleaves . From the capitol tower the city was a blur of soft , yellowing mounds that were autumn maple and elm and ash and walnut . Only the oaks about the steeple of TrinityChurch , where Blue Ridge worshiped Easter morning and on Thanksgivings , were still dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week of rain had hesitated to approach . Beyond the city the fall-bred covering of weeds on the bare spots was browned by the frost , the cornstalks greyed by the rain , but between them long fields stretched dark as spring with new plowing . Most of the Franklinites were glad to see September go . It had started so well , with the finest of Kanewa weather for the coronation night that ended in the death of Cobby Welles . Since then there had been little reason for joy , except by the Safety Council and the road patrol . Serious highway accidents in the capital city region had dropped well below the fiveyearaverage . Franklin was celebrating its seventy-eighth consecutiveday free from automobile fatality , with only three more days to go to top the nation for the year in its class . Already congratulatory editorials were set in type , waiting . But they went into the hell-box , for the night of the first junior high party at Longfellow School two boys were killed by a hit-and-run driver . Hamm heard the first announcement over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spalding . In fivep125minutes there was more . The dead were the capital city 's two refugee children , the Spanish boy , Jose , of Dr. Russ Snell 's family , and the twelve-year-old Isaac from Germany , with the Professor Walfords . Hamm knew their stories of lone survival in the midst of violence , only to come here to die in the security of a midwestern capital town . He knew from Ona Snell that the boys were seldom in the street , perhaps because of the tauntings of the rest :  --  Ikey , kikeyKill a Christy  --  Drink a baby 's blood ! andRed ! Red ! A dirty Red ! P-p-p your pants An ' s-s-s your bed  --  the boys and even some of the girls saying the words right out if no teacher was near . It had happened more often when they first came , among the younger children , although lately those who had Klansmen or Gold Shirts in the family got worse . But perhaps what really stood between the boys and others of their age were the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the life of this new America seem a little childish to them , a sort of game to be played even with the grown-ups , and one that must inevitably end in the restorationof grim reality . The boys had been a problem to their teachers  --  especially Jose , the Spanish boy , called Whitey because of the blond hair that fell over his dark skin and somber eyes . In Current Events especially he was always jumping up , crying passionately , " They lie ! " at this or that account . But otherwise he was an exceptional student , on the school paper and already , after only two years in America , writing English well enough to get a sketch called " From My Childhood " printed in the university 's literary magazine , speaking of his first nine years as though they were a whole generation away . Isaac was dark-thatched , with fine , sensitive hands for the violin in the school orchestra . His lips were sensitive too , quiveringeasily , and then firming as though an inner maturity had suddenly asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people on the pavements , had watched his father come creeping home , a hand over the hole in his pants where his own war bayonet from the office wall went through , thrust deep by a brown shirter . So he came , the blood streaking the walk , and collapsed on the sill . Two days later they found Isaac sitting against the door , guarding the dead and swelling body of his father . His mother , at the market that same horribleday , was never heard from again . There had been considerable letter writing to the papers when the boys came to the capital city , more over Ikey than Jose , perhaps because Isaac was Jewish and because Till Walford , on the university staff , was more vulnerable . " Flooding the country with undesirable aliens and taking the bread out of the mouths of white men ! " they said , and " Bringing in Reds and Jews to cut the throats of our sons and rape our daughters ! " There was a long defense of the boys , with quotations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Whitman , ending : " Lift your eyes to the pure and noble pinnacle that stands unsullied above you , and recall that the globe that surmounts it rests equally upon the shoulders of all the peoples of the earth . " Many thought they recognized the style of Dr. Steele , head of the English department , but with half his faculty plottingfor his job , his defense of any underdog in Franklin had better remain anonymous . Then there was the trouble about a month ago , when a speaker came through looking for homes for refugee children . The woman was given written warning to leave townp127by both the Gold Shirts and a rising organization among the jobless youth called the Christian Crusaders . She talked , but frankly said she could not recommend Franklin as a fitting home for children to her board . The papers commented particularlyupon her straight hair and what they called her ungracious manner . Fortunately Jose and Ikey were settled before the Gold Shirts became so arrogant and although the boys were always drawn closer to each other than to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecutions that so easily become habitual . Tonight they had a good time at the school party and were hurrying out to Dr. Snell , who waited to take them home . As they ran across the street , arms about each other 's necks , a car shot through the stop button , upon them . A hundred of their classmates coming down the steps cried out in warning , rushed forward in an avalanche to where the boys lay , like rag figures thrown by the vanishing car . Russ Snell saw it happen but by the time he could reach them little Ikey 's face was already staring blankly into the dark sky . Jose was alive and moaned softly as the doctor straightened the twisted little body . He died in the ambulance , his fingers tight upon the hand of his American mother . The World gave the boys a six-column streamer and headed its lead editorial FATED TO A VIOLENT DEATH , making of the hit-and-run car an engine of destiny . In the last paragraphthere was a hint of complaint against the rumors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people thought they recognized the car . Red convertibles were made by the thousand , and although there was only one licensed in Franklin , no one was certain of the number . It might be from outside , even another state . The police were competent to carry on any investigation required . That part was read and reread in the pool halls , the garages , and on street corners . Investigation ? Then why were n't they detecting the death carp128like in the magazines , by scratched fenders , particles of hair or clothing clinging to it , or bits of paint on the victims ? " Hell , everybody knows who owns that red convertible , " others said . " And ai n't nothing going to be done about it . The police , they got their orders . " The funeral of the two little refugees was the largest ever seen in the capital city , larger than the public memorial for the first Franklin boy killed in action in the World War . Even high-up Gold Shirts like Joe Willper , said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To kill the talk , " it was whispered , for by then people were openly saying that Frankie Doover , son of Glen of the Franklin Mills , owned the red car . He was away , left for California the day before the funeral , driving his aunt out . There was talk , too , that he was to be promoted at Stone House , but maybe that was just villagey gossip . The services were serious and impressive , with the Lutheran minister of the Walfords officiating . " Two innocent children came here among us , " he said , " fleeing a vengeance they did not arouse and could not appease ; they were greeted with the cry of Red ! ' and Jew ! ' ; shamed in the schools and in the public press . May our great city sleep in peace and in safety tonight , now that they are gone . " Hamm stopped in at the Snells ' for a minute that evening . It was a stricken home , empty without the bright hair of the studious Jose bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried for the boy almost constantly . " You find him , please go find him , " she begged of Hamm as she crept into his lap . With her face buried in the crook of his arm she quieted a little , but even in her sleep she sobbed : " Hosey , Hosey  --  " To some of the Franklinites there were more important things than car accidents to little foreigners . Several of the outstate operatives , from places like Benway and Stoddard ,  |p129were  signing the Twelve State agreement with the striking truckers . Much of the over-the-road traffic was being rerouted to avoid both Grandapolis and the capital city , where there was bound to be trouble on the highways between the hired gunmen and the pickets . The Lew Lewis affair was too much for the outstaters  --  a fine varsity center like that , AllAmerican , and a damn nice fellow . The Franklin chamber of commerce objected to what they termed the boycott but the operatives had the arguments of shorter mileage and less road congestion on their side . So another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saving this last business . There was no optimism left among the wives of the strikers , with winter coming on and relief cut off weeks ago . Of course there was a little help from the union but with the men to defend in court , and hospital bills , too , it did n't go far . The children were n't so hungry any more , not crying much , just dragging around . Then there was the terrible accident out beyond Weld City , four of five people killed in a car as a big truck lurched out of the dark on a curve and threw them over the steel fence into a deep canyon . The trucker was accused of sleeping at the wheel and he admitted that he must have , but he had been driving sixteen hours steady and two-thirty in the morningwas a damn treacherous time for a tired man . When the officers tried to break down his story he got proof enough from stations along the way , Franklin , Walden , Carstairs , Minerva , and back as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man alone could n't drive more than twelve hours at the wheel of a commercial truck , the officers told him . It was against the law . " Whose law ? " the trucker asked . Not no law that 'll feed my wife and kids when the boss says go and I do n't go  --  " So he was held for manslaughter and the next noon a pretty girl walked up and down Philadelphia Avenue in a sandwich board.  | Your LIFE is in the hands of one doctorand in the hands of every TRUCKERon the highways . Help him keep it SAFE bygiving him a decentWAGEfor decent HOURSIt was Lew 's Nora , happy with the first good news from the hospital . All the smaller people of the capital city stopped to look back at her passing , feeling it was almost like New York , seeing such a thing on their own streets . A mighty pretty girl too , with maybe some sense to the stuff on that board . J. B. Groves did n't think so . He rushed into a drugstore and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he called it , for permitting the outrage . But it seemed there was no ordinance covering the case , and it being a woman , maybe they 'd just be making a martyr out of her , instead of a joke , like now . " Joke , hell ! " roared J. B. , and got in touch with the mayor . The old roosters along the American Bank wall enjoyed the girl 's passing . " I be damned , " said the Coot , spitting , but it was n't the pretty legs he was noticing this time , just the sandwich board , that he had seen Hamm and Dillard strap together the night before . In addition to the truck troubles , particularly the treason of the outstate operatives , there was the death of Colonel Frank Edwards , head of the Trans-Mississippi Life , just dropped on the street , and the week-long rain with a cloudburstfall opening night to depress the business men of Franklin . Instead of ten thousand potential customers passing everyp131window , the whole avenue was a grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand . Even old Hayden , who had lived dry in a cave off the First Street sewer since back in Coolidge prosperity , was flooded out . And when the sky finally cleared , the morning brought a frost that cooked the gardens like live steam , the first killing frost in September since the World War . Now La Belle Rose , Charley Stetbettor 's astrologer , came forward to say that she had predicted a bad September for Franklin way back in August , the supposed prophecies appearing in the evening paper in an inky half-page ad marked " Paid for by the Friends of Good Government , " no individualsnamed . Although only old Charley seemed to recall these predictions , they made good talking , these calamities she had foreseen , including even the Red labor disturbances and the killing frost . For October she promised that men would become wiser , see the wickedness in high places , and prepare to vote for a man born under Aries to leadership . " Yeh , vote themselves into the little Hitler fists of old Charley Stet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told each other over their beer down at Horsemeat 's . Even if that La Belle had really predicted a September swing far away from the officeholders no old politicians would have been impressed . " It do n't take no stargazing to see every incumbent 's licked in September , " they said , " but it 's October that tells the story . And election day . " Many Franklinites , publicly pretending amusement , were privately doing what they could to scratch together the ten dollars for a complete horoscope including the " Intimate Guide to Success in Love and Business , " as the fine-print footnote to the advertisement promised . The next evening the papers carried the professional cards of six other capital city astrologers , under pressure , because they had carried the one . When the Coot came by to look through Hamm 's paper he thumpedp132the page with his pipe . " A bunch of buzzards sure gather quick when they see one a gorgin ' himself  --  " " Yes , " Hamm agreed . " There 's something about insecurity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And particularly capital cities , " the Coot finished . " I bet they 're thick as roaches at the City Mission around Washington  --  " There obviously was a growing courage among the reactionariesof Franklin , perhaps because Senator Bullard had spent two days in the city delivering addresses at such varying places as a beer hall down in the Polish bottoms , Josina Black 's Norman living room , and the fieldhouse at the university . The newspapers had done a little predicting too , prophesyingthat no one would sign the petitions for Carl Halzer 's candidacy for the United States Senate , but although the petitions grew big as syrup buckets , almost no one would admit that his name was on them , until the World printed the whole lot , to encourage withdrawal . Even with his name on the ballot the Franklin papers ridiculed the new candidate , running pictures of the farmer-labor delegation that brought the petitions to the capitol , calling them " aliens and redneckedbums , like that scarfaced Ham from the clay banks . " That week the papers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some said they thought strikers were still citizens , even in Kanewa , and if it was the farmers who kept the state going that they were calling red-necked bums , it was getting to be too good a joke , since the money boys of the capital city had made bums out of so many farmers . Others wondered if the editors knew that " Scarfaced Ham " from the clay banks was a writer for several magazines , including the Nation ? The editor telephoned around and got several letters from good Franklin names , like Black , Welles , and Doover , to print with the less literate ones for Halzer . The one from Glen Doover was pulled after the first edition  --  stirred up too much talk about his son 's connection with the hit-and-run business . Editorially the papers tried to discuss the candidacy as a joke . The Bull of Bashan , like others of his kind , must have his season of bellowing , and then he would quietly return to his pasture , as the Bull had before . Then it got around that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halzer farm twice in one week , and a neighbor even told of seeing the girl out at the hog lot with Carl , looking at his Berkshires . It took some of the edge off the letter in the World by her brother , and made a good story for cocktails and tea . It got action , too , from the easy-going Billie Bamper , who ran a little sporting-goods store for the country-club trade , the university executives , and a few of the higher-ups at the capitol . Sometimes people wondered how he lived , and managed to keep his civic interests going , charteringplanes with Cobby Welles to follow the football team , putting in whole months of time out with Senator Bullard on campaign , and going with the Kanewa delegation to the meetings of the associated manufacturers . When Billie heard about Marylin 's car in the Halzer yard he rubbed the top of his pink head with his palm , pulled at his fat lip , and decided to drive out to Susan Welles . He found Marylin in the sunroom , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through back numbers of the Swinebreeder . Billie picked one up , pointed out Halzer 's name on the address slip . " Doing your fishing in mighty shallow water , do n't you think ? " he demanded . She handed the man a glass . " Have a drink and remember that you 're fishing clear out of your depth , Billie Bamper , trying that tone on me . Besides , maybe I 'm really interested in stock improvement . " " Then you better put it off till after election . " " How do you know I 'll be here then ? " she asked , without looking up from her magazine . Of course she could n't be meaning Washington , but there was no use putting ideas into women 's heads , so Billie hunted up Cassie , who had moved into another house and was fighting with the architects and with Cees Hammond and his decorator over the rebuilding of Welleshaven . Not that Billie expected to get anywhere much with her either . Somehow poor Cobby never did learn to manage his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run loose and raise hell for other people . " I 'm only Marylin 's mother , you know  --  " Cassie remindedBillie . " Anyway you 're not worried by a hog farmer . His leading the strikers Labor Day will defeat him with all right-thinking people  --  " Silver City was closed for the season , the stands boarded up , the swimming pool drained . The fairgrounds , too , were deserted , except the parking space for the weekly wrestling match . But the university was open ; five thousand students in town . There would be another seven , eight hundred as soon as the capital city got the agricultural college moved in from Benway , and more than that when they killed the four teachers ' colleges scattered over the state . While half the students plodded up and down looking for a little work , the rest were welcomed as guests , with special windows along Philadelphia Avenue featuring photographs of last year 's school celebrities : the honorary colonel of the R.O.T.C. in her white uniform with purple-faced cape ; the prom girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sleek-lined Buffalo goddess . The football team was used everywhere , from the twelve-foot photograph of the squad in Hammond'smain avenue window to the crumb cookie men iced in purple and gold in the bakeries of the Polish bottoms . Greek-letter motives were popular all through rush week ; even Samelly Finestein , the secondhand man , had a Sig plaque in his dusty window and would n't say who hocked it , certain there would be no broken glass to disturb this week . When Harold Welles and half a dozen of his fellow shirt wearersp135went down afterward it was gone , a hair wreath in its place , and a smile of welcome on Samelly 's face . " What can I do for you gentlemen today  --  ? " Every fall it was the same ; the ambitious , the impressionable , the idealistic youth of the state swarming into the capital city . Many were from the remotest homes and got their first glimpse of the magnificence of man from his handiwork on the campus , the fieldhouse , the huge grey football stadium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capitol building that overlooked all the city . If they made a frat , the local sponsor had them out to tea or a smoker on Blue Ridge , talked to them of his kind of success , of ways to get ahead in the world . By Christmas many could n't bear to go home . " Fat ticks down there is what makes thin sheep here , " a father out on Wild Horse Plains told his complaining son . But that did n't make the thin sheep any more attractive . If the student turned out to be exceptional at all he was soon headed away east ; if original at all he was driven out ; if studious , he went away on a fellowship to Harvard or Yale , or even Oxford , perhaps to an interneship in one of the large medical centers ; if ambitious , to bigger business opportunitiesor to the staff of corporation lawyers . Those who stayed in Franklin or had to return to their home communitiesdisseminated the ideals  --  economic , political , and cultural  --  of the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was always competition for the more likely freshmen , with illegal pre-rush groups gathering for midafternoon caking and cards in the dusky booths of the Buffalo coffee shop . Rush week was a milling of dinners , teas , and evening parties with high laughter and much gushy talk among the sisters , hardboiled big-shot blowing among the brothers  --  all to impress the confused rushees , usually away from home for the first time . Then suddenly one morning the newcomers awoke to find themselves pledges whose business it was to answer the door , the telephone , and fetch and carry for everyone  --  the new house slaves . If they were really too unprepossessing or not long enough on financial backing , they found themselves living in a dormitory or rooming house with the poor and the studious who came here to work . Mollie Tyndale had , of course , gone Kay Dee , with the newest , the finest house on the Row , its buttermilk-white front flood-lit , reminding Hamm Rufe of the Kress building on Fifth Avenue . It was n't paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable . But Mollie was never initiated . After a week of school she drove down past the Co-op . Burt saw her coming and slipped into the men 's toilet and so Hamm went out before the manager noticed . She had stopped by to sec how Lew Lewis was getting along , she said , but when Hamm started to tell her , she could n't keep up the pretense . " He 's here , is n't he ? " she whispered . The man nodded , wiping at her shining windshield . " Tell him , " she said finally , " tell Burt I 've got to go away . To England . " " England ? " Hamm asked , afraid for the boy . " Yes . " She started the engine , released the clutch . " Alone , " she said low , and slipped out of the driveway . At the hospital Lew Lewis was slowly pulling out of his long infection . He probably owed his life to the same stuff that had killed half a dozen young fellows trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoning , two , three years ago right around Franklin . The striker was pullingthrough , his big frame , once the fulcrum of the varsity line , bare as the scaffolding of a barn . But with her Lew eating again , the little waitress on the morning shift smiled on the truckers once more even with no investigation at all of the shooting , and with the anti-picketing law probably coming up before the state supreme court this week , and Lew stewingp137that he could n't be flag-bearer for the protest parade through the capitol  --  could n't even get himself to the can without a woman helping . He had other worries . Twice a sweet-mouthed , grey-haired little lady came in to sit with him . She never said who she was but he thought she 'd get around to the God business pretty soon . Instead , she led Lew to talk of himself and the trucking situation , gently prodding his resentment . to get him to name the company whose hired gunmen shot him . Finally he rang for the nurse , but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mimeographed Christian Challenger was thrown over the screen upon his bed , reporting his progress as a menace to the city . When Lew got well enough for visitors , the striking truckerscame trooping in , to stand awkwardly around the bed , whispering at first , and finally roaring their laughs right out loud , forgetting the three other patients in the room . But Lew could see they were worried . He got the story out of Nora when she came . There was talk of the national guards , more hired thugs , too , but on top of that the guards . He had to get out of here , he told Dr. Snell . Oh , sure , but how about the hospital bill ? Until it was paid he was in hock . That was the hell of it , Lew complained . The doctor did n't agree . He was eating , was n't he ? With Halzer a candidate , Hamm Rufe had to think over the state situation . Not that there was any chance of losing the big farmer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than merely jar the back teeth of the Capital City World and its Ridge customers . There were , of course , many stratifications in the city of sixty thousand between those who sat in the cool duskiness of Welleshaven before Cobby 's coffinand the squatters of Herb 's Addition . About two hundred families in Franklin were comfortably fixed , with good securityof business and , excluding the football coach at the uni- versity , the chancellor , and the governor of the state , with some security of job  --  the backbone of Hammond and Schendler customers . Below these were the twenty-five hundredor so who got along pretty well , but with no security of the future : the small business men , the upper half of the universitystaff , and the departmental executives of the capitol . About five thousand families were just managing , the breadwinnersubject to layoff any time , with no security of bed or breakfast . Any day these people might find themselves seriously answering civil service institute ads , trying to write for the confession magazines , wearing out the library dictionariesmaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with box tops , especially right after Franklin 's quota of prize money was doled out . Between these spurts of hope they would consider mushroom culture , chain letters , addressing envelopes at home , and finally doorto-doorpeddling . In the end they could try to join the two thousand eligible for government projects if the money was ever voted . Until then there was the six dollars a month direct relief , which would drop to four and perhaps three dollars when the seven thousand on the list climbed to twelve thousand in February , or more , if there was another WPA layoff or if the little tannery followed the other factories that shut down the last fifteen years : the broom , the glove , the overall and shirt factories , and the little packing house . Or they might join the two hundred or so , mostly lone men and women , who looked to the city dumps and the garbage cans as more generous and reliable than the county relief agency . Yes , there should be a healthy protest vote right here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was still better off than the rest of the state , or the usual industrial center . Through all the depressionthe state government expenditures in the capital city increasedmuch more than the fifteen percent cut of the univer/sky faculty or the reduction in student money . The **26;5710;TOOLONG of the statewide federal programs went into circulation here , and much of the eight million put into the capitol building since 1928 . In addition , the Kanewa branches of eastern investment companies were here , to be close to the legislature . " Just followin ' our money , " the dispossessed explained as they pulled into the capital city , forty-three families the last week in September , and more to come by cold weather , many more . With September done things did look up , the conservative candidates gaining ground , football spirit running high at bonfire rallies , with the stadium white-birds collecting an average of five bushels of empty bottles after each game . That meant a spending crowd , so far , at least . But the coach had better be whipping the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was literary news too , as the World called it . A book about the town 's own Frontier House was chosen for October distribution by one of the book clubs , giving the capital city some fine national publicity . " Abigail Allerton has told the very human story of a hotel with flavor and character , and , through it , the story of a city , a state and an era . A witty piece of writing , and profound too , " the paper quoted from the advance folders . They were well gotten up , with an etching of the old hotel as it looked in its good days , before the front balcony was pulled down , the grilling used to fence the Gilson lot at the cemetery . W. J. Bryan stood on the balcony , his long hair blowing , the flaring torches of a mid-ninety parade massed in the street below . The Wakoonian Internationals moved fast , almost as fast as the insurance agents and the reporters . Would Miss Allertonhonor them with her presence at a special dinner ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pretty local for all the optimism of their name , but not yet musclebound . It was well that they were n't . When the evening pink with Abigail 's picture and the announcement of the book 's acceptance was out , everybody seemed anxious to honor the new author . Billings , the manager of the old hotel , looked around the faded red plush of his lobby and planned to remodela bit , with a grand opening and the author as honor guest . There 'd be a revival in business sure now . He 'd take it up with the receivers tomorrow . A landmark , that 's what the Frontier was  --  a national landmark , and he 'd billboard it so for a hundred miles each way . That evening there were a dozen telegrams and special deliveries at Abigail 's door , and a box of flowers , purple and white chrysanthemums , from Hamm , with a note : " For the town 's new glammer gal . " There were strangers at the door , too , lone men , drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bag of oats on a passing truck . The next day the postman brought a bundle of mail clear up to Abigail 's door , ten times too much for the box . Among the lot were half a dozen manuscripts from Franklinites , people she had never heard of . They wanted her to correct them , to get them published  --  and keep the matter strictly confidential , please . Towards noon Cassie Welles called , with congratulations . She was so glad for Miss Allerton 's good fortune , and would she come to dinner that night ? The driver would pick her up at seven . When Abigail refused , saying she did n't go out much , Cassie got down to business . She had a young friend who wrote , not history books , like hers , but poetry , things that were beautiful . Abigail was pleased to know it . But he was having a little difficulty , Cassie went on . He was so adorably impractical . " I thought perhaps you might have your editor buy them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassie Welles and her group , the reservations piled up so they moved to the main dining room of the chamber , hired a string trio for five dollars , added two more speakers , and got radio time . They decided to send Abigail a corsage of orchids and a chauffeur to pick her up , and were disturbed and embarrassed by her unprepossessing appearance , straight boxed hair , and plain navy street dress , but they saw almost at once that it really magnified the generosity of their gesture . Abigail was uneasy . With the prepublication copies of the book out she had expected resentment , Franklin being what it was , and could see nothing beyond a little disappointment as she walked into the high plaster and gold room with long tables narrow as the double planks set up for threshers at home . The place seemed full of older women , some with artificial flowers on top of their heads , their shoulders bare with the indecent , plucked look of skin seldom exposed . Half a dozen professional book reviewers were set up close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you just see things , much better than reading the books , " Mrs. Beal 's group always said of her . Somehow she managed to get at least one slip with a writer 's autograph for each member of her group during the year . The bookstores objected to her particularly , for she had all their better charge customers . When the food came the chicken-fried steak was cold , but the ice cream had a chocolate center in the shape of a book , and the coffee was strong and plentiful , as men like it . While the speaker introduced Abigail he held a copy of the Anteroom in his hand for everyone to see , praising it fulsomely , using the publisher 's blurb as his own words , and heating Abigail 's uncomfortable ears to a steady , burning red . He told of this woman who had come in from one of the small outstate colleges to a history assistantship at the universityfor work on her doctorate : " The Inception , Growth and Culmination of the Movement for Popular Election of United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the difficult title as he read it from a card in his hand . The audience was undisturbed , laughing freely as he explained that from such a slow-freight title Miss Allerton had " elaborated " a book the publishers were calling Anteroomfor Kingmakers . The title left them a little doubtful , although it had appeared correctly in some of the newspaper stories . Several requests brought a repetition , followed by a dead silence . But the speaker , a pushing young attorney with political hopes and a charter membership in the Wakoonians , knew what to do  --  snow them under with words . " We have then with us tonight , " he said grandly , " a lady who has caught a vision of the glory and the romance of our fair city of Franklin as typified by the Frontier House . Studyingour immortal townsmen , our politicians and our statesmen , this lady has carved through their deeds and personalities an everlasting niche for herself as the recorder of their great service to the glory of our fair city and our great nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerableColonel Welles with his long flowing locks and his Prince Albert , United States senator and friend of Buffalo Bill ; Jacob Stoor ; Drygoods Mike Hammond , the farseeing builder of Hammond 's ; the handsome Joseph Colmar ; T. S. Shuler , long majority leader of the house , and so on "  --  apparently not to give any mention to the founder of the city , the old radical , thought Abigail . But the man was far beyond George Rufer , to " our distinguished junior senator , the Honorable John Bullard , who as a stripling learned sound politics at the feet of these statesmen . You will see Blaine , the Plumed Knight , address an enthusiastic rally from the old Frontier balcony , and from the same place McKinley turn our fair city back into the true path of sound Republicanism from which it has wavered only once since , and , God willing , shall never do so again ! " A full hour later the man was finally whipping his hoars/ened voice into a climax : " Here you will see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most gloriously American , when every man was still a free individual , and growing prosperity walked with her hand on every shoulder . Business grew big , land values skyrocketed , labor was free from disturbing outside influence to work or not , as it preferred ; and every man was free to climb the ladder of success without let or hindrance . As the biographer of the greatest period of American Individualism , I give you Dr. Abigail Allerton . " Abigail was struck dumb . She could barely rise and because there was nothing else to say , she told them they were most kind , and that she hoped they would not be too disappointed in her book . " Indeed , I think I can say without hesitation that we will not be disappointed . I think I am safe in saying that Franklin has added a lustrous star to the great literary names of all times and all nations ! " the young attorney generously replied for them . It was a long , long evening , and when Abigail finally escaped , she ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fine eyes . How could she have been so stupid , expose herself to such inanities ? Hamm Rufe was waiting in her apartment , the radio still on , a dance band blaring instead of the voice of the fulsome young Wakoonian . " Is the book really as putrid as they suggest ? " he asked . " I ca n't conceive your doing anything so bad . " He had beer and pretzels sent up and when Abigail had talked herself into a little calmness he got her to bring out her copy , let him read from it . There was a preface , and a short introductory chapter on the region , covering the fur-trader period , the Indian wars , with a cut of the old Harcoot trail station , the first place of lodging in the Franklin vicinity . The story of the hotel itself was headed with a line draw/ing of the first unit of Frontier House , built the year before Franklin wangled the capitol from Grandapolis . Almost immediately , Abigail showed , the hotel became the rallying place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early city , with a fringe of smaller real-estate boosters and outstate politicians who wanted the capital away from the entrenched Grandapolis crowd . For fifty years after they succeeded the legislative caucuses were called at Frontier House , and much of the legislation formalized in the capitol was arranged in the hotel bedrooms over cigar butts and whiskey bottles . Here all the major sell-outs of Kanewa prior to the period of utility expansion took place . In those days the powers of the state were the two main railroads , in a perennial struggle for control of the state supreme court , later the railway commission and always to name the legislativelyappointed United States senators , for it was in Washington , then as now , that the big killings were made . When appointment time came around the railroads set up rival headquarters at the Frontier Hotel , a floor apiece , and ribald stories were still told of the outstate legislators who wandered into the wrong camp for their entertainment and stipend . Not that the big-town lawmakers were more honest , as George Rufer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , since they were usually full-time railroad tools . Gradually the practice of milking both sides became so common that the president of the C. G. &; W. moved his headquarters over into the governor 's office in the capitol , away from bad influence . To this President Herrald of the North Line replied by roaring that an honest legislator , like an honest senator , was one who stayed bought . The stench over the railroad 's actual footprints in the governor 's office got the incumbent impeached and once more the Frontier housed both sides . This time the back stairs were blocked and the boys running the newly installed elevators memorizedp145the names of each floor 's consignment , as the legislators were called . The entertainment at the Frontier during session time was always lavish and lusty , with a guest bar , a resident gambler , and plenty of women . When the time came for a senate appointmenteach railroad brought in a special host , Judge or Colonel somebody or other , with a florid face , a Prince Albert , and a hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backer 's floor for the key legislators . They drank what they wanted for a starter and received a pictorial booklet of the railroad that they always tucked carefully into an inside pocket , for between the pages somewhere was a bill , sometimes as high as five hundred dollars , and once it was a round thousand . Then the guests were eased into the gambling rooms , where importedbig-time card sharpers worked for a two-way cut with the railroad , the hotel getting either half of each gambler 's take or a full third of the total . For those so inclinedthere were good friends of the Judge or the Colonel , girls from Omaha , or Kansas City , Des Moines or St. Louis . Few of the men refused to play , none squawked when the easy money was gone . The Frontier 's take , even with the crookedest gamblers , was usually five to fifteen thousand dollars a night like this , and of course the hotel paid no freight charges all the fifty years . " Greatest period of American Individualism ! " Hamm snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , perhaps because of the beer . Several trials of midwestern railroad senators for bribery hastened the shift to popular election , the final chapter pointed out . Then the Franklin House was built up the avenue beyond the noisy business zone , and later the Buffalo Hotel , up-to-date , and within four blocks of the statehouse . The empty red plush of the Frontier began to fade and by the time lobbyists were legalized , they registered elsewhere.  |p146But  even before the town went dry in 1914 salesmen were planning their route sheets with only daytime stops in Franklin . Too damn many women wearing high collars , even for a capital city , one complained to his boss . Long ago the old Frontier became a stopping place for those of small expense accounts , and teachers and Sunday School groups . There was a register of regular guests , too , older men and women living on annuities , or pensions , a retired petty politician or two , an ex-preacher , and always about thirty widows . There were still plenty of set-ups ordered football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was usually limited to a mouse behind a dresser , a stray Saturday-night drunk in the halls , or the roaring of the third-rate wrestler who had to have hot milk toast and absolute silence as soon as he came in . Hamm Rufe was pleased with the book , amazed to see so much that he vaguely knew brought to such reality by an outsider . Abigail had made a sound protagonist of the hotel and its three main employees : Boswell Dillings , the manager with the glass eye , called Crock behind his back ; Spider , the wiry little pastry cook whose fingers were as clumsily deft with a deck of cards as with the icing bag ; and Mrs. Miller , the housekeeper , named Dewlaps by a cowman from out on Wild Horse Plains . Dew did n't mind , for she had never seen a cow from close and thought it meant something fresh and morning-sweet . She also thought every young woman stranded at the hotel an innocent maiden betrayed . Not even succoring the girl from Daisy Dee 's , planted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the hotel ran the change that had come upon the town and the state , the change from the open and direct bribery of a legislature through a little good whiskey , a few thousand dollars , and a set of bedmates to the vast and usually indirect and unrecognized business itp147had become today . Now there were millions at the command of representatives of eastern interests for the purchase of crucial newspapers , for free propaganda to the press , the schools , and the churches , and for outright bribery , when this crudity was necessary . And there were always highsalariedjobs for any young men smart enough to become dangerous ; entertainment , flattery , new cars and further advantages , so-called , for anyone in a strategic position . " Enter our mysterious Grandapolis party giver , Cole Dringer , " Hamm said . Yes , Cole Dringer and all his poor dupes in Kanewa , in Franklin particularly , with the responsibility of the capital upon them , living off the state and selling it out , selling out their fellow men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old independents like George Rufer had become so dubious of their ability to stand alone that they would reach out for any dangling liana that could only bring them down . Worse , perhaps they were not great trees with errant branches at all but only poor little roadside weeds swaying towards the dodder that would suck their blood and move over them to the next . To this Hamm had nothing at all to say and as the three o'clock streamliner , the President Coolidge , was whistling in , he left . Outside , leaning against the wall , was a very sleepy young man with an autograph book . " You 're my first author , " he confided to Abigail Allerton . Early the next morning a professor 's wife called . She was to review the Anteroom for the Faculty Club on publication day , and no copies were available . She would consider a loan a great favor . But the book was back before breakfast the next day , without an explanation or a thank you , and at the review the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took the liberty to change to Sun on the Window Sill as more appropriate . When the other  --  the other thing has been read you will understand . " The book was on sale an hour when the landlady came lumbering up to Abigail 's apartment . " It 's a lady by my telephone , a very mat lady . She say you do not answer when she ring you  --  " The next few days there were dozens of mad people , with threats of libel , and of direct bodily violence , like , say , a fist in the snoot . There were angry denunciations in the papers that had been so immoderate with praise less than a week ago , and loud demands that Abigail be asked to resign her job at the university . People fell away before her on the street , even old acquaintances , and then sought her out privately to get at an enemy through further exposures . They could really give her the inside dirt , the real stuff  --  Some of the people who called hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling what that woman might dig into next . When it was discoveredshe had been looking through the records of the Benway bank robbery , Johnson Black , nephew of Josina , and the town 's perennial bachelor , offered himself as a public sacrifice by asking her to take his good , sound capital city name . He got pretty abusive when she said she would n't care to , but quieted down fast enough when she asked him about the paresis in his family . Yes , he admitted , his father died of it , in a sanitarium in Switzerland . Abigail was ashamed now , sorry for the man as he went slowly down the stairs , his hat in his hands . Of course , he did n't have sense enough to keep it , told it in purpling anger around the city club . It went through the town like water poured on gravel , particularly through the second-best people , and on lower . But even some of those most pleased at this take-down for a Black could n't forgive such talk in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor-relation cousin of Josina Black who got into Hattie Krasinski 's apartment for a folded bill . Since nothing came of the one kiss she had from Cobby Welles she seemed to have turned against men , and anyone contaminated . She liked movies of the Girl of the Limberlost type , read Freckles and tried Black Oxen too , but decided it was slow . Instead she hunted up a woman doctor who might know about the transplantations . Yes , the doctor knew of the various Steinachs , but she suggested that nature be left alone . Della finally gave up taking casual acquaintances to strange towns after a girl called the house detective to get her out of the woman 's room . While the story was kept from the papers it made fine talk over the bridge tables when contract was losing its edge . It was Della who denounced the Monastery , the old rooming house full of men , an ex-convict , a renegade priest , and a dozen others , including several university students . The place was raided at her insistence but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen young fellows to the station just because they wore silk panties . So they turned the lot loose , without any publicity , but a woman picked up for soliciting on the post-office steps told the story around among her customers . " I tells ' em , Boys , you ought a go to Kansas City . That 's the market for lemon suckers . ' " The last few years Della was stalking out of moving pictures , snooping over news stands and through the stacks at the city and the university libraries , copying out passages to take up with the right people . As soon as she got around to the Anteroom she hurried with her page of excerpts to the mayor . But he was having trouble enough with a co-operative packing house that somehow got a building permit , three traffic deaths at the First Street crossing , and , of course , the strike . So Della made the rounds of the town , even to her relatives , who did what they could to keep her out of their affairs . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices came in Friday there was scarcely a one that failed to list a Sunday sermon against Abigail  --  one opportunity for contemporary comment that would enrage no organized group . Several of the sermons were listed by the book 's name ; one was on " Realism versus Godliness in Current Books , " and one on " The Viper in Our Bosom . " With these went a lead editorial in the Sunday World headed :  --  RENEGADE FOLLOWERS OF IDA TARBELLrecalling that at the turn of the century there was a muckrakingwoman loose in America , a certain Ida Tarbell . But the successful business ventures that she attacked were so solidly conceived and grounded in the American Way that they were today stronger than ever , while who remembered Ida Tarbell ? " So will it be with the recent scurrilous attack upon the fair name of our capital city and the people who built her greatness . " Hamm Rufe was ashamed . This was the same paper in which his grandfather once wrote so eloquent a defense of the expose of the Standard Oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added a review of Miss Tarbell 's autobiography , and sent it to the editor , wishing he might sign it Rufer Hammond , part owner of the Capital City World . That would put maggots into the man 's belly , as the Coot would say . There was no acknowledgment , but the paper got together a long symposium made up of local opinions of the book , some of the authorities quoted frankly admitting that they had not seen it but knew the contents . Only the head of American history at the university and the local Y.W.C.A. secretary were for the author . The professor said he had read the book in manuscript . All the material was from Miss Aller/ton 's published dissertation , completely documented and available at the library to anyone . There was more the author might have told . But the man was reminded that he had a good position for these times and a big family to keep . After a trip to the chancellor 's office he made another public statement . The Allerton book , upon second reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper to the specializeduse of the historian was not necessarily proper for public consumption . Dora Stilwell , from the Y , stood fast . Sidestepping unpleasantfacts never remedied them . Miss Allerton 's book was on the whole well-written and completely convincing , as the storm of protests should indicate . It also seemed , Miss Stilwell said , after her ten years of residence in the capital city , exceptionally moderate in tone . That got her name into the Christian Challenger as a Red , and when it was called to her attention she was undisturbed . Oh , the Y 's were often labeled Red . She , herself , was more frequently accused of anarchism . Dr. Snell and Till Walford wanted to enter the fight but Hamm and Abigail talked them out of it . Why sacrifice themselves for a victory that time would win if it was worth the winning ? For two weeks the witch-burning went merrily on . Here and there a woman pitied the writer her plainness , but seeing so many men turn to look after her on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unFranklinish jauntiness , the women hated her more than they pitied . By this time the university was involved far beyond the history department . Two men who had lost their powerful positions in the purchasing department after the old chancellordied , for commission taking , came forward to charge the present administration with encouraging subversive activities and all-around laxness  --  Abigail Allerton and her book , based on a doctorate , their Exhibit A. Senator Bullard joinedp152their demand for a legislative investigation , and Charley Stet came to town to thunder against the immorality of the studentsand " the devilish plans of the International Jew bankers and Jew Reds , aided and abetted by the Scarlet Woman of the campus ! " By this time Hallie Rufer Hammond got around to readingthe book and wrote Abigail a long letter . She must apologize for the stupidity of her townsmen and say how sorry she was that her father , George Rufer , could not have lived to see the fine job Miss Allerton had made of the old Frontier House story . She was right to quote him , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things in the Anteroom . Abigail thanked her , saying she was pleased that the capital city 's most vigorous founder left something of his strength and courage behind . That night Hamm was in , laughing a little over the letters about the book with Abigail . When he came across the Hammond one with the carbon of the reply attached , Abigail noticed that his face sobered , bleakened like the clay slope above his shack , especially when he came to the end : " For the good of the history department , I am resigning my position  --  " He stood up , letting all the letters in his lap slip to the floor , and without even a good-bye escaped to the street , leavingAbigail to look after him in concern.  |p153Fox  two days , ever since he saw that the town had driven Abigail to resign her position with the university , Hamm Rufe sat hard and bitter as an osage orange within himself . At work or on his chilling stoop in the evening it was the same , and one after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coot stayed . He wanted to talk about the city 's protestations against Anteroom for Kingmakers . " Ai n't that just like a hysterical old chippie  --  flying into a tear just because somebody 's dug up a chunk of her past ? " he asked several times , so finally Hamm had to reply , Well , if the capital city really was a chippie , would the advertisementof her past whip up a failing business for her too ? The Coot nodded , pulling his pipe out of his beard to spit . Yeh , it seemed to , down to the city library , anyhow . Hamm knew about that . They told Abigail that if the reserves for the Anteroom kept accumulating , they ought to double the record set by The President 's Daughter , years ago , and so far the all-time high for capital city reading . But suddenly Franklin was faced with a scandal not so conveniently in the past as the purple days of the old Frontier House , and much more disturbing to outstate parents of girls at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the paper . The whole thing was started by a small item about a studentfrom Walden who died in a local hospital , " after a brief illness . " Such death notices were common enough in Franklin , but the girl 's fiance was the nephew of Dr. Luden of Zena , who had moved out of the capital city after fighting ten years for a liberalized attitude towards sex education and the establishment of a birth-control clinic , even if it had to masquerade as a maternity center . One evening in late September the boy came running blindly across lawns and flower beds to his uncle , the paper with the little item held out before him . It was Nellie , his Nellie . She had been acting queer the last month or so , sent his movie camera back and would n't even let him go down to take her to Franklin to school . Then the letter he mailed to the dormitory where she stayed last year came back , marked " Not here . " The doctor drove straight to the capital city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days later the story of an abortion mill in Franklin broke in a streamer across the Grandapolis pinks , with a picture of Eddie Chimmer , former vacuum-cleaner salesman , who called himself Doctor of Electro-Adjustication , and several of his office and consultationrooms taken from peepholes in the ceiling . Two officers had watched the place at night , saw fifteen women receive treatment and almost as many go away because they did n't have the fifty-dollar fee . Eddie Chimmer was a gaunt , stoopshoulderedman , with a sloping forehead and deep eye sockets that he fancied resembled Lincoln 's . " Like the great Emancipator  --  " he told the reporters . But his mouth was a thin inverted U and his receding chin disappeared into a loose fold of skin like a lizard 's . There was a picture of a book , too , that the doctor , a native of the city and an autograph collector on the side , required his patients to sign . Of course the women used fictitious names but in the back , by key number , he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , he did after the place was empty , sometimes pretty late , for business was best when the alley door to the stairs was in thick darkness . With the office finally locked Eddie sat at his old desk ,  |p155his  thin back bent over the book , his bony fingers creeping through the pages that held some of the best names of the town . Finally he locked it away in his old safe and went out to his supper at a chili joint near by , where nobody ever seemed to take the stool next to him . At the first smell of the story the Franklin business men scurried around to kill it , but with the Grandapolis Inquirer scattering the details over the state like goatsbeard seed on the wind , they had to let the local papers use it too , toned down , of course , implying doubt of the practitioner 's guilt , and hinting at personal animosity on the part of unnamed individuals  --  perhaps certain outstate physicians whose patientswere coming in for electric adjustments . " I got enemies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner said in the World . Right to the last the capital city officials tried to stop the autopsy of the dead girl . Why break the mother 's heart ? they asked , not saying anything about implicating the doctor who signed the death warrant . But by this time both the father and mother of the girl were in town , demanding a complete investigation , their determination strong . In the city 's loud indignation Abigail and her book were forgotten . " Such things going on , and right among our own young people ! " Then , remembering the source of much of the city 's income , added , " And all those lovely young girls at the university , scarcely more than children , and far away from their mothers  --  " Naturally the case would drag on forever , but in the meantimestories got around , stories about the hundreds of entries in the back of the brown autograph book . Mostly the names were common enough : young married women of the town 's working people , and waitresses , clerks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting for , of course , the men were not listed , although some of the best names were suspected . Those who wondered if Cobby 's Hattie was on the list got snickers . There was no evidence that she had been exposed to what could be called fire , not with Marylin born too soon to be a Welles , and Harold blamed on that fake Canadian war hero  --  not unless little Hattie had been steppingout on her Cobby . Anyway , was n't there some sort of saying about specialists for the mistress , the family doctor for the wife , and the quack for the party girl ? Not that Eddie Chimmer was n't a specialist , in his way . And he did get some good names , mostly girls who were afraid of their mothers , and women who thought they were fooling their husbands and the family doctor . Even this year 's empress was mentioned , her name almost the last in the book . After that got around there was a great deal of neck-stretching over the booth walls at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look peaked , did n't everybody think ? they asked each other . Yes , gaunt as a new mother cat . Not that anything Franklin said mattered much to Helen Groves . Next week she would be away east to college , with photographs to prove she was the empress of Kanewa . Besides , her father had considerable money in American Electric . So she strode , long-legged and confident , among the booths , greeting her acquaintances with her usual little gasps of delight . Lew Lewis was better , putting a little meat back on his bones , anxious to get out , with trucks upset every night or so at the county line , and a striker 's head grooved by a bullet . Then there was the supreme court decision , so long overdue  --  He just had to get home . The last trip out to the hospital Hamm took the bus around by way of Welleshaven for a look . Cassie had the curb solid with cars , the house lit up bright , working double shift , evidently . Half the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second story cut back , probably putting in onep157of those deck things everybody wanted just now . Probably with grillwork , too , like around the grounds , painted white as valentine lace , with lavender or baby-blue shutters . Hamm knew that Cassie and Dachel were established down at the old Culbert place , Harold probably lounging around the Sig house most of the time , although he was n't going to classes this semester , too many incompletes , Burt said . There were rumors that Dachel 's lack of interest in Gold Shirt activities set hard as gr. ' en apples with the son . At least he 'd been talking pretty free around the Siggery about that scheming , self-loving bastard sucking around his mother . It seemed strange to Hamm that he and Cobby used to loaf around the same fraternity , up in the old Black dwelling , then , of honest Harcoot brick , with a round tower and high stained-glass windows . Now the Siggery was a big grey stone rectangle on the Row , with side panels of glass brick and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the frat way back in their high school days , already against the rules  --  Cobby smoking and drinking with the peg-top pants and coonskin coaters , Hamm arguing politics with the cellar gang , where the ideas seemed to have settled . Cassie Welles made her first really public appearance since Cobby 's death by taking her poet to the Kanewa Authors ' Club . Dachel made a fine showing , slim and handsome in his new leaf-brown suit and sand-colored shirt , his tie the mottled hazel green his eyes were in the sun . When he was introduced among the guests , he acted modest , had nothing much to say , and so gave everyone the impression that he was probably a great poet , as well as quite a lover . Sensitive too , Cassie Welles whispered to those about her , for while he wrote sheafs and sheafs of poetry , he could n't bear to expose it to the eyes of strangers , not even to editors . Dachel seemed not to be listening , or to notice all the older women turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and patted his pretty lips with his napkin.  | Hamm watched them from a side table where he had taken Ona Snell , who preferred the less conspicuous place herself because the staring over little Jose 's death was not yet done . She could understand something of the man 's need to turn his scarred side from the room . But there was little chance of recognition here , either of face or voice ; unlikely that those of twenty years ago would be among the writers . Even the capital city 's Sunday School versifiers were imports , and anyonebeyond that usually spent his first check for bus fare to New York and then on to Connecticut . The president of the Authors ' Club , a teacher in the social sciences at the little Congregational College in Weld City , had tried his best to get Abigail to speak , even made a special trip down . All he got was a lot of encouragement to do something with the story of his pioneer aunt who came out to teach the Bible to the Indians and married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had hoped to honor the debunker of Franklin publicly . He did manage a promise that she would be at the dinner after Hamm agreed to go ; he even got her name into the World as an honor guest , back into the runover on page eight . Naturally the first-page space went to the main speaker , Wesley Brown Lowe , script director of eight daytime radio serials , all with villains who had Russian or Spanish names and thought up such devilish schemes as sending rattlesnakes in candy boxes to virtuous heroines . Since her resignation , Abigail found herself becoming the persecuted underdog to an increasing number of middle Franklinites , who had the parasite 's contempt for the institutionsthat kept the city alive . " Always making the little fellow the goat  --  " they told each other . Hoping that Abigail might be coaxed to speak after all , a large crowd of the town 's more curious turned out for the dinner , with many more coming in later . They got to see Dachel , anyway , with his thick auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leisurely grace and the fresh youth of him with envy and nudged each other at Cassie , whispering : " He 's living with her  --  and the ground not yet settled in on old Cobby  --  " Because Cassie demanded that at least one of her children attend the dinner with her , Marylin came . The mother would have preferred Harold . Two handsome young men were so becoming to a mature woman , she always thought . But the son had an important meeting on , and Cassie called Carl Halzer instead . He would be her guest , hers and Marylin 's , she said . He made a previous engagement in the best Blue Ridge manner , but when he wondered about her purpose at 1 Iamm 's , the Coot said he 'd ought to go . " They 's a free meal in it and while Cassie 's outfit wo n't vote for you anyhow , hundreds a people in this one-horse town will , just on the strength of you showing up there with t hem . " " And hundreds wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Carl said . The Coot was right , Hamm thought . Truckers and farmers did n't usually go to the writers ' dinner , and besides most of them were pretty solid for Carl anyway . He thought it might pay to go  --  besides being pretty funny . The farmer complained that he preferred growing corn and Berkshires for a living to politics and fun like that . " Well , you 'll probably have to go right on growing Berkshiresafter election , but you owe a little something to the signers of your petitions , if only a sincere effort  --  " The back of Carl 's neck was red enough from the sun and wind without the extra embarrassment that the airs of the Welleses caused him . But he managed to get through the diviner by looking over to the speakers ' table where Abigail was struggling with the big-shot talk of the script director , or off to the corner where he could see Hamm 's straight back.  | Before the coffee came the guild president arose to introduce the honor guests , Abigail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the surprised Carl  --  the most promising new timber of the election year . He was thankful , he said , to be living in Kanewa , and have the privilege of voting for a man like the Bellowing Bull of Bashan . " It is to young men like you , Carl , boys from the farm and the small town , uncontaminated by the parasitism of our midwestern capital cities , and to the young liberals from the industrial centers of the cast , that we must look for the preservation of our democracy , for the America Franklin and Jefferson hoped to build . " Carl 's face burned dark under the words of approval and the public smiling of Marylin Welles . Cassie managed a polite little nod too , and because the script writer 's talk was pretty dull the young reporter covering the dinner wrote an enthusiasticpersonality paragraph about the farmer , but Halzer had already become one of the unmentionables in the World , along with the words lousy , swell , suicide , and all forms of to seduce . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and people were moving about to sit at this or that table for a moment of visiting , Hamm suddenly found his mother at his side , although he had not seen her come in at all . So for the first time in twenty years he rose for her presence , awkwardly unable , without turning entirely around , to hide himself behind his scar . But Hallie Rufer Hammond paid no attention to him . She had been to the Patricians ' dinner , and just ran over for a glimpse of Wesley Brown Lowe , who once spent a summer in stock here  --  played the lead in Lightnin '  --  and very well . Seeing Mrs. Snell , she recalled a talk she heard at the League of Women Voters last week , on co-operatives . She was asked to give the independent dealer 's side , although Hammond 's , of course , was n't in competition with gas stations . However , it was only fair that she familiarize herself  |p161with  the arguments for co-operatives too , she said , smiling . They put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , Ona Snell said pleasantly , and she would see that it reached Mrs. Hammond . " Perhaps Mr. Rufe here could answer your questions , " she suggested . " In addition to keeping our books he handles our publicity . " Indeed ? Hallie Rufer Hammond acknowledged the silent bow of the man at her side . She might avail herself of the opportunity , she said , politely . And about the literature  --  could it be left at Hammond 's  --  at her own office , please . Their employees were really so busy , and she was always careful not to make extra work . Hamm looked after his mother , tall and handsome in her smoke-blue velvet dress under the sweep of a burgundy cape as she moved between the tables towards Cassie and the script director beyond . He saw her give a gracious hand to the young farmer from down the Little Grand , heard her tell him , " We are very interested in you as a rising young leader for the agricultural groups , " and then pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A story that his grandfather often told came back to Hamm : the story of a young woman carrying her first-born son on her back in a torchlight parade down Philadelphia Avenue . It seemed well that old George Rufer was long dead . While the local papers refused to mention Carl Halzer in any connection where " the wild-haired farmer from down the river " did n't fit , the Grandapolis Inquirer found praise of him good baiting for the capital city . They quoted the words of the president of the Authors ' Club and ran Carl 's picture , a good one , with his hair upstanding and strong , his mouth uncompromising , with the line " . . . Called Preserver of Democracy " under it . Charley Stetbettor denounced both Halzer and the professor as Communists , offering to prove that at least the professor was listed in The Red Network.  | Hamm Rufe told Carl , and they laughed a little over old Charley , and grew very serious . It was n't Stet 's saying these things that mattered but that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds lately , in spite of Marylin 's roadster so often parked around close . She generallybrought someone , not Harold , or any other man , but some girl or woman ; once it was Josina Black 's daughter Elizabeth , and several times Hallie Rufer Hammond , who really did seem interested . In the old days , in normal times , the farmer from the Little Grand might have become the outstanding young candidate of the campaign , made a good start towards a future victory . His background , as Hamm Rufe pointed out , was exactly right : a poor boy , with his mother either the only parent or at least the one who carries the load . There was Nebraska 's Senator Norris , whose father died when young George was four , Old Fighting Bob LaFollette , whose mother seemed to have kept the family going , and Kanewa 's own Senator Hanson , whose father was killed by a claim jumper before Gunnar 's eyes when the boy was twelve . Perhaps Norris and Hanson were not really the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new vintage . Certainly he had the uncompromising honesty and the courage . Could he capture the popular imaginationsufficiently to be elected once ? After that it was up to him . It was true that Carl Halzer seemed headed for liberalism early . In the eighth grade he memorized that portion of the Constitution called the Bill of Rights , and most of Goldsmith'sDeserted Village because his overworked teacher had been too busy with the primary folks to give him much time . He still remembered the portion beginning " Ill fares the land , to hastening ills a prey , Where wealth accumulates , and men decay . " Sometimes the teacher , not much older than Carl , had let him walk part way home with her evenings , and talk to her of these things , and of his great-grandfather , who ,  |p163when  only a boy , had followed Andreas Hofer , and then fled to America when the Tirolese patriot was captured and taken to Mantua . Once Carl sang a song for her , in a young , strong voice :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ihm shien der Tod gering . . So it would always be with patriots , did n't she think ? To them life without liberty was a death ignoble , to be despised . But his tongue was n't so ready around anybody else , and when he had to give a talk at the Farmers Union children 's day , it puffed like snake bitten and choked him down before them all , shaming his mother so he could scarcely come in for the milk pails that night . Years later when he was out helping to hold up farm foreclosuresduring the depression and saw the whole program collapsing for want of a spokesman , he found himself on his feet , and talking hard before he could be scared . He wished his mother were alive , then , to see , for she was of rebel stock , too , one ancestor a follower of Shays , in the great rebellion against debt and foreclosure . " You come by it natural , " she would have said to him . Each time after that words came easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so driven , until the movement spread into every county of the state , even in the face of armed deputies , militia , and tear gas , and the papers denouncingthem with the same old names of Red and Communist . But the insurance companies were n't wasting time namecalling . They saw this for what it was , a rising farm rebellion , and consented to a moratorium just in time . So with foreclosings done , Carl went home to put in his corn and that fall he found himself elected state representativeby a margin of twelve votes that survived a recount . He had gone out once more , as the Bellowing Bull , to talk for a try-out of the federal farm program . This time his leanfacedneighbors stood away from him , their mouths snapped shut . They had been burned once by listening to a Washingtonoutfit , Hoover 's Farm Board . Millions of dollars had been handed out , but did the farmers ever see a red cent of it ? No , by God . " If you want to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots , " they shouted to him from the back seats . And when a heckler pointed out that the Halzer place was clear enough of debt , the young farmer stopped his talk , stood silent , as though confused . Then , his voice low as any other man 's there , he answered : " Yes , I got the land , every acre clear  --  because my mother knew it was cheaper to have her son with old Lizzie Updike to help than to get a doctor from town . And my father figured it was cheaper to die than to go to the hospital for a pain in his side . They were right , for the east never let the land pay us enough for a decent birth and dying , and a decent living too . " Hamm was disturbed about Marylin Welles 's interest in Carl Halzer from the start . There was no telling how far a pretty , tricky girl like that could get with a serious , honest man , particularly an idealist like the farmer from down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drove right up before his shack in Herb 's Addition , stopping her car beside Carl 's and laying her palm upon the horn . The young farmer went out into the evening , his tawny hair red as fall meadow grass in the late sun . An hour later Marylin brought Carl back to the turnoff and he came to the dark shack and sat in silence on the chilly step beside Hamm . After a while he began to talk , not about the girl from Welleshaven but about his teacher , back in the eighth grade . She had urged him to put in an extra acre of corn every year , even if it meant plowing clear up into the very fence corners , oneCAPITAL CITY 165p165extra acre for books , magazines , and phonograph records . She even made out lists for him , and he still liked the " SpinningSong " that she gave him from her own records the day she went away . A laughing young man in a pink shirt had come for her in a new Model T , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember a little how she looked , " the man said slowly , picking at a calloused palm in the dark . " On nice days she used to come over the ridge on a short-cut to the schoolhouse . I never missed looking for her there . Did you ever notice how a woman looks on a ridge against an empty sky ?  --  " Somehow the chamber of commerce almost forgot the seventy-eighth anniversary of Franklin , what with election coming on and the papers full of sensational exposures and denunciations . But at last someone looked ahead in the calendar of events put out by the Federal Writers ' project  --  more of their good money thrown away . Ten days was n't long to get ready , but probably enough , with times not picking up as they had expected . Two years from now , for the eightieth anniversary , they would really put on a show , with whiskers and crinoline clubs , and the old-timers , like Horsemeat and the Coot , all rigged out with oxteams and old Springfields for the parade down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd all have more time and heart for the job . But they could manage a little parade for this year , too , with the school bands to get a crowd downtown , help the merchants . Then Parkins recalled that it was annual Franklin day on Kanewa 's football schedule , with Vincent Lopez playing for the All-City dance at the fieldhouse . Looked like somebody down at the stadium had been foresighted . There was foresightedness in the newspaper offices too , with proofs of the annual editions already considerably thicker than relief mattresses and still fattening.  | Each year the Capital City World set aside five or six pages in the Annual for greetings from famous gone-aways . Those who did n't reply in time got in anyway , with a listing of their affiliations , their wanderings , and their high positions in the world , generally without too much concern over accuracy . Many of the more famous names were borrowed . Lady Loper , for example , was n't from Franklin at all , but grew up Celia Stodding out on the Wakoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to finish up at the university , where her mother received the first law degree issued to a woman in Kanewa . But Celia was dismissed two weeks before commencementfor admitting her connection with the outlawed Torch . The handout sheet was started on the campus by Hallic Rufer 's Fabians back in the Populist nineties , revived by the pacifists during the World War , but driven undergroundalmost immediately as pro-German . It reappeared during the Sacco-Vanzetti trial , with a reprint of Edna St. Vincent Millay 's eloquent defense of the condemned men . The newspapers raised the cry of subversive activities on the campus , and the university authorities hired a Pinkerton detective . But he looked so much like the moving-picture correspondence school flatfoot  --  short neck , mean gash of a mouth , knife-edged hat drawn down to his nose  --  that the students spotted him at sight , and made much mysterious business for his attention . He had them rounded up in squads , grilled them for hours in Administration Hall , and got nowhere . Heckled by the whole country the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chap from outstate was dismissed from school . The boy was paying for his education and trying to help his family too by working eight hours a day in addition to his classes . It was spring , with lilacs outside the windows , and because the authorities kept him waiting ten minutes , he was asleep when they got around to him . Even after the detective slapped water in his face the boy could n't wake up entirely , and sop167that evening his picture appeared under a streamer , " Torch Man Discovered ! " But before they got him hustled out of town another issue of the Torch appeared in huge stacks at the street corners . The language , pungent as the wet mimeographink , denounced the faculty as waterlogged jellyfish , the administration as malicious and stupid jackasses , the detectiveas well-fitted for clubbing striking garment workers over the head . And at the bottom of the one sheet was the editor 's name : Celia Stodding , with her address and phone number and an offer of a personal escort for the detective if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally on an obscure street . " It turned out to be the Kay Dee house on Sorority row , and the alums , including Hammonds , Blacks , and Welleses , called a meeting to decide upon measures to protect the good name of the sisterhood from this flapper generation . They voted to drop Celia cold . The boy had to be released , after listening to a free lecture on the evils of shielding wrongdoers , particularly attractive women . Uncomprehending , the boy kept saying yes , yes , and finally got away , to plunge desperately into his studies . " You just ca n't afford to get far behind if you 're fixed like I am , " he explained . So Celia Stodding loaned the boy two hundred dollars she was to spend on her graduation , and took her dismissal . The administration had suggested voluntary withdrawal , and Celia considered it , because it would be less humiliating to her parents . " Make them throw you out ! " the angry mother telephoned . " Make them put themselves on record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considerable moralizing from the pulpits , and hot denunciation of this wayward and dangerous daughter of Kanewa by the American Legion , the D.A.R. , and the ColonialDames . But even so the Franklinites suffered no discernibleembarrassment , only surprise and envy when , three years ago , Celia Stodding married Lord Loper.  | " I 'd like to know how she got to him , " the ambitious mothers of the town demanded . It seemed that despite his title he was a liberal . While Blue Ridge refused to believe that , it seemed that he met the girl while in America investigatingthe federal resettlement projects . Celia , it was said , had been editing bulletins on the government setup . " Ah , " everybody said , knowingly , " then she really was a Red ! " This summer she ignored the invitation of the chamber of commerce to attend the Kanewa Fall Festival and coronation ball , and the offer of an honorary degree by the university , too . The World was n't balked so easily . Somebody rooted her picture out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannish 1927 haircut topped all the gone-aways in the Annual , the account of her triumphs unmarred by any mentionof her outstate origin , or that she did n't bother to acknowledge honors from the capital city . Like many another countrywoman of hers , and one particularly familiar to us all as Wally Simpson , Celia Stodding has won the love of a man of high title in our sister democracy . But with what a difference ! She is on intimate terms with Queen Elizabeth and her entire household ! The story was pure luck for Margaret Tyndale , still angry that her Mollie was so deliberately passed over for a skinny , store-made blonde at the coronation . Poor Samuel had done what he could ; closed up his account with Groves for wholesalegroceries entirely , trucking in everything for his stations . In addition he bought up the mortgages on the Acme Lumber and Grain Company and started a little price war with FranklinMills and Doover 's lumberyard . But back in early September , when they decided that Mollie should change Burt for escorts of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a distant relative in England , including court presentation , if that could be managed these times.  |p169Finally  one Saturday morning , early enough to make the Sunday papers , the cablegram came . It was an invitation from Lady Pyle to her dear kinswoman in America to be her guest for the winter and the court season . Samuel Tyndale waylaid the chamber of commerce reporter , spoke casually of Mollie 's invitation , quite casually , but managed to show him the cablegramand told him something of a possible Presentation dinnerbefore their daughter sailed . Yes , they might decide to humor Lady Pyle , and let her present Mollie at court . Not that it was important but womenfolks liked that sort of thing . Now there were suddenly many luncheons and parties for the girl , and by people who barely spoke to the Tyndales two weeks , even one week ago . No one dared risk omission from the Presentation dinner guest list . Eloise Johnson was the first with a cocktail at home , the day after the announcement , " For friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper said . No one missed it . Burt Parr , too , felt the results of the coming trip . He was offered a night job at one of the Tyndale stations , and at much better pay . He did n't like losing all his evenings but he could n't afford to refuse the money , even from Mollie 's father . Of course it was to keep him away from the girl , since fatneckedMilo Groves did n't please her . Lately old Chester Esthler 's son was taking her around , usually with Milo and his girl . Hamm was surprised . Old Chester was always consideredpretty queer , even though he was of an early family , earlier than the Blacks , and related to them , too , through his invalid mother . Peedie , the son , was a clear-skinned , mild young man , who was brought up by his cold-eyed grandfather , a minister , with no sparing of the whip and spoiling the colt . All except newcomers like Mollie seemed to keep away from Peedie . The rest had probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see his father and that old Chester would scare them so they ran home crying . But that was before the boy went away to a military academy and Chester was taken to the asylum . Sometimes Hamm wondered if Mollie should n't be told about the boy 's father , but the women in his life , from Hallie Rufer on , even friends like Abigail , all seemed so solidly able to look after themselves . Perhaps a man should grow up with at least one sister , younger and a little dependent , or better still with a lot of sisters and brothers , too . Hamm did n't see much of Mollie while the plans for the Presentation dinner grew . She drove out past Herb 's Addition alone several times , looking very smart in a new hematite red suit , furred deep and rich with pale blue-grey fox that set off the velvet of her eyes and the blackness of her hair . But she did n't stop in , and Burt Parr did n't come any more either . The seventy-eighth anniversary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tyndale dinner and the Franklin day rush of the football crowd . But the parade finally came , not too long after the earliest of the fans had started down towards the stadium . Somehow the coach let the football squad take part , leading off down the avenue behind the band , their cars whipping with purple and gold streamers , the crowd singing for them as they passed , enough for a losing team . Behind them came the cheer groups of the school , in color , too , followed by the important cars of the capital city , with pretty girls everywhere wearing golden chrysanthemums chenilled in purple K 's . There was one unfortunateincident , which the World played down and the Grandapolis papers broadcast to all the state : at the first gap in the parade a bunch of placard-bearing truckers poured out of an alley into the street , fell in and marched along , five abreast . In the center of the group half a dozen men carriedp171a long white sign at least ten feet high between them , giving the shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking production of Franklin , and the sharply rising amount of tax money spent in the city . And under it , in flaming red letters , was the line : BLOODSUCKING CAPITALCITY ! Here and there a shout or a little laughing broke out , spread along as the marchers passed . But this was a college town on a holiday , and so when the band began to play , the crowd all took it up singing " Kanewa , We love you , Fairest state of all , " to echo against the buildingsas they marched down the walks of Philadelphia Avenue to the football game . The farmers in for their Saturday trading did n't follow . They gathered as always around the old Union Market , the boys with an eye out for a girl that might be satisfied with a bottle of pop or a dime picture show , the women still tradinga few eggs and poultry , making the warm feeling of money to spend last as long as possible . Outside the men hung around to meet other renters , not saying much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they had a mind to . Yeh , a hell of a lot , the younger ones admitted openly . Company men been around , making poor mouths , saying times was hard , taxes sky-high , no profit . Retrenchment talk , the farmers agreed , moving their slitted eyes cautiously over the others , trying to single out the spy always among them , drive him from them with their private ways . Finally it came out . They were all holding back the same thing , as they had figured . The company reps were saying that if men like Powers won the election they were shutting down the tenant farms . " Shutting down all the places ? " a lean , stooped man asked , not believing . That 's what they heard.  | " Why , that 'd put five thousand , maybe ten thousand of us on the road , like them Okies going through  --  " Yeh . Yeh , it would ; twice , three times as many as that , maybe ; if all the companies got together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softballtournament done and with Saint Thomas parish slating its annual fair and Bingo evening for next week , first prize a trip to Hollywood . The other church women contented themselves with bridge benefits , bake and rummage sales , or Swedish and Chinese suppers , with their prettiest girls in costume ready to serve the men they hoped would come . Fall was always a time of celebrating in Franklin , a time for definite and conspicuous **26;5738;TOOLONG by special groups and by the city as a whole . As the future becameless promising , the past increased in importance , particularlythe farther , the more distant past . So while the Kanewa Historical Society managed no increase in its membership in Grandapolis or most of the smaller towns , in Franklin both the membership and the interest grew stronger every year . This fall the town was taking special interest in the Society'sannual meeting , for the long-projected Coolidge Room at the Historical Building was to be opened to the public and formally dedicated . It was really the capital city room , for the display of such items as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first organ brought to Franklin . But the space , much of the display and its upkeep too , was made possible by a grant from Mrs. Patton , a prominent W.C.T.U. and Woman 's Club worker . Quite naturally , she dictated the name . It started back in the prohibition days , when , in a book on education , somebody ran across Franklin 's advice to a young man upon taking a mistress . The good women of the town , without any special crusade under way , were free top173be shocked and horrified to find their fair city named for such a lewd and lecherous man . Mrs. Patton and two others went straight up to the local legislators . They wanted the name of the capital changed from Franklin to Coolidge , in honor of that noble American , Mr. Coolidge . One of the politicians hesitated , pulling at his lip . It would be hard to manage , would run up against natural inertia , and all the natural opposition to change . But it was most important , the women argued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What backing , " he wanted to know . " The Woman 's Christian Temperance Union , " Mrs. Patton said , and when he seemed unimpressed , she added the State Federation of Woman 's Clubs . She , herself , would stump the state , see that appropriate resolutions were passed , the legislativedesks flooded with letters and telegrams . " Who will finance this ? " the practical Franklinite inquired . The women of the state would raise hundreds , even thousandsof dollars if necessary . " Any trading stock ? " Oh yes , of course , the W.C.T.U. politician agreed . Well , that being the case , there might be a way . What were they prepared to offer ? " Anything ! " Mrs. Patton said firmly , the others nodding . " Anything ? . . . Um-m . . . m , " he said . So they got the bill through , although it cost them the Child Labor amendment , the anti-gambling bill , and the repeal of the anti-picketing law . There were a few unpleasant editorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women bore with Christian fortitude , as they did the surprisingamount of criticism from their fellow townswomen , even from such a civic leader as Hallie Rufer Hammond . They found her peculiarly unreasonable , perhaps because none of them bothered to ask who named the town . But hardestp174to bear was the governor 's veto . They finally took the matter up with Jim Farley himself , Mrs. Patton going all the way to Washington to see him , and a pleasant-spoken man he was , she reported , talking to her as one politician to another . " You are a woman of great influence , Mrs. Patton , " he told her , " and I 'll give your request every possible consideration . " Not slangy at all , as she had expected . But he did n't change the name of the postoffice , and by now almost everybody had slipped back into calling the town Franklin , even the chamber of commerce . But Mrs. Patton and her followers never did , and when she died she left the money and her early Franklin collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a formal dedication of the gift at the annual meeting of the Society , with Susan Welles in charge , assisted by Della Loran , and the Empress of Kanewa , off to school the next day , but looking mighty good , if the story about her name being in old Ed Chimmer 's book was really true . Someonehurried to make the first contribution to the room , a copy of William Allen White 's biography of Coolidge , not A Puritan in Babylon , which the ladies considered in very bad taste , but the earlier one , the campaign book . While Hamm knew that the city 's grandmothers would all be there , he decided to go to the Historical Society banquet anyway , and take Abigail . They went late , slipped into a back table , and beyond a little pointing out , they were almost immediately lost in the large crowd out to hear the wellpublicizedspeaker of the evening , an old Indian warrior , Little Bull , one of the last of the old buffalo-hunting Sioux . As the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Red Cloud , and was sixteen at the time of the Custer battle . But he never joined Wild West shows , spoke little English , and at the dinner he spoiled the high-flown introductionthat was interpreted for him by a great-grandson ,  |p175John  Little Bull , by interrupting with a very loud and unmistakable " No ! " No , he was no great chief , not now or any time , the old Indian insisted earnestly , his face like wrinkled brown kid leather , his braids thin and dust grey . But his lean figure was straight and noble in the snow-white , fringed and beaded buckskin , his hand proud on the long eagle-feather headdresshe did not wear but held up high , the ends trailing to the floor . No , he was no great chief , only the leader of one band of the Oglala , nor was he among the first Indians to cross the Little Big Horn to attack Reno . He was a boy then , with his uncle , the band historian , and was making pictures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help with the story telling for the campfires of the winters ahead . But when the column of dust that was like smoke on the hills showed the Indians the many soldier enemies that were coming to steal their lands , to kill their women and children , the duty of camp protection from attack came before history keeping and so he rode out , too , and shot some soldiers . He did not know how many , because the battle was thick and fast , and the dust hot and stinging in the eyes . Afterwards he rode back to find his sister and his mother and help gather the frightened people at a new place for the mourning time and the victory dance that would come afterward . He took no part in this dancing because while the warriors told their stories he had to make the pictures of the battle for the book that his sister always carried safe under her dress . He had to listen to the coup-counting , the challenging or acceptance , and put it all down . Then the Lakotah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered for the summer hunt , many going to the Milk River country away from the white man , for the Indian wanted only to be free and to keep his women and children safe . But what Little Bull had come to tell the white man was not the story of himself but of their river , the Wakan , the Holy Stream , that runs to the land from where the summer comes . It was named for the great black robe who had spent a winter with the Lakotah on this river when Little Bull 's own blood father was a small boy , many , many winters gone by . He was a very good and holy man , this black robe , and given great power of healing . When the stinking disease of the white man was cutting the Mandan down like hail on the new green grass of June , the holy one held their band back from going to the trader for one whole moon of praying to the Great Spirit . And when the time of fasting and songs was done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pony drags , and by spring no one of them was dead of the stinking disease but many of their brothers up at Soldier fort were gone as the snows before the Chinook . It was good work and holy by the black robe and so it was said that the river must be called Wakan the Holy Stream , so long as its water shall flow . That was all , and when the people saw that the old Indian was really done , the applause was very long , for there were few unmoved by the man 's simple , earnest tale . All this time Little Bull was calm before the staring faces , before the whispered word , and the hands of these people reaching out to finger the fringe of his buckskin , pretending that he did not notice these very great discourtesies to a guest among them . When there was silence once more the white men rose with many rapid questions : " How many scalps did you take ? " " Did you steal horses ? " " Did you see Custer killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man smiled a little and said " Hou ! " meaning only that he understood , and then set to answering them , carefully and patiently , as they came . But at last he spoke sharply to the youth , who said , " Great-grandfather , he is very old and very tired , and will go now . " So they both sat down . Many were cross at this abruptness , thought the old Indian was rude , still a savage ,  |p177des|pite  all the money the government had spent on him and his kind . But he seemed gentle enough as they crowded around him to examine his costume once more , to tug at the precious eagle feathers of his headdress . It was n't until afterwards , when the youth led his great-grandfather out , that many discovered that the old Indian was totally blind , blind from the white man 's trachoma.  |p178THE  sky of early October lay bright as naked steel on the clear flowing streams of Kanewa , the timber along their breaks golden , the sweeping uplands browning to belie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Indian blood on the crests along the highways and dusty clumps of seeding goldenrod and white asters leaned in ragged confusion against the ditches and cuts , while out in the pastures bunches of purple wand stood like sticks thrust into buried pots . It was picnic time for middle Franklin , with a great hurryingaround after work to change into slacks and flying shirt tails ; early honkings on Sunday mornings , and weary evening returns with armfuls of bittersweet for house baskets , and sumac and cattails for the old umbrella stands dragged down from the attic to the living room . The society columns were full of engagements and marriage plans under the standing head " October Weddings . " There were half a dozen from the homes along Blue Ridge and the slope this side  --  nice young people , mostly girls marrying out of town , Dallas , say , or Denver or perhaps Washington , D. C. Appropriate positions would be made for the local boys in the family interests of the capital city ; Felton 's , Fine Stationery , was very busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the love business sure was picking up , the gas-station manager told Burt Parr . The fine , warm , moonlit nights of early October were topping any spring week in rubber-goods sales at the station , three for a quarter , old and rotten and ap179lot of the damn fool kids getting themselves on fire , but his business was to keep the Tyndale stock moving . " Quite a sideline they 've worked up over there for you  --  " Hamm told Burt . The boy looked down upon his hands , his chin line getting lean the last few weeks . Yes , it was pretty bad , he admitted . Sometimes a girl tried to remind the man , poke him , or say something low , and maybe all she 'd get would be a " What the hell ! You can take stuff afterwards  --  " No , hopping cars for Samuel Tyndale was n't like working at the Co-op . Burt had never worked for a private concern much , and he guessed it was up to a man to do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his home up on the Wakoon seem like a fine place to be . Hamm nodded . It must be a mighty fine place to be , but there were always considerations beyond the moment . Yes  --  well , Burt could n't remember that Old Samuel and the others were like this , up the river there . Maybe living here , with the capital city folks , made them so different . The people stopping at the station were always hurrying to get away , always acting trapped , like the old grey wolf up in Stoor 's Park that even runs around his little pen between chews at a fresh bone . Here they all seemed to be tearing out every free minute , even if only for a swing around HorseshoeBoulevard . Those that could , got way out into the country . Even if they had to turn right around and come back they 'd go as far up as the cabins on the Narrows of the Grand , where the water runs swift and clear over the rock , and the oaks begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the cottonwoods , and the cedar bluffs , way up the river towards Wild Horse Plains . Out there ducks were swarming thick over the sweetwater lakes , they told Burt , and geese came honking in at dusk , or gabbled soft in the cornfields , the pheasants running with heads out like spear points through the Russian thistles of the stubblefields. 180 CAPITAL CITYp180Yes , Hamm knew how they talked about it . And weeks before the hunting season everybody in Franklin seemed to be oiling up a gun and letting out last year 's hunting pants another notch , maybe even leaving the top button open for extra spread under the belt . They seemed to be laying in a little more whiskey than last year , too , and a little less ammunition , for , privately , of course , times were better , with a real building boom on in town , much of it federal money , but still the biggest year since 1928 and the second biggest since 1900 , not counting the capitol , of course , which was public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie fire hanging over the ridges just outside of town as though waiting to move in . On the capitol grounds the wide sprayers were still turning over the lawn that had greened up dense and soft as a new rug since the frost , but most of the town lawns were deep in browning leaves waiting for a wind . Down on the avenuethe better windows were cold with artificial snow for the skating and ski-suit displays , only Hammond 's giving space to a southern cruise window . Sheepskin coats , rubber boots , and fleece-lined overshoes were neatly pyramided at MontgomeryWard 's , piled in stacks three feet deep at the Army and Navy store . The first cold morning would bring hurry-up calls to storage for the fur coats . It would come with a suddenthickening of the ice in the bird baths , the sky greying , and the wind sweeping chill along the streets , banging the loose signs and awnings of summer . Out at the rendering works the old coyote would howl late at night and the next morning there would be snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs down , the windows boarded over , like the eyes of a weary toad closing to await another spring . Then suddenly there was something besides elections , picnics , hunting , and winter coming soon to think about in the capital city  --  another death on Blue Ridge . It was no duke in satin britches in a toilet this time , but quiet little Penny Hammond , found dead on her chaise longue in a new maroonp181velvet house gown , dead of an overdose of sleeping tablets . The maid could n't wake her , or Cecil Hammond either . Two doctors came ; she was dead . She had n't been very well the last week , must have suffered a lapse of memory , and kept taking the tablets until the bottle was empty . Slowly Hamm Rufe dropped to his step to look through the story in the evening paper , stopping several times to look at the picture of this woman who had married his brother Cecil , the mother 's baby , his father 's favorite son . Penelope had evidently been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad forehead , and a sadness about the far corner of her mouth , as though she , too , had a side she must turn away . Hamm looked down over the city , with its capitol tower high and remote , and beyond , to the dwellings of Blue Ridge , with their lawns that were the dark fall green of generous sprinkling and long , chilly nights . And all around that tight little world overlooking old Mud Creek Valley , wide , rolling plains reached far out towards the headwaters of the Grand , the Lasseur , and the Wakoon , plains tawny as the antelope that once roamed their slopes , the air moving as free . It was from out there that Penny came , and it must have been hard for her to die here , when the sky was the knife blue of October over all the earth of Kanewa . Hard for little Penny to die so . He thought of Cecil , Cees , as everybody called him , the son that remained with Hallie Rufer Hammond , to peter away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he married , ten , twelve years ago , he was secretarytreasurerand manager of Hammond 's , once a hardheaded concernthat made no compromises at all on quality . But under Cees , an arty , modern air had entered the business , particularly when the new building was added along in the late twenties , with two floors of interior decoration , including a model suite of rooms that he did over every few months . He took an interest in the private lives of his help , too , knew the marital troubles of his window dresser and the latest complaint of theP182bedfast mother-in-law of the head shipping clerk . He arranged employee savings accounts for small stock purchases in the company , and initiated bonuses . Of course there were those , even among the Blue Ridgers , who pointed out that the bonus idea came to him when the undistributed profits tax was put on . Still , other concerns in the capital city seemed to get around it . Few doubted that Cees did try to be completely honest with himself and the whole world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in regularly . In his own pale , yellow-grey eyes , Cecil Hammond was a great home body . When he married Penelope Shelton from outstate , he built a large , loose sort of home on the Ridge , the whole structure planned about a living room easy with islands of chairs and low tables and books within reach of either hand . In the alcove was a built-in pipe organ for the lessons both he and Penny were taking . They had many informalevenings with comfortable people in ; a congenial professoror two , or a writer or painter or musician , not to be lionized , definitely not , but to mix casually with a few of their own set . There were always extra men to help things along , and the new book out and open , to start the talk going , or something especially appropriate , as the biography of Pilsudski during the siege of Warsaw , a Zaharoff biography when the talk turned to Chamberlain 's holdings in munition firms . The Hammond dinners were the pleasantest in town . Cees. carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working series of host signals with his wife . He was the solitary male of a very feminine establishment , as he called it , consisting of a saddle mare , a Great Dane bitch , a maltese tabby , and his Penny . At his office he kept track of their seasons by x 's on the calendar , his wife delicately , discreetly , in an almost invisible marking down in the corners of the dates , the cat 's frankly under the figure , the mare 's covering the entire square , for he liked to ride and must keep those days clearly in mind . With Penny he read a great deal of modern psychology ,  |p183|particularly  on the more intimate human relations ; he specializedin civilized understanding and dissected every attitude , every emotion , calmly and scientifically . Certain characteristics in himself he labeled dominant maleness , in his wife as female possessiveness  --  not for purposes of praise or condemnation but strictly for greater appreciation , sympathy , and understanding . Because Penny never seemed very strong it was agreed that they take Cecil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer she should go to the mountains alone . These months of retreat in the pines did her no end of good and contributed much , Cees was certain , to their exceptional compatibility . He maintained , however , that the real key to their happiness was their scientific approach to the physical aspects of the problem . To acquaintances who seemed in need of advice he explained that woman was a delicate and sensitive mechanism . Fortunately a doctor had done a rather good book on the subject , and because he could n't discuss such intimate details , he was always glad to help by writing the title down on a sheet of his pale blue scratch paper . " There  --  and you 'll find this perfectly reliable  --  and conduciveto the  --  ah  --  the greatest happiness in your marital relations , as Penny and I can attest , " he would say , lookingup through his desk glasses as he held out the little blue slip . This fall Penelope had come back from the mountains a little later than generally , and on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return then , and agreed that it was really because of the unseasonable heat in Franklin and not from any subconscious desire to avoid her husband . That was a month ago , and now she was dead . Dr. Carlson had been most sympathetic . Pregnancy sometimes affected delicate , sensitive women that way the first few months , a temporary depression which passed when the endocrines adjusted themselves .   " She should have been in for an examination and advice long ago  --  " Cees , dazed and appalled by the suggestion of pregnancy , his head bowed over numb hands , had n't been very attentive . The charge of neglect roused him to some defense of his Penny . " But Mrs. Hammond could n't have guessed more than a few days , at the most ! " he objected . " Oh , more than that , " the doctor said reasonably , seeing how confused the man was . " I should say a good two months and over  --  Cees Hammond looked up blankly and finally nodded , his habit of automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course  --  I 'm so confused  --  the shock  --  " he apologized . Known over two months  --  he calculated as clearly as he could . That put it back to July . He had been up to see her the Fourth , which was to have worked out well with the calendar , but the last day a wire had come from Penny saying that she was unavoidably indisposed . He knew what that meant , but he went anyway , and found her nervous and cross with herself for disappointing her husband . The altitude had never affected her so before . He had acted the kind and understandingpal , and was touched by her good-bye at the station . " You do love me a great deal , Cees , " she had said . Now all that week-end looked so different . When he could slip away from the house without it seeming strange , he went down to the store , to his private files to look through his letters from Penny , one every day , all summer . From the earliest he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . But there was not one name he could single out , not one circumstance . And so at last he had to go home , to the house suddenly much too large and too loose about him , as though he had shrunken so much . P185The city below the Ridge rolled the death of Penny Hammondon its tongue , although still a little jaded by the stronger meat of Cobby Welles 's ending . Casual acquaintances remembered the everlasting talk Cees was always putting on about Penny 's sensitiveness and decided that perhaps he was right . Many of those who knew something of Penny 's conditionremembered the advice he was always offering , particularly to newly married couples . " I did n't think old Cees had it in him , " Freddy Black admitted in the lockers out at : rrand Vista . " Josephine and I fell for his song and dance about his system , and found ourselvesparents in nine months flat . Since then I 'd had a suspicion that maybe Cees was n't so inflammatory  --  " Long before this there was talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Penny 's older sister Marian , married to a poorly paid professor of Greek up at Walden . When she saw how aged , how broken and lost Cees was , she could only go on as his wife had all those years , comforting him by letting him talk it all over and over , until the last bit of flavor was chewed from it , until only bare , tasteless shreds remained . Time after time that long night he returned to Penny 's delicate condition , as he called it . Why had n't she confided in him ? Of course he was proud of their system of , ah , control , but to die for its failure  --  he could n't get over such a thing . Towards two in the morning he finally broke down . He had to know the truth . Marian looked through the grey water of her tears upon the man who had married her beloved baby sister . Little Penelope came trailing along several years after the other girls . Without a playmate her own age she grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants of every crying youngster of the small town that Grandfather Peter Shelton had built . And somehow it had come to this . But there was no shirking the need of Cecil now , or he would be a man bedeviled to the end . So Marian admitted that there was more to it than just Penny 's fear of disappointing him , wounding his pride in a vulnerable spot ; she was afraid of hurting him mortally . Penelope , their little Penny , had fallen in love this summer , and with her natural honesty , she could make no pretense to herself or to the man . They talked it over between them a hundred unhappy times , and finally decided to come to Cecs , tell him as well as they could , and go away together . But it seemed too brutal , and when the man said he must come , Penny forbade him . She would tell Cees herself . She had tried to tell him when he was up the Fourth , and could n't ; she tried the first day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't easy for Penny to hurt anyone , not a man who had put his whole thought and dependence upon their life together as Cees had , and all his deep affection . Marian spoke slowly , in a monotone , as impersonally as possible , trying to save the man she had to wound . But now for the first time she saw the Cecil Hammond that was the son of Hallie , his mother , and something more that she could n't know , something of old George Rufer , the Pennsylvaniagrandfather . Dry-eyed , controlled , he stopped before her chair . Only the thin , sensitive hands hung too straight at his side . " Would you have taken this way out ? " he asked at last , and the woman had to admit that she thought not . " No  --  " he said slowly , with his habitual preciseness . " No , nor would Penny , ten years ago . It seems  --  yes , I fear it means that I have done my most beloved a very great wrong . " Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , the second of those small , private processions from Blue Ridge within little more than a month . Burt Parr watched the cars come back past the Tyndale filling station , Old Samuel 's car sweep imposingly by , right up behind the oldest families now . Mollie must be on the far side , probablyp187sat there deliberately , he thought , looking for her under the visor of his brown cap , and letting the tank he was filling run over . Out in Herb 's Addition Hamm Rufe thought of the day Stephani left him with only a picture to hang over the fireplace and he found it hard not to go to his brother , to stand without clutter of words beside him in this bad time . But nothing would be mended so , no pain made easier , and so he walked out northward , as far as the breaks of the Grand River , a clear , swift stream that gleamed in the late sun like the hot new metal he once saw flowing from a furnace up in Leadville . But the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood along the bottoms , but trees golden with autumn ; the farm homes broad and clean-painted , for here there was water , and good soil , and hope for the spring . Hamm came back tired as from a day at rock crushing and slept , but the next evening he had to see his brother . It was night when he walked from the bus stop to the wide terracesof the Hammond home . The row of windows across the front stood undraped and tall , their light stretching far down the sloping lawn . Hamm kept close to the high side fence of brick until he could see into the living room . There was only Cees , sitting on a low bench , bowed forward over something on his knees , a book or a picture probably , something that took him back to a time when Penny was still there . When Hamm finally started away he walked far out around the town to his shack , keeping to the deep darkness that gathers just beyond a field of lights . Ever since the coronation ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit-downers at the relief offices , strikers parading and fighting back against finks and gunmen , fiery crosses burning on the capitol lawn , Gold Shirts accused of hit-and-run driving , bricks flying through old Samelly 's poor window , and people up on Blue Ridge swallowingbottles of poison . " They 's actin ' like a string a green pack horses in lion country , mountain lion country , " Old Horsemeat said . " Hell , any herd a green horses has got more sense than this outfit here , " the Coot snorted . " This here town 's been acting like the frost-chilled cockroaches in that old rusty bake stove outside of my cave when the sun hits it direct  --  scurrying around , scart crazy at anything , even if it 's only the sun warming up their freezing butts a little  --  " Over a cup of coffee Hamm Rufe listened to the old-timers already chewing the winter fat , although it was not yet middle October . Last year it had been the power fight in the legislaturebut mostly the disappearance of small nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting among them readingletters from the old country and blowing their noses hard into their colored handkerchiefs . A pack of hungry grey wolves , eating up the weak ones , the Coot had called it . No , Old Horsemeat insisted , those foreign countries were acting just like human critters , like that Donner party did , fooling along all summer and then having to eat each other up in the winter to get across the mountains to California . Hamm Rufe listened to the old-timers , a little smile on the good side of his face as they compared his city to a string of green horses in lion country , or cockroaches scrabbling in terror at a little warmth on their rears . But perhaps there was something to it . For twenty years he had followed what at first seemed sporadic outcroppings of stress and violence but later saw as great waves breaking over America like the lines of a weather map . Perhaps these old-timers who had spent most of their lives in the capital city as outsiders saw something in her uneasiness that neither he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect . The last month Hamm had been occupied with his shock over Cobby , his grief over his brother 's bereavement , thep189difficulties of his acquaintances . Now trouble had suddenly moved in at the Co-op . From the start Franklin was even less friendly to the co-operative idea than other towns . It was expected that the advertisers ' combine would close the papers to all news of the venture and even to their ads , but from the first the police kept pecking at them like chickens at a sproutinglettuce bed , beginning with the builders , accusing them with alley blocking . Since then it was one petty charge of public nuisance or another . Now , apparently the junior chamber of commerce , Milo Groves , president , had settled upon the final destruction as a sort of graduation exercise . It was n't the first organized attempt to put the Co-op out of business . Almost before the gas pump was up , the private oil companies began to cut prices to run the new competition out of town . The manager met the cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns went farther , he called a meeting . Along towards midnight , after the two old Socialist members had exhausted their fondness for dialectics , Ada Jims and her husband had their usual public quarrel , and everyone had ridden his pet hobby , Ona Snell and Professor Ford of the history department took the initiative . The purpose of the co-operative was not to undercut private concerns but to save , through dividends to the shareholdingconsumer , the profits between tank car and automobile . At the present low price no such profit existed , and with it their reason for running . The station 's closing was described by the World in an obituary editorial as " another Communistic venture that started optimistically into the air , has nosedived , and like a ragged kite of spring , has been left to flutter its tatters into winter on the solid wires of private endeavor . " Two weeks later , when gas came up again , the station reopened . The shrewd Samuel Tyndale , new to the city then , had seen the importance of even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small-salaried white-collar workers . He lagged behind on the price rise , dropping periodically to half a cent under the low of the private companies , and thereby built up enough trade for his five big stations . But it did n't help Mollie become empress of Kanewa . Since then the Co-op had faced a rezoning order , suits over their fine corner location , and delayed and inadequate deliveries , an old complaint that compelled the co-operatives of the upper Mississippi region to set up their own wholesalers in Minneapolis , where Burt Parr had spent a year . The purchase of an oil-blending plant at North Kansas City and their own truck lines insured the Franklin supply , but no Franklin affection . In addition , as Milo Groves told the chamber , they were siding with the strikers , some of their employees taking an active part , particularly that scar-faced tough called Hamm Rufe who lived out at Bums ' Roost and wrote dirty articles about the employers for the labor papers and the Nation . Now that the local co-operative was trying out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days , the planned attack was hurried . With the station 's , most pleasing young attendant , Burt Parr , already hired away by the Tyndales , Milo did n't have to hand advancement to a man he still believedwas a rival , no matter what Margaret Tyndale planned . But he offered Hamm Rufe a job , full time , at Groves , WholesaleGroceries . Hamm refused , and at once the young politiciandropped all his air of flattery , his talk of their need of an extra-good bookkeeper . You may find it expedient to change your mind  --  " Hamm Rufe rubbed the burning scar of his cheek , his usually mild eyes suddenly a dense grey . Fat-necked Milo , junior member of Groves , with a large block of Hammondownedstock , coming to threaten him  --  Milo , with the broad , tallowy face that spread to jowls sitting flat on his shoulders , threatening . " Have you ever seen a liver worm , Mr. Groves ? " Hamm asked , conversationally . It is a leech-like creature that growsp191in the liver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , stagnant streams , and it , too , has no neck . " For a few days there was nothing more , not until somebody remembered that Sid Harper , the manager of the Co-op , was also head of one of the agencies on the Community Chest list . He received his orders : " Get out of that collectivistic set-up or you 're off our payroll . " He was a young family man with a future before him , as they pointed out , and so he took the job offered by Smith and Batton , Real Estate , a job with a desk but no buzzer . Smith put him on but did n't pretend to like it . " Why I always got to give all your crippled ducks a swimmingpond I do n't see  --  " he complained . But he knew there were people in Franklin who could put him inside of stone walls for a nice stretch , no matter how big a Klansman he was . So Harper went into the basement offices , and Hamm refused the Co-op managership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive . Reverend Ausberg grinned broadly , and in his outspoken manner admitted that they had discussed these shortcomings and decided upon him anyway . Perhaps Hamm would accept an acting managership until they found someone ? Yes , that he could n't refuse . Next the energy boys from the junior chamber tried to get at the members from the university staff through the regents , demanding their withdrawal from the Co-op or their resignation from the public payroll . It looked easy , until they were shown the list , over forty , some with powerful outstate followings , like Erickson , the Engineers College 's expert in irrigation and water power , and Dr. Reynolds , Kanewa 's most popular high-school commencement orator . A delegation was sent to appeal to their pride in the American way , to stress the importance of the university taking a strong stand against Communistic enterprises , but the members stood fast , asking some disconcerting questions of the platitude boys , as Professor Ford called them . The regents , so far as the public could discover , took no action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a showing to get him to the legislature next election , congress later , since he was no good in the grocery business anyway , and the Ridge needed representation . So one evening along about seven Hamm Rufe heard the Dillard boys calling out , " Yeh , there it is  --  the one with the screen door  --  ! " A small , fussy , bespectacled man came up on the stoop to knock and stand . Hamm turned down the Beethoven and went to the door . The man said he was Purdy Gilson from the Vigilant Taxpayersand would like to come in a minute . He had some ideas that might interest a voter of Mr. Rufe 's caliber . So he came in , took the one chair , and looked around . No , he did n't smoke , as though impatient at the interruption . Mighty snug and comfortable spot Mr. Rufe had here . And books , too . Any rare ones in the lot ? He bent over , raked one out , one of the backless Godey 's that Coot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old things . He looked at the date , 1858 , and peered silently over his glasses to Hamm Rufe , his mouth puckering as he laid the book down . " Ah , a music lover , too , " he said , turning up the radio and whirling the dial through screaming stations . Hamm nodded over his pipe . Yes , indeed , a very comfortable place , under the circumstances , Purdy Gilson thought , and went away without sayinganything about his ideas , but leaving the Taxpayers League card , the platform on the reverse , with two blackfacelines across the bottom : Rigid Economy in Government and Immediate Return to the Principles of the Founding Fathers . Another crank , Hamm thought , and went back to his music.  |p193But  the next day the World carried a front-page story of governmentwaste : single men living in luxury on relief , with fine radios , collecting art works and rare books . With typical anonymity the paper gave no names and only along in the second paragraph Hamm Rufe began to realize he was the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shack and its interior , with a close-up of his radio and fireplace , a volume of Godey set up conspicuously under the picture of Stephani . For the first time it seemed necessary to put a lock on anything out in Herb 's Addition . Within an hour after the paper hit the front porches of the town Jo Davis , a case worker delegated to investigation , came out . The county relief office was swamped with protestsabout a man living in luxury out here , living in indolent luxury by the sweat of the taxpayer 's brow . " Although they 've got my shack in the paper it could n't be me  --  " Hamm laughed . " You know who 's on relief . " Of course , but people are up to tricks , sometimes . There had been considerable trouble the last two months , with several deliberate plants and so on , to make scandal before election , and the office was n't taking any chances . Too bad , too , with so much real work to be done . Hamm nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble was n't started by Purdy Gilson , the nosey little ferret out from the Vigilant Taxpayers . Of course the case worker could n't say where the complaint originated , but he did know the man when Hamm showed him the card . Gilson was investigator for the two , three thousandfarms that the Kanewa Investment Company had taken over the last ten years . So  --  ? Hamm smiled a little as he rubbed his scar . So Old Purdy was working for the K.I.C. , for Hallie Rufer Hammond , president ; he , Hamm Rufe , a big stockholder . He fancied the shake of Gilson 's slack pants if he were to walk in there with his identification tomorrow , say about ten-thirty ,  | and the place full of poor devils waiting on the straight-back benches . Yes , the case worker was saying , a town like this made a lot of trouble for a conscientious relief administrator . Took so much time to scare the eye-picking buzzards away there was n't much left to help the old mare to her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hamm knew them , the Overtills and the Dillards . And there would be more if it were n't for the rule that single people had to go to the poor farm . Hamm had heard a lot of talk about that rule around the shelterhouse on cold nights last winter . The poor farm was ten miles out , with no chances to come in at all to pick up a loose penny . Old Hayden , flooded out of his cave in the sewer early in September , was already writing complaining postcards to his friends ; the social contacts out there were most restricted . Hamm still could n't see what they hoped to gain by making him out a relief case , beyond embarrassing the Co-op , but after that first professional call the tall , serious young Jo Davis often stopped in on his rounds for a cigarette and a bit of talk . He was of a middle Franklin family , graduate of K. U. , with a double major in history and sociology , the sociology because the history had led him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the laissezfairedays that the Franklinites admired so . With his degree , and with a doctor in the family , he thought he knew about poor and hungry people , even though he was distantly related to the Hammonds . " You know  --  of the store and finance Hammonds , filthy with money , " the young man said . Hamm refilled his pipe and gave silent acknowledgment . Yes , he knew of the Hammonds . Almost at once the youth discovered that his knowledge of poverty was like that of most of his associates , knowledge of the intellect only . When the food riots brought federal re/lief , with a shortage of trained case workers , he was taken on , sent out with an old hand . He came back dark with bitternessagainst his parents who had brought him up to speak of a pauper class , to say " People are like that because they want to be . " So he got a transfer to Grandapolis and took over the unemployables in the squatter section on the Wakoon River bottoms , nothing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shacks dry , even the Coot 's cave a decent home compared to the Canned Heat Flats . Hamm agreed . He had seen the moldering dumps on the Wakoon bottoms twenty years ago , and the same thing in California and in Louisiana and along the Shore Line back when Hoover was still the great engineer who had fed millions of starving people somewhere across the sea . Jo Davis from middle Franklin was shocked by the habitations , some built way back in the hard times of 1907 and ' 08 , or before , in the packing-house walkouts , with the strikers blackballed in every plant in the country . Three of these were still there , their families scattered thirty years ago , the men old now and crippled from the damp , but still unwilling to go to the county farm . A man 's house was his castle , even a moldy old hole of tin and driftwood on fill-in land was his castle . Since his father died Jo Davis came back here , and saw what a few years under the slow starvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , grown men and women grey-skinned and listless from chronic malnutrition . Those who plumpened in a puffy sort of way were dragged up before protest hearings to prove that the reliefers were well fed , living on the fat of the land . If anybody made too big a rumpus he lost his $6.00-a-month food allowance , stood to lose it anyway if the reactionaries won the election . Not that there was much trouble ; a couple of years living like that and the kick was gone out of a man . Once in a while somebody got excitable , asking , " Why don't The audience was receptive , whooping and stamping as Old Charley Stet rehashed in lurid detail the testimony of the investigators who had looked through the hole in the ceiling upon Ed Chimmer 's operating table . That night a young woman was dragged into the bushes not a block from the fieldhouse , and the next few days there were dirty words on walks and fences , peeping Toms in the residence sections , a whole flood of obscene letters and postcards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to coax little girls into alleys . The rest of the Chimmer trial was behind closed doors . The trial judge , a long-boned Swede , born near the forks of the Grand River , denounced the hysterical interest of the town , " Unconcerned with the evils of society , these people gorge themselves on the morbid details like buzzards after a hard winter . " The Methodist bishop backed the judge , saying it did little good to preach against the Charley Stetbettorsor to punish the Eddie Chimmers , " without an honest attempt to diagnose and cure the sick and corrupt society that breeds them . " Another churchman took to his pulpit against the bishop , accusing him of loose and sensational talk designed to shake the faith of the people . For weeks the papers were full of angry letters on both sides . In the meantime , Eddie Chimmer drew a hung jury . There seemed to be about as many visitors at Abigail 's apartment as ever , townspeople coming as before , but lookingup and down the street before they slipped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her work to the researchers ' alcove of the university library , or the newspaperbasement in the Historical Society building . But there were few public invitations to turn down and when Erich Hagge , the poet of the Montana wheatlands , came through on Town Hall he had to insist that she be asked to the dinner given for him.  | " Miss Allerton has written a good book . She has made a living record of your city  --  " he told the committee . Yes , yes  --  of course , but she was , well , not the social type . Perhaps one must permit a writer certain peculiarities  --  So he called Abigail himself . Diffidently she came down to tea with him , a little shy because he was known as a great poet of the folk and a great liberal . Erich Hagge turned out to be a large , quiet , and friendly man , his face strong as weathered hickory under a thatch of mouse-grey hair , his eyes wrinkle-nested , his brows wide and steady . While Abigail was wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in this region whom she should know . He had written some fighting articles for the liberal press the last twenty years , a recent one on the strikebreakingtactics of the trucking operatives in Kanewa . Hamm Rufe was the name . Abigail nodded . Yes , she knew him , and his writing , but very little beyond that . He never talked about himself . " I have been told he 's from an old midwestern family , liberal once , well-to-do now and reactionary , like so many . It seems he left home over his objection to the World War  --  " Yes , that might be true , Abigail admitted . Anyway he was living in a hooverville shack out across the bottoms now , and working for the Consumers ' Co-operative . At that the poet laughed deep . So it was the same here too , the interesting people living in hoovervilles ! Was she from out there ? No , but Abigail had to admit that she was n't liked any better by the city . Yes , oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her called . He knew the look well ; for years it was directed toward him . Of course . Track layers and harvest hands were not always considered fit subjects for poetry here . " Exactly , nor camp cooks , or labor orators , or WPAers . " Those still were n't , not here , Abigail reminded him.  | " No , for these people feel the instinctive fear of the parasite for the mazy who produces . But they seem no longer afraid of me  --  " he said , a little amusement about the corners of his wide mouth , and a little sadness too . He was only a speaker now . Still , they had treated him generously out on the Ridge , piled on cocktails , food , and flattery ; had taken him through the capitol . He found it a fine building , but they made him listen to the cost of every pillar , almost every tile  --  Abigail nodded . She knew how it would seem to this man who spoke so directly , who looked so straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a new country , appraising its contours , its soil , and its sky . " You are to come to the dinner , you know  --  " he said , " and sit beside me so someone within hearing will find me intelligible  --  " " Not when they do n't want me  --  " " Then I do not go . " Knowing that he probably meant it , she went , and did n't mind so much , because he told them all that she was there as his special guest , " one of the capital city 's distinguished citizens , " he said , making her ears burn . After the speech she went to the depot with him . Over coffee they talked about their growing years on the farm , plowing time , and threshingwith its grain scooping , its band cutting , the dust of the strawpile , with beards thick down the sweating neck . Yes , yes , and then there was that trick of walking around on the old horsepower to keep from getting dizzy and sick . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though they had grown up across the two ruts of wagon wheels from each other instead of two states and twenty years apart . " Today I have found a friend  --  " he told her as the train pulled out . Just when things had quieted down Hattie , Cobby 's little Hattie , as everybody called her , decided to come back homep201for Pulaski Day . Not that the Poles of the bottoms made a great fuss over this holiday here , but it was a time of sitting around together , of recounting tales of the old country , with food all day and drink ; and in the evening their own dances . Even when those in the old homeland were bombed and shatteredand dying they danced , for was that not the greatness of their people , that they could be killed but never defeated ? Then the next morning they always hung their flags once more , for the Columbus Day of their new homeland , America . This year was not all badness , for one who was away would return . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a chattering and a moving from one back fence to another to tell that Hattie , the Krasinskis ' Hattie , was coming home . While some stood away at the news , it was only a short time before there was knocking on front door and back at the little white house for a word , and a taste of Anton 's bottle , brought up out of the cellar , as is proper when a wandering one returns . Somehow the papers heard about it and had reporters and photographers at the train . But the Love Pirate line did n't seem just the right one to use any more , particularly since the talk over Penny Hammond 's affair . Nor did the title fit Hattie very well , in spite of a little retouching on her picture , a shortening of her skirts , and the addition of a lift to its flare as though by a gust of wind or a saucy flip . She still looked a lot like any pretty , warmhearted little Polish girl . Her apartment , stripped of everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she went down to the white house in the Polish bottoms . The mustached old Polak father took up his yard rake against the reporters . " Go'dam chicken hawks ! " he roared . " Always hangin ' roun ' ! " The authorities wanted to know about a few things , like Cobby 's fifty thousand dollars in negotiable paper missing from the bank.  | Oh , she had it ; all signed over to her . But she knew it would all have to be returned ? " Why ? " she wondered . " Did n't it belong to Mr. Welles ? " That was as far as they got , and while Hamm was a little uneasy about the Gold Shirts , afraid they might threaten Hattie , there was nothing that he could see to do . When the girl tried to get her old job as stenographer back she was told that no married man would dare hire her , so she took up beauty-parlor work , and was sought out almost the first day of her apprenticeship , for it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another juicy bit for the gossips of the town , too , another bit of Wellesiana . The globe-trotter , Colonel Richard , stopped off at Grandapolis to talk on " Unsettled Estates in the British Isles " to a woman 's club , and drew a very good crowd , including every hopeful contributor to the recurring Drake swindles . Cassie had him up to Franklin to look at an old parchment will that hung in Cobby 's office , framed and conspicuous . In its more decipherable portions an early Welles had left most of his wife 's clothing to her , with instruction that she display proper gratitude . Cobby often showed it to visiting bankers , saying that in those days women were n't getting their clutches on everything , were they ? The Colonel made something of the more obscure passages of the darkened old parchment , explained the pendent seals , estimated the probable value at a nice high figure , and becameCassie 's guest for a whole week , until Dachel , in an angry pout , moved down to the Buffalo Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had made pretty close inquiries about Cassie 's financial standing , which was around a snug million all right , but unfortunately it was mostly in investments controlled by old Susan or in trust funds , with only the income available . So she was left free to go down to the hotel to bring Dachel back . He was suchp203a help with painters and decorators out at the house , she explained , and anybody who ever had any work done would know what that meant . Hamm Rufe had other things on his mind . A note was slipped under his door , signed by the Committee for AmericanLiberty , warning him to get out of town in forty-eight hours . And Stephani wrote she was driving through next week on her way back from California , stopping off to look into Kanewa 's Midwest Farmers ' Association.  |p204FEATHERS  came drifting down along the lighted front of the Buffalo Hotel like the first flurries of a snowstorm , then thicker , settling softly upon the passers-by , who looked quickly up into the warm clear night and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High above the walk a row of hotel windows were open , with young heads hanging out and arms shaking ticking squares into the night , showering feathers downward . They shrieked with laughing as the people below brushed impatiently at their clothes and hurried past . " Hoodlums ! " the women told each other angrily , trying to cover their hair with their hands . " Young hoodlums that ought to be in the reform school  --  ! " But many of the people stopped to look up at the windows and call out words that were lost in the traffic noises , or to tell each other that it was only those school kids , celebrating Coolidge High 's victory over Alexander Hamilton School from Grandapolis . The coffee-colored doorman , student at Baptist College , held his dignified pose until the flying down got into his little mustache . Then , his sneezings echoing through the lobby , he hurried his long coattails around to find the manager . Before he got back to his station it was water in paper bags the students were dropping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , wetting down the drift of feathers along the walk . One bag hit a man in a tuxedo squarely on his bald spot and sent him , wet and swearing , into the hotel , while up in the windowsp205the laughing of the girls soared over the breaking voices of the boys . Suddenly there was a high , thin scream from among them , a plopping thud , a squeaking of metal above the street , and a girl 's frightened crying . All the crowded avenue stopped to look to a third-floor awning that moved and bellied against the red brick wall , while somebody up at the windows wailed " Sadie , Sadie ! Sadie Cooper 's fell out ! " and then was silent with the rest . The street below was still now , too , watching the struggle in the folded awning that might flatten down any moment or split open and drop the girl to the pavement . The house detective and then the manager appeared in the window belowthe girl , sticking their heads out cautiously , their faces turned upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall through , break her fool neck . The fire department was on the way ; be here in just a minute now , just a minute . On the pavement below them the doorman and a waiter came tearing out through the crowd with a big tablecloth . One at each end they stopped under the awning , looking up ; a dozen men caught the edges of the thin cloth too , and waited . With sirens going the fire department crept through the jammed traffic , grazing fenders , pushing on to the hotel . The ladder was swung up and a fireman came back with the girl , kicking and crying all the way . On the ground he set her on her feet and retreated , leaving fourteen-year-old Sadie Cooper to blink about at the crowd and stagger when she tried to move , drunk , and smelling like a prohibition still . For a moment everybody stood away from her , only the doorman thinking to help the girl inside ; then , remembering his color , he dropped his dark hands from her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of people , with half a dozen Friday-night parties . By the time the police matron and the officers arrived the sixth floor was jammed . They cleared the spectators out , but they could n't keep them from carrying away stories of furniture broken , beds torn up , piles of empty bottles , and couples of students in rooms together , some completelynaked and too drunk to dress with the law banging outside their very doors . The stories were good , and lost nothing in the swift retelling as they spread over the town . When the officers got the children sobered up a little it came out that no one was guilty of selling the minors anything to drink . They had come prepared with a crowbar to force a hotel liquor closet that Jimmy Ellers spotted long ago . It was his party ; he brought all the equipment , and a room passkey . When they got tired of the dancing down on third floor they went foraging . That 's all there was to it . Nobody knew how Sadie got through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stench , with investigations and accusations of all kinds . By the time Jimmy Ellers 's father , the ambitious attorney from the slope of Blue Ridge , got to the hotel the boy 's whole story was out . And just when Hary Ellers was hoping to move in on the Ridge itself by buying the old King place , across from Welleshaven , through Kanewa Investments . This mess would cook him with the Ridge folks , he told his wife angrily , this mess that her worthless son had stirred up . And was n't Jimmy his son also , she demanded , and was n't it to further him with the right people that the party had been planned in the first place ? This time the papers could n't sidestep the matter , not after that fool of a Sadie Cooper went and fell publicly out of a window , before a Friday-night crowd in football season . So the World puffed itself up with the pompous wrath of a Chautauqua Park camp meeting evangelist . Were these young high-school students who destroyed property so wantonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and the nation  --  even granting the excitement of a great athletic victory well won , were they typical ? Representingthe best section of the capital city as they did , mustp207they be considered worse than those of poorer environment in this city or in others offering fewer advantages ? Most certainlynot . What , then , was the younger generation coming to and where did they learn these things ? The Eddie Chimmer case , breaking so early in the fall , had already disrupted the usual campaign program of the capital city politicians . This always included a clean-up attack on the taverns and dance halls outside the city limits just before election , to get the people interested and make votes for the Franklin candidates . Sometimes the fight got hot enough to shift votes as high up as the governorship , and carrying Kanewa 's second city was important in any election . The regular plan was to wait until the university and the Baptist College students were safely settled , and then catch a country tavern selling liquor to some minor from the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually a boy from some family indebted to a politician , perhaps saved from the reformatory for this very purpose , or his sister from the industrial school . Afterward , the story was always rushed into print under approximately the same head : COUNTY TAVERNS PITFALLS FOR YOUTH . It came with such dull regularity that the assignment was shuffled off on the newest reporter , who was then called Pitfalls until the next campaign . At the time of Eddie Chimmer 's arrest he had a lot to say about venereal quacks and about jealous doctors who were afraid he would undercut them on fees for inspecting and treating the prostitutes . " But they got no call to be scared of me , " he had said , stroking his dewlap . " I would n't dirty my hands  --  " Whatever the public thought about Eddie 's hands , they wanted to know more about this prostitute trade he talked about . Where did it come from ? Surely not from within the city limits . While the World suppressed the story , the Franklin Gazette pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as elsewhere , was not necessarily evidence of more infection but probably a growing demand for treatmentthat the public could n't get . The next day the World carried a symposium by the local doctors , calling the surprisedlittle Gazette a nest of Reds who were advocating socialized medicine . After all this the edge of surprise was certainly off any clean-up for this fall . Now the women were aroused , a delegation headed by Hallie Rufer Hammond and several prominent P.T.A . ' s plowingthrough the halls of the rickety old courthouse to demandthe prosecution of the country tavernkeepers as demoralizersof the city 's youth . It was a windy day ; Hallie 's grey hair was flying , her eyes defiant , once more the daughter of old George Rufer . She got the wholesale roundup , swiftly , too , although not without a tip-off over the telephone : " Big party coming in for spring fries , " and the click of the receiver . Because the proprietors always knew the date of the regular raid , they decided this must be an extra shakedown for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many places licensed . Hell , they were family men and did n't want to keep fries around , skinny girls barely out of grade school , but they drew the older bucks . Even when a man got so he could n't do anything but look he liked a hard little butt beside his chair . So they sent a few of the younger girls home for a night or two , shifted the older ones to front service , turned the scrawniest of the high-school trade away , and scratched up what money they could , hoping the collection percentage would n't be too high . Evening brought a cold drizzle , little business , and no officers . The next night was the same , although the full moon was spilling silver over all the country parking lots , full to the gates . Maybe the telephone calls were a joke , and so to business as usual . Then Hallie Hammond got her roundup , from the proprietor of the newly opened Treasure Cave , the El Troc under another neon sign , down to the curb-servicep209girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were half a dozen bookings for liquor sales to minors , several dope charges , a candy box full of marihuana cigarettes in envelopeswith the details of each purchase , and another one of aphrodisiacs picked up around the places where the older men , some of them already smelling like wet matches , hung out . Two dozen girls were charged with soliciting , half of them under eighteen . For the first time since the government got the boy tramps off the road the Franklin County jail was filled . Before sunup it was half empty . The first one out was a marihuana peddler with a Christian Crusader button . He told the sheriff that he 'd better be taken care of or he 'd talk , and talk plenty , snarling from the corner of his mouth like in the movies . Five minutes after they let him get to a telephone the sheriff had his orders from Billie Bamper . Harold Welles 's name was one of those suppressed from the list of the detained , his arrest considered a mistake . All he did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Treasure Cave . Not recognizing the roaring machine , they shot the tires out . He claimed no knowledge of the boxes of rubber goods in the locked trunk , and denied that he was a reefer . Just had a little too much gin , got excited when he saw the officers , and jumped in the wrong car , he said . There were plenty of names that could be used , with several Polish girls from down on the bottoms among the waitresses and some WPA workers picked up as frequenters of the beer joints . Hamm was at the Snells ' the next night . The doctor was pretty cynical over his pipe . " You notice that it 's only the Polish girls they label by nationality , and the WPA workers by employer  --  " " Yes , too bad there were none they could call Jew in the catch , " Ona Snell added . " And yet those women , includingp210Hallie Hammond , are honestly trying to protect the morals of the youth of the community . " " They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hamm said , and was as surprised at the words as the doctor and his wife . " A fine political display of dirty linen , " the Grandapolis papers called the roundup . " Yeh , " the Coot agreed , " but not one breechclout of it 'll get a washing . " Hamm sat empty-handed , silent , and after a while the old man got up and went humming off to the shelterhouse . Not so much brains up there , but no mooding around like a moulting shitepoke either . It was true that even Hallie Hammond cooled a little when she saw the clean-up reach towards the Ridge . Her Rufer blood had thinned considerably in her sixty-five years of life in the capital city . Of course there was some showing for the papers ; a couple of tavernkeepers fined , their licenses revoked , and eight girls sent to the industrial school . Russ Snell told Hamm that the examining doctors found two of the girls still virgins but the officials ignored that and sent them anyway . The papers did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place was closed or that Jamie , son of Eloise Johnson , Hamm 's old girl , was put on probation to Hallie Rufer Hammond . He had been in trouble since he was eight , got kicked out of the Franklin schools with an uncle on the board of education , then out of military academy , was arrested for speeding , and finally lost his driver 's license on a hit-and-run charge . The court had tried probation to his mother and his father , and then to the judge , who was pretty sick of him . Let one of these women who thought something could be done with juvenile delinquents try a hand . In the raids seventeen-year-old Jamie was caught drunk in the back seat of a stolen car , the keys and a supply of marihuana in his pocket , and a half-dressed woman with him . The woman went to jail and Jamie got one more chance . He was to move into the large , old Hammond house with Auntp211Hallie , as the children of the Ridge called her . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours a day . As Hallie brought the boy home , the wind was moving brown leaves in waves across the Hammond lawn . He could begin at once . " First she drives my lover from me , " the platinum Eloise cried to her hairdresser , " and now she takes my son  --  " " Yeh , you got ta protect yourself from them good women  --  " the girl said through a mouthful of invisibles . But by the time her hair was set in a wealth of smooth little curls about her softening neck , and her face was out of its pack , Eloise was glad . The boy really was a problem . Took after his father 's people . The Johnsons lacked emotional stability , she said . Let Aunt Hallie look after him ; it was her fault he was n't a meek , quiet little Hammond . By this time Hamm had another letter from Stephani , impersonalas always , but good to receive . She would be detained a little , stopping on her way through Texas to look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same sort of setup as in California , and as in Kanewa too , probably . But she really was coming to see Hamm . She must know how it had been with him all these years . There was an enclosure , a letter from an acquaintance about the strike articles . " Good stuff , " the writer said . " That man Rufe is a shrewd observer , but leans too much toward the intellectual liberal , who must find good on both sides . My God ! The employers of Kanewa do n't need him to state their case . They 've got their Senator Bullard , and the public press . " Hamm asked Abigail and Carl Halzer to look into the Kanewa Farmers ' Association for Stephani 's coming . This time it was certain . The crested invitations to the Tyndale Presentation dinner were out , three hundred of them , including even a few to people from the university , the chancellor , and the deans of bizad and law . The governor was invited too , the only outstate capitol official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were some who thought he 'd never live until his successor was elected , when his resignation became effective . Big stories of the Tyndale blowout got around . Evidently Samuel had given Margaret a blank check with the world the limit . There was talk of big fights with the social director at the Buffalo Hotel , the steward and the head chef , too , and even with the manager himself , although this was obviously his biggest chance for free advertising . Every day the Tyndaleswanted something more , until he was afraid to look into a paper . No telling what screwy idea Elsa Maxwell or somebody off in Hollywood would get into print and then Margaret Tyndale would be wanting that . There was talk of roast pig , and strolling minstrels , and food from gold plates , golden china , of course , and a velvet hanging twenty feet wide with the Tyndale crest , made special for the dinner . Everybody that knew about coats-ofarmslaughed . Old Sam from Sheffield ? He must have had his made along in twenty-eight , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the country doing them for a thousand dollars each , on a fine velvet banner for the living-room wall . He left eight or a dozen behind in Franklin , better lookingthan most and without the bother of getting a line through , as Prudence Bamper pointed out . She knew ; she tried to get traced for the D.A.R . ' s , at a thousand dollars , flat rate , and had court costs on top of that because she refused to pay the professional researcher , who wanted her money whether the line went through or not . With the coat-ofarmsman there was something to show , a banner with whatever the client wanted , fleur-de-lis , plumes , armor , or anything else antique that he fancied , all combined artistically in any color scheme . But when Josina Black , the town 's genealogy expert , looked the Tyndales up , there was old Sam 's family , all right , coat-of-arms and all . In the meantime Mollie was tearing from hair stylist toCAPITAL CITY 213p213luncheon and from fitter to cocktails . She was interviewed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor for the first contribution in the Community Chest drive , greeting the Town Hall speaker , catching a plane to New York for a little shopping . Through all this Burt Parr stopped by the Co-op a time or two before his morning classes , but he never mentioned Mollie any more . Hamm could n't really say that he mentioned anything much , just sat a while , the October sun bright on his hair , and went away , his notebook rolled under his arm , his cigarette halfsmokedin his fingers . Serious matters must be coming up in the capital city , for the World was running its Culture , its C line , as the newsroom called it , this week over its editorials :  --  To envision and disseminate the highest attributes of cultural living to all the great state of KanewaIt was n't the usual agitation for the revival of the symphony , allowed to die over a WPA fight , or the complaint that music lovers had to go to Walden to hear Stokowski , where the chamber of commerce sponsored the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it was the Allerton woman backing an exhibit of oils in the chamber lounge . Not that Abigail got any credit for the show put on for National Art Week until after the trouble started . The better Franklinites always thought of themselves as patrons of the arts . Along in the 1860 's they started the old Culture Society , which broke up into reading-circle groups and the Franklin Art Association , still sponsoring exhibits of flower pictures and still-lifes . Since the war they usually bought a picture or two a year , usually cheaper ones , often by unknown artists , and some turned out good investments even in the eyes of the banker members of the association . Unfortunately they were lost in the sentimental stuff and the hundreds of bad copies they accepted to get the endowments the gifts carried . Every year the committee brought in an outside speaker , usually well-investigated . Somehow it had n't seemed necessary with the nationally famed artist son of an American first family , last year . He came , a fine bold figure of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Modestly , and almost before the last white-gloved hand was silent , he was talking of the WPA artists and the Treasury art projects that grew out of their work . The federal government had nurtured the first really creative period in American art , and one probably unequaled since the days of Athens , he said , speaking so plainly no one could help hearing every word , and understanding it all . By this time muttering greyhairedmen and women both were stalking out , for these doors , like so many in Franklin , always opened outward , and readily . The committee sent a formal note of apology to the public columns of the World , promising a more careful investigation of all speakers in the future , and pledged their opposition to any government murals in Franklin , either by the WPA or the Treasury department . There were communities in Kanewa less vigilant , Stockholm and Sheffield , for instance , and even little Minerva , far out on Wild Horse Plains , with some foreign element that praised its postoffice mural , but the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that Franklin frowned upon good art . Local exhibits , properly sponsored , were always encouraged by both the university and the chamber of commerce . Before her boycottingAbigail had arranged one for the chamber lounge , and by the time the date arrived her connection with the exhibitwas easily overlooked , Parkins , the secretary , gladly acceptingthe responsibility . Although Lon Rickert was claimed as a local boy , he was really born in a trapper 's shack on the Powder River somewhere , and grew up drawing pictures all over the buildingsp215of the cow ranch where his mother ran the cookhouse . While he studied painting at K.U. in Franklin , he worked as night chef at the Station House , humming old cowboy songs betweenclosed lips to hold off homesickness for the open country . Finally he made it as far as New York , still painting , frying steaks , and humming . About a year ago he came back to his grills at the station long enough to work up a one-man show for Harkoff 's , on New York 's East 57th Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as closemouthedabout talking when Hamm Rufe met him at Abigail 's . He liked the artist and went out with him on a few sittings , once to the home of a colored maid from the Grand Vista Country Club . They found her in a second-floor , west-side room of one of the old shacky places owned by the Kanewa Investment south of the avenue . The low ceiling was the under side of the flat rubberoid roof ; the air quivering heat ; the unscreened window sill speckled with crawling flies from the garbage cans and the open privies in the yard below . The woman was just up from a mishap , as she called it , her dark face clay-pale and glistening with sweat , her eyes set in deep secret hollows , her lips brownish soft . With her faded blue kimono held about her , she seemed somehow remote and holy , like the primitive figures Hamm saw in old Mexican churches . The artist said nothing at all , but his hands shook as he put up his easel and set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty yellow walls of a creamery beyond as a background . Hamm moved the other chair to the hallwaydoor to catch any bit of breeze , and settled down . After a while a big negro came to squat silently on his heels , watchingtoo . That would be Bo , the woman 's husband , out of work for six years . " We ca n't afford us no children , " the woman had said mildly , but as though explaining something too . Word got around of doings up at Bo 's . The audience grew . A couple of Negro women came to sit on the gaunt bed , twop216hound-ribbed little yellow boys brought a crippled baby in a goods box and leaned her against the wall to see , dropping down too , one on each side of her , motionless as rough ground metal figures . Several small white children came to stand shyly against the wall , followed later by a naked baby , his soiled diaper dragging between his creeping feet . There were soft sounds of awe and interest , even little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick of charcoal he stroked in a swift , loose sketch and then daubed it with little patches of color for later guidance , painting in only the face now , the grey skin , the quiet , sad Madonna look , and one of the hands in her lap , the palm pink and empty . Not until they were walking through the dusk of evening , the wet canvas held away from him in a double frame , did the man part his lips from their humming . " I 'll call it Bereaved Madonna , " he said . When the show opened the World gave the picture frontpagespace , with the title in quotations . There was a rush downtown to see this sacrilegious painting of the black woman , and a morning-long protest by telephone and in person to the papers , the chamber of commerce , and to Lon Rickert . It was all right if the painter wanted to choose unpleasant subject matter when portraying foreign scenes , as in his Powder River Cook , that no one knew was Lon 's own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted-up old tart standing on a box , wrapping herself in the American flag before the disinterested pretzel women , pitchmen , and the flowing street beyond . Even the portrait of old Zeromski , of the Polish bottoms , with a grey stubble over his knob of a chin , his eyes still fierce and blue , was all right , too , for it was not the capital city . But calling a Negro woman , with Glen Doover 's Franklin Creamery plainly recognizablein the background , a Madonna , that was sacrilege . But it was the picture called Capitol Vista that the town really would n't tolerate . In the background stood the whitep217tower , touched by the evening sun , and in the foreground was one of the old brick apartments on Seventh Street , with two thin , dirty children sitting on the back step , behind them a cluttered hallway and an open indoor toilet . To the protests the artist pointed out that this picture was not only true , it was factual  --  sketched from life . The chairman of the Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer that . Under normal lighting the inside fixtures would n't show . " But they are there , you know , and help make the composition  --  " the artist said . It was all really quite polite and pleasant , a matter of artistic preference , of course . Unfortunately the house committeeof the chamber had decided that the lounge must be redecorated immediately , so the pictures were taken down the next day instead of hanging the full two weeks . For days afterward old Poles from the bottoms came puffing up the stairs , repeating each time , " I see it by the paper , is pictures here . I want see  --  " Lon Rickert was disappointed , too . He had hoped to sell a few paintings , small ones , of course , not of Negro Madonnas , or of capitol vistas , but some of the pleasanter ones , to help get his show to New York . He wished now he had shown the other picture he had , the one called The Defender , of the Labor Day parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rifles , the foot of a deputy on the flag of the down bearer , three other men on the pavement , and a woman crawling away towards the paraders , who were thrown back like wheat at the first big blow of a storm . Between them and the officers , towering over all as he pulled off his blue jumper , was the defender , his hair standing like a flame and his face lightning terrible . Lon talked his troubles out with Abigail and through a newspaper man she knew in Grandapolis , he managed a show there . This time he put up all the smaller things he could getp218together , with a dozen or so hasty water colors done in Grandapolis , deliberately quaint and stylized . These he framed as quaintly : one with a dark grey sky touched to morning red over the flour mills he finished off in faded denim and the rough-sawed , wine-colored heart of a red willow tree . Some of the others he framed in burlap or cornhusks shellacked flat on old boards . " The stuff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abigail , " but I 'm afraid that 's what people here want . " The show was up ten days , and almost sold itself out , a dozen of the pictures finding their way into Franklin homes , now that it was evident that the artist 's bad showing in the capital city was all the fault of that horrible Allerton woman . Anyway , Lon had his Bereaved Madonna , Capitol Vista , and his Defender safe for his New York Show . At last the week of the Tyndale Presentation dinner came . The Sunday before there was a big barbecue and picnic out on the family homestead along the Wakoon . All the old-time friends from around Sheffield were invited , and business associatesout over the state , including a dozen or so from Franklin  --  those not quite important enough for the dinner . The barbecue fires were started at daylight for the fat baby beef , half a hog , and a sheep . The park was a hundred and sixty acres of golden October trees , with the original log house of Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community sings . Samuel made a speech and presented Mollie to their old friends , blushing and very pretty , in a sage-green suit with red fox . It was a fine day , with every Parr but Burt there , and all the other old-timers who knew Mollie from her diaper days . The Co-op kept Hamm so busy he saw nothing of Burt Parr or anyone else much . Then along about two o'clock one morning when the sky had cleared from a fog and drizzling ,  |p219he  was awakened by a light , timid rattling at his door , like a field mouse trying to get in from the cold . It seemed higher up , and was so persistent that at last Hamm put on his robe and went to see . It was Mollie Tyndale , holding up her long velvet cloak in both hands , her hair flying , her face bloodstreakedand dirty , her pretty sandals clay-caked . She had to get to Burt . No , no , she was all right , but she had to find Burt . Hamm saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he coaxed her inside and called a student who knew of Burt 's hours and places . Then he built up a good fire and while the girl shivered before it he cleaned her little satin sandals , making a great fuss over the job to give her time for calm . At last the girl began to talk , slowly , and what she omitted Hamm could well fit in from the shock of her girl face . The evening had started like any other cold , damp fall night . After the dinner for her at the Buffalo a dozen of them made the rounds of the town , ending up at the Country Club for a dance or two , from there to Milo Groves 's apartment for another drink and then home . Somehow Harold Welles got her away from her crowd and into the Doover car with Frankie 's new girl , Sadie . Frankie 's girls were usually just Sadie or Zella or LaVerne , nothing else , but generally good fun and all right . Harold suggested they do something different tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a couple of blocks off the campus that he thought he could get into . Oh , a lowdown place all right , but O.K. for an afterhourbeer , and a look at the crumby people . The rest thought the idea grand , so Mollie went , not objecting too much . She never liked Frankie and Harold 's whitish eyes gave her chills , especially lately . But one could n't be a mudball all the time . Leaving the car half a block away , they went stumbling over the sunken walk to a dark old frame house on an empty , unlighted street . On the porch Mollie really tried to holdp220back but Harold kept on knocking a complicated tattoo on the thin door . Finally there was a commotion far away , a shuffling as of slippers , a yawning , and a man 's voice asking " What-you-want  --  ? " running the words all together , like some foreigner . " Friends of J. W. 's , " Harold said low , his mouth against the door crack . Mollie wondered about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of the Gold Shirts , a convict and blackmailer , some people said . After a little rattling the door opened and Mollie was pushed ahead into the darkness . None of the rest hesitated at all , Sadie giggling a little as the door closed behind her and a small flashlight clicked on , swept over their faces , and was shut off . " O.K. , " the man said like any American , and they followed his steps over a long bare floor into an inside room , lit by a smoky lamp and smelling of an oil heater . The room was dark to their eyes , even after the blackness of the hallway ; the walls water-streaked and dirty . Four or five people , men and women , sat around a wet old dining table drinking canned beer . They looked up at the newcomers , their mouths open a little , keeping their hands on the grey cans as though they were rocks , ready for defense . One of the women laughed out loud at Mollie 's face . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shut up , Belle , " the man beside her snapped , drawing his thick arm back with the can in his fist , and winking heavily to Mollie . The girl looked swiftly about her , but neither of the boys , not even Sadie , seemed surprised at the dirty room or the loose-faced drinkers . They pushed her on at the heels of the thin , stooped man beckoning from another dark hall . " Right this way , Buddy , " he said , businesslike , switching the flashlight on again , and leading the way down a chicken ladder of steps into a long narrow hallway , wet and stale with a queer , sickly , sweetishness smell . Mollie pulled backp221again . " Let 's go , please , Harold , let 's go home ! " she begged . " Sh  --  sh , " he ordered , and nudging her , pointing out the necking couple on a narrow bench at the end of the hall . " Waiting for another round  --  " he whispered , laughing a little , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mollie noticed dark openings along the left side of the hall , half a dozen of them , with the man stopping at one after another to listen . At a silent one , he flashed his light inside and she saw a bare space hardly a foot wider than the iron bed , with an old grey blanket bunched on the dirty mattress . " There ya are , payment in advance , fifty cents fer fifteen minutes  --  " the man said , waving Harold in . At that Mollie got very sick . Clapping her hand over her mouth , she jerked free , and ran back into the darkness towards the stairs , the man behind her whispering loudly , " Catch her ! You damn fools , bringin ' a runnin ' drunk in. here  --  Catch the broad ! " Just as the man 's flashlight found her Mollie stumbled against a door . It shot open at her weight . Probably for use in raids , she guessed . Hamm nodded . Well , she fell through it , out into cold , fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to the ground level and began to run down the middle of the dark street . Almost at once she knew that this would n't do , not now that her face seemed to be bleeding and her knees skinned . So she slowed down , walking along the muddy curb as though coming home from a girl friend 's . She had no mad money with her ; the buses had long stopped ; no taxis cruised the streets , not even a car . She was alone in the silent , sleeping town . So she came here . By the time Burt Parr roared up to the shack in a borrowed car , Mollie was quieter , her bruised forehead washed , her skinned knee taped . When she saw the boy in the doorway , his tousled hair shining in the light , his eyes deep and black , she ran sobbing into his arms . . . .  | Early the next morning Hamm had a call for Burt Parr . Where was the young fellow and the car he borrowed the night before ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day and about the miserable son Cobby Welles had fathered , Cobby , the friend of his boyhood . Perhaps there was something to the story the Coot told around the shelterhouse , about the fake Canadian war hero . Maybe there was more than gossip to these stories about the woman Cobby had married . Hamm thought of Burt Parr , with his hair bright as any Polish girl 's from the bottoms , his shoulders broad and fine as the walnut beams old Jacob cut in the early timber of the Wakoon , and he wondered how Margaret Tyndale would take the jolt her fine plans might get today . In the evening he found the boy waiting for him in the shack , hunched over his knees on the edge of the couch , his face in his palms . Hamm put the coffeepot on and spread a thick round of ham in the frying pan . Finally Burt began to talk . They had gone across the state line to Parson Sam , the Marryin ' Man . It had seemed so right last night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time the boy was silent , his hands working , his eyes tight closed against his cheeks . Then slowly he started to talk again . This morning , when they got back , it was all different , with Mollie 's mother crying that he had spoiled everything , their lives , the trip to England , the Presentation dinner . Yes , Hamm thought , angrily , she would put it so , the dinner the climax , the most important of all . So now it was all done , like the fine tall trees standing over the Wakoon and suddenly undermined by the river . Nothing left but Mollie looking back over her mother 's shoulder as they took her away . They were beginning annulment proceedings . Samuel had hurried down to the little inland town to suppress the publication of the marriage . Chartered a plane , Hamm supposed.  |p223No  , Mollie 's father had intended to , but Burt convinced him that the publicity would make suppression impossible . Now he wished he 'd let the old show-off fly down there ; , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend made him ashamed . " Samuel Tyndale was n't like this down home , " he said through his fingers . " I do n't know . Something 's happened  --  " Yes , things do happen to people , Hamm admitted . And all this was quite a complication , with the Presentation dinner only a couple of days away . So he pulled his bed up , got the boy 's shoes off , and stretched him out . When Halzer came by on the way to Abigail 's for a cup of coffee , Hamm went out to send him on alone . He could n't leave the boy , not tonight , to wake up to an empty shack . The next day the paper had a half column of further plans for the Tyndale dinner , with a solid paragraph of out-oftownguests , in agate for the first edition but hastily reset in larger type for the city . Nothing else . Hamm looked over to Burt , hunched at the foot of the couch , as though he had been so all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still seem to be a married man . And every day of delay means just that much more chance of the family getting used to the idea  --  " But seeing the boy 's face he fell silent , and when Burt finally got into his coat to go to his room , Hamm made an errand to walk at his side . At the door he put his arm across the young shoulder . " Mollie is the one you must think of , " he said . The boy nodded , and slowly went inside . The Presentation dinner made three columns in both local papers , with a ten-inch cut of Mollie in a white satin gown , her second in two months , the office girls and the clerks of the town told each other . In her soft black curls stood the three white plumes of presentation , and at her heels swept the court train . The floral piece , eight feet high , was three curled plumes , too , made of white chrysanthemums on gold and blue , small ones for corsages at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a long string of costumed viand bearers led by a plump , red-faced man carrying the roast pig on a mammoth pewter platter . They marched around the entire room singing . Some doubt had arisen at the university over the authentic songs for such an occasion , and in impatience Margaret had the bearers learn one she remembered from old Samuel of Sheffield :  --  Then round the board , And fill the cupAnd pile the viands high ! There was some arguing over these words , too , and over the tune , but it really went very well , with enough applause to take a second round , the bearer of the pig getting noticeably weary in the arms . But it was something to see in Franklin , in all of Kanewa . Finally , the minstrel had sung his last song , the dancers , the tumblers , and the jester were gone , and the ink was dry on the last signature of the guest book . When the door closed behind the Tyndales , the hotel people dropped wherever they happened to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's three grandmothers , who were seated on the only scheme of ranking they never resented , by age , thought so . Everybody , literally everybody , except Harold Welles and a few of his lot , was there . When somebody teased Mollie , asking about Harold 's absence from her big party , she answered , " Oh , he had more important business on tonight . " She said it lightly enough , everybody knowing his important business , usually up on the hill in Stone House , and yet there was something about her face that brought a look or two among the older guests and a wondering to Hallie Hammond . There was something special behind Harold 's absence , she thought , from the look thosep225who were Gold Shirts gave each other . Could it be that they were stirring up the old story she heard years ago about Old Samuel , the first , the settler from England ? It was said he or his wife was Jewish , a quarter or something , by people who could n't stand up against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , meaning a close trader . Certainlythere was nothing to suggest it in the Samuel before them here , with his blunt nose and thin sandy hair . It was true that Mollie 's dark hair lay in fine , soft curls , obviously natural , compared to those of Marylin or Helen Groves , or the others about her . But before the Presentation dinner was done , the ineffectual Harold Welles and his Gold Shirts took on more importance in Hallie Hammond 's eyes , and perhaps in the eyes of the lesser people there , too , especially those who felt the pinch of Samuel 's competition , although no word of all this was made for anyone to hear . Almost immediately those who had been to the Presentation dinner found their stories so much weak tea compared to one that was going the rounds of the town . It seemed that a finger waver named Sadie who considered herself Frankie Doover 's girl friend was telling her following that Mollie ran out on Harold Welles at a cat house last week . Right from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep her customers patient under the drier . And each time she improved it , adding the explanations and details the previous customer demanded , until it was a lengthy , hilarious narrative , with women from the other booths slipping up to the lavender curtain to hear . " I thought I 'd spring a leak right there in public  --  laughing ! " Sadie always ended , holding her sides . " I mean , " she corrected , " when Frankie told me about Mollie seeing the crib Harold was takin ' her to  --  ! " Even those who considered the Tyndales pushing outsidersp226and their scandals of secondary importance were interested in the story because it included a Welles . First that Cobby , who 'd been keeping a Polak girl in an apartment for years , taking poison ; Cassie openly bringing a gigolo home from California ; and Marylin chasing around over the state after a red-necked farmer who had been in jail for disturbance and rioting . Now it was Harold too . That business of running with the Gold Shirts was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only not so harmful , maybe a little more like boy scouting for older fellows . But nobody from the Ridge should go sneaking off to places that could be so exaggerated by a girl like that Sadie from the beauty parlor . And her claiming it was right here in town ; everybody knew that was a lie . Such talk should be hushed , forcibly , if necessary . It broke down respect for their class and for their city . Anybody who wondered how Margaret Tyndale was taking all this could see for herself . In a flippant new hat that reared up from her head like a double swallow 's wing she was out every day , to club meetings , bridge parties , taking her exercises . Not even when the whisperers about her got careless did she take an extra drink or seem to smoke one more cigarette . She made one friend that bad week  --  Hallie Rufer Hammond , who remembered when these same people were whispering so about her first-born son , still called a slacker and a coward among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand to see her mother adjust the calm of her face as she would a hat to go out and know that she , herself , was to blame for it all . Once the girl tried to go downtown and came running back to escape the coyote eyes of the people on the street , and maybe all of them knowing how it was with Burt , all except she . But when Mollie tried to talk of these things to her mother , Margaret kissed her daughter and told her she must run , positively run , for that fitting . So finally the girl drove down to the Tyndale parking lotp227and slipped into her father 's office by the back way . Somewherein the man behind the heavy , hand-hewn walnut desk from the Wakoon was the father who used to make willow whistles for her and Burt , so long ago  --  whistles that had holes along the sides for their small fingers . Then he would hold one to the side of his mouth and pipe out a merry little ditty as he tapped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today it was the Samuel Tyndale of big conferences , of important man-business . He gave his daughter another signed blank check and sent her away . There must be some things to finish up her wardrobe for England . " Oh , Dad  --  " the girl cried . But he took her through his waiting room and held the outside door for her , very grand . " Amuse yourself , my dear ! " he called gaily after her . So she waved back and gathering her coat about her ran through the big outer office , the eyes of all the clerks lifted to her face , although the heads seemed bowed in diligence . Not that the day had been an easy one for Samuel . Mollie was the second woman he had sent away this afternoon . Half an hour earlier Grayce Adams Smith had talked her way into his office , with her lady ways , her soft grey hair . But when she asked Samuel Tyndale for hush money he rose , short , solid , and stocky against her . " Dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town are  --  buzzards ! Tell it that Mollie is secretly married . Yell it up and down the streets . She is one you ca n't touch , for she is alive . " It was n't long before Hamm heard about Sadie 's businessgettingstory . An old Polander whose daughter worked at the beauty shop came up to tell him . Maybe it be better for American young fellow to know . " The Welles is a no-good people for girls  --  " the old carpenteradded thoughtfully over his pipe . Yes , it looked that way , Hamm admitted.  | " Anyhow , your friend Burt , he can feel happy . His girl , she get away . " Hamm found the boy 's room empty , no one in it since the day before , the fat landlady said . They did n't know anything at the filling station either , and the manager did n't like it . Tyndale employees arc dependable and reliable , he said . Hamm agreed , and let the man talk on while he called up everyone he could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next morning there was news on the radio and in the paper . Young Burt Parr had been found in Dakers woods , beyond the old Chautauqua grounds . He was tied to a tree , a gag in his mouth , his back blood-crusted and swollen from a clubbing , with three teeth knocked out and his jawbone broken from a kick in the face . The Franklin papers minimized the incident as student hazing , a little extreme , to be sure , as hazings sometimes were . But the Grandapolis Inquirer gave it front-page coverageas one more blot of violence upon the honor of the capital city . They ran the photograph of Burt , face down on a hospital bed , his jaw strapped tight , his back scarred and dark , writing his story on a scratch pad under his hand . Night before last when he was coming home to his room a man in a car drew up alongside and asked for a direction . When young Parr turned to give it , he was hit over the head , a cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boot kick in the mouth he got out in the woods when he put up a fight . But there were five against him and so they tied him to a tree , his arms around the trunk , and took turns pounding his back with any clubs they could find until they were played out . One of them came back and struck a match to his hair , but it was so wet with sweat it only made a stench . At the question of a reason the injured man had hesitated , then wrote his reply on the scratch pad : " One told me it was to teach me to keep away from other people 's women . " CAPITAL CITY 229 " Had you ever heard the voice before ? " " Yes . " " Anyone connected with campus affairs ? " " No . " " So , " the crusading reporter wrote , " tied and gagged , and suffering from the brutal beating and from exposure , young Parr was found two days later by the barking dog of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the man Burt accused , although it was known from Blue Ridge to Herb 's Addition . It was omitted from the records at the courthouse , too , for of course Burt Parr was not himself today , after the exposure and all . It was not until late in the afternoon that anyone seemed to get past the story of the whipping far enough to discover that on page four a Wolfgang B. Parr figured in a Margaret Beaconsfield Tyndale marriage annulment suit , filed late the day before . Even then it did n't mean much until the telephoninggot started , and the talk over the cocktails . Was n't that Mollie the sly one ? So slim and cool and poised under her plumes at the Presentation dinner , and secretly married to a filling-station attendant all the time . That he was also a childhood playmate , and the grandson of an old friend of the first Tyndale of Sheffield , was n't mentioned . He was a pauper and the marriage was secret , and that generally meant something , the Franklinites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in Eddie Chimmer 's book too , if he was n't having to step pretty careful just now . Still , somebody must have helped her , or they would n't be annulling it , the older woman said , remembering Cassie when she was young . Then there was the story about her going to that place with Harold Welles . Was that supposed to be before or after she was married ? And what about Burt Parr being tied to a tree ?  | Hamm went to see the boy as soon as he could get away . The nurse was doubtful about visitors , but Burt heard his voice at the door and banged against the iron of the bed until she let him in . A long time Hamm Rufe stood over his young friend , on his stomach on a sort of slide , the fine young body awkward and wooden in its swollen bandages , his free eye dark and angry , the thick blond hair clipped off close . To Hamm it was as though this injured boy were his son , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark violence from some far-back Rufer throbbing under his jaw . With his uncalloused hands he could have crushed the throats of those from the Stone House . But in a moment it was gone and he was empty , his hands slack weight against his thighs . He must make some words for Burt , careful words , letting out nothing of the annulment . So he asked of the night in the woods , pulling the slips off the pad as Burt filled them . But finally the boy wrote Mollie 's name , and Hamm promised him he 'd see her if he could . Then he nodded to the nurse hovering about the door and went away . Back at Herb 's Addition he pulled out his typewriter and set to work with the small sheaf of notes from the boy 's pad . It was the Gold Shirts , of course , with Milo Groves and Harold , the two he would recognize , mostly standing off outside the light from the car that was turned on him and the tree . Neither of them talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy 's hair . Hamm suspected that there must have been some good scratches and bites left from the tussle at the foot of the old cottonwood , some nice dun-colored shirts torn to rags , evidence enough for the officers , if any was wanted . Sheet after sheet he ripped from his typewriter and towards morning he set the alarm and went to bed , the final draft of " The Ripening Fascism of the Corn Belt " ready for the mail.  |p231While  the papers saw nothing serious in the attack on Burt Parr it was too good material for the politicians to pass by . In less than twenty-four hours Charley Stetbettor had come blaring down Philadelphia Avenue in his sound truck , damning the university for its refusal to let him use the fieldhouse , and calling on everyone to attend his meeting in the old auditorium . People stopped along the street to listen , in cars and afoot , or turned in behind him , to follow . In the dingy old grey building where Bryan once addressed the hopeful and cheering Populists , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced bribemakingrailroads , Charley Stetbettor plunged into his incoherenttirade . He attacked the morality of the city , the state , and the nation . With Communists in the government and Jews running the country , young men were openly taking under-age girls across the state line for immoral purposes . In these times there was a crying need for more strong young defenders of the flag and sacred American womanhood ! When a heckler pointed out that Burt Parr had married the girl he took across the state line , three husky young fellows came swinging down from the front rows . They grabbed the man and rushed him to the door amid cheers and stomps and boos . When the three had returned to their seats old Charley Stet went on , his hoarse voice rising and falling in short , staccato rhythms , ending up by calling upon God and all the lovers of the flag to preserve America for Americans , Amen . The next evening Senator Bullard spoke from the same platform , asking a return to the good old days of Harding and Coolidge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workingmenand farmers in the back told each other . Senator Hanson passed through town on his way to Washingtonand was asked to speak , too , by a few hopefuls . They 'd get the fieldhouse for him . No , he said , his wide , slow smile breaking up his craggy face ; he would n't need anything bigger than a telephone booth to hold his audience in Franklin . The things happening here could n't happen if that were not true . So the papers wrote editorials against him , calling him " Kanewa 's Senior Senator , who has no time for anyone from his home state except every sixth year , and this is n't the year . " But they were wrong , for he had asked Hamm Rufe to meet his train and come as far as Grandapolis to tell him something of the situation in Franklin . He knew a great deal about Hamm 's writing , said he had a fairly complete scrapbookof his articles on Kanewa 's Co-operatives , and the state 's labor and farm problems . At Kohl Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The farmer was diffident before the sharp , wrinkle-nested eyes of the old Scandinavian liberal . But when they had considered him a disconcerting minute , the brown skin about them crinkled . " Sit down , young man , " he said , " and let us hear the Bull of Bashan bellow ! "  |p233THE  fall was a long , dry taste of ragweed to the tongue . For weeks dust lay like fog over the highways , the goldenrod alongside weighed down with its powdering , the sun setting as through smoke . Then two days of a leaning wind cleared the air , swept the scattered trees naked as dead November , and cracked the earth around the new wheat . In the cornfieldsthe shucking teams moved at a steady walk , with now and then a nubbin clattering desolately against the bangboard . Down in the capital city the shadows were lengthening early across Philadelphia Avenue , and a small grey wind collectedbits of paper into deserted doorways , many empty since the Harding days . A stray corn leaf zigzagged along the walk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattle , and then turned to pursue it , pecking . The men who had hung along the empty buildings all day began to move , stiffly at first , their backs bent in protection upon themselves , then hurried away as evening deepened . Along the curb the gold and purple banners of the city of Franklin came down , the office workers thinned on the streets , only the retail clerks staying behind to get the unsold stock back on the shelves . Another Fall Dollar Day was done . Tomorrowthe nation 's chiropractors would begin to drift in , and next Thursday the bankers for their state convention . It was fortunate that the half a dozen business buildings had new fronts or the old sandblasted , that the excavation for the Schendler annex , seven stories , was well started . A big hole in the ground always draws a crowd , makes things look good , Parkins , the secretary of the chamber of commerce , was supposed to have said . Yes , good for those who wo n't get beyond bankers ' row on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin papers had disposed of the attack on Burt Parr as a student hazing , but outstate , in the rawer regions , papers like the Minerva Thunderbolt took a serious view , as did many as far away as Des Moines and Denver . Even in the capital city some of the more thoughtful were disturbed , particularly around the university . But with one dean writing for the giveaway insides that Cole Dringer was distributing to the country press , and the son of another a known Gold Shirt , talk among the best of friends became a little formal and constrained , even the oldest cronies fearing the solvent action of the secret glass of beer , secret though legal , because out-of-job Ph.D . ' s were thick as rabbits in a brush pile . Some of the League of Women Voters , like Hallie Rufer Hammond and Ona Snell , who tried to get up an organized demand for an investigation found themselves labeled Reds by the local patriots . One whole issue of the Christian Challengerwas devoted to the Dupes of the Red Agents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , but the chamber delegated Cees to intercede with his mother , and so the matter was dropped as bad for business , with the market down just now anyway . Through all this Hamm remembered the injured boy 's parents at the hospital the night after he was found . They were a quiet , shabby pair , soft and well-spoken . There had been no tears , no anger while they were with Burt . The only complaint at all was outside , on the walk , when the two had thanked Hamm for his friendship to their son in the capital city . " Our people fled to America from oppression , " the father said slowly . " But now there is nowhere to go . "  |p235Hamm  shook his head . No , there was nowhere to go . Great-grandfather Joseph Pahr had fought tyranny in his homeland at the risk of his life and not until the very last hope was gone did he flee to America . Now , if no land of refuge remained , there was certainly no taste for battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still seemed worth a fight in Madrid , Warsaw , in China , and in the industrial regions of America , where men died readily enough for such a matter-of-fact thing as the right to a decent way of work . Freedom had been worth a struggle in this transMississippiregion in the Populist days , even in 1917 , to the western liberals who faced an ostracism less merciful than a swift shot between the shoulder blades . But those men were dying off , for even such virility is mortal , and none were comingup to take their places . Perhaps it was as the Coot always said , and worse ; perhaps the midwestern capital cities were not only parasites , but poisonous parasites , insinuating their paralysisinto the bodies of their states to affect the sons of the Joseph Pahrs out on the far rivers as well as those of the George Rufers within their limits . The Gold Shirts were n't out around town much for a few days after the tree affair , probably been tipped off to let the matter die . " Got word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , " Al Jackson , Franklin 's one Communist , told his chair neighbors at the city library , where he spent all his evenings . Some recalled that it was the exact expression used by the town 's Tories against Al when he backed the movement for a non-political unicameral legislature several years ago , because old Ben Franklin had favored a one-house congress . Of course , the idea got nowhere in Kanewa , even with Stalin backing it , as Franklinites pretended to believe . Now there was talk that Willper , the commander of the Gold Shirts , had busted Harold Welles for unauthorized action , put a young German import into his place , and thatI Harold was pretty sore  --  a Welles being disciplined by that ex-convict . In the meantime the dark-suited young men with the enameled cross and sword of the Christian Crusaders in their lapels suddenly seemed to be everywhere , on the street , in church , at football games and political gatherings . They were probably trying to justify the money spent on them , too , Abigail Allerton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get all the publicity . Flaming crosses had been appearing on the capitol and the courthouse lawns , burning into the morning . Only this time the town 's Catholics and its scattering of Negroes were told it was the Samelly Finesteins and the strikers that the night riders were after . " Just so much American hokey-pokey , " an old cowman in to buy up ranch mortgage bonds said . " An ' wo n't last no longer than it did back when we used to sneak a little of the stuff on an old crow bait to make ' er buck  --  " Others dismissed it as so much American joinerism , an infantilefondness for secret lodges and regalia . But there were some , even in the city club , like Mona Stone , who could n't pass it off so easily . She had spent many weeks of the last two years at her radio , dialing the short-wave stations , sometimes her lovely , angular face strained to gauntness , a desperation in her black-lashed blue eyes as her Jewish mother fled from Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother wrote so cheerfully as she had before Anschluss , before Munich and before Danzig . Now , she was in America at last and the same thing was coming here , even in the quiet little midwestern capital city , which did seem to disseminate the cultural standards for the state , as it so proudly claimed . But at the fall opening of the city club Mona was slim and calm as ever in silver lame and larkspur-blue velvet beside her husband , John Stone , who was capital city attorney for the Grandapolis Power . Often she wondered about the company and its campaign contributions , assessed by the eastern directors  --  were these really only for the anti-labor ,  |p237anti-|public  power fight , or was it going farther , deeper ? Twice she had asked John to return to his little practice in Baltimore , but he refused . Perhaps she would n't mind living small again , but he was determined to climb , he told her bluntly , alone if necessary . So Mona Stone played bridge with Cassie Welles and others of importance from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the rounds of the tables . One day two men in brownish drill uniforms , polished black belts shining , came to Abigail 's door . They said they were from outstate and had come up to talk about her book . The moment they were in her place they started off with what they called the inside dope on the great Jew conspiracy to deliver America into the hands of the Communists . It was horrible to listen to them  --  like living in the world of her George , who came back from war forever bedeviled by conspiring enemies , the only refuge from them the cabbage patch at the mental hospital . Yet here were two men who talked just like George , but free to gallop in excitement up and down her rug , through its bright patch of Kanewa sunshine . The taller , darker of the two tried to thrust mimeographeddiagrams into her hands , pointing to this and that statement as proof of the financial domination of the country by Jew bankers . And when she asked them to give her the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one got loud , his mouth opening wide and red . " We 're again Jew lovers just as much as the damn Jew himself ! " he roared out in warning . A moment Abigail looked the two men over , from their puttees to the campaign hats , dented , flat-brimmed , still on their heads , setting far back . She opened her door wide , stood beside it , waiting . The taller man started out , protesting a little . " Hell , lady , my buddy do n't mean you no harm  --  we was just getting signers for a boycott of the Jews in this town , the big fellows , like Greenspan and Plaska and them , them that you ai n't got no more cause to love than we got  --  " pulling a thick , folded petition from his pocket , opening it . " Has n't anyone told you  --  " Abigail demanded , " that I 'm an American citizen , and believe in the Bill of Rights ? " " We ai n't holdin ' no truck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid on the Constitution an ' we 're against them Reds and Jews . " Abigail had to laugh at that . " You should read the Constitutionsome time  --  " Then her anger rose . " Get out  --  get out ! " They went , the fat one sullenly , turning back at the landing . " You 're a goin ' to be damn sorry about this some day ! " " Yeh , gon na be in a bad spot  --  " the other added . Then they fell into conspicuous step and marched down the stairs , their boots clumping as one heavy pair . Out on the walk they looked up at her windows , as though marking it in their minds , and then went on to the next house , where Abigail had often seen the caretaker and his friends slip out through the dusk of the alley with their arms full of white stuff , like bundled-up sheets , or perhaps regalia . When the men were finally gone Abigail was limp . It seemed inconceivable that this was what her America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the long , long struggle since the first brown-skinned hunter crossed the Bering region and set his foot southward ; doubly inconceivable in this capital city , built by such seekers after freedom and the good life as old George Rufer , the city that still held itself up as the model of culture to all the state of Kanewa . The next day Abigail saw the two men again . She was comingdown the postoffice steps , across from the side entrance to the old American Bank building . Together the two turned in and she wondered , for the building had been empty sincep239the Blockert scandal , years ago . But when she got around to the front a wide sign was going up over the door :  --  DR . C. THURSTON STE1BETTORFOR GOVERNORWhatever the builders of the town might say to it if they were here now , at least this fall the capital city was n't dull , really almost as exciting as back before the World War , when the suffragettes were getting themselves clubbed and jailed , and the disapproving W.C.T.U. finally outdid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyndale-Welles-Parr talk , a two-day stream of women not invited to the Presentation dinner had passed through the Buffalo Hotel to see the floral piece , set up in the lobby in the moisture of a salad stand sprayer from one of the Tyndale stations . It made the lobby clammy as a bath house and brought complaints from eastern traveling men , but it drew local trade . Even those who did n't get down to the hotel had seen Mollie 's picture in the papers , fine in her long sweeping train and plumes , a girl born on a dirt road , outside of a small town , just like anybody . Then there was the annulment suit , and Burt Parr found tied to a tree . To be sure the radio newscaster who made the story as exciting as a scene from Gang Busters was suspended , not for that , but because he said the culprit was " a vengeful enemy of the more favored suitor of a local duchess of Kanewa . " That made it plain enough , even before the Grandapolis papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty parlor , and Harold Welles not at the Presentation dinner that night . The International Contract Club , experts in bridge and on court etiquette , were divided on the presentation matter . A married woman could n't be presented at court , the cousin of a state-department clerk said very definitely . " Why not ? " the others demanded . " Well , she ca n't . Look at the Duchess of Windsor  --  " " But that is n't the same at all . It was the H.R.H. that Davie demanded for Wallie , something much different  --  " a woman who once saw Queen Victoria corrected . Unfortunately everyone had heard about that , and so the conversation jumped on to middle Franklin 's notion of the attitude of the Church of England on annulments , before and after it changed on divorce . But the woman who had lived in England raised her voice , as was her right . Had n't she seen the Prince of Wales ride in the park , she asked , and been patted on the head by a maharaja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making her seem old lately . About the church attitude she was firm . Yes , it had changed on both annulments and divorce . But the cousin of the state-department clerk was still against married women . Anyway , court was n't much , these days . By the time Burt was out of the hospital , the interest in the Tyndale stories had passed on like a patch of shadow from a brick wall . The collector of White House stories could get a hearing again , and middle Franklin was playing bridge for drinks and points once more . Weeks before the hunting season opened there was always a lot of big outdoor man talk all over the capital city , at the clubs , the pool halls , and clear down to Old Horsemeat 's . Enough ammunition for a little war was ordered , and all the season 's new gadgets and hunting clothes , including dozens of pairs of hip waders to smell up the hot attics of summer for years and probably never get wet unless the roof leaked . Fine shotguns were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police station , to have the grease taken out that he put in a year ago . Arrangements were made around the hay coun/try for the prairie oyster fries at the ranches up north of the Grand . Liquor purchases were approached like hydroelectric deals . Those from Blue Ridge stocked their hunting shacks with hard liquor by the case and beer the dozen cases through Groves , Wholesale Groceries ; many of those above just picking up a little on the way out into the country dickered with Al " Better-than-Wholesale " Faber . The serious hunter who really wanted to fill out a bag of pheasants , or mallards , or maybe get a Canada goose or two , had to plan carefully . Huntingfatalities often ran as high as six or eight on opening day in Kanewa , and before a week the game , never too plentiful , was shy as any lone antelope that had had his tail clipped by a bullet . Every year Horsemeat got to tell his customers that the fool who 'd pull a gun barrel first out of a car or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else . With each hunting license he sold he threw in a little advice : " Keep your gun pointed in the ground , and never depend on that Goddamn safety . Better file it off . It ai n't never on nohow except when you got to make a quick shot . " This year opening day brought its usual casualties to the capital city . Before noon a shoe clerk out his first time stumbled over some down sunflowers and shot his girl in the heel . Around four o'clock there was a more serious radio news flash . Archie Greenspan , manager of four of Franklin 's moving-picture theaters , was found dead , shot in the back . He never drank , always went out with little Pete Mario , running a west-end pool hall , and while rough enough , a teetotalertoo . This afternoon Pete came roaring up to a filling station out at Liberty well ahead of his dust , but when he got his car jammed to a stop , he just sat there . " Call the sheriff , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice . " Archie Greenspan 's been shot . " The row of Sunday loafers along the stucco station let their chair legs drop , pushed their hats back . By God , the little runt was a crying. 242 CAPITAL CITYp242So the sheriff , with a dozen loafers following along , went out with the man . " I knowed I did n't dare move him , so I leaves him , but he 's dead all right  --  dead  --  " Twice Pete looked from the road to the sheriff sitting beside him . " You ai n't thinkin ' I done it , are you ? I would n't kill him , not my buddy in the War  --  " But even way out here on Long Grass Creek the sheriff knew that Pete was an ex-convict and before that fact his twenty-five years of peaceful citizenship and his war medal were nothing . When the story first got on the radio it was called a huntingaccident . Next time it was murder . " Prominent movie house manager hit in back with a load of heavy shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , the Franklin papers could let go . Pete was the son of an Italian immigrant from the Colorado beet fields . He had been in the penitentiary as an accomplice in a holdup . He always denied any connection with it . " I was just killing time at the drugstore ; slack season and nothing to do . How I can know two fellows from little Italy gon na come in and shoot up the place ? " The authorities comforted him with the reminder that he got the shortest sentence of the three . When war broke out he was paroled in time to enlist , and came back to Franklinwith Archie Greenspan , from the same company , and friends ever since . Pete was rough in his talk , but no more than the rest of the boys when they came back . The unfortunatecompany they were thrown with , everybody said , toughs from the city slums and the ranch country , and immigrantlaborers . Pete never got over it , but his little pool hall was orderly enough , a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowling alley that the women 's teams liked . Pete always looked in on them during the evenings , making friendly comments , remembered what everybody rolled the last time and even the time before that . He was a bachelor , and whenever some new acquaintancep243asked kiddingly why he never got married he rubbed his thick palm over his bald head in embarrassment . If he was pushed for a reply he would say , " Marry ; me ? Can you ask a decent woman to marry a convict ? " Then usually he 'd walk away to the back somewhere and the kidder would feel pretty mean . Now little Pete was down in jail , for shooting his hunting partner , his war buddy . " The dirty Jew had it comin '  --  " Willper from Stone House was reported to have said , and it was no secret that the manager of the other two theaters thought so too . Archie Greenspan had been hard competition . He had a good racket getting important people out to midnight previews of pictures he thought might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and As You Like It . He was the one who had brought Carnival in Flanders to the little show-house off the avenue , fair time . He managed to make something from them all , even the Flanders , because he could talk people , doctors , professors , even Abigail Allerton , into saying something about them . " Your recommendation will mean much to the people who do n't frequent ordinary pictures and might otherwisemiss this , " he always told them . His competitor tried the system , asked the Dr. Spells and Abigail to a preview of Made for Each Other , and was furious when they told him their opinion . It must be that damn oily Jew way of Greenspan that got around people . Well , now he was shot to hell and gone . There were people who wondered what Pete 's story would be . It came , thin as wet cigarette paper and about as strong . He said they had n't scared up more than a mangy rabbit all day and so they tried their usual trick when game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sure to run into a flock of pheasants tearing off through the grass in every direction , and only one gun . Pete had n't found anything when he heard a shot boom mighty hollow off in Archie 's direction , so he went over . He did n't see anything of him at first , not until he almost fell over the man , face down in the weed patch below the Johnson field , where they 'd got many a bag before . The sheriff reported that he found Pete 's gun clean as chromium inside , but he always carried a felt-tipped ramrod with him . Said he was choicy of his gun , learned to be in the army . Even cleaned it after trying out those new highpowershells at a target on the way out that morning . Oh , there was no doubt about it , Pete was guilty , all right . So they took him away to the Franklin jail , more room there , and Joe Manders , a young deputy from Liberty with FBI notions , got a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked the ground over . From the tracks , Manders decided that the dead man was knocked forward as though he 'd been hit with a doubletree in the back of the neck . So he started in a straight line , down the shot , looking the ground over carefully at every step . Far back , in the moist earth of a patch of tall horseweeds , he found two heavy tracks with some fainter ones leading off across the sod towards the graveled road ; nothing else , not even the empty shell . When the crowd was gone , the deputy made casts of the footprints , one clear , the other with the heel lost on the grass . They were of broad , flat shoes , like those he used to wear when a boy  --  Sears , Roebuck 's cheapest split cowhide , ninetyeightcents a pair and hard as boiler plate . The tracks showed a little slip , particularly the right one , as though the man in the shoes had been pushed backward , perhaps by a shove against his rigid body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpertly held . Greenspan had been hit dead center , all right , but the tracks and the slip in them convinced the deputy that the murderer was n't Pete . A workingman , from the size of the tracks , but shooting like a woman or a greenhorn . The next day Manders appeared in Franklin and got his first taste of capital city opposition , even in the county slier/ill 's office . They would n't let him see the hunting boots Pete wore that day . " Got anything comes under the head of new evidence ? " they demanded , not moving off their hunkers for the outside man . Not sure of his rights , Manders started off towards the state sheriff 's office at the capitol . On the way he passed a WPA crew tearing out an old streetcar track . There he saw what he had been searching for , the oldtime split cowhide shoes . So he went back downtown , to the Farmers Outfitting company , the Army and Navy store , and finally , with little hope , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they carried no shoes , not yet . And when they did , it would n't be split cowhides . Some Coopsdid , but here the trade was with white-collar and universitypeople . Franklin had almost no laboring people with enough security to go into a co-operative venture . It was live from day to day as best you may with them , all their lives . In fact , the only split cowhides that Hamm had seen around town for a long time were some distributed to the relief cases a while ago , probably elsewhere too , and booming the corn-plaster business something grand . So the deputy went away , to look in at Mario 's pool hall . All the talk was about Pete 's going haywire like that . " That 's the way with them quiet , easy-going fellers  --  " one of the men at the spittoon said . " Yeh , and him pretending to be a friend of the Jew 's all the time  --  " " You think it got anything to do with him getting that chunk of shrapnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , trying to justify this thing the little man seemed to have done . Franklin , jaded with two good Blue Ridge suicides this fall , lost interest in little Pete by the middle of the week . He was the same as out in the Big Walls right now , and it 'd be the chair for him sure if he did n't have that service medal.  | As it was any shyster lawyer would know enough to make a lot of that brave savior-of-his-country stuff , and it 'd go over too , big enough to keep him out of the chair . With so little to read in the papers , mostly just election and foreign stuff , the townspeople looked through the item about a little domestic trouble among the reliefers . It seemed that a woman called Ada Smith came to the police station with her three children , saying she was afraid to stay at home because her husband was threatening her with a gun , a big old shotgun he 'd borrowed somewhere to go hunting Sunday . And why did he threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she was , she admitted . He could n't work , and with relief what it 'd got to be in Franklin she could do better for herself . Anyway , they 'd lost that , way back when she got her job , which was n't much , even with Jim cooking and looking after the children . She 'd been making eight dollars a week taking cash at a movie house ; been doing that ever since she was picked for that Pygmalion moving picture . The judge remembered the publicity story . Ada Smith was the woman made over , a permanent in her shaggy hair , a whole new outfit , with hat , veil , and purse in exchange for the loose , shapeless dress and flat shoes she had from the Salvation Army . Some good girdling , too , around the hips , as he recalled the pictures now . By this time Ada was laughing heartily . Yes , quite a little girdling  --  and brassiering too , Judge , upping them four , five inches . At her explanatory gesture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he demanded . Well , she was leaving him , she admitted freely now , going into a little place a friend had set up for her . But she could n't take the children along , and there was no need to , with Jim such a good hand and able to get relief as soon as she filed her divorce . It was all fixed except that now he 'd taken top247waving the gun around , and she was afraid to leave the children . Seemed like he 'd gone outright crazy , saying there 'd be others like Greenspan , getting buckshot in the back  --  meaning her new boy friend , she guessed . Because it was a particularly dull Monday , the police reportergave her story some time and got most of it into the paper , with a picture of Ada in her Pygmalion clothes last spring over the caption : Remember Her ? Then there was one of her little girls in old reliefer dresses and Jim , with a gun awkwardly in his hand , standing in front of the old basement house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back helping a friend lift the engine from a jallopy . Once more Deputy Manders came to Franklin , and this time he got the authorities to listen to him , to let him see the boots of Peter Mario , take a look at the reliefer shoes of Jim Smith . When Jim 's fit the plaster casts of the tracks in the horseweeds , he did n't deny anything . Yes , he 'd been hanging around Pete 's for years . It was handy to a lot of reliefers in that row of Franklin Trust shacks they all had to live in or lose county aid . So he knew where Pete and Greenspan always went hunting . He borrowed an old ten-gauge gun and two shells and hooked a ride out that way . The son-of-a-bitch had busted up his home . But he had named another man yesterday , Jim was reminded . Oh , yeh , the one who was taking his wife  --  but that bastardwould n't a looked at her a second if Greenspan had n't spent $12.75 on her for beauty treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Goddamn movingpicture . " Well , there you have it , " the better Franklinites told each other . " You ca n't do anything for such people . Give one of those reliefers a permanent and a manicure and you are shot in the back by her husband . " However , the incident had its good side , too , for it gotp248a murderer behind the Big Walls , and rid the town of a man who showed disturbing pictures like those government ones on housing and such crap . Besides that , all Jews , even those who were n't pushing and greasy , were an embarrassment to a town nowadays , especially a capital city with a university . Saturday there was more good news . The Italian had sold his pool hall , was leaving . One of the women bowlers collectednickels from among the old customers and at the depot they gave him a ring with the insignia of his company , and engraved around the inside : To a Good Soldier . Frightened in his surprise , little Pete looked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them some word of thanks . But nothing came , and so , his eyes pouring , he fled to the train , while many of those left behind wondered who would loan them a dollar now when the relief check was late , or something unforeseen came up . " Cities of lost dogs , " an ex-legislator from over in Nebraska called the state capitals of the middle west . " Out-of-jobbers from governor to capitol janitor just keep hanging around , ca n't seem to get away from their little taste of soup meat . " Then there were the thousands of students turned out by the university the last fifteen years , most of them just waiting around too . " The outstate kids come in in style but mostly they 'll have to hitch-hike home , " the Coot said last spring from his stand on top of a fire hydrant where he watched the cap-and-gown parade gather for the march to the diplomas . " Yeh , mostly they 'll thumb out , those that get away . " Many never would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noseful of clover up against a fence , they would stand there bawling , unwilling to return to their own grass pasture . " Just waiting at the corner of Schendler 's for fifteen minutes depresses me for days , " Abigail once told Hamm . " The uneasiness , the fear in the faces passing  --  naked , the trouble of and an appointment book , with the names of most of the women of the Ridge . And she really was wonderful , Eloise Johnson told Elizabeth Black . " Makes you feel so desirable  --  " Of course , Goldie had no time for Old Connie any more now , or for any of the long list of employables on relief who wanted to know if the WPA quota might be raised to include them this winter . Most of the bridge-playing wives , the divorcees , and the stenographersstill went to the velvet-hung quarters of Charley Stet 's La Belle Rose in the old Fox theater . She had tried to get into the Equity building , with marble corridors and Venetian blinds , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fox was handy to the board of trade and the side entranceshelped the business men avoid their wives and stenographers , or anyone else , if they paid La Belle to arrange it so . Not that this business was new to them . Glen Doover of the Franklin Mills had a long telephone bill each month for tips on wheat from a New York astrologer ; and in his office , beside the picture of a sailfish he once caught , was the horoscopecast by Evangeline Adams . " I made fifty thousand that year on her advice  --  " he would say , a little nostalgically . " And plenty are doing the same right now , only in millions , with the right tips . " For those of shorter pocketbook there were dozens of unlicensednumerologists , palmists , card layers , and trance readersscattered over the town . The spiritualists had a large followingthat split into factions over Dr. Robert Maxell , whose business card labeled him The World 's Greatest Astro-Psychologistand Former Associate of the Great William Dudley Pelley , that some knew was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxell was only a crude and vulgar eater of raw meat , with a fake Indian control . The others believed him . Both groups had Sunday evening services , with prayer , song , and reading services after the silver collection . The readingsp251were either from some article , as a string of beads or a pencil brought up from the audience , or by simply closing the eyes , and beginning , in a deep , flat voice : " Someone comes to me here , comes for the lady in back , on the aisle . You  --  " pointinga finger out ahead . " He brings a message for you . It is of a private nature . I can not speak it here .  --  Do you understand ? " So the lady in back , on the aisle , usually stayed for a special twenty-five-cent reading and perhaps even came for a five-dollar one next day . While the chiropractors kept pretty well to the aspects of their calling , with only a minor tirade against regulatory state legislatures , and a recommendation that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inbalance , the bankers did a good bit of government baiting during convention hours . Outside of that , it was mostly heavy drinking and bragging , bragging about big-game hunting , women , and of farms and buildings foreclosed . One more bad year for the farmer who still imagined that war profits might soak down to him and the last of the good places would begin to break loose , like an ice jam in the spring . Yes , but already there was talk of special taxes for absentee landlords in Kanewa , like in Alabama . It looked like that was the only way to keep the rural schools up , Gilley from the Carstairs National pointed out , with the tenants either not daring to vote enough taxes or losing the places to those who saw the light . His associates laughed goodnaturedly . Should the schools really be kept up ? Was n't a great percentage of the public spoiled by a literacy beyond their understanding , which only served to make them victims of propaganda and too big for their britches ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only two discordant notes : an argument whether Blockert , out of the penitentiary six months now , should be welcomed back among them so soon , and the invocation by a minister up at Stockholm . From the text : " Money is thep252root of all evil , " the old Swede lectured the gathering for twenty uncomfortable minutes on their responsibility as handlers of the world 's greatest degrader of individuals and of government , the cause of almost all crime and misery and of all poverty , the prostitutor of the arts and of the very church itself . " Christ drove the money changers from the temple once ! " he roared over them . " May he appear among us again in this hour of our need  --  Amen . " The date for Mollie 's sailing passed and she was still in Franklin , though none could say she had seen the girl . When the annulment trial did n't come up , Della Loran went to the courthouse and was told the suit had been withdrawn , withdrawnuntil it was decided whether Parson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to marry anybody . So she hurried up to the club , just in time for the tea hour , and ladies ' day , too . There was news . Maybe Mollie Tyndale had gone off for a whole night with a man without even being married to him . " Pride goes before a fall , " many an older woman told her neighbors , reminding them of the white satin duchess dress back in September and that Presentation dinner . And maybe the Gold Shirts were right to take that Burt Parr out and whip him good  --  protecting the good women of the capital city . Every time Hamm went to the hospital he was afraid the boy would ask about Mollie , but as his back healed and the swelling left his jaw , Burt became very quiet , almost never using his scratch pad any more . Usually he just nodded soberly as Hamm came in , his eyes glad for a friend to sit there at his shoulder , and then turned his hospital face away . Hamm was a little worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either starved into their cabs again or the armed strikebreakers taking over the wheels . No , neither one , Lewis told him , although the finks were all over the state , and the men uneasy as horses at butcheringp253time . Negotiations were still on , the strikers asking federal arbitration , with Kanewa the last hold-out against the Twelve State agreement , and with plenty of evidence that most of the operatives were ready to sign at the start . But they had been threatened with the loss of their hauling by organized businessif they did , and now it was a freeze-out , with the strikersrefused relief , and all working members of their families fired . Around Grandapolis the picketing must be keeping the roads pretty clear ; every week or so another delegation of businessmen came roaring up to the governor . When he pointed out that he had no power in county enforcement of the antipicketinglaw , they wanted the sheriff removed and the nationalguards called out . With Walnut County controlled by the strikers , the bridges over the Grand and through them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business all going to the few signed-up outfits in Kanewa and the out-of-state companies . The governor was sitting tight until his resignation was effective , right after election . He was a sick man , he said , and felt no call to mar his last month in office with an illegal action or with civil war . Around town the pitying expression " sick man " became an angry " weak man " but beyond that there was n't much they could do . Unfortunately , the lieutenant governor , a right-thinking Franklinite , was under indictment for acceptinga bribe from the Grandapolis Power company to vote off a tie . " That 's what he gets for straying off the reservation and trying to cut out the middleman 's profit . The capital city boys take care of their own , " was the comment around the chamber . Stone , resident attorney for the company , only laughed . The supreme-court decision on the constitutionality of the anti-picketing law was still expected every Monday . Each time the strikers gathered early at the temple , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly through the stone corridors of the capitol past the supreme court . " We 're no hoodlums and rowdies making trouble . We 're good American citizens , only asking what 's our rights  --  " Lew Lewis tried to tell a reporter , who only shook his head regretfully and walked on . And each Monday noon , when Lew came to Ike 's for a hamburger , Nora welcomed him with grateful eyes . Not this week ; the trouble had n't come this week . Yet each delay only made a clash with the police or the superpatriots seem more likely . Some thought that was why the decision was held up . Others said it was to give Judge Golden time to get sick . He was from the irrigation country up on the Grand , the one liberal justice , and said to be a quarterJew . Ill health would be an easy out for him , with his gaunt , pale face , and that look of pain . Not that he 'd missed a day in fourteen years , but he 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the louder patriots around the City Club told each other over their drinks . With him out the decision was in the bag . Along towards the middle of October the business men 's general viewing of the future with alarm took on more specificaspects . All PWA grants were postponed . " Mebby the howling around here wo n't be quite so loud as over government spending , but this time it shure will come from away down under the pants buttons , " Old Horsemeat told Hamm . Nor was the howling only from the capital city and Kanewa . Several other states had been allotted their full share of money for the year , it seemed . Now suddenly the chambers of commerce were anxious that the government spend as much money as possible . They were solicitous , too , in their long telegrams and telephone calls to Washington , about the probable effects of this curtailmentin public works just before election . In addition , a hurry-up protest meeting was called in the main ballroomp255of the Buffalo Hotel . Abigail went down to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from her own investigations how hard the winter without this work would be . The bald barrel of a man at the door seemed doubtful about letting a woman in , but she got past him to a place in the back ; folding chairs creaking all through the room , and heads craning to see as her name was whispered along . To amuse herself , she sketched the doorman , his head a swollen red , and completely bare . Franklin grew none so full-blooded as this ; he must be one of the Grandapolis politicians , perhaps a favorite . They did have a mayor with hair once , she remembered , but he was n't re-elected . Among the disappointed contractors and labor representatives , Abigail noticed the city dads from all over Kanewa . Of course the Grandapolis delegation got the floor first , windy as March on the farthest stretches of Wild Horse Plains . They showed great concern for the workingman and anger with the government for breaking faith with the needy . Even the president of the Business Men 's Association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bewail the plight of the poor workingman who had put up a heroic struggle against unemployment , with winter just around the corner , and his government going back on him . " I 'll tell you , " the big soapman said , his voice rising to fill all the room , " it 's hard for a man willing and able to work to sit around idle while his wife and children starve ! " The labor leaders were called upon to say a few words , and even the head of the striking truckers received loud applause from the fink-protecting mayors of Grandapolis and Franklin . But the real push of the meeting came from the contractors , mostly lean , sun-browned , serious men who had somehow pulled through the ten years of depression . While they hated the government supervision of PWA money that cut so deeply into their profits , they were in productive work , realists . They joked a little about this sudden concern over the workingman ; admitted that hungry and barefooted women and children were the best argument with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plea should come from someone not aligned and armed against them , " There 's no sense in fighting labor , " Bill Colder , for fifty years a bridge builder in Kanewa , often told the rest . " When you once get your eyes open so you can see your nose before your face you 'll know that a well-paid workingman is your best guarantee of a steady customer . His money is the circulatingkind . " And while the city politicians kept interrupting with campaignoratory , the contractors moved firmly towards a resolutionstressing the seven years of drouth and the long , predepressionhard times of the farmer and the stockgrower of the state , with its subsequent chronic unemployment , and insisted that the first signers be the labor representatives . When this carried , Abigail slipped out the back way for lunch with Hamm Rufe and talk of the meeting . Perhaps Carl Halzer would make it too . He was due in town ; had been outstate since before the Presentation dinner , although Marylin Welles saw that he got an invitation . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to tell him , but really hoped he would notice her new blue suit , a blue he once said he liked on her ; soft , green-cast . But the farmer had other things on his mind than fall clothes , and better things to do than sit through the folderol of the dinner . He was going out into the state to talk for a thinking farm vote , and to look into the growth and backing of the Midwest Farmers ' Association instead of campaigning for himself . Marylin Welles had some urgent visiting to do among her outstate sorority sisters . Her persistence worried Hamm Rufe . At first her fancy for the shock-headed farmerp257with his hard , broken-nailed hands , his eyes dark and unwarmingas a glacial stream , had seemed just another version of her chase from Atlantic City to Arizona to Sun Valley . Later Hamm bean , to wonder if she might not be like her father , grasping at the one honest thing she saw in a decadent , parasiticworld . But with the rise of the new Farmers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold Shirts and old Charley Stet , Hamm was getting pretty uneasy about a Welles 's interest in Carl . The farmer came in around one o'clock , gaunt-eyed and tired under the bush of hair no more subdued than before he ever saw Marylin , although his hands were softening and slimmingdown considerably in their escape from the grain scoop and the husking hook . He had made two talks last night , and afterward started the four-hundred-mile drive to Franklin , with a stop for a short one at Dix this morning , because he was disturbed about the Burt business . Still , he had rather been expecting it , with things going as they were in the capital city . Parasites were natural-born fascist . The hope of Kanewa was in the outstate voter , he thought . But a high-pressure membership crew for the Midwest Farmers was sweeping the state like a hot wind in corn-tasseling time , clear out over Wild Horse Plains . They pretended it was a non-partisan organization whose business was looking out for the farmer at the capital and in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organizers were the same as for the Farmers ' Non-partisan Association in 1936 , when they got themselves investigated by a senate committee and their pictures in the paper . But the speakers sent out were honey-voiced boys who come high and all the writers of Cole Dringer 's patent insides for the country papers appeared in the Midwest Farmer , which was violently anti-administration , anti-labor , and anti-Semitic , too . Every man with a plot of ground big as the seat of his pants found a copy in his mailbox Saturdays , free . The subscrip-258tion list was supposed to be over a million . Even at half that it ran into money . Yes , that was serious , Hamm admitted over his cold pipe . He wished Stephani would come . She would know 1iow widespreadthis was . Mollie Tyndale could do nothing for Burt , not even come to see him , but every day there was a little unsigned note and when he was ready to go home , and wondering where the hospital money was to come from , he was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew then that there was still the old neighborliness between the Tyndales and the Parrs of Sheffield and it made the loss of Mollie no easier . Hamm brought the boy out to his cabin . Burt let himself slowly to the edge of the couch , to sit , saying nothing , while the fire burnt up high . Several of the squatters hurried over to see him , Old Connie shaking her scrub-reddened fist towards the Stone House . " Them feisty loafers  --  ! " she cried . She knew all about them , tramping over her clean floors at all hours at the bank . They 'd be robbing the vaults next . She would n't put it past them . And what she could tell about their goings on ! The Coot came in too , standing awkwardly against the closed door , his grey head sooted and smoky from the winter fire already laid in his cave , for the nights were getting pretty cold and the slopes white-frosted twice the last week . As he filled his pipe from Hamm 's tobacco he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brass , with warts on ' em , " he advised . That way you can fix the bastards  --  " Inside of an hour it was all over the bottoms that Burt was out . After dark , when the place was finally empty of visitors , there was another knock at Hamm 's door . It was Cobby 's little Hattie , in a short , gay-striped house dress , a red kettle in her hand , steam creeping out under the lid . Chicken and Polish dumplings for them both . That would give the youngP259man strength . Well , yes , she would come in a minute , just a minute . On the couch beside Burt sloe accepted a cigarette , and drew the smoke in deep . " It 's pretty bad for you , " she said at last to the boy . " But it would be much worse to have a son like that  --  like Harold ! " Hamm nodded , thinking once more of the Cobby who had been his best friend so long ago . Then he noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wondered if the Gold Shirts might be after Hattie ; or , worse , Harold himself . Hamm looked at the small , blonde girl sitting so quietly besideBurt . Pretty , but with something beyond that , somethingthat was a refuge , as in Stephani . He got up to put more wood on the fire and then returned to the silence of the others . When Hattie left she stopped in the doorway . " He better not come around me again , that Harold , " she said , as though in a warning , " or he will not drag girls like Mollie Tyndale into that house or tie people to trees any more . If he bothers me I think maybe I shall kill him myself . " P260THE blue skies of October were streaking , greying rapidly towards a bleak November . On the windier days the Coot and his cronies left the dumps early and went into town for the noon rush , to lean against the buildings and watch the girls go by . Not that they really cared much about seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending . They could feel like old hellers , poking each other , laughing , making the passing girls prance a little , and switch their butts like pretty young mares out on spring pasture . None of them went around Hamm much the last week . His dump was gloomier than an old clay cave , the Coot complained . Why , he might as well be living over on the other side of town , where they were taking turns swallowingpoison . That 's where he belonged . Hamm lifted his head but the Coot was already humming softly at one of his old songs , probably " Polly-WollyDoodle , " from the beat of his shoe on the floor . Evidently he meant nothing special . But Hamm really was worried . Nothinghad been done about a manager for the Co-op , and last week two strange women came in to hang around the lending shelf of books and pamphlets on co-operatives . They looked like snoopers , and when they refused Hamm 's advice about reading matter , he went away to restock the candy case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slip a couple of books and several pamphlets into their long oilcloth bags.  |p261When  they were gone Hamm called the police and was told that books were hard to locate . " They 's a mighty lot of them , mister . " So he reported the loss to the board , Sweden , the Middle Way , the Fowler , and five pamphlets . They looked concerned , Ona Snell particularly , and told Hamm they would consider the wisest action . Saturday the Christian Challenger came out with a special Co-op issue , giving excerptsfrom both Child and Fowler to illustrate their dangerousun-American beliefs , with an open boast of the raid on the station 's books , as though the shelves were steel-barred and guarded with machine guns . Several paragraphs from Hamm 's articles during the past year in the Nation convinced him that there was more than local talent behind this . He was right ; the attack on the Co-ops for distributing subversive literature was a general one throughout the middle best , and most heated in Kansas and Minnesota , perhaps a gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a strong one , Hamm argued , but the board gave him even more evasive answers and he went away wondering if the long pressure was n't softening them up , particularly those on the universitystaff who hoped for advancement ; wondered whether the only new thing to sprout and grow in the capital city in the last forty years might not already have its taproot cut . The night after Burt left the hospital Carl Halzer stopped in from a talk at a suburban schoolhouse . He was depressed , heavy as the worn fall earth of a tenant farm . He sat unmovingbeside the radio through the end of the Toscanini program , not even knowing that the music was done . The other two seemed to have little better than sitting to do either , their heads bowed , their wrists hanging . Ten o'clock ; Stephani not arrived , and young Burt still up . At last Hamm called Abigail . Was she busy ; were all the writing boys and gals gone , and was it too late to have them over a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone was gone but Smith Bridges , the son of the old Populist Tod Bridges and really not too violent a tory , Abigail told them , laughing , although he did waste his time collecting such things as Dwight Fiske records , and recited , at almost no provocation , one about a Mrs. Pettibone . He also could reproduce an unorthodoxversion of the Adam and Eve story . Oh , they were not to be scared out by any admirer of Mrs. Pettibone 's , not this night , Hamm warned . Of course not , and they were to hurry , please , for she could smell the doughnuts Smith was frying in her kitchen . So they went over , stretched Burt flat and easy on the couch , and brought out the coffee and Abigail 's big green mixing bowl piled high with golden doughnuts . Already they were feeling a little more human . Nor was Smith Bridges so bad . He was a small , thinnish man , with a humorous cut down the center of his full lower lip , and a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blinky . He did n't offer to recite anything , but did tell them a little about himself . He got out of town once , as far as England on a Rhodes scholarship , and picked up infantile paralysis . While he pulled out of that pretty well , with very little crippling , it brought him back here for the long cure . " Not that I was n't grateful to have a place to come  --  you understand  --  " he said . But he had a newspaper job lined up with the Times in Paris and just being ad man for a Franklin paper somehow was n't enough , even though it was the World with the tradition of George Rufer behind it . " Much , much too far behind it , " he said , with rueful lip . Hamm looked at the little man with new interest . Carl , too , evidently ; for when Bridges asked how things seemed out in the state , he frankly admitted that he did n't like the situation . The region around Franklin he always considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as bad outstate . People told of the fine orchards and shade trees of the earlyP263settlers where only weeds stood dusty and grey now . Even the occupied houses seemed to squat lower into the earth every year , as though they had to brace themselves to hold up the lean-to kitchens and the sagging back porches , usually crowded with a stinking old separator , maybe a tub of dirty wash , a kerosene can , a sack of boiling potatoes , and even a bitch and her pups . And usually the poddy pot , sitting out plain all day next to the baskets of corncobs fresh from the hog lot . Off in the capital city the owner , or more often the local representative of the eastern owner , laid cherry-wood sticks from the old orchard on his open fire , or just turned on an electric log , the world 's cleanest heat , as the page ads of the utilities claimed , while the renter 's wife fed her fire with stinking pigpen corncobs . Something of the old Populist father stirred in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucer in one hand , the coffee cup in the other , waving them both . Yes , that was all true , and it would get worse . It made a man sick to know that all this might have been prevented if his dad and the Pops had won . And they would have , too , he believed , if there had n't been the Spanish American War , which was a shot in the arm , for finance , if not the little fellow , with more shots every so often since . But the last twenty years at least one patient , the capital city , has n't been reacting so well , with more and more empty fronts along Philadelphia Avenue like sagging pockets under the eyes . When Wall Street started paying high interest on security loans along in the twenties , business concernsway out here in Franklin became investment and bankinginstitutions , with fellows like Glen Doover , J. B. Groves , even Cees Hammond actually squeezing every loose penny out of their business for speculation . Hamm looked up at that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , at least enough to let Cees do it  --  " When the end came they would n't believe it . They kept trying to prove that where you lose ' em 's where you find ' em . And , well , " Smith said , finally gulping the coffee to hide his embarrassment and setting the cup in its saucer  --  " they still think they can do it , here . " " How does it happen that you see these things ? " Abigail asked curiously . " It is n't perception that the parasite loses first , you know ; it 's the courage to face the reality he sees , and the will and power to act  --  " the son of old Tod Bridges told them . " Sounds just like the Coot over on Grandview Hill , only a little more elegantly phrased , " Hamm said . Well , the Coot was often right , if a little dirty . Franklin business men thought they could make more loaning their money in the call market or trading in securities themselves than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some money  --  " Abigail pointed out . " Well , they drained their companies of everything except the red ink and made what they thought was big money on paper . Then when it all blew up they went into tantrums like the foolish wife who finds that the lover she left her husband for has decamped . " Abigail laughed . " Yes , when I was investigating for the book I found that the money in the capital city was made from the rise of Kanewa 's real estate , mostly from free land , the country 's hundred fifty year long WPA project for the unemployed . You were sent west to camp on a chunk of the public domain for a certain time , and it was yours , without even bothering with a shovel to lean on . Just so you kept your embarrassing carcass off the doorstep of the east , and , incidentally , helped open new regions for exploitation by capital . " " Yes , and when the system broke down in the nineties , you could buy up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle had died , " Smith Bridges admitted . " That 's how the Franklin National got going  --  and the rest of the town . P265Even those who did n't get their money off the land direct got it from the settlers , or , " nodding towards Abigail , " from the sell-outs over at the old Frontier Hotel  --  " " Yes , and that all came out of the soil , not only the fields , but the pastures , too , all the earth of the state , " Carl added . Even the beauty of the country was drained out , the bittersweetvanished from the creek lines , the harebells were dug up , and who remembered that columbines were once wild and as common as dogtooth violets in the oak woods of the Wakoon and the Grand ? All that was left of the oak woods were the stubborn old stumps in the weedy pastures , and the redbud that once bloomed in rosy smoke along the breaks were only a few scrawny bushes beside the garages in Franklin and in Grandapolis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all skinned down like a bald man 's head , and holding no more water  --  " Abigail looked up at the wild bush on the farmer 's head . " You 're still saving about all that falls  --  " she laughed . But Carl was not to be turned from his theme . He 'd seen a lot of the government 's work out in the state . Under all the dog-howling in the papers about the shelter belt and the poison-ivy gardens , the men had been going quietly ahead with their job and were bringing the farmer back to the treeplantingof his grandfathers . Even the highway engineers were setting out little clumps of juniper and evergreens to relieve long , monotonous stretches  --  with such native stuff as buffaloberry and wild plum and redbud set against the scars of the deeper cuts . In time this generation , too , would learn by what labor you got these things , and value them accordingly . It was fine talk to hear , and Hamm looked in admiration upon the farmer from down the Little Grand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he threw his jumper down before the rifle-armed deputies in the street and
