Practically any course chosen by the late captain of the U. S. S. Akron , other than the one he did choose , might have taken the ship out of danger . <P> The Akron 's aerologist ( who went down with his ship ) had predicted thunderstorms " but had no doubt of the ship 's ability to avoid bad weather . " <P> The one surviving officer believes the ship was broken by striking the water . The two surviving enlisted men believe she was broken by wind a few moments before she hit the sea . <P> Before casting off for her last flight , the Akron was scheduled for extensive repairs , involving one of the girders which the enlisted men saw snap as she crashed . Nevertheless " she was as sound as when she first arrived in Lakehurst . " <P> A vertical current rammed the ship down . . . . Suddenly speeded engines pulled her tail lower . ... A green helmsman at the elevator controls let her nose rise too high , causing a stall . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Broken gas cells . . . . <P> Such was the welter of testimony- plausible , contradictory , inconclusive-before the Naval Court of Inquiry when it adjourned last week from Lakehurst Naval Air Station to Washington Navy Yard . The court was moved to the Capital because witnesses were required to appear also before the joint Congressional investigating committee which convenes this week . <P> Man with Beard . Shortly before the court left Lakehurst , in walked a startling little man , forehead bald as a bullet , and sat himself in the witness chair . Piercing blue eyes blazed above a pickled Mephistophelian profile-long , hooked nose and pointed reddish beard . He was Captain Anton Heinen who began testing and flying Zeppelins in Germany in 1910 . He flew the Bodensee between Berlin and Friedrichshafen with clocklike regularity and claims to have carried 100,000 passengers without a single casualty in ten years piloting . The U. S. Navy hired him in 1922 to help supervise construction of the Shenandoah and train its first crew . Lieut. - Commander Herbert V. Wiley , Akron survivor , was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 70-mi , gale with 21 men aboard , it was Capt . Heinen who brought her back , damaged but whole . His contract expired in 1924 and he left Navy employ following bitter controversies with high officers over airship practice . Three years ago he formed a company to build and sell " air yachts " ( four-passenger blimps ) for $10,000 each . The scheme failed . Currently he lives at Lakewood , N. J. , frequently breaks into print as an oracle on airship matters . Last week he had a chance to augment his meagre finances by reporting the Lakehurst inquiry for Hearst 's International News Service . Yet he said he would donate the proceeds to a fund for the families of Akron victims . <P> Capt . Heinen was seated in one of the wide-armed Press chairs , painstakingly writing notes of testimony , when the judge advocate called him to the witness stand . Taking the jumbled jigsaw bits of eyewitness testimony , he fitted them against his own background of experience : <P> He agreed with Commander Wiley that a sudden down-current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that that broke the ship .
