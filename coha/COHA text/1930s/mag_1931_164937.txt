To his Rapidan camp President Hoover last week took his tall , angular friend Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur , Secretary of the Interior , and eight Wilbur assistants . Their purpose : to devise Interior economies to help reduce the prospective billion-dollar budget . When the executives came down the mountainside ( their cars in low gear because of mud ) , a plan had been worked out whereby $4,000,000 would be snipped out of Interior expenditures this year , $6,000,000 next year , $8,000,000 the year after . Added to the War Department pruning planned the previous week-end ( see p. 19 ) , the Interior cut will take $8,000,000 off the 1932 budget . Next Departments for presidential pruning : Agriculture , Post Office , Treasury . Last week President Hoover engaged a new literary secretary to replace French Strother , resigned . He was George Aubrey Hastings , 46 , of New York , oldtime newshawk and press agent . His title will be Executive Clerk instead of Administrative Assistant and he will do the research and " ghostwriting " the President requires for public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences and commissions on child health . Press photographs showed him to the country wearing a little dark mustache and goatee . But he shaved these off his round , pleasant face some time ago . President Hoover again turned to the personnel of the Wartime Food Administration when he selected Harvey H. Bundy , Boston attorney , as an Assistant Secretary of State . For two years Mr. Bundy was assistant counsel under Food Administrator Hoover . Also appointed last week by President Hoover , to be Surgeon General of the Army , was Col. Robert U. Patterson . The State Department keeps a list of special anniversaries in all foreign countries of which the President of the U. S. should take notice . On each anniversary the Department sends out a message of congratulation and signs the President 's name . Last week such messages went to King Carol II of Rumania , President Guggiari of Paraguay , President Moscicki of Poland ( two Independence Days , one Constitution Day ) . <P> Edwin Thompson , Lord Mayor of Liverpool , lately called on President Hoover . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotes the President .
