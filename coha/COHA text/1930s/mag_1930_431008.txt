I HAD called on a United States Senator to interview him on some proposed divorce legislation . " Divorce ! Divorce ! " he exclaimed finally . " I am tired of this talk of divorces . One hears nothing else ! " " There are so many of them , " I apologized . " Are there ? " he demanded , and at the words he whirled irritably in his big swivel chair , his blue eyes half-angry , his gray hair disheveled . " Tell me just how many are there ? " " One in seven marriages ? according to the last census report , " I informed him . " I am told the forthcoming report will show a larger ? " " One in seven ! " he interrupted . " Well , what of it ? In every group of seven young girls there 's usually a shallow one . Take any seven young men ; you 're likely to find a weakling in the lot . Is that anything , to be alarmed about ? It 's the other twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about them . " 30 " No , " I admitted , " we never do . " He crossed over to the window and threw it open . The roar of the twilight city came faintly in , borne on a spring breeze . The wind stirred some hyacinths in a bowl by the window . Their color drew my eyes . And then I noted , standing near them , the daguerreotype of a lovely young girl , an adorable , shorthaired flapper of eighty years ago , dressed in a blue frock . Her blue eyes were dancing . Her resolute little face was a-twinkle with mischief . In that rather dull , bookish room the daguerreotype burned like a blue jewel . The Senator turned to find me looking at it . He took it up quickly , tenderly . " It is my mother , " he said . " This was her wedding present to my father . " He brought the little daguerreotype over to the desk with him and sat down . " There was no divorce in that home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked ? " It was a successful marriage ? " He smiled . Suddenly he began to tell me the story ? while the twilight deepened in the room , and lights pricked out in the tall buildings round about . It was a story of poverty and young love ; of long years of waiting ; of more years of illness ; of obstacles finally overcome ; of a deeply happy married life . " They died , " he said , " within a day of each other . She went first . My father the following day , of grief . " He added soberly : " I can not say that our home was without a word of dispute or altercation . She was high-spirited . My father was strong-willed . But I can say this ? their little quarrels were rare , and never more than skin-deep . And I can still remember how lovely it was to see them make up . Had any one suggested that they rush off to the divorce courts after a spat , they would have laughed . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that environment . When I came to marrying , my own choice was as fortunate as my father 's . My wife  | and I are inseparable today . Our marriage has been deeply satisfying . " He looked down at the daguerreotype , then up at me . " You came in here to talk about divorce , to urge some additional divorce legislation . Instead , let me tell you there are far more happy marriages today than divorces . Many times more ! The two marriages I know most about were very happy . I want you to promise me this : For a little while quit hunting divorce statistics ! Hunt happy marriages instead ? and tell us what you find . Tell us why those marriages were successful , where others today are failing . It 's worth a try . And it 's needed . Young love , marriage , home , the voices of little children ? these are the finest things in life . And they 're here , all around us . Only we Americans have grown a blind spot somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nation of divorces . " He rose . " Will you try my plan ? " " I will see what I can find to confirm you , " 1 ' promised . And it seemed to me that the blue girl smiled up at me from the desk . I found my first happy-marriage story by accident . I had dropped into the New York Supreme Court to hear a case tried by a distinguished judge , the honorable John Ford . Judge Ford has been on the Supreme Court bench for almost twentyfive years . He had not been scheduled to try a divorce case that morning , but apparently the calendar had been rearranged , for a particularly pitiable divorce case was before him . A young husband and wife were exchanging low-voiced recriminations . The man teas exclaiming bitterly : " Your Honor , 1 do n't believe there 's a decent woman living . I do n't believe there 's a real wife anywhere today . Not one man I know has a real home . Wives ? Today they 're just rotters ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on his desk . Magnificent in his anger , he leaned forward , an imposing , silver-haired man in court robes . And for twenty minutes , quietly , sternly , he talked to the young cynic before him about our American homes , our American women about all that the word " home " means to right-minded American people today . It was thrilling ? from a judge who had been trying divorce cases for almost a quarter of a century . When court adjourned for a recess , I sought the Judge in his chambers . " Your marriage mast have been very happy , Judge Ford ? " I ventured . He bowed .  | " Yes . I do n't know where I would have been today , if I had not had my home life all these years ? the privilege of my wife 's companionship . We have been happy together . I have found home joys the only satisfying happiness on earth . " " How long have you been married ? " " Thirty-nine years ! And my wife and I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true affection deepens with the years . " " Was there any time , during that period , when either of you would have retraced the step ? " He shook his head slowly . " No . We 've had our ups and downs , and occasional little quarrels . They passed away , leaving no mark . Our home life has been happy and full . I have two daughters and a little grand-daughter . I love my children , and they love me . But the bond between man and woman is the closest tie on earth . There is n't anything else like it . Every man should have it ? have some one who cares for him regardless of the rest of the world . " I asked what , in the background of both , or in their upbringing , might possibly account for the success of their marital experiment . Judge Ford hesitated . " Simplicity in our upbringing , perhaps , " he replied . He sketched for me swiftly the little sixteenacre farm in Orleans County , New York , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his fourteenth year he went out to do work at eleven dollars per month . I " That was my background , " commented Judge Ford . " Wholesome , but a struggle for a living . I had to work my way through college . It was at Cornell that I first met my wife , Miss Lulu Fairchild Van Aken . Ithaca was her home . We became engaged at the end of my Junior year and were married in 1891 , the year after I graduated . " " Tell me this , Judge Ford , " the writer urged , " Why has your marriage been so successful , whereas so many today are failures ? " " First , we were really mated . As for making the marriage a success , my wife did that . It is the woman who makes or unmakes marriage ? granted she has married a man , not a bounder . " " But surely there is some certain thing you have done , or left undone , as a husband , which has helped to make yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
