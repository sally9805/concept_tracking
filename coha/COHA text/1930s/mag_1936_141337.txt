At the first modern revival of the Olympic Games in 1896 , a little crew of casually assembled athletes foundered through a helter-skelter track meet at Athens . In the four decades since , the modern Olympic Games have become what their founder , Baron Pierre de Coubertin , hoped that they might one day be and what the ancient Olympic Games actually were : World 's No. i sports event . <P> Last week in Berlin , daily crowds of 110,000 packed the gigantic new Olympic Stadium . Below them cavorted the finest athletes in the world . In the press stand sat 1,500 reporters , hundreds more than customarily report League of Nations doings at Geneva . Whether or not the Olympic Games actually serve their purpose of promoting international understanding remains dubious . That they afford harmless amusement to participants &; spectators , a valuable chance for ballyhoo to the nation which holds them , no one is better aware than Realmleader Adolf Hitler , who attended every session except one last week , inspired his loyal Nazi followers to win the unheard of total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no country wins the Olympic Games . Patterned on their Greek models , each event is an individual contest of which the winner is an individual or a specialized team . Any effort to rate Olympic performances in national units raises questions of procedure such as whether the sport of Running , backbone of the Olympics , with 14 major subdivisions , should be given the same importance as the sport of Canoeing . <P> Actually , the U. S. always wins the Olympic Games because its entrants are not only ablest , but most numerous . To arrive at some sort of basis for comparison , sports writers long ago invented a system for tabulating all events on the basis of ten points for first place , five for second , four for third and so on down to one for sixth . Graded by this system , the first six countries in men 's track &; field events , after eight days of competition , were last week as follows : U. S. 203 points Finland 80 points Germany 69 points Japan 51 13/22 points Great Britain 43 1/11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track &; field events were finished . No. 1 hero of the world 's No. 1 sports event was a Cleveland Negro named Jesse Owens . No. 1 heroine , with the possible exception of Mrs. Eleanor Holm Jarrett , because she was not allowed to compete , was a Fulton , Mo. , filly named Helen Stephens . The Olympic Games had produced eight deaths , innumerable misunderstandings , enough revenue to repay all running expenses and part of what it would otherwise have cost Germany for barracks for 4,000 soldiers , the best sports arena in the world . Events : <P> Hero Owens . In 1924 Finn Paavo Nurmi won three Olympic races . Last week at Berlin , Cleveland 's coffee-colored Jesse Owens bettered this achievement . On the first day of competition he broke the world 's record for 100 metres in a trial heat ( 10.2 sec . ) . On the second day , he won the final in world-record time ( 10.3 ) . On the third , he won the broad jump with a new Olympic record ( 26 ft. , 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the 200-metre dash with a new world 's record ( 20.7 sec. ) for a track with a turn . Finally , selected for the U. S. 400-metre relay team , he helped it equal the world 's record in a trial heat , break it winning the final in 39.8 sec.
