SCENE : The scene is the bank of a river under a bridgehead . A gigantic span starts from the rear of the stage and appears to lift over the heads of the audience and out to the left . At the right rear is a wall of solid supporting masonry . To the left an apartment building abuts against the bridge and forms the left wall of the stage with a dark a basement window and a door in the brick wall . To the right , and in the foreground , an outcropping of orginial rock makes a barricade behind which one may enter through a cleft . To the rear , against the masonry , two sheds have been built by waifs and strays for shelter . The river bank , in the gorground , is black rock worn smooth by years of trampling . There is room for exist and entrance to the left around the apartment house , also around the rock to the right . A single street lamp is seen at the left  --  and a glimmer of apartment lightys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December morning . Two Young Men in Serge lean against the masonry , matching bills .

Sleep , sleep it off , whatever you had last night , get down in warm , one big ham-fat against another  --  sleep , cling , sleep and rot ! Rot out your pasty guts with diddling you had no brain to begin . If you had there 'd be no need for us to sleep on iron who had too much brains for you . p. 3 SHADOW Now look , Trock , look , what would the warden say to talk like that ?

Anything you say goes , but give me leave to kid a little . TROCK Then laugh at somebody else ! It 's a lot safer ! They 've soaked me once too often in that vat of poisoned hell they keep up-state to soak men in , and I 'm rotten inside , I 'm all one liquid puke inside where I had lungs once , like yourself !

He starts out CURTAIN p. 6 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONESCENE II SCENE : A cellar apartment under the apartment building , floored with cement and roofed with huge boa constrictor pipes that run slantwise from left to right , dwarfing the room . An outside door opens to the left and a door at the right rear leads to the interior of the place . A low squat window to the left . A table at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furniture . GARTH , son of Esdras , sits alone , holding a violin upside down to inspect a crack at its base . He lays the bow on the floor and runs his fingers over the joint . MIRIAMNE enters from the rear , a girl of fifteen . GARTH looks up , then down again . MIRIAMNE Garth  --  GARTH The glue lets go . It 's the steam , I guess . It splits the hair on your head . MIRIAMNE It ca n't be mended ? GARTH I ca n't mend it . No doubt there are fellows somewhere who 'd mend it for a dollar  --  and glad to do it . That is if I had a dollar .  --  Got a dollar ? No , I thought not . MIRIAMNE Garth , you 've sat at home here three days now . You have n't gone out at all . Something frightens you . GARTH Yes ? MIRIAMNE And father 's frightened . He reads without knowing where . When a shadow falls across the page he waits for a blow to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts his book down softly and goes out to see who passed . p. 7 GARTH A bill collector , maybe . We have n't paid the rent . MIRIAMNE No . GARTH You 're a bright girl , sis .  --  You see too much . You run along and cook . Why do n't you go to school ? MIRIAMNE I do n't like school . They whisper behind my back . GARTH Yes ? About what ? MIRIAMNE What did the lawyer mean that wrote to you ? GARTH RisingWhat lawyer ? MIRIAMNE I found a letter on the floor of your room . He said , " Do n't get me wrong , but stay in out of the rain the next few days , just for instance . " GARTH I thought I burned that letter . MIRIAMNE Afterward you did . And then what was printed about the Estrella gang  --  you hid it from me , you and father . What is it  --  about this murder  --  ? GARTH Will you shut up , you fool ! MIRIAMNE But if you know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true  --  what they say  --  you knew all the time Romagna was n't guilty , and could have said so  --  GARTH Everybody knew Romagna was n't guilty ! But they were n't listening to evidence in his favor . They did n't want it . They do n't want it now . p. 8 MIRIAMNE But was that why they never called on you  --  GARTH So far as I know they never 'd heard of me  --  and I can assure you I knew nothing about it  --  MIRIAMNE But something 's wrong  --  and it worries father  --  GARTH What could be wrong ? MIRIAMNE I do n't know . A pause GARTH And I do n't know . You 're a good kid , Miriamne , but you see too many movies . I was n't mixed up in any murder , and I do n't mean to be . If I had dollar to get my fiddle fixed and another to hire a hall , by God I 'd fiddle some of the prodigies back into Sunday School where they belong , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bite my nails  --  but if you hoped I had some criminal romantic past you 'll have to look again ! MIRIAMNE Oh , Garth , forgive me  --  But I want you to be so far above such things nothing could frighten you . When you seem to shrink and be afraid , and you 're the brother I love , I want to run there and cry , if there 's any question they care to ask , you 'll be quick and glad to answer , for there 's nothing to conceal ! GARTH And that 's all true  --  p. 9 MIRIAMNE But then I remember  --  how you dim the lights  --  and we go early to bed  --  and speak in whispers  --  and I could think there 's a death somewhere behind us  --  an evil death  --  GARTH Hearing a stepNow for God 's sake , be quiet !

The outer door is suddenly thrown open . TROCK appears TROCK After a pause You 'll excuse me for not knocking . SHADOW follows Trock inSometimes it 's best to come in quiet . Sometimes it 's a good way to go out . Garth 's home , I see . He might not have been here if I made a point of knocking at doors . GARTH How are you , Trock ? TROCK I guess you can see how I am . To MiriamneStay here . Stay where you are . We 'd like to make your acquaintance .  --  If you want the facts I 'm no better than usual , thanks . Not enough sun , my physician tells me . Too much close confinement . A lack of exercise and an overplus of beans in the diet . You 've done well , no doubt ? p. 10 GARTH I do n't know what makes you think so . TROCK Who 's the family ? GARTH My father and my sister . TROCK Happy to meet you . Step inside a minute . The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no  --  he 's said nothing  --  nothing , sir , nothing ! TROCK When I say go out , you go  --  ESDRAS Pointing to the doorMiriamne  --  GARTH Go on out , both of you ! ESDRAS Oh , sir  --  I 'm old  --  old and unhappy  --  GARTH Go on ! MIRIAMNE and ESDRAS go inside TROCK And if you listen I 'll riddle that door ! SHADOW shuts the door behind them and stands against itI just got out , you see , and I pay my first call on you . GARTH Maybe you think I 'm not in the same jam you are . TROCK That 's what I do think . Who started looking this up ? GARTH I wish I knew , and I wish he was in hell ! Some damned professor with nothing else to do . If you saw his stuff you know as much as I do . p. 11 TROCK It was n't you turning state 's evidence ? GARTH Hell , Trock , use your brain ! The case was closed . They burned Romagna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for trouble and maybe get burned myself ? TROCK Boy , I do n't know , but I just thought I 'd find out . GARTH I 'm going straight , Trock . I can play this thing , and I 'm trying to make a living . I have n't talked and nobody 's talked to me . Christ  --  it 's the last thing I 'd want ! TROCK Your old man knows . GARTH That 's where I got the money that last time when you needed it . He had a little saved up , but I had to tell him to get it . He 's as safe as Shadow there . TROCK Looking at ShadowThere could be people safer than that son-of-a-bitch . SHADOW Who ? TROCK You 'd be safer dead along with some other gorillas . SHADOW It 's beginning to look as if you 'd feel safer with everybody dead , the whole god-damn world . TROCK I would . These Jesus-bitten professors ! Looking up their half-ass cases ! We 've got enough without that . p. 12 GARTH There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose they called on you and asked you to testify ? GARTH Why then I 'd tell ' em that all I know is what I read in the papers . And I 'd stick to that . TROCK How much does your sister know ? GARTH I 'm honest with you , Trock . She read my name in the professor 's pamphlet , and she was scared the way anybody would be . She got nothing from me , and anyway she 'd go to the chair herself before she 'd send me there . TROCK Like hell . GARTH Besides , who wants to go to trial again except the radicals ?  --  You and I wo n't spill and unless we did there 's nothing to take to court as far as I know . Let the radicals go on howling about getting a dirty deal . They always howl and nobody gives a damn . This professor 's red  --  everybody knows it . TROCK You 're forgetting the judge . Where 's the damn judge ? GARTH What judge ? TROCK Read the morning papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's got that damn trial on his mind , and been going round proving to everybody he was right all the time and the radicals were guilty  --  stopping people in the street to prove it  --  and now he 's nuts entirely and nobody knows where he is. p. 13 GARTH Why do n't they know ? TROCK Because he 's on the loose somewhere ! They 've got the police of three cities looking for him . GARTH Judge Gaunt ? TROCK Yes . Judge Gaunt . SHADOW Why should that worry you ? He 's crazy , ai n't he ? And even if he was n't he 's arguing on your side . You 're jittery , chief . God , all the judges are looney . You 've got the jitters , and you 'll damn well give yourself away some time peeing yourself in public . TROCK half turns toward Shadow in angerDo n't jump the gun now , I 've got pockets in my clothes , too . His hand is in his coat pocket TROCK All right . Take it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHADOW does the same To GarthMaybe you 're lying to me and maybe you 're not . Stay at home a few days . GARTH Sure thing . Why not ? TROCK And when I say stay home I mean stay home . If I have to go looking for you you 'll stay a long time wherever I find you . To ShadowCome on . We 'll get out of here . To GarthBe seeing you . SHADOW and TROCK go out . After a pause GARTH walks over to his chair and picks up the violin . Then he puts it down and goes to the inside door , which he opens p. 14 GARTH He 's gone . MIRIAMNE enters , ESDRAS behind her MIRIAMNE Going up to GarthLet 's not stay here . She puts her hands on his arms I thought he 'd come for something  --  horrible . Is he coming back ? GARTH I do n't know . MIRIAMNE Who is he , Garth ? GARTH He 'd kill me if I told you who he is , that is , if he knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll say it ! I was with a gang one time that robbed a pay roll . I saw a murder done , and Trock Estrella did it . If that got out I 'd go to the chair and so would he  --  that 's why he was here today  --  MIRIAMNE But that 's not true  --  ESDRAS He says it to frighten you , child . GARTH Oh , no I do n't ! I say it because I 've held it in too long ! I 'm damned if I sit here forever , and look at the door , waiting for Trock with his sub-machine gun , waiting for police with a warrant !  --  I say I 'm damned , and I am , no matter what I do ! These piddling scales on a violin  --  first position , third , fifth , arpeggios in E  --  and what I 'm thinking is Romagna dead for the murder  --  dead while I sat here dying inside  --  dead for the thing Trock did while I looked on  --  and I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him die instead of me because I wanted to live ! Well , it 's no life , and it does n't matter who I tell , because I mean to get it over ! p. 15 MIRIAMNE Garth , it 's not true ! GARTH I 'd take some scum down with me if I died  --  that 'd be one good deed  --  ESDRAS Son , son , you 're mad  --  someone will hear  --  GARTH Then let them hear ! I 've lived with ghosts too long , and lied too long . God damn you if you keep me from the truth !  --  He turns awayOh , God damn the world ! I do n't want to die ! He throws himself down ESDRAS I should have known . I thought you hard and sullen , Garth , my son . And you were a child , and hurt with a wound that might be healed .  --  All men have crimes , and most of them are hidden , and many are heavy as yours must be to you . GARTH sobsThey walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimson stain tinges the inner vestments , touches flesh , and burns the quick . You 're not alone . GARTH I 'm alone in this . ESDRAS Yes , if you hold with the world that only those who die suddenly should be revenged . But those whose hearts are cancered , drop by drop in small ways , little by little , till they 've borne all they can bear , and die  --  these deaths will go unpunished now as always . When we 're young we have faith in what is seen , but when we 're old we know that what is seen is traced in air and built on water . There 's no guilt under heaven , just as there 's no heaven , till men believe it  --  no earth , till men have seen it , and have a word to say this is the earth . p. 16 GARTH Well , I say there 's an earth , and I say I 'm guilty on it , guilty as hell . ESDRAS Yet till it 's known you bear no guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by like film , like a long written scroll , a figured veil unrolling out of darkness into fire and utterly consumed . And on this veil , running in sounds and symbols of men 's minds reflected back , life flickers and is shadow going toward flame . Only what men can see exists in that shadow . Why must you rise and cry out : That was I , there in the ravelled tapestry , there , in that pistol flash , when the man was killed . I was there , and was one , and am bloodstained ! Let the wind and fire take that hour to ashes out of time and out of mind ! This thing that men call justice , this blind snake that strikes men down in the dark , mindless with fury , keep your hand back from it , pass by in silence  --  left it be forgotten , forgotten !  --  Oh , my son , my son  --  have pity ! MIRIAMNE But if it was true and someone died  --  then it was more than shadow  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true . ESDRAS Say it if you must . If you have heart to die , say it , and let them take what 's left  --  there was little to keep , even before  --  GARTH Oh , I 'm a coward  --  I always was . I 'll be quiet and live . I 'll live even if I have to crawl . I know . He gets up and goes into the inner room p. 17 MIRIAMNE Is it better to tell a lie and live ? ESDRAS Yes , child . It 's better . MIRIAMNE But if I had to do it  --  I think I 'd die . ESDRAS Yes , child . Because you 're young . MIRIAMNE Is that the only reason ? ESDRAS The only reason . CURTAIN p. 18 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT ONESCENE III SCENE : Under the bridge , evening of the same day . When the curtain rises MIRIAMNE is sitting alone on the ledge at the rear of the apartment house . A spray of light falls on her from a street lamp above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sits still as if heedless of the weather . Through the rocks on the other side a TRAMP comes down to the river bank , hunting a place to sleep . He goes softly to the apple-woman 's hut and looks in , then turns away , evidently not daring to prempt it . He looks at Miriamne doubtfully . The door of the street-piano man is shut . The vagabond passes it and picks carefully among some rags and shavings to the right . MIRIAMNE looks up and sees him but makes no sign . She looks down again , and the man curls himself up in a makeshift bed in the corner , pulling a piece of sacking over his shoulders . TWO GIRLS come in from round the apartment house . 1ST GIRL Honest , I never heard of anything so romantic . Because you never liked him . 2ND GIRL I certainly never did . 1ST GIRL You 've got to tell me how it happened . You 've got to . 2ND GIRL I could n't . As long as I live I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 19 1ST GIRL What was so terrible ? 2ND GIRL The way it happened . 1ST GIRL Oh , please  --  not to a soul , never . 2ND GIRL Well , you know how I hated him because he had such a big mouth . So he reached over and grabbed me , and I began all falling to pieces inside , the way you do  --  and I said , " Oh no you do n't mister , " and started screaming and kicked a hole through the windshield and lost a shoe , and he let go and was cursing and growling because he borrowed the car and did n't have money to pay for the windshield , and he started to cry , and I got so sorry for him I let him , and now he wants to marry me. 1ST GIRL Honest , I never heard of anything so romantic ! She sees the sleeping TrampMy God , what you wo n't see ! They give the Tramp a wide berth , and go out right . The TRAMP sits up looking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well dressed but in clothes that have seen some weather , comes in uncertainly from the left . He holds a small clipping in his hand and goes up to the Hobo JUDGE GAUNT TentativelyYour pardon , sir . Your pardon , but perhaps you can tell me the name of this street . p. 20 HOBO Huh ? JUDGE GAUNT The name of this street ? HOBO This ai n't no street . JUDGE GAUNT There , where the street lamps are . HOBO That 's the alley . JUDGE GAUNT Thank you . It has a name , no doubt ? HOBO That 's the alley . JUDGE GAUNT I see . I wo n't trouble you . You wonder why I ask , I daresay .  --  I 'm a stranger .  --  Why do you look at me ? He steps back I  --  I 'm not the man you think . You 've mistaken me , sir . HOBO Huh ? JUDGE GAUNT Perhaps misled by a resemblance . But you 're mistaken  --  I had an errand in this city . It 's only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . JUDGE GAUNT Going nearer to him , bending over himYet why should I deceive you ? Before God , I held the proofs in my hands . I hold them still . I tell you the defense was cunning beyond belief , and unscrupulous in its use of propaganda  --  they gagged at nothing  --  not even  --  He risesNo , no  --  I 'm sorry  --  this will hardly interest you . I 'm sorry . I have an errand . He looks toward the street . ESDRAS enters from the basement and goes to Miriamne . The JUDGE steps back into the shadows p. 21 ESDRAS Come in , my daughter . You 'll be cold here . MIRIAMNE After a while . ESDRAS You 'll be cold . There 's a storm coming . MIRIAMNE I did n't want him to see me crying . That was all . ESDRAS I know . MIRIAMNE I 'll come soon . ESDRAS turns reluctantly and goes out the way he came . MIRIAMNE rises to go in , pausing to dry her eyes . MIO and CARR , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment house . The Judge has disappeared CARR Thought you said you were never coming east again . MIO Yeah , but  --  I heard something changed my mind . CARR Same old business ? MIO Yes . Just as soon not talk about it . CARR Where did you go from Portland ? MIO Fishing  --  I went fishing . God 's truth . CARR Right after I left ? MIO Fell in with a fisherman 's family on the coast and went after the beautiful mackerel fish that swim in the beautiful sea . Family of Greeks  --  Aristides Marinos was his lovely name . He sang while he fished . Made the pea-green Pacific ring with his bastard Greek chanties . Then I went to Hollywood High School for a while . p. 22 CARR I 'll bet that 's a seat of learning . MIO It 's the hind end of all wisdom . They kicked me out after a time . CARR For cause ? MIO Because I had no permanent address , you see . That means nobody 's paying school taxes for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid ? MIRIAMNE Nothing . She looks up at him , and they pause for a momentNothing . MIO I 'm sorry . MIRIAMNE It 's all right . She withdraws her eyes from his and goes out past him . He turns and looks after her CARR Control your chivalry . MIO A pretty kid . CARR A baby . MIO Wait for me . CARR Be a long wait ? Mio steps swiftly out after Miriamne , then returnsYeah ? MIO She 's gone . CARR Think of that . MIO No , but I mean  --  vanished . Presto  --  into nothing  --  prodigioso. p. 23 CARR Damn good thing , if you ask me . The homely ones are bad enough , but the lookers are fatal . MIO You exaggerate , Carr . CARR I doubt it . MIO Well , let her go . This river bank 's loaded with typhus rats , too . Might as well die one death as another . CARR They say chronic alcoholism is nice but expensive . You can always starve to death . MIO Not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked thirty miles to Niagara Falls and made a tour of the plant to get the sample of shredded wheat biscuit on the way out . CARR Last time I saw you you could n't think of anything you wanted to do except curse God and pass out . Still feeling low ? MIO Not much different . He turns away , then comes backTalk about the lost generation , I 'm the only one fits that title . When the State executes your father , and your mother dies of grief , and you know damn well he was innocent , and the authorities of your home town politely inform you they 'd consider it a favor if you lived somewhere else  --  that cuts you off from the world  --  with a meat-axe . CARR They asked you to move ? p. 24 MIO It came to that . CARR God , that was white of them . MIO It probably gave them a headache just to see me after all that agitation . They knew as well as I did my father never staged a holdup . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CARR Yes  --  I saw her . MIO I do n't mean the skirt .  --  No , I got wind of something , out west , some college professor investigating the trial and turning up new evidence . Could n't find anything he 'd written out there , so I beat it east and arrived on this blessed island just in time to find the bums holing up in the public library for the winter . I know now what the unemployed have been doing since the depression started . They 've been catching up on their reading in the main reference room . Man , what a stench ! Maybe I stank , too , but a hobo has the stench of ten because his shoes are poor . CARR Tennyson . MIO Right . Jeez , I 'm glad we met up again ! Never knew anybody else that could track me through the driven snow of Victorian literature . CARR Now you 're cribbing from some half-forgotten criticism of Ben Jonson 's Roman plagiarisms . MIO Where did you get your education , sap ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father kept a news-stand . MIO Well , you 're right again . There is a faint rumble of thunderWhat 's that ? Winter thunder ? CARR Or Mister God , beating on His little tocsin . Maybe announcing the advent of a new social order . MIO Or maybe it 's going to rain coffee and doughnuts . CARR Or maybe it 's going to rain . MIO Seems more likely . Lowering his voiceAnyhow , I found Professor Hobhouse 's discussion of the Romagna case . I think he has something . It occurred to me I might follow it up by doing a little sleuthing on my own account . CARR Yes ? MIO I have done a little . And it leads me to somewhere in that tenement house that backs up against the bridge . That 's how I happen to be here . CARR They 'll never let you get anywhere with it , Mio . I told you that before . MIO I know you did . CARR The State ca n't afford to admit it was wrong , you see . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up over it . So for all practical purposes the State was right and your father robbed the pay roll . p. 26 MIO There 's still such a thing as evidence . CARR It 's something you can buy . In fact , at the moment I do n't think of anything you ca n't buy , including life , honor , virtue , glory , public office , conjugal affection and all kinds of justice , from the traffic court to the immortal nine . Go out and make yourself a pot of money and you can buy all the justice you want . Convictions obtained , convictions averted . Lowest rates in years . MIO I know all that . CARR Sure . MIO This thing did n't happen to you . They 've left you your name and whatever place you can take . For my heritage they 've left me one thing only , and that 's to be my father 's voice crying up out of the earth and quicklime where they stuck him . Electrocution does n't kill , you know .

Out of the house and into the ground , you wife of a dead dog . Wait , here 's some Romagna spawn left . Something crawls here  --  something they called a son . Why could n't he die along with his mother ? Well , ease him out of town , ease him out , boys , and see you 're not too gentle . He might come back . And , by their own living Jesus , I will go back , and hang the carrion around their necks that made it ! Maybe I can sleep then . Or even live . p. 27 CARR You have to try it ? MIO Yes . Yes .

LUCIA Maybe we ca n't play in front , maybe we can play behind ! The HOBO gets up from his nest and comes over to watch . A YOUNG RADICAL wanders inMaybe you do n't know , folks ! Tonight we play goodbye to the piano ! Good-bye forever ! No more piano on the streets ! No more music ! No more money for the music-man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye forever ! MIRIAMNE comes out the rear door of the apartment and stands watching . The SAILOR goes over to the 1st Girl and they dance togetherMaybe you do n't know , folks ! Tomorrow will be sad as hell , tonight we dance ! Tomorrow no more Verdi , no more rumba , no more good time ! Tonight we play goodbye to the piano , good-bye forever ! The RADICAL edges up to Miriamne , and asks her to dance . She shakes her head and he goes to Piny , who dances with him . The HOBO begins to do a few lonely curvets on the side aboveHoy ! Hoy ! Pick ' em up and take ' em around ! Use the head , use the feet ! Last time forever ! He begins to sing to the air p. 30 MIO Wait for me , will you ? CARR Now 's your chance . MIO goes over to Miriamne and holds out a hand , smiling . She stands for a moment uncertain , then dances with him . ESDRAS comes out to watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rumble of thunder LUCIA Hoy ! Hoy ! Maybe it rains tonight , maybe it snows tomorrow ! Tonight we dance good-bye . He sings the air lustily . A POLICEMAN comes in from the left and looks on . TWO OR THREE PEDESTRIANS follow him POLICEMAN Hey you ! LUCIA goes on singingHey , you ! LUCIA Still playingWhat you want ? POLICEMAN Sign off ! LUCIA What you mean ? I get off the street ! POLICEMAN Sign off ! LUCIA Still playingWhat you mean ? The POLICEMAN walks over to him . LUCIA stops playing and the DANCERS pause POLICEMAN Cut it . LUCIA Is this a street ? p. 31 POLICEMAN I say cut it out . The HOBO goes back to his nest and sits in it , watching LUCIA It 's the last time . We dance good-bye to the piano . POLICEMAN You 'll dance good-bye to something else if I catch you cranking that thing again . LUCIA All right . PINY I 'll bet you do n't say that to the National Biscuit Company ! POLICEMAN Lady , you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I said nothing about it  --  PINY Selling apples is allowed  --  POLICEMAN You watch yourself  --  He takes a short walk around the place and comes upon the HoboWhat are you doing here ? The HOBO opens his mouth , points to it , and shakes his head Oh , you are , are you ? He comes back to LuciaSo you trundle your so-called musical instrument to wherever you keep it , and do n't let me hear it again . The RADICAL leaps on the base of the rock at right . The 1ST GIRL turns away from the Sailor toward the 2nd Girl and Herman p. 32 SAILOR Hey , captain , what 's the matter with the music ? POLICEMAN Not a thing , admiral . SAILOR Well , we had a little party going here  --  POLICEMAN I 'll say you did . 2ND GIRL Please , officer , we want to dance . POLICEMAN Go ahead . Dance . 2ND GIRL But we want music ! POLICEMAN Turning to goSorry . Ca n't help you . RADICAL And there you see it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music should be free as air and the arts should be encouraged , a uniformed minion of the rich , a guardian myrmidon of the Park Avenue pleasure hunters , steps in and puts a limit on the innocent enjoyments of the poor ! We do n't go to theatres ! Why not ? We ca n't afford it ! We do n't go to night clubs , where women dance naked and the music drips from saxophones and leaks out of Rudy Vallee  --  we ca n't afford that either !  --  But we might at least dance on the river bank to the strains of a barrel organ  --  ! GARTH comes out of the apartment and listens POLICEMAN It 's against the law ! p. 33 RADICAL What law ? I challenge you to tell me what law of God or man  --  what ordinance  --  is violated by this spontaneous diversion ? None ! I say none ! An official whim of the masters who should be our servants !  --  POLICEMAN Get down ! Get down and shut up ! RADICAL By what law , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLICEMAN Speaking without a flag . You know it . RADICAL Pulling out a small American flagThere 's my flag ! There 's the flag of this United States which used to guarantee the rights of man  --  the rights of man now violated by every third statute of the commonweal  --  POLICEMAN Do n't try to pull tricks on me ! I 've seen you before ! You 're not making any speech , and you 're climbing down  --  JUDGE GAUNT Who has come quietly forwardOne moment , officer . There is some difference of opinion even on the bench as to the elasticity of police power when applied in minor emergencies to preserve civil order . But the weight of authority would certainly favor the defendant in any equable court , and he would be upheld in his demand to be heard . POLICEMAN Who are you ? p. 34 JUDGE GAUNT Sir , I am not accustomed to answer that question . POLICEMAN I do n't know you . JUDGE GAUNT I am a judge of some standing , not in your city but in another with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bill of rights is not to be set aside lightly by the officers of any municipality  --  POLICEMAN Looking over Gaunt 's somewhat bedraggled costumeMaybe they understand you better in the town you come from , but I do n't get your drift .  --  To the RadicalI do n't want any trouble , but if you ask for it you 'll get plenty . Get down ! RADICAL I 'm not asking for trouble , but I 'm staying right here . The POLICEMAN moves toward him JUDGE GAUNT Taking the policeman 's arm , but shaken off roughlyI ask this for yourself , truly , not for the dignity of the law nor the maintenance of precedent . Be gentle with them when their threats are childish  --  be tolerant while you can  --  for your least harsh word will return on you in the night  --  return in a storm of cries !  --  He takes the Policeman 's arm againWhatever they may have said or done , let them disperse in peace ! It is better that they go softly , lest when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands touch you , fingering cold on your heart !  --  I have been harsher than you . I have sent men down that long corridor into blinding light and blind darkness ! He suddenly draws himself erect and speaks defiantlyAnd it was well that I did so ! I have been an upright judge ! They are all liars ! Liars ! p. 35 POLICEMAN Shaking GAUNT off so that he fallsWhy , you fool , you 're crazy ! JUDGE GAUNT Yes , and there are liars on the force ! They came to me with their shifty lies ! He catches at the POLICEMAN , who pushes him away with his foot POLICEMAN You think I 've got nothing better to do than listen to a crazy fool ? 1ST GIRL Shame , shame ! POLICEMAN What have I got to be ashamed of ? And what 's going on here , anyway ? Where in hell did you all come from ? RADICAL Tread on him ! That 's right ! Tread down the poor and the innocent ! There is a protesting murmur in the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to step on the guy . POLICEMAN Facing them , stepping backWhat 's the matter with you ? I have n't stepped on anybody ! MIO At the right , across from the PolicemanListen now , fellows , give the badge a chance . He 's doing his job , what he gets paid to do , the same as any of you . They 're all picked men , these metropolitan police , hand picked for loyalty and a fine up-standing pair of shoulders on their legs  --  it 's not so easy to represent the law . Think what he does for all of us , stamping out crime ! Do you want to be robbed and murdered in your beds ? p. 36 SAILOR What 's eating you ? RADICAL He must be a capitalist . MIO They pluck them fresh from Ireland , and a paucity of headpiece is a prime prerequisite . You from Ireland , buddy ? POLICEMAN SurlyWhere are you from ? MIO Buddy , I tell you flat I wish I was from Ireland , and could boast some Tammany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force . It infects the brain , it eats the cerebrum . There 've been cases known , fine specimens of manhood , too , where autopsies , conducted in approved scientific fashion , revealed conditions quite incredible in policemen 's upper layers . In some , a trace , in others , when they 've swung a stick too long , there was nothing there !  --  but nothing ! Oh , my friends , this fine athletic figure of a man that stands so grim before us , what will they find when they saw his skull for the last inspection ? I fear me a little puffball dust will blow away rejoining earth , our mother  --  and this same dust , this smoke , this ash on the wind , will represent all he had left to think with ! HOBO Hooray ! The POLICEMAN turns on his heel and looks hard at the HOBO , who slinks away p. 37 POLICEMAN Oh , yeah ? MIO My theme gives ears to the deaf and voice to the dumb ! But now forgive me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a simple man of simple tastes , and easily confused when faced with complex issues . He may reflect on returning home , that is , so far as he is capable of reflection , and conclude that he was kidded out of his uniform pants , and in his fury when this dawns on him may smack his wife down ! POLICEMAN That 'll be about enough from you , too , professor ! MIO May I say that I think you have managed this whole situation rather badly , from the beginning ?  --  POLICEMAN You may not ! TROCK slips in from the background . The Two YOUNG MEN IN SERGE come with him MIO Oh , but your pardon , sir ! It 's apparent to the least competent among us that you should have gone about your task more subtly  --  the glove of velvet , the hand of iron , and all that sort of thing  --  POLICEMAN Shut that hole in your face ! MIO Sir , for that remark I shall be satisfied with nothing less than an unconditional apology ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , because they 're fools and fat-heads , and you 're one of the most fatuous fatheads that ever walked his feet flat collecting graft ! Tell that to your sergeant back in the booby-hatch. p. 38 POLICEMAN Oh , you want an apology , do you ? You 'll get an apology out of the other side of your mouth ! He steps toward Mio . CARR suddenly stands in his pathGet out of my way ! He pauses and looks round him ; the crowd looks less and less friendly . He lays a hand on his gun and backs to a position where there is nobody behind himGet out of here , all of you ! Get out ! What are you trying to do  --  start a riot ? MIO There now , that 's better ! That 's in the best police tradition . Incite a riot yourself and then accuse the crowd . POLICEMAN It wo n't he pleasant if I decide to let somebody have it ! Get out ! The onlookers begin to melt away . The SAILOR goes out left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , CARR whistling " The Star Spangled Banner . " The HOBO follows them . The RADICAL walks past with his head in the air . PINY and LUCIA leave the piano where it stands and slip away to the left . At the end the POLICEMAN is left standing in the center , the JUDGE near him . ESDRAS stands in the doorway . MIRIAMNE is left sitting half in shadow and unseen by ESDRAS JUDGE GAUNT To the PolicemanYes , but should a man die , should it be necessary that one man die for the good of many , make not yourself the instrument of death , lest you sleep to wake sobbing ! Nay , it avails nothing that you are the law  --  this delicate ganglion that is the brain , it will not bear these things  --  ! The POLICEMAN gives the Judge the once-over , shrugs , decides to leave him there and starts out left . GARTH goes to his father  --  a fine sleet begins to fall through the street lights . TROCK is still visible p. 39 GARTH Get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GARTH The Judge , damn him ! ESDRAS Is it Judge Gaunt ? GARTH Who did you think it was ? He 's crazy as a bedbug and telling the world . Get him inside ! He looks round ESDRAS Going up to GauntWill you come in , sir ? JUDGE GAUNT You will understand , sir . We old men know how softly we must proceed with these things . ESDRAS Yes , surely , sir . JUDGE GAUNT It was always my practice  --  always . They will tell you that of me where I am known . Yet even I am not free of regret  --  even I. Would you believe it ? ESDRAS I believe we are none of us free of regret . JUDGE GAUNT None of us ? I would it were true . I would I thought it were true . ESDRAS Shall we go in , sir ? This is sleet that 's falling . JUDGE GAUNT Yes . Let us go in . ESDRAS , GAUNT and GARTH enter the basement and shut the door . TROCK goes out with his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alone . He stands at a little distance from Miriamne p. 40 MIO Looks like rain . She is silent You live around here ? She nods gravelyI guess you thought I meant it  --  about waiting here to meet me . She nods again I 'd forgotten about it till I got that winter across the face . You 'd better go inside . I 'm not your kind . I 'm nobody 's kind but my own . I 'm waiting for this to blow over . She rises I lied . I meant it  --  I meant it when I said it  --  but there 's too much black whirling inside me  --  for any girl to know . So go on in . You 're somebody 's angel child and they 're waiting for you . MIRIAMNE Yes . I 'll go . She turns MIO And tell them when you get inside where it 's warm , and you love each other , and mother comes to kiss her darling , tell them to hang on to it while they can , believe while they can it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carries them in his bosom .  --  I 've seen some lambs that Jesus missed . If they ever want the truth tell them that nothing 's guaranteed in this climate except it gets cold in winter , nor on this earth except you die sometime . He turns away MIRIAMNE I have no mother . And my people are Jews . p. 41 MIO Then you know something about it . MIRIAMNE Yes . MIO Do you have enough to eat ? MIRIAMNE Not always . MIO What do you believe in ? MIRIAMNE Nothing . MIO Why ? MIRIAMNE How can one ? MIO It 's easy if you 're a fool . You see the words in books . Honor , it says there , chivalry , freedom , heroism , enduring love  --  and these are words on paper . It 's something to have them there . You 'll get them nowhere else . MIRIAMNE What hurts you ? MIO Just that . You 'll get them nowhere else . MIRIAMNE Why should you want them ? MIO I 'm alone , that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting across the rain  --  ? those are the hearths of Brooklyn , and up this way the love-nests of Manhattan  --  they turn their points like knives against me  --  outcast of the world , snake in the streets .  --  I do n't want a hand-out . I sleep and eat . MIRIAMNE Do you want me to go with you ? p. 42 MIO Where ? MIRIAMNE Where you go . A pause . He goes nearer to her MIO Why , you god-damned little fool  --  what made you say that ? MIRIAMNE I do n't know . MIO If you have a home stay in it . I ask for nothing . I 've schooled myself to ask for nothing , and take what I can get , and get along . If I fell for you , that 's my look-out , and I 'll starve it down . MIRIAMNE Wherever you go , I 'd go . MIO What do you know about loving ? How could you know ? Have you ever had a man ? MIRIAMNE After a slight pauseNo . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's yours ? MIRIAMNE Miriamne . MIO There 's no such name . MIRIAMNE But there 's no such name as Mio ! M.I.O. It 's no name . MIO It 's for Bartolomeo . MIRIAMNE My mother 's name was Miriam , so they called me Miriamne . MIO Meaning little Miriam ? p. 43 MIRIAMNE Yes . MIO So now little Miriamne will go in and take up quietly where she dropped them all her small housewifely cares .  --  When I first saw you , not a half-hour ago , I heard myself saying , this is the face that launches ships for me  --  and if I owned a dream  --  yes , half a dream  --  we 'd share it . But I have no dream . This earth came tumbling down from chaos , fire and rock , and bred up worms , blind worms that sting each other here in the dark . These blind worms of the earth took out my father  --  and killed him , and set a sign on me  --  the heir of the serpent  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods were men  --  but they killed him  --  as they 'll kill all others like him till the sun cools down to the stabler molecules , yes , till men spin their tent-worm webs to the stars and what they think is done , even in the thinking , and they are the gods , and immortal , and constellations turn for them all like mill wheels  --  still as they are they will be , worms and blind . Enduring love , oh gods and worms , what mockery !  --  and yet I have blood enough in my veins . It goes like music , singing , because you 're here . My body turns as if you were the sun , and warm . This men called love in happier times , before the Freudians taught us to blame it on the glands . Only go in before you breathe too much of my atmosphere and catch death from me. p. 44 MIRIAMNE I will take my hands and weave them to a little house , and there you shall keep a dream  --  MIO God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MIRIAMNE You 're laughing at me , Mio ! MIO The worms are laughing . I tell you there 's death about me and you 're a child ! And I 'm alone and half mad with hate and longing . I shall let you love me and love you in return , and then , why then God knows what happens ! MIRIAMNE Something most unpleasant ? MIO Love in a box car  --  love among the children . I 've seen too much of it . Are we to live in this same house you make with your two hands mystically , out of air ? MIRIAMNE No roof , no mortgage ! Well , I shall marry a baker out in Flatbush , it gives hot bread in the morning ! Oh , Mio , Mio , in all the unwanted places and waste lands that roll up into the darkness out of sun and into sun out of dark , there should be one empty for you and me . MIO No . MIRIAMNE Then go now and leave me . I 'm only a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing said . MIO Miriamne . She takes a step toward him p. 45 MIRIAMNE Yes . He kisses her lips lightly MIO Why , girl , the transfiguration on the mount was nothing to your face . It lights from within  --  a white chalice holding fire , a flower in flame , this is your face . MIRIAMNE And you shall drink the flame and never lessen it . And round your head the aureole shall burn that burns there now , forever . This I can give you . And so forever the Freudians are wrong . MIO They 're well-forgotten at any rate . MIRIAMNE Why did you speak to me when you first saw me ? MIO I knew then . MIRIAMNE And I came back because I must see you again . And we danced together and my heart hurt me . Never , never , never , though they should bind me down and tear out my eyes , would I ever hurt you now . Take me with you , Mio , let them look for us , whoever there is to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the tenement MIO When I was four years old we climbed through an iron gate , my mother and I , to see my father in prison . He stood in the death-cell and put his hand through the bars and said , My Mio , I have only this to leave you , that I love you , and will love you after I die . Love me then , Mio , when this hard thing comes on you , that you must live a man despised for your father . That night the guards , walking in flood-lights brighter than high noon , led him between them with his trousers slit and a shaven head for the cathodes . This sleet and rain that I feel cold here on my face and hands will find him under thirteen years of clay in prison ground . Lie still and rest , my father , for I have not forgotten . When I forget may I lie blind as you . No other love , time passing , nor the spaced light-years of suns shall blur your voice , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till I have these rats in my grip or sleep deep where you sleep . To MiriamneI have no house , nor home , nor love of life , nor fear of death , nor care for what I eat , or who I sleep with , or what color of calcimine the Government will wash itself this year or next to lure the sheep and feed the wolves . Love somewhere else , and get your children in some other image more acceptable t the State ! This face of mine is stamped for sewage ! She steps back , surmising p. 46 MIRIAMNE Mio  --  MIO My road is cut in rock , and leads to one end . If I hurt you , I 'm sorry . One gets over hurts . MIRIAMNE What was his name  --  your father 's name ? MIO Bartolomeo Romagna . I 'm not ashamed of it . MIRIAMNE Why are you here ? MIO For the reason I 've never had a home . Because I 'm a cry out of a shallow grave , and all roads are mine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  why here ? MIO I ca n't tell you that . MIRIAMNE No  --  but  --  there 's someone lives here  --  lives not far  --  and you mean to see him  --  you mean to ask him  --  She pauses MIO Who told you that ? MIRIAMNE His name is Garth  --  Garth Esdras  --  MIO After a pause , coming nearerWho are you , then ? You seem to know a good deal about me.  --  Were you sent to say this ? MIRIAMNE You said there was death about you ! Yes , but nearer than you think ! Let it be as it is  --  let it all be as it is , never see this place nor think of it  --  forget the streets you came when you 're away and safe ! Go before you 're seen or spoken to ! p. 47 MIO Will you tell me why ? MIRIAMNE As I love you I ca n't tell you  --  and I can never see you  --  MIO I walk where I please  --  MIRIAMNE Do you think it 's easy for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go MIO Where will I find you then if I should want to see you ? MIRIAMNE Never  --  I tell you I 'd bring you death ! Even now . Listen ! SHADOW and TROCK enter between the bridge and the tenement house . MIRIAMNE pulls MIO back into the shadow of the rock to avoid being seen TROCK Why , fine . SHADOW You watch it now  --  just for the record , Trock  --  you 're going to thank me for staying away from it and keeping you out . I 've seen men get that way , thinking they had to plug a couple of guys and then a few more to cover it up , and then maybe a dozen more . You ca n't own all and territory adjacent , and you ca n't slough all the witnesses , because every man you put away has friends  --  TROCK I said all right . I said fine . SHADOW They 're going to find this judge , and if they find him dead it 's just too bad , and I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . p. 48 TROCK You all through ? SHADOW Why sure . TROCK All right . We 're through , too , you know . SHADOW Yeah ? He becomes wary TROCK Yeah , we 're through . SHADOW I 've heard that said before , and afterwards somebody died . TROCK is silentIs that what you mean ? TROCK You can go . I do n't want to see you . SHADOW Sure , I 'll go . Maybe you wo n't mind if I just find out what you 've got on you . Before I turn my back I 'd like to know . Silently and expertly he touches Trock 's pockets , extracting a gunNot that I 'd distrust you , but you know how it is . He pockets the gunSo long , Trock . TROCK So long . SHADOW I wo n't talk . You can be sure of that . TROCK I know you wo n't . SHADOW turns and goes out right , past the rock and along the bank . As he goes the TWO YOUNG MEN IN BLUE SERGE enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look toward Trock as they enter and he motions with his thumb in the direction taken by Shadow . They follow Shadow out without haste . TROCK watches them disappear , then slips out the way he came . MIO comes a step forward , looking after the two men . Two or three shots are heard , then silence . MIO starts to run after Shadow p. 49 MIRIAMNE Mio ! MIO What do you know about this ? MIRIAMNE The other way , Mio  --  quick ! CARR slips in from the right , in haste CARR Look , somebody 's just been shot . He fell in the river . The guys that did the shooting ran up the bank . MIO Come on . MIO and CARR run out right . MIRIAMNE watches uncertainly , then slowly turns and walks to the rear door of the tenement . She stands there a moment , looking after Mio , then goes in , closing the door . CARR and MIO return CARR There 's a rip tide past the point . You 'd never find him . MIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry insurance living around here .  --  God , it 's easy , putting a fellow away . I never saw it done before . MIO Looking at the place where Miriamne stoodThey have it all worked out . CARR What are you doing now ? MIO I have a little business to transact in this neighborhood . CARR You 'd better forget it . p. 50 MIO No . CARR Need any help ? MIO Well , if I did I 'd ask you first . But I do n't see how it would do any good . So you keep out of it and take care of yourself . CARR So long , then . MIO So long , Carr . CARR Looking down-streamHe was drifting face up . Must be halfway to the island the way the tide runs . He shiversGod , it 's cold here . Well  --  He goes out to the left . MIO sits on the edge of the rock . LUCIA comes stealthily back from between the bridge and the tenement , goes to the street-piano and wheels it away . PINY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but say nothing . LUCIA goes into his shelter and PINY into hers . MIO rises , looks up at the tenement , and goes out to the left@@ SCENE : The basement as in Scene 2 of Act One . The same evening . ESDRAS sits at the table reading , MIRIAMNE is seated at the left , listening and intent . The door of the inner room is half open and Garth 's violin is heard . He is playing the theme from the third movement of Beethoven 's Archduke Trio . ESDRAS looks up . ESDRAS I remember when I came to the end of all the Talmud said , and the commentaries , then I was fifty years old  --  and it was time to ask what I had learned . I asked this question and gave myself the answer . In all the Talmud there was nothing to find but the names of things , set down that we might call them by those names and walk without fear among things known . Since then I have had twenty years to read on and on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evanid nights and days and words that shift their meaning . Space is time , that which was is now  --  the men of tomorrow live , and this is their yesterday . All things that were and are and will be , have their being then and now and to come . If this means little when you are young , remember it . It will return to mean more when you are old . MIRIAMNE I 'm sorry  --  I was listening for something . ESDRAS It does n't matter . It 's a useless wisdom . It 's all I have , but useless . It may be there is no time , but we grow old . Do you know his name ? p. 52 MIRIAMNE Whose name ? ESDRAS Why , when we 're young and listen for a step the step should have a name  --  MIRIAMNE , not hearing , rises and goes to the window . GARTH enters from within , carrying his violin and carefully closing the door GARTH As ESDRAS looks at himAsleep . ESDRAS He may sleep on through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them know . GARTH We 'd be wiser to say nothing  --  let him find his own way back . ESDRAS How did he come here ? GARTH He 's not too crazy for that . If he wakes again we 'll keep him quiet and shift him off tomorrow . Somebody 'd pick him up . ESDRAS How have I come to this sunken end of a street , at a life 's end  --  ? GARTH It was cheaper here  --  not to be transcendental  --  So  --  we say nothing  --  ? ESDRAS Nothing . MIRIAMNE Garth , there 's no place in this whole city  --  not one  --  where you would n't be safer than here  --  tonight  --  or tomorrow . p. 53 GARTH BitterlyWell , that may be . What of it ? MIRIAMNE If you slipped away and took a place somewhere where Trock could n't find you  --  GARTH Yes  --  using what for money ? and why do you think I 've sat here so far  --  because I love my home so much ? No , but if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my last step . MIRIAMNE And yet  --  if you 're here  --  they 'll find you here  --  Trock will come again  --  and there 's worse to follow  --  GARTH Do you want to get me killed ? MIRIAMNE No . GARTH There 's no way out of it . We 'll wait and take what they send us . ESDRAS Hush ! You 'll wake him . GARTH I 've done it . I hear him stirring now . They wait quietly . JUDGE GAUNT opens the door and enters JUDGE GAUNT In the doorwayI beg your pardon  --  no , no , be seated  --  keep your place  --  I 've made your evening difficult enough , I fear ; and I must thank you doubly for your kindness , for I 've been ill  --  I know it . p. 54 ESDRAS You 're better , sir ? JUDGE GAUNT Quite recovered , thank you . Able , I hope , to manage nicely now . You 'll be rewarded for your hospitality  --  though at this moment He smilesI 'm low in funds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and more than monetary , for I must own my recollection 's vague of how I came here  --  how we came together  --  and what we may have said . My name is Gaunt , Judge Gaunt , a name long known in the criminal courts , and not unhonored there . ESDRAS My name is Esdras  --  and this is Garth , my son . And Miriamne , the daughter of my old age . JUDGE GAUNT I 'm glad to meet you . Esdras . Garth Esdras . He passes a hand over his eyesIt 's not a usual name . Of late it 's been connected with a case  --  a case I knew . But this is hardly the man . Though it 's not a usual name . They are silentSir , how I came here , as I have said , I do n't well know . Such things are sometimes not quite accident . ESDRAS We found you outside our door and brought you in . JUDGE GAUNT The brain can be overworked , and weary , even when the man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word I do n't know why I came here , nor how , nor when , nor what would explain it . Shall we say the machine begins to wear ? I felt no twinge of it .  --  You will imagine how much more than galling I feel it , to ask my way home  --  and where I am  --  but I do ask you that . p. 55 ESDRAS This is New York City  --  or part of it . JUDGE GAUNT Not the best part , I presume ? He smiles grimlyNo , not the best . ESDRAS Not typical , no . JUDGE GAUNT And you  --  To Garthyou are Garth Esdras ? GARTH That 's my name . JUDGE GAUNT Well , sir , To EsdrasI shall lie under the deepest obligation if you will set an old man on his path , for I lack the homing instinct , if the truth were known . North , east and south mean nothing to me here in this room . ESDRAS I can put you in your way . GARTH Only you 'd be wiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  JUDGE GAUNT It happens I 'm the judge  --  With stiff humorin more ways than one . You 'll forgive me if I say I find this place and my predicament somewhat distasteful . He looks round him GARTH I do n't doubt you do ; but you 're better off here . JUDGE GAUNT Nor will you find it wise to cross my word as lightly as you seem inclined to do . You 've seen me ill and shaken  --  and you presume on that . p. 56 GARTH Have it your way . JUDGE GAUNT Doubtless what information is required we 'll find nearby . ESDRAS Yes , sir  --  the terminal ,  --  if you could walk so far . JUDGE GAUNT I 've done some walking  --  to look at my shoes . He looks down , then puts out a hand to steady himselfThat  --  that was why I came  --  never mind  --  it was there  --  and it 's gone . To GarthProfessor Hobhouse  --  that 's the name  --  he wrote some trash about you and printed it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a pure fabrication  --  lacking facts and legal import . Senseless and impudent , written with bias  --  with malicious intent to undermine the public confidence in justice and the courts . I knew it then  --  all he brings out about this testimony you might have given . It 's true I could have called you , but the case was clear  --  Romagna was known guilty , and there was nothing to add . If I 've endured some hours of torture over their attacks upon my probity  --  and in this torture have wandered from my place , wandered perhaps in mind and body  --  and found my way to face you  --  why , yes , it is so  --  I know it  --  I beg of you say nothing . It 's not easy to give up a fair name after a full half century of service to a state . It may well rock the surest reason . Therefore I ask of you say nothing of this visit . p. 57 GARTH I 'll say nothing . ESDRAS Nor any of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . You 'd have nothing to gain . ESDRAS Indeed we know it . JUDGE GAUNT I 'll remember you kindly . When I 've returned , there may be some mystery made of where I was  --  we 'll leave it a mystery ? GARTH Anything you say . JUDGE GAUNT Why , now I go with much more peace of mind  --  if I can call you friends . ESDRAS We shall be grateful for silence on your part , Your Honor . JUDGE GAUNT Sir  --  if there were any just end to be served by speaking out , I 'd speak ! There is none . No  --  bear that in mind ! ESDRAS We will , Your Honor . JUDGE GAUNT Then  --  I 'm in some haste . If you can be my guide , we 'll set out now . ESDRAS Yes , surely . There is a knock at the door . The four look at each other with some apprehension . MIRIAMNE rises I 'll answer it . MIRIAMNE Yes . She goes into the inner room and closes the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is repeated . He opens the door . MIO is there p. 58 ESDRAS Yes , sir . MIO May I come in ? ESDRAS Will you state your business , sir ? It 's late  --  and I 'm not at liberty  --  MIO Why , I might say that I was trying to earn my tuition fees by peddling magazines . I could say that , or collecting old newspapers  --  paying cash  --  highest rates  --  no questions asked  --  He looks round sharply GARTH We 've nothing to sell . What do you want ? MIO Your pardon , gentlemen . My business is not of an ordinary kind , and I felt the need of this slight introduction while I might get my bearings . Your name is Esdras , or they told me so outside . GARTH What do you want ? MIO Is that the name ? GARTH Yes . MIO I 'll be quick and brief . I 'm the son of a man who died many years ago for a pay roll robbery in New England . You should be Garth Esdras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the crime , if one can believe what he reads in the public prints , and it might be that your testimony , if given , would clear my father of any share in the murder . You may not care whether he was guilty or not . You may not know . But I do care  --  and care deeply , and I 've come to ask you face to face . p. 59 GARTH To ask me what ? MIO What do you know of it ? ESDRAS This man Romagna , did he have a son ? MIO Yes , sir , this man Romagna , as you choose to call him , had a son , and I am that son , and proud . ESDRAS Forgive me . MIO Had you known him , and heard him speak , you 'd know why I 'm proud , and why he was no malefactor . ESDRAS I quite believe you . If my son can help he will . But at this moment , as I told you  --  could you , I wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ESDRAS By coincidence we too of late have had this thing in mind  --  there have been comments printed , and much discussion which we could hardly avoid . MIO Could you tell me then in a word ?  --  What you know  --  is it for him or against him ?  --  that 's all I need . ESDRAS My son knows nothing . GARTH No . The picture-papers lash themselves to a fury over any rumor  --  make them up when they 're short of bedroom slops.  --  This is what happened . I had known a few members of a gang one time up there  --  and after the murder they picked me up because I looked like someone that was seen in what they called the murder car . They held me a little while , but they could n't identify me for the most excellent reason I was n't there when the thing occurred . A dozen years later now a professor comes across this , and sees red and asks why I was n't called on as a witness and yips so loud they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I know about it . I wish I could tell you more . p. 60 ESDRAS Let me say too that I have read some words your father said , and you were a son fortunate in your father , whatever the verdict of the world . MIO There are few who think so , but it 's true , and I thank you . Then  --  that 's the whole story ? GARTH All I know of it . MIO They cover their tracks well , the inner ring that distributes murder . I came three thousand miles to this dead end . ESDRAS If he was innocent and you know him so , believe it , and let the others believe as they like . MIO Will you tell me how a man 's to live , and face his life , if he ca n't believe that truth 's like a fire , and will burn through and be seen though it takes all the years there are ? While I stand up and have breath in my lungs I shall be one flame of that fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you must live so . One must live as he can . MIO It 's the only way of life my father left me . ESDRAS Yes ? Yet it 's true the ground we walk on is impacted down and hard with blood and bones of those who died unjustly . There 's not one title to land or life , even your own , but was built on rape and murder , back a few years . It would take a fire indeed to burn out all this error . p. 61 MIO Then let it burn down , all of it ! ESDRAS We ask a great deal of the world at first  --  then less  --  and then less . We ask for truth and justice . But this truth 's a thing unknown in the lightest , smallest matter  --  and as for justice , who has once seen it done ? You loved your father , and I could have loved him , for every word he spoke in his trial was sweet and tolerant , but the weight of what men are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . They 'll not rise again , and their causes lie there with them . JUDGE GAUNT If you mean to say that Bartolomeo Romagna was innocent , you are wrong . He was guilty . There may have been injustice from time to time , by regrettable chance , in our courts , but not in that case , I assure you . MIO Oh , you assure me ! You lie in your scrag teeth , whoever you are ! My father was murdered ! JUDGE GAUNT Romagna was found guilty by all due process of law , and given his chance to prove his innocence . MIO What chance ? When a court panders to mob hysterics , and the jury comes in loaded to soak an anarchist and a foreigner , it may be due process of law but it 's also murder ! JUDGE GAUNT He should have thought of that before he spilled blood . p. 62 MIO He ? JUDGE GAUNT Sir , I know too well that he was guilty . MIO Who are you ? How do you know ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came after , and in all that million words I found not one unbiased argument to fix the crime on him . JUDGE GAUNT And you yourself , were you unprejudiced ? MIO Who are you ? ESDRAS Sir , this gentleman is here , as you are here , to ask my son , as you have asked , what ground there might be for this talk of new evidence in your father 's case . We gave him the same answer we 've given you . MIO I 'm sorry . I 'd supposed his cause forgotten except by myself . There 's still a defense committee then ? JUDGE GAUNT There may be . I am not connected with it . ESDRAS He is my guest , and asks to remain unknown . MIO After a pause , looking at GauntThe judge at the trial was younger , but he had your face . Can it be that you 're the man ?  --  Yes  --  Yes .  --  The jury charge  --  I sat there as a child and heard your voice , and watched that Brahminical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . And now you 're here to winnow out truth and justice-the fountain-head of the lies that slew him ! Are you judge Gaunt ? p. 63 JUDGE GAUNT I am . MIO Then tell me what damnation to what inferno would fit the toad that sat in robes and lied when he gave the charge , and knew he lied ! judge that , and then go to your place in that hell ! JUDGE GAUNT I know and have known what bitterness can rise against a court when it must say , putting aside all weakness , that a man 's to die . I can forgive you that , for you are your father 's son , and you think of him as a son thinks of his father . Certain laws seem cruel in their operation ; it 's necessary that we be cruel to uphold them . This cruelty is kindness to those I serve . MIO I do n't doubt that . I know who it is you serve . JUDGE GAUNT Would I have chosen to rack myself with other men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen only to the voice of law and light , if I had hoped some private gain for serving ? In all my years on the bench of a long-established commonwealth not once has my decision been in question save in this case . Not once before or since . For hope of heaven or place on earth , or power or gold , no man has had my voice , nor will while I still keep the trust that 's laid on me to sentence and define . MIO Then why are you here ? JUDGE GAUNT My record 's clean . I 've kept it so . But suppose with the best intent , among the myriad tongues that come to testify , I had missed my way and followed a perjured tale to a lethal end till a man was forsworn to death ? Could I rest or sleep while there was doubt of this , even while there was question in a layman 's mind ? For always , night and day , there lies on my brain like a weight , the admonition : see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's but one godlike , to judge . Then see to it you judge as a god would judge , with clarity , with truth , with what mercy is found consonant with order and law . Without law men are beasts , and it 's a judge 's task to lift and hold them above themselves . Let a judge be once mistaken or step aside for a friend , and a gap is made in the dykes that hold back anarchy and chaos , and leave men bond but free . p. 64 MIO Then the gap 's been made , and you made it . JUDGE GAUNT I feared that too . May you be a judge sometime , and know in what fear , through what nights long in fear , I scanned and verified and compared the transcripts of the trial . MIO Without prejudice , no doubt . It was never in your mind to prove that you 'd been right . JUDGE GAUNT And conscious of that , too  --  that that might be my purpose  --  watchful of that , and jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendant ! And still I found no error , shook not one staple of the bolts that linked the doer to the deed ! Still following on from step to step , I watched all modern comment , and saw it centered finally on one fact  --  Garth Esdras was not called . This is Garth Esdras , and you have heard him . Would his deposition have justified a new trial ? MIO No . It would not . JUDGE GAUNT And there I come , myself . If the man were still in his cell , and waiting , I 'd have no faint excuse for another hearing . MIO I 've told you that I read the trial from beginning to end . Every word you spoke was balanced carefully to keep the letter of the law and still convict  --  convict , by Christ , if it tore the seven veils ! You stand here now running cascades of casuistry , to prove to yourself and me that no judge of rank and breeding could burn a man out of hate ! But that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAUNT I 've sought for evidence , and you have sought . Have you found it ? Can you cite one fresh word in defence ? MIO The trial itself was shot full of legerdemain , prearranged to lead the jury astray  --  JUDGE GAUNT Could you prove that ? MIO Yes ! JUDGE GAUNT And if the jury were led astray , remember it 's the jury , by our Anglo-Saxon custom , that finds for guilt or innocence . The judge is powerless in that matter . MIO Not you ! Your charge misled the jury more than the evidence , accepted every biased meaning , distilled the poison for them ! JUDGE GAUNT But if that were so I 'd be the first , I swear it , to step down among all men ; and hold out both my hands for manacles  --  yes , publish it in the streets , that all I 've held most sacred was defiled by my own act . A judge 's brain becomes a delicate instrument to weigh men 's lives for good and ill-too delicate to bear much tampering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beam , and say , this once the man is guilty , and I will have it so though his mouth cry out from the ground , and all the world revoke my word , he 'd have a short way to go to madness . I think you 'd find him in the squares , stopping the passers-by with arguments ,  --  see , I was right , the man was guilty there  --  this was brought in against him , this  --  and this  --  and I was left no choice ! It 's no light thing when a long life 's been dedicate to one end to wrench the mind awry ! p. 66 MIO By your own thesis you should be mad , and no doubt you are . JUDGE GAUNT But my madness is only this  --  that I would fain look back on a life well spent  --  without one stain  --  one breath of stain to flaw the glass  --  not in men 's minds nor in my own . I take my God as witness I meant to earn that clearness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is clouded with the blackest , fiercest scandal of our age that 's touched a judge . What I can do to wipe that smutch from my fame I will . I think you know how deeply I 've been hated , for no cause that I can find there . Can it not be  --  and I ask this quite honestly  --  that the great injustice lies on your side and not mine ? Time and time again men have come before me perfect in their lives , loved by all who knew them , loved at home , gentle , not vicious , yet caught so ripe red-handed in some dark violence there was no denying where the onus lay . MIO That was not so with my father ! JUDGE GAUNT And yet it seemed so to me . To other men who sat in judgment on him . Can you be sure  --  I ask this in humility  --  that you , who were touched closest by the tragedy , may not have lost perspective  --  may have brooded day and night on one theme  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ? p. 67 MIO I see well enough . JUDGE GAUNT And would that not be part of the malady  --  to look quite steadily at the drift of things but see there what you wish  --  not what is there  --  not what another man to whom the story was fresh would say is there ? MIO You think I 'm crazy . Is that what you meant to say ? JUDGE GAUNT I 've seen it happen with the best and wisest men . I but ask the question . I ca n't speak for you . Is it not true wherever you walk , through the little town where you knew him well , or flying from it , inland or by the sea , still walking at your side , and sleeping only when you too sleep , a shadow not your own follows , pleading and holding out its hands to be delivered from shame ? MIO How you know that by God I do n't know . JUDGE GAUNT Because one spectre haunted you and me  --  and haunts you still , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is satisfied . He died justly and not by error . A pause MIO Stepping forwardDo you care to know you 've come so near to death it 's miracle that pulse still beats in your splotchy throat ? Do you know there 's murder in me ? p. 68 JUDGE GAUNT There was murder in your sire , and it 's to be expected ! I say he died justly , and he deserved it ! MIO Yes , you 'd like too well to have me kill you ! That would prove your case and clear your name , and dip my father 's name in stench forever ! You 'll not get that from me ! Go home and die in bed , get it under cover , your lux-et-lex putrefaction of the right thing , you man that walks like a god ! JUDGE GAUNT Have I made you angry by coming too near the truth ? MIO This sets him up , this venomous slug , this sets him up in a gown , deciding who 's to walk above the earth and who 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons ; I 'm a god , by Buddha , holy and worshipful my fang , and can I sink it in ! He pauses , turns as if to go , then sitsThis is no good . This wo n't help much . The JUDGE and ESDRAS look at each other JUDGE GAUNT We should be going . ESDRAS Yes . They prepare to goI 'll lend you my coat . JUDGE GAUNT Looking at it with distasteNo , Keep it . A little rain should n't matter to me. p. 69 ESDRAS It freezes as it falls , and you 've a long way to go . JUDGE GAUNT I 'll manage , thank you . GAUNT and ESDRAS go out , ESDRAS obsequious , closing the door GARTH Looking at Mio 's backWell ? MIO Not movingLet me sit here a moment . GARTH shrugs his shoulders and goes toward the inner door . MIRIAMNE opens it and comes out.GARTH looks at her , then at Mio , then lays his fingers on his lips . She nods . GARTH goes out . MIRIAMNE sits and watches Mio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you come here ? MIRIAMNE I live here . MIO Here ? MIRIAMNE My name is Esdras . Garth is my brother . The walls are thin . I heard what was said . MIO Stirring wearilyI 'm going . This is no place for me . MIRIAMNE What place would be better ? MIO None . Only it 's better to go . Just to go . She comes over to him , puts her arm round him and kisses his forehead p. 70 MIRIAMNE Mio . MIO What do you want ? Your kisses burn me  --  and your arms . Do n't offer what I 'm never to have ! I can have nothing . They say they 'll cross the void sometime to the other planets and men will breathe in that air . Well , I could breathe there , but not here now . Not on this ball of mud . I do n't want it . MIRIAMNE They can take away so little with all their words . For you 're a king among them . I heard you , and loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low there was no further , and now a pit opens beneath . It was bad enough that he should have died innocent , but if he were guilty  --  then what 's my life  --  what have I left to do  --  ? The son of a felon  --  and what they spat on me was earned  --  and I 'm drenched with the stuff . Here on my hands and cheeks , their spittle hanging ! I liked my hands because they were like his . I tell you I 've lived by his innocence , lived to see it flash and blind them all  --  MIRIAMNE Never believe them , Mio , never . She looks toward the inner door MIO But it was truth I wanted , truth  --  not the lies you 'd tell yourself , or tell a woman , or a woman tells you ! The judge with his cobra mouth may have spat truth  --  and I may be mad ! For me  --  your hands are too clean to touch me . I 'm to have the scraps from hotel kitchens  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through alleys to sell for dimes or nickels . Go , keep yourself chaste for the baker bridegroom  --  baker and son of a baker , let him get his baker 's dozen on you ! p. 71 MIRIAMNE No  --  say once you love me  --  say it once ; I 'll never ask to hear it twice , nor for any kindness , and you shall take all I have ! GARTH opens the inner door and comes out GARTH I interrupt a love scene , I believe . We can do without your adolescent mawkishness . To MiriamneYou 're a child . You 'll both remember that . MIRIAMNE I 've said nothing to harm you  --  and will say nothing . GARTH You 're my sister , though , and I take a certain interest in you . Where have you two met ? MIRIAMNE We danced together . GARTH Then the dance is over , I think . MIRIAMNE I 've always loved you and tried to help you , Garth . And you 've been kind . Do n't spoil it now . GARTH Spoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know it would happen . We danced together . And the world 's all changed . I see you through a mist , and our father , too . If you brought this to nothing I 'd want to die . GARTH To MioYou 'd better go . p. 72 MIO Yes , I know . He rises . There is a trembling knock at the door . MIRIAMNE goes to it . The HOBO is there shivering HOBO Miss , could I sleep under the pipes tonight , miss ? Could I , please ? MIRIAMNE I think  --  not tonight . HOBO There wo n't be any more nights  --  if I do n't get warm , miss . MIRIAMNE Come in . The HOBO comes in , looks round deprecatingly , then goes to a corner beneath a huge heating pipe , which he crawls under as if he 'd been there before HOBO Yes , miss , thank you . GARTH Must we put up with that ? MIRIAMNE Father let him sleep there  --  last winter . GARTH Yes , God , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? MIO Yes , where ? As if it mattered . GARTH Oh , sleep here , too . We 'll have a row of you under the pipes . MIO No , thanks . MIRIAMNE Mio , I 've saved a little money . It 's only some pennies , but you must take it . She shakes some coins out of a box into her hand p. 73 MIO No , thanks . MIRIAMNE And I love you . You 've never said you love me . MIO Why would n't I love you when you 're clean and sweet , and I 've seen nothing sweet or clean this last ten years ? I love you . I leave you that for what good it may do you . It 's none to me . MIRIAMNE Then kiss me . MIO Looking at GarthWith that scowling over us ? No . When it rains , some spring on the planet Mercury , where the spring comes often , I 'll meet you there , let 's say . We 'll wait for that . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESDRAS enters with JUDGE GAUNT , then , after a slight interval , TROCK follows . TROCK surveys the interior and its occupants one by one , carefully TROCK I would n't want to cause you inconvenience , any of you , and especially the Judge . I think you know that . You 've all got things to do  --  trains to catch , and so on . But trains can wait . Hell , nearly anything can wait , you 'll find , only I ca n't . I 'm the only one that ca n't because I 've got no time . Who 's all this here ? Who 's that ? He points to the Hobo ESDRAS He 's a poor half-wit , sir , that sometimes sleeps there . p. 74 TROCK Come out . I say come out , whoever you are . The HOBO stirs and looks upYes , I mean you . Come out . The HOBO emergesWhat 's your name ? HOBO They mostly call me Oke . TROCK What do you know ? HOBO No , sir . TROCK Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brings it out , trembling TROCK Get back in there ! The HOBO crawls back into his cornerMaybe you want to know why I 'm doing this . Well , I 've been robbed , that 's why  --  robbed five or six times ; the police ca n't find a thing  --  so I 'm out for myself  --  if you want to know . To MioWho are you ? MIO Oh , I 'm a half-wit , came in here by mistake . The difference is I 've got no piece of bread . TROCK What 's your name ? MIO My name ? Theophrastus Such . That 's respectable . You 'll find it all the way from here to the coast on the best police blotters . Only the truth is we 're a little touched in the head , Oke and me . You 'd better ask somebody else . p. 75 TROCK Who is he ? ESDRAS His name 's Romagna . He 's the son . TROCK Then what 's he doing here ? You said you were on the level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff in the papers . We did n't ask him . TROCK God , we are a gathering . Now if we had Shadow we 'd be all here , huh ? Only I guess we wo n't see Shadow . No , that 's too much to ask . MIO Who 's Shadow ? TROCK Now you 're putting questions . Shadow was just nobody , you see . He blew away . It might happen to anyone . He looks at GarthYes , anyone at all . MIO Why do you keep your hand in your pocket , friend ? TROCK Because I 'm cold , punk . Because I 've been outside and it 's cold as the tomb of Christ . To GarthListen , there 's a car waiting up at the street to take the Judge home . We 'll take him to the car . GARTH That 's not necessary . ESDRAS No . TROCK I say it is , see ? You would n't want to let the Judge walk , would you ? The Judge is going to ride where he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in style . Do n't you worry about the Judge . He 'll be taken care of . For good . p. 76 GARTH I want no hand in it . TROCK Anything happens to me happens to you too , musician . GARTH I know that . TROCK Keep your mouth out of it then . And you 'd better keep the punk here tonight , just for luck . He turns toward the door . There is a brilliant lightning flash through the windows , followed slowly by dying thunder . TROCK opens the door . The rain begins to pour in sheetsJesus , somebody tipped it over again ! A cough racks himWait till it 's over . It takes ten days off me every time I step into it . He closes the doorSit down and wait . Lightning flashes again . The thunder is fainter . ESDRAS , GARTH and the JUDGE sit down JUDGE GAUNT We were born too early . Even you who are young are not of the elect . In a hundred years man will put his finger on life itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For you and me we shall die soon  --  one day , one year more or less , when or where , it 's no matter . It 's what we call an indeterminate sentence . I 'm hungry . GARTH looks at Miriamne MIRIAMNE There was nothing left tonight . p. 77 HOBO I 've got a piece of bread . He breaks his bread in two and hands half to the Judge JUDGE GAUNT I thank you , sir . He eatsThis is not good bread . He risesSir , I am used to other company . Not better , perhaps , but their clothes were different . These are what it 's the fashion to call the underprivileged . TROCK Oh , hell ! He turns toward the door MIO To TrockIt would seem that you and the Judge know each other . TROCK faces him TROCK I 've been around . MIO Maybe you 've met before . TROCK Maybe we have . MIO Will you tell me where ? TROCK How long do you want to live ? MIO How long ? Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Well , so far I 've got nothing against you but your name , see ? You keep it that way . He opens the door . The rain still falls in torrents . He closes the door . As he turns from it , it opens again , and SHADOW , white , bloodstained and dripping , stands in the doorway . GARTH rises . TROCK turns p. 78 JUDGE GAUNT To the HoboYet if one were careful of his health , ate sparingly , drank not at all , used himself wisely , it might be that even an old man could live to touch immortality . They may come on the secret sooner than we dare hope . You see ? It does no harm to try . TROCK Backing away from ShadowBy God , he 's out of his grave ! SHADOW Leaning against the doorway , holding a gun in his handsKeep your hands where they belong , Trock . You know me . TROCK Do n't ! Do n't ! I had nothing to do with it ! He backs to the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live  --  well , I do n't give you that much . That 's what you had , six months , and so you start bumping off your friends to make sure of your damn six months . I got it from you . I know where I got it .

Well , He let me get up again and walk till I could find you . That 's as far as I get , but I got there , by God ! And I can hear you even if I ca n't see ! He takes a staggering step forwardA man needs blood to keep going .  --  I got this far .  --  And now I ca n't see ! It runs out too fast  --  too fast  --  when you 've got three slugs clean through you . Show me where he is , you fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops the gunHelp me ! Help me ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! I 'm going to die ! Where does a man lie down ? I want to lie down ! MIRIAMNE starts toward Shadow . GARTH and ESDRAS help him into the next room , MIRIAMNE following . TROCK squats in his corner , breathing hard , looking at the door . MIO stands , watching Trock . GARTH returns , wiping his hand with a handkerchief . MIO picks up and pockets the gun . MIRIAMNE comes back and leans against the door jamb p. 79 JUDGE GAUNT You will hear it said that an old man makes a good judge , being calm , clear-eyed , without passion . But this is not true . Only the young love truth and justice . The old are savage , wary , violent , swayed by maniac desires , cynical of friendship or love , open to bribery and the temptations of lust , corrupt and dastardly to the heart . I know these old men . What have they left to believe , what have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls ' shoes , contrivers of nastiness in the night , purveyors of perversion , worshippers of possession ! Death is the only radical . He comes late , but he comes at last to put away the old men and give the young their places . It was time . He leersHere 's one I heard yesterday : Marmaduke behind the barn got his sister in a fix ; he says damn instead of darn ; ai n't he cute ? He 's only six ! HOBO He , he , he ! JUDGE GAUNT And the hoot-owl hoots all night , and the cuckoo cooks all day , and what with a minimum grace of God we pass the time away . HOBO He , he , he  --  I got ya ! He makes a sign with his thumb JUDGE GAUNT SingsAnd he led her all aroundand he laid her on the groundand he ruffled up the feathers of hercuckoo 's nest ! p. 80 HOBO Ho , ho , ho ! JUDGE GAUNT I am not taken with the way you laugh . You should cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wo n't come back again . TROCK I want the door shut ! He was dead , I tell you ! Esdras closes the doorAnd Romagna was dead , too , once ! Ca n't they keep a man under ground ? MIO No . No more ! They do n't stay under ground any more , and they do n't stay under water ! Why did you have him killed ? TROCK Stay away from me ! I know you ! MIO Who am I , then ? TROCK I know you , damn you ! Your name 's Romagna ! MIO Yes ! And Romagna was dead , too , and Shadow was dead , but the time 's come when you ca n't keep them down , these dead men ! They wo n't stay down ! They come in with their heads shot off and their entrails dragging ! Hundreds of them ! One by one  --  all you ever had killed ! Watch the door ! See !  --  It moves ! TROCK Looking , fascinated , at the doorLet me out of here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handOh , no ! You 'll sit there and wait for them ! One by one they 'll come through that door , pulling their heads out of the gunny-sacks where you tied them  --  glauming over you with their rotten hands ! They 'll see without eyes and crawl over you  --  Shadow and the paymaster and all the rest of them  --  putrescent bones without eyes ! Now ! Look ! Look ! For I 'm first among them ! TROCK I 've done for better men than you ! And I 'll do for you ! JUDGE GAUNT Rapping on the tableOrder , gentlemen , order ! The witness will remember that a certain decorum is essential in the court-room ! MIO By God , he 'll answer me ! JUDGE GAUNT ThunderingSilence ! Silence ! Let me remind you of courtesy toward the witness ! What case is this you try ? MIO The case of the state against Bartolomeo Romagna for the murder of the paymaster ! JUDGE GAUNT Sir , that was disposed of long ago ! MIO Never disposed of , never , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done with it now ! I deny the appeal ! I have denied the appeal before and I do so again ! p. 82 HOBO He , he !  --  He thinks he 's in the moving pictures ! A flash of lightning JUDGE GAUNT Who set that flash ! Bailiff , clear the court ! This is not Flemington , gentlemen ! We are not conducting this case to make a journalistic holiday ! The thunder rumbles faintly . GARTH opens the outside door and faces a solid wall of rainStop that man ! He 's one of the defendants ! GARTH closes the door MIO Then put him on the stand ! GARTH What do you think you 're doing ? MIO Have you any objection ? JUDGE GAUNT The objection is not sustained . We will hear the new evidence . Call your witness . MIO Garth Esdras ! JUDGE GAUNT He will take the stand ! GARTH If you want me to say what I said before I 'll say it ! MIO Call Trock Estrella then ! JUDGE GAUNT Trock Estrella to the stand ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ! He 'll talk ! You thought he was dead , but he 'll get up again and talk ! p. 83 TROCK ScreamingWhat do you want of me ? MIO You killed the paymaster ! You ! TROCK You lie ! It was Shadow killed him ! MIO And now I know ! Now I know ! JUDGE GAUNT Again I remind you of courtesy toward the witness ! MIO I know them now ! Let me remind you of courtesy toward the dead ! He says that Shadow killed him ! If Shadow were here he 'd say it was Trock ! There were three men involved in the new version of the crime for which my father died ! Shadow and Trock Estrella as principals in the murder  --  Garth as witness !  --  Why are they here together ?  --  and you  --  the Judge  --  why are you here ? Why , because you were all afraid and you drew together out of that fear to arrange a story you could tell ! And Trock killed Shadow and meant to kill the Judge out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the thing I 've hunted over the earth to find out , and I 'd be blind indeed if I missed it now ! To GauntYou heard what he said : It was Shadow killed him ! Now let the night conspire with the sperm of hell ! It 's plain beyond denial even to this fox of justice  --  and all his words are curses on the wind ! You lied ! You lied ! You knew this too ! p. 84 JUDGE GAUNT LowLet me go . Let me go ! MIO Then why did you let my father die ? JUDGE GAUNT Suppose it known , but there are things a judge must not believe though they should head and fester underneath and press in on his brain . Justice once rendered in a clear burst of anger , righteously , upon a very common laborer , confessed an anarchist , the verdict found and the precise machinery of law invoked to know him guilty  --  think what furor would rock the state if the court then flatly said ; all this was lies  --  must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , in such cases , holding the common good to be worth more than small injustice , to let the record stand , let one man die . For justice , in the main , is governed by opinion . Communities will have what they will have , and it 's quite as well , after all , to be rid of anarchists . Our rights as citizens can be maintained as rights only while we are held to be the peers of those who live about us . A vendor of fish is not protected as a man might be who kept a market . I own I 've sometimes wished this was not so , but it is . The man you defend was unfortunate  --  and his misfortune bore almost as heavily on me.  --  I 'm broken  --  broken across . You 're much too young to know how bitter it is when a worn connection chars and you ca n't remember  --  ca n't remember . He steps forwardYou will not repeat this ? It will go no further ? p. 85 MIO No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no further than the news went when he died  --  when you found him guilty and they flashed that round the earth . Wherever men still breathe and think , and know what 's done to them by the powers above , they 'll know . That 's all I ask . That 'll be enough . TROCK has risen and looks darkly at Mio JUDGE GAUNT Thank you . For I 've said some things a judge should never say . TROCK Go right on talking . Both of you . It wo n't get far , I guess . MIO Oh , you 'll see to that ? TROCK I 'll see to it . Me and some others . Maybe I lost my grip there just for a minute . That 's all right . MIO Then see to it ! Let it rain ! What can you do to me now when the night 's on fire with this thing I know ? Now I could almost wish there was a god somewhere  --  I could almost think there was a god  --  and he somehow brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain where I could wring this out of you ! For it 's said , and I 've heard it , and I 'm free ! He was as I thought him , true and noble and upright , even when he went to a death contrived because he was as he was and not your kind ! Let it rain ! Let the night speak fire and the city go out with the tide , for he was a man and I know you now , and I have my day ! There is a heavy knock at the outside door . MIRIAMNE opens it , at a glance from GARTH , The POLICEMAN is there in oilskins p. 86 POLICEMAN Evening . He steps in , followed by a SERGEANT , similarly dressedWe 're looking for someone might be here . Seen an old man around acting a little off ? To EsdrasYou know the one I mean . You saw him out there . Jeez ! You 've got a funny crowd here ! He looks round . The HOBO shrinks into his cornerThat 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's him . You mean to say you did n't know him by his pictures ? He goes to GauntCome on , old man . You 're going home . JUDGE GAUNT Yes , sir . I 've lost my way . I think I 've lost my way . SERGEANT I 'll say you have . About three hundred miles . Now do n't you worry . We 'll get you back . JUDGE GAUNT I 'm a person of some rank in my own city . SERGEANT We know that . One look at you and we 'd know that . JUDGE GAUNT Yes , sir . POLICEMAN If it is n't Trock ! TROCK Estrella . How are you , Trock ? TROCK Pretty good , Thanks . p. 87 POLICEMAN Got out yesterday again , I hear ? TROCK That 's right . SERGEANT Hi'ye , Trock ? TROCK O.K. SERGEANT You know we got orders to watch you pretty close . Be good now , baby , or back you go . Do n't try to pull anything , not in my district . TROCK No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my advice quit carrying a gun . Try earning your living for once . TROCK Yeah . SERGEANT That 's an idea . Because if we find any stiffs on the river bank we 'll know who to look for . MIO Then look in the other room ! I accuse that man of murder ! Trock Estrella ! He 's a murderer ! POLICEMAN Hello . I remember you . SERGEANT Well , what murder ? MIO It was Trock Estrella that robbed the pay roll thirteen years ago and did the killing my father died for ! You know the Romagna case ! Romagna was innocent , and Trock Estrella guilty ! SERGEANT DisgustedOh , what the hell ! That 's old stuff  --  the Romagna case . p. 88 POLICEMAN Hey , Sarge ! The SERGEANT and POLICEMAN come closer togetherThe boy 's a professional kidder . He took me over about half an hour ago . He kids the police and then ducks out ! SERGEANT Oh , yeah ? MIO I 'm not kidding now . You 'll find a dead man there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ? And nobody smelled him yet ? MIO PointingI accuse this man of two murders ! He killed the paymaster long ago and had Shadow killed tonight . Look , look for yourself ! He 's there all right ! POLICEMAN Look boy . You stood out there and put the booby sign on the dumb police because they 're fresh out of Ireland . Do n't try it twice . SERGEANT To GarthAny corpses here ? GARTH Not that I know of . SERGEANT I thought so . MIO looks at Miriamne To MioThink up a better one . MIO Have I got to drag him out here where you can see him ? He goes toward the inner doorCa n't you scent a murder when it 's under your nose ? Look in ! p. 89 MIRIAMNE No , no  --  there 's no one  --  there 's no one there ! SERGEANT Looking at MiriamneTake a look inside . POLICEMAN Yes , sir . He goes into the inside room . The SERGEANT goes up to the door . The POLICEMAN returnsHe 's kidding , Sarge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . MIO You 're blind then ! He goes into the room , the SERGEANT following him SERGEANT What do you mean ? He comes out , MIO following himWhen you make a charge of murder it 's better to have the corpus delicti , son . You 're the kind puts in fire alarms to see the engine ! MIO By God , he was there ! He went in there to die . SERGEANT I 'll bet he did . And I 'm Haile Selassie 's aunt ! What 's your name ? MIO Romagna . To GarthWhat have you done with him ? GARTH I do n't know what you mean . SERGEANT To GarthWhat 's he talking about ? p. 90 GARTH I wish I could tell you . I do n't know . SERGEANT He must have seen something . POLICEMAN He 's got the Romagna case on the brain . You watch yourself , chump , or you 'll get run in . MIO Then they 're in it together ! All of them ! To MiriamneYes , and you ! GARTH He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something  --  is n't it true ? You 've dreamed  --  But truly , there was no one  --  MIO looks at her comprehendingly MIO You want me to say it . He pausesYes , by God , I was dreaming . SERGEANT To PolicemanI guess you 're right . We 'd better be going . Have n't you got a coat ? JUDGE GAUNT No , sir . SERGEANT I guess I 'll have to lend you mine . He puts his oilskins on GauntCome on , now . It 's getting late . GAUNT , the POLICEMAN and the SERGEANT go out p. 91 TROCK They 're welcome to him . His fuse is damp . Where is that walking fool with the three slugs in him ? ESDRAS He fell in the hall beyond and we left him there . TROCK That 's lucky for some of us . Is he out this time or is he still butting around ? ESDRAS He 's dead . TROCK That 's perfect . To MioDo n't try using your firearms , amigo baby , the Sarge is outside . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The one that walks when he 's dead ; maybe he 'll walk the distance for you . GARTH Coming back ? TROCK Well , if I come back , you 'll see me . If I do n't , you wo n't . Let the punk go far as he likes . Turn him loose and let him go . And may you all rot in hell . He pulls his coat around him and goes to the left . MIRIAMNE climbs up to look out a window MIRIAMNE He 's climbing up to the street , along the bridgehead . She turnsQuick , Mio ! It 's Safe now ! Quick ! GARTH Let him do as he likes . MIRIAMNE What do you mean ? Garth ! He means to kill him ! You know that ! p. 92 GARTH I 've no doubt Master Romagna can run his own campaign . MIRIAMNE But he 'll be killed ! MIO Why did you lie about Shadow ? There is a pause . GARTH shrugs , walks across the room , and sitsYou were one of the gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ! Go tell your story , only watch your step , for I warn you , Trock 's out gunning and you may not walk very far . Oh , I could defend it but it 's hardly worth while . If they get Trock they get me too . Go tell them . You owe me nothing . ESDRAS This Trock you saw , no one defends him . He 's earned his death so often there 's nobody to regret it . But his crime , his same crime that has dogged you , dogged us down from what little we had , to live here among the drains , where the waterbugs break out like a scrofula on what we eat  --  and if there 's lower to go we 'll go there when you 've told your story . And more that I have n't heart to speak  --  MIO To GarthMy father died in your place . And you could have saved him ! You were one of the gang ! GARTH Why , there you are . You certainly owe me nothing . MIRIAMNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 93 MIO Yes , and you lied ! And trapped me into it ! MIRIAMNE But Mio , he 's my brother . I could n't give them my brother . MIO No . You could n't . You were quite right . The gods were damned ironic tonight , and they 've worked it out . ESDRAS What will be changed if it comes to trial again ? More blood poured out to a mythical justice , but your father lying still where he lies now . MIO The bright , ironical gods ! What fun they have in heaven ! When a man prays hard for any gift , they give it , and then one more to boot that makes it useless . To MiriamneYou might have picked some other stranger to dance with ! MIRIAMNE I know . MIO Or chosen some other evening to sit outside in the rain . But no , it had to be this . All my life long I 've wanted only one thing , to say to the world and prove it : the man you killed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stood and taught in the temple . I can say that now and give my proofs  --  and now you stick a girl 's face between me and the rites I 've sworn the dead shall have of me ! You ask too much ! Your brother can take his chance ! He was ready enough to let an innocent man take certainty for him to pay for the years he 's had . That parts us , then , but we 're parted anyway , by the same dark wind that blew us together . I shall say what I have to say . He steps backAnd I 'm not welcome here . p. 94 MIRIAMNE But do n't go now ! You 've stayed too long ! He 'll be waiting ! MIO Well , is this any safer ? Let the winds blow , the four winds of the world , and take us to the four winds . The three are silent before him . He turns and goes out@@ SCENE : The river bank outside the tenement , a little before the close of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps . The TWO NATTY YOUNG MEN IN SERGE AND GRAY are leaning against the masonry in a ray of light , concentrating on a game of chance . Each holds in his hand a packet of ten or fifteen crisp bills . They compare the numbers on the top notes and immediately a bill changes hands . This goes on with varying fortune until the tide begins to run toward the IST GUNMAN , who has accumulated nearly the whole supply . They play on in complete silence , evidently not wishing to make any noise . Occasionally they raise their heads slightly to look carefully about . Luck begins to favor the 2ND GUNMAN , and the notes come his way . Neither evinces the slightest interest in how the game goes . They merely play on , bored , half-absorbed . There is a slight noise at the tenement door . They put the bills away and watch . TROCK comes out , pulls the door shut and comes over to them . He says a few words too low to be heard , and without changing expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the left , and the 2ND PLAYER , catching that out of the corner of his eye , lingers in a glimmer of light to go on with the game . The IST , with an eye on the tenement door , begins to play without ado , and the bills again shift back and forth , then concentrate in the hands of the IST GUNMAN . The 2ND shrugs his shoulders , searches his pockets , finds one bill , and playing with it begins to win heavily . They hear the dooropening , and putting the notes away , slip out in front of the rock . MIO emerges , closes the door , looks round him and walks to the left . Near the corner of the tenement he pauses , reaches out his hand to try the rain , looks up toward the street , and stands uncertainly a moment . He returns and leans against the tenement wall . MIRIAMNE comes out . MIO continues to look off into space as if unaware of her . She looks away . MIO This rather takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tough weather for a hegira . You see , this is my sleeping suit , and if I get it wet  --  basta ! p. 96 MIRIAMNE If you could only hide here . MIO Hide ? MIRIAMNE Lucia would take you in . The street-piano man . MIO At the moment I 'm afficted with claustrophobia . I prefer to die in the open , seeking air . MIRIAMNE But you could stay there till daylight . MIO You 're concerned about me . MIRIAMNE Shall I ask him ? MIO No . On the other hand there 's a certain reason in your concern . I looked up the street and our old friend Trock hunches patiently under the warehouse eaves . MIRIAMNE I was sure of that . MIO And here I am , a young man on a cold night , waiting the end of the rain . Being read my lesson by a boy , a blind boy  --  you know the one I mean . Knee-deep in the salt-marsh , Miriamne , bitten from within , fought . MIRIAMNE Would n't it be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget my claustrophobia . MIRIAMNE Let me walk with you , then . Please . If I stay beside you he would n't dare . MIO And then again he might .  --  We do n't speak the same language , Miriamne. p. 97 MIRIAMNE I betrayed you . Forgive me . MIO I wish I knew this region . There 's probably a path along the bank . MIRIAMNE Yes . Shadow went that way . MIO That 's true , too . So here I am , a young man on a wet night , and blind in my weather eye . Stay and talk to me . MIRIAMNE If it happens  --  it 's my fault . MIO Not at all , sweet . You warned me to keep away . But I would have it . Now I have to find a way out . It 's like a chess game . If you think long enough there 's always a way out .  --  For one or the other .  --  I wonder why white always wins and black always loses in the problems . White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if white were to lose  --  ah , what then ? Why , in that case , obviously black would be white and white would be black .  --  As it often is.  --  As we often are .  --  Might makes white . Losers turn black . Do you think I 'd have time to draw a gun ? MIRIAMNE No . MIO I 'm a fair shot . Also I 'm fair game . The door of the tenement opens and GARTH comes out to look about quickly . Seeing only Mio and Miriamne he goes in and comes out again almost immediately carrying one end of a door on which a body lies covered with a cloth . The HoBo carries the other end . They go out to the right with their burdenThis is the burial of Shadow , then ; feet first he dips , and leaves the haunts of men . Let us make mourn for Shadow , wetly lying , in elegiac stanzas and sweet crying . Be gentle with him , little cold waves and fishes ; nibble him not , respect his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things ? MIO My dear , some requiem is fitting over the dead , even for Shadow . But the last rhyme was bad . Whittle him not , respect his dying wishes . That 's better . And then to conclude : His aromatic virtues , slowly rising will circumnamb the isle , beyond disguising . He clung to life beyond the wont of men . Time and his silence drink us all . Amen . How I hate these identicals . The French allow them , but the French have no principles anyway . You know , Miriamne , there 's really nothing mysterious about human life . It 's purely mechanical , like an electric appliance . Stop the engine that runs the generator and the current 's broken . When we think the brain gives off a small electric discharge  --  quite measurable , and constant within limits . But that 's not what makes your hair stand up when frightened . MIRIAMNE I think it 's a mystery . MIO Human life ? We 'll have to wear veils if we 're to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made up into sausages we 'd probably make very good sausages . MIRIAMNE Do n't  --  MIO I 'm sorry . I speak from a high place , far off , long ago , looking down . The cortege returns . GARTH and the HOBO return , carrying the door , the cloth lying loosely over itI hope you placed an obol in his mouth to pay the ferryman ? Even among the Greeks a little money was prerequisite to Elysium . GARTH and the HoBo go inside , silentNo ? It 's grim to think of Shadow lingering among lesser shades on the hither side . For lack of a small gratuity . ESDRAS comes out the open door and closes it behind him p. 99 ESDRAS You must wait here , Mio , or go inside . I know you do n't trust me , and I have n't earned your trust . You 're young enough to seek truth  --  and there is no truth ; and I know that  --  but I shall call the police and see that you get safely off . MIO It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . MIO And your terms ? For I daresay you make terms ? ESDRAS No . MIO Then let me remind you what will happen . The police will ask some questions . When they 're answered they 'll ask more , and before they 're done with it your son will be implicated . ESDRAS Must he be ? MIO I shall not keep quiet . A pause ESDRAS Still , I 'll go . MIO I do n't ask help , remember . I make no truce . He 's not on my conscience , and I 'm not on yours . ESDRAS But you could make it easier , so easily . He 's my only son . Let him live . MIO His chance of survival 's better than mine , I 'd say . ESDRAS I 'll go . p. 100 MIO I do n't urge it . ESDRAS No . I put my son 's life in your hands . When you 're gone , that may come to your mind . MIO Do n't count on it . ESDRAS Oh , I count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to him and silently kisses his handsNot mine , not mine , my daughter ! They 're guilty hands . He goes out left . GARTH 'S violin is heard within MIO There was a war in heaven once , all the angels on one side , and all the devils on the other , and since that time disputes have raged among the learned , concerning whether the demons won , or the angels . Maybe the angels won , after all . MIRIAMNE And again , perhaps there are no demons or angels . MIO Oh , there are none . But I could love your father . MIRIAMNE I love him . You see , he 's afraid because he 's old . The less one has to lose the more he 's afraid . MIO Suppose one had only a short stub end of life , or held a flashlight with the batteries run down till the bulb was dim , and knew that he could live while the glow lasted . Or suppose one knew that while he stood in a little shelter of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , from then on , nothing . Then to lie and turn with the earth and sun , and regard them not in the least when the bulb was extinguished or he stepped beyond his circle into the cold ? How would he live that last dim quarter-hour , before he went , minus all recollection , to grow in grass between cobblestones ? p. 101 MIRIAMNE Let me put my arms round you , Mio . Then if anything comes , it 's for me , too . She puts both arms round him MIO Only suppose this circle 's charmed ! To be safe until he steps from this lighted space into dark ! Time pauses here and high eternity grows in one quarter-hour in which to live . MIRIAMNE Let me see if anyone 's there  --  there in the shadows . She looks toward the right MIO It might blast our eternity  --  blow it to bits . No , do n't go . This is forever , here where we stand . And I ask you , Miriamne , how does one spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much that time stands still . MIRIAMNE Why did n't I speak  --  tell them  --  when the officers were here ? I failed you in that one moment ! MIO His life for mine ? Oh , no . I would n't want it , and you could n't give it . And if I should go on living we 're cut apart by that brother of yours . MIRIAMNE Are we ? MIO Well , think about it . A body lies between us , buried in quicklime . Your allegiance is on the other side of that grave and not to me. p. 102 MIRIAMNE No , Mio ! Mio , I love you ! MIO I love you , too , but in case my life went on beyond that barrier of dark  --  then Garth would run his risk of dying . MIRIAMNE He 's punished . Mio . His life 's been torment to him . Let him go , for my sake , Mio . MIO I wish I could . I wish I 'd never seen him  --  or you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my teeth and bones . I ca n't let go or forget . And I 'll not add my lie to the lies that cumber his ground . We live our days in a storm of lies that drifts the truth too deep for path or shovel ; but I 've set my foot on a truth for once , and I 'll trail it down ! A silence . MIRIAMNE looks out to the right MIRIAMNE There 's someone there  --  I heard  --  CARR comes in from the right MIO It 's Carr . CARR That 's right . No doubt about it . Excuse me . MIO Glad to see you . This is Miriamne . Carr 's a friend of mine . CARR You 're better employed than when I saw you last . MIO Bow to the gentleman , Miriamne . That 's meant for you . p. 103 MIRIAMNE Thank you , I 'm sure . Should I leave you , Mio ? You want to talk ? MIO Oh , no , we 've done our talking . MIRIAMNE But  --  CARR I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back because I got worried about you , that 's the truth .  --  Oh  --  those two fellows with the hats down this way , you know , the ones that ran after we heard the shooting  --  they 're back again , lingering or malingering down the bank , revisiting the crime , I guess . They may mean well . MIO I 'll try to avoid them . CARR I did n't care for the way they looked at me.  --  No luck , I suppose , with that case history ? The investigation you had on hand ? MIO I ca n't say . By the way , the stiff that fell in the water and we saw swirling down the eddy , he came trudging up , later on , long enough to tell his name . His name was Shadow , but he 's back in the water now . It 's all in an evening . These things happen here . CARR Good God ! MIO I know . I would n't believe it if you told it . CARR But  --  the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's dunked for good this time . That 's all that 's happened . p. 104 CARR Well , if you do n't need me  --  MIRIAMNE You had a message to send  --  have you forgotten  --  ? MIO I ?  --  Yes , I had a message  --  but I wo n't send it  --  not now . MIRIAMNE Then I will  --  ! MIO No . Let it go the way it is ! It 's all arranged another way . You 've been a good scout , Carr , the best I ever knew on the road . CARR That sounds like making your will . MIO Not yet , but when I do I 've thought of something to leave you . It 's the view of Mt . Rainier from the Seattle jail , snow over cloud . And the rusty chain in my pocket from a pair of handcuffs my father wore . That 's all the worldly goods I 'm seized of . CARR Look , Mio  --  hell  --  if you 're in trouble  --  MIO I 'm not . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I go , and guards me now . I 'm fine . CARR Well , that 's good news . He 'll have his work cut out . MIO Oh , he 's a genius . CARR I 'll see you then . I 'll be at the Grand Street place . I 'm lucky tonight , and I can pay . I could even pay for two . p. 105 MIO Thanks , I may take you up . CARR Good night . MIO Right , Carr . CARR To MiriamneGood night . MIRIAMNE After a pauseGood night . CARR goes out to the leftWhy did you do that ? He 's your genius , Mio , and you let him go . MIO I could n't help it . MIRIAMNE Call him . Run after him and call him ! MIO I tried to say it and it strangled in my throat . I might have known you 'd win in the end . MIRIAMNE Is it for me ? MIO For you ? It stuck in my throat , that 's all I know . MIRIAMNE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hoped Garth could go clear . MIO Well , now he will . MIRIAMNE But you  --  It was your chance ! MIO I 've lost my taste for revenge if it falls on you . Oh , God , deliver me from the body of this death I 've dragged behind me all these years ! Miriamne ! Miriamne ! p. 106 MIRIAMNE Yes ! MIO Miriamne , if you love me teach me a treason to what I am , and have been , till I learn to live like a man ! I think I 'm waking from a long trauma of hate and fear and death that 's hemmed me from my birth  --  and glimpse a life to be lived in hope  --  but it 's young in me yet , I ca n't get free , or forgive ! But teach me how to live and forget to hate ! MIRIAMNE He would have forgiven . MIO He ? MIRIAMNE Your father . A pause MIO Yes . Another pause You 'll think it strange , but I 've never remembered that . MIRIAMNE How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were a little older  --  if I knew the things to say ! I can only put out my hands and give you back the faith you bring to me by being what you are . Because to me you are all hope and beauty and brightness drawn across what 's black and mean ! MIO He 'd have forgiven  --  Then there 's no more to say  --  I 've groped long enough through this everglades of old revenges  --  here the road ends .  --  Miriamne , Miriamne , the iron I wore so long  --  it 's eaten through and fallen from me . Let me have your arms . They 'll say we 're children  --  Well  --  the world 's made up of children . p. 107 MIRIAMNE Yes . MIO But it 's too late for me . MIRIAMNE No . She goes into his arms , and they kiss for the first timeThen we 'll meet again ? MIO Yes . MIRIAMNE Where ? MIO I 'll write  --  or send Carr to you . MIRIAMNE You wo n't forget ? MIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , too , from now on , and whatever roof or stars I have to house me , you shall share my roof and stars and morning . I shall not forget . MIRIAMNE God keep you ! MIO And keep you . And this to remember ! if I should die , Miriamne , this half-hour is our eternity . I came here seeking light in darkness , running from the dawn , and stumbled on a morning . One of the YOUNG MEN IN SERGE strolls in casually from the right , looks up and down without expression , then , seemingly having forgotten something , retraces his steps and goes out . ESDRAS comes in slowly from the left . He has lost his hat , and his face is bleeding from a slight cut on the temple . He stands abjectly near the tenement p. 108 MIRIAMNE Father  --  what is it ? She goes towards Esdras ESDRAS Let me alone . He goes nearer to MioHe would n't let me pass . The street 's so icy up along the bridge I had to crawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and then he held me there  --  I swear what I could do I did ! I swear to you I 'd save you if I could . MIO What makes you think that I need saving ? ESDRAS Child , save yourself if you can ! He 's waiting for you . MIO Well , we knew that before . ESDRAS He wo n't wait much longer . He 'll come here  --  he told me so . Those damned six months of his  --  he wants them all  --  and you 're to die  --  you 'd spread his guilt  --  I had to listen to it  --  MIO Wait  --  He walks forward and looks casually to the right , then returnsThere must be some way up through the house and out across the roof  --  ESDRAS He 's watching that . But come in  --  and let me look .  --  MIO I 'll stay here , thanks . Once in and I 'm a rat in a deadfall  --  I 'll stay here  --  look for me if you do n't mind . p. 109 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof  --  He goes in hurriedly MIO Looking upNow all you silent powers that make the sleet and dark , and never yet have spoken , give us a sign , let the throw be ours this once , on this longest night , when the winter sets his foot on the threshold leading up to spring and enters with remembered cold  --  let fall some mercy with the rain . We are two lovers here in your night , and we wish to live . MIRIAMNE Oh , Mio  --  if you pray that way , nothing good will come ! You 're bitter , Mio . MIO How many floors has this building ? MIRIAMNE Five or six . It 's not as high as the bridge . MIO No , I thought not . How many pomegranate seeds did you eat , Persephone ? MIRIAMNE Oh , darling , darling , if you die , do n't die alone . MIO I 'm afraid I 'm damned to hell , and you 're not damned at all . Good God , how long he takes to climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIO I 'll follow him . p. 110 MIRIAMNE He 's there  --  at the window  --  now . He waves you to go back , not to go in . Mio , see , that path between the rocks  --  they 're not watching that  --  they 're out at the river  --  I can see them there  --  they ca n't watch both  --  it leads to a street above . MIO I 'll try it , then . Kiss me . You 'll hear . But if you never hear  --  then I 'm the king of hell , Persephone , and I 'll expect you . MIRIAMNE Oh , lover , keep safe . MIO Good-bye . He slips out quickly between the rocks . There is a quick machine gun rat-tat . The violin stops . MIRIAMNE runs toward the path . MIO comes back slowly , a hand pressed under his heart MIRIAMNE Oh , God , forgive me ! She puts an arm round him . He sinks to his kneesWhere is it , Mio ? Let me help you in ! Quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't thought to choose  --  this  --  ground  --  but it will do . He slips down MIRIAMNE Oh , God , forgive me ! MIO Yes ? The king of hell was not forgiven then , Dis is his name , and Hades is his home  --  and he goes alone  --  p. 111 MIRIAMNE Why does he bleed so ? Mio , if you go I shall go with you . MIO It 's better to stay alive . I wanted to stay alive  --  because of you  --  I leave you that  --  and what he said to me dying : I love you , and will love you after I die . Tomorrow , I shall still love you , as I 've loved the stars I 'll never see , and all the mornings that might have been yours and mine . Oh , Miriamne , you taught me this . MIRIAMNE If only I 'd never seen you then you could live  --  MIO That 's blasphemy  --  Oh , God , there might have been some easier way of it . You did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You did n't send me away  --  ? MIRIAMNE Oh , never , never  --  MIO Forgive me  --  kiss me  --  I 've got blood on your lips  --  I 'm sorry  --  it does n't matter  --  I 'm sorry  --  ESDRAS and GARTH come out MIRIAMNE Mio  --  I 'd have gone to die myself  --  you must hear this , Mio , I 'd have died to help you  --  you must listen , sweet , you must hear it  --  She rises I can die , too , see ! You ! There ! You in the shadows !  --  You killed him to silence him ! She walks toward the pathBut I 'm not silenced ! All that he knew I know , and I 'll tell it tonight ! Tonight  --  tell it and scream it through all the streets  --  that Trock 's a murderer and he hired you for this murder ! Your work 's not done  --  and you wo n't live long ! Do you hear ? You 're murderers , and I know who you are ! The machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GARTH runs to her p. 112 GARTH You little fool ! He tries to lift her MIRIAMNE Do n't touch me ! She cawls toward MioLook , Mio ! They killed me , too . Oh , you can believe me now , Mio . You can believe I would n't hurt you , because I 'm dying ! Why does n't he answer me ? Oh , now he 'll never know ! She sinks down , her hand over her mouth , choking . GARTH kneels beside her , then rises , shuddering . The HOBO comes out . LUCIA and PINY look out ESDRAS It lacked only this . GARTH Yes . ESDRAS bends over Miriamne , then rises slowlyWhy was the bastard born ? Why did he come here ? ESDRAS Miriamne  --  Miriamne  --  yes , and Mio , one breath shall call you now  --  forgive us both  --  forgive the ancient evil of the earth that brought you here  --  GARTH Why must she be a fool . ESDRAS Well , they were wiser than you and I. To die when you are young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but the devils locked in synod shake and are daunted when men set their lives at hazard for the heart 's love , and lose . And these , who were yet children , will weigh more than all a city 's elders when the experiment is reckoned up in the end . Oh , Miriamne , and Mio  --  Mio , my son  --  know this where you lie , this is the glory of earth-born men and women , not to cringe , never to yield , but standing , take defeat implacable and defiant , die unsubmitting . I wish that I 'd died so , long ago ; before you 're old you 'll wish that you had died as they have . On this star , in this hard star-adventure , knowing not what the fires mean to right and left , nor whether a meaning was intended or presumed , man can stand up , and look out blind , and say : in all these turning lights I find no clue , only a masterless night , and in my blood no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet is my heart a cry toward something dim in distance , which is higher than I am and makes me emperor of the endless dark even in seeking ! What odds and ends of life men may live otherwise , let them live , and then go out , as I shall go , and you . Our part is only to bury them . Come , take her up . They must not lie here . LUCIA and PINY come near to help . ESDRAS and GARTH stoop to carry Miriamne
