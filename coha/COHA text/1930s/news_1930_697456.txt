txt The Navy Department 's 1931 program for building up the fleet to conform to the provisions of the London Naval Treaty calls for an authorization of nearly $100,000,000 for new construction and about $40,000,000 for the modernization of the battleships New Mexico Mississippi and Idaho . The construction program includes one aircraft carrier , one 10,000-ton cruiser armed with 6-inch guns , a destroyer flotilla probably of six vesvels and three or possibly four submarines . The program is regarded as modest in view of the fact that practically every destroyer in the fleet or in reserve will be obsolete and therefore replaceable under the terms of the treaty before its expiration on Dec. 31 , 1936 . It is conservatively estimated that the cost of a treaty navy would involve an expenditure of about $1,000 , - 000,000 , and if the 1931. recommendation is an indication of the construction policy to be followed during the life of the treaty it would ittrPar that the United States has no present intention of undertakingall the new construction necessary for naval parity with England and to establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Treaty Navy . If the 1931 recommendation is approved by the President and enacted by Congress and is duplicated in the succeeding five years that/ the treaty will remain in force , the total American expenditure would be in the neighborhood of $600,000,000 , or $400 , - 000,000 less than the sum needed to build up the various warship classes to treaty strength . The new aircraft carrier would be a sister ship of the carrier authorized , the contract for which will be about $19,000,000 . These two new ships , if the second is authorized , will bring the aircraft tonnage of the navy to 93,000 tons , leaving a margin of 42,000 tons which the United States can lay down and complete during the operation of the London pact . The carrier Langley is not included , since that vessel is of the experimental - type and is not charged against the aircraft tonnage fixed for the United States in the treaty . The destroyer tonnage of the navy under the provisions of the treaty is 150,000 tons , 16 per cent of which can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The vessels to be built within the remaining tonnage must not exceed 1,500 tons . Destroyer Fleet Remains Large . While the existing destroyer fleet of the United States is the greatest of any navy , practically every vessel included in the more than 250,000 tons still afloat is fast approaching the replaceable age fixed for vessels of this class . There is every reason to believe that as many of the old destroyers as possible will be reconditioned and that new construction ; will not exceed 50,000 tons . A destroyer costs about $2,800 ai ton to build . The new destroyers . if of the treaty limit , would therefore cost a , little more than $5,000,000 each , while if they are of the 1,500-ton type , the cost would be about $4,000,000 each . The treaty limit for submarines is 2,000 tons , and at $3,500 a ton , which is the average cost , a submarine of the maximum size would cost in the neighborhood of $7,000,000 . The projected 10,000-ton cruiser will , if authorized , be the first of her class built for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omaha type in service carrying 6-inch guns ? but the Omaha 's displacement ig only 7,500 tons . At London the American delegates insisted that the same maximum ton-t nage , that is 10,000 , should apply Us vessels mounting 6-inch guns as tai those armed with the more powerful 8-inch weapons . The new vessel recommended is , therefore , largely , an experiment on the success ox falure of which the future construe* tion of such ships will largely dee pend . The cost of the cruiser on ths basis of $1,800 a ton would be about $18,000,000 . No cruisers of the 8-inch gun tree. * type are included in the 1931 program , since the eighteen of that class allotted to the United States , sixteen of which can be ' completed before the expiration of the treaty , have already been authorized by Congress . The seventeenth such ship can be commissioned Jan. 1 , 1937 , or the day following the expiration ' Of the treaty . The eighteenth cannot. be completed before 1938 or one year after the pact ceases to operate . Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three will be ready for commission early next year and six are under construction . The completed ships are the Salt Lake City , Pensacola , Northampton , Houston , and Chester . Those nearing completion are the Louisville , Chicago and Augusta , while the six , the construction of - which - was recently started , are the New Orleans , Astoria , Minneapolis , Portland , Minneapolis and No. 38 . Number : 37 will be started in 1932 , No. 39 in 1933 , No. 40 in 1934 , and No. 41 in 1935 . The modernization of the battleships New Mexico , Idaho and Mississippi was a part of the naval program submitted to the first session of the present Congress , which failed of enactment . Every effort will be made to get action on these ships in the short session which begins in December . The $40,000,000 involved in their reconditioning is not included as a part of the new construction program . The navy construction along the general lines outlined will probably be submitted to President Hoover within a week or ten days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a questiononly he . can answer , but naval officers and the advocates of a treaty navy in Congress are very hopeful .
