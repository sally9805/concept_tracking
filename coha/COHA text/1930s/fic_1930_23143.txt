RHAPSODY IN MAUVE A STORY BY LETITIA PRESTON RANDALL S UNDAY morning was just like any other morning to Marian Johnson , with the exception that it did not include shopping in town . She lay on the davenport in the living room reading Safari and dreaming of some tall and ardent man with whom she would some day go to Africa and lead such an adventurous life . Not that she wanted to shoot wild animals , or even photograph them ; but a man who could do all those things would be a wonderful companion , and she would look very stunning in clothes appropriate for the jungle . But Marian resolved never to stay for two years , as the other Mrs. Johnson had . Two years was such a long time to be away from New York , and besides a permanent wave lasted only six months , No man like Martin Johnson had ever come into her life . Only Fred . But some day a man like that would come , and then Fred would just have to suffer . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Marian held out her slender white arms and tried her lovely hands in various poses . Beautiful , beautiful arms and hands . For that matter , quite unusually beautiful shoulders . Marian regarded the slim length of leg sheathed in clinging flesh-colored underwear and sheer stockings . It was almost overwhelming to realize that she possessed so much physical beauty . It seemed too bad that it should be wasted on one man . Marian had never been noble enough , or sufficiently bad , to give herself en-tirely to any other man , but she had scorched herself beautifully any number of times and was always involved in the delightful intricacy of a secret love affair . There was always one man madly in love with her , and frequently several . It was Fred 's fault , however , Marian justified herself . She knew that he had several times been seriously interested in other women . Marian always knew when , and it was only during these times that she showed any interest in him . While she did not care for Fred with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to have him . It was never difficult for Marian to win Fred back , and it was rather nice to feel that she had this power . Fred had grown old-looking and fat and yet he was only a few years older than Marian . But Marian felt that she had not changed . She was forty-three , but admitted only thirty-seven . Six years meant very little to her . As a matter of fact , Fred did n't even know Marian 's age . He had once , but she had lied about it so long that he had forgotten . It was now a secret that lay between Marian and God , and Marian was often sorry that even God knew . How on earth she had ever thought Fred Johnson fascinating  --  and she had thought so once  --  she could n't understand . Now his name annoyed her as much as other things . Mrs. Fred Johnson . It was so terribly commonplace . It was a name that did not look well on a visiting card or in the society columns of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little better . If the Johnson only had a t in it . Mrs. Frederick Walter Johnston . At once it was lifted out of mediocrity and became almost distinguished . How the little things counted in life . It was like drawing all the various quiet colors in a room together with a jade-green vase or a vivid bit of tapestry . Think of a simple little letter of the alphabet making all that difference . Marian knew by heart all the maxims of interior decorating . She knew the different periods and had other ways of telling a Sheraton table than by the legs . It was most amazing . She created rages in Curtis Manor Hills , the suburb in which she lived . It was Marian who laughed at ash trays fastened to the arms of chairs ; and in a day a number of them disappeared from otherwise comfortable homes . It was Marian who flung a mandarin coat in careful disorder across the back of her davenport and caused an unprecedented run on the local gift shop for them . Hers was a luminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she lay there on the davenport . She knew , for she had studied interior decorating , that pictures should be hung on a level with your eyes when standing . She knew the distance small pictures should be from larger ones , and how many inches the pictures should be from tables and tables from chairs . She knew where to put vases , and why . Indeed , there was very little that Marian did not know about interior decorating , and few things in life that she could not measure to see if they belonged where they were . She had long ago learned all there was to know about Fred , and now he seemed an incredibly dull man , boring her to the point of distraction . That was why she became interested in other men , she thought . There had been a time when she had wanted to know Fred 's every thought . If he were a long time silent she would ask , " What you thinking about ? " Surprised , Fred would say , " Nothing , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Truly , it was nothing . " Marian 's curiosity was piqued by the fact that Fred was quite evidently embarrassed . her desire grew . It was now necessary for her to know what it was he was thinking about , and so she nagged him into telling , pouting and sitting on his lap until this was accomplished . " I was just wishing that I looked distinguished in a dinner coat . " There was something terrible about his chagrin , and how he hoped she would say , " And you do , Fred . Nicer than any man I know . You 're awfully distinguished looking . " But Marian only laughed . She got up from Fred 's lap and went back to her own chair , satisfied now , triumphant . Yes , she knew all there was to know about Fred , she thought . Other women might find him interesting , but she did not . Was it possible that there was an electric spark between Fred and other women , a bright something which was suddenly struck into being at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself with other men ; but on looking at Fred , she doubted if he ever possessed that divine something able to call forth the answering spark . To her he was only a fat man whose stomach rumbled and who told his dreams . She realized that he could play no real part in her life . He had never told her that her eyes were oriental , that she was all mystery and stillness and passion . But Dick Fulton had . Marian was so accustomed to adulation that it was some time before she became aware of the depth of Dick 's feeling for her . It was not a surprise , as no man 's adoration was ever a surprise to her . It was the night she came back from the club dance in Dick 's roadster , while Mollie rode with Fred , that things reached a decided climax . This friendly exchange of husbands and wives was one RHAPSODY of their little jokes . Each man thought his own wife above suspicion but his neighbor 's willing . Each woman hoped her husband was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , after he had put Marian in , and when he touched the wheel his hand was trembling in a most adolescent manner . He leaned towards Marian . " Marian  --  you 're so beautiful . " One by one the other cars honked away , veering from one side of the road to the other in degrees controlled by the amount of cocktails the drivers bad drunk . Marian was in green with copper beads , waist long . She had on her long topaz earrings . She was like an Egyptian goddess . Marian thought so too . They were the last ones to leave the club grounds . The attendants were closing windows and sweeping up broken glass . Dick put his hand over Marian 's . He was startled by its coolness , and the topaz in her ring was sharp and as cold as ice . His own hand was moist . A shudder ran through him , but Marian was unmoved . Dick was just like all men , a little awkward at first . " You 're the sort of woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prin-cess -- -Marian stirred . This was more like it . Dick found his arms had stopped trembling now and he put them about her , strongly . His lips were on hers . Marian 's arms went about his neck . Her eyes were no longer remote and cool , but burning brightly . She was sorry she had worn her long beads and hoped they would not break in the car . She must remember not to wear them again until this affair with Dick was over . The next morning Dick sent her tall red roses . Fred always sent pink , when he sent any , which he so rarely did now . Dick wrote on the card , " These are for you . These are you . " At dinner Fred said , " Bless my soul , old girl , you had to buy yourself some roses again . I should send them oftener . Why do n't you remind me ? " Poor old Fred was so dumb and he had no soul , thought Marian . That morning she had buried her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked in her mirror and decided that she was rather like a slender red rose . Last time Morton Davis had sent her orchids he said she was like one . " My rare girl " he called her . Marian regarded herself carefully . No , a red rose was more appropriate . But Marian was soon bored with Dick . All men were exactly alike , she found , except for the color of their hair and eyes . She found that after a short time they were all more interested in her body than in the rareness of her personality . Of course she could not blame them , but it was so untidy and dangerous and required constant care to keep things on a safe basis . She enjoyed watching men desire her , but she could never give herself . She was too fastidious , and far too wise . But Marian juggled men very successfully . She always sent them away feeling they had known one good woman at least . Now she must get rid of Dick . The last time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dick , dearest , " she said , being very tense and worried , " this ca n't go on . We love each other too much . " " I know , " Dick said forlornly . " It 's too wonderful to last . " " There 's Mollie  --  and Fred . We must think of them . " " Marian , you 're so good . " Marian said , " Hold me close , Dick , and say good-by . I 'll never forget you  --  never  --  never . I 've never known any man like you , Dick . " " Marian  --  Marian  --  you 're so won-derful . " There was real anguish in his voice , but in Marian 's there was only a great relief . That was the way she liked to have them go . That was the way they usually went There had been one exception when Tom Craig told her that she was worse than any streetwalker to lead men on and then give them worse than nothing . " You 're what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it had been dreadful . She was glad when Tom 's business had taken him to another city . But usually they left feeling that Marian was a good woman . They remembered her for a long time afterwards . Marian lay there on the davenport thinking about Dick and missing him . She never held men until they grew tired . It was far better to miss them . She wondered what man would now enter her life to fill in those endless , uninteresting days until the day when she would have her big moment . Some day she would meet a man who would carry her away to Africa , who would carry her away whether she wanted to go or not . But she would want to go . Marian knew that . Soon Fred would come back from church and into the living room and be cheerful and affectionate . Jolly and fat . How Marian detested jolly , fat men . She liked lean men with compelling eyes , dark and adoring . She hoped she would n't have to spend all Sunday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contract . Marian was an exceptionally good player . She had an actual contempt for women who played bridge badly . She reasoned that that was something anyone could learn and when a woman did n't want to it was just sheer laziness and that 's all . It was certainly a great social asset . Even money did n't count in their little suburb when you could play a good game of bridge . It was a great deal more important than having a detached house or a foreign car or being in the New York social register . Bridge made Marian think of her nails and she glanced at them appraisingly . She buffed them on her bare arm . Nice nails . A little too pointed and pink , but men liked them that way . " Rose petals " one man had called them . That settled it as far as Marian was concerned . Other styles might come and go , but Marian would always have pointed nails , provocatively pink . She heard Fred come in the front door and knew that be would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me , sir . " It was one of his jokes , and she knew that he always expected to hear her laugh , and of course she never did . " Well , lady bug , " Fred said , as he leaned over to kiss her . " How are you and all the family ? " Fred had such silly names for her and said such stupid things . She could n't begin to remember how many times he had said just that . " How are you and all the family ? " or " How are you and the children , ma'am ? " He was forever talking about children anyway , but Marian had never wanted any . It was inconceivable that life should go on and on and on -- with Fred . " Darn good sermon this morning , " Fred said conversationally , but Marian made no response . He went on , hopefully . " That man Elton is all right . I like him . You might ask him in for dinner some evening . You know  --  entertain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how can you be so ridiculous ? " Fred turned to go upstairs . " Well , it was just a suggestion , Mrs. Johnson . He 's a regular guy and they say he 's a knockout with the ladies . " A minister ? There was something interesting about the idea . " All right then , ask him , " Marian said , hoping her voice showed the right amount of annoyed acquiescence . In her varied career Marian had never come in close contact with a minister . Years ago , yes , but ministers , like figures , had changed since then . At least Marian hoped so . It would be dreadful if something gaunt and spiritual turned up . Still , Fred had said he was a knockout with the ladies . Fred took it as a matter of course . One would have thought having the minister to dinner was a frequent occurrence . " I 'll call him up to-day , " RHAPSODY IN MAUVE he said . " Would Tuesday be all right for you ? " At first Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind or to plan just the right setting ; but afterwards Marian could hardly wait . She wished , violently , that she had said Monday . It seemed impossible to wait so long for an adventure promising something different from any other she had ever had . Marian knew enough about ministers and frustrations to know that , properly directed , such an affair would be tremendously interesting . Furthermore , a minister would n't tell anything . It made things so safe . It never entered Marian 's head to invite him for any purpose other than that of conquest . She could never think of men impersonally ; they were creatures to awaken , and she was never happy unless she had completely captivated them . Monday morning she arranged the living room . She put all the substantial books she could find on the tables and took from the bookshelves all those she liked best . The minister must not think her shallow . Marian had bought a good many sets of books to fill up her shelves and in bindings to match her rugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too bad she had had to put away that limp-leather edition of Kipling . Books about the jungle might awaken his primitive instincts . Still , even to help matters along , Marian could not have red books in a room with a copper rug . It was too jarring on her nerves . She was glad she had all of Conrad in that lovely deep-sea blue . It made quite a nice pool of color in an otherwise gloomy corner . Candles everywhere , she thought . There was something mysterious and stirring about candles . Other people might find their dim glow peaceful but it exhilarated Mariah . It awakened her soul , she often said . Now Marian 's every thought centered about Tuesday evening . Once some remnant of her youthful regard forministers and for the church made her pause and wonder why she would deliberately plan this affair . " Am I bad ? " she wondered , but she concluded that she was not . " No , I 'm not like other women . I 'm full of life and the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm like Cleopatra , like Sarah Bernhardt and Isadora Duncan , like the great lovers of all ages . It was born in me . I simply ca n't fight a great force like that . Women like me fire men to action . " Then she began to think about Fred and , bitterly , that her marriage to him had been a gigantic mistake . Perhaps Doctor Elton would be her fate . Perhaps they would go together to the jungle . He would be a missionary and she his inspiration . But before she got off the boat , where she had been the only woman and the center of an adoring group of young scientists and writers , Annie clumsily interrupted her to find out the menu for dinner . Marian planned a hearty dinner , for all men , however spiritual , liked to eat and ministers were always poorly fed . Her dinners were always built around what men liked . She never had food with a low-caloric value to please her women guests . Marian preferred to have frank compliments from well-fed men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you certainly know how to feed people . I have n't had such a dinner in years . " It was a great satisfaction to Marian to know that when she invited men to dinner they wanted to come . " You bet your life ! " When she and Fred were alone she had dainty salads and things that appealed to her Eesthetic sense and kept her without an ounce too much flesh . Fred never complained no matter what she had . So Marian planned bean soup and steak for Doctor Elton , and other substantial foods . For dessert she would have something chocolate . All men liked chocolate . It was a safe dessert to have . That evening Marian wore white . All white was so virginal . In the dining room she would throw a scarlet scarf about her shoulders . The virgin and the flame , or something like that , she thought . But when she first greeted Doctor Elton she would be all in white and would try to be coming down the stairs as he entered the door . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room she would not be able to use her flame-colored scarf because of the rug . That copper rug had been a dreadful mistake . It kept Marian from wearing red in her own home , and red was such an exciting color . But there in the candle light in her chaste dress she would make a lovely picture . " No cocktails Tuesday , Fred , " Marian said just before dinner was announced on Monday evening . " Well I should hope not ! What do you think I am ? " Fred was indignant . " Besides , I do n't think we should have cocktails every night before dinner anyway . " " I do n't either , " Marian agreed . She wanted to get in the proper mood for Tuesday . Immediately , though , she wished she had n't said that . " It must have been my Better Self , " she thought . She wanted a drink desperately . Doctor Elton was tall and dark , and when he spoke his voice was low and vibrant . Marian kept thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed such a dreadful waste of physical perfection . Most any man could be a minister . Ministers could be anmic or bow-legged and still have beautiful souls . It was simply unbelievable that anyone as good-looking as Doctor Elton should be one . Marian decided that he should have been a doctor . She wondered if he were too old to begin the study . Fred was most affable and tried to tell incidents of his boyhood . When Fred had been to church or felt spiritually uplifted for any reason he always became reminiscent . Sometimes cocktails affected him the same way . " Well , Doctor Elton , that reminds me of the time I wore my first derby to church . It had a green lining and when the boys saw that they . . . " But Marian interrupted . " Tell me , Doctor Elton , " she said . " Do you find the world growing worse ? " Doctor Elton met this hardy perennial as if it had been a rare and beautiful thought . He had never seen anyone so lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frankly , I do n't , " he said . " I feel that all this flare-up will pass away and the next generation will revert to our old standards . I have great faith in the human race . " " Things do change . I remember when I was a boy a girl who smoked cigarettes was considered .. . " But Fred was ignored . " I think you are right , " Marian agreed , and she said it in such a way that Doctor Elton was in a warm glow . " It is such a relief to talk to someone who knows . I get so bored with this inane life we lead here in Curtis Manor Hills . I often long for some difficult work to do , something that would take me out of myself . " Fred said , " I feel like that , too . I 'll tell you people an interesting experience I had once . My mother . . . " But no one heard him , and his voice drifted into silence . Marian went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minister 's wife I should have made " ; but , really , until that moment , such a thought had never entered her head . " Wonderful ! Wonderful ! You 'd be an ideal helpmate , " said Doctor Elton , and meant it . His own wife , now in the hospital with the fourth little Elton , whom he had not mentioned or even thought of until that moment , did not have such provocative curves as Mrs. Johnson . She did not have such smooth white shoulders or slender white hands that were tipped with little flames . His wife was stringy and had liver spots , and she sniffled when she ate soup . With a wife like this glorious creature before him he could do wonders . Already she was a new inspiration . Already she had awakened in him thoughts and ambitions he had not had for years . Later , in the living room in the mellow light , they sat on the davenport and talked . Fred made several attempts to enter the conversation , but Marian paid no attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgent , pastoral way . Finally he started tinkering with the radio . Under cover of the music , " An Hour of Old-Fashioned Gems , " Marian 's conversation grew more personal . Fred 's foot was tapping the floor in time to " Listen to the Mocking Bird . " He wanted to tell them that the first girl he ever had used to play that with variations , but he knew they would n't care . Marian said , " I 'd love to see you often , Doctor Elton . You know I have no one to talk to . I 'm not a woman who gives her confidence to everyone , but know you would understand the real me . I need someone to help me . I . . . " Her voice broke helplessly . For the briefest part of a second Doctor Elton put his hand over hers lying there so near , so very near his own . " There , there , " he said , " we will help each other , for I feel that you understand me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps everything would have been all right if Marguerite Kelvin had n't told her about her brother who was a writer . " You must meet him , Marian . He 's really wonderful . He 's spent two years in the South Sea Islands among the natives , and his book is all about them . " That started Marian thinking , and the way Doctor Elton ate olives decided the matter . It had been such a strain living up to his expectations . She wanted to smoke , to have cocktails instead of tea when he came in the afternoons , but he thought her so different from other women . She had never even dared to kiss him . It was all most exhausting . Really , that night at dinner when she noticed him eating olives in such a depraved way she was quite relieved . It gave her a definite reason for breaking away . They were particularly large olives , and he ate them as if they had been apples . When he had nibbled the last bite possible , and of this he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it rattled against his teeth . Who , thought Marian , could love a man who eats olives that way ? The next time they were alone in the afternoon she said , " You know , I am growing so desperately fond of you that I ca n't see you again . " Doctor Elton half rose from his chair . " No ! No ! " He was genuinely grieved at her decision . His whole attitude towards life had been different since he had met Mrs. Johnson . Not only were his sermons more inspiring , but he himself had felt uplifted . Marian patted the place beside her on the davenport . " Come , " she said , and Doctor Elton came , though his knees were trembling . " I wonder if you know how much you have begun to mean in my lifer Marian said , convincing herself that she was now being noble . Doctor Elton cleared his throat . He wanted desperately to speak , but no words came . Marian went on , " Once in a woman 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we have met too late . I am married and you are married , and this can not go on . I love you too much . " " You are noble  --  noble , " said Doctor Elton . It was at this point in the conversation that men always said something like this . " Kiss me before you go , and pray for me , " Marian said . Doctor Elton drew her towards him , and his lips met hers , lingered there , and kissed her as ardently as twenty years of suppression would permit . His kiss , thought Marian , was exactly like the way he ate olives . It was best this way . After all , ministers were too narrow . One must live broadly . A writer would understand her better . A writer must know all emotions , and someone like Marguerite 's brother who had lived in the South Seas would understand her warm nature and would not censure her . She would inspire his greatest novel . Of course Fred would miss her . He would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love one must be ruthless . She stirred in Doctor Elton 's ecclesiastical arms , and he ceased nibbling at her lips . " You must go , my very dear , " she said , and was happy that she had remembered to say something so exquisitely poetic . He stumbled down the three steps to the street and went back to his wife with the liver spots , to his four children , and jello desserts . He had known one really noble woman . Marian watched him go . " He has made me a better woman , " she said to herself . When he was out of sight she went to the telephone . There was still time to have Marguerite and her brother over for cocktails . She inhaled a cigarette . Now she felt free . At the telephone she waited for Marguerite to answer . The South Sea Islands . It was a barbaric and beautiful place . Warm , exotic nights . . . What a pity she was not a blonde . She would be so utterly distinctive amid so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives , her skin would be quite white and alluring . Marguerite could come . Her brother was terribly bored , she said . Marian went upstairs to change to a red dress . Red was savage and stimulating . They could have the cocktails in the sun room .
