Adr PORTRAIT OF AN ACTRESS BY BESSIE BREUER W EARING my bogus pearls , a black silk coat and a scowl , I invoked the name of the famous actress to the melancholy doorman and hesitated through the dusty gloom until I came upon an alley at the end of which under a few lights moved several sad and darkly dressed and moody men and a young woman whose back was turned to me and who wore an expensive green suit slouchily draped over her slight figure , a gorgeous fox fur on her shoulders , and a few locks of blond hair straying outside her tan felt hat . A tall young man whose oxford flannels moved to accommodate the beauty of his flanks , with blond waving hair , a fresh complexion , and a fresh English voice , was being put through his paces . He was so young , so fresh , so glowing that the rest of the men looked old and rather dusty by comparison . Gray sat on their neatly pressed black suits , gray film over their faces turning sallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color and atmosphere of all the men grouped under the lonely lights save this young blond god , all light and glowing and bright . Youth at its thinnest and shiniest seemed his , for neither his voice , his body , nor his eye displayed any of the modulations of passion , of brooding , or of yearning inherent in a young man of artistic pretensions who is to flower into a man of capacities . " Yes , yes , yes , I understand , perfectly , " he was saying , clipping his words with English superbness , to the young star who stood with her back to me giving him instructions . " Let us try that bit over , " she said . Her voice surprised me . Not grandiloquent , not one tone in the convention of stage English . Rather flat its tones , in key as silver is to gold , a dull sheen in the voice , low in the throat , yet clear with alto precision , a young voice , brushing down over words and bringing them out clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawling ease . " Now , if you will please walk over to the door of the gambling room . The doorman flings it open , and you enter crying , ' Banco , Banco ! " The young man walked over to one corner as anyone would walk anywhere on an aimless errand , turned a bit slowly , and repeated , " Banco , Banco , " as one should say " Ikw d' you do , How d' you do " to an utter stranger at a reception , high , quick , and thin with polite condescension . " No , no , " said the star . " Will you come back ? You see , " she said quietly , " you are very excited . You have been given a one thousand pound note by a beautiful woman you have never seen before . The bidding is high , and you want to stop the proceedings at once . Everything is exciting at the moment , and the players are interested only in the table  --  so you must go up to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , yes , I understand perfectly , " said the young than hastily , and so he tried it over again , and almost to the same effect . " No , no , you did n't quite get it , " said the star gently . Why he was not bounced off the boards I could not understand . And the rest of the company stood around gloomily , and the director in shirtsleeves said not one word through all this . He only held the script . " I will show you , " she said to the young man . " I say to you , ' Here , take this and break the bank . ' You say , Why ? ' etc. , etc. , and then you look deeply into my eyes , kiss my hand , and walk like this " ? the slender little body before our eyes grew tall and nervously animated as she walked to the imaginary door , brushed the fancied doorman aside and , clutching her banknote in her hand , gave out a cry in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled . " Banco ! " she cried , and the whole stage echoed with the intonations , " Banco ! " When the dark theater grew quiet again and emptied of her magnificent challenge , she said again quietly , patiently , " Like that . You understand ? Now do try it again . " Again and again it went on , and still the young man was not much better , and still the company stood intent , respectful , watching , rehearsing about this young man , and I wondered why she did not give the part instead to the well-setup and better equipped actor who was evidently the villain in the play ; but her patience , her endurance , her kindness , and gentleness towards the young debutant was endless . During a pause she came over to me and made an arrangement to be interviewed a few days later . I had been told she was the most difficult woman in the theater , but she was simple and friendly and cordial , and I left , to come back to thetheater one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wore no hat , and her yellow hair , half crinkled , half straight , showed darker patches beneath . Her face looked worn and fallen and blotched , and she wore a rather soiled blue silk dress , and on her feet were red bedroom slippers with limp silk pompons . This time she was acting . She was falling to the floor , a maid was rushing to her , a man was running through the French window calling for help . Over and over she fell , and while on the floor half rose and passionately gave everyone instructions ? to the insufficiently bewildered maid , to the not vehement enough villain to " throw me down hard , as if you meant it . " . It was hot and frantic and terrific in pace . And , just as she was , she rose from the dusty boards , put on a coat , jammed a hat on her head , and we got into a taxi . " You wo n't mind , " she asked , " if I go to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some clothes . " I did mind but could n't say so , and the taxi drew up before one of those elaborate French renaissance chateaux just a few doors from Fifth Avenue ; and she ascended the steps of the white stone mansion with the pink pompons on her feet and the abstracted dignity of an empress . The liveried footman moved not a muscle of his jaw as he elaborately opened the plate-glass doors for us , and the aristocratic saleswomen , in their svelte black clothes , with their keen , cruel eyes , smiled good evening to her and attended her effusively as they showed her straight into a fitting room . " I 'll tell Mr. Brady you 're here . " " Send the fitters in right away . I 'm in a hurry . " She threw her clothes off as she spoke and made no move to arrest the process as a delicate young man with graceful hips entered . " H'lo , Lonny , " she said , " I 'm in a hurry . Where 's the silver dress ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how 's the girl ? " " Tired , tired as hell and I got to go to a party to-night . Been rehearsing since ten o'clock , and all I had to eat was a malted milk . It 's the only thing I can digest , I 'm so nervous now , but I 'll have to cut it out . Look , " she pinched up a tiny roll of fat skin with her two bands , " it 's making me fat . " " You can stand that much , " he advised , " it 's good for you . " " No . I wo n't have it . I do n't want an ounce of flesh . When I 'm on the stage I want every part . of me to be thin and supple , to move .. . Here we are . " She turned to the black-dressed severe-looking women who came toward her with things over their arms . " First , mademoiselle , " said the older one , with glasses , a sour look , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit exactly . This material it is so expensive it must be cut just right . " " Yes , but I want it tight , tight , you understand ? " Yes , mademoiselle . Certainly , mademoiselle , " said the head fitter , and two of them rapidly sewed the slight young woman clad in pink underwear into a canvas bag . " Tighter , " she urged . " Here , look . " She drew in her stomach and pulled out the loosened material . " Sew in all that . I want it to be so tight that when I breathe the dress will-move with me , when I move my shoulder or my hip it will show right through the dress . " " Yes , but certainly . " " But you ai n't doing it . Why do n't they do what I tell them anyhow ; what the hell is this ? " she complained to Mr. Brady . " She 'll do just what you say , " he tried to soothe her and went on talking about a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " he went on with small talk . " What 'd she wear ? " she asked . " She 's the one girl that can make a Chanel gown look like a Fourteenth Street bargain  --  it 's God 's gift . Just a dressed-up farm girl gone wrong , with that high makeup and that ugly mug . " " Oh , she 's a good girl , Carrie , and so funny . " And then he went on a long drooling story of what she said and he said . " No by God , I want it low  --  low , here , gim me the scissors . " She grabbed the scissors and cut the canvas almost down to her waist and turned back the material so that her whole bosom was bare ? " And in the back still lower , just past my waistline I want it . " " It is too low , mademoiselle . The shoulder-straps will fall off , It will not stay like that . " " Of course it will after I show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better dressmaker than any of these dames you got here . Take a piece of net and sew the back d  --  colletage to it ; that will hold the whole thing in place . I want the dress to stay on me no matter what I do . I wear it in a violent scene  --  I fall around and everything . But the dress must stay on my body and be part of my body  --  you understand ? Use flesh-colored net right up to the neck in the back ; from the audience it will be invisible . ... Noon ? , cut more out under the arms . More . I'do n't want a lot of goods on me  --  the front should just cover my bust ? It should look like it will slip off any moment and show everything , but the trick is that it wo n't , see ? ? the net in the back will hold it in place  --  excitement and no risk . I do n't care whether the shoulder-strap stays on my personal gowns ; if it falls off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , " he echoed , " give ' em a show . " " These are nature 's own rosebuds , so why be stingy with your friends ? With my hair down and a shy rosebud peep-ing , why be weeping ? What a poet was lost when I fell on the stage at the age of three . My God , how tired I am ! Five days rehearsing twelve hours a day to work that boy in . But he 's gon na be just great . He 's a real lead . He 'll show up Jerry Bristol for the ham that he is . Gee , I 'm in real luck . You know last year when I was in Antibes , playing around with Harry , there was this kid floating around , in his crowd . He kinda stuck in my mind , and when Jerry got high hat and acted like he was the star instead of me , I said let him go . If you give him what he wants , an even salary break with me , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . . . Well , they had to let that barn out because I 'm the girl that can put any bum play over for a Broadway run . But I had to get somebody pretty quick to take his place . Suddenly I thought of this English boy , so I telephone Harry and say , ' Harry , remember that English buy that played around with us last summer ? Do you think he would come over and play opposite me if I cabled him ? " Cable him ! ' he just yelled through the ' phone . ' Why , he 's here , right here in the room withme ! He landed off the boat yesterday and is looking for a job . send him right over ! ' Did you ever hear of anything so marvelous ! Planned by fate ! And he 's simply great ! ... All right , suppose you do have to rip it off me to get it off , rip it off then , who cares ? And put big strong hooks and eyes all along that side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , because you can bet strain them when I 'm working in the dress . " " It will be beautiful on you , made-moiselle . " " I told you I knew more about dressmaking than you do , did n't I ? Now , where is my suit , Lonny , why are n't they hurrying it along ? I ca n't stand here all night . " She stood there in hersleazy pink shorts and brassiere , talking to Lonny , telling him about the party she was going to to-morrow night . " It 's at Mary 's . I 'm going to take the kid along , so I want to look swell . I have n't got a thing to wear . Say , maybe I could borrow that gold jacket just for one night , whaddyu say , Lonny ? " " I do n't know , " he murmured sympathetically , with a cold look in his eye , " but I 'll go and see . " " Sure , go and see . I only want to borrow it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before you close and have it in the place in the morning . . You know I got to look nice . I ca n't have these big black and blue marks showing on my arm , or first thing you know they 'll say , ' There 's that Carrie again , dead drunk and had a fight , her hair down already and black and blue marks all over her . It 's simply disgraceful ! ' You know how they are , the cats ! I want to look nice and sweet because I 'm going to take my new lead . He 's never met Mary , and I want to show him the whole works . Be sweet and get me the coat , like a good boy . " " I 'll try , " he again murmured engagingly . " Here 's your suit now , " and he left the room to go to the court of highest appeal . The suit was beautiful . Long and of green tweed  --  she put it on herself lovingly , disregarding the clumsy hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur reaching up and swathing the neck and bringing out all the lightness in her skin and hair and erasing all the worn marks . Then she tried on the hat . " It 's all wrong , " she said to the milliner , " all wrong . I wo n't have a brim waving all over creation . The brim should be tiny , just big enough to take the crown away from my face . This is the second time , You 'll never get it right . Here , let me rip it , and hand me some pins . I 'll pin it up right by myself . " And standing there and waiting on herself , she pinned up a hat with the sureness of a Madame Reboux , all the more unerring in that it was a very severe cloche , made of the same tweed as the suit , and only the most exact eye and skilled hand could give it just the right line . " There now , " she said when she had finished the pinning , " sew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surveying herself and liking herself in the suit . " What news ? " she asked the young man , who had returned . " I 'm sorry , there 's nothing doing . .. it 's against the rules . " " But , Lonny , I 'm having it copied for the play , why ca n't I have the original just to loan for myself for one night ? " " I explained all that , but it ca n't he done . " " Well , that 's pretty funny , with all the customers I 'm bringing here . I let you use me for photographs for Vogue and Harpers Bazaar , and this is all the thanks I get . . . . What 's the bill for this suit anyhow ? You know I 'm paying for this myself , so go easy , will you ? " " It 's not much . I think four hundred and fifty . " " Four fifty ! " she exclaimed , " four fifty ! You 're robbing me . Why , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods for a hat . I wo n't pay it . For Pete 's sake , go and get a better price on it . " " I 'll try , " he again said engagingly , left , and returned murmuring disconsolately , " I 'm sorry , that 's the price . " She was furious , and with justice , I thought . I began to doubt the existence of the invisible goddess of extortion . I began to suspect the smoothness and the pleasantness and the joviality of this charming young man with the flexible hips who was calling allthese great actresses by their first names and exchanging gossip about them and going on parties with them . But at any rate this star did not suspect him . She exonerated him while she poured execrations on the invisible head of the establishment , at the same time that she turned round and round before the mirror , surveying herself and loving her image . . . . Soon we were out in the street again , the obsequious doors closing behind her  --  to what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malice of : She thought she could get away with it . . . the nerve of her . . . the gold coat from Poiret .. . just for one evening . . . Why , she 'd bring it back in shreds , if she ever did . As if we did n't know that careless Carrie who forgets to give back a fox fur after she 's posed in it . . . And trying to get her suit for nothing  --  bribing with her custom . . . It 's little enough we make on her clothes with all the tearing up of models and putting them together again a different way every time she tries them on . . . . I could hear the poison dripping out of fangs dried from obsequiousness while she stood there in her rumpled , sleazy underwear with her lean bang legs , sometimes speaking the English of an Oxford don and sometimes of a New York gutter rat , running up and down the whole scale of English sound , making a clown of herself and of her position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold coat to hide the bruises on her arm .. . . " My country place is open but I have n't a place in town . . .. I 'm using a friend 's house while she 's off in Hollywood , " she said on the way . We stopped on a street off Central Park and went into a private house . She nodded to the stern-faced housekeeper who opened the door but did not stop until we were up on the drawing-room floor . " I 'll go up and take off my things , and we 'll have our talk . I 'm sorry I had all that fitting to do , but we 're opening Monday in New York , and the clothes have got to be done . We 'll have a bit of supper and talk . " I began to follow her up the stairs , thinking that was what she wanted . " No , " she cried sharply , " do n't come up . I 'll be down in a second . " So I went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a second . When she came down she seemed miraculouslyquieter and rested , and easy . She sank down on the other end of the divan , and turned to the lamps which swung above and switched on the rosy lights . " What do you say ? " she asked . " Let 's just eat off a tray so I can sit here and rest while you 're interviewing me . " It sounded fine , so she rang a bell , and up came the frigid servant to whom she communicated her orders , and presently we each had in our laps a tray of flat , unappetizing food . So we sat and ate the food and she said , " What was the interview to be about ? " and I said , " It 's a beauty article , you know . You tell your beauty secrets , like Elsie Ferguson and Jane Cowl , and all the rest , as I told you before . " " You never told me that . " " But I did . The first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consented , and said you 'd sign your name to it . I 'll write every word down exactly as you say it , so it will really be yours , as though I were a stenographer . " " But I 'll never tell you my beauty secrets , " she insisted vehemently . She dropped her fork and knife and leaned forward . " I 'll tell no one my beauty secrets . Why should I ? They would n't be beauty secrets any longer , would they ? " " No , " I conceded . " But it would be good publicity . " " I do n't care a damn about publicity . I do n't need publicity . I never give interviews . I never let my name be signed to fake articles  --  I do n't need it . Let the others do it ; they need it , I do n't . " " But you said you would , " I insisted , annoyed at having wasted all these days and weeks trailing her , badgered by my magazine , badgering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " Did I ? Well , it does n't matter . I wo n't do it . You do n't suppose I 'm going to give away for nothing what it costs me hundreds of dollars to get . I pay Madame Le Gene seven hundred dollars for ten treatments . That 's all I 'll tell you . You can go to her and ask her what they are , and see what you get , but I 'll never tell . I get my money 's worth , and I 'll keep on getting it  --  but for myself only . The hell with the rest of them . . . . I do n't need anybody , I do n't need any publicity . I make my own publicity at the box office . I make my own plays . I 'm the only actress on the stage that 's author-proof . Ha , ha ! I say what I want to when I 'm on the stage , and that 's what makes my plays a success . My managers know that , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're dumb . " " But there 's something you can say about beauty that women will like to hear , " I urged , wanting to get something out of this lost opportunity ? " some generalities about beauty you can say that will be your own and interesting . " " Generalities ? A lot I know about generalities and nothing about beauty . I 'm no beauty , so what do I know about it ? All I know is that I want love , admiration . . . that 's all I know and if I know any tricks that get that , well , I wo n't tell what they are . . . . I want to be loved . I want to be loved . " She leaned back against the cushions , relaxed , her face aglow under the warm honey-rose light , her head thrown back as if she were receiving imaginary bloom all over her come suddenly -- kisses . " I want love , " she repeated , from where ? I asked myself , from Pan- " I ca n't live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? and no noise I could make I want to be admired . I want a man all awakened her . And I thought of her day long to say to me , ' You arc lovely . handsome young man coming at eight , You are wonderful . You are the most and it was twenty minutes to eight , and wonderful girl in the world . You are I touched her , and then shook her , but marvelous . ' That 's what I want . she did not move . So I went downSweet words , attentions , to have stairs and said to the housekeeper that flowers .. . to go to dances . . . I Miss Borden was asleep and should I love to dance . . to go out for a drive waken her ; that she had an important with his shoulder pressing into mine ? appointment at eight . that 's what I want  --  admiration , love " Let her sleep , " sourly pronounced . . . not to sleep with a man . the oracle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to take shows she needs a rest . " me out ; we 're going to see Ethel No use telling that sourface anything , Barrymore . It 's the first time . . . I thought to myself as I went back up You know that lovely English boy the stairs . . . no use telling her that 's my new lead ? Is n't he just about love ; and I sat down beside the wonderful ? Is n't he the most beauti sleeping beauty , and she began to ful thing you ever saw ? I 'm so ex struggle in her sleep and she cried out , cited . I want to look beautiful for " I do n't want you . You 're not my him . And to-morrow I 'm going to man any more . Do n't ! . God ! take him to a party to Mary 's . Let 's I do n't care . I 'll never be your woman hurry and get through .

Oh , God . . has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't care for her She should have been down here with . . . you 're not my man any more . . . the car and Stokes at seven and they you 're not my man . . . . " have n't showed up yet , the devils . I sat there chilled with hearing , I 'll fire them both out . " unable to go away , hearing her moans , " Let 's start with a definition of her cries of distress , of torture . What beauty , " I hazarded , but there was no should I do ? It was getting on towards answer . She was lying there asleep eight . No maid had come up the between her last word and the question . stairs . I began to shake her again , to I spoke to her again . No , she was lift her out from the soft cushions ; but sound asleep . I looked at her . All she dropped back limp , as if drugged , I rounded out her face was now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I relovely as some sentimental dream of peated with a question in my mind . I youth , all rose-colored , and honey- looked at the clock again . Ten mincolored at the edges going into the utes to eight , eight minutes to eight , golden hair , and the arch of her brows , five minutes to eight . I arose and thin yet sharp , the fine curve of fine started down the stairs , and the outside spun hair , and her high cheekbones door opened towards me , and the glowing under a flush of rose color , the handsome young blond clad in an rise of satiny eyelids over her large eyes , Inverness and a white silk scarf and a and the pointed small chin and the face top hat , and looking a veritable Apollo shaped like a heart , and the softly ris of the Metropolis , entered and jumped ing , the lovely languor of the bosom , up the stairs two at a time , and his arm and her fingers curled up like lily petals curved round a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So beautiful , with a glossy box  --  gardenias , probably . " Miss Borden is asleep , " I answered to his polite good evening and led him to the divan . Our voices , or the movement , or something , wakened her . " What is it ? " she sat up and asked wildly . " You 're here already ! I 'm not dressed . What time is it ? My God ! Eight o'clock ! They did n't wake me ! I fell asleep . So tired rehearsing . Why did n't you wake me ? " She turned on me accusingly . " I tried to , " I said . " You did n't ! You did n't ! It 's a lie ! " she accused me fiercely , turning to the young man . " This is terrible ! What shall I do ? And my maid has n't come yet . " " It does n't matter , " I cut in , dispassionate in the various stresses of feeling that played about me . " You can dress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out my hand for her , and so did the young man , and I went up the stairs behind her , calming her , telling her she had plenty of time , and I would help and she 'd manage and all that . We entered two small and modest bedrooms . She sat down on a bed and began stripping , asking me to look for her lace stockings , and I got them and some fresh underwear , and brought them to her . I looked at her sitting there on the bed , pulling on her stockings . Naked , she was still another woman . She had a surprisingly long torso , and her back was flat , with no swelling of flesh , no dimples ; straight and strong the spine ran up her flat back , pricking it to points through the thin white skin . There was no modulation of swelling hip , no indentation of waist , and above the flattish barrel of torso hung two small and rather shapely breasts . I examined her sharply because I knew she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these secrets of her power ; and here was a strange and unfeminine body , the bones in her arms long and flat , and the arms thin and bending backwards at the elbow , and her naked legs had long lean strips of muscle striping through the skin , but the lovely thinnish lower legs of a child , and I said to myself , " This is a beautiful woman , " for she really was a beautiful woman , with that body and all . Just then a stolid black woman walked in . She was overwhelmed with questions , exclamations , curses . But she scarcely answered , letting the questions and the curses rain against her unheeding like a rock . So I said to the actress , " You wo n't need me now , will you ? " " No , " she replied , and did n't even thank me , and went on scolding her maid and dressing nervously , and throwing things about . So I went downstairs , and the beautiful young man was sitting beautifully at the piano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft light was pink shaded , and the glossy white box was open , and they really were gardenias , and all the stage properties were high-toned and romantically familiar and correct . Breath of young love , I said to myself , rather envying , and to the young man , " Miss Borden will he down in a few moments . " But he looked right past me , and no thanks from him either . They 're stars , I 'm just feeding them lines , I said to myself . Breath of love , melting itself all over the piano , in tinkling false phrases , thin and light and pink like the shaded lamp . Breath of Young Love , I said to myself , bleakly walking down the stairs ; and up above a naked girl with no dimples on her was cursing her maid . . . Lying under a rose light softly gushed Jike a rose , jerking in her sleep . A few nights later I went up to her theater . The back door opened right on a view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown so vehemently discussed with her dressmakers . It fitted her like the skin of a mermaid , and was as glittering with every movement , every deep breath , every passionate stir of her body . Seen from where I stood , her beauty was unreal , wraithlike , hninous  --  a mirage for which men die . Her voice was sending out an aura of magnetic power over the whole audience and , caught in its magic atmosphere , her young man , too , glowed with virility and assurance , caught flame and reacted to the real love and infatuation that vibrated from her . The stage fairly glittered with the romance that holds people spellbound , the sad gray men and the timid maid , all assured and shining , moving in the rhythm of her passionate art . When she was through she passed by me , still aflame , hearing nothing , seeing nothing , breathing like an exhausted swimmer . She disappeared into her dressing room for a few moments , and then emerged and , going up to a ladder which led into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook it and shook it , working herself into a gasping exhaustion . And drawing deep breaths , she went on the stage in an extremity of physical collapse as one who comes in from having received some overwhelming emotional shock  --  trick of an actress  --  holding that enormous mass of people somewhere there in the darkness with the authority of her intensity . I abandoned my attempt to speak to the sibyl in her divine frenzy , to break into the dream that was being woven so powerfully before my eyes that night . I heard later she had gone on the road and that the young man was a success , which meant only that so long as she held him fascinated by the wonder of this new and important intimacy with a great actress so much older than he so long would lie be adequate for his part , sinking into his own vacuum only when she withdrew the vapors of her emotion which buoyed him up . Presently therewere reports of her non-appearance for scheduled performances , complaints of managers , emotional scenes , illness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tour abandoned . I guessed at the cause of this debilcle when I saw in the pictorial section of a Sunday newspaper the photograph of a tall young man whose Oxford flannels moved to accommodate the beauty of his pose , looking out of the glossy brown length of half a page . On his face now the assured , complacent smile of the blooded male , under his feet the caption that he was to be married within the week to a wealthy debutante . Her manager , dark and nervous , with a cigar and a worried smile , almost snorted when I mentioned her name . " Just one more trick like this and we 'll break her . She 's got to learn she 's not bigger than the theater . She 's at the Wharton , but I tell you honestly you 'll be wasting time trying to get that copy OK 'd . Why , I been after her for weeks . I telegraphed . I telephoned to her , Chicago , Indianapolis , all her stops ; she would n't talk to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make her talk about her new contract , but she would n't see me , mind you . I do n't know what she 's up to . After all I 've done for her and stood for . I 'm sorry , young lady . " I tried her telephone anyhow , and a secretary , answering , asked me after a few moments ' wait to come up at noon . At noon the actress was sitting up in her bed in a yellow-lace nightdress and an embroidered and lace cover over the hotel bed , a secretary going in and out of the room , and a maid ironing in the room beyond . I was shocked by her face ; for fatigue and suffering had made her look momentarily as she would ten years later . Her throat was puckered in the first loose flesh that foreshadows middle age , and her blond hair , though freshly yellowed , - 41 ? was brittle in its curl and framed the puffy brown eyes all too clearly . " Hullo , " she called out to me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Did n't know I had such grand thoughts . I 'm game for that series you want . I 'm through with the stage . I 'll expose the managers . I 'll break them . They 'll see whether they can force me . I 'm above rules . I 'll never step on the stage again  --  unless everything goes the way I say . " Her monologue went on . She lighted one cigarette after another . " I 'll quit . I got plenty of money . I 'll do charity or something . . . . They ca n't force me . " The telephone rang . Answering it , her voice changed immediately . Docile , na  --  ve , transparent the voice , full of goodness and gentleness . " I 'd love to work for you . You 've always been my ideal of a manager . No , you did n't get it quite straight . . . It 's double my former percentage . . . . Oh , no , double . . . . My lawyer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can do great together . . .. Yes , it 's a swell play . . . . I 'd love to put it over . .. . I 've got a lead who 'll be perfect opposite me . Sure .

We 'll put the thing over big . " She hung up the telephone , the pantomime dropped from her face , but the bell rang again . . .. Honey her voice became , drawling and low with swooning sweetness . " Yes , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got grand news for you . " She flung back the lace covers . The article slipped to the floor . " Do n't fuss about that , " she called back to me as she ran into the bathroom . " Stay for lunch and we 'll go over it afterwards . I 've got a play just made for me . It 's a smash . Good for a three years ' run . . . . Wait till you see my new lead . He 's coming up now . A rich boy . A real gentleman . No phony English for me . He 's a natural . All he has to do is walk on the stage and be himself . That 's a knockout " The secretary entered with a blond young man immaculately clothed and of middling height and uncertain blue eyes , the vigor of some powerful ancestor refined into a small delicate nose , a delicate chin hung round with bulgy cheeks already drooping with sentimental self-indulgence , and a diffident , hesitating manner , yet charming . He warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song for you , " he said , still standing , his attitude and voice a mingled apprehensiveadoration . " How lovely , " she cried with full-throated exuberance . " Do sing it . Do sit down . " He sat down on the edge of the chair and leaned forward , his hands nervously tightened on a roll of music paper he had drawn out of his pocket . Ina thin tenor half-voice , he sang : " As the vio ! et is true So am I to you Do de vo do I love you . As the sun shines bright So do I delight Do de vo do do in you . " " How wonderful ! " She was all ecstasy and surprise . " Do you like it ? " he asked . " It was an inspiration . It 's just like you , is n't it ? " " It 's simply wonderful . Please sing it again , please , " she urged , leaning out of her seat . With the high hard sunlight of noon etching the bright varnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shiny bureau etching her wrinkled throat with hard precision and the fresh yellow hair and the puffy eyelids , he crooned : " As my heart drinks deep So do I repeat Vo de do do I love you .. . Vo de do do do do do do de do . " His voice swelled in interminable chorus and verse . A glow came over her skin . Like a bud swelling and unfolding shedding a mysterious magic aura , so she bloomed in the hard sunlight and became young , lovely , adorable . .. . " It 's wonderful , " she barely breathed her ecstasy . She leaned over to the young man , took his hand and stroked it , her voice lilting in languorous murmured rhythms : " Let 's go out to some little Italian place where we can be alone together . . . some place where they have pink table lights and wine .. . just you and me alone together . " She leaned over the charmed young man fairly enfolding him in the perfumes and essences of her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing , transparent flesh , purring , relaxed , abandoned to her new delight . The young man leaned forward to the ecstasy which lay like a screen before her sad parched eyes . THE LISTENING HORSES BY LEE ANDREW WEBER T HESE with the thick black manes are the listening horses  --  I know them by their long hair and the wonder in their eyes . They explore the wide fields of the midnight skies , Following the stormy paths and the comet courses . These are the listening horses . Their nostrils quiver , They scent the bitter lightning in the cool night air . Up among the stone hills their stormy manes of hair Drag in the waters of the deep black river . With their black manes dripping and their black legs shaking They pound their sable thunder on the stubborn hill , Till in the little village that was somnolent and still The houses are trembling and the people are waking .
