President Hoover , attempting to estimate the national charity which will be needed next winter ( see p. 8 ) , last week announced : " There is a test , and a very positive test by which the success of relief can be determined . That is , the effect of distress upon public health . I have some years of experience in dealing with problems of distress and relief , and we have always tested the efficacy of relief by the reflex in public health . " <P> He had called on the chief of the nation 's health army , Surgeon General Hugh Smith Gumming , for the health figures of 1928 , when jobs were plenty , for comparison with the health figures of the two Depression years . Surgeon General Gumming promptly replied with batteries of comparable statistics and with comments . <P> With a practiced eye that knew what it was going to find ( the Surgeon General reported the nation unusually healthy last winter-TIME , Dec. 15 , 1930 ) , the President scanned Dr. Cumming 's data and with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gumming report shows that the general mortality , the infant mortality , the sickness in the country was less in the winter of 1931 than the winters of full employment in 1928 and 1929 . The public health has apparently never been better than it has been over the past six months . It is a most creditable showing of the effort which the country made last winter and one for which the voluntary organizations and local officials are entitled to a very great deal of credit . " <P> As the Germans have noted since the War , poverty forces frugality . Frugality prevents overeating , stimulates healthy exertion , resistance to disease . The current flare-up of infantile paralysis in &; around New York City is seasonal , local , was dying down last week .
