Come to judgment in Manhattan last week and this were the works of more than 50 U. S. artists of all ages , regions and schools , salted with a sprinkling of solid or exotic Europeans . In the lot were no new efforts by the three lusty young men from the West-Benton , Curry and Wood-by whom contemporary U. S. painting is best known to the man in the street . Fresh examples of surrealism were not in evidence , the familiar ones being stock-in-trade with Manhattan dealers or on loan exhibitions in the eager Midwest . But among many pictures by young artists , critics recognized a few of well-founded ability and vivid promise . <P> Southern Star , In the last 20 years the South has produced fiercely regional literature by the bale , but almost no first-rate painters . This week one star risen from the bayous was shining bright in an exhibition at the Boyer Galleries of 19 paintings by 26-year-old John McCrady of New Orleans , his first one-man show in Manhattan . Born and bred in the South , John McCrady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarships to Manhattan 's Art Students ' League in 1933 . The unusually cold winter depressed him . He quit going to classes , stayed in his room hugging the radiator and telling himself he was no good until one day he began to paint down home scenes out of his imagination . Since that year he has stayed in Mississippi and Louisiana and painted what he knows . <P> Since he finished Swing Low , Sweet Chariot a year ago , slight , clear-headed Artist McCrady has been unaffected by the disposition of everyone who has seen it to make it the McCrady trademark . He has continued to do beautifully colored and dramatic canvases of small Southern towns and cotton country , is now at work on a picture called Judgment Day which will contain no less than 500 figures . An obviously gifted draughtsman , McCrady gets his luminous effects by " under-painting , " working in transparent color glazes on a warm , umber ground . Tender , fully imagined , though not profound , his Negro paintings appear as authentically melodious as the Kansas paintings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the Rehn Gallery , Chicagoan Aaron Bohrod , 29 , showed new and better work than the half-comic paintings of sleazy Chicago scenes by which he is known . Pontificated New York Times Critic Edward Alden Jewell : " Between the minor if vaguely haunting tightness of those minutiae and the ripe , fluent graciousness of the present work , a vast difference publishes itself . " Still this side of graciousness but studied with uncommon depth were Aaron Bohrod 's new subjects : poor whites , exhausted interiors of tourist cabins , a trailer camp , a sidewalk in New Orleans . <P> Twelve . At the Downtown Gallery , twelve ambitious young U. S. painters were represented by their best work of the year . From Boston , where he was born in 1915 , Jack Levine sent the most powerful canvas in the show , a Street Scene with three dreamlike , prodigious figures . As elegant as this was rough , The Various Spring by O. Louis Guglielmi , 31-year-old New Yorker , showed three identical blue-shirted workmen climbing maypoles to reach gift platters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
