SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL-Rearden Conner-Morrow ( $2.50 ) . <P> When Irishmen speak of the two years of murder , massacre , ambush and reprisal that marked Ireland 's last and most successful rebellion ( 1919-21 ) , they call it , with resigned racial euphemism , " the trouble . " Author Conner 's novel , without attempting to give a clear picture of what the various troublemakers were after , makes it quite clear that the trouble itself was desperate , often hellish . Shake Hands with the Devil reads like crude melodrama but Author Conner swears his tale is founded on brutal fact , has needed no embellishment . <P> Kerry Sutton was a half-English medical student in Dublin , a completely neutral spectator of the guerrilla warfare between the Black &; Tans and the Irish Republican Army . But he had the bad luck to witness the bombing of a Black &; Tan lorry , and in the subsequent shindy he shot a man in self-defense . After that , the only safety for Kerry was in the I. R. A. After being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ardfalla , a little village on the coast where the I. R. A. had a gunrunning post , an underground ammunition factory . Then Kerry began to see death . His first ambush was not so bad . The massacre of Black &; Tans herded into a cell was worse . When he was a witness of the cold-blooded shooting of pretty Kitty Brady it was nearly too much . But when he was given the pleasant job of guarding beautiful Lady Moira , a hostage , Kerry took a new lease on life . <P> Kerry fell madly in love with Lady Moira , who reciprocated just enough to keep him hopeful . Then one day when Kerry was down at the village , orders came from headquarters and Lady Moira was taken out and shot . Kerry went hell-for-leather to the nearest Black &; Tan post , gave himself up , turned informer . He had the pleasure of seeing his oldtime pals butchered . Finally the Black &; Tans tied him up in the underground factory , set a time-bomb ticking .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
