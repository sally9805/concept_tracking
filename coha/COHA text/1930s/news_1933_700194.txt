txt RECOVERY PLAN PUZZLES . We Are Approaching the Matter From the Wrong End , It Is Held . To the Editor of The New York Times : I always have been and always propose to be a good citizen . Just now I am doing my best to support the NRA , although I confess that it puzzles me . I find that most others are also asking themselves why it is necessary , or even sensible , to raise the prices of necessities such as food , clothing , fuel , &c.,; until a majority of those now unemployed have obtained work ? Would it not be better for a factory that now employs 100 hands at 60 cents an hour on a nine-hour-day basis to keep its price scale the same and place its 100 hands on shorter schedule , making up the help shortage by employing those who are now out of work and have the wage scale for all that remain at 60 cents an hour ? In that way the factory would be able to turn out the same quantity of goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change had been effected . Of course , those now employed would be losing a part of their income , but they also would be assisting in finding employment for their less fortunate brothers . After a , majority of the unemployed had thus been provided with at least part-time work it would then be time enough to gradually push prices to higher levels . To make the increase while millions still were unable to buy even at the bottom prices does not seem sensible . Is it because I do not understand or are we being badly fooled ? WILLIAM S. MORTIMER . Boston , Mass. , Nov. 2 , 1933.
