txt After a prolonged executive session in which Thomas E. Dewey , special prosecutor , was reported to have threatened to quit if the budget he sought for his inquiry into rackets in New York County were reduced , the Board of Estimate in a brief open meeting yesterday appropriated $122,000 to finance the investigation from July 29 to the close of the year . In the open meeting the vote was unanimous and the only approach to opposition came when Borough President James J. Lyons of the Bronx denounced the inquiry as " an extravagant use of the people 's money . " However , he said that in deference to the recommendation of Mayor La Guardia he would vote for it . 1 Mr. Dewey , District Attorney William C. Dodge and Police Commissioner Valentine were all present at the executive session , which lasted for an hour and a half . They were questioned in detail , it was said , about the need for various items in the budget of $121,456 which Mr. Dewey had prepared and submitted through Mr. Dodge , his nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dewey left the Mayor 's office at 12:30 . It was later learned , however , that the youthful special prosecutor had declared that his budget was the minimum with which an effective investigation could be carried on and that he had said he would withdraw if I it were reduced . Mayor Minimizes Episode . Mayor La Guardia minimized what had happened at the executive session . In a statement issued from his office after the board meeting was over he said : " The responsibility being with the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , it is natural that the members wanted to be informed of the details , the nature of the work , and I the method of approach . " The official request came to the board only Tuesday , and the session and the information sought are the usual procedure when applications for additional appropriations are made . " Apparently well pleased with the way things had gone and desiring to belittle the opposition that had been reported within the board on Wednesday , the Mayor declared at the board meeting that neither of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Borough President Samuel Levy of Manhattan , had at any time objected to the appropriation . When the open meeting began Henry H. Klein , lawyer , of 261 Broadway , who unsuccessfully tried to block the appropriation by a court order , argued that the board lacked the legal power to make the appropriation . He warned that the members of the board would be liable personally for any money that was illegally expended . Borough President George U .. Harvey of Queens asked the Mayor whether the Corporation Counsel would defend the board members from such personal suits , saying that twice under the Walker administration he had been forced to defend himself . The Mayor promised him that under this administration the Corporation Counsel would act . Mr , Lyons pied to amend the resolution so that the entire cost of the proceedings would fall upon the Borough of Manhattan instead of on the entire city . Borough President Raymond V. Ingersoll of Brooklyn raised a point of order which was sustained by the Mayor . Goldsmith Scores Inquiry . Joseph Goldsmith , president of the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ne charged , was " just a 1937 political campaign to make Mr. Dewey district attorney , and nothing else . " The Mayor , with a faint smile , replied : " On that I am not informed . Perhaps the gentleman knows more about it than I do . " When he was reached on the rollcall , Mr. Lyons said that he wanted to read a statement to explain his position . He said that he had noticed newspaper headlines such as " Tammany Balks Budget " and that he supposed that this was considered good copy . " For the enlightenment of the gentlemen of the press , I desire to state that I am not a member of Tammany Hall , but a member of the Democratic organization of Bronx County , " he said . He quoted from a letter which Mr. Dewey sent to Mr. Dodge the statement " it has been widely rumored and publicly stated that these conditions could not exist without the protection , either passive or active , of the law enforcement officials . " " I therefore assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a super assistant district attorney with its burden on the overtaxed people , " Mr. Lyons continued . " All recall the cost of the Seabury investigation , and I direct attention to the fact that most of the self-sacrificing young men on the Seabury staff have since affixed themselves to the city pay , roll . " It seems to me that most of these investigations are used by ambitious young men as a vehicle to attach themselves to the public payroll . I predict that this young Mr. Dewey will select his staff completely from the Fusion ranks and that most of these dollar-ayear patriots will endeavor to become payroll patriots . " Tammany Hall is amateurish compared to these skillful Fusion job manipulators . The budget proposed is greater than the budget of the elected District Attorney of the Bronx , and all will agree that racketeers are not permitted to ply their trade in the Bronx . " I believe that this proposal is an extravagant use of the people 's money , although the administration was pledged to economy . " In view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the county of New York , wherein vice is reputed to exist , I am willing to be guided by his recommendation on this matter and for one time , although I do not agree with him , I will vote with him . I vote aye . " The Mayor and the other members of the board chuckled audibly at the closing paragraph of Mr. Lyons 's statement . After the rollcall had been completed , the Mayor changed his vote so that he could have an opportunity to make a statement . He said : " There has been some unfairness , and I want to state that the two members of the board who are members of Tammany Hall never objected either in executive or in open session . They took an intelligent interest and asked questions , but they were clearly within their rights . " Mr. Dewey was appointed by Mr. Dodge at the request of Governor Lehman , and I have - more confidence in Governor Lehman than in the gentleman who wrote the statement that the gentleman Mr. Lyons read . " Mr. Lyons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " remark and offered to show him that the statement was in his own handwriting , but the matter was dropped amid general laughter . After the meeting Mr. Klein announced that he would continue to seek an injunction in an effort to stop the inquiry , but would probably not have his application ready before next week .
