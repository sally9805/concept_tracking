GOING TO MARKET A STORY BY ALBERT HALPER T HE little nag stands between the old worn shafts and bows her small meek head . She stands there with her shaggy fetlocks quiet , her hooves firm against the pavement of the street , while her uncut tail swings smartly at the pesty flies . One-two . She whacks them hard . At the curb , all hot and bothered , stands the grocer 's little son , his eyes drilling holes into the lines of the small gray horse . " I 'm going to market , " he says aloud , " I 'm going along to-day , " and he sparkles as he speaks . Eight years old , well-knit and sturdy , he almost dances in his tracks . Behind him , inside the small grocery , his father and older brother scan the shelves to see what stock is running low . The older brother , sixteen , soft down on his cheeks , given over to occasional dreaming , calls off the items while his father writes them down on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil . " How long will you be gone ? " asks the wife who has to mind the store . Her husband grunts . He hitches up his pants , scowls at his pencil , and , from under heavy brows , says , " One hour , two hours -- well , let 's be going . " Father and son stalk out . " Hi , Dave , making eyes at Bubba again ? " says the older brother , teasing him . The small boy stares humbly , imploringly at his father . With a grunt , the stocky little grocer swings up on the seat , and his older son eases up after him . At the curb the small kid begins gulping . " You said you 'd . . . " and he starts to bawl . The older brother , on the seat now , grins . The father , picking up the reins , thinking about the stock marked down on the paper bag , mutters , " All right , get on behind , hurry up . " Dave climbs nimbly on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dry splintered boards of the floor of the little wagon . His father looks behind , sees the boy is all right , then jerks at the reins . The small wagon swings to the right , the wheels head for the steel car tracks , wed themselves silently to the rails , and the nag jogs on , her hooves ringing dully against the stone cobbles between the tracks . The cart goes eastward on Lake Street , passing underneath the gloomy Elevated structure . From above , the morning sunshine pours itself through the spaced ties in blocks of harsh light . The rails narrow far ahead . The grocer , thinking about competition from chain-stores , hoping that none of them will find a vacancy and move into the block where his own store is , slaps the reins against the nag 's rump , and for a few yards she perks up , then jogs along at the same old pace again . Milt , the older brother , swinging a long leg idly , caresses the down on his cheek and wonders if he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a sharp tug at one rein , and the nag swings to the right , heading for the big Randolph Street market . Backed up along the curbings of the side streets , are trucks and wagons , and the sidewalks are piled high with all kinds of crated merchandise , also fruits and vegetables . Dave , his little legs going hard , his eyes alive , takes in everything , sniffing at the smoked meats of the wholesalers , wrinkling up his nose at the strong smell of fish . There are hollows in the street , and the wagon rocks and sways like a seining smack . Dave grips the back of the scat more firmly and holds on . On Randolph Street , near Halsted , the grocer spies an empty place , shouts at the nag suddenly and hacks in , jerking hard at the reins . Terrified , the little mare rears her fore hooves , prances like a racehorse , then goes quiet . Her mouth bleeds slightly near the bit . Pretty soon the cart is fitted in snugly , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son and the grocer swing down from the wagon and with , " You mind the wagon till we come back , " the eight-year-old boy is left alone . Watching his father and brother pick their way through the jammed sidewalk , around crates of plums , grapes , melons , asparagus , and peaches straight from the heart of Michigan , a strange fright at being left alone in all this noise and confusion pounds at his little heart , and he feels like screaming at them to take him along , when he suddenly remembers that this is his first trip , and if he pesters them they will not take him again . His face grows calm , but his heart continues to hammer a bit . As far as the eye can see is the bustling market . The street is widehere , about a hundred and fifty feet from curb to curb . in the center , where no traffic flows , stand the big trucks and wagons of the prairie farmers , and some of the loads have tarpaulins covering them . An Ogden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave , silent on the seat , looked up and down , growing calmer . Wagons backed in and drove off after loading and unloading , arguments sprang up on the sidewalk concerning prices and the weight , while on all sides truckers wheeling loads in and out of the wholesalers swore at one another for the right of way . The truckers were big fellows with caps snug against their skulls , but some of them , seeing Dave alone on the seat , had time to shout , " Hello , kid , how 's the weather up there on the wagon ? " Dave grinned weakly and started squirming on the seat , hoping his father and older brother would return pretty soon . A hot breeze , blowing up the street , brought the thick , sweetish smell of grapes toward him and , looking to the left , he saw , under a wide awning , a great load of crated California blue grapes packed so full the boards of the boxes bulged . Three truckers , two of them white , the third a negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crates inside the store . The three men worked in silence . On the wide sidewalk the crates stood stacked in a great square pile ten feet high , and ever so often a fat little boss came out , gripping a fistful of bills and shipping tickets , frowning up and down the street as if searching for something , but in reality he had come out to see if the boys were stalling , if they were working fast enough . Pretty soon he did not come out any more . Sitting high on the wagon seat , Dave saw that the two white truckers helped each other with their loading , while the colored man had to reach up at the pile and load his own truck alone , holding the handle of the truck firmly between his knees as he reached up with his arms . When the boss did not come out again Dave noticed also that every once in a while one of the white fellows , coming out of the store , would maliciously roll the small iron wheels of his hand-truck near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's shoes . The negro , his face heavy and thoughtful , worked in silence , glancing submissively down at the sidewalk . Trouble had been brewing between himself and the two white truckers for over a week now , but of course Dave knew nothing about that . Later on , when the wheels of one of the white truckers came too close , rolling over the entire left toe , the negro gave an ugly murmur , and his grip tightened upon the handles of his own truck ; he still stared down at the sidewalk as he shoved a load inside the dark , shady store , but submission did not show on his face . The two whites , rolling their loads after him , grinned toward the boy on the wagon seat and , when they stared at the nigger , went . " Haw , haw , haw . " The colored man came outside a minute later with his empty truck , his face still heavy but sullenly thoughtful and looked up the bustling street . He looked toward the east . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cop on horseback was trying to settle an argument with a wholesaler who claimed the farmer who had just sold him a load of berries had cheated on the deal . A small crowd gathered . The negro , tall and broad and calm now , stood watching . Up the street the cop sat his mount solidly , as if in the saddle of a motorcycle , and scratched his jaw . The wholesaler pulled out a pencil , started scribbling and quoted facts and figures to prove his point , while the farmer , a lean tall man in faded overalls , unshaven , hollow-eyed , stood by grim and silent . The cop shifted on the saddle . More people gathered . Dave sat on the wagon and his eyes were glued on the commotion at the corner . Pretty soon the two white truckers , coining from the store and seeing the negro standing quiet , yelled at the fellow to get going , to get a move on . " Come on , you big black bastard , we 're not doing your work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by quickly . The nigger drew his toes in just in time , his nostrils dilating until the swelling holes of his nose resembled the dark threatening bores of a double-barreled shot-gun . In silence all three loaded up and rolled another haul of crates inside . Dave , who took turns watching the argument up the street and the two whites against the nigger , started feeling nervous and longed for his father and older brother to come back . He told himself he 'd never come to market again . The bustle and the brutality of it , the jam of wagons , trucks , and yelling hustlers struck him like an ice-cold wave of lake water , and he shivered inwardly . He sat there with his little body growing hard and firm as he saw the three truckers coming from the store again , the two whites following the negro , hard on the negro 's heels as if grimly trailing the fellow . Up the street the argument at the corner was growing in heat and , torn between the two , Dave gripped the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began hammering hard against his ribs . By this time the sidewalk up and down the block was dead empty ; wholesalers and truckers had gone toward the corner where the argument was rising to an intense and bitter pitch . At the side of the cop 's horse the farmer , against them all , said nothing . occasionally feeling his rear overall pocket . He had been paid off already for the load and he meant to keep the money . The cop on horseback , scanning the scribbled figures of the wholesaler , scratched his jaw again . Then Dave , looking back at the two whites and the nigger , who went on working without paying any attention to the squabble at the corner , sat more rigid than ever . He saw one of the truckers dart next door , behind the nigger 's back , and snatch up a , long knife from the counter there . The store was a wholesale cheese company , and the long knife was used for halving the big thirty-and forty-pound cheeses . The trucker slipped the knife into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the nigger , straining , was toward them . The rest happened so quickly that the boy on the seat was confused by the action of it . Just as the nigger was passing under the shade of the awning the two white truckers looked quickly at each other , then one sprang forward at the nigger 's back ; the knife-flash that followed was dull because of the shade under the awning . But Dave heard the groan and the sob , saw the big negro fall softly , heavily forward . One of the truckers started whistling suddenly and went quickly out upon the sidewalk to see if the argument up the street was still in progress . He came back and nodded to his partner . Both were a trifle pale about the mouth now . Under the shade of the awning , stretched out to his full length , the negro lay quiet . He lay face down against the sidewalk , his nose flattened against the gray cement . Wiping the blade neatly and thoroughly against the fallen man 's hack , the trucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door , placed the knife on the counter , and then came back . Both truckers started whistling a quick tune , flatly . On the wagon-seat the small boy , his eyes popping from his head , was breathing hoarsely . He was conscious that the argument up the street was still going strong , but his eyes were glued on the negro 's broad quiet back , on a blotch of red which was spreading slowly , staining the center of the man 's shirt . The two truckers , still whistling , loaded up again and rolled eight crates apiece inside the store . The doorway was very wide , with a two-inch stair in front of it , and they had to grunt a bit as they forced the wheels over the obstacle . When they came out again for another haul they looked sharply up and down the street ; one broke open a crate , pulled out a bunch of grapes and , bending down , jammed the bunch against the nigger 's back . The grapes , bursting , spurted red juice all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , so that his face stared at the sky , and one of them took another bunch of grapes from the opened crate and placed it right under the nigger 's hack . They laid the crate nearby on the sidewalk . Then they folded the fellow 's hands on his chest . propped the limp head upon the low stair near the doorway , as if he were asleep , and loaded up again , whistling briskly . All this in broad daylight . All this while a cop was sitting his mount a hundred feet away , settling a business tangle . Dave started shivering . He looked at the calm brown face of the prone negro . The big fellow , stretched out , appeared to be sleeping . But the broad chest did not rise and fall . At the next load the two truckers , coming from the shady darkness of the store , strode to the corner to listen to the wrangle there , and remained in the crowd until a settlement was reached . In the end , his face sagging , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cop felt relieved , the wholesaler started looking genial , and the small crowd broke . Once more the sidewalk was alive . Then someone saw the nigger on the sidewalk  --  sleeping when there was such a big load yet to be taken inside the store . All at once laughter rippled the street , a release from the harsh tension of the squabble just settled . Someone nudged the prone figure with the tip of his hoot . No response . In a big half-circle wholesalers and truckers stood about chuckling and joking . " Niggers , they can sleep if hell is freezing . " " I always said a coon was lazy . " " Just look how nice and peaceful he snoozes , just look . " At the corner up the street the two truckers detailed with the negro to haul in the crated grapes were talking genially to the cop on horseback about the wrangle , getting the lowdown on the deal . " So the hick had to give Kuntz twenty dollars back , so he had to hand it over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big yellow teeth were bared in a grin at the cop . The cop grinned back , clucked his tongue at his horse , and started going up the street . The truckers stood awhile , pale around the mouth , not looking at each other . Then they went back to the job . The semicircle was still there . The two started working , breaking through the crowd , loading seriously , frowning , as if making up for lost time while watching the argument at the corner . Then someone bent down . " He 's not sleeping . " The crowd went quiet . They rolled him over . On the sidewalk was the red mashy juice of grapes , with slimy seeds sticking to the pavement . They felt his pulse , someone bent down to listen at his chest for heartbeats . " Call a doctor ! " The cry shot up the bustling street . " Why , he ai n't sleeping , he 's dead ! " The crowd pressed forward , milling , curious . Down the street the cop on horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunched together and , thinking another argument was springing up , jerked at the reins and galloped up to the scene . Many voices broke through toward him , all at the same time . " Look , he must have tripped over that opened crate and killed himself . He fell right on the box ; you can see the grapes sticking to his shirt . " Then someone , a little more curious than the others , felt around exploringly until his fingers came in contact with a clean slit in the shirt ; and on his palm , as he drew his hand away , was a sticky liquid darker than the juice from grapes . " He 's been knifed ! " The cop gat off the saddle and took charge of the situation . He rolled the nigger over again . " It may have been a nail from the box , " he said . All of them stared down at the calm-faced dead nigger . Then the cop , raising his head , turning it sharply like a proud horse , looked about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wagon seat , " did you see anything happen around here ? " The two truckers started whistling their tune louder than ever and turned their stares toward the kid on the wagon , frowning , boring him with their gaze , beetling their brows . Dave started bawling . " He 's only a kid , he do n't know anything , " someone said . The truckers whistled softly . Five minutes later the police ambulance arrived and the body was carried away . The crowd broke again , and after a haul one of the truckers went inside for a bucket of water and sloshed it against the sidewalk ; the wet pavement , giving off a thin purplish tint , glared and glittered in the sun . A boss came out , irritated , and waved his fistful of shipping tickets at the two truckers , bawling them out , telling them he was a man short now . " Snap out of it , " he said savagely and went inside again . The truckers , silent , not looking at each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them almost slipped on the purplish wet of the sidewalk , and the other sprang forward to catch him . They stood there clutching each other so tightly that it looked as if they did so to keep themselves from shivering . Five minutes later , when the grocer and his older son returned , they found Dave unnerved and whimpering , nervously biting his nails . The stocky little grocer , getting on the wagon , attacked his son with questions , wanted to know what was wrong , what was the matter ; but the boy only bawled the harder . At the curb the two truckers , whirling around , wet their lips and whistled toward the wagon seat , frowning and drilling with their stares . The grocer jerked at the reins . He had done all his ordering and now was going from wholesaler to wholesaler , to pick up the goods . As the wagon swung out from the parked trucks he turned impatiently on the boy and once more demanded to know what was the matter . " I saw  --  you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his little fist into his eye . " You left me all alone . " " Oh , is that all ? " grunted the grocer and guided the horse toward the first stop . " But you had Bubba with you , " teased the older brother , swinging his leg , stroking his downy cheeks . Dave started bawling harder than ever . The grocer could n't understand it . At the last stop in a side street they took on three crates of California grapes . When the boxes were on the wagon the older brother , digging with his fingers , pried a few grapes loose between the thin slats of the crate and offered some to Dave , the red juice of the first berries on his lips . Dave saw the stain on his older brother 's face and suddenly began screaming . The nag , jogging along , picked up her ears . " You keep quiet ! " the grocer shouted to the boy . " Keep quiet or I 'll box your ears ! This is the last time you come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed west , going under the Elevated . On its back flickered slabs of sunshine , and also on the sagging leather lines . " You ought to be ashamed , " mumbled the grocer , patting the boy 's head , one hand holding the reins . Dave swallowed hard and gulped down the sobbing , and as the cart rolled back toward the store he felt the summer wind rushing toward his face . and with his fingers he felt his tearstained , sticky cheeks . " You were gone so long , " he said again , this time softly . " I had to sit there all by myself . " Then , craning his neck over the side of the seat , he watched the twinkling hooves of the little nag hammering the cobbles between the Lake Street car tracks .
