It is estimated that if all the streams of the United States could have been concentrated on the Isthmus of Panama they would , in 73 days , have dug the canal , which required ten years to complete with the most powerful machines devised by man . The Po River in northern Italy is removing rock waste at a rate that is equal to lowering the entire surface of its basin one foot every 729 years . The rivers of the world carry a greater weight of sediment to the sea every year than the weight of all the freight carried by all the railroads in the same length of time . Material Carried in Solution . Besides the visible load which rivers carry in suspension , they also carry an invisible load of dissolved material taken from the soil and rocks through which the water has passed ; most of the common salt and lime carbonate in the ocean was carried there in this way . Even so small a body of water as Great Salt Lake in Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 85 years at the present rate of consumption . It has been estimated that streams annually carry 100 tons of dissolved matter on an average for every square mile of land surface of the earth , or about 5,000,000,000 tons 3,000,000 train loads . Floods . There could be no rich alluvial plains without floods , but these floods are often disastrous . The flood in Ohio in March , 1913 , which did such damage to the city of Dayton , destroyed about $200,000,000 worth of property . The Johnstown , flood in Pennsylvania ( 1889 ) drowned over 2000 people . The Hwang , or Yellow , River is known as " China 's Sorrow " because of the appalling loss of life due to its frequent floods . Its flood plain is one of the most densely populated regions of the world , and time after time from half a million to a million people have lost their lives by the river 's overflow . The frequent and devastating floods of the lower Mississippi are matters of national concern , and their control offers one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It necessarily follows that , since rivers erode the land and transport the waste , they must deposit // it somewhere . Wherever the velocity of a stream is checked , its transporting power is reduced , and sediment is likely to be deposited . Sand bars are built on the inner side of the curves of a river or along level stretches , or wherever the velocity of the stream is checked . Flood Plains . ? When streams overflow their banks and inun date the bordering lowlands , they deposit a layer of silt or sand and gradually build up the flood plains or alluvial plains which border many rivers , especially in their lower courses . Many of the richest agricultural valleys in the world are the flood plains of great rivers like the Nile , the Ganges , and the Yangtze , which were the seats of great nations and high civilizations as far back as history reaches . // Deltas . ? Some rivers , but not all , enter the sea or lakes under such conditions that their sediments are deposited at the mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Lawrence , flow through lakes in which they deposit most of their load and so have little material with which to build deltas ; the mouths of other rivers are so swept by tides and currents that deltas do not form . The delta of the Nile is a triangle 120 miles on each side and is intensively cultivated ( Fig. 125 ) . A large part of Holland is the delta of the Rhine ( Fig. 115 ) . The head of the ancient delta of the Mississippi is at Cairo , Ill. , 600 miles from the present mouth . The delta of the Hwang River in China is more than G00 miles broad , and is the home of many millions of people . The rich valley of the Po , in northern Italy , is built of delta and flood-plain deposits . The Rhone is advancing its delta into the Mediterranean at the rate of a mile a century . Alluvial Fans . At the mouths of mountain valleys , especially in arid lands , rivers , fed by mountain rains and snows , plunge // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the base of the mountains their speed is checked ; they flow some distance out into the plain or desert , then gradually sink into the sand , and the rock waste which they deposit builds alluvial fans ( Fig. 88 ) , often many square miles in extent . Sometimes the various fans spread out until they unite and form a nearly continuous slope extending for miles along the base of a mountain range . Filled Valleys . ? In this way valleys be-come partially filled and are known as filled valleys . The Great Valley of Cali fornia , extending nearly the length of the state , and the Ganges Valley of India are of this type ( Fig. 89 ) . River Terraces . ? Sometimes a river which has partially filled its valley with alluvial deposits has its supply of sediment greatly reduced , and it proceeds to erode a channel in this alluvial filling . As the river cuts its new channel downward , it changes its course more or less , leaving along the sides of the valley portions of the alluvial filling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers which carried away the waters of the melting ice at the close of the Glacial Period ; for example , the Connecticut , Delaware , Susquehanna , Ohio , Mississippi , and Missouri . // Drowned River Mouths . Portions of the continents are frequently rising or sinking ? very , very slowly , of course . When the land along the coast sinks , the mouths of the rivers are drowned and the sea backs up into the valleys ; thus V-shaped bays , widening in the direction of the sea , are formed . Such broad-mouthed rivers are called estuaries ( Figs. 225 , 226 ) . The drowning of the coast deepens these river mouths , and natural harbors are formed , as at New York , London , and Philadelphia . The eastern coast of North America , the coast of northwestern Europe , and many other coasts are of this type . SUMMARY Streams are nature 's means of carrying away the surplus rainfall . Their own motion and the rock waste which they carry , roll , and drag along enable rivers slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carve the valleys in which they flow . Weathering aids river erosion both by weakening the rocks and by supplying rock waste which the river uses as eroding tools . Rivers and valleys have their youth , maturity , and old age . In youth the streams have few tributaries and usually flow in ungraded courses and steep-sided valleys . With increasing time more tributaries develop , rapids and falls disappear , divides are eaten away , and valleys broaden out . Rapids and falls belong to young streams ; they are most commonly due to harder or more resistant rocks in the stream channels . A very resistant layer , like the limestone at Niagara , underlain by softer rocks , produces the cataract type of fall . By the working back of the crest , the fall slowly moves upstream , leaving a gorge below the fall , as at Niagara . A powerful stream working for a long time in a high plateau will carve a very deep canon ; the Grand Canon of the Colorado in Arizona , nearly a mile deep , is a striking example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry material in suspension and in solution . A big , swift stream can move rocks // weighing many hundreds of pounds ; and a great river like the Mississippi carries to the sea hundreds of millions of tons of silt each year . River deposits take the form of sand bars , flood plains , deltas , and , in special cases , alluvial fans . When a coast sinks , the mouths of the rivers are drowned , and harbors are produced . // CHAPTER VIII HISTORIC AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF AMERICAN RIVERS ' IMPORTANCE OF RIVERS IN OUR EARLY HISTORY Rivers the Gateways of the Continent . ? When Europeans first came to America they found dense and almost pathless forests . The tangled , thorny undergrowth , the fallen trees with their upturned roots and splintered limbs , the treacherous bogs and swamps combined to make exploration of the continent by land a nearly hopeless task . In that exploration the rivers played a part the importance of which we can now only vaguely appre ciate . The St. Lawrence , the Hudson , the Delaware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the explorers and colonists inland . The French penetrated 1500 miles into North America by way of the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes before New York or Philadelphia was founded . Dutch settlements early lined the shores of the Hudson and the Mohawk ; English set tlements extended up the Connecticut and the Delaware , and less than twenty years after the founding of Jamestown , plan tations spread along the James for more than a hundred miles . Yet a short distance back from the rivers the land remained almost untouched . Early Difficulties of Transportation in the United States . ? In this age we have no realization of the part which rivers played in the life of the American people up to the Railroad Era ( about 1840 ) . Roads for vehicles existed in but few localities before the Revolution , and for many years afterwards . Even between im portant cities , the stage roads were frequently almost impassable. 127 // An account published in 1797 says : " The roads from Philadelphia to Baltimore exhibit , for the greater part of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of six , eight , or ten feet occur at numerous intervals . A stagecoach which left Philadelphia on Feb. 5 , 1796 , took five days to go to Baltimore " ( 90 miles ) . It is said that President John Adams and his wife , driving overland to Washington , D. C. , in 1800 , could not follow the road and lost their way in the woods between Baltimore and Washington . Thurlow Weed of New York tells of a stage trip , in 1824 , from Albany to the western part of New York ( about 300 miles ) requiring six days and seven nights . The roads were in such horrible condition that the horses could seldom trot , and passengers frequently had to get out and walk , and sometimes had to push the coach . Under such conditions the transporting of farm products , flour , lumber , wood , and heavy merchandise on land was so slow and expensive that it was nearly prohibitive . It cost on an average from twenty to thirty times as much to ship goods a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hundred dollars a ton from Albany to Buffalo , or from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh , was a common charge . Water transportation offered t he only remedy for such conditions . An apparently accurate record shows that during four months in the year 1827 there passed down the Susquehanna River past Harrisburg 1631 rafts ( mainly lumber and timber ) and 1370 arks or flatboats , carrying farm produce , whisky , coal , etc . It is estimated that 300 keel-bottomed boats also passed during the same period . This would make 3300 boats and rafts passing one city in four months . Rivers and the Fur Trade . ? When the white man came to America its northern forests and streams abounded in fur-bearing animals . The furs brought high prices in Europe , and the profits of the fur trade led thousands of hunters to penetrate the forests , where , for the most part , they followed the rivers and lakes . The Indian canoe and the French batteau were almost the sole mode of travel . Says Professor Turner : " So powerful was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adventurous , lawless , fascinating fur trade ' that the scanty population of Canada was irresistibly drawn . . . into the interminable recesses of the continent . " To this day there is a vast region in Canada the domain of the Hudson 's Bay Company ? where the rivers are almost the only routes of travel , and the canoe practically the only conveyance . Rivers and Colonial Agriculture . ? Not only does the flood plain of a river furnish rich soil , but in the early days the river itself frequently furnished the only means of marketing the products of the soil . Nearly all the Virginia planters had their // own wharves on the rivers , from which they shipped their tobacco and other products directly to Europe , or by way of the smaller streams to convenient exporting points on the main rivers . The prosperity of the southern tidewater plantations was largely dependent upon the numerous rivers of the region . Throughout the colonies agriculture prospered only when carried on within easy reach of navigable waters . Rivers and Early Manufacturing . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing in small mills and factories , streams became important for power . The New Eng-land rivers are short and rapid ; in fact , most of the Atlantic coast rivers are rapid in some part of their courses . At rapids and falls , sawmills , flour and feed mills , iron forges and furnaces , and later , small cotton and woolen mills , sprang up ( Fig. 91 ) . Even as late as 1870 , 72 per cent of the manufacturing of New England was done by water power . // THE HISTORIC AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE ST . LAWRENCE RIVER SYSTEM Early History . ? The St. Lawrence with its chain of lakes has become one of the most important inland waterways of the world . It early led the French into the very heart of North America at the time when the English were pushing but a little way up the short rivers of the Atlantic slope . Explorations of the St. Lawrence and upper Mississippi gave the French kings their claim to the larger part of North America . The control of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried with it the control of a domain half as large as all Europe . Five tunes in five wars has this stronghold been besieged , and the nation which held Quebec and the St. Lawrence has always held Canada . Importance to Canadian Commerce . ? Montreal , at the head of ocean navigation on the St. Lawrence , is over 500 miles inland , // and is Canada 's greatest city and seaport . During seven months of the year a major part of the foreign commerce of Canada uses the St. Lawrence River and valley . Steamers drawing 12 feet of water may pass from Duluth , at the head of Lake Superior , to the Atlantic Ocean , a distance of 2000 miles . However , canals around rapids and falls are required ; there are two American canals and a Canadian canal at Sault Sainte Marie ; the Welland Canal i between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario provides a way around Niagara Falls ; and there are six short canals which make naviga132 HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY tion possible around the various rapids of the St. Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Canada live along this waterway or within two hours ' ride of it , and 80 per cent of their manufacturing industries are carried on in the same area . Physical Features of the River . ? In the stretch between Lake Ontario and Quebec the river is from a half mile to a mile wide , but beyond Quebec it opens gradually into a broad estuary and then merges into the Gulf of St. Lawrence . By means of soundings , the old river channel , now deeply submerged by the drowning of the valley , may be traced out to the edge of the continental shelf beyond Newfoundland ( Fig. 226 ) . The river is ahnost free from sediment and is unusually uniform in its flow because of the five Great Lakes in its course . Though it drains an area only onethird as great as does the Mississippi , it carries more water to the sea . The Ottawa River is the only large tributary . Water power is developed at the Soo ( Sault Sainte Marie ) , at points on the St. Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE MISSISSIPPI ? FATHER OF WATERS The lower Mississippi , discovered by the Spanish explorer Ferdinand de Soto in 1541 ( perhaps by Alonso de Pineda in 1519 ) . The upper Mississippi , discovered and explored by Father Marquette in 1673 ( perhaps by the Frenchmen Radisson and Groseilliers in or about 1665 ) . Length of the Mississippi proper , 2429 miles . Length from the source of the Missouri to the Gulf , 4200 miles . Depth at low water , St. Paul to St. Louis , 4 feet . Depth at low water , St. Louis to New Orleans , 8 to 9 feet . Navigable depth , New Orleans to Gulf , 30 feet or more . Average width between La Crosse , Wis. , and St. Louis , about 1 mile . Average width between St. Louis and the mouth of the river , 2 to 12 miles . Average slope of the river from St. Paul to Cairo , 6 inches to the mile . Average slope of the river from Cairo to the Gulf , 3 inches to the mile . Average slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -A inch to the mile . Falls and Rapids : Above Minneapolis , numerous falls and rapids . At Minneapolis , ? rapids and falls of St. Anthony , total fall of 78 feet . Near Rock Island , Ill. , and Davenport , Iowa , rapids , 20 feet fall in 16 miles . At Keokuk , Iowa , rapids , 23 feet fall in 12 miles . // The Upper Mississippi . ? Most great rivers have their headwaters in mountains , but the Mississippi begins on a plain in a maze of swamps and lakes . From the head of navigation at Minneapolis to the mouth of the Ohio , the river flows through an ancient rock chan-nel filled to a depth of 150 to 200 feet by the river 's own de-posits ( Fig. 94 ) . The ancient channel is in most places several times as wide as the present river and its rocky bluff 's rise from 100 to 650 feet above the level of the river . It is a region of rare beauty , scarcely in-ferior to the High-lands of the Hudson or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless islands , among which the river threads its way , and the main channel is sometimes hard to determine ( Fig. 95 ) . At low water , boats drawing four feet have some difficulty in navigating . The Lower Mississippi . ? South of the junction with the Ohio the Mississippi changes greatly . As you go down the river the rock bluffs are farther and farther apart , and the alluvial plain , widening southward , blends with the low coastal plain . Cairo marks the head of the original delta of the Mississippi . Over the flood plain , from 20 to 70 miles in width , the sluggish river meanders in great oxbow curves . From time to time the river cuts through the narrow neck of some of these bends and then abandons the long curve , which becomes one of the many oxbow lakes that border the river ( Fig. 96 ) . // The Natural Levees . = The Missouri brings to the Missis sippi an enormous amount of silt , making the water yellow . So slight is the grade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits sand bars at frequent intervals . For ages past , at flood stages , the river has overflowed its banks and covered its flood plain , slowly building it up by the sediments which it deposited . More sedi-ment was deposited near the river than at a distance , and this caused the building up of low embankments , called nat ural levees , on either side of the river ( Fig. 97 ) . Since these are a little higher and drier than land some distance back from the river , the levees are selected as sites for plantations and towns and for the roadbeds of railroads . New Orleans is built on such a natural levee . The Problem of Controlling the River . So great is the area of land whose waters drain into the Mississippi and so large is the annual rainfall that times the river is forced to at carry an enormous volume of water . The Ohio is the greatest contributor . Nearly every spring the flood waters rise to a dangerous height , overflowing the banks , breaking through the levees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levees or ( likes of earth have been built . They are partially , but not wholly , successful ; floods still break through the dikes and a serious loss of life and property sometimes follows . The national government and the states most interested are struggling with the problem which // will be partially , if not wholly , solved by completing the line of dikes and building them higher and stronger . PRINCIPAL TRIBUTARIES OF THE MISSISSIPPI The Ohio ( 967 miles long ) is less than half as long as the Missouri ( 2400 miles ) , and its drainage basin has less than one half the area ; yet it pours twice as much water into the Mississippi . This is due both to the heavier rainfall and to the smaller evaporation and less seepage into the soil . The Ohio has been one of our most important rivers . It has been designated by Congress as the first river to be extensively improved for navigation ; 50 locks and movable dams have been constructed in an effort to secure a 9-foot channel the entire length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Missouri heads in the Continental Divide in Montana , and is longer than any European river ; it is one of the muddiest of streams , carrying more than 100,000,000 tons of silt annually . In the region of Great Falls , Mont. , it takes five successive plunges , 612 feet in all , thus yielding great water power . At times of high water it was somewhat used for navigation until its territory was traversed by railroads . At low water it is very shallow and is now scarcely used at all for navigation . The Arkansas and the Red rivers are long , shallow streams , entering the lower Mississippi from the west . Improvements for the benefit of navigation have been made by the government . but only a small amount of traffic is maintained . Where the Arkansas cuts its way through the eastern range of the Rocky Mountains , in Colorado , it has carved one of the most famous gorges of the West , the Royal Gorge of the Arkansas ; it is more than 2500 feet in depth with almost perpendicular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rockies ( Fig. 99 ) . THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE MISSISSIPPI AS A COMMERCIAL WATERWAY Three Periods . ? People who now live near the Mississippi River and see only the occasional passing of a steamboat can // scarcely picture to themselves the scenes on the river before the day of railroads . It is convenient to divide the history of the Mississippi River navigation into three periods : 1 . The period of the canoe and flatboat , extending to the decade between 1820 and 1830. 2 . The period of greatest steamboat traffic , ending between 1850 and 1860. 3 . The period of decline and possible recovery , 1860 to the present . The Period of the Canoe and Flatboat . ? From the days of the first fur traders until about 1800 , the Mississippi system formed a network of waterways traversed mainly by canoes . At several places in Wisconsin , Illinois , Indiana , and Ohio , the headwaters of streams flowing toward the Mississippi were near streams flowing to the Great Lakes . Before the white man came , the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to be called ( from the French word meaning " to carry " ) . The canoes were paddled as far as possible up one river or creek , carried across the portage to another flowing in the opposite direction , whence they proceeded down that stream . Waterways were almost the only highways , and the light canoe , which could be carried around falls and rapids or from one stream to another , was almost the only means of traveling or carrying goods in those early days . In 1803 the United States purchased the territory of Louisiana from France and thus secured control of practically the entire Mississippi basin . Even before this an ever increasing number of pioneer settlers had been pouring through the gaps and passes of the Appalachian Mountains into the West . They settled along the rivers , raised crops , and sought markets in which to sell them . But nearly all these streams led to rivers that flowed , not toward the east , but toward the Mississippi . Hence the surplus wheat , pork , flour , corn , furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Appalachians , found its easiest outlet to markets by going down the rivers to the Mississippi and to New Orleans , whence much of it was taken to cities on the Atlantic // seaboard to Europe , or elsewhere . It was a long , roundabout journey . During this period the flatboat became important . It was a crudely built affair , perhaps 15 feet wide by 40 feet long . It rose but little above the water , and its broad , flat bottom sank but little below the surface . It floated downstream , but had no means of returning against the current ; hence it was , as a rule , broken up and sold for wood or lumber at its destination , and its owners returned home as best they could . Before the coming of the steamboat , the flatboat was the principal means of moving heavy freight downstream . The upstream traffic was small and was mainly carried in keel boats and barges propelled by poles , oars , or sails , and sometimes towed by ropes . Second Period : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Ohio and Mississippi soon after 1810 , and their coming wrought a mighty change . Then up-stream traffic as well as better downstream traffic became pos sible . Railroads were yet unknown and good highways scarcely existed ; rivers were still all - important . Our western rivers prob ably will never again play such an important part in the life of // the nation as they played between 1820 and 1860 . The coming of the steamboat reduced a week 's journey to a day 's ; passenger and freight rates gradually fell to a quarter of their former level . Farming became profitable and settlers flocked into the West by thousands , particularly after the Erie Canal was opened in 1825 . New Orleans doubled in population between 1830 and 1840 . In 1834 there were 230 steamboats plying our western rivers , and by 1850 there were more than 1200 , carrying a commerce of over $500,000,000 a year . In the years between 1840 and 1850 , upwards of 2000 steamboats a year arrived at St. Louis and from 4000 to 5000 passed Cairo , Ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rivers carried the vast majority of the products of the West . In 1851 , 97% of the beef , 96% of the corn , and 97% of the flour sent from Cincinnati went down the Ohio by boat . The wharves of Pittsburgh , Cincin nati , Louisville , St. Louis , Memphis , and New Orleans were thronged with river craft . Writing of this period , Miss Ellen Semple says : " On the large , elegantly equipped passenger boats , which made regular winter trips between Cincinnati or St. Louis and New Orleans , gay social life with nightly balls gave to river travel on the Mississippi a local color such as it acquired nowhere else . Less than fifty years from the ripple of the fur-weighted pirogue . . . to the monotonous splash of the big paddle wheel and the floating palace with its lights , music , and the polished society of the generous Southland. " // Third Period : The Decline of River Navigation . ? The first railroads in the United States were built as early as 1830 . The first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island in 1854 . Others soon followed and made connections with routes to the eastern states where western produce was in demand . The Mississippi and its branches had performed a most valuable service , but they led by very long routes to eastern markets . The railroads , crude as they were in the beginning , were more rapid than boats and led either directly to the East or to water routes by way of the Great Lakes and Erie Canal . The Civil War seriously crippled traffic on the Mississippi and hastened the decline which had already begun . Year by year steamboat owners on the western rivers found their profits diminishing ; as boats became old , they were abandoned and were not replaced ; many were destroyed during the war . Steamboat arrivals at St. Louis numbered 3626 in 1853 and 2800 in 1870 . River shipments from this city amounted to 600,000 tons in 1890 , but to only 89,000 tons in 1906 , while shipments by rail from St. Louis rose from 5 million to 17 million tons in the same time . Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic declined to a very small fraction of its former magnitude . After the World War , the United States Government attempted to restore river traffic between New Orleans and St. Louis and , later , on the Upper Mississippi . Fleets of barges towed by tug boats are operating and a small but increasing amount of freight is being carried . Reasons for the Decline of River Navigation . ? 1 . The increased efficiency of railroads 2 . The decline in railroad freight rates from 1860 to 1900 3 . The effort of railroads to destroy river traffic 4 . The public demand for swifter and more certain service than rivers afforded 5 . The cost of keeping rivers dredged and otherwise improved to meet modern needs The waterways problem is one of the great questions before the American people . Shall we expend millions of dollars annually // in an effort to make and keep rivers navigable ? There are arguments on both sides . What our government 's policy in this particular should be is far from clear . The millions that we have been spending yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rivers vary enormously in volume , the Mississippi at Cairo sometimes rising 50 feet . They are constantly silting up their channels ; this is especially true of the Missouri and lower Mississippi . Our largest rivers do not flow in the direction required by the principal movements of trade . The government 's method of making river improvements is costly and unsystematic . Our past experience causes some people to doubt the wisdom of continuing a policy of river improvement that will call for hundreds of millions of dollars , but others believe such a policy to be desirable . THE GREAT LAKES AS A COMMERCIAL WATERWAY Character of the Waterway . ? The Great Lakes are the leading inland waterway of the country because : 1 . They are deep enough for boats of great size . 2 . They extend east and west , the direction of the heaviest freight movement . 3 . They are in a region that has a large population and supplies an enormous tonnage of iron ore , coal , and grain . 4 . They require comparatively little outlay for maintenance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they may be passed by the Welland Canal in Canada , which is being enlarged . This canal is much used by Canadian but little by American vessels ( Fig. 92 ) . So far as American traffic is concerned the Great Lakes waterway practically ends at Buffalo . The locks in the Welland Canal and in the St. Lawrence canals make passage slow , and the United States has no important port on Lake Ontario or the St. Lawrence . Between Lake Superior and Lake Huron are the St. Marys Falls or Rapids ( usually referred to as Sault Sainte Marie or " the Soo " ) . Around these are three canals , one belonging to Canada and two to the United States . // The chief drawback to this great waterway is the fact that it is closed by ice during the five cold months of each year . For many years the Erie Canal formed a very important connection between the Lakes and the Atlantic , but this waterway declined with the increased use of railroads . The enlarged Erie Canal , now properly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown itself to be an important waterway . Present Traffic on the Lakes . ? The wonderfully rich iron ores mined around Lake Superior supply over 60 per cent of the freight carried on the Lakes . Specially designed steel steamships of great size , 500 to 700 feet long and carrying as high as 15,000 tons of ore , ply between ports at the head of Lake Superior and cities on Lake Michigan and Lake Erie . The tonnage of freight passing through // the St. Marys canals rose from a little over a million tons in 1880 to 83 million tons in 1927 . The tonnage ( not value ) of freight which passes through the Detroit River in seven months is several times as great as that which passes through the Suez Canal in a year . The tonnage of the vessels on the Great Lakes is 20 times as great as that of the steamships nav igating all the rivers of the Mississippi sys tem . The freight rate on ore and coal carried on the Great Lakes is very low , sometimes as low as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big ore-carrying boats earn upwards of 81000 a day . They make the round trip between Duluth or Superior and Lake Erie ports in about a week . Importance to the Steel Industry . It happens that our greatest iron mines ( near Lake Superior ) are situated nearly a thousand miles from the mines which yield the best coal for making coke ( in western Pennsylvania ) . Before the iron ore can be smelted , the ore and coke must be brought together . The lake steamers carry a ton of coal or iron ore a thousand miles for less than the charge of hauling it a hundred miles by rail . Growth of Cities on the Mississippi and on the Great Lakes . ? The commercial decline of the Mississippi and the rise of the Great Lakes as a waterway are strikingly illustrated by the fact that while the six leading cities on the Ohio and Mississippi gained // about 325,000 population from 1910 to 1920 , the six leading cities on the Great Lakes waterway gained 1,620,000 in the same period . RIVERS AS SOURCES OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until electricity came into use , water power could be employed only at the actual place where it existed . Now it may be converted into an electric current and conveyed scores or even hundreds of miles . Most of the great water power plants installed in recent years are hydroelectric plants , or those which convert the water power into electricity . Such are the great power houses at Niagara Falls , at heokuk on the Mississippi ( Fig. 100 ) , at Great Falls , Mont. , and at various places in Colorado , Washington , California , the Southern Appalachians , and elsewhere . Many mills and factories , especially in the eastern states , are still situated close beside the rivers at points where the falls or rapids occur , and their machinery is driven directly by the revolving water wheels . New England 's early start in manufacturing was greatly aided by abundant water power , and many of her leading cities are located at water power sites . The banks of the Merrimac in southern New Hampshire and Massachusetts are dotted with mills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass. ( paper ) ; Paterson , N. J. ( silk ) ; Rochester , N. Y. ( flour ) ; Grand Rapids , Mich. ( furniture ) ; Minneapolis , Minn. ( flour ) ; and a long list of other places belong to the group of water-power cities . Development of Water Power in the South . The swift streams of the Southern Appalachians are being harnessed for manufacturing purposes , notably for the making of cotton goods . Along the east-flowing streams in North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia , and to a smaller extent on the western side of the Appalachians in Tennessee and Alabama , mills and factories have been built in large numbers . Sixty per cent of our cotton spindles are in this region . Water Power and the Manufacture of Paper . ? Most of our paper is made from wood pulp . A great amount of cheap power // is needed in this industry and so the chief paper-making centers are in the northern parts of New England , New York , Michigan , Wisconsin , and in Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods are found near together . WESTERN RIVERS Important Western Rivers . ? The Columbia and Snake rivers and their branches form the drainage system of our Pacific Northwest . Into the great lava plateau these rivers have cut canons from a thousand to two thousand feet in depth . By means of locks at two points the Columbia has been made navigable for 400 miles from its mouth . Ocean vessels ascend the Columbia and Willamette 110 miles to Portland . The salmon fisheries of the Columbia River , and the Colorado with its wonderful canon are described elsewhere . Portions of the Sacramento and of the San Joaquin in California , a short lower stretch of the Colo rado , and a long stretch of the upper Missouri are classed as // navigable rivers , but , with the exception of the Sacramento , they are little used . Character of the Western Rivers . ? Of the 26,000 miles of navigable rivers in the United States , only 2000 miles are in the western half of the country . There are seven western states that contain no navigable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainfall over these states is small , except along the coast north from San Francisco and on the higher mountains , most of which collect a good deal of snow . Many of the rivers flow long distances through arid regions and lose a considerable part of their water by seepage and evaporation , and in late summer they may dwindle to mere creeks . The Rio Grande , for example , in certain places almost disappears for miles , flowing in the gravel of its bed . After heavy rains in the mountains or when the snows are meltAMERICAN // ing , the mountain streams become torrents and sweep down their courses with terrific violence , carrying everything before them ; but at other times they may become almost dry . IRRIGATION The Growth of Irrigation in the United States . ? Irrigation is one of the oldest devices of civilized man ; it was practiced in ancient Egypt , India , Mesopotamia , China , and among certain tribes of American Indians . The first Americans to use irrigation in the West were the Mormons , who entered Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico . In the last half century its use has spread into hundreds of our western valleys . The progress from the first simple irrigation dams and canals of the early settlers to the great masonry dams and canals constructed by the United States Government makes a remarkable story . // Extent and Methods of Irrigation . ? In many of the western valleys the land is rich in plant food , and sunshine is abundant , but rainfall is inadequate . The larger part of the land of eleven western states can not grow crops without irrigation . In 1928 about 20 million acres , an area as large as South Carolina , were under irrigation . This exceeds the cultivated area of Massachusetts , Connecticut , Vermont , Rhode Island , New Jersey , and Delaware combined , yet it is less than 3 per cent of the dry lands of the Vest . Most of the irrigating is accomplished by building darns which hold the flood waters in reservoirs to be used during the dry summer . By means of main canals , branch canals , and ditches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 109 ) . In a few states , mainly in California , water from wells ( about 20,000 in all ) is used . // The great majority of the fifty or sixty thousand irrigation enterprises in the United States include only a few hundred acres each , but some of the private enterprises , and all of the United States Reclamation projects ( about 30 ) , include thousands of acres each , a few of them exceeding 200,000 acres ? equal to a small county . The less expensive projects have been established by individual farmers or groups of farmers or by irrigation companies , but large projects costing millions of dollars have been carried out by the government through the Reclamation Service ; yet a great deal more land is irrigated by private individuals and corporations than by the United States Government through the Reclamation Service . Irrigation Farming . ? Undoubtedly irrigation farming has many attractions . The farms or ranches are usually small and care-fully cultivated , and weather conditions are more dependable // than in a humid climate . The people who have settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually excellent . Orchards and vineyards of 10 or 20 acres , when suc cessfully managed , may yield their owners as much profit as 160-acre farms in the Middle West or East . While such instances are numerous , they show what is possible rather than what is common ; indeed , only about one twentieth of the irrigated land is devoted to fruit ; more than three fourths produce grain , hay , and alfalfa ; to the last-named crop nearly one third of all our irrigated land is devoted . The large United States Reclamation projects have been very expensive , and many of them are not financially successful . // CHAPTER IX SIX OF THE WORLD 'S GREAT RIVERS ' THE AMAZON AND BRAZIL Size . ? The Amazon is the monarch of rivers . Though not quite so long as the Mississippi-Missouri , its basin is much larger , and it pours into the ocean a much greater volume of water . Rising in the lofty Andes within a hundred miles of the Pacific , it flows in a course nearly 4000 miles long into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly in two . For almost its entire length the Amazon flows near the equator and parallel to it ; thus it is in a region where the rainfall is very heavy . Over the larger part of the basin the rainfall amounts to from 6 to 8 feet ( 72 to 96 inches ) per year , and much of the land is so low and flat that at times of flood vast areas are under water . The great river does not flow in a single channel , but is like a braid of many strands . There are so many islands and so many channels that the traveler almost never sees the whole width of the mighty river . Near its mouth it becomes a hundred miles wide , and from the middle neither bank can be seen . Important Features . The great size of its basin . The Amazon drains an area larger than that of all Europe outside of Russia . Its enormous volume of water . It pours more water into the Atlantic than all the rivers from Alaska to Cape Horn pour into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces its yellow waters 200 miles out into the ocean . 157 // 3 . Its exceedingly slight grade . On the eastern slope of the Andes the headwater streams make terrific plunges , but in the final 2000 miles of its course the Amazon falls only 35 feet , an average of two tenths of an inch to the mile . Contrast this with the St. Lawrence , which falls 250 feet in its lower course in a tenth of this distance . No other great river has such a gentle gradient . Its great depth . It is only by constant dredging of the Mississippi that a channel 9 feet deep is maintained between the mouth of the Ohio and New Orleans . The Amazon has an average depth of 100 feet or more for a greater distance than this , and from the mouth of the Rio Negro to the sea the river is about 200 feet deep . Ocean steamships ascend 2300 miles to Iquitos in Peru , and steamers drawing 14 feet of water may ascend 480 miles farther . No other large river of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 5 . The great number and size of its tributaries . Fourteen of these are as long as the Rhine or longer , and of much greater volume , and at least one is as long as the Mississippi . The Amazon Jungle . ? The larger portion of the Amazon basin is a vast , uncultivated , almost unpeopled wilderness . There are // great stretches of morass in which the dense tropical forest is woven together by a tangle of undergrowth and vines looping from tree to tree or hanging from every limb . The Amazon forests form one of the most impenetrable jungles found anywhere in the world , and if it were not for the rubber trees most of the wilderness would still be little known to the outside world ( Fig. 113 ) . Comparison of the Amazon and Mississippi Valleys . ? The Amazon basin is an impressive example of the way in which a bad climate may almost completely block the development of a region . Aside from climate and the consequences of climate , the basin of the Mississippi is not unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and progressive people , is dotted with cities , crisscrossed by railroads , and sprinkled with churches , schools , colleges , and libraries ; both its agricultural and manufactured products are measured in billions of dollars a year . The other has not a single large city ; r in most of its area there is not a mile of road or railroad , not a mill or factory , not a school or church , nor a cultivated farm or a white man 's permanent home . The state of Amazonas contains an average of only about one person to two square miles . In the four hundred years sine ( ' Europeans penetrated the Amazon Valley little progress has been made there , but the valley of the Mississippi , on the contrary , has had a phenomenal develop ment . What caused the difference ? The answer lies mainly in the single word , climate . This is an example of a geographical influence that is worth remembering . Just a difference in the angle of the sun 's rays and in the amount of rain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other is the home of mil-lions of progressive people and the heart of the world 's richest nation ! Navigation . ? The Amazon and its tributaries are much used for navigation . Practically all of the products of its basin , rubber , cabinet woods , Brazil nuts , and cacao , reach the outer world by way of the river , and all of the supplies are carried in by the same route . Regular lines of steamers ply up and down the // river and its chief tributaries . Ocean-going steamships load at Iquitos or Manaos , the chief cities of the interior , and proceed directly to ports of the United States and Europe . Smaller boats visit the rubber-collecting centers on the many rivers , and carry the rubber to Manaos or to Para ( Belem : population 275,000 ) at the mouth of the river ; moreover , a part of the products of Bolivia and Peru reach the outer world by way of the Amazon . The Madeira , one of the great tributaries , has a series of 13 falls and rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A peculiar condition exists at the headwaters of a branch of the Amazon and a branch of the Orinoco : the two rivers are united by a stream of considerable size ( the Casiquiare ) , and at high water small boats may pass from one of these great river systems to the other . THE RHINE AND GERMANY Importance to Germany . The Rhine is the most historic of European rivers . From the days of Julius Caesar down through the struggles of the Middle Ages to the present , the valley of the Rhine has been the scene of stirring events . It has been for more than a thousand years the principal link in the great north-south road across Europe , uniting the Mediterranean with the North Sea and the Baltic . More myths and songs and legends are associated with the Rhine than with any other part of the German Fatherland . The historic river is singularly woven into the affections and patriotism of the German people . Physical Features . ? Though only 800 miles in length , the Rhine rises in one country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third . Its headwaters are collected from lakes and glaciers of the Alps . Flowing through the beautiful Lake of Constance , it reaches the Swiss frontier at the city of Basel . Of the 233 miles in Switzerland very little is navigable even for small boats ( Fig. 114 ) . Between Basel and Bingen ( 224 miles ) the Rhine winds over a flood plain 20 miles in width . Through part of this distance the river forms the boundary between Germany and France . For // more than a hundred years , the cities and provinces along this section of the Rhine have been engaged in straightening the river , building embankments and walls to check its overflow , and narrowing it here and there to concentrate its current and prevent silting . By cutting across the necks of the great meanders , the river has been shortened 45 miles in this portion ( Fig. 116 ) . The navigation of this part of the river is mainly confined to the stretch below Mannheim . Between the cities of Bingen and Bonn the river traverses an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms the famous and romantic " Gorge of the Rhine . " Here the valley is narrow , and the valley walls rise steeply ; at nearly every curve a frowning height , topped by the ruins of an old castle , commands the river ( Fig. 118 ) . Many of the steep slopes are terraced for vineyards . Cities find room for growth only at places where a tributary stream joins the main stream , and railroads hug the river // on both sides , finding scarcely room enough for their tracks . Midway down the gorge the river Moselle comes in from France . Northward from Bonn the Rhine crosses the flat North German Plain , passes a succession of great industrial cities and enters Hol land , a large part of which is made up of the Rhine delta . Across Holland the river flows in a winding , sluggish course , and enters the sea through many mouths . The Rhine in the Middle Ages . In the Middle Ages there were two important groups of commercial cities one group in Italy , including Venice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Hanseatic League , the most important cities of which were near the shores of the Baltic and North seas . Between these two regions the easiest route was the valley of the Rhine , and along that river moved the most valuable overland trade of Europe . Scores of petty nobles had their little realms along the Rhine and its tributaries , and at every commanding Omt Some feudal baron built p his castle and levied " toll " on passing merchants and trav elers . These were the robber barons of the Rhine , whose ruined castles still overlook the river ( Fig. 118 ) . On an average , merchandise doubled in cost for every hundred // miles it proceeded along these toll-afflicted routes . Even as late as 1790 , there were 29 legalized toll stations between Strasbourg and the border of Holland ; and in the early part of the nineteenth century every laden boat that passed Cologne or Mainz had to unload its cargo and display it for sale in those cities . It was a long , bitter struggle that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Twentieth Century . ? After the union of the many German states into the German Empire , great sums of money were expended upon the Rhine . It was shortened by straightening curves ( Fig. 116 ) , rocky shoals and obstructions were blasted out , shallow portions were dredged , and nearly every city along the river built havens and docks equipped with modern loading and unload ing machinery . Below Cologne the navigable depth is nearly 10 // feet , between Cologne and St. Goar it is 8 feet , and from St. Goar to Mannheim it is 62 feet . Prior to the World War the Rhine fleet consisted of more than 10,000 steamboats and barges . Passenger steamers ply constantly from city to city . Steam tugs tow a train of three or four barges ( Fig. 120 ) , carrying from a few hundred tons to 3000 tons each . As would be expected , the commodities carried by water are mainly coal , iron ore , stone , cement , grain , and other heavy articles . The tonnage of freight carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cost is fairly low . The Rhine flows through one of the most densely populated and productive regions of Europe . There are no less than 20 important cities along the river or directly tributary to it ; great coal mines and iron mines are near by , and its mouths reach three world ports // ? Antwerp , Rotterdam , and Amsterdam . A network of canals connects the Rhine with the Seine in France , with the Danube , and with the Elbe and other German rivers . The fact that the mouth of the Rhine is controlled by a foreign power and that the great ports which serve the Rhine are in foreign territory is , of course , a disadvantage to Germany . The defeat of Germany in the great World War has changed her relations to the Rhine , which can scarcely be called a German river any longer . By the terms of the treaty of peace Germany is forbidden to build or maintain fortifications or to keep armed forces nearer than 50 kilometers ( about 31 miles ) from the east bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river even in her own territory , for it is placed in the hands of an international commission . // THE VOLGA AND RUSSIA Physical Features . ? The Volga is the longest river of Europe , as well as Russia 's most important waterway , but its volume is less than that of the Danube . It is 2300 miles long , equal to the distance from Boston to the Rocky Mountains , and navigable for 2000 miles . Russia is very poorly supplied with highways and railroads , and its rivers , like those of the United States at an earlier period , have been important avenues of transportation . Time does not count so much in Russia as it does in the United States , and slow-moving river craft are quite satisfactory . Unlike most large rivers , the Volga does not rise in mountains or flow even in sight of mountains . It begins in one of the greatest of the Russian swamps at the low elevation of 600 feet above sea level , flows in a crooked course through a vast plain , and empties into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has one notable peculiarity ? for a large part of its course , it cuts against the right bank , producing earth cliffs of considerable height , while the left bank is low and easily flooded . This gives rise to a peculiar distribution of cities and towns ; in the lower three fifths of its course there are only four important towns on the left bank ( east ) , but over thirty on the // right bank ( Fig. 122 ) . The river flows through an excellent farming region and from 30 to 40 million people live in its drainage basin . Canals connect the Volga with rivers flowing into the Baltic , the White , and the Black seas . Navigation of the Volga . ? Since the Caspian Sea is an inland lake in a nearly desert land , the traffic on the Volga is largely upstream . Fifteen times as much traffic formerly reached Leningrad ( Petrograd ) by the Volga canals as reached Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga . Russia has long been a country of fairs , and the greatest fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novgorod on the Volga in the very heart of Russia . Here , in late summer , gathered tens of thousands of buyers and sellers of almost everything ; traders came from every part of the Empire and of Europe ? from Persia , Turkey , and even from the bor ders of China . Goods to the value of about one hundred million dollars changed hands each season , and a large part of these came and went by the river . Thirteen thousand boats entered Nizhni Novgorod annually , and 2000 to 3000 entered and cleared at Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga . // The Volga as a waterway has two drawbacks its upper portion is icebound for five months , and its lower course for three months , while in a dry summer the water becomes so shallow that navigation is difficult and dredging is constantly necessary . At its mouth the Volga is building a great delta in which the river has some 150 shifting distributaries and 50 regular channels . In the lower Volga , great numbers of sturgeon are caught and from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and widely sold . The Volga is to be remembered as the most important river of Russia ? particularly important in the nation 's life because Russia has not passed the stage of development in which rivers are arteries of transportation . THE NILE AND EGYPT Historic Relations . ? The Greek historian Herodotus ( 450 B.C. ) called Egypt the gift of the Nile . About all of Egypt that produces crops is a narrow green ribbon from 1 to 10 miles wide , stretching a thousand miles across the brown and yellow desert , and ending in a fertile delta 150 miles broad . Thousands of years before civilized man lived in western Europe , the valley of the Nile was the seat of powerful and enlightened empires , where lived a remarkable race of builders , engineers , and warriors . Their temples and pyramids have been the wonder of all ages . The Nile Valley was the cradle of one of the world 's oldest civilizations . When we catch the first glimpse of the ancient Egyptians , 6000 years ago , they were even then far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second iii length only to the Mississippi-Missouri , is over 4000 miles long . Rising almost on the equator in one of the great lakes of central Africa ( Victoria Nyanza ) , fed by the heavy downpours of the belt of calms and of the Abyssinian monsoon , the Nile carries such a volume of water that it flows 1600 miles across the Sahara without increase from a single tributary . Three great rivers combine to make the Egyptian Nile ( Fig. 124 ) the White Nile from the equatorial lakes , and // the Blue Nile and the Atbara from the mountains of Abyssinia . In the middle course of the river are six series of rapids called cata-racts ( Fig. 124 ) , between which the river flows with a fall of less than an inch to the mile . The Nile Valley is narrow , rarely over 10 miles in width . The cultivated area , including the entire valley and delta , is about one fourth that of Illinois ( Fig. 125 ) . The Nile Floods . ? Of such unusual importance to millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing notice . In early summer the river is at its lowest . In June it be-gins to rise , and during August and September it spreads like a lake over its flood plain ; in late Sep-tember it is 20 feet above its low-water stage at Assuan ; then , suddenly , it begins to fall , subsid-ing almost as rapidly as it rose . Year after year with wonderful regularity this is repeated . The Egyptians have kept accurate records for 3000 years , and these show the average annual rise at Thebes to have been 36 feet . Under the old system of irriga-tion ( and to some extent even now ) a difference of six or eight feet in the height of the flood // water was a matter of serious importance . If the water rose too high , embankments broke and disaster followed . If it did not rise high enough to overflow the land , there was no crop , and famine followed . In 187x " nearly a million acres of land failed to receive water and there was great suffering among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nile . ? It is a strange fact that neither of the large branches which join the main river in the stretch south of Khartum supplies any appreciable amount of water to the Nile floods . The flood waters and their load of rich silt do not come from these headwaters , but from the Blue Nile and the Atbara , which are fed from the torrential summer rains in Abyssinia . Such a volume of water does the Blue Nile pour into the main channel at Khartum that it actually obstructs the flow of the White Nile , temporarily ponding it back into a great lake . When the flood of the Blue Nile subsides , the White Nile is able again to send its retarded waters on to Egypt . The supply of water from the lakes and swamps at the headwaters of the White Nile would naturally be quite constant , but this would give most of the valley no overflow , and without that there would be no fertile Egypt . Here is // an impressive illustration of the importance of a single geographic influence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? For ages the Egyptians irrigated such land as they could by crude methods . Embankments or dikes were built inclosing shallow " basins " on the flood plain . When the river rose high enough , it filled the basins with the muddy Nile water , which stood in them for six weeks or more . The mud settled to the bottom , and the water soaked deeply into the soil . When the river subsided , the surplus water was allowed to drain from the basins back into the river , and as soon as possible seed was sown in the wet ground . This method had two objections : ( 1 ) only one crop a year could be secured ; ( 2 ) only the land which was overflowed produced a crop , and the amount of such land varied according to the height of the river . Some additional land was irrigated by using crude pumps and water wheels operated by men or animals . Thousands of these are still in use , and travelers tell of the dreary groaning chorus of the pumps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . The Present System of Irrigation . ? Under the direction of the English engineers a great dam 14 miles long has been built across the Nile at Assuan near the first cataract ( Fig. 124 ) . Around the dam is a canal with four locks , enabling boats to pass . Through the dam are 180 openings with gates that can be opened and closed . By means of this dam the excess flood waters , which formerly flowed unused to the sea , are now stored in a great artificial lake that extends nearly 200 miles up the valley of the Nile . When the Nile subsides this stored water is released , and is directed into canals and carried over the land , enabling the people to raise two or more crops a year . More recently another great dam , reservoir , and irrigation system have been completed in the valley of the Blue Nile far up in the Sudan . Cotton of excellent quality is the most profitable crop , and Egypt ranks third in the world as a cotton-growing country ; but corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large quantities . Much more ground is now irrigated than formerly , larger crops are grown , the population has nearly doubled , and the country is pros176 HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY pering as never before . Other important improvements now under way are directed towards the irrigation of still more land . So productive are the flood plain and delta of the Nile that , although the area under cultivation is only one fourth of that of one of our medium-sized states , it supports 14,000,000 people . Portions of the delta have 1600 persons to the square mile , the densest agricultural population in the world . The Nile as a Waterway . ? Excepting at the rapids or " cataracts " the Nile is navigable for 2900 miles . It is still the main artery of traffic , although paralleled in part by a railroad . Swarms of the peculiar Nile boats , with their odd sails , and a considerable number of steamers navigate the river . The mouths of the river are practically useless for navigation because of sandbars and because of dams built to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nile water for irrigation . Cairo , once of great commer-cial importance , is at the apex of the delta , about 100 miles inland from the sea . Alexandria , the largest city in Africa , is on a spur of solid land at the mouth of one of the distributaries . Man and Nature in Egypt . ? The story of Egypt and the Nile illustrates two great principles in the field of geography . The dependence of 14,000,000 people upon a single , natural phe-nomenon , such as the annual rise of a river , shows the way in which // men are sometimes under the domination of their geographic environment . The Nile floods irrigated a strip of desert and it early became the seat of an enlightened empire . The second principle is illustrated by the splendid engineering feat , the building of the Assuan dam and its related devices for controlling and utilizing the floods an example of man 's conquest of nature and of his power to subjugate the forces of nature and make them serve him . THE GANGES AND INDIA Importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China , India is the most populous country in the world . Here , in an area half the size of the United States , are crowded together about twice as many people as live in the whole of North America . India has been a home of mankind for thousands of years , and the people have crowded into every province in about as great numbers as the land will support . When we discover that // nearly half of India 's great population live in one fifth of the country , we at once suspect that this one fifth must be a remarkable region ; and such it is , for its soil feeds nearly as many people as live in North and South America combined . This region is the valley of the Ganges River ? not one of the long rivers of the world , for it is only half the length of the Missouri . As one can not think of Egypt without thinking of the Nile , so one can not think of India apart from the Ganges . This river and its broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of its people for centuries . The great civilizations of antiquity grew up on the rich flood plains of Egypt , of Mesopotamia , of India , and of China . The rivers which built these flood plains have entered intimately into the history , the literature , the religion , and the life of the people . The inhabitants depend mainly upon agriculture , and the river whose waters and enriching silt give them their crops soon comes to be almost a god . As the ancient Egyptians worshiped the Nile , so millions of // Hindus worship the Ganges . Temples and shrines line its banks and hundreds of thousands of people yearly come to bathe in its sacred waters and thus , as they believe , to wash away their sins ( Fig. 128 ) . Benares , the most holy of their cities , has over a thousand temples and shrines . All this illustrates how a river that irrigates and fertilizes a people 's lands may so enter into their affections that they regard it as sacred . Features of the Valley . ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the heavy summer rains of its own valley . The rapid mountain streams which enter the Ganges from the north have brought down a great amount of gravel and fines sediment and have deposited it in the broad valley of the Ganges and Indus , partially filling it and crowding the Ganges southward almost to the edge of the valley . This process must have gone on for a long time , for the valley is now filled to a depth of many hun dreds of feet with the sediment . This is similar to the process by which the Great Valley of California has been filled . The Ganges has thus built a broad and fertile plain , and with the aid of the Bra hmaputra , which joins it from the east , is still engaged in ex-tending its delta out into the sea . A low , swampy , tiger-infested jungle reaching 200 miles back from the mouth of the river covers this rapidly extending delta . The principal distributary in the delta is the river Hooghly , on which the largest city of India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flood Plain . ? Hundreds of thousands of acres of the lowlands are planted to rice , the chief food of the people , and to jute to be exported or used for making cordage and bagging . The farms are tiny , the cultivation intensive , the people poor , and the farm villages almost as numerous as farmhouses in America . In the western half of the Ganges Valley the rain-fall is sufficient only for summer crops , and great irrigation works have been constructed by the British Government ; these are among the largest in the world . The soil is soft and warm , and is enriched by the periodical overflows . The amount of food produced is enormous , as it has to be to feed the vast population ( Fig. 129 ) . Nowhere else in India is the soil so // productive , and there is little wonder that the Hindus regard the river with reverence . Cities , Navigation , Railroads . ? The valley is dotted with famous cities , Calcutta , Benares , Agra , Delhi ( the present capital ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins of still others . Before the English built their railroads , the Ganges was the great thor oughfare of India . In 1876 ? 77 it is reported that 178,000 boats passed a certain point on the river . Small boats are still used , but steamers now rarely ascend beyond Calcutta . The valley is // traversed by many railroads and the river has yielded its traffic to them . THE YANGTZE AND CHINA Importance . ? The Yangtze is the principal river of the most populous country in the world . As a highway of commerce it serves more people than any other river . It is as long as the Mississippi and carries a much greater volume of water . Rising at an altitude of over 10,000 feet in Tibet , the headwaters plunge down a succession of falls and rapids , acquiring great erosive power , and supplying an enormous load of rock waste to be carried out across the lowlands of China for building up the flood plain and delta of the Yangtze ( Fig. 130 ) . Like the Ganges and the Amazon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This work of rivers has greatly increased the producing power of the earth , for alluvial plains supply a large proportion of the world 's food . A quarter of the human race lives in China , and the larger part of these are farmer folk tilling little pieces of alluvial land which has been laid down by China 's many rivers , notably the Yangtze and the Hwang . Features of the Yangtze . ? At its mouth is a delta of great size ; for 1000 miles above its mouth , the river flows through a plain of // its own making , intensively cultivated , teeming with people , and dotted with walled towns and cities . Like the lower Mississippi it has built up natural levees along both banks , and in many places the river channel is higher than the general level of the plain through which it flows . It will be recalled that this is common with silt-carrying rivers which periodically flood their valley bottoms . At Ichang begin the picturesque gorges which the river has cut through the mountain ranges that here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep mountain gorges recur for 400 miles through the mountainous belt that separates the plains of eastern and central China . In this 400-mile stretch there are said to be 13 important rapids and 72 minor ones . Beyond the gorges ( west ) lies Sze chwan , the most productive and populous of the many provinces // of China . In this rich interior basin , as large as California , live from 40 to 50 million people , and the only commercial highway between it and the outer world is the Yangtze . The Yangtze as a Highway of Commerce . ? China has few railways and the navigable rivers are of utmost importance . Near the mouth of the Yangtze is Shanghai , the chief commercial city of China . Ocean steamships ascend the river 600 miles to the great city of Hankow ( often called the Chicago of China ) , and large river steamers ascend to the rapids , which are navigable mainly by specially built Chinese junks and small boats . The junks carry 50 tons or more of freight . At high water the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and dangerous . The boats are laboriously hauled up the rapids by long lines of Chinese coolies , called " trackers " ( Fig. 131 ) . The largest boats require 200 to 300 men tugging at a bamboo rope a quarter of a mile long . Scores of men and boats are lost every year . The labor of the trackers is the most arduous in which any human beings regu184 HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY larly engage . For 12 hours a day they labor like draught horses , live on a little rice , and earn a mere pittance . Eight thousand junks and a quarter of a million river men carry on the commerce of the upper Yangtze . In this way , most of the merchandise and produce are conveyed in and out of interior China ; and almost the sole avenue for a vast traffic is the Yangtze . No other river means so much to the commerce of a nation as this river means to China . The Yangtze is to be remembered as a type of great river serving as a nation 's main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAST THE GLACIERS OF THE ALPS varies from a few inches t Origin and Movement . ? The peaks of the Alps are between two and three miles high and at this altitude the snow does not entirely melt during the summer ; each succeeding winter more is added until the piled-up snow in the snow fields becomes deep and heavy . So great is the weight that the snow and ice move slowly down the high mountain valleys in tongues of ice known as moon-tain glaciers or valley glaciers ; ofthese there are nearly 2000 in the Alps alone ( Fig. 133 ) . Their motion is like slow flow-age , and the rate of movement a few feet daily . They flow somewhat more rapidly at the top and middle than at the bottom and sides , where they are retarded by friction . Part way down the valley the end of the tongue of ice gradually melts and feeds some mountain stream . The constant melting of the glaciers during the summer tends to keep glacier-fed rivers more steady in their flow than other rivers . The longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in length , but most of them are much shorter . In places 187 // they are crossed by great open cracks and chasms called crevasses , into which stones fall and become eroding tools at the bottom of the ice . Erosion and Transportation . ? In the high mountains avalanches frequently plunge down the mountain sides , tearing away loose rock and carrying it down upon the snow fields or glaciers . Fragments of rock , large and small , slide and roll down the mountain slopes and are carried along by the moving ice . Valleys in which glaciers have worked for a long time become worn into U-shaped troughs ( Fig. 137 ) . Many such troughs are found where no glaciers now exist and they tell unmistakably of a period when glaciers occupied these valleys . Moraines . ? As the lower end of the , glacier melts , the earth , gravel , stones , and bowlders , mixed in the ice , pile up around the end forming what is known as a terminal moraine . Similar deposits along the sides of glaciers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glaciers of the Alps attract thousands of visitors every year . Excellent carriage and automobile roads have been constructed , and at sightly points hotels have been built . The Alps and their glaciers thus bring millions of dollars to the . mountain , people every summer . In fact , the scenery of Switzerland must be counted as one of the little country 's chief resources . EXISTING GLACIERS IN NORTH AMERICA Alaska . ? On the Pacific slope of the Alaskan mountains the snowfall is very heavy , and great numbers of glaciers exist ; these are much larger than the glaciers of the Alps . Hubbard Glacier is 40 miles long and 3 miles wide at its terminus . In Fig. 135 three of the largest Swiss glaciers are compared in size with one of the large Alaskan glaciers , and in Fig. 139 the front of a glacier is // shown in comparison with the height of the National Capitol at Washington . Tidal Glaciers and Icebergs . ? Many of the glaciers of Alaska and Greenland reach down to the sea , where great masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known as tidal glaciers ( Fig. 140 ) . Since ice is nearly as heavy as water , icebergs float with about seven eighths of their mass below the water and // so are very deceptive in appearance . Bergs of enormous size drift southward near Newfoundland and are a menace to Atlantic steamers ( Fig. 141 ) . The great Atlantic liner Titanic struck such a berg in 1912 and sank within a few minutes . Piedmont Glaciers ; the Malaspina . ? In certain regions such as Alaska , several mountain glaciers , flowing down neighboring valleys , sometimes unite at the base of the mountains into a broad , low plateau of ice . The Malaspina Glacier in Alaska is such a gla cier ( Fig. 142 ) ; it has an area of 1500 square miles , which is more than that of Rhode Island . This glacier remained stationary for a time ; the surface ice melted during the summers and gradually the glacier became covered with soil ; trees and shrubs took root , and a forest 20 to 35 square miles in area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice Cap . ? Greenland is four times the size of France ; with the exception of a narrow border near the coast , it is entirely covered by snow and ice , the accumulation of centuries . // This plateau of ice has a very slow movement from the middle outward toward the sea ; some distance back from the shore the ice collects in valleys that fringe the coast and moves down to the sea in the form of valley glaciers . These valleys end in deep bays or fiords where the ice breaks off and floats away as icebergs . It is known that the fiords themselves are mainly due to prolonged erosion by the tongues of glacial ice . // Other Glaciers in North America . ? Glaciers occur in the Canadian Rockies , and still smaller ones in Glacier National Park in Montana , and on high peaks in the Cascade Range , and even in Mexico . Glaciers in Other Parts of the World . ? There are many valley glaciers in the southern Andes , and also a few small ones near the equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciers in the Caucasus and Himalaya mountains , in Norway and New Zealand , and in islands of the Arctic Ocean . The continent of Antarctica is covered by the largest ice cap now existing . It is more extensive than Europe and resembles the Greenland ice cap , but is much larger . Valley Glaciers Once Larger and More Numerous Than Now . ? In the Alps , the Caucasus , the Rockies , and elsewhere , glaciers once occupied valleys where there are at present no glaciers , and existing glaciers reached many miles farther down their valleys than they do now . This is known by the moraines which they built and which are now conspicuous features of the valleys where glaciers have been . This and other facts show that valley glaciers in many parts of the world are shrinking , and would seem to indicate either that the earth 's climate on the whole is slowly becoming warmer , or that less snow is falling than formerly . CONTINENTAL GLACIERS OF THE PAST Evidences That Glaciers of Grea ave Existed in North America and Europe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied for more than a century . Their movement , their power to erode and to carry rock debris , and their habit of depositing moraines have long been understood . It was noted that the moraines contained various kinds of bowlders and rock fragments brought by the ice from higher portions of the mountains . The rock sides and bottoms of valleys in which glaciers had moved were seen to be eroded , and even polished , by the moving ice . Such surfaces are marked by parallel scratches ( called strice ) and . even by deep grooves running in the direction that the ice moved ( Fig. 143 ) , and pebbles in the moraines are often worn and striated. // In short , European geologists had become familiar with the signs of former glaciers at the base of the Alps long before they suspected that ice sheets had spread over a third of Europe and nearly half of North America . Discovery of Glacial Evidences in the United States . ? About 1850 the Swiss naturalist , Louis Agassiz ( ag'a-se ) , who had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and striae that looked like those left " iy glaciers in the Alps . He announced his belief that theta sometime been glaciers in parts of the United States . Many scientists could not believe it , and fanciful theories were invented to account for these bowlders and moraines . But every year more evidence was discovered , all leading unmistak ably to the conclusion that a great continental ice sheet must have once spread over Canada and the northern United States . Nature of These Evidences . Glacial Bowlders or Erratics . ? In most parts of our northeastern and north-central states one may find bowlders of many different kinds of rock , some of which are entirely unlike the bed rock found in the region ; they are called erratics , meaning wanderers . Sometimes they are of enormous // size ( Fig. 144 ) . In parts of New England they are so numerous as to interfere seriously with farming , while in parts of Illinois scarcely one can be found . In some instances these bowlders have been traced back to rock ledges from which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of miles to the north or northeast . Strive . ? Frequently when a covering of earth is removed , the surface of the underlying rock is found to be marked by parallel // scratches and grooves , showing that glaciers have moved over them and also showing the direction of their movement ( Fig. 143 ) . Moraines . ? When detailed maps of our northern states were made , ranges of hills , composed of sand ; gravel , clay , and bowlders , were found to extend for miles across the country . These proved to be glacial moraines , built up of materials brought by glaciers and deposited when the ice melted . One may see this taking place now in the Alps or in Alaska on a smaller scale . These and other evidences carefully studied for a half century so completely prove the former existence of a great continental ice sheet in North America that we are as sure of the fact as if we had actually seen the glacier itself . Extent of the North American Ice Sheet . ? During the Glacial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two principal centers , one in Labrador and one west of Hudson Bay ( Fig. 145 ) . It appears that at these places the greatest amount of snow accumulated , reaching a depth of thousands of feet . The // weight or pressure became so great that , as in Greenland at present , the whole body of snow took on a slow movement , mainly toward the south , and was not stopped until it reached a region where the southern climate melted it . At the same time that the great depth of snow was collecting at these centers , valley glaciers were forming in all of the higher mountains of the northern half of the continent . The glacial ice pushed as far south as Pennsylvania , the Ohio River , and the Missouri River , covering the highest peaks of the Adirondacks and the New England mountains . In southwestern Wisconsin , extending a little into Minnesota , Iowa , and Illinois , there is an area of about 15,000 square miles which , for some reason , was not covered by the glacier ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 146 ) . The European Ice Sheet . Another continental glacier spread southward from the north of Europe as far as central Russia , central Germany , and southern England ( Fig. 147 ) . CHANGES MADE BY CONTINENTAL GLACIERS Erosion . ? The slowly moving ice plowed its way over hills and mountains , through valleys and over plains . Loose rocks and soil became mixed with the ice and were also carried along . Projecting ledges of rock were plucked and worn away ; hill tops and mountain tops were partially rounded off , and some valleys were considerably eroded ( Fig. 137 ) . The large features of the land , however , such as the highest hills , the mountains , and the main valleys , were changed only in minor details . Glacial Drift . In parts of Canada and New England the glaciers scraped off much of the soil and carried it southward , causing serious loss to these regions ; but the area south of the Great Lakes , and other regions where there was deposition rather than removal , received large deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In some places former valleys were entirely filled and streams were compelled to find new courses . Terminal moraines were heaped up along the margin of the ice , marking places where the front of the glacier stood for a considerGLACIERS // able time , melting along the front as fast as the ice moved up from behind ( Fig. 148 ) . As the ice melted it dropped the rock and earth which it carried , and in the course of time built up morainic hills , often a hundred feet or more in height , in belts several miles wide , and extending for scores or even hundreds of miles in length ( Fig. 148 ) . The front of the glacier was a series of lobes which projected forward in the valleys and lowlands . We can now tell where the ice lobes were by the great loops of moraine which mark their former positions . Each terminal moraine marks a place where the front of the glacier stood for a long time during its intermittent retreat toward the north at the close of the Ice Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the glacier melted or receded rather steadily , pausing nowhere long enough to heap up terminal moraines ; instead , the glacial drift laid down by the melting ice was spread somewhat unevenly over the surface in what is called a till sheet or ground moraine ( Fig. 150 ) . In places // this is only a few inches or a few feet deep , but may be all the way up to a few hundred feet deep , as in the states from Ohio westward to the Missouri River ; these glacial plains are one cause of the agricultural excellence of the north-central states . Outwash Plains . ? As the glacier , with its included load of rock waste , melted , it yielded a great amount of water which flowed away from the ice , and , where the land sloped away from the glacier , built outwash plains . These differ from ground moraine in being made of water-sorted material ( sand , clay , and gravel ) roughly stratified and nearly level . The total area covered by out-wash plains in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obstructed . ? Both the terminal moraine and the ground moraine seriously obstructed the former courses of streams . In some cases rivers were forced to reverse the direction of their flow ; in others they were forced to wind in and out among the morainic hills in entirely new courses , giving rise to rapids and falls . Lakes Due to Glaciers . ? The heaps of moraine dumped in the valleys by the glaciers act as dams ; the streams are thus obstructed , and lakes are produced ( Fig. 151 ) . This is the com monest cause of lakes , and in most regions where glaciers have existed , lakes are numerous . The beautiful lakes of Switzerland , // Scotland , and England are mainly due to glaciers . There are many thousands of these in Finland , Sweden , and Canada ; New England is dotted with them . The beautiful lakes of New York , New Jersey , Wisconsin , and Minnesota are of the same origin . Some of these bodies of water occupy rock basins which were eroded or scoured out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the damming of streams by moraines . The Great Lakes . ? The five Great Lakes , lying along the Canadian border , are due to glacial work . They occupy old river basins which have been eroded and deepened by the ice lobes that moved through them , while masses of moraine form low dams across the basins . Swamps . ? The obstruction of streams by glacial deposits also caused many swamps or marshes . These are more or less numer ous over the entire glaciated area , and in all cover millions of acres . Many of the shallowest glacial lakes have become filled with sedi ment and vegetation and now are merely swamps . // The Value of Lakes . ? The lakes of our northern states are a large asset . Their shores are delightful places for homes , summer cottages and hotels , and sanitariums . They attract ever increas-ing numbers of people who seek rest and enjoyment and who bring into the region a large sum of money . As sources of ice , fish , and water for cities these lakes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Lakes , forming the greatest inland waterway in the world , has already been discussed in Chapter VIII . Waterfalls . ? It is safe to say that nine tenths of the waterfalls in the glaciated area of the United States would not exist if glaciers had not interfered with the former courses of the streams . Glacial drift fills or partly fills many of the preglacial valleys , and streams are forced to flow in new and ungraded channels . Ilere and there these streams plunge over rock ledges , and waterfalls are produced . At such places , water power is available and leads to important industries . Niagara Falls , the falls at Minneapolis , at Rochester , N. Y. , at Paterson , N. J. , and at hundreds of other places in New England , New York , Wisconsin , and elsewhere , are due to changes caused by glaciers . Glacial Soil . ? In much of New England and eastern Canada the glacier removed the original soil and left large areas strewn with bowlders ; in general this proved an injury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches of glacial plains form one of the garden spots of the earth . Investigations in the states of Wisconsin , Illinois , and Ohio lead to the belief that agriGLACIERS // culture in these states benefits yearly to the extent of millions of dollars through the smoothing of the topography due to glacial deposits ( Fig. 150 ) . Temporary Lakes of the Glacial Period . ? A portion of Minne sota and the Dakotas and most of central Canada slopes toward the north , and the rivers flow in that general direction . Since the glaciers came from the north and northeast , and melted back from the south toward the north , the ice formed temporary dams in the valleys of these north-flowing rivers and thus lakes were formed . One of the largest of these , known as Lake Agassiz , covered an area greater than that covered by all of the five Great Lakes together ( Fig. 152 ) . It occupied the valley of the Red River of the North , and while it lasted , drained southward through the Minnesota River into the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake drained northward into Ilud son Bay and shrank to what is now Lake Winnipeg in Mani- which this lake lepost ItP.d over its bed now constitutes very rich soil over an almost perfectly level plain . Various Stages of the Great Lakes . ? When the glacial lobes were slowly melting from the basins now occupied by the Great Lakes , marginal lakes of varying sizes occupied the southern and western portions of the lake basins . In an early stage each of these marginal lakes had its own outlet into the Mississippi // ( Fig. 153 ) . At a much later stage ( Fig. 154 ) they drained eastward by way of the Mohawk-Hudson Valley . Between these stages many different outlets were used . Epochs of the Glacial Period .  --  Careful study of glacial deposits shows that the last Ice Age had several epochs of cold climate alternating with epochs of warm climate ; ( luring the latter the ice front withdrew toward the north and remained for many thousands of years . These warmer epochs are referred to as interglacial periods . It is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that thousands of years hence our northern states may again be buried beneath a great ice sheet . Very Ancient Glacial Periods . The Glacial Period of which we have been speaking occurred in a recent geological age . It is often spoken of as having occurred but yesterday . This was only one of many glacial periods that have come and gone during the long ages of the past . Glacial bowlders , glacial strive , and consolidated glacial drift are found in rocks of great age in Brazil , South Africa , India , Australia , Canada , Scandinavia , and elsewhere . It is clear that the climate of the earth undergoes great changes and that glacial periods have occurred time after time throughout the p zst. // Sunf1A11T Glaciers occur wherever the amount of snow which falls each year in the mountains is greater than the amount which melts . In these regions snow accumulates and is compressed into ice , which flows slowly down the mountain valleys . The rate of flow is usually a few inches or , at the most , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciers or are plucked from ledges along the route , and some of these rocks , firmly frozen in the bottom of the glacier , act as tools for eroding the valley down which the ice is moving . Where the ice melts terminal moraines are built . There are hundreds of valley glaciers , mostly small ones , in the Alps . Alaska has still more and larger valley glaciers , many of which move down to the bays and fiords and break off to form icebergs . The fiords of Alaska , Norway , and other regions are mainly due to prolonged glacial erosion . Nearly all of the lofty mountain ranges , even in the tropics , have valley glaciers . Green-land and the Antarctic Continent have slowly moving ice caps covering almost their entire surface . // During the last 60 or 70 years complete proof of the presence of former glaciers of great size in North America and Europe has been established through the evidences of glacial striae , erratics , moraines , etc . The European ice sheet , with its principal center in Scandinavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , and central Russia . In North America the principal centers from which the glaciers moved were in Labrador , and in Canada just west of Hudson Bay . The ice sheet extended as far south as New Jersey and Pennsylvania , the Ohio River , and the Missouri River . In places the glaciers eroded the land considerably , carry ing away the soil , rounding off-the tops of hills and mountains , and deepening valleys . In our north-central states a great amount of glacial drift was deposited in the form of terminal and ground mo raines and glacial outwash . South of the Great Lakes the drift is scores and even hundreds of feet deep in places . The glacial depos its have greatly interfered with the courses of streams , causing lakes , swamps , rapids , and falls . The glacial plains of the north-central states are among our finest agricultural lands . Temporary lakes occurred in places along the southern border of the retreating ice sheet ; one of these , Lake Agassiz , as large as all the Great Lakes together , occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were alternating periods of advance and retreat of the ice front , giving several glacial and interglacial epochs , each thousands of years long . The last glacial period came to a close in a recent geological age , perhaps not over 30,000 years ago . It was one of many such periods which have occurred at intervals during the history of the earth . // CHAPTER XI SURFACE CHANGES PRODUCED FROM WITHIN The Continents and the Ocean Basins . ? The continents are large masses of the earth 's crust which rise above the level of the sea , yet none of the continents is wholly above sea level . All of them have borders , called continental shelves , which are covered by shallow ocean water ; thus the continents are larger than they appear on the map . At the seaward edge of the continental shelves the ocean floor slopes downward somewhat abruptly to the ocean depths . The ocean basins are believed to be portions of the crust that have settled ; in sinking they have pressed with great force against the margins of the continents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plateaus . Observed Movements of the Earth 's Crust . ? Most of the upward or downward movements of the earth 's crust are very slow , but in some instances the change of level is rapid ; for example , in an Alaskan earthquake ( in 1899 ) a portion of the coast rose 47 feet , while a near-by portion settled several feet . There are abundant records of slower movements ; for example , in northern Sweden , in the Bay of Naples , and in the island of Crete in the Mediterranean . On the coasts of Labrador , of California , of Peru , and in many other places , old shore lines are now scores or hundreds of feet above the present sea level . So common is this rising or sinking that almost every coast bears evidence of it . Condition of the Earth 's Interior . ? Volcanoes , geysers , and hot springs show that below the crust of the earth , in certain places , at least , there is great heat . Well borings and deep mines reveal an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 or 60 feet of descent . Not long ago people believed the interior of the earth to be com posed of molten or liquefied rock . Although the deep-seated rocks 210 // are very hot , recent investigations prove that the interior of the earth is solid and is more rigid than a globe of steel ; nevertheless , there are places where the rocks are melted and come to the surface as lava . EARTHQUAKES Earthquakes Very Common . ? If every earthquake were known and reported , we should find that they are of almost constant occurrence at one place or another . It is estimated that an average of nearly 100 earthquakes , which would be perceptible to our senses , occur daily . Most of these , and many still weaker tremors , are known only through the records made by instruments which auto matically record even slight movements of the crust . Occasionally there are shocks of great violence , and when the latter occur in the neighborhood of cities , heavy loss of property and life results . Such earthquakes are among nature 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco had an earthquake in 1906 , which in itself did serious damage ( Figs. 155 , 156 ) . The loss from fire was , however , still greater , for the broken water mains prevented the effective fighting of fire , which gained such headway that it destroyed about 25,000 buildings . The Charleston earthquake of 1886 is thus described : " Strange noises were heard and slight tremors were felt before the earthquake , notably on August 27 and 28 . Just before ten o'clock at night on the 31st a rumbling sound was heard , increasing to a great roar , and the shaking became violent . There was a second violent shock a few minutes afterwards , and a number of aftershocks of lesser violence . The earthquake wave spread at the rate of 150 miles a minute , and was felt in many states ; 14,000 chimneys were thrown down and 27 persons were killed . " The terrible Lisbon earthquake of 1755 is reported to have caused the death of 60,000 people in six minutes . Southern Italy has had repeated earthquakes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of 100,000 lives . Japan is subject to daily earthquakes , having an average of 1400 recorded tremors and shocks a year ; most of // them are light , yet 223 very destructive shocks are known to have occurred in that country in the last 1500 years . Causes of Earthquakes . ? The earth is still in the making ; because of the slow contraction due to the loss of heat and other causes , the rocks of the earth 's surface are constantly under great stress , so great that at times they break along some plane of weakness and one side is forced violently up or down or sidewise ( Fig. 157 ) . The displacement varies in amount from a few inches to many feet , and may occur along a line scores of miles in length . This breaking of the rocks under stress is the chief cause of earthquakes , but there are minor causes of small importance , such as // avalanches , the falling in of the roofs of caves , and the discharge of explosives . Movement of Earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep-seated rocks , only those rocks near the surface are able to break and slip , and thus to produce a tremor or quake . At great depths the rocks flow rather than fracture . Directly over the line along which the fracturing of rock occurs , the shock sets up " waves , " or vibrations , in the earth 's crust , and these have a nearly up-and-down movement which is very destructive , but as the waves spread outward from the place of origin , they become less and less dangerous . The waves thus started pass both around the earth and through it , accomplishing the latter in about 20 minutes . The great velocity with which these waves travel through the earth is one of the evidences that the earth 's interior is solid . The Principal Earthquake Zones . Both earthquakes and volcanoes are most common in regions of young , growing mountains , where rock stresses are great . Such mountains nearly encircle the Pacific Ocean . The Mediterranean Sea and the East and West . Indies are also regions of frequent earthquakes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain building was especially active , earthquakes must have been very frequent . // SUMMARY Earthquakes occur at frequent intervals somewhere in the earth , but most of them do little harm ; occasionally one of unusual violence occurs near a city and causes great loss of property and life . Earthquake waves travel very rapidly , passing through the earth in about 20 minutes . Japan has an average of 1400 recorded quakes a year , but most of them are of slight force . Earthquake shocks and tremors are due chiefly to fracturing and slipping of bodies of rock at or near the surface of the earth , and are most frequent in regions of young , growing mountains such as those which nearly encircle the Pacific Ocean , or those in the south of Europe , in the East Indies , and in the West Indies . VOLCANOES Two Types of Volcanoes . ? In the quiet type of volcanoes , such as those of the Hawaiian Islands , lava rises in the throat of the crater and from time to time spills over the rim or breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sluggish stream , cooling as it flows ( Fig. 159 ) . Volcanic cones built up in this way are broad in proportion to their height . In the explosive type , the volcano may slumber for a long time , perhaps for centuries as in the case of Vesuvius ; then rumblings are heard , steam issues from the crater , and soon a terrific explosion occurs . Steam , ash , cinders , and pieces of volcanic rock are hurled into the air and fall in a shower upon the surrounding country ( Fig. 159 ) . This explosion is usually , though not always , followed by the outpouring of lava . Sometimes clouds of suffocating gases pour from the crater and settle over the surrounding country , destroying every living thing . In the eruption of Mont Pelee on the border of the Caribbean Sea ( 1902 ) every person , except one , in the near-by city of St. Pierre was killed . Famous Volcanoes . ? Of the 400 to 500 active volcanoes on the earth a few have become famous . Vesuvius ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had several outbursts of great violence , one of them burying the fine old Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum // in the year 79 A.D. Etna , on the island of Sicily near Italy , and Stromboli , on a near-by island , are also historic volcanoes . Krakatoa , on an island southeast of Asia , had ( in 1883 ) one of the most terrific explosions ever known ; windows were broken a hundred miles away ; half of the island was hurled into the air , and water 1000 feet deep now occupies the , place where this half of the island was . The wave occasioned by the explosion swept over the ocean to the far-off coasts of Africa , Australia , and California ; dust from the volcano was carried by high air currents entirely around the earth , and some of it continued to float for more than two years . Mauna Loa , Mauna Kea , and Kilauea are widely known volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands . Many of the loftiest peaks of South America , of Mexico , and of western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hood , and Mt . Rainier , are volcanic cones ( Fig. 161 ) . The towering cone of Mt . Fujiyama in Japan , // which appears in many Japanese pictures , is almost a national idol . Fissure Eruptions . ? At different times in the past enormous quantities of lava have risen through fissures , or vents in the crust of the earth , and have spread over the surrounding country in a lake of molten rock . In the basin of the Columbia and Snake rivers in Washington , Idaho , Oregon , and northern California , out pourings of this kind have taken place repeatedly in past ages . The different beds of lava formed by the successive outflows hard ened into rock and now lie one upon the other , in some places at220 HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY taining a total depth of 4000 feet ( Fig. 163 ) . Ilills and mountains were buried in the lava and their tops now rise above it like islands . This plateau of igneous rock extends over an area of more than 200,000 square miles ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north of Ireland , and several other regions have had similar lava flows . The soil which is formed by the decay of this lava is often very productive . Causes of Volcanoes . ? These are not well understood , but the following points appear to be true : ( 1 ) that the interior of the earth is not liquid , but that ( 2 ) there are places ' where , for some cause , reservoirs or huge pockets of molten rock exist ; ( 3 ) that this molten rock is squeezed upward through vents by the great weight // of solid rock above it , causing the quiet type of volcano and the great outflows of lava through fissures ; ( 4 ) that the explosive volcanoes are due either to steam produced by water coming in contact with heated rocks below the surface , or , more likely , to steam and other vapors contained in the lava itself . Distribution of Volcanoes . ? The volcanic belts of the earth coincide closely with the earthquake belts ( Fig. 165 ) . Volcanoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the Pacific Ocean . They also occur in the Mediterranean region , in the West Indies , in the East Indies , Iceland ; East Africa , and on many scat tered islands ; in fact , about two thirds of the active volcanoes are on islands . Many of these are regions of growing mountains . Volcanic cones frequently rise from the sea bottom , building up volcanic islands , such as the Hawaiian group and many others in the Pacific . Regions of old mountains and the interiors of conti nents are relatively free from active volcanoes . Only one volcano in the United States has been active since white men came to America , Lassen Peak in California , which erupted in 1915. // SUMMARY Volcanoes of the quiet type , such as those of the Hawaiian Islands , from time to time pour forth lava which spreads out and builds up broad , gently sloping cones . These and the great out-flows from fissures seem to be due to the squeezing upward of lava , perhaps caused by the pressure of the overlying rocks . Volcanoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are treacherous and dangerous ; they sometimes blot out entire cities by the showers of ashes and cinders and the clouds of suffo-cating gases which they emit . The cones built by such volcanoes are usually high and pointed and form some of the loftiest peaks in the world . In several parts of the earth lava has risen through fissures , has spread over thousands of square miles , and has built up lava plateaus such as the Columbia River Plateau and the " Deccan " of India . The cause of explosive volcanoes is not well understood but seems to be connected with steam and other vapors confined in the lava . A great volcanic belt nearly encircles the Pacific Ocean . There are volcanoes on the margins of other con-tinents and on islands , but not many in the interiors of continents . CHAPTER XII SURFACE FEATURES OF THE LAND ; THEIR ORIGIN AND INFLUENCE The major features of the land are : ( 1 ) mountains , ( 2 ) plateaus , and ( 3 ) plains . Hills and Mountains . ? In a comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred feet high a mountain , while in some other region a much higher elevation is called a hill . The so-called Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts attain a height of over 2000 feet , and the Black Hills in South Dakota and Wyoming rise to over 7000 feet . However , the word hill is usually 224 // applied to a low elevation , while the word mountain is applied to an elevation measured in thousands of feet and having a small area at the top . Origin of Mountain Ranges . ? Mountain ranges may be thought of as wrinkles in the earth 's crust due to the shrinking , or contracting , of the interior . The contracting has sometimes been attributed to cooling , but this is probably not the only cause , and possibly not the chief cause . At any rate our globe has undergone a slight shrinking and this has compelled the outer shell to wrinkle . Volcanic Activity in Mountains . ? Volcanoes are not confined to mountainous regions , for they are found also in the ocean ; but they most commonly occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth is much fractured , giving opportunity for the escape of lava . Here movements of the crust are taking place , tremendous pressure and great heat are developed , and other conditions favorable to volcanic activity exist . Many of the loftiest peaks in the younger mountain ranges are volcanic cones . Mountains the Skeleton of the Continent . ? The shape of a continent is much influenced by the direction and length of its mountain ranges , as may be seen in relief maps . The mountain skeleton of South America , for example , consists of one long , continuous system ( the Andes ) along the west coast , a plateau with // short ranges in eastern Brazil , and another plateau in Venezuela at the north . The broad areas between these mountains are plains made of the sediments carried down from the mountains . The shape of South America is very closely determined by its mountains . Europe has many ranges and spurs extending in various directions ; one range forms the backbone of Scandinavia ; another forms Italy ; a mountainous plateau makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges and spurs ex-tending southward ; and the British Isles were formerly a partially mountainous peninsula projecting from the continent . Most large peninsulas are due to mountain ranges or plateaus , but there are exceptions , such as Florida . The Sculpturing of Mountains . As soon as a part of the earth 's crust rises above the surrounding level , it is attacked by the agents of weathering and erosion . The uplifting of the rocks fractures // them , and the weathering agents and the mountain streams ply their destructive work to better advantage . The loosened portions of rock creep or slide or are washed down the slopes , and the face of the rock is exposed anew to the weather ( Fig. 168 ) . Thus , mountains are denuded much more rapidly than plains because their steeper slopes are not able to retain a covering of soil and vegetation to protect them from further attacks of the weather . Mountain Peaks and Passes . Mountain peaks ( which are not due to volcanoes ) are resistant portions of the ranges . Wherever the mountain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots of trees , and other agents of waste work most effectively , and in such places notches and , possibly , passes are made , leaving the more solid and resistant rock standing up in the form of peaks ( Fig. 167 ) , . In the notches , streams may head , and flow in opposite directions , and by their headwater erosion they may still further lower the notch , un til it becomes a pass across the range . Such a pass may be used by a railroad in crossing the mountains . Most of the wild scenery of the mountains arises from this work of weather , ice , and water eat230 HIGH SCHOOL . GEOGRAPHY ing away portions of the rocks and leaving other portions towering upward as peaks , domes , and spires ( Figs. 168 , 169 ) . Old and Young Mountains . ? In their youth , mountains become sculptured , as described in the preceding paragraph . Sharp peaks , steep slopes , jagged cliffs , and narrow gorges characterize most young mountains ; but with the passing of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less steep , and the peaks are rounded off ( Fig. 170 ) . If , during this process , the region is not uplifted , and the denudation continues for a great length of time , the highland will be worn down to a rolling plain . Such a surface is called a peneplain , meaning " almost a plain . " The Blue Ridge and the mountains of New England , for example , are low , round-topped , and billowy ( Fig. 169 ) , because they are very old , while the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas , the Alps and Himalayas , with their sharp peaks , deep gorges , and precipitous cliffs , are relatively young ( Fig. 168 ) . TILE INFLUENCE OF MOUNTAINS ON MAN AND HIs ACTIVITIES Altitude and Temperature . On an average , temperature diminishes one degree for each 330 feet of ascent ; thus , an ascent of a mile in the torrid zone , for example , becomes equivalent to traveling poleward 800 to 1000 miles . At high altitudes the atmosphere is thin , and whatever heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air and out into space , so that the highest peaks are cold and snow-capped the year round , even in the torrid zone . Because of their elevation , plateaus within the tropics are cool , and people find them agreeable places in which to live . In Mexico , Colombia , Venezuela , Ecuador , Peru , and Bolivia , the capital cities and many of the other cities are built at altitudes of from five to eight thousand feet above the sea . In India the English officials , merchants , and others who are able to do so , go to the mountains during the hot summer , and even the capital or seat of government is temporarily moved there . The same practice is followed by many Americans in the Philippines and by the Dutch in Java . In short , it is only by taking advantage of the // coolness of the mountains and plateaus that white people living in the tropics can retain health and vigor . Rainfall and Agriculture . Winds blowing over mountains are forced to rise ; this air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of its moisture on the windward side ( Fig. 206 ) . For example , the rainfall on the west slope of the Cascade Mountains in Washington is several times as great as the average for the half of the state lying east of these mountains . By their direct and indirect effects the mountains of western United States render nearly 500,000,000 acres of our country unfit for agriculture ; this region , four times the area of France , has a population of less than 5,000,000 . Erosion and Overloading of Streams . As previously explained , weathering and stream erosion go on rapidly in mountains . The streams become heavily loaded with rock waste ( Fig. 171 ) , which they carry to the chief rivers , overburdening them , silting up their channels to the injury of navigation , and increasing the danger of floods . The Platte , Arkansas , and Missouri , heading in the Rocky Mountains , carry such enormous loads of silt that they are of scarcely any use for navigation . It is well to note in passing that most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth are made of materials eroded from the mountains , and that the rich alluvium which the Nile and other rivers spread over their flood plains is mostly brought from the same source . Mountains as Forest Reserves . ? When man takes possession of a new land , he clears the forests from the lowlands in order to use them for agriculture . But not so in the mountains ; by their inaccessibility and unfitness for agriculture they have little attraction for man , and they therefore become a natural timber preserve from which he may supply his needs when the more accessible timber is gone . Moreover , these mountain forests serve a highly important purpose in controlling the run-off and thus checking what might be disastrous floods . Our government is buying up large tracts of forest land in the Appalachian Mountains to be held for this very purpose . // Mountains and Grazing . ? Although mountains are unfavorable to agriculture , they usually contain tracts of land where cattle , sheep , and goats may graze . The rugged lands of Europe support many millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , and goats in Italy and the Balkan states . Our principal sheep-raising states , Montana and Wyoming , are both mountainous . Wherever the land is too rugged for cultivating crops , men turn to the grazing industries . This is also true in regions where rainfall is too light for growing crops , as in a great part of Australia . Mountains and Mining . ? In the mountain-building process the rocks are broken and cracks penetrate in all directions . In many instances mountain building is also attended by volcanic outbursts . The heat sets underground waters and vapors in motion , and these dissolve deep-seated minerals and carry them upward to the sur face , where they are deposited in the cracks and fissures of the // rocks , forming mineral veins , as described in an earlier chapter . Later the vigorous weathering and erosion which take place in mountains bring these veins into view and prospectors discover them ; thus the mountains are the chief sources of gold , silver , ' copper , and many other metals . There are exceptions to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own Appalachians are rather barren in metallic minerals , while mineral deposits are found in nonmountainous regions , as , for example , the lead and zinc deposits of Wisconsin and Missouri . Mountains as Barriers . High mountains are difficult to cross ; animals , birds , and native plants may differ considerably on oppo site sides of a high range . The building of roads and railroads across mountains is difficult , and expensive ( Fig. 175 ) . As a result only two good roads cross the Caucasus Mountains , and only a few cross the Pyrenees . Throughout its length of 5000 miles only one // railroad completely crosses the Andes chain . One of the serious drawbacks to the development of the Andean countries of South America is the enormous difficulty of getting from the Pacific coast over the Andes into the interior of these countries . For example , a ton of coal which normally costs $10 or $12 at a port of Peru or northern Chile , costs from $50 to $60 a ton when it reaches interior Bolivia . It is exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , camp equipment , etc. , over mountains to invade the countries on the other side . So great are the advan tages possessed by the defenders of mountain passes and roads that invaders frequently find it impossible to dislodge them . For these and other reasons , mountain ranges are good boundary lines between nations . Mountains and Population . ? The severe climate , scanty soil , difficulties of travel and transportation , and limited industries // usually deter any very large number of people from settling in mountains . In ten of our western states there are no more people than live in New York City alone . The more level parts of New York State have an average density of population more than 20 times as great as that of the mountainous parts . The plain of northern India has nearly 200 million people , while an equal area in the mountainous plateau of Tibet just north has not even one million . On the other hand , mountainous Switzerland is more densely peopled than lowland Denmark , and in the tropical part of South America the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sultry lowlands . Peculiarities of Mountain Peoples . ? Some mountain regions are so isolated that the people who live in them seldom come in // contact with people from the outside . They retain quaint , oldfashioned ways ; have odd customs , superstitions , and modes of speech ; dress peculiarly ; and preserve ideas and practices that may have disappeared elsewhere centuries before . Only a few of many illustrations can be given here . The mountain whites of the South are strikingly unlike the people outside the mountains ( Fig. 177 ) . Many of them have little education , rarely see newspapers or magazines , dress in homespun and homemade clothing , cling to old superstitions , are suspicious of strangers , and use many words and expressions that have passed out of use elsewhere . Many of these people never saw a trolley car or railway train , a mowing machine or a steamboat . In the mountains of Wales there are some 500,000 people who can not speak or understand English , although Wales has been united with England for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people numbering half a million , known as the Basques . They and their ancestors have been there so long that no reliable trace of their origin can be found . Their language shows no connection with any existing European language . France and Spain have been invaded and overrun by foreign foes time after time ; wave after wave of invasion and conquest has rolled up to the base of the Pyrenees ; but the Basques in their mountain retreat have remained for 2000 years or more almost untouched by any of these changes . The Caucasus Mountains are a veritable museum of peoples and // languages . Almost every important valley shelters a different tribe . It is said that Jewish families in the Caucasus still give their children names that were in use in Israel 2500 years ago , but which have long since dropped from use elsewhere . The great difficulty of conquering mountain peoples is shown by the fact that Russia was able to subjugate 4,000,000 square miles in Siberia before the tribes of the Caucasus were brought under subjection . Such mountains are nature 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there live untouched by the influence of events outside . PLATEAUS Definition of Plateau . ? Just as there is confusion between the terms hill and mountain , so there is indefiniteness in the terms plain and plateau . For instance , at the eastern base of the Appalacians an upland less than 2000 feet in elevation is called the Piedmont Plateau , while the region just east of the Rocky Mountains is known as the Great Plains , although the elevation reaches 5000 feet . The term plateau is applied to a land form of large area and considerable elevation ( usually some thousands of feet ) which rises rapidly above the adjacent land on one or more sides . The Great Plains east of the Rocky Mountains have no such rapid rise on any side , and that may account for their classification as plains . Types of Plateaus . The Columbia River Plateau , built up of many layers of solidified lava , is described elsewhere . The Colorado Plateau , in which the Grand Canon of Arizona has been eroded , is made of many beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great thickness of rock has since been removed by erosion , the surface of the plateau still has an elevation of over 8000 feet . On the western side of the Appalachian highland is the Allegheny Plateau . Its steep eastern edge is often referred to as the Allegheny Mountains . A part of this plateau , lying in New York just west of the Hudson River , has an elevation of over 4000 feet , and is there called the Catskill Mountains . Into the Allegheny Plateau rivers have eroded a maze of steep-sided valleys ? // some of them 2000 feet in depth . Between certain layers of rock are beds of coal ; in fact , the Allegheny Plateau from Pennsylvania to Alabama is the greatest coal-mining region of the United States . In West Virginia , for example , the plateau is so cut into great hills and valleys that the region appears to be mountainous , and is usually so called ( Fig. 172 ) . Arabia is a vast desert plateau , and Africa is a plateau continent . The loftiest plateau in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevation of 15,000 feet and having upon it mountain ranges that rise 14,000 feet higher ; Mt . Everest , the highest of the Himalayas , exceeds 29,000 feet . It becomes evident , then , that plateaus are not usually flat-topped table-lands , although some of them would be comparatively flat if streams had not cut valleys and canons in them . Life on High Plateaus. ? In the temperate zone high plateaus are cool in summer and bleak in winter . They are often wind-swept and nearly barren , as in Arabia and Mongolia . Some of the largest plateaus are arid or semiarid ; the great desert belt , which includes central and southwestern Asia and the Sahara , is a belt of arid plateaus . In such an environment life is hard . Nomadic tribes , with flocks and herds , move from place to place in search of grass and water . Settled homes are the exception ; law and government are weak , and robbery and raiding are common . It has been pointed out that in tropical lands , like Mexico and western South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places of residence and contain the major part of the population . The scarcity of rainfall , however , limits agriculture and prevents any very great advancement . Most plateaus have been uplifted as part of a mountain-building process and so are likely to have rich mineral veins . This is notably true in Mexico and South America , although it is not true of all plateaus ; for example , the Piedmont Plateau of our southern states . PLAINS Character . Some plains are very low and very level , while others have considerable elevation and are roiling or hilly . But // low elevation and a generally even surface are implied in the word plain . Coastal plains are stretches of low land , more or less sandy , on the coastal borders of continents . They are portions of the adjacent sea bottom which has been slightly uplifted and added to the land . Such a plain extends from New Jersey to Mexico along the Atlantic and Gulf coast of North America . Interior plains . ? The vast plains of Russia and Siberia and of central North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the sea . During their submergence , sand , clay , and other sediments were deposited in broad sheets . Later these were uplifted bodily and became parts of the con-tinents . It has been pointed out previously that mountains furnish most of the sediments of which such plains are made . // Interior plains and coastal plains make up a large part of Europe and of the two Americas . Alluvial plains , already discussed in connection with rivers , are made of the alluvium carried by streams , and deposited in deltas , flood plains , alluvial fans , etc . Such plains are commonly found along the lower courses of great rivers , e.g. , the Mississippi , the Nile , the Ganges , and the Yangtze ( Chapter IT ) . Glacial plains are those made by the deposits of continental glaciers , as in the upper Mississippi Valley and northern Europe . They are sometimes called till plains . Lake plains are due to silt deposited on the beds of lakes which no longer exist . Large plains of this kind are rare , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . One of the best examples is the rich plain of the Red River of the North , the bed of glacial Lake Agassiz . It is evident that alluvial , glacial , and lake plains may overlap or rest upon other kinds . For example , that of Lake Agassiz rests upon a glacial plain , which in turn is part of the great interior plain of North America . // Plains with Special Names . The prairies are the grasscovered plains of our Middle West . They were originally treeless , or else had trees only along the streams . Sometimes patches of prairie and of woodland were interspersed . There are similar grassy plains in various parts of the world called by special names , as , for example , llanos in Venezuela , and pampas in Argentina . The frozen , swampy plains of the Far North are called tundras , and dry plains such as those of southern Siberia and Russia are called steppes ; not all steppes , however , are plains . Plains in Different Climates . The frozen plains of northern Siberia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . They yield him furs , but little else , and few people live there ; these are the cold plains . In Australia , the Sahara , Patagonia , and Russian Turkestan there are desert plains ; in Brazil the vast plain of the Amazon is a tropical jungle , so moist , hot , and unhealthful that white men can not long remain there . But the well-watered plains of the temperate zone , with their deep soil , invigorating climate , and ease of travel , are regions of great productiveness . Here the chief food crops grow ; here roads and railways may readily unite every part of the plain with every other , and facilitate the exchange of products . The ease of travel leads to the exchange of ideas and this promotes progress . Such plains are the ones referred to in the following contrasts . PLAINS AND MANKIND Mountains and Plains Contrasted. ? ( 1 ) Mountains have a great variety of climate in relatively small areas , while plains are likely to have a uniformity of climate over a large area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small areas , while plains cause the rainfall to be distributed widely . ( 3 ) Mountain streams are torrential and erode the land rapidly , while streams on the plains are sluggish and often deposit rather than erode . ( 4 ) Mountains retard the movements of people and of armies , and hinder the building of railroads , roads , and canals , while plains encourage such undertakings . // ( 5 ) Mountains tend to isolate their inhabitants and keep them secluded and unprogressive , while plains lead to constant intermingling of people and to that exchange of ideas which causes progress . ( 6 ) Mountains are favorable to the preservation of forests , while plains favor their removal to make way for agriculture . ( 7 ) Mountainous regions are likely to be cut up into small nations , as in western and southern Europe , while great plains are favorable to the growth of large nations , of which Russia is a notable example . ( 8 ) Plains are suited to the growing of the great food crops , and can support a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small population . s umm:kR Plateaus are large areas of considerable elevation which rise steeply above the adjacent land on one or more sides . High plateaus are likely to be deeply cut by gorges , to be and or semiarid , and hence lacking in population . The smaller and lower plateaus , of which the Allegheny Plateau is an example , may have abundant rainfall and be well forested . The great plateaus are nearly all surmounted by higher mountain ranges to which the aridity is in part due . Plains are of various origins : They may be portions of the sea bottom , uplifted and added to the continent as coastal or interior plains ; they may be due to deposits of rivers ( alluvial plains ) , or of glaciers ( glacial plains ) , or of lakes ( lake plains ) . Where the temperature and rainfall are favorable , plains are the ideal places for man 's activities . Their level surface makes agriculture attractive , and makes the exchange of products and of ideas convenient ; plains oppose clannishness and promote unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of large nations and to the spread of civilization ; but they are easy to invade and difficult to defend . They are the regions from which the world 's supply of food must mainly be drawn ? Russia , Argentina , // central North America , and the smaller plains of Hungary , Germany , France , and India . The earth 's interior has undergone a contracting or shrinking process which has forced parts of the crust upward to form plateaus and mountains , and has caused other portions to sink and form ocean basins . These movements of the crust produce breaks or fractures which are favorable to general volcanic activity . The main mountain systems form the skeletons of the continents and largely determine their shape . By weathering and erosion , mountains are sculptured into ridges , peaks , domes , passes , gaps , etc . But as they grow old their tall peaks , precipitous cliffs , and sharp angles change to rounded summits , gentler slopes , and slowly decreasing altitude . CONDENSED SUMMARY OF THE INFLUENCE OF MOUNTAINS The influence which mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most positive and easily discernible of geographic influences . Mountains whose general elevation is low or whose passes are low exert only a moderate influence . In estimating the influence of mountains upon a country , consider what the conditions would be if the mountain area were a plain . 1 . The climate of a mountain belt is made colder by its elevation . One mile upward equals 800 miles poleward . The tropical Andean countries can produce practically all crops . 2 . High mountains force the passing winds to precipitate their moisture on the windward slope , producing and or desert lands on the leeward side . Our western mountains render 500,000,000 acres unfit for agriculture . 3 . The gradual melting of mountain glaciers equalizes the seasonal flow of rivers , thus reducing floods and aiding navigation and irrigation . 4 . Excessive weathering and erosion in mountains often overloads a stream to the detriment of navigation , as in the Missouri , or to the benefit of alluvial plains , as in the Nile . // Mountains supply most of the sediments of which the plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crust and the circulation of mineral-carrying waters result from mountain building . Hence mountains are the natural home of metallic veins and of mining . The relative inaccessibility of mountains tends toward the preservation of their forests , thus conserving the timber supply , and regulating the run-off . Mountains discourage agriculture , but their lower slopes favor grazing , e.g. , in the Rockies and the Alps . The rigorous climate , scanty soil , difficulties of travel , and . restricted industries of mountains attract but a scanty population . About the same number of people live in ten mountain states of the West as live in New York City alone . Mountains are often effective barriers to the intercourse of people , to the spread of population , to military campaigns , and to the building of roads and railways . They are nature 's boundary lines for nations . Mountains form a retreat for vanquished races ; they isolate and preserve past languages , customs , laws , and ideas . The isolation of mountain life accentuates nonsocial qualities , as seen in the clannishness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insubordination of the Basques and the tribes of the Caucasus , the Tibetan 's dislike of strangers , the lawlessness in the Balkans , and the suspiciousness and family feuds among our southern mountaineers. // CHAPTER XIII THE ATMOSPHERE The atmosphere is part of the earth , not merely an envelope surrounding it . The atmosphere rotates with the rest of the earth and travels with it around the sun . Light as it is , the air has weight and is held by the attraction of gravity . Thirteen cubic feet of ordinary air weigh about a pound . Composition . ? Moist air rarely contains more than one or two per cent of water vapor . The following table shows the average composition of dry air : 250 Function of the Different Farts . ? Oxygen is the active g ; a , s of the air ; life is impossible without it . So delicately are we adjusted to the proportion of oxygen in the air that a small reduction in the amount makes us drowsy and a large reduction may cause death . Review what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inert or inactive . So far as animal life is concerned its chief function seems to be to dilute the oxygen . Plants require nitrogen , but they do not get it directly from the air . As explained earlier , certain plants ( particularly members of the clover family ) are able to store it in usable form in nodules formed by soil bacteria on the roots . Argon is much like nitrogen , and is not known to serve any important purpose i a the atmosphere . // Carbon dioxide ( composed of carbon and oxygen ) is exhaled in the breath of people and animals , and is one of the gases given off when things burn or decay . Every ton of coal that is burned pours into the air nearly three tons of carbon dioxide . Plants are able to take the carbon from the carbon dioxide of the air and to use it in building up their tissues , while the oxygen is ( in the presence of sunlight ) returned to the air . Water vapor is of great importance , particularly because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life on the land . It gives rise to clouds , dew , snow , fog , and hail ; its presence makes the atmosphere a better blanket to protect us from the intense heat of the sun during the day and to prevent the rapid escape of heat from the earth at night . Dust in the atmosphere varies greatly in amount at different times and in different places . Dust and bacteria are from 10 to 20 times as abundant in the air of cities as in that of the open country . Depth of the Atmosphere .  --  There is no way of knowing how far the air extends upward beyond the lithosphere , but it is at least 300 miles , and probably more . However , at a height of 10 miles the air is too thin to support human life , and at 50 miles ( where it is thought to be nearly all hydrogen ) it must be extremely thin or rare . At its outer margin the atmosphere must , blend so gradually with empty space that no boundary between them could possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air has weight , it presses down upon the surface of the land and sea ; this pressure is about 15 pounds upon each square inch , or about one ton on each square foot at sea level . Since the lower air supports the weight of all the air above it , this lower portion of the air is compressed . So great is this compression that the lower air , extending up to an elevation of 3.6 miles , contains one half of the total atmosphere by weight . In other words , if we ascend a mountain 3.6 miles above the sea , we shall have half of the atmosphere below and half above our level . So rare is the atmosphere on the highest mountain tops that men can not keep alive there . Mt . Everest and others of the high peaks of the Himalayas have never been scaled . // Explorers can not sleep at these high altitudes , and in this rare atmosphere they find the exertion of climbing so great that they can scarcely lift one foot above the other . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moisture , we think the air is heavy , while on a clear , cool day it seems light ; but just the opposite is true . Water vapor is lighter than air and when freely mixed with the at-mosphere , makes the latter less heavy . The barometer is an instrument for meas uring the pressure or weight of the atmos phere . The essential parts of a barometer are a glass tube about 32 inches in length , closed at one end and open at the other , and a cup of mercury . The glass tube is filled with mercury , and is then stood upright with the open end in the cup ( Fig. 183 ) . The mercury in the tube will sink a little until it stands about 30 inches higher than the sur-face of the mercury in the cup , while the upper ( closed ) portion of the tube above the mercury will be entirely empty ; that is , it will be a vacuum . The ordinary barometer differs from this only in details ( Fig. 184 ) . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches and fractions of an inch , so that an observer may tell at a glance " how high the barometer stands . " i The Principle of the Barometer . Mercury is used in the barometer because it is the heaviest liquid , and does not freeze at ordinary winter temperatures . The principle of the barometer would be the same if any other liquid were used . Water might be employed ( in warm weather ) , but in that case the glass tube must be about 34 feet long . Since the atmosphere exerts a pressure of about 15 pounds to the square inch , it is evident that the downward // pressure upon the mercury in the cup is 15 pounds on each square inch , and this downward pressure of the air balances a column of mercury about 30 inches high ( equal to a column of water about 34 feet high ) in the tube of the barometer . If , for any reason , the pressure of the air upon the mercury in the cup changes , the mercury in the tube rises or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminishes one thirtieth , the mercury in the tube sinks one thirtieth . Thus , by means of the barometer , we can measure changes in the pressure or weight of the atmosphere . The word barometer means pressure measure , just as thermometer means heat measure . Uses of the Barometer . If we ascend a moun tain , carrying such a barometer with us , we shall find that the mercury in the glass tube gradually sinks as we go higher up the mountain . In this way the alti tudes of places can be measured ; for this purpose the aneroid barometer is convenient . Important changes in the weather are preceded , accompanied , and followed by changes in atmospheric pressure . The laws governing these changes are so well understood that the weather can be partially fore-told by the action of the barometer . All weather predictions sent out by the U. S. Weather Bureau stations are based upon observations of the barometer made at many stations and telegraphed daily to other stations . Isobars are lines drawn on a map connecting places of equal atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How the Atmosphere Is Warmed . ? The sun is the source of practically all of our heat . It sends out or radiates waves of energy which travel outward from // the sun in all directions through space , and a minute fraction ( one two-bill.ionth ) is received by the earth . The waves of energy , usually called rays , pass through space and enter our atmosphere ; some of their heat is absorbed directly by the air , but the larger part of it passes through the air and is absorbed by the land and water . During the night some of this heat is radiated back into the atmosphere and much of it escapes into outer space . Heat is also constantly radiated back into the air from the earth during the day . While the air absorbs some heat directly from the sun 's rays , it is warmed still more by the waves which are radiated back from the earth . The Air as a Blanket . Clear air permits heat waves to pass through it readily , but clouds and even invisible moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket which tempers the heat of the sun during the day and checks the rapid escape of heat from the earth at night . This benefits roan in important ways . It is estimated that the temperature of the land would fall at night to 320 ? below zero F. if there were no atmosphere . It is believed that on the moon , where there is no atmosphere , the temperature rises far above the boiling point of water during the moon 's day and falls more than a hundred degrees below zero during its night . The heat of day and the cold of night on the earth would be much more extreme if our atmosphere were thinner or contained less moisture and carbon dioxide . Convection . Warming the air causes it to expand and thus to become lighter , and being lighter , it tends to rise . This tendency of warm air to rise and cool air to sink causes a circulation called convection . A similar circulation is started when a dish of water or body of water is heated . Convection currents both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributing heat . By means of these convection currents , including the winds , warm air and cool air are being continually mixed , usually to the comfort and benefit of man . Day and Night Temperatures . ? As a rule , the coldest part of the night is shortly before sunrise , for the dark part of the earth has received no heat since sunset and has been radiating heat all . // night . At sunrise this part of the earth begins to receive and absorb heat , and continues to absorb it during the forenoon and until about 2 P.M. in winter , and 3 P.M. in summet , when the warmest part of the day is reached . The earth is then radiating heat back into the air with the greatest intensity of the day ; after that time ( 2 to 3 P.M. ) , the temperature grows cooler . Thus the hottest part of the day lags behind the noon hour ; and for a similar reason the hottest part of summer lags behind the summer solstice ( June 21 ) . WATER III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never absolutely dry , but the amount of water vapor which it contains varies from day to day and from place to place . Water vapor itself is invisible , but when it is cooled sufficiently the vapor condenses into droplets or drops of 2vater and these are visible . Condensation is the change of invisible water vapor to visible water , due to cooling . Evaporation . At ordinary temperatures water is a liquid . When the temperature is raised to 212 ? F. , water boils ( at sea level ) and passes into steam or vapor . It also passes slowly into vapor at temperatures much below 212 ? F. Everybody knows that clothes dry on the line , that mud " dries up , " and that pools of water evaporate in the sun and wind . Evaporation is the process by which water becomes vapor and passes into the air . Humidity . ? On a sultry day in summer , the air is spoken of as being very humid , or moist . A cubic , yard of air at 80 ? F. can hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can hold less , and at 90 ? more . In an ordinary-sized schoolroom , say 20 feet square and 15 feet high , at 70 ? F. the air can hold about G pounds of water vapor . The actual amount of vapor which a certain body of air holds is called its absolute humidity . This is usually measured in grains per cubic foot ; for example , 10 grains of water vapor per cubic foot of air . Air which contains 75 per cent of the water vapor that it is capable of holding at that temperature is said to have a relative humidity of 75 per cent . Relative humidity is , therefore , the percentage // which the amount of water actually in the air forms of the amount which the air could hold at that temperature . Saturation . ? The warmer the air , the more moisture it can hold . When air contains all the moisture it can hold at that temperature , it is said to be saturated . So long as the air is not saturated , its moisture remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of the hater vapor condenses and becomes visible in the form of clouds , mist , fog , rain , snow , or dew . The dew point is the temperature at which air becomes satu-rated , that is , reaches the point where it contains all the moisture that it can hold . If the air becomes any cooler , some of the water vapor in it will condense . If we breathe upon a cold pane of glass , for example , the breath is quickly cooled below the dew point , part of the moisture in the breath condenses and forms a film of water on the glass . If the glass were as warm as the breath , no such film would form . The ice pitcher or ice-water tank cools // below the dew point the air that touches it , and the water vapor in the air is condensed on the outside of the pitcher or tank . It will be seen that the dew point is not a fixed temperature , but is variable . If the air is hot and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say at W or 85 ' F. , but if the air is relatively dry it will need to be cooled many degrees before the point of saturation ( dew point ) is reached , perhaps to 35 ' or 40 ? F. CLOUDS Cause of Clouds . ? The upper air is , as a rule , cooler than that near the earth . Upward-moving currents of air expand and are thereby cooled , and the moisture is condensed into tiny droplets which become visible , yet are light enough to float in the air . This visible water vapor , floating at high altitudes , forms clouds . They are easily blown before the wind , constantly changing their shape , and often dissolving under the warming , influence of the sun or in warm air currents . Kinds of Clouds . ? Clouds are classified into four principal types : ( 1 ) Fleecy white clouds at very high altitudes are called cirrus , meaning hairlike ; they are 8 or 10 miles high and consist of tiny crystals of frozen mist ( Fig. 185 ) . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly horizontal bands or layers one above the other . They are seldom more than a mile or two above the earth and often cover a considerable part of the sky ( Fig. 186 ) . ( 3 ) Cumulus clouds are the great heaps of cloud which look much like piles of fluffy cotton or wool . They often form quickly on a summer 's day , assuming picturesque shapes and taking on rich colors at sunset ( Fig. 187 ) . ( 4 ) Nimbus clouds are the rain clouds . They are dense and dark and threatening . They are usually only a mile or two high and do not last long . Colors of the Clouds . ? Even the blackest clouds are bright and shining on the side toward the sun . " The darkest cloud has a silver lining . " The dark clouds are black only because they are too dense for the sun to shine through . Other clouds are white because the sunlight passes through them , and the rays are scattered or diffused , as they are in passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sunset are due to the action of the atmospheric vapor and dust upon the rays of the sun . Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow , and when beams of sunlight pass through the cloud particles at certain angles , the rays of light are separated into their various colors and give us the beautiful hues of the sunset . Fog is really cloud stuff floating near the surface of the land or water . It is formed when moist air is cooled . Near Newfoundland the warm Gulf Stream and the cold Labrador current come close together ; the warm air over the Gulf Stream is mixed with the cold air over the . Labrador current and great banks of fog are produced . Dust particles and smoke particles form tiny centers upon which moisture condenses and produces fog . The London fogs are believed to be in part due to this cause . Dew and Frost . ? The dew does not " fall " ; after sunset , in summer , the ground cools rapidly and soon the grass and shrubs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches them , and the moisture which they themselves exhale . The thin leaves of the grass and plants not only exhale moisture , but they also expose much surface to the air , and cool quickly , and so are the first objects to become wet with dew . Wood is a // poor conductor of heat and therefore cools slowly . A b lard sidewalk may collect no dew when the grass on either side is dripping wet . Iron and other metals are good conductors of heat ; they cool rapidly and often collect dew early in the evening . The moisture that collects on the outside of a glass of ice water is actual dew ; so also is the moisture which collects on the window pane . The white frost that appears on objects on cool autumn morn ings is frozen vapor which would have ap-peared as dew if the temperature had not been at 32 ? F. or lower . Rain is due to the rapid condensation of water vapor in the up-per air . We do not expect " rain from a cloudless sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vapor and rain . The warm air of summer is able to hold a large amount of water vapor . When this warm , moist air rises and cools , clouds form ; and if condensation proceeds far enough , the tiny droplets unite , form into drops , and rain follows . Rainfall and snowfall are often re ferred to as precipitation . Snow is not frozen rain ; it is frozen vapor . Snowflakes form directly from water vapor without passing through the liquid state . Strangely enough , perfect snowflakes ( which are ice crystals ) always have six points or six angles . Many thousands of snow-flakes have been photographed , and they are always hexagonal ( Fig. 189 ) . // Hail is less common than rain because hail can form only under unusual conditions . If a large hailstone is cut in two , it is found to be made up of a snowy center inclosed by several shells of ice , like the formation of an onion ( Fig. 190 ) . Large hailstones form only when the upper air is in violent commotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward-moving air current , carried up , then falls toward the earth , and is again caught in a rising current and carried upward , thus traversing alternately cool and warm layers of air and adding film after film of ice . In rare cases , hailstones as large as small eggs are formed . Hailstorms are often destructive to growing crops and many farmers carry hail insurance . THE MAIN FACTS ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE SUMMARIZED The atmosphere is as much a part of the earth as is the land or the water . It consists of a mixture of about 78 per cent nitrpgen. // 21 per cent oxygen , and small amounts of argon , carbon dioxide , water vapor , and dust . Oxygen is the active , life-giving element of the air ; it aids decay and causes combustion . Nitrogen dilutes the oxygen ; it is required by plants , but they can not take it directly out of the air ; carbon dioxide is also essential to plants , and is taken directly from the air ; water vapor supplies dew , snow , fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the lower air is so compressed by the weight of the air above it , that one half of all the air , by weight , forms a bottom " layer " only 3.6 miles deep . The high atmosphere is very thin or rare . At sea level the atmospheric pressure , due to the weight of the air , is about 15 pounds to the square inch or one ton to the square foot . The barometer measures atmospheric pressure ; it is used for measuring elevations and is also one of the principal instruments used by weather forecasters . The air is warmed by the sun 's rays as they pass through it , but it is warmed still more by the heat radiated back by the land and water . The atmosphere acts as a blanket inclosing the rest of the earth and protecting it from the intense rays of the sun by day , and checking the rapid loss of heat from the earth at night . The warmer the air , the more water vapor it can contain . The air is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can hold at . that temperature . If air is cooled , its capacity for holding water is diminished , and when the point of saturation ( the dew point ) is reached , the invisible vapor condenses into fog , cloud , rain , dew , etc . Frost , snow , and hail are formed when the temperature is at or below the freezing point , 32 ? F. Clouds are bodies of condensed vapor floating in the upper air . Their height varies all the way from less than one mile to 8 or 10 miles ; the highest clouds are fluffy crystals or frozen mist . Fog is cloud stuff at a low elevation . Dew collects mainly on grass and other low vegetation , partly because they lose their heat quickly in the evening and partly because vegetation itself exhales moisture . The film of moisture that often collects on // cold glass or metals is condensed from the air which comes in con-tact with these objects . Rain is due to the rapid cooling of ascend ing air and the resulting condensation of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. or lower , the vapor turns directly to snow . Hail is frozen rain , formed under somewhat unusual conditions . // CHAPTER XIV WINDS AND STORMS How Differences of Temperature Cause the Movement of Air . ? If an outside door of a house is opened on a cold day , there is an outflow of warm air at the top of the doorway and an inflow of cold air at the bottom . ( Test this . ) The inflowing cold air is heavier than the air of the room and pushes it up and out . A stove in a room warms the air near it , causing it to expand and so to become lighter ; the cooler air flows in toward the stove , becomes 265 // warmed , and in turn rises , thus setting up convection currents , and the circulation causes the entire room to become warm ( Fig. 191 ) . Relation of Temperature and Pressure to Wind . ? Since cold air is heavier than warm , a region of cool or cold air is one of greater air pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less air pressure , or low pressure . Toward such a region the heavier air on any side flows , causing winds . It is a basic principle that air moves toward regions of low pressure and away from regions of high pressure . How Winds Are Named . ? A north wind is one that blows from the north ; a southeast wind is one that blows from the southeast , etc . Winds are named according to the direction they blow from . The Cause of Wind Temperatures . ? The air over a warm body of water or land absorbs heat from it and becomes warmer . Air over a cold body of water or land imparts heat to it , and itself becomes cooler . Thus , in either case , the air tends to take on a temperature similar to that of the land or water upon which it rests . Air is capable of holding and carrying a large amount of heat ; it parts with this heat gradually as it blows over a cool region , or absorbs heat gradually as it blows over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring heat which they previously absorbed ; and winds from the north take up heat as they pass , making the region cooler . Air Drainage . ? On summer nights the cool air of the hills flows down the hillsides into the valleys , and forces the warm air in the valleys to rise . Thus the low ground gets the cool air and may have frost , while the higher ground gets the lighter warm air and may escape frost . This principle of air drainage is important to fruit growers . Orchards and vineyards are usually safer on the slopes of hills or even on the summits , if not too high , than in the valley bottoms . Land and Sea Breezes . ? Land warms and cools more rapidly than water . During a summer day the land along the coast becomes warmer than the adjacent ocean , and the cooler air from the sea flows in , giving a cool , refreshing sea breeze . At night the land cools more rapidly than the sea , and soon after sunset the air over the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows out to // sea , giving a land breeze . The land breeze continues until after sunrise , when a reversal gradually takes place . Such breezes affect the land only a short distance ( seldom more than 10 or 15 miles ) back from the shore . Similar breezes , though not so well de veloped , occur near lakes . These cooling breezes are one of the attractions which draw people to the seashore and to lake shores in summer . The Monsoons . ? These are land and sea breezes on a large scale ; they shift with the change of the seasons instead of with the change of night and day . Mon soons exist in many parts of the world but they are most per fectly developed in southern and south-eastern Asia , includ-ing India , Indo-China , and part of China , and the adjacent ocean . In our summer when the sun is north of the equator , the land of Asia becomes warmer than the sea , and an ocean wind sets in from a general southerly direction , carrying // much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impor tance in India , where the summer or wet monsoon begins in June and continues until September . In our winter when the sun moves south of the equator , central Asia becomes colder than the Indian Ocean and for about three or four months the monsoon blows from the land to the sea . Between the summer and winter monsoons are periods when the winds are shifty and uncertain . Importance to India . ? So important to India is the rainfall of the summer monsoon that its failure brings almost complete ruin to crops , and at various times millions of the people of the afflicted regions have starved to death . Sometimes the famines are so wide-spread and severe that famine relief has to be given to millions of the population for periods varying from one to four years . For example , the famine of 1896-97 in India affected an area of about 225,000 square miles , with a population of 62,000,000 people , and the government had to expend millions of dollars in the direct relief of distress . An idea of the frequency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last three decades of the nineteenth century , no less than four severe famines devastated parts of the country . // The Heat Equator and Its Seasonal Movement . ? Some part of the torrid zone is always receiving the sun 's vertical rays . Owing to the inclination of the earth 's axis and to the annual revolution of the earth , the sun 's apparent path seems to shift its position grad ually from north of the equator to south of it and back again . In // our summer the sun 's vertical rays fall upon the northern half of the torrid zone , and in our winter they fall upon the southern half . The heat equator , or line of greatest heat , is therefore nearly always entirely within the torrid zone . Since the great land masses ( continents ) are mainly in the northern hemisphere , this hemisphere becomes somewhat hotter in the northern summer than does the southern hemisphere during its summer . This causes the heat equator , which shifts north and south with the sun , to be more largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 194 and 195 ) . In summer the land becomes hotter than the ocean and the heat equator bends farther north over the continents than over the oceans in the northern hemisphere , and farther south in the southern hemi sphere during our winter . The Doldrums or Region of Equatorial Calms . ? Since the heat equator is in the middle of a belt of high temperature and low pressure , the air is constantly rising . This belt of rising air , known as the doldrums or equatorial calms , is a few degrees in width and is practically always north of the equator ; it is well defined only over the sea . In it sailing ships have sometimes been becalmed for days or even weeks . The constantly rising and cooling air gives a heavy rainfall , and a sultry , unhealthful climate . // The Trade Winds . ? These are winds which , on the sea , blow rather steadily toward the heat equator from both sides , supplying the air that is constantly rising in the doldrums . If the earth did not rotate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north and south , but the rotation causes the trade winds to blow from the northeast and the southeast , hence they are called the northeast trades and the southeast trades . Their steadiness led sailing vessels to make use of them , and this may have given rise to their name . The trade winds , of course , migrate alternately north and south with the change of seasons . They bring rainfall when they blow from sea to highlands , as they do in northern South America and Central America ; they are drying winds causing deserts when they blow over the land as they do in Arabia and the Sahara . The Horse Latitudes . The air which rises in the doldrums precipitates most of its moisture in rising ; at a considerable height the air spreads out and flows both northward and southward as upper currents , called the anti-trade winds , because they blow in a direction opposite to the trades . This air , which has become cooled and hence heavier , begins to sink toward the earth when it reaches latitudes of 30 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is sinking and hence coming under greater pressure , it becomes warmer , and having previously lost most of its moisture , the air is // in condition to absorb moisture , not to precipitate it . These regions of settling air near the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn are called the horse latitudes . They migrate north and south with the seasons , as do the trades and doldrums , and are always dry or nearly so . They therefore bring the " dry season " to lands which they visit in their seasonal movements northward and southward . The Prevailing Westerlies . ? Not all of the air of the antitrades settles to the earth in the horse latitude belt ; much continues to move farther toward the poles , settling as it progresses . The earth 's rotation causes this air to swerve toward the right in the northern hemisphere and toward the left in the southern , giving rise to the wide belt of east-moving wind known in both hemispheres as the belt of prevailing westerlies . This belt covers most of the two temperate zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great nations of the earth . While the prevailing winds of this belt are from the westerly quarter , yet , as we know by experience , they are very changeable . The cause of this changeableness is discussed later . THE WIND BELTS SUMMARIZED The heat equator is a line or narrow belt connecting places of highest heat . The doldrums are a region of calms and high temperature covering an irregular area a few degrees on each side of the heat equator where the air rises and precipitates its moisture in heavy rains . The air which constantly flows in from the northeast and the southeast to displace the lighter air of the doldrums forms the trade winds . These may bring rainfall when they blow from the ocean to the land , but otherwise they are drying winds and are an important cause of the great deserts , as the Sahara , for example . Their steadiness on the sea favored sailing vessels and possibly led to the name , trade winds . The doldrums and the trades prevail in the torrid zone . The anti-trades are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in part , settling near the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn . These belts of sinking air are regions of relative calm and dryness and are known as the horse latitudes . The heat equator , the doldrums // and trades , and the horse latitudes all migrate a little northward in our summer and southward in our winter , due to the same causes that produce the change of seasons , namely , the revolution of the earth around the sun and the fixed inclination of its axis . The winds of the temperate and frigid zones form two great circumpolar whirls , moving in an easterly direction in both the northern and the southern hemispheres . The prevailing westerlies give the kind of climate which is most favorable to mental and bodily vigor ; therefore , regions with this climate have the highest civilization . STORMS AND WEATHER CHANGES Frequent Changes of Weather . ? Most of the people living in the United States are accustomed to frequent changes of weather . The wind sometimes changes its direction several times during a clay , and the thermometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A day may begin with clear skies and bright sun-shine , and in the course of a few hours clouds may gather , rain pour down in torrents , and the sky again be clear before evening . The // causes of these changes will be discussed in the following paragraphs . Regions of High and Low Pressure . ? People sometimes say " as fickle as the weather , " implying that the weather changes its mood rapidly and with little cause . Of course every such change has a cause . Practically all these rapid changes are connected with changes of atmospheric pressure . If at this moment you were to receive telegraphic messages from places widely scattered over the United States , and these messages told the height of the mercury in the barometer , you would find that the atmospheric pressure differs at different places quite irrespective of altitude . In regions of low pressure the air is rising , and in regions of high pressure it is sinking . Wherever the air is warmer and lighter than that around it , it rises or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascending air expands and cools and may give rain or snow . Descending air is likely to be cool and relatively dry . A large region of ascending air ( low pressure ) is called a low , and a large // region of descending air ( high pressure ) is a high . Such regions of high or low pressure are of very large extent , covering thousands of square miles . Movements of the Air in a Cyclone . ? A low is spoken of as a storm . The air which flows toward such a center does not move straight in , but , like other winds in the northern hemisphere , it is deflected toward the right by the earth 's rotation . This causes the inflowing and ascending air to have a circular or spiral movement , as shown in Figs. 196 and 197 . Such areas of inflowing and rising air are called cyclones or cyclonic storms . They occur in the belt of prevailing westerly winds and so are carried along with the prevailing wind toward the east or northeast . Anticyclones or Highs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must somewhere descend to replace it . Areas of descending air are indicated by a high barometer , signifying high atmospheric pressure . Such regions are called anticyclones . Like the cyclones , they travel from west to east with the prevailing westerlies . They usually bring clear and cooler weather . The rate of movement of highs and lows is exceedingly variable . Sometimes they move a third of the way across the United States in 24 hours , and again a high or a low may be nearly stationary for some time ( Fig. 198 ) . Storm Tracks across the United States . Most of the cyclonic storms come from the northwest or southwest , cross the United States , and pass out over the Atlantic near the Gulf of St. Lawrence . So many of these storms follow certain quite definite paths that maps showing storm tracks may be made . In Fig. 199 the width of any black line is in proportion to the frequency of storm movements along that path . Influence of the Passing of Highs and Lows upon the Weather . ? Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing of highs and lows . Since the wind blows in toward low-pressure centers , and out from high-pressure centers , and since both of these are carried across the country in the westerlies , it is clear that much changing of wind direction must be caused . If a low is passing north of a place , say Chicago , the wind in the region of // Chicago moves toward the low , that is , moves from the south toward the north ; this gives Chicago a warm wind from the southeast , south , or southwest . If the low passes south of the city , the wind will be from a northerly quarter and will be cool or cold . As a low approaches a place from the west , the wind , blowing toward it , comes from the easterly quarter . When the storm center has passed , the wind , blowing toward it , comes from the westerly quarter . The low-pressure area ( rising air ) is usually accompanied by rain ( or snow ) , while the high-pressure area of descending air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be bitterly cold . The area directly influenced by one of these highs or lows may be a thousand miles across , covering a third of the United States . A large part of the rainfall of the Mississippi basin is brought from // the Gulf of Mexico by winds moving toward low-pressure areas in the northern states . Thunder Storms . ? These are most common when the weather is hot . In our latitude they occur most frequently on hot summer afternoons . During the day the ground and the air above it become very warm ; the air rises rapidly , expands , cools , and its moisture condenses ; great heaps of cumulo-nimbus clouds quickly gather and rain falls , usually in a vigorous shower . Lightning is an electric charge leaping from one cloud to another or from a cloud to the earth ( Fig. 201 ) . Each tiny drop of water in the air carries a little charge of electricity . When clouds gather very rapidly , as they do before the breaking of a thunder storm , many of these tiny drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine , causing every droplet in the cloud to be highly charged ; hence the cloud itself becomes highly charged with // electricity . It discharges violently by the lightning , and quietly by the fall of the raindrops . So-called heat lightning does not differ from other lightning . It simply is occurring so far away that we see its reflection in the clouds , but do not hear the thunder . Thunder is due to intense vibrations in the air set up by the lightning . The passing of the electric charge which we call lightning disturbs the air , sets it in vibration , and sound is produced . If the discharge of electricity is very near the observer , the crash of thunder instantly follows the lightning flash . Such discharges are to be feared . If the discharge is a few miles from the observer , the thunder is not heard for some seconds and then comes with a rolling sound , echoing from cloud to cloud . Tornadoes , though frequently miscalled cyclones , are quite different . Cyclones cover a great area , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are constantly passing over the United States . Tornadoes are small areas of exceptionally low pressure accompanied by rapidly rising and violently whirling air . They are often only a few rods broad ; at the center there is usually a funnel-shaped , whirling , black cloud , within which the pressure is very low indeed . So violent is the wind and so low the pressure in this cloud that trees are uprooted , buildings are torn to pieces , and people killed . Usually tornadoes are attended by lightning , by a most violent downpour of rain , and often by hail . SUMMARY OF STORMS AND WEATHER The rapid and frequent changes of weather in most parts of the United States are mainly due to the passing of low-pressure areas , called cyclones . These lows are near the center of slowly rising and rotating bodies of air of wide extent ; they move in a general west-to-east direction , like great eddies in the prevailing westerly winds . Most of them enter North America from the Pacific and the larger number of them follow tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Lawrence Valley . The same storms , or similar ones , traverse the Atlantic and move on across Europe . // tl Areas of high pressure , or highs , usually follow the lows , each , as a rule , moving across the United States in three or four days . The cyclones , or lows , being areas of rising and cooling air , usually bring rain or snow . The anticyclones , or highs , being areas of descending air , are usually dry and cool in summer and cold in winter . The frequent passing of cyclonic storms across the United States causes in-drafts of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and these furnish most of the rainfall for the Mississippi Valley . Our Atlantic coast region receives rain from the Atlantic in a similar manner . The passing of successive highs and lows causes rapid changes of the wind , cold and warm waves , wet and dry spells , and a gen eral uncertainty of weather . Tornadoes are much smaller than cyclones , much less frequent and , unlike cyclones , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INFLUENCE Climate and Weather . The weather of a place may change several times in a day ; the climate , however , is the average of weather conditions over a long period . A dry climate may have times of wet weather , and a climate classed as cool may have periods of very hot weather . Climate is the average of weather . Changes of climate take place , but such changes are too gradual to be detected except over very long periods . For example , the climate of North America was colder in the ice age than it is now , and it was warmer in the coal-forming periods ; fossils of tropical palms are found in icy Greenland , and glacial deposits in tropical Africa . An essential quality of climate , however , is its permanence or unchangeableness through long periods of time . Elements Which Make Up the Climate of a Place . ? The most important of these are ( a ) temperature , ( b ) moisture , and ( c ) winds . The average temperature of a place depends mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its altitude , ( 3 ) its nearness to the sea , and ( 4 ) the direction of the prevailing winds . The moisture of the air supplies rainfall , a fundamental requirement for all life . The winds are the great carriers of heat and moisture and so they directly affect the temperature and rainfall . How the Earth Is Warmed . ? Practically all of the heat which warms the earth comes from the sun . The waves of energy sent out by the sun traverse space without either warming or lighting it . Though the space between the earth and sun is always filled with waves which carry both heat and light , yet this space is as dark as night and intensely cold . When , however , any of these waves that are radiated from the sun strike an object , say the earth or even grains of dust or droplets of water in the air , these objects are warmed and illumined. 283 // Go out on a clear night before the moon has risen , and look out into space ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . It is hard to believe that this dark space is completely filled with waves from the sun , capable of producing light , yet such is the case . Later , the moon rises into the space which seemed so dark , and behold the face of the moon shines brilliantly . But what causes it to shine ? It shines by reflecting light received from the sun . If there were hundreds of moons scattered through this dark sky , they would all be shining by reflecting the sun 's light . Clearly , then , this space which appears dark to us is filled with waves that produce light . Although the moon changes in position every hour of the night and every night of the year , it never ( except when the earth comes between it and the sun , causing an eclipse of the moon ) gets out of reach of the sun 's rays , simply because all space surrounding the sun is filled with the waves or rays radiated from it . When these waves are traveling through space they manifest neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , the object is illumined and itself sends out waves of actual light by reflection . If light enters a darkened room through a small hole or crack , the dust particles in the air show exactly the path of the rays of light . If there were no dust in the room , the pencil of light would not be noted . Effect of Oblique and of Vertical Rays . Latitude and Temperature . ? The reason that the poles are colder than the equatorial regions is not that they are farther from the sun , for this small difference in distance is of little account . The temperatures in the polar regions are lower because of the earth 's spherical shape . So far away is the sun that those of its rays which strike the earth act substantially as they would if they were moving in parallel lines . If other conditions are the same , the amount of heat received by a square mile of the earth 's surface depends upon the number of sun 's rays ( or waves ) which strike it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another square mile receives them obliquely , the former receives more rays than // the latter . A point on the equator receives on an average dur-ing a year nearly three times as much heat as the pole receives . In Fig. 202 , the lines AB , AC , and BC are all of equal length ; BC , upon which the rays fall at right angles , receives the heat of 12 rays ; but AB , of the same length as BC , but on which the rays fall obliquely , receives only 6 rays , and hence only half as much heat . This explains , in part , why the frigid zones are cold . A second reason arises from the fac that rays which fall upon the equatorial region pass through less atmosphere ( DK in Fig. 203 ) than do the rays that fall upon the polar re-gions ( AM in Fig. 203 ) . The more at-mosphere the sun 's rays pass through , the more heat is absorbed from them before reaching the surface of the land or sea . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great amount of snow and ice has ac-cumulated there . When the sun does shine upon the frigid zones , its heat is used up merely in melting some of the snow and ice . The torrid zone is warmest because there the sun 's rays pass through the atmosphere by the shortest path , and because more rays strike each square mile of surface than in any other zone . Why We Have Winter When the Earth Is Nearest the Sun . ? It will be recalled that the earth 's orbit is a slightly flattened circle , or an ellipse , and that the sun is not at the center but at one of the foci ( F and F ' in Fig. 204 ) , a little on one side of the center : Recall that , as the earth journeys around the sun , its axis constantly // remains tilted at the same angle ( 232 ? ) , and in the same direction ( toward the pole star ) . As shown in Fig. 6 , page 12 , the northern hemisphere is tipped toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our winter , causing this hemisphere to receive much more heat in summer than in winter even though the earth is actually 22 million miles nearer the sun in winter . The people of the southern hemisphere have their summer when the earth is nearest the sun , and therefore would be expected to have warmer summers than we have . However , the great amount of ocean in the southern hemisphere so tempers the summer climate there that it is no warmer than ours . Effect of Altitude upon Climate . ? As previously explained , tem perature decreases one degree Fahrenheit on an average for each 330 feet of ascent , hence highlands are cooler than lowlands would be in the same location . Mountain ranges usually receive heavy rainfall on their windward slopes , but large plateaus are often dry // because the winds lose their moisture in rising to the level of the plateau , or in passing over the bordering mountains . Effect of Large Bodies of Water upon Climate . ? Even though the sun 's rays fall equally upon the land and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about four times as much heat to raise the temperature of water one degree as it does to raise the temperature of the same amount of land one degree . Thus , the continents and the air above them become much warmer in summer than do the oceans and the air over them . Water also gives up its heat more slowly than land . Therefore , the effect of large bodies of water is to produce a steadiness or equability of temperature between day and night and between summer and winter . Examples of Lake Influence . ? This influence of water bodies upon climate is well shown in the effect of the Great Lakes upon fruit growing . The prevailing westerly winds cause the lake influence to be felt mainly on the eastern side of the Lakes . Wisconsin , lying on the west side of Lake Michigan , raises very few grapes or peaches , but Michigan produces great quantities of both , especially in the counties near the lake ( Fig. 205 ) . The Chautauqua grape belt of New York is east of Lake Erie ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies near the shore of Lake Ontario ( Fig. 205 ) , and the fruit belt of Ontario , Canada , is in the peninsula which lies between Lakes Huron , Erie , and Ontario . Oceanic Climate . ? Oceanic islands have a remarkably uniform climate ; for example , the average temperature of the coldest month in Hawaii is only 2 or 3 degrees lower than that of the warmest month . In latitudes between 40 ? N. and 40 ? S. the average temperature of the air over the sea differs only 2 or 3 degrees between day and night . Coast lands are more uniform in temperature than interiors of continents . This is especially true of coasts which receive their prevailing winds from the sea , as is the case on our Pacific coast and on the Atlantic coast of Europe . Effect of Winds upon Climate . ? Winds are the great distributers of heat and moisture . They absorb heat in warm regions and carry it into cooler regions , and they convey cold air into warm latitudes . All summer long the oceans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , winds blowing over these ocean waters gradu-ally absorb the heat and carry it over the continents . Europe receives an enormous amount of heat from the westerly winds which blow over the North Atlantic . Southerly lands are often invaded by cold winds from the north ; for example , the orange groves of Florida were practically destroyed at one time by a " norther ) ) which brought a freezing temperature into that state . The winds are constantly engaged in mixing the atmos-phere , and this tends toward greater uni-formity of climate over the earth as a whole than would otherwise exist . From what has been said , it follows that the character of the prevailing winds ex-erts a powerful mflU-enee upon the climate of a place . If the pre-vailing winds are warm or cold , moist or dry , oceanic or continental , steady or fluctu-ating , the climate of the land over which they blow necessarily takes on a similar character . Effect of Ocean Currents upon Climate . ? Warm ocean cur-rents and " drifts , " such as the Gulf Stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a great amount of heat into cool latitudes ; this is taken up by winds that blow over them and the winds in turn warm the lands over which they blow . In a similar way , cold ocean currents invade warm latitudes , chill the winds , and cool the climate of the neighboring lands . It should be noted that , while ocean currents carry warm water or cold water , they have very // little direct effect upon the temperature of the lands ; their warming or cooling influence is exerted through the winds . Effect of Mountain Barriers on Climate . ? High mountain walls like the Alps and the Himalayas protect the lands south of them from cold north winds . Italy and India have milder climates in winter than they would have if they did not possess such efficient windbreaks on the north . The cities of northern India are from 10 to 15 degrees warmer in winter than those of China in the same latitude . The Central Plain of the United States has no such protection against north winds , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage to fruit and sensitive crops in our southern states . North and South Sides of Mountain Ranges . ? There is usually a marked difference between climatic conditions on the north side and on the south side of mountains in the temperate zone ; for example , the region lying north of the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia is subject to cold , bleak winds from the north , // and only hardy crops are grown . South of these mountains is a different world , for here subtropical fruits grow in profusion and in perfect safety . The effect of mountains on rainfall is still more marked ; for example , the west coast of Washington receives 140 inches of rainfall a year , while eastern Washington , on the lee side of the mountains , receives from 7 to 15 inches . Note also the effect of the Sierra Nevada Mountains as shown in Fig. 206 . This general topic has already been discussed . Isotherms are lines drawn on a map to connect places of equal temperature . For example , an isothermal map for July has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same average temperature during July ( Fig. 208 ) ; a map showing annual isotherms has a series of lines each of which connects places having the same average temperature during the year . SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL FEATURES OF CLIMATE 1 . Climate is the average of weather . 2 . Climate is determined by conditions that are more or less fixed , and so the climate of any part of the world changes very slowly ; but there is ample evidence that great changes have occurred in past geological ages . 3 . The three main elements of climate are temperature , moisture , and winds . 4 . The four influences which most affect the climate of a place are latitude , altitude , nearness to the sea , and the direction of the prevailing winds . 5 . Over 99 per cent of the heat which warn 's the earth comes from the sun . 6 . The polar regions are cold because there the sun 's rays traverse very slanting and hence long paths through the atmosphere , and also because fewer rays fall upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 7 . The earth is 22 million miles nearer the sun in our winter than in our summer , but in our winter the northern hemisphere // is tipped away from the sun and so receives its rays very obliquely . 8 . Temperature decreases with altitude ( 1 ? for each 330 feet ) . Mountain tops and high plateaus are cold because the rare atmosphere permits them to radiate their heat back into space rapidly . 9 . The ocean is warmed and cooled much more slowly than the land ; oceanic climates are therefore more equable than continental climates. 10 . Winds are absorbers and distributers of heat and moisture ; they tend to impart their own temperatures to lands over which they blow , and thus to make the lands warmer or colder , wetter or drier , as the case may be . 11 . Cold or warm ocean currents affect the temperature of the winds that blow over them , and these in turn affect the climate of the land . CLIMATE AND MAN Life in the Arctic . It seems strange that anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter ; yet thousands of Eskimos and a number of other tribes live there . On a few occasions Eskimos have been brought to the United States , but they were unhappy and unhealthy and longed to get back to their northern home . Seasons and " Days " in the Far North . ? Summer is the period of light , and winter the period of darkness . At the Arctic circle the longest period of continuous sunlight is 24 hours ; at 70 ? latitude , it is two months ; at 78 ? , four months ; and at the poles , six months . To these periods of actual sunlight should be added ( 1 ) further duration resulting from the fact that refraction of the sun 's rays increases the length of the period of light ; ( 2 ) periods of long polar twilight varying from hours at the circles to weeks at the poles . In northern Norway , Lapland , and Alaska beyond the Arctic circle a few hardy grains are grown . The reindeer has been domesticated and is the main dependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal ; its milk and flesh furnish food ; and its skin is used for clothing , blankets , and tents . // The uncivilized Eskimos of northern America represent a people who live the natural life of the Arctic zone . Their mode of life is in strict accord with their climatic environment , and therefore forms an interesting study in the effect of a cold climate upon the life and customs of people . The Eskimos are thus described by one who has visited them : The uncivilized Eskimos are spread in scattered settlements from just west of Bering Straits to the eastern coast of Greenland , fringing the mainland and also occupying the coast of some of the islands . Formerly throughout this area , and at present in those places out of reach of the influence of white men , the Eskimos have been engaged in one of the most serious struggles against adverse geographic conditions of any people in the world . . . . They must look out to the sea not only for the bulk of their food , but also for materials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly kept up , and by the exercise of intelligence , energy , and ingenuity , is it possible for them to maintain life amid such surroundings . Since the food supply is shifting and uncertain , it is not usual for them to have fixed homes ; they must ever be ready to move from point to point when the food supply fails . Consequently , though not strictly nomadic , they are migratory within a narrow range . This necessary mode of life of the Eskimo places a distinct limitation upon the amount of property that can be accumulated , for anything in excess of actual needs must be left behind when the time for moving comes . The boat // ( kayak ) , which the men use in hunting , the large skin boat ( oomiak ) , in which the women and children move the property from place to place , a few skins for cover and for tents , the clothing which they wear , and a few simple imple ments constitute the outfit of Eskimo communities . The winter home is of ice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also because it is easily worked and quickly built into the igloo form , and because it furnishes the best of shelter against the Arctic cold . The summer home con sists of a few skins thrown over upright supports , usually the bones of large animals , easily put together , easily taken down , and easy to transport . For fuel in winter the blubber of the seal or walrus suffices , and in summer little or no fuel is used , since meat is relished in the raw state . The boat is made of skin wrapped around a frame of bone or , where pos sible , of wood that has drifted ashore . The hunting boat , or kayak , is long and narrow and can be propelled through the water with great rapidity , this being necessary in the seal hunt . . . . The winter sled is also an'ingenious contrivance made of bone , or wood and bone , fastened together with thongs , shod with bone or ivory , and attached to the dog team with sinew . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no large settlements , for success depends upon scattering , otherwise the food supply in a locality would soon be exhausted . . . . Such a life necessarily breeds hardiness , courage , cunning , and intelligent ingenuity ; but both the severe struggle for existence and the necessary mode of life are adverse to the internal development of civilization . ' The continent of Antarctica is larger than Australia ; it is deeply buried under snow and ice and is surrounded by the great Antarctic or Southern Ocean ; it is far removed from the other continents and has no human inhabitants . LIFE IN THE TROPICS Equatorial Lowlands . ? Here snow never falls , frost never oc curs ; day and night are always about 12 hours long , and there is little dawn or twilight ; thunder storms occur almost every after-noon in the wet season ; a dense jungle usually covers the land ; insects are a pest and a menace ; birds have gorgeous plumage ; flowers are brilliantly colored ; weeds are unconquerable ; agricul ture is discouraging ; malaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent ; the native peoples are dark skinned , usually lazy , content to live on what nature provides , and disposed to pro296 HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY duce little beyond their few simple needs . There are so-called wet and dry seasons , or even two of each , due to the migration of the doldrums with the sun north from the equator a few degrees and then south again . These regions have never produced a people or nation that contributed anything of importance to human advancement . Though the torrid zone includes a third of the land of the earth , it is practically all ruled by Europeans or descendants of Europeans . White men can not live long at a time and retain their vigor in the equatorial lowlands . Tropical highlands are cool , but the climate is likely to be monotonously uniform . Rainfall may be heavy or light , depending upon the direction of the winds . Quito , near the equator in Ecuador , is over 9000 feet above the sea ; the mean temperature of // its coldest month is only one degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of temperature from day to night is 20 times as great . A majority of the people of western America from Bolivia to Mexico live on the plateaus at elevations ranging from a mile to two miles above sea level . The trade-wind belts differ widely in different portions . Since the trades blow from cooler to warmer regions , their tendency is to absorb and not to precipitate moisture , and thus they are likely to produce deserts . Arabia and the Sahara and the deserts of Aus tralia and of South Africa are mainly in regions over which the trades blow . If , however , the trade winds , blowing from the sea , encounter mountains , as they do in Brazil and Central America , // they bring rainfall , perhaps iii great abundance ; yet deserts are much more common than jungles in the trade wind belts . The Savannas or Grass Lands . ? Between the equatorial forests and the trade-wind deserts there is usually an irregular belt which has a wet season followed by a very dry one . The Sudan , south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our summer , as the sun moves northward , the belt of equa torial rains moves northward over the Sudan , bringing to it the rainy season . Later , the equatorial rain belt moves southward , and the Sudan is then brought under the influence of the trades and the dry season follows . Under these conCLIMATE // ditions forests can not maintain themselves , but grass grows abundantly . Regions of this type are called savannas . The llanos of Venezuela , the cant pas of southern Brazil , and the park lands of South Africa are savannas . They are used for pasturing cattle and sheep , but have nowhere as yet attained importance as the home of progressive peoples . Life in the desert is hard and the severe conditions strongly influence the habits and even the moral standards of the desert people . Huntington , who has seen much of these people , has pointed out how the desert affects the Arab 's views of right and wrong : No argument is needed to prove that the moral standards of the desert are vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us may seem not only right but laudable to them . To what shall we ascribe this ? There is ground for believing that many of the most prominent Arab traits have been caused , or at least fostered , by the hard conditions imposed by the desert climate . Consider what happens to an Arab nomad during the course of a year . In the spring , when the camels , goats , and sheep are giving abundance of milk , he lays up a store of sour cheese and curds , dried as hard as the toughest hard-tack . Then when the summer comes he exchanges his surplus animals , chiefly the young males , for dates , wheat , and rice grown in the oases or in the border // lands where agriculture is possible . A few animals may be saved for future use as food , but only the most wealthy can afford to eat meat often . In good years the ordinary Arab can lay by enough food to last himself and his family until the following spring . Suppose , however , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals have died on the one hand , and the price of dates and wheat is high because the crop is scanty on the other hand . In that case a large number of the nomadic Arabs are unable to lay by food enough to last them later than perhaps February , the time when the rains ought to come and the young sheep and camels to begin to be born , and the milk to be abundant . . . . Imagine the state of people who eagerly pack their tents and all their crude belongings upon camels and travel one or two hundred miles simply because they have heard that a little shower has fallen over an area no larger than that watered by a single summer thunderstorm in America . Yet this is a common occurrence in Arabia . . . . What is an Arab to do when his camels , his sheep , his wife , his children , and himself are all suffering the pangs of hunger ? He can not go off to some other land and get work . . . . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is starving has little thought of right or wrong . To have such thoughts would seem to him fatal . If considerations of humanity or any other moral ideas prevent him from engaging in raids upon the tribes around him , the doom of his family is sealed , or his children die of hunger . Thus through the thousands of years since Semitic nomads first lived in Arabia the hard conditions of climate have steadily weeded out all who withheld their hands from violence . ' CLIMATES OF THE NORTH TEMPERATE ZONE Characteristics . ? Considered as a whole , the climate of the north temperate zone has four characteristics : ( 1 ) four seasons ? spring , summer , autumn , and winter ; ( 2 ) a very wid7 ' range of tem perature from the hottest to the coldest days , and from the hottest to the coldest places ; ( 3 ) winds prevailingly from the west , yet con stantly shifting ; ( 4 ) the presence of cyclones and anticyclones ( lows and highs ) moving from west to east , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been pointed out that west-facing coasts in the temperate zones have a more equable tempera ture than east-facing coasts . The former have the oceanic type of climate ( equable ) and the latter the continental type ( variable ) . In latitudes below 40 ? , west-facing coasts have relatively light rainfall , and this comes mainly in winter . In higher latitudes these coasts have heavy rainfall also chiefly in winter . // Climate of Our Pacific Coast . ? Southern California , from San Diego to San Francisco , has a great deal of sunny weather ? 200 to 250 perfectly clear days a year ? and in the south the temperature is that of almost continuous spring . The westerlies prevail in this region and three fourths of the small annual rainfall comes in December , January , February , and March . In summer the northward movement of the sun brings the horse latitudes to south-ern California , and during the four summer months little or no rain falls . Freezing temperatures are rare ; under irrigation , oranges , lemons , figs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flowers bloom in gorgeous profusion . In the vicinity of San Francisco the average rainfall is 23 inches a year ; nearly all of it falls during the six cooler months from November to April . June , July , and August as a rule are nearly rainless . The coast of California really has only two seasons , a wet // and a dry . In summer , dense banks of fog roll in from the sea and inclose the city and bay , but the neighboring mountain tops rise above the billows of white fog and are bathed in brilliant sunshine . Though San Francisco is in the latitude of Washington , D. C. , snow seldom falls and even a hard freeze is rare . The summers are cool , and summer evenings are often too chilly for comfort . The average tempera t u r e of the warmest month is only 11 degrees above that of the coldest ; contrast this with St. Louis in the interior of the continent , which has a range of 55 degrees between its warmest and its coldest month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and irrigation is extensively practiced . Climatic conditions are ideal for raising grapes , peaches , prunes , pears , apricots , and many other fruits . California produces more fruit than any other three states . Northward from San Francisco the yearly rainfall increases . The coast ranges of Washington receive about 140 inches , the highest in the United States , and the precipitation continues to be heavy along the coast well into Alaska . The rain is heaviest in winter , while the summer months are relatively dry . This is due to the fact that in winter the land is cooler than the ocean , and hence the moisture-laden winds blowing in from the Pacific // precipitate a great amount of rain on the windward or western side of both the Coast Ranges and the Cascades . Twenty times as much rain falls on the Olympic Mountains , near the Pacific coast , as falls in certain parts of the state east of the Cascade Mountains . In western Washington , Oregon , and northern California are found the most magnificent forests in the world ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pacific upon the west coast as far north as Alaska , that Sitka , 900 miles farther north than Halifax , Nova Scotia , has the same average temperature . The Climate of Western Europe . ? The warming influence of the Atlantic on the winter climate of western Europe is so great that the effect of the northerly latitude is largely offset . Ocean currents , especially the Gulf Stream , bring a great amount of heat into the north Atlantic ; the westerlies absorb this heat and carry it over Europe . But if there were no Gulf Stream , the warming influence of the Atlantic would still be great . The British Isles and the coast of Norway have heavy rainfall and are as mild in winter as are our middle Atlantic states , which are from a thousand to fifteen hundred miles farther south . The west coast of Europe , like the west coast of the United States , has more rain in the north than in the south . The winter temperatures of much of Europe change more from west to east than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west to east across Europe . The warming influence of the Atlantic is carried much farther into Europe than that of the Pacific is into North America because Europe has no high mountain barrier on its west side as North America has . The effect of the Atlantic upon winter temperatures in central Europe is shown by five rivers in Germany . Ice lies on the Rhine an average of 26 days in a year ; on the Elbe , 62 days ; on the Oder , still farther east , 70 days ; on the Vistula , 86 days ; and on the Memel , mainly in Russia , 116 days . In summer the ocean cools the winds that blow over west-facing . coasts and give to the British Isles , for example , summers as cool as those of Newfoundland and Labrador . Climate of the Interior of the ' United States . ? With the exception of land near the Pacific , and scattered regions of high altitude , // the western third of the United States is arid or semiarid . West of the 100th meridian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ordinary agriculture is rarely successful in any region where the annual rainfall is below 20 inches . Large parts of the Great Basin , included in Arizona , New Mexico , Nevada , Utah , and parts of some other states , are true deserts , because rain-bearing winds blowing from any direction are intercepted by mountains . Throughout the Great Basin agriculture is largely ( though not wholly ) dependent upon irrigation . The High Plains . ? A tier of states from the Dakotas southward to Texas , the " high plains " states , have enough rainfall for crops nearly every year , but partial crop failures sometimes occur in the western part of these states on account of drought . However , dry farming and the introduction of drought-resisting crops are helping to remedy these conditions and these states are producers of enormous quantities of cereals . This was once a grazing belt , the land of the cowboy . It is now our principal wheat-growing belt . Eastward from the 100th meridian the rainfall increases rather steadily to 30 , 40 , and 50 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , nevertheless heavy losses are occasionally sustained from too much or too little rain . These losses may reach a total of hundreds of millions of dollars in a single year , but they are spread over so great a number of states that their effect is seldom disastrous . Lying in the belt of cyclonic storms , the region is subject to rapid changes of weather and wide extremes of temperature . In the interior the summers are hot and the northern winters are severely cold . The temperature in the most northerly states may fall as low as 40 ? below zero and rise to 100 ? or higher . Throughout the interior , rain , largely derived from the Gulf of Mexico , is most frequent in spring and summer , a highly favorable condition . The Gulf states rarely have snow and the growing season for plants ( period between the last killing frost in the spring and the first in the fall ) is from 7 to S months long . Climate of the Eastern Coast of the United States . ? This may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of the // prevailing westerlies . The land immediately bordering on the Atlantic has a more equable temperature than the interior of the continent ; but the influence of the ocean does not reach far inland because the prevailing winds come from the west . In the middle Atlantic states the wind blows from the western quarter three times as much as from any other quarter . The weather is exceedingly changeable ; the winters of New England and New York are severe and the summers are fairly hot . The frequent passing of cyclones along the northern storm tracks causes indrafts of moist air from the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico and gives the eastern states ample rainfall amounting to 40 to 50 inches north of Vir ginia and 50 to 60 inches south of that state . From Florida to Maine the average temperature decreases rather steadily . For example , fruit trees blossom three weeks earlier in northern Delaware than they do 150 miles north , near New York City . Recall that a distance of 500 miles north and south on our Pacific coast makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that distance along the Atlantic coast makes three // weeks ' difference in the time of blossoming of fruit trees . This illustrates one of the differences between west-facing coasts with their oceanic climate and east-facing coasts with their continental climate . SUMMARY OF CLIMATE AND MAN In the Far North the conditions of life are so hard and the strug gle for existence is so unceasing that only a comparatively few people live there . Within the polar circles the longest period of light or darkness ( disregarding refraction or twilight ) varies from 24 hours at the circles to six months at the poles . The Antarctic continent is larger than Australia but is deeply covered with ice and snow and has no permanent inhabitants . The equatorial lowlands are regions of excessive rains and dense vegetation . The climate , always sultry and depressing , robs man of ambition ; agriculture is an incessant fight against weeds . Sustained effort is disagreeable ; work is irksome ; thrift and fore308 HIGH SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY thought are not necessary to existence , and so are little practiced ; thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise above barbarism . Tropical diseases make it dangerous for white men to continue long in these lowlands , which , as a result , remain , and are likely long to remain , among the most undeveloped parts of the earth . In the tropical highlands altitude offsets latitude , and an agreeable and healthful , yet monotonous , climate prevails . In western America , from Bolivia to Mexico , the larger part of the people live on the plateaus or in the high mountain valleys . Here the climate is cool ? even cold in Bolivia ; it is dry and fairly stimulating for a while , yet entirely lacking the tonic quality of the winters of the temperate zone . These regions are far better suited to man 's progress than are the tropical lowlands , yet they have not given the world any strong nation . The trade-wind belts are prevailingly dry on land , though not necessarily so . Where the trades blow from sea to land and encounter mountains , they cause heavy rainfall . On land these winds , blowing ever toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cause the greatest deserts of the world , notably the Sahara and the Arabian Desert . The population of the desert is relatively small yet larger than is generally supposed . The oases are usually peopled with a settled population , but the desert tribes are nomadic and lawless . When they feel the pinch of hunger , as they often do , they turn robbers and marauders , attacking caravans and raiding other tribes . This trait of the desert peoples is so general that it has evidently been bred in them by the hard life of the desert . The temperate zones are clearly the best suited to human progress . The four seasons have taught man the need of a season of sowing , a season of growth , a season of harvest , and a season of rest and recuperation . The cyclonic storms which are such an important element in the weather are believed to stimulate mental and physical energy . In the temperate zones , as nowhere else , man has learned thrift , industry , efficiency , and the value of stable government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // it agreeable . Here nature is not so generous in her gifts as in the torrid zone , yet she rewards effort much more abundantly than she does in the frigid zones .

Why is there a much wider variation in temperature along our Atlantic coast than along our Pacific coast ? CHAPTER : XVI THE OCEAN AND ITS SHORES Extent of the Ocean . The ocean waters cover about three fourths of the surface of the earth . This is quite in contrast with the moon , which has no oceans , and Mars , our nearest neighbor among the planets , which has none so far as can be discovered . The proportion of land and water surface on the earth undergoes a slow change . At one time or another shallow ocean waters have covered almost every part of the continents , as the sea-laid sedimentary rocks show . If the earth were a perfectly smooth globe , the ocean waters would cover its entire surface to a depth of 1.7 miles . Instead of being smooth , however , the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean waters collect . There is more than sufficient water to fill them , and so the ocean spreads over nearly 10,000,000 square miles of low land along the borders of the continents ( Fig. 2 ) . Unlike the continents , the oceans are all connected ; they really form one great body of water , but it is convenient to have names for the different portions , and so we speak of the Atlantic , Pacific , Indian , Arctic , and Antarctic oceans . The Ocean Basins . ? The deepest known part of the ocean is over 32,000 feet , or a little over 6 miles ( near the Philippine Islands ) . Since , in this latitude , the Pacific is over 6000 miles broad , the greatest depth is only i o 0 0 of the width . A fine hair-line drawn across this page would be too thick in proportion to its length to represent the comparative depth and width of the Pacific , or of any of the other oceans . However , the ocean basins dip below the level of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If all the land which is above sea level were scraped off and dumped into the ocean basins , it would not go far toward filling them . 311 // The ocean bottom is for the most part a plain . Near the continents and oceanic islands steep slopes occur , but since no streams are eroding valleys under the sea , and since sediments are being constantly deposited on the ocean bottom , it is a vast and monotonous plain . There are , of course , great sags and swells , over which the water is deeper or shallower as the case may be , and some of the " deeps " have quite abrupt slopes ; yet the steepest ' of these are much less abrupt than those on land . A broad swell , or ridge , extends north and south through the mid-Atlantic , reaching in places within a mile or less of the surface of the sea . Chains of islands , such as the Japanese Islands or the West Indies , are mountain chains rising from the sea floor ; the islands are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevations which do not quite reach the surface . Ocean Bottom Deposits . ? Near the shores of the continents , rivers are dumping sand , silt , and clay into the sea , and the shore currents and tides are distributing these over the sea bottom near the coasts . Only the finest of the river-brought sediments are carried more than a few hundred miles out to sea . Most of them are deposited on the continental shelf , as the submerged margin of a continent is called . // Somewhat less than half of the ocean is two miles or less in depth , and this portion is covered with an ooze formed mainly of the skeletons of microscopic creatures . More than half of the ocean is over two miles deep , and here the sea-bottom sediments form a peculiar red clay made up of those parts of the tiny skeletons which do not dissolve . These last-mentioned sediments accumulate very , very slowly . Composition of the Ocean Water . ? The rivers carry dissolved mineral matter to the sea , and as the ocean waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral matter is left behind in the ocean . Two of the minerals dissolved in the sea are common salt and carbonate of lime . The latter is taken up by animal life and is used in making their shells and skeletons . The corals , for example , extract lime from the sea and build coral reefs of great extent ( h'ig. 220 ) . The salt is not much used by sea life , and so it accumulates age after age ; the ocean now contains enough salt to make a layer 175 feet thick over its entire bed . Many other kinds of dissolved mineral matter are found in the sea , the total forming about 32 parts to each hundred parts of water . // one place the ocean temperature seldom varies more than 10 degrees during the year , while land temperatures often vary more than ten times that amount . In the equatorial region the surface of the sea averages about 80 ? F. In the inclosed Red Sea the surface temperature may rise to 90 ? or even higher . In the polar regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which point salt water freezes . Proceeding from the equator toward the poles , the temperature of the ocean does not de-crease uniformly . In some places warm currents or drifts reach far toward the poles , and elsewhere cold currents from high 1a-0- tulles reach far into the temperate zones ( Fig. 222 ) . As a rule the ocean be- conies colder with increas-ing depth , but below 4000 feet the temperature is found to be between 35 ? and 40 ? F. , and at the greatest depth to be below 35 ? . Only in the frigid and in the very cold parts of the temperate zones does the ocean water freeze . Nearly all the ports on the west side of North America and Europe are open throughout the year ; those in North America from the Gulf of St. Lawrence southward never freeze . The great amount of ocean surface , and the comparatively slight change in ocean tempera-tore from season to season have a most beneficial effect upon the earth 's climate . Were it not for this influence of the ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be almost , if not quite , unbearable . Life in the Ocean . ? Air , which is necessary to plant and animal life , is dissolved in the ocean water , but it is mainly confined to the upper portion . Light in only a small amount penetrates below 300 feet , hence plants or animals requiring light can not live at a // depth much greater than this ; but a little plant life is found down to depths of 1000 feet . While there are microscopic creatures in every part of the sea , most of the life is found in the uppermost 300 feet of water . Some life exists even in the deepest water , but it is exceedingly scanty in the intermediate portions , that is , between the bottom of the sea and the 300 feet at the top . At great depths the pressure is enormous , and fish which live there are especially constructed to resist this pressure . When caught and raised to the surface they sometimes burst or " explode . " Some of the deepsea fish have eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures are phosphorescent ; that is , they emit a light somewhat like that given out by the head of a match when it is slightly rubbed in the dark . The animal life of the sea is almost endless in variety ; it includes the largest existing animal , the whale , and many others of large size , such as seals , sea lions , and walruses . Most forms of animal life in the sea extract lime carbonate from the water and with it build their own skeletons or shells . Conspicuous among them is the tiny coral polyp which lives in colonies of millions and builds coral reefs sometimes hundreds of miles in extent . The limestone rocks which cover large areas of the earth are mainly composed of material collected and deposited by animal life in the sea . Food from the Sea . ? It is estimated that man obtains at least $500,000,000 worth of food from the sea each year ; this is largely made up of oysters , clams , lobsters , cod , mackerel , herring , and many kinds of fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Sea , or on the so-called fishing banks , like those south and southeast of Newfoundland . MOVEMENTS OF OCEAN WATERS Wind Waves . ? As the wind blows over the water , the friction of the moving air upon the surface of the water heaps it up into waves , the size of the wave depending upon the violence of the wind . The wave form moves forward with the wind , but the movement of the water in the wave is mainly up and down , as // may be seen by observing a floating piece of wood . Some of the surface water is dragged forward by the wind , although far more slowly than the wave itself progresses . Upon reaching shallow water near shore , the bottom of the wave is retarded by friction upon the sea bottom and the top of the wave tumbles forward , forming white-crested breakers . Ocean Currents . ? Wherever the wind blows more or less constantly over the ocean in one general direction , the surface water is set in motion in the same direction and a surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means so well defined as the map ( Fig. 222 ) seems to indicate . In most cases they are to be thought of rather as slow drifts of surface water than as distinct currents . The Equatorial Currents . In both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans the trade winds produce westward-moving currents on each side of the heat equator , while between these is a return current moving eastward ( Fig. 222 ) . The Gulf Stream. ? The equatorial currents of the Atlantic divide as they approach the wedgelike nose of South America . The northern branch flows through the Caribbean Sea , whence part of it passes northward by way of the West Indies , and part enters the Gulf of Mexico . A large amount of fresh water also flows into the Gulf from rivers . The water that flows through the narrow straight between Cuba and Florida and thence in a northeasterly direction is known as the Gulf Stream . As it leaves the Strait of Florida it has a velocity of 5 miles an hour , is 50 miles wide , and occupies the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic can be noted by the warmth , color , and motion of its water . Some distance out from the strait , the Gulf Stream is joined by the warm water which has come from the equatorial region by way of the West Indies ( Fig. 222 ) ; before the mid-Atlantic is reached , the " stream " has spread out more and more fanlike , its rate of movement continues to diminish , and it merges into what is known as the North Atlantic Drift , with a movement of only 8 or 9 miles a day . So much heat is thus carried into the North Atlantic that Norway , in the latitude of // Greenland , has a fairly mild winter climate and its ports are never frozen ; the British Isles are as mild in winter as Maryland , 1400 miles farther south . The Labrador Current ( Fig. 222 ) , and other return currents both at the surface and below , carry back toward the equator the water which drifted north in the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift . The Labrador Current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nova Scotia , and exerts a cooling influence on the Canadian and New England coasts . Near Newfoundland it encounters the warm North Atlantic Drift , and the mixing of the cold and warm air over these waters causes dense fogs , which are dreaded by navigators , particularly on account of the gigantic icebergs that float south in the Labrador Current . Currents of the Pacific . The Pacific has its equatorial currents , its Japan Current which corresponds to the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic , and its west-wind drift . The Japan Current is less distinct and less important than the Gulf Stream . The North Pacific drift of warm water imparts its temperature to the westerly winds and they give a mild oceanic climate to the Pacific coast of North America ; but because of the mountains near the Pacific coast the oceanic influence is not carried so far into North America as it is into Europe from the Atlantic . The Currents of the Southern Hemisphere are less important than those of the northern , mainly because the oceans of the northern hemisphere are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populous than the southern . The position and direction of the currents of the southern hemisphere are shown in Fig. 222 . Causes of Ocean Currents . ? The close agreement between the direction of the prevailing winds and that of the principal ocean currents and drifts leaves no room for doubt that these winds are the main cause of the currents . Yet they are not the sole cause . Wherever the wind forces the water to move away from any portion of the sea , other water flows in to take its place , and thus an extensive and complex circulation is set up . There are also other causes for the circulation of ocean waters , such as unequal heating , // differences in salinity , and the inflowing of rivers . The direction of the main currents is determined not only by the direction of the prevailing winds , but also by the earth 's rotation , and by the shape of the continents . Tides . ? An observer at almost any port may note that ( luring periods of about 6 hours each day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours it falls . This rising and sinking of the water is known as the tide . During the rising or incoming movement the tide is said to floc , and the highest water is called flood tide ; the outgoing or receding movement is ebb tide . There are ordinarily two flood tides and two ebb tides every 24 hours and 52 minutes . Cause of Tides . ? This rising of the tide is due mainly to the attraction of the moon and also in a lesser degree to the attraction of the sun upon the ocean waters . Though the moon is much smaller than the sun , it is only 41,0 as far away from the earth , and this makes it more effective in producing tides . When the sun , moon , and earth are about in a straight line , and so are pulling to gether , the highest tides , called spring tides , are produced ( Fig.
