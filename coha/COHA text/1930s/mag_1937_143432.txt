King 's Ordeal <P> Sirs : <P> How do you get a King to pose for his photograph for TIME 'S cover ( Leopold of Belgium , Nov. 22 ) - particularly a colored photograph ? I 've always understood that taking a colored photograph meant several hours ' hard work for the sitter , and considering the divinity which hedges a King how does he put up with such an ordeal ? <P> ALBERT G. PETTINGILL <P> San Francisco , Calif . <P> Reader Pettingill senses the truth . Although permission to photograph King Leopold III in color had not been granted by the Royal Chancellory even to leading Belgian illustrated magazines , recently His Majesty graciously agreed to sit for a color photograph . TIME 'S Photographers Leigh Irwin and Nicholas Langen arrived one morning at the Royal Palace with 16 suitcases of equipment . One of the King 's aides met them , ushered them into the King 's 40-ft. by 60-ft. study where , with the active assistance of palace servants and electricians , they spent a busy half-hour setting up their camera and six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to provide exactly the best lighting effects on anyone sitting in the King 's chair . At precisely the appointed hour the King entered through his private door . He shook hands , chatted in English and French with the photographers , showed that he knew the rudiments of color photography . Then he sat down at his desk . In three minutes with His Majesty at his desk , Irwin &; Langen made the final nice adjustments of their equipment , set their camera for an exposure of 1 50th second and shot . The flash bulbs went off with a loud explosion and a blinding flash-they were made for 110 volts and the palace circuit carried 220 volts . The apologetic photographers explained that something had gone wrong . The King amiably agreed to pose again provided there would not be another such explosion . He left the room and returned in ten minutes after adjustments had been made . Another three minutes posing , better behaved flash bulbs and the picture which TIME selected for its cover was taken. - ED . <P> Mind on Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robertson , TIME , Nov. 22 , p. 8 . <P> Did TIME have its mind on the game when it selected this picture of Helen Wills Moody in action ? Or on something else ? <P> LAURENCE S. MORRISON <P> Hartford , Conn . <P> TIME had its mind on reporting the news-in this case , the career of an energetic sportswoman , both of whose feet were seldom on the ground while she was playing tennis. - ED . <P> Noses in News <P> Sirs : <P> May I question the accurateness of your nose for news ? <P> After an evening of research at the dinner table , it has been decided the facial postures of Drenchers Litvinoff and Eden ( TIME , Nov. 22 , p. 21 ) are not due to any political , social , or cultural affiliations of either , but rather to the stage of tea drinking reached by each . It would seem that " Red Litvinoff " is on his first cautious sip from a full cup of tea while " Tory Eden " is draining the dregs . Let TIME 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose into it . <P> MRS . SAMUEL GOULD <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> There is no telling what people will do when in their tea cups. - ED . <P> No Services <P> Sirs :
