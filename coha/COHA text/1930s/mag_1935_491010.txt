THE SIITEIRDRY EVENING POST Founded A9D11728 by Benj.Franklin Volume 207 5c . THE COPY PHILADELPHIA , PA. , JANUARY /2 , 1935 $2.00 Ry Number 28 I N THIS article I am expressing my personal opinions . Wherever they may be found not to be in accord with existing policy or action , this can not properly be construed as criticism of what is being done . It is merely difference in point of view . The President does not need to be told that , whatever my own judgment may be , I would , as an executive , bow to his and fight for it with all that I can give . Removed from official life , I feel free to think independently and to say what I think openly . After all , it is only one man 's thought . In my opinion , the question of the future of American recovery resides in ten problems : 1 . Debt , public and private . 2 . Taxes , Federal , state and local . 3 . Money and public credit . 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . Relief . 7 . Agriculture . 8 . Foreign trade . 9 . Co-ordinated and cohesive government . 10 . The future of the recovery program . These problems may be thus separated for the purpose of discussion , but they are not separate . They are correlative , and they merge into one another with indistinguishable demarcations . It is almost impossible to talk about one without finding yourself all mixed up with another . It is not the purpose here to write an essay on economics or lift the curtain on a new crateful of white rabbits , but only to express a faith in a few fundamental principleS . Before proceeding to discuss these questions , it should be urged that every element for prosperity is here  --  money , vast pools of credit , great resources , starved demand , fine facilities for manufacture , sale and distribution , and a brave , active , alert and patriotic people . It is trite to say that the single missing element is confidence . But confidence felt by whom ? By workers ? By farmers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will so continue . They have to . But workers ca n't work unless somebody will pay them wages . The answer as to whose confidence must be restored is so obvious that it hardly seems debatable . Men ca n't go back to work until money goes back to work , and money wo n't go back to work unless those who have or are responsible for money to invest in creating work know that , once it is out of their hands , no magic is going to frisk it away like fairy gold turning into crisp and colored autumn leaves . It is perfectly clear that recovery in a big and quick and powerful wave awaits only an impeccable assurance in deeds , and not words , that no such thing will happen . That is all there is to it . It could be done immediately . And unless it is done promptly , there is no end in sight . There are now current a lot of impassioned appeals to banks and industries to get busy and start recovery . Some business associations have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that seems nonsense . If any business man held the key to recovery all this time and did not use it , he ought to he lynched . No business has held that key . Banks and business corporations are trustees of 0 . P. M. ? other people 's money . They are there to do business when they can do so safely and in proper discharge of their trust . They are avid to do it when they can do it that way  --  that is , profitably . But there are penitentiaries and bankruptcy courts and public condemnation for people who play recklessly with their obligations . No amount of belaboring business and talking about timidity , by men who never conducted a business in their lives , is going to change these essential responsibilities . To demand that industry at once give employment to 10,000,000 men is a demand that it produce far more goods than it . can sell , or increase its plant capacity when there is no market for its product . No responsible management can do this , and surely no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becloud the present economic horizon . To make this demand and couple it , as Mr. Richberg recently did , with a threat that , unless industry does so employ these millions , the Government will , smacks of the modern caveman who wooed the object of his affection with the statement : " Love me , ? ? you , or I 'll beat you to death . " Furthermore , the threat itself of the Government employing 10,000,0001-nen is absurd . When these idle had work , the American business turnover was about $90,000,000,000 . It is now about $40,000,000,000 . At the most that Government could do , it might employ 3,000,000 by spending $3,000,000,000 , but it is not a gap of $3,000 , - 000,000 that is to be bridged . It is a gap of $50,000,000,000 . And that gap must be bridged if we are to have recovery . That Can happen only by creating justified confidence in the political economy of the United States , and such ill-informed bulldozing will not create that eon ti-deuce . The Problem of Debt T HEparalyzing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt burden contracted on high-market values of real estate , securities and commodities which 6 remained after these values and the markets in which they might be sold had shrunk to a fraction , leaving that debt in full effect . at its original figure . That , placed upon commerce and industry andehmen the consuming power of every debtor a burden many times heavier than the debt burden before the collapse . It was t his more I ban any other single cause that ruined business . Now , there were two ways , or a combination of two ways , to meet this situation  --  one by a. surgical operation and the other by a pulmotor and continuous artificial respiration . The first was to recognize that the values on which the debts were made were mere phantoms  --  never truly existing and gone forever  --  and on that recognition fearlessly to cut down the debts themselves . The latter was to try to blow value back into the deflated assets and incomes upon which the debts were erected . By one of these methods , or a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the steam like a savage with smallpox and grimly sweating it out to the death , was recovery possible . We did not choose to sweat it out , and we did not choose to cut it down . We chose to try to restore value to the assets on which the debt was based , by various devices . Now , nobody in the world had ever done this by design without creating a cataclysm such as the complete destruction of the German mark , the Russian ruble , the French assignats and the Confederate currency . But we thought we could do it . and there was reason for thinking so . We tried it through reduction of the gold content of the dollar . We tried it earnestly and thoroughly and sincerely , but the reason was n't good enough and the method did not work . Prices refused to rise in inverse ratio to the gold content as promised by the plan , and that plan now stands completely discredited by the most thorough test that could be given it .. Now , I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a laboratory demonstration of the fallacy of an old illusion . I cherished it myself . But I believe it would have been wiser either to have coupled with it , or to have tried separately , a deliberate scaling down of debts . I am sure it would still be wise and that it is urgently necessary . It could have been done , and it still can be done , in a combination of two ways : ( a ) We can amend the bankruptcy laws to provide , in the shortest and most direct and effective manner possible , for a realistic scaling down of debt by composition and discharge , with the consent of a majority of the creditor interests , under the widest discretion of the Federal courts to prevent abuse . ( 6 ) Instead of having the Government take over home and farm and other mortgages on valuations that no longer exist  --  a policy adopted on the assumption that value could be blown back into them  --  let the Government agencies offer to take up any of these securities  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exceed , say , 75 per cent of face value , pool them , offer to the mortgagee debentures at the scaled-down rate , with principal and interest guaranteed by the Government , and to the mortgagor a new mortgage for the scaled-down debt . If this operation were competently carried out , the Government would have only a contingent liability on a narrow margin of widely disseminated risk ; the mortgagee would have a gilt-edged security in place of his shaky mortgage , albeit on a reduced basis , the mortgagor would have a chance for his life , and the country would be relieved of ane of the chief causes of continued depression . It is of the utmost importance to apply this principle also to public obligations of all political units . There is some opinion that it is too late to do this now , but I feel sure that is wrong . Nobody ever goes in to replace an old tumble-down or ruinous brick structure with a white marble palace without first sending in the wrecking crew . This we have failed to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // vigorous of all stops . It is never too late to do the right and the wise thing . It is not too late now to do this . We should have sense enough to clear away the wreckage of the Great Delusion . The Burden of Taxes E VERYBODY pays taxes . It makes little difference who gets the receipt , the consumer pays it all . The assertion that you can take it all out of the corporate income or of individual income in the higher brackets is blatant demagogy . Take the processing tax of the AAA , by which the manufacturer pays into a fund to give to the farmer a fixed levy on every unit of production . What happened ? That and other governmental emergency measures doubled the price of cotton overalls to the farmer . It is the farmer and the worker who wear overalls . It is they who pay the tax , even if the original assessment lies against . a big corporation . It is so of every tax . They are drags on consumption , and hence on production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the wealthy will always be comfortable , but the poor must fret under the daily care of keeping out hunger , thirst and cold . You ca n't distribute wealth by grotesque and demagogic taxation  --  you can only distribute poverty . If you tax a corporation , it will only peg up its price to the consumer ; and whether it be levied against canned beans , or blue overalls , or anything that moves in commerce , the person who consumes pays it . It cuts down his power to consume and makes directly against production and employment . Furthermore , this constant assessment , which must be paid in spot cash , creates a constant liquidating movement which is much less than wise at this parlous time . Our great lag in employment is in the heavy , or capital-goods , industries  --  that is to say , those which make locomotives and big machines and factories and hotels and houses . Nearly half the unemployed in the country  --  perhaps 5,060,000 breadwinners who ought to be working there  --  have been out of jobs for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money do not buy any of these things . Most of them are bought by big corporations . But corporations ca n't buy them unless they can sell stocks and bonds to get the money to buy them . And no man is going to buy their steels and bonds unless they can show that they are going to make enough money to pay dividends on the stock and interest and amortization on the bonds . Until the capital-goods industries and other industries using their products can show how they can make money , nobody is going to see reemployment in this great pool of idleness . All the berating of banks and-accusation of industry for not making money available to start these industries will not change that situation or give the workers in those industries back their jobs . And no public-works January 12,103.5 program alone can initiate the activity necessary here to employ the labor normally appertinent to these industries . Now , the people who have much or little idle money or mortgageable future income to buy stocks and bonds are the people who have above a bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tried to pile on nearly all the taxes . I know a man  --  and he is not one of the country 's wealthiest mon either  --  from whom , if he made a dollar , the various tax burdens of city , state and nation would take eighty-three cents of it . It is going to be pretty hard to convince him that he ought to take any kind of a risk at all to make a dollar . If he risks it and loses it , he loses it all . If he risks it and makes anything , he gets only 17 per cent of what he makes . He would be a fool to put it into anything that did not have about a 6-to-1 chance of profit , and almost nothing now has such a chance . Nothing less than a great fear of marked inflation will move that man . This is an extreme case , but it illustrates a point . You can get taxes so high on particular sources that you wo n't get revenue , but you will paralyze the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which people have to have or starve  --  or tobacco  --  which is a habit and wo n't be denied  --  or clothing and coal  --  which people have to have or freeze  --  and that is pretty nearly the state we are in today . You do n't got revenue , because you stifle trade and adventure . You could got far more another way . And you do n't relieve the poor , because they pay the taxes anyway . But you do oppress the poor , because you destroy employment . Yet , as everybody knows , we will have to have more revenue from taxes in this country than we have ever had to have before in our history . The point is : Let 's look facts in the teeth and put those taxes where we can get the most revenue with the least harm to consumption , which means production , which means jobs , which mean recovery and prosperity . Our present revenue schedules are the result of pure political baloney and are not designed foranywhere near maximum revenue . To that extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery and re-employment in this country . We must have the revenue . We must have recovery . Let 's figure out a tax schedule which promises both , to replace the thing we now have , which is a stark barrier to both . In this emergency everybody who has anything coming in ought to pay some tax  --  even if it is only one dollar a year  --  to support the brave efforts of the President to see that everybody who has nothing survives without physical suffering or loss of pride and self-respect . That would not provide much revenue , but it would give everybody a personal interest in the credit of the United States . The whole revenue schedule should be revised with courage and honesty to the end that it shall encourage recovery , maintain the credit of the Government beyond peradventure of doubt , and keep us amply supplied with money to insure at all events against any impairment whatever of the health , pride , comfort and welfare of all our people . We are doing that after a fashion , but we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at all by the manner in which we are proceeding . Taxes on every conceivable source should be just as high as we can make them and still keep the machine that manufactures revenue at maximum efficiency . What is true of the Federal Government is true of all government in this country  --  state , county and municipal . What is needed more than any single thing is not just a conference of governors , but a convocation of delegates on a specific agenda worked out by experts for tax reform and co-ordination throughout this country . That requires no statute , but could be done by the Executive on the strength of the confidence of the miblic in what he plans or does . There is nothing more important than this . The capital-gains tax should he cut in half . England has none . It is a direct threat to business enterprise , and so to employment  --  the Most direct threat that could be devised . The inheritance taxes should be levied against inheritors and not against estates . Take the case of an aging man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knows that inheritance taxes will require $7,500,000 in. cash . In today 's sterile market appraised values are worthless . In so large an estate , its prompt liquidation would cut it in two . The combined result of these facts is constant forced liquidation  --  constant caving in of the whole capital structure . Properties carried on books at vast sums simply have no realizable value . Who would buy a great metropolitan hotel or office building ? Under their tax burdens and in existing conditions many of them are liabilities  --  worth less than zero ; you ca n't get recovery of business activity in such an atmosphere , and we must have business activity or perish . Several of the activities of government operate to retard it . Monetary policy is one of the principal barriers to recovery  --  a harrier that could be broken down with a result of greatly increased revenue  --  and it will stand to bar recovery and employment until it is broken down . The Problem of Money and Public Credit I HAVE yet to meet the man  --  and diligently have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything worth while about money . It has been the principal and the hottest incentive of the human race since the beginning of history . It is the goal of the fiercest and often the most ignoble appetite of man . If there is one subject about which knowledge should have been attained in the literal thousands of years since its appearance , it is money . But it did not work that way , and I certainly am not going to attempt a discourse on that subject . A few things we do know empirically through the history of thousands of incidents . Whenever people think , for any reason , that tangible things are going to be worth more than the dollars in their pockets , they scramble to turn dollars into tangibles . And , conversely , when they think values are going the other way , they scramble to trade things for dollars . The first kind of scramble makes prices go up ; the second makes prices go down . It is all a question of what people think  --  whether prices go up or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fast and furiously , we have what we call a runaway market or a panic . We pay silly prices for either Florida land lots , or , as in 1929 , for shares of stock . Or , on the other tack , we sell our perfectly good securities for a song , as many of us did in February , 1933 . In such times it is not a question of what people think , but a question of what people fear and of how they will act in a panic of fear  --  as a man will run from his burning house carrying a pillow and leave his watch and pocketbook to be burned in the place where the pillow rested . In other words , the value of money is a matter of mental process  --  deliberate and based on facts most of the time , but confused and even lunatic when enough has happened to cause panic fear . In a general way , the value , or rather the stability , of a nation 's money is based on four pillars : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up the amount of paper money outstanding . 2 . Whether it is a creditor or a debtor nation . 3 . Whether it has a favorable or an unfavorable balance of trade . 4 . The safety of its fiscal policy . Just what the whole effect of a gold reserve may be is not certain . Gold may be necessary in settling unfavorable balances of trade  --  that is , paying for what the nation buys  --  imports  --  in excess of its sales  --  exports  --  but when it exports more than it imports , this may not be ( Continued on Page 76 ) ? ? TEE IPUTU important . Or , if it is a debtor nation gold may be necessary in squaring in : terest and maturities . But if it is a creditor nation , this also may not be so important . If a nation spends on government more than it receives in taxes , it is like an individual who lays out more than he takes in  --  he has to borrow . If the chances are that he will surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can borrow in prudent amount and for a reasonable time . If the chances are otherwise , he ca n't borrow  --  not until he snaps out of it and cuts down his spending or increases his income , or both , It is somewhat the same with a nation  --  except that a nation can do something an individual ca n't do . It can print pieces of paper or metal , or use wampum , or even hokum , and say to all its citizens : " Here ; this is money ; take it and like it . " Whether it can get away with that for long is another question . It ca n't get away with it at all when all four pillars are gone or rotten . We know that . But can it get away with it when only one is bad and all the rest are good ? Nobody knows ; it was never tried in those circumstances . And just what bearing each of those four pillars has on the value of money , or which of them is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print money or issue funny money with all four pillars rotten or absent , that money gets to be utterly worthless very promptly , and by the process of making it worthless , all debts are wiped out . And some other very terrible things happen . It does n't get worthless overnight , Prices begin to go up . Everybody rushes to trade his money for things , and that makes prices go up faster , Finally they go up so fast and so far that a million dollars today wo n't buy what a ten-dollar bill would buy a year ago . This is fine for people who have things to sell . But it is ruin and starvation and loss of savings and everything of value to every man who works for a salary or wages and depends on them for a living  --  to widows and orphans living on insurance , to people who rely on incomes from bonds or mortgages or pensions or savings in the banks ; of all classes , labor has the greatest stake against inflation . For all these people  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 per cent of all our people  --  funny money is just confiscation of everything they have and of the purchasing power of what they can hope to earn . This kind of thing has happened several times in history . It happened in France at the time of the assignats . It happened during  --  the Revolution , with the Continental currency , and that is why we still say " not worth a continental . " It happened here also with the Confederate currency . It happened in Germany and it happened in Russia . But there was this circumstance which makes all of those incidents entirely different from what exists in the United States now  --  in every one of those instances there was no gold reserve , the nation was deep in debt to other nations , the nation bought and imported more than it sold and exported , and its fiscal policy was terrible . This country has more than a hundred cents in gold for every dollar of itspaper money . It is a creditor rather than a debtor to the world , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on neither score does it have to export net money balances . When a country has to pay such balances to other countries , its money goes under ari arithmetical formula ; and if it is n't very good , that fact is demonstrated to . the world . Its value goes to nothing promptly . Our favorable position on all these tests tends to make and keep the dollar valuable and to maintain the credit of the United States in spite of all the manhandling it has suffered at home . Only in one of these four pillars of value are the money and credit of this country in danger . Its fiscal system and policy are terrible . This administration did not start that . It was started in 1930 . It is bad not so much because of immense and necessary spending beyond income but because we have not frankly borrowed the money to pay the excess of our expenses over income . We have used obscure devices to get that money . There has not been much real borrowing from the people of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing of Government bonds on banks and a series of bookkeeping entries whereby the Government took the depositors ' money from the banks and put Government obligations there in its place . We have coined , not our credit but our debts . With that kind of operation nobody knows the real status of the credit of the United States in a free market for its obligations . This kind of thing has been going on for at least four years . How long can we keep up that magic without destroying confidence in the public credit ? Nobody knows , but it is all on the bad side of the ledger . That is the only question  --  and there is no historical precedent for the answer , because there is none for the condition of a nation standing on three perfectly sound financial legs and only one rickety one . The question is : " How long can we go on playing with the broken leg and not produce the state of panic fear that might impair the confidence of people in the money and credit of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Nobody can tell us . But our excursions into unknown fiscal fields are very delicate and dangerous things , for , once the credit of the United States slides , all credit in the country slides with it . Recently we have been knowingly playing with the value of our money , with the deliberate and announced purpose of creating just enough fear of its future to make people want to change it into goods , in the hope that we could thus increase prices to , say , the 1926 level , as a way to blow value back into assets so that we can pay off debts . That overlooks the terrific burden that would be thus placed on wage and salary earners and consumers generally  --  but let that pass . All that we have done so far has largely failed to work that way , and the Roosevelt dollar is still as sound as any money in the world . There are those who believe that if we could get the fear motive to work , the situation could be controlled . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money can be created , by monkeying with it , to cause a national mental state where people will want to change their money to things to start prices upward and at some point  --  say , the 1926 price level  --  that we can turn off the fear motive and stabilize prices . We actually tried that but never got enough fear turned ou , much less ever had a chance to see if we could turn it off and stop the rise in prices . Fear and panic about other things rarely are subject to this kind of precise control ; and even if they were , it certainly would take a master hand and mind to push them just far enough and not one thread 's breadth farther  --  like some great surgeon chiseling delicately away at the skull of a mastoid sufferer , until only a pink skein of bone as thin as gossamer remains between the last film of disease and the brain against which one touch means death . The great surgeon whose fingers , long trained and directed by a specialized mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his genius is " to know when to stop . " Any butcher could cut out the disease . But who can do it and yet save the life which the disease threatens ? If there be any such specialist in this country , I do n't know who he is , or where he is , or from whence he got his training . I think we can not afford to fool much further with the Federal credit . I never thought you ? could regulate panic or secure prosperity through fear . Yet we must still have billions to spend to relieve distress . It does not seem too difficult a problem . Two roads are open  --  one to degrade the Federal credit ; the other to maintain it and use it . One is to try to scare money out of people by threats to its value ; the other is to try to persuade money out of people by creating confidence in its value . The fear plan seems harum-scarum on any analysis . There is no instance of its working in the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , the only sound recovery that ever came proceeded through confidence and not through fear . I think it is about time to try the certain route . Everything is ripe for it . We have suffered long enough . For the latter purpose , one simple rule will serve . To balance the ordinary expenditures of Government with certain revenue . To borrow frankly in the orthodox manner for every necessary cent of extraordinary spending . This can be done if only interest and a prudent charge for amortization be provided by new revenue properly distributed on the law of diminishing returns , and then segregated to the debt account . On such a basis , this country can and should borrow and spend every dollar that is necessary for emergency spending and to provide relief . We probably would have spent $30,000,000,000 more than we did in 1917 , ' 18 and ' 19 , if the war had run on into 1919 , and nobody turned so much as a hair . The credit of the country is ample for this new war : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private credit rests on the public credit , and as long as the latter is threatened  --  either by rash action or the fear of rash action  --  private credit will remain where it now is  --  hibernating in a hole . Not all the threats , entreaties and blandishments in the whole world can cajole it out to activate business , as long as this shadow hangs over it . The other road  --  scaring money into tangibles by turning fear of values on and off  --  is a bar not only to production and employment but it is a threat to the whole working and white-collar element of this people . They have borne the brunt of this depression and they stand on the spot for any further practice of any fiscal policy which may prolong it  --  some 80 per cent of the population  --  they are the forgotten men  --  the actual forgotten men whom old Sumner had in mind and most accurately described . I firmly believe that , if steps were taken tomorrow to put the monetary and borrowing policy of the . Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relegated to the limbo of forgotten things in three months ' time . The Labor  --  Management Problem AFTER as acute an experience with .. LA. it as any man has had , I am very sure that the problem is much further from any composition than it has ever been since I had anything to do with it . The battle lines are drawing nearer and the tension is higher with every month that passes . It is another of the principal factors retarding recovery . Something must be done about it , and be done quickly . For reasons fully developed in these pages I am convinced beyond question : ( a ) That , while there should be no compulsion to join any union on any man  --  either from government , management , or labor  --  we should fa-v.5r organization on a vertical pattern quite to the extent of England . ( b ) That we should favor voluntary industrial organization of industry under codes . ' . ( c ) That the ) natural partnership which should exist between labor and management must be approached at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that any attempt to do it by compulsion is abortive . I never yet heard of a shotgun wedding that lasted beyond the doorstep of the Justice of the Peace . I think the whole system in which the so-called impartial labor boards are now set up is wrong , because I know the industries do not regard them as impartial , and neither do I. I think it is futile to marry these two natural spouses by haling them into the limelight as defendants before the public . It simply raises every hackle of defense and acquires at best but a sullen acquiescence . I think the idea of a conference of principal labor and industrial leaders is a practicable suggestion . At least I know that an unhurried and undisturbed deliberative counsel of practical leaders on both sides , who already have learned to respect and admire each other in NRA , would come forth with some far better suggestion than any we yet have tried . My specific suggestions briefly are : By statutory revision : I. To put Section 7-A beyond the question of doubt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when a majority of employees select a certain form of organization , no other parallel organization shall be recognized . ( b ) that no employee shall be required , as a condition of employment , to join that or any other organization . 2 . That national labor policy be worked out in conference between principal labor and industrial leaders , submitted to the President for amendment in the public interest , if necessary , ( Continued an Page 79 ) and then adapted for administration and be vigorously supported . Industry and Employment B EFORE considering the problem of re-employment at all , there is one drastic suggestion in which I thoroughly believe . There are  --  ondechirant aliens employed , or emp ! Oyable and on relief , in this country , ' variously estimated at between 2,000,1900 and 3,000,000 . There is small justification for this . It would create no avoidable hardship to exclude by Codes of Fair Competition , or in rules governing relief or public emplpyment , any person who is not a citizen or a declarant , or who , being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States within the minimum legal time limits , mid to deport all who can and do not qualify . It would give prompt employment to a good many citizens . It must be recognized that not more than 1,000,000 persons normally employed in the consumers ' - goods industries  --  not including sales and distribution and auxiliary services  --  are now without work . About 5,000,000 unemployed are appertinent to the heavy-goods industries . There are probably between 9,000 , - 000 and 10,000,000 unemployed , all together . It would be possible to reemploy 1,000,000 men by vigorous administration of NRA . Nothing yet in sight by public works will re-employ 1,000,000 additional men in the heavy-goods industries . I believe that a vigorous attack on the public-works program could double this figure  --  I mean re-employ 2,000,000 more men in capital goods in a year . I do not expect any such result and , even if it came , it would leave a vast pool of unemployment which nothing within the power of Government can reach . Nothing can reach it except to persuade private investment back into capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed in this article  --  especially debt , taxes , fiscal policy and the relationship of labor and management . It raises also the question of restoring a little more of practical realism to the legislation governing securities and the exchanges  --  not a great deal , for in spite of all the cries against it , that legislation was proved necessary by all that happened up to 1929 , and should never be relaxed except in those features where theory has crowded too cloaely on common sense . ' If-these problems were worked out , we would not have to worry about capital goods and the construction trades . A flood of private capital , long held in leash and avid for work , would rush out of a thousand hibernating holes , and much of it would head straight for these long-slowed uses . After nearly a year and a half of intense concentration on this problem , and an opportunity to see all aspects of it pass in review , I feel confident in saying that notmuch more can be done at this time by the formula of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this because I am sure that the increased cost  --  as matters stand today  --  would reduce consumption , and hence the available number of jobs . But . I do not mean to say by this , that the possibilities of this formula are exhausted . I say quite the contrary thing . If , by other means herein suggested , we can at last get the upward spiral started , I feel very sure not only that we can then give it an added spurt by shortening the work week at the same pay but also that we never are going to have complete re-employment in this country without shorter hours and higher wages as a permanent policy . There is no such thing as overproduction considered apart from underconsumption , but there is such a thing as overcapacity to produce , and let the man who doubts it say , for example , how , without an export market , we can dispose of 800,000,000 bushels of wheat per annual when our digestive apparatus will not take more than 600,000,000 . We will have to maintain balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . This can be had only by organization , codification and self-government of industry under Governmental sanction and supervision , and based upon at least the general principles of the Recovery Act . That will require an issue to be resolved between the principles of NRA and the anti-trust principles . If it turns out that the former must go down , there is nothing before us but blind staggers for another indefinite period . We should be back exactly where we started . As a dog returneth to his vomit , so a fool returneth to his folly . " Many of these subjects will be discussed at length in other articles . Specifically , I believe that we can create a great improvement if we synchronize and approach with real vigor , under a single administrative control , the following projects : 1 . Reinvigorate NRA to get wider acceptance and compliance with existing provisions of maximum hours and minimum wages  --  we could re-employ 1,000,000 men . 2 . Completely mechanize and motorize the Army . Start at once construction of semi-suburban rural obionies coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bearable loans and shared expense for railroad re-equipment , electrification and elimination of grade crossings ; break all bottle necks and speed to completion all existing projects ; give additional support to the construction , renovizing , reconstruction and repair of homes by private means  --  we could re-employ 2,500,000 . These are emergency measures ; the real steps to enduring recovery are the others mentioned . in this article . Relief of Human Suffering N-0 OTHER consideration of all the N ten recovery problems stated and discussed in this article can , by any sophistry , be twisted or by any genuine philosophy be used to avoid the absolute obligation of national , state and city governments to see to it , not merely that the bodies and souls of people who want to work and ca n't are kept together but that their self-respecting and even haughty  --  if it must be said  --  Americanism is preserved . It is utterly unjustified in a case like this to say  --  as is often said ? " They are the victims of their own folly , " or We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the shiftless , " with a side dish of reference to the fable of the ant and the butterfly . We ca n't do that , for three reasons . No individual or group is responsible for the crash and depression , and least of all the majority of those who now suffer most . But a certain conduct in leadership and government  --  and a certain sheeplike followship by all of us  --  is responsible for much of it . In such a result , the duty is on leadership and conduct of government , and , indeed , on all of us , to retrieve disaster and to bind up the wounds our mass madness has caused . Government has just simply failed in its sole purpose and justification when people can not live under it and earn their bread in the sweat of their labor . We must see to it that some 40 per cent . of our people do not sink to beggary  --  if not . for human sympathy , then for the sake of our own jolly old skins and the maintenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsions existed , we would have to acquit ourselves of this obligation because we are one people under stress of terrific forces of dissolution and , like soldiers in a siege , we must ' share our rations if we are worth the name of Americans . Of course , there are rats in our ranks  --  big ones and little ones  --  as I have cause enough to know , but they are so far in the minority as to be negligible . The chief reason why this country must acquit itself of this obligation is moral rather than economic or political . It is because it could not look at itself in its shaving mirror every morning without nausea , if it failed to do so . You could have sifted the country with a fine-meshed sieve and not have found a better Relief Administrator than Harry Hopkins . He is a go-getter . He is obsessed with no such uplift slush as might require , as a condition precedent to filling a hungry stomach , that the recipient submit to a snooping about his home surroundings by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendelssohn concert . He moves across straight lines to his objectives , and if he has a tongue like a scalpel , the skinned usually deserve what they get , and more . I think he has done the cleanest-cut job in the whole recovery show . I do think , however , that throughout the whole make-work program , not in FERA especially but everywhere , too much money is spent on making the relief dollar do the work assigned  --  in other words , that relief dollars could be made to go farther . If this is so , it needs attention , because relief dollars are not easy to get , and they are going to be progressively harder to get as time proceeds . I think that there is a field in relief for personal loans to heads of self-respecting families who , in normal times , would be rated by any lending agency as a good moral risk . A big reserve for loss could be written off against these and composition could be made from time to time to keep any such borrower from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming debt burden . The Army is skeletonized . The training of officers and noncoms with these two-squad companies is a joke . Here ties absolutely idle a vast provision of barracks , quarters , mess equipment and bedding . Without making full provision of uniform and other items of expense , without providing more pay than pocket money , without taking enlistment obligations for more than , say , a six months ' period , without transporting men for long distances , and using an existing overhead and not . creating a costly new one , there are hundreds of thousands of single men without dependents who could be absorbed here with great advantage to their own physical and mental welfare , with a very considerable release of jobs for men with dependents , with dividends to the nation in training of men to citizenship and the bearing of arms , and to the officer and noncommissioned-officer personnel of the Army in handling full-strength tactical units . These men could even be educated in night schools  --  and all this at very slight expense . I do not know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps and the National Guard , because I am not so familiar with their training and mechanism , but I imagine that there is some leeway there . The same point of saving expensive overhead is pertinent to activation of heavy industries by mechanization of the Army . It seems to me that the proper contribution of cities , states and counties shouldlnot be left so much to persuasion , and where Hopkins ' organization finds that they are laggard beyond peradventure , all Federal activity should be suspended there until they do their part . This is a matter of vital importance . If , for every Federal dollar coming to a state , as little as thirty state cents were required as an inevitable condition , there would be a very great increase in the economy of distributing it . I suspect that the network of salaried Federal employees on emergency and other jobs throughout the country receiving more than is necessary for relief  --  in many cases much more  --  absorbs too much of relief ammunition , which , if passed on to the objects of their solicitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the result which all are seeking . I think it is urgently necessary to make an immediate survey of this system , I would not dare hazard a guess of what it would show , but I think it would lead to beneficial action . I know that NRA has now gone haywire on paying fancy salaries . I think that the entire pattern of relief and emergency work should be systematized . In the first place , the whole administration of recovery is moving in a fog of obscured facts . How many people are unemployed , and where are they ? What is the part-time employment situation ? What actual changes occur froth month to month ? You ca n't get this by questionnaires . You ca n't get it by any orthodox census method without such delay and cost as to make it impracticable . But in the draft , we once took a census of 10,000,000 men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty , and at another time took one of 30,000,000 more-40,000,000 all together  --  between eighteen and forty-five . We did it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington next day at negligible expense . We did it by using the nation-wide state systems for election registrations and manning it with such volunteer workers as school=teachers , accountants , trained clerks , and so on . It was proved to be almost absolutely accurate by the later calls of men and their examination . The method is wholly applicable now . The difference between this and the census method is that , instead of having enumerators do the leg work , the registrants call at the registration places and have their cards filled out by instructed people familiar with the work of filling out forms . The registrant is given a registration card , and this is a condition precedent to relief or emergency work of any kind . The census would be complete . We could certainly vastly improve the whole recovery program if we had this data from mouth to month . Finally , effort should be made to allocate jobs by families rather than by individuals . This is especially true Conelnu  --  d on Pag ? 82 ) az THE SRTURDAY EVENING POST January IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not know what the situation is elsewhere , but 1 am convinces Ihat the amount of money we are : pending and the activity under N RA could be made very much snore effective by systematization . This is intended as criticism of eulhody . It is a suggestion that after so much furious effort we take meek , rally and reform our lines , and move forward to a new objective . . Rgriculture ' PHIS is another question of obvi-1 ous overcapacity to produce . One would think that the way to solve that problem would he to check that overcapacity , the chief basis of which is acreage . The way to do that is to rent or buy the surplus acres and return them to the public domain . Almost no price is too much to pay if we can thus achieve balance between industry and agriculture  --  a subject I shall discuss in detail . There is also no question that a tremendous saving to the farmer could be made by consolidation in the existing channels of distribution for his product , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be saved and returned to the farmer . It is true that such consolidation would make new unemployment in the field of distribution , but that would be a far simpler problem to address than the steady degradation of the agrarian segment of our population , which is , and for years has been , the blackest economic crime of American administration . Just as I believe that by the establishment of minima industry is willing to aid in taking wages out of the field of competition , so I also believe that it is willing to sustain agriculture by pixiiisg a living price for farm raw ma-t.6 s . This was done in tobacco , and 1'r-believe it could be done at least in animal products and , wheat . It can not be done by bulldozing and belaboring these industries , but I think it can be done by aiding and supporting them . Of course , the quest for new foreign markets is important , but when we recall that we import more animal and vegetable products than we export , it is pretty hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American farmer first , or at least to increase his preference therein , would not be a counsel of prudence and justice . The truth is that a combination of all means should be sought , but no glittering generality should be permitted to stand athwart a solution . Foreign Trade A LITTLE more ruthlessness in its own interest would not be a had thing for this country . If we can produce vegetable oils and fats , even at a little higher cost than we can import them , and if our agriculture has no sufficient home markets for its present products and can not sell them abroad , we could give it those home markets and kill two birds with one stone  --  improve agriculture , and give industry a new home market far better than its present market . It would increase the speed of our turnover if we gave to our own industry , agriculture and husbandry everything that we could reasonably take away from similar foreign enterprise . Furthermore , if we must lake , for example , tons of coffee and fruit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quo , if not in full preference for our farm implements . railroad and construction equipment or anything she uses , then at least in some three-cornered or even multi-lateral deal to include nations which do supply her needs . We should see to it that , for every trade favor we give , we got at least an equal favor in return . The day is past for fiat sealing of our tariff barriers . We look out on a world walled into hermetical trade compartments . We ought to give nothing without getting something . What our State Department needs is a corps of Yankee traders . They 've got a pretty good one in George Peek , but they ought to take the wraps off of him , clothe him with ample authority and let him bring home a little bacon . That is what the world will continue to do to us ; and what it has already done compares with this slightly hard-boiled suggestion as murder to swearing profane oaths on the Sabbath day . Cohesive and Coordinated Government TN THE whirl and rush of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the left hand did , but that metaphor is weak and sickly . It was more than a centipede ; and of the seventy legs on one side , one did not know all of what the other sixty-nine on its side were doing , and nothing at all of what seventy on the other side were about . The result was unquestionably a partial failure of purpose of the charted result and a. very distinct cancellation of one effort by another running counter to it . On November 1 , 1934 , the papers carried an Executive Order dated October twenty-ninth , the preamble of which recited a purpose of co-ordination , and the body of which created a new National Emergency Council composed of all the Cabinet , the Director of the Budget , Secretary Howe , the Executive Director , and twenty others who are heads of twenty out of some 140 independent administrations  --  thirty-three persons in all . This Council , including the Cabinet , is to advise the Executive Director , to present business to the President , to co-ordinate and co-operate with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under rules and regulations prescribed by the Executive Director . The Executive Director , in addition to prescribing rules and regulations , is to execute the functions and perform the duties of the Council  --  that is , to co-ordinate and co-operate with the activities of all Federal agencies under regulations by the Director , and he can do this through any person he may designate . He can appoint , fix the compensation and prescribe the duties of anybody he thinks he needs to do these things . With the consent of a state , he can use its whole niaehinery for any Federal purpose and , with the consent of any Federal agency , its whole machinery . Tucked away in the bosom of this new Council is a subcommittee  --  the Industrial Emergency Committee  --  which controls the operation of NRA , FERA , PWA and AAA . The only Cabinet member without an emergency job who is serving on that committee is Madam Secretary Perkins . She and the Executive Director are the only ones who have no direct responsibility for what the others do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Cabinet . During the war it had expanded to some score and a half or more of members and was unwieldy . The Prime Minister selected a small subcommittee and they became the steering committee of the top-heavy structure . The analogy here is almost perfect . We have a President who , under our form of government , has far more power than the British King , and now we have an Executive Director who has all the power of a Prime Minister  --  the broad grants of this order could mean anything , and will be interpreted to mean anything , from all to nothing , as turns out to be best . This is a start in the right direction . It is the lack of co-ordination that has frustrated effort to this moment  --  one department canceling the effort . of another , sometimes to a standstill . If I were charged with the selection of a co-ordinator , I would try to find somebody who at some time in his life had organized , or managed , or led , or even co-ordinated something ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geniuses and real co-ordination and even the Executive Director , I would take the latter every time . Army organization principles are the oldest in the world . Change has been tried and failed . The trials have been the sternest possible in human experience , and by one channel or another it has been proved again and again in loss of blood , treasure and the existence of nations that the direction of about five , and not more than six , great heads of executive effort is the limit of human capacity and that an army , or even a division , takes an enormous staff . The present administrative organization of our Government is as big as several fielcfarmies . The new Emergency Council sot-up is , in my opinion and for this reason , impracticable . One hundred and forty separate and independent units reported to the Executive , who simply found it impossible to correlate ; them . To say that one Executive Director can now do what the President could not do is just to say that the former is a better co-ordinator than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopic vision of the truth . The President can make the lion lie down with the lamb and both be happy , and charm a canary out of a tree to sit on an eagle 's beak . I know because , figuratiVely , I have seen him do it , not once but many times . Indeed , I never saw him fail to do it . He is the greatest conciliator and co-ordinator the world has ever seen . You do n't solve a problem just by shifting it from one pocket to another pocket . The Executive Council was not fully effective , because there were too many units and the meetings were futile : The new Emergency Council , on thistecere , is worse because it is larger . ? " ; In order to solve any problem , you must break its big pieces up into little pieces , each not larger than one man can handle . Take the present Emergency Council as an example . It might be divided into any one of several groupings  --  for example . the following : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight fiscal or financial or financing agencies represented in this Council . 3 . Six agencies dealing with construction . 4 . Three agencies dealing with power , transportation and communications . 5 . Three emergency agencies dealing with agriculture , industry and relief , plus the Federal Trade Commission  --  four in all . Perhaps a better grouping , even though it might even recast some of the present administrations , would be : 1 . Fiscal and financial . 2 . Defense . 3 . Industry , including labor , commerce , agriculture and relief . 4 . Public works and property , including communications . 5 . Legal . 6 . Foreign relations . Either one of these groupings is as many as any one man can properly co-ordinate or administer . Now , if there were an Executive Director or Assistant President corresponding to each group and coordinating no more than six administrations or departments within that group , the High Executive Director or Premier or Grand Vizier might have a China-man 's chance , as a sort of chief of staff to the President  --  really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for presentation to the President , but no living man without a staff constituting a sort of composite brain for him could do even that job intelligently . But beautiful charts and organization plans and pious hopes , like the Michigan formula of " a punt , a pass and a prayer , " will not do the job . The crux of the whole problem is to enlist brains , experience and ability . I could not do it in the atmosphere that surrounded NRA . The President could for these higher functions , if he made the stark demand , but the combination of practical experience , rather than theoretical conviction , with intelligence and ability , plus the rare and peculiar mind without bias and attuned to unselfish public service as an end of itself and not as a means to personal or institutional aggrandizement , is almost an unknown quantity in this Coil ntry . There were such men in the beginning . England deliberately trains such men . We do n't seem to have them . Of course , if we have them not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as we have . 1 think I could name perhaps ten out of all my broad circle of acquaintance among leaders in the United States , However inadequate , what has been done is a good beginning . I have an idea that it is a single step in an evolutionary process . It is a good step and a necessary step , but it is not nearly enough . The Future of the Recovery Program AS FAR as NRA is concerned , I have said from the beginning that what is good in it will live  --  and ought to live  --  and what is bad will die  --  and ought to die . I believe that we have gone far enough to know what is good and what is bad ; and since getting completely away from it , I think I see much more clearly what ought to be done . In the first place , nothing whatever should or can be done until certain legal conflicts are completely cleared . 1 . Does NIRA so surely amend the antitrust acts that nothing done tinder the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the President can be construed as a , violation of antitrust laws ? 2 . Has the President any authority to impose a Code not proposed and agreed to by a substantial majority of an industry ? 3 . May penalties such as withdrawal of the Blue Eagle and fines agreed to by Code members be enforced , or may only statutory penalties be enmajority labor represen la-forced ? 4 , a maj tion maintain a closed-shop contract ? 5 . Is there a authority insider NIRA to write eomplefe wage scales into a Code ? 6 . Can the decisions of NRA tribunals be enforced ? There is only one way to clear this ground , and that is by amending the statute . Unless the conflict hetween NI RA and the antitrust laws is clarified , NRA eh nu Id he abolished . It does riot menu it I hing . Unless the other five uncertainties are clarified , there is not hing ahead but controversy and confusion . N1RA might to he completely re-Written to provide for purely voluncry associations of industries or parts of industries or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the President or individual or group agreements with the President . When such Codes or agreements are subscribed to by substantial majorities , both 113- number and volume of business , their provisions should become standards of fair practice for all individuals in such groups . and violation of such practices should subject . the offenders either to statutory or Code penalties , or both . But determination that such violation has occurred should be made by special NIRA tribunals , which determinations should lie enforceable in the courts or by withdrawal of the Blue Eagle . There should be two sets of tribunals  --  one for labor violations , one for fair-trade practices . Decisions of both should be enforceable in the courts . If the conflict between NRA and the Federal Trade Commission is composed , the latter can then be the final tribunal for fair-trade-practice disputes as a court of appeal from Code authorities . If it . is not composed industry would never go to sleep with its thumb in the mouth of FTC . The present NIRA does not permit employees to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many groups that badly need Codes  --  for example , nurses and salesmen . Also , if all labor unions had approved Codes the public would be better protected and the union would be far stronger . Unions , if thus codified , could be made responsible for their contracts . The Blue Eagle should be specifically authorized by statute and required to be displayed by members of Codes or agreements and on invoices and goods of such members . All public purchasers should require the Blue Eagle . Each Code or agreement should contain a stipulation that all its members will require the Blue Eagle on all its purchases . You ca n't make NRA effective without the Blue Eagle , and you ca n't keep the Blue Eagle if his legal authorization is in doubt . The statute should  --  as does the present law  --  require inclusion of its labor provisions in every Code or agreement , and it should not attempt to make those provisions substantive law because to do so risks the constitutional validity of the act . The labor provisions of Codes should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to institute , advocate , support , maintain or encourage any particular labor union or in any way to suggest , require , or influence , by term of employment or otherwise , any particular union ; except that where , tinder a Code or agreement , representatives of a substantial majority of all employers in an industry or part thereof have subscribed to a Code or agreement , and have agreed with representatives of a sub-stantial majority of employees in that industry or part thereof , then any such when approved bythoPresiagr cement , dent , may become part of that Code , even though it excludes any other form of labor representation thereunder  --  but this should not be construed to close any part of the industry to nonunion men . The effect of these provisions would be to encourage vertical industrial unions and codified industries . They would barn any company union influenced in any way by employers . They would not permit the closed industry . I do believe that , as a matter of expediency , two unions can not exist in the same shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention , to force any man to join a union . Therefore , I think that there should never be a shop closed to nonunion men any more than there should be a shop closed to union men . My suggestion would be that , when 60 per cent of men in a shop choose representatives , no other union should be recognized in that shop . The reasons for these views on labor will be fully developed in a later article . In my opinion , they would constitute a revolutionary improvement . I think there is nothing more urgent than to get the labor-management atmosphere cleared , and the suggestion of the joint committee , cited heretofore , is , I think , of vital and emergent importance . These suggested statutory amendments would settle the closed-shop and company-union controversies . In my opinion , no authority should have a right to impose a Code or an agreement  --  all should be voluntary  --  but , on the other hand , re-enforcement of the Blue Eagle would mobilize and concentrate public opinion to the support of Codes and agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in NRA , which could he had very promptly under a revised statute and which , I am convinced , can not be had in existing circumstances . I would put . a commission immediately to work on the question of wage differentials as between North and South , big cities and small towns , large employers and small employers , and I would hold a public hearing on their findings and make it a condition of continuation of any Code that these differentials be adopted . I would cut out price fixing in all but a few Codes , such as Bituminous Coal , and substitute therefor a system of price posting and publicity and a system of effective public tribunals where any complaint of cutthroat competition could he promptly heard , resolved and relieved . Most of the talk about productions control is moonshine . It is practiced in only a few industries , but when it is practiced , it is a stark necessity . If some legalistic and theoretical commentators knew a little something about the Codes they criticize , their advice would be worth something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the depression . That does not argue for nation-wide restriction of production or even any restriction beyond curbing gross excess , but there is need , and there will continue to he need , of the right to restrict where that becomes necessary to avoid ruin from unmanageable surplus . This subject will be discussed fully . I would immediately man and organize every Code Authority and abolish all Codes where prompt organization and effective administration could not be had . I would put experienced deputy administrators on Code Authorities as Government members . I would set up a system of Code tribunals , make their decisions effective by implementing the Blue Eagle and by providing for court enforcement of their orders where necessary . I would get an executive leader for NRA and abandon reliance on any committee or board for any administrative or executive action . So much for NRA . There are many other needed reforms , but this much would do the trick ; this much is necessary for any continuing operation of NRA . As to the rest of the recovery program , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article as a foundation for any hope of prompt success . I would segregate all emergency administrations from all permanent Governmentdepartments . I would assemble the heads of AAA , NRA , PWA , FERA , RFC and all emergency administrations into a committee under an Administrator of a Recovery Program . I would require the prompt submission of a co-ordinated six months ' schedule of action for all five agencies . After that was approved by the President , I would return it to the Recovery Administrator and make him responsible that it moved in unison . What argument is there for not doing this ? Only individual sensibili-ties . They have absolutely no place in this emergency pattern . What argu-ment is there for doing it ? Only that it is indispensable to prompt success . The future of the recovery program is certain . Time works for it . All eco-nomic influences tend back toward nor-mality . We can aid or retard them by political artifice . After a vivid experi-ence and many mistakes , I believe they can be aided by the suggestions in this article and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these suggestions  --  such as the restoration of confidence in fiscal policy  --  is necessary to avoid retarding them . But in spite of all we can do to hurt , and whether we do or omit all we can do to help , recovery will come , sooner or later , because the natural forces impelling it are stronger than any artifice . Nothing can stop a country of boundless resource and 125,000,000 unified , able and vigorous people within one tariff wall . It is just a question of whether we shall have to sit helplessly or act unwisely , and so wait for months or years or de-cades , or whether we can move with vigor and good economic engineer ing , and out the waiting time to half or a third or even a smaller fraction .
