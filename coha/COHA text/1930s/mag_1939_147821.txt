Looking on war-boom profits as birds in the bush , U. S. investors have quietly let stock prices sag . They have done so despite the fact that their birds in hand have been good plump partridges . In October and November the list of dividends declared by U. S. corporations has been longer and fatter than for two years . The New York Times last week estimated that by the end of November 1939 common and preferred stock dividends would be at least $86,000,000 above the total of $2,944,774,934 for the same period last year . <P> Prize dividend of the week went to the 2,100-odd stockholders of tight , plushy Christiana Securities Co. , organized to hold stock of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co . To Christiana 's well-fed stockholders went a last quarter dividend of $66.10 , running their take per share for the year to $136.60 , compared to $57.50 in 1938 . Unlisted , diamond-studded Christiana was quoted $2,740 bid , offered at $2,840 . For this super-blue chip , Christianans could thank their president , canny , beak-nosed Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 20,000 shares of Du Pont in 1915 , Pierre organized Christiana , poured in his and the holdings of other Du Fonts and friends on top of Coleman 's old bloc . Later he had to win a court decision to quiet the howls of dissident Du Fonts who thought the Du Pont company should have had a crack at Coleman 's holdings . <P> Among stocks that even small investors can buy , many a dividend was announced that was just as impressive . Cluett , Peabody &; Co. declared a year-end distribution of $2 , which brought its 1939 total to $2.75 , compared to 85 for 1938 . Wagner Electric , with $1 , ran its 1939 total to $1.75 , up $1.25 from 1938 . Anaconda Copper announced a 50 dividend which ran its total for 1939 to $1.25 , up 75 over 1938 . American Radiator doubled its 1938 dividend with an announcement of 30 . Midvale Co. , munitions subsidiary of Baldwin Locomotive works , declared $3.50 , putting its 1939 total at $6.50 , against $5 last year . <P> Extras were declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beech-Nut Packing , American Cyanamid , smart , well-run Chesapeake &; Ohio , Fairbanks , Morse . Dividends were resumed by Goodrich with $1 a share ( the first since 1937 ) , Hart , Schaffner &; Marx with $1 ( also the first since 1937 ) . Among the aircrafts , fat with military and commercial orders , many of 1938 's dividend rates were doubled and tripled , although many a dollar of profit was plowed back into plant expansion or laid up in reserve against the rainy day when the war orders will end . <P> There is no way of finding out how many corporate stockholders there are in the U. S. , but a fair guesstimate is 10,000,000 to 11,000,000 people . Bigger dividends of 1939 mean an average of upwards of $9 extra cash for this group . Including dividends declared during the last six weeks of the year , stockholders will have ten times as much extra spending money as the 7,000,000 savings depositors who next week draw $350,000,000 in Christmas funds .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
