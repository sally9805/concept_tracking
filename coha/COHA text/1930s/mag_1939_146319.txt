Last week an old man , fighting for breath , was wheeled into Chicago 's Mercy Hospital . Five grave doctors hovered over his bed , took samples of his sputum to type the pneumococci that had attacked him , samples of his blood to type him for transfusions . They covered him with an oxygen tent , inoculated him with pneumonia serum , fed him the famed pneumonia specific , sulfapyridine . Mercy Hospital 's Patient No. 1939-2468 was a very special case : he was the junior partner of America 's most famous medical team-Dr . Charles Horace Mayo . As it does with the greatest efficiency for 80,000 patients a year in the great Mayo Clinic at Rochester , Minn. , medical science did all it could for 73-year-old Dr. Mayo , who had been suddenly stricken while traveling in the Middle West . But his was a hopeless case . Few days later he was dead . <P> Although mourned by grateful thousands all over the world , " Doctor Charlie " was known as the co-organizer of America 's most streamlined medical factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , the Mayo Clinic , with its staff of 160 top-flight physicians , its swift conveyor-belt system in which invalids , nameless but numbered , are shunted from consultants to specialists to surgeons , has long been known as the Supreme Court of condemned patients . To thousands of forward-looking physicians , the 50-year-old Clinic , which long ago initiated group practice and dispensed with family doctors , stands as a model for medical practice of the future . And to admiring Europeans the Mayo Clinic is as peculiar a contribution of U. S. culture as the Ford factory or the Heinz pickle works . <P> " Brokennose . " Dr. Charlie took his earliest lessons in anatomy as a small boy . In the Sioux uprising of 1862 Dr. William Worrall Mayo , father of the two famed brothers , had helped capture 38 big , powerful Indians , helped string them up wholesale along the banks of the Minnesota River . Scientifically-minded settlers who wanted a dead Indian could help themselves . " Father got Chief Broken-nose , " wrote Dr. Charlie many years later . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I studied bones . " <P> In 1883 , five years before Dr. Charlie graduated from medical school at Northwestern University , a cyclone hit Rochester , injuring 300 citizens . Appalled at Rochester 's lack of facilities , old Dr. Mayo began to build a clinic . When it opened in 1889 , he was 70 and ready to retire , but both sons pitched in and divided the work between them . From the beginning they specialized in surgery . Will did abdomens ; Charlie , everything else . They worked up a large practice , went East and abroad for extensive postgraduate study , and in 15 years found themselves world-famous.
