For 30 years the same swart , devout Italian has delivered at the Vatican every morning the same sealed box , calling for it later in the day . <P> One morning last week he was intercepted by Italian police , commanded to open the box . <P> " Never ! " shouted the devout deliveryman . " Pigs of policemen ! You shall not touch with your dirty fingers the Pope 's bread ! " <P> Ensued a wrangle of three hours duration which ended only when the owner of the bakery patronized by His Holiness rushed down to the jail where his deliveryman was detained , unlocked and unsealed the box , exclaiming : " You see it is only bread ! " <P> " How do we know ? " countered the Fascist police lieutenant , a sturdy irreligionist like Signor Benito Mussolini . " It is clearly the duty of the police to break open these loaves and see if they contain bombs . " <P> Meanwhile what was the Supreme Pontiff eating for breakfast ? " We were obliged to send out hurriedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " inasmuch as the Holy Father 's frugal breakfast consists almost entirely of bread . "
