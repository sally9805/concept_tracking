One morning last week a group of Manhattan underwriters met in a light , breezy room of Morgan Stanley &; Co. at No. 2 Wall Street . That afternoon a Morgan Stanley syndicate was to begin selling the biggest foreign bond issue since April 1937-$25,000,000 in 4 % , ten-year Argentine bonds . Having already spent a rumored $50,000 to prepare the issue , the underwriters expected by noon to fix the price , parcel out the shares . At 11:45 the telephone rang . The Argentine Government , said a spokesman calling from Buenos Aires , wished to call off the deal ; " market conditions " were deemed unsatisfactory . Beyond that neither underwriters nor Government had anything to add . Henry S. Morgan , second son of Banker J. P. , simply said : ' ' It is now a dead cock in a pit . " <P> Argentina has a high credit rating in the U. S. It borrows frequently , pays its interest with the punctuality of a conservative savings bank . Remembering that last year a long-term Argentine issue went for 91 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term loan go for the price ( 93-95 ) the underwriters reputedly were planning to ask . <P> Although the sudden move was officially termed a postponement . Argentina might well seek the loan in Europe or at home , where its 5% bonds are selling at a premium .
