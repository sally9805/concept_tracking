Last week Rev. Dr. Frederic Sydney Fleming , in his annual report as rector of Manhattan 's rich old Trinity Parish , bluntly declared : " There is no part of the Church of Christ that has not failed lamentably in its witness and ministry in these recent years-the impotence of the Church is the worst failure . " Remedy offered by this lean , ascetic-looking churchman : " I seriously believe the Christian Church would once again bring salvation to the world , and begin to save its own soul , if it had the wisdom and courage to declare a moratorium on preaching for a period of one or two years . . . . <P> " For the most part sermons today are a very poor edition of ' topical ' homiletics , a brand of religious pep-talks , sailing forth for a transitory popularity under the guise of being inspirational . Truly the miracle of the Church is the patience of the laity . <P> " May we pray to be delivered from any more preaching campaigns calculated to arouse a benumbed and harassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusades , united preaching missions , citywide drives . . . these are samples of the inflictions that advertise their own delinquency . " <P> The Federal Council of Churches is planning a " Preaching Mission " of famed names to tour the U. S. next autumn .
