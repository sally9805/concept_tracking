Major drawback of Diesel engines ever since Rudolf Diesel built the first in Germany 42 years ago has been their heftiness . Although the oil a Diesel burns is cheaper than gasoline and its principle of igniting fuel by heat developed through compression is more efficient than using a spark , the strength required to withstand high internal pressures has made Diesels expensive as well as heavy . Engineers have long tried to make fuel savings offset weight , size and cost , but noticeable success was achieved only in Germany , where Diesels light enough to power the Hindenburg were developed . Last week , however , famed Engineer Charles F. ( " Boss " ) Kettering , who has long experimented with Diesels on his yacht , revealed that he too has found success . In Detroit , General Motors Corp. , of which Boss Kettering is the inventive spark plug , opened the first factory in the U. S. for the mass production of light Diesel engines . <P> General Motors made most of the 200 U. S. Diesel locomotives . In its new $1,006,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 to 6 cylinders , 22 to 160 h. p. ) lightweight Diesel engines at the rate of 50 a day , produce engines up to 1,200 h. p. at factories in Cleveland and La Grange , Ill . Secrets of GM economy are new light alloys and a production schedule using the same parts in engines of the same cylinder size . Suitable for direct drive operations on tractors , pumps , hoists and the like , the engines will also come in " packaged power " units ( engine &; generator teams ) to power theatres , parking lots , small industrial enterprises . All engine units are designed to be connected in tandem when extra power is needed . <P> GM predicts that its Diesels will operate at half the cost of gasoline engines and with greater simplicity . Impatient prophets who interpret this as a sign that automobiles with Diesel engines are close at hand will have to burn while General Motors fiddles , according to Boss Kettering . Said he , opening the new plant : " You would not buy a Stradivarius violin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same night . We have got a good fiddle , we know that , but we have got to do a lot of practicing. "
