Off &; on since its founding , Harvard has been conscience-stricken about limiting its educational facilities to a select few , felt impelled to try instructing the ignorant many . Earliest Harvard attempt at bringing education to the common citizenry was to round up promising Indians , only one of whom graduated. * Exhibiting a fresh burst of social consciousness , last week Tercentenary President James Bryant Conant announced that Harvard 's drafty classrooms would soon be thrown open to the public for a free course in U. S. history . <P> Chief study will be in books recommended in a syllabus to be issued next month , but the readings will be supplemented with lectures by visiting scholars and Harvard bigwigs , who hope to organize " reading parties " during the idle summer months . The course has been financed as a five-year experiment in adult education by Mrs. Charles Warren , wife of a famed Washington lawyer and Pulitzer Prize historian ( The Supreme Court in United States History ) who has served on Harvard 's Board of Overseers since 1934 . <P> *Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
