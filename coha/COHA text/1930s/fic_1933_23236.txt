MAGNA A STORY IN THREE PARTS BY ZONA GALE PART III ITER an interminable time she found the wall switch . Bolo was lying near his desk . His eyes were opened and he smiled at her . She ran to him , stooped to him , heard him say , " Sorry to be so . . . " and he said no more . She brought water and bathed his face , all the time murmuring his name and asking nothing . Then she took up the telephone , which was still chattering angrily , and called the old physician whom she knew to be Bolo 's friend . She sat on the floor beside Bolo , drew his head into her lap . His hand found hers and clung to it . " He does n't know about me yet , " she thought , " or he would n't do that . " So they waited in the still little room , with the stray shouts of merrymakers below and an occasional rocket blazing across the blackness of the window . She had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with him , in a dull misery of her own which seemed to have nothing to do with him . At length she heard a car stop , and the old doctor 's feet on the stairs . He came in , a ruddy man with heavy white hair and with black eyebrows so arched that they followed the curve of his black-rimmed glasses . " What have you done to him , young woman ? " he demanded . " Oh , it 's Magna . Well now , we 'll see . " After he had examined him and had given him a restorative , he lifted him to the leather couch . When in a little while Bolo could speak , it was to Magna that he explained , rather than to Doctor Barrows . " I went off the road on some loose gravel , " he said , " and banged my head . Things went round considerably all the way into town , but I came up here , and I sat writing a prescription  --  and that 's all I remember , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but I managed to knock the thing onto the floor and I must have dropped , myself . Then Magna came . " He smiled at her and stretched out his hand . " You may as well know about us , " he said to Doctor Barrows . Magna sat silent while Doctor Barrows burst out with surprise and congratulation . She said nothing , did not look up , and Bolo said " Poor child . I 've frightened her almost to death . What are you going to do with me , Doctor ? " " Hospital , " said Doctor Barrows . " Short order . We 'll have to look you over . Do n't worry  --  I 'll look after your practice . " He grinned at Magna . " You young people start out with nothing but an office , " he said , " and I honor you for it . Build up things together . " He talked on about the beginnings of his own practice . Lucy had been wonderful . She had made ends meet somehow . A doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many lonely nights . " But you 'll have a fine young husband there , " he said to Magna . " You 'll not regret your choice . " At length he gave Bolo an arm down to his own ear , put Magna in , and drove to the hospital . When they arrived , he went in to arrange for a room and left them in his car together . " I expect you wo n't object to these few minutes , " he said , " so I 'll not apologize . " When they were alone Bolo said nothing . He put his arms about her , and for a moment she slipped into the peace that his presence always gave her . Everything fell away , the unrest , the fever , the pain , and the joy of that day , nothing remained of all that she bad called ecstasy or misery . The old quiet , the old rest wrapped her round , " You came to me , " he said . " Magna , it was you . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need me I 'll always be there . " She said , " There 's peace with you , Bolo . Nothing but peace . " " And love ? " " Is love peace ? " she asked him . In the dimness of the car he searched her face . " Do n't you know that ? " he asked . She was silent , and he seemed content . She thought , " This is another world from Alec 's world . " Then the ache of her new wretchedness returned , and the peace that Bolo 's presence had for her was gone . Now Doctor Barrows was coming back , and there was nothing but to kiss Bolo and to reassure him that she was quite all right . " You 'll come first thing in the morning ? " he asked . She promised . She noted how heavily Bolo leaned on the Doctor 's arm as they went upthe steps . Suppose Bolo were to be very ill . Suppose he were to die . She amazed herself by bursting into passionate weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done Bolo such wrong . Regret was the greatest part of grief  --  regret for wrongs , wounds , injustices . Bobo had done nothing . He had come to her with open hands . " Well , well , " Doctor Barrows said , as he opened the car door , " it 's not so bad as all that , you know . At least I think not . There are some things that I do n't like about it , but he 'll have a night 's rest  --  I 've seen to that  --  and in the morning we 'll X-ray him . " " But he 'll be all right ? " " Let 's think so . He charged me again to ask you to come early . You 'll not mind waiting about  --  I really think you 'd better come . You own one whole man there , I see . " She was silent , too miserable to answer . Doctor Barrows said no more of Bolo . On the drive home he made only one observation , but this too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb , " he said , " and a family getting along in every one of them . Nice , is n't it ? " Sentimental old man , she thought ; and then wondered why a statement of fact was so sentimental . " Early to-morrow , " he said as he left her , " but do n't get there before Bolo has his breakfast , mind ! " She crept upstairs . She lay in bed with the inevitable wish to tell someone , to talk to someone of her situation . Who would this be ? She had friends of her own age , but they would enjoy this tangle , call it an adventure and " great . " One or two would understand , but they would say , " That 's a thing you have to settle on your own " ; and it was . It was so that she had always settled things . Her father and mother  --  sometimes lately she had ex-perimented by asking them for suggestions , but always her father would lecture her for her ways , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude by wondering what this generation was coming to . As for her mother , she seemed so fearfully grown up . She would advise actions well-suited to a woman of fifty , but not so practicable for a girl of twenty . No matter how sweetly talk with her father or mother began , it always ended in storm . She knew that they loved her , but that was a fact which she had to take for granted when they were advising her , for her father did not fail to grow impatient and her mother to be too philosophic , too adult . Especially now , with her father 's prepossession in favor of Alec , Andris was as remote as a mountain . She went over the list of the others : Great-aunt Elizabeth , Aunt Marty , Aunt Taffy  --  well , just possibly Aunt Taffy . She felt that Uncle Jasper might have something for her if she could bring herself to talk with him . Uncle Sven would just assure her that everything would be all right , and Uncle Joel would laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her thought went back to her mother . If Ethna had not been her mother she would have Iiked her as a person . It was only the attitude of criticism , the mother-power of admonition , which stood in the way . Yet when she found Ethna moving about the dining room in the morning , she tried it . Magna said : " Mother , when you were in love . . . " She stopped . This seemed not quite the right approach to one who presumably was in love with her lord , and had been so for nearly thirty years . " When one is in love , " Magna went on , but she had no idea what to say . Not " Is one peaceful , or excited ? " That was n't it . Not " Is it just a great contentment to be with one person , or is it a terrible excitement and almost a suffering ? " No , that was not a thing one could ask . Her mother repeated her words . " When one is in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very foolish  --  I know that . " She set some dishes on the table and went out of the room . So Magna said no more . Ethna and Andris had finished breakfast and had gone over to the shop when Alec came down . Magna was sitting over her coffee . Alec entered , kissed her , sat down beside her . His hands were strong and veined , and when he picked up an object one feared that he would crush it . He took hold of her chair arm and sat looking at her broodingly , his brows a little drawn . " How much right have I to ask you questions ? he demanded . " As much as you choose to take , I suppose , " Magna answered . She did not meet his eyes , but again she was seized with a trembling , with some terror which still was joy . " I could n't sleep last night , " he said . " I was at the window when you went out alone . I was there when a car brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , of course I wondered . All this is so new that it seems queer , asking you . But  --  I did wonder . If you 'd rather not  --  well , Magna , I did wonder . " " You 'll have to know , " she said and she told him what had happened . " You see , Alec , " she ended , " Bobo did n't come here last night , and I knew there was something wrong . Suppose I had n't called . . " " Of course , of course , " Alec said absently . She thought , " Then he does n't care . " He caught his breath and clenched his hands . ? " you 'll have to go to see him to-day at the hospital ? " " Yes . Yes , of course . " " And he does n't know ? " 411 , " No. " r " Magna ! " Alec cried . " He thinks you 're engaged to him ! " She looked down , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good heavens , I suppose you are , " Alec said . He stood up and began pacing about the floor , his breakfast untouched . " You must tell him at once  --  at once ! " he cried . " But I ca n't tell him now , " Magna said . " He 's ill  --  we do n't know yet how ill . I ca n't go there to him with such a message as that ! " " Then you 'll sit by him and talk says to you so that he 'll keep on thinking you love him ! " She cried , " Alec  --  Alec ! I 've loved him enough to be engaged to him . Do you imagine that I can unlove him all in one minute ? What would you think of me if I could ? " " But , my God , " said Alec , " then do you love us both , or what ? " She stood with her hands at the throat of her reddish dress , not looking at Alec as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrouded in green . " When I 'm with you , " she said , " I feel as I 've never felt in my life  --  alive and happy and more . You frighten me  --  and every word that you say shakes me to pieces  --  and yet I love it , and I want you to go on and I want never , never to leave you . Is that love ? " " You know that that 's love , " said Alec . " What else . . . " She put out her hand . " Shall we hoe like that always ? " she asked . " Who ever did live like that always ? And when that was gone  --  whatever it is  --  what should we have left ? I do n't know You  --  you do n't know me . " " But think of the joy of finding each other out , " he exclaimed . " What if it did n't last ? We should have had our thrill . " " Is that what love is ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ! " Alec cried and had her in his arms . But then he moved away from her and said in a tone strange to her : " Is that what you feel for him , Magna ? For this  --  Bolo ? " " Oh , no , " she cried , and now the look in her face was one strange to him . " When I 'm with him I feel so still . " " But you 're happy with me ? " " Of course . But with you I 'm frightened  --  and I want to be fright-ened . " " Look here , " said Alec , " most people never feel anything except what you feel for Bolo  --  a tame , pleased feeling that passes for love . You and I have the real thing . Magna  --  surely you know that . " She said nothing . He said roughly : " My way would be for you to go to him with the truth . He 'll guess it anyway  --  you 're too fine to pretend to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and then , seeing him look at his watch , and knowing that he was hurrying off to see about bail for Earl , who had been taken to the county jail that morning , she cried : " How good you are to us , Alec ! " " I 'm not , " he told her . " It 's only that I 'd like to pull out anybody that you want to help . " He looked back and growled , " Even this Bolo . But I 'm just saying that to make you love me more , " and left her . While she was hurrying to the hospital she thought : " It 's never like this . They always love either the bad ' man or the good ' man . These men are both good ' ? they 're both wonderful . " She ran through the streets and she was thinking : " If a woman loves her husband the way I could love Alec would she ever leave him for the kind of love I have for Bolo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She did not finish that . At the hospital she found Doctor Barrows with Bolo , and she waited below until the Doctor joined her . " Do n't be so worried , " he said . " You look positively ill yourself . That wo n't do . Why , yes , Bolo 's puzzled us some . It was a nasty Mow that he gave himself on the head ; it 's going to hear watching for some days yet . How the Lord ever let him get into town last night , I do n't know . He might have pitched into the steering-wheel and gone to pieces for fair . But he managed to get to his office . " He peered at her . " If you had n't called him , and if he had lain there all night , " he said , " I would n't answer for what would have happened . " Magna said nothing . " You can go in there now , " he said . " He 's in twenty-two . " She did not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afraid . You 'll find him all right . I guess what he needs the most now is to see you . " He went oft down the corridor , smiling in his belief that a lovely chapter of romance was about to be enacted in twenty-two . Bolo looked as if he thought so too when Magna tapped on his door and entered his room . From his bed he stretched out his hand to her . He said nothing , but lay looking at her , as if to see her were enough . She stooped and kissed him , saying desultory and unimportant words . " Magna , Magna , Magna , " he said at last , and his eyes were filled with tears . At this she was terribly alarmed , fearing that someone had been there already and had told him . But soon she saw that it was only that he had so wanted her to be there . It was strange , since he lay here so nearly helpless , but even now there was nothing about Bolo which would permit one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who seemed never to need or to allow sympathy . He lay there tall , brown , alert , good-looking , and no one could say " I 'm sorry . " Instead he almost made one say " You 'll be quite all right , you know . " His vigor and poise seemed really to be admitting this first . Magna had brought a book , hoping that she might read to him and avoid the talking she dreaded . But Bolo wanted to talk . " Do n't read yet , " he pleaded . " Tell me about yesterday . Where did you go ? " Magna tried to tell him where they had driven . She found herself saying what she could about the beauty of the day , the country , the flowers . She told of those whom they had met and talked with , of the orchards , the roads ? of anything , it seemed , but that for which he was waiting . At length he said : " Alec seems rather fine . " This she admitted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was interesting . " What did you and he find to talk about ? " he wanted to know next . Well , the Hebrides . Magna had learned much about the Hebrides , about the mountains of Harris , where Alec had lived as a little boy , and about the interesting geology of the islands . Bolo grew restless under this . " Did n't you say anything ? " he demanded . " Nothing worth repeating , " she told him faintly . " Did you  --  did you stay all day ? Where did you lunch ? " She told him about " Grandmother 's , " dwelling at length on the antiques in the place . Weil , but what had they seen ? Had n't she taken him into the town , shown him the parks and the library ? " Oh , deliver me from the park systems of all towns , " she said laughing . " No  --  we looked at the country . " " I might have met you , " said Bolo . " I was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I kept thinking , " Bolo went on , " ' There she is going about with a chap younger than I am  --  clever , with fine manners , and Europe sticking out all over him . He 's got an established business and money . Magna 'll fall in love with him , ' I thought . " " You absurd thing , " said Magna . She began to turn the leaves of her book . " If only you had waited , Magna , " he went on , " and not got engaged to me . You see ? Here comes along this fascinating chap . " " I 've seen lots of fascinating chaps , " Magna said , still turning the leaves of her book . " They 're as common as stars . " " I was thinking all that and hustling hack to town to get to your house , when I ran off the road . " " Oh , Bolo . " " It was to get to your house that I struggled into the car and kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , you darling , you called me . I thought it was you . I got my head up off my arms and tried to answer  --  darling , you were right there when I needed you  --  and you always will be . " " We were hurrying back into town , when we heard the newsboys crying out about Earl , " said Magna . " What about Earl ? " She had meant to keep this from him , but now she rushed into the story , thankful to have something to turn the talk . She told of seeing Earl atthe station , wrung from Earl 's story all that she could of news . She even told what Earl had said when they saw him . At first Bolo was silent . Then , " It makes love seem terrible , " he said . " It Ly terrible , " said Magna . " No , not love , " Bolo said , and his face kindled in a way that she knew . " How does it go ? ? ' Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when frightened it is not disturbed . When put upon it returneth love . ' What 's that to do with madness ? " " Bolo , " said Magna , " say that again  --  that about love . " He repeated the old lines . She listened , looking in his face . And what had that to do with terror and anguish and a power that shook and devastated ? She kept on looking at him so strangely , so deeply that he cried , " Magna  --  what is it ? We know all about that . What is it ? " " Nothing , " she said , and at that moment , absurdly enough , remembered Great-aunt Elizabeth . She went into a rollicking account of the previous day 's visit there , of the defiances of Uncle Joel , and of Great-aunt Elizabeth 's , " I do n't love him . I 'm used to him . " " Does love get like that , Bolo ? " she asked . " Not ours , " he said . Now she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't let her stay , and she opened her book . She spent the morning there , reading , or sitting quietly when she thought that he was asleep . But he slept little , for he would open his eyes often and lie looking at her with such tenderness that she could have cried out . It was fearful to think that the word that she could speak would quench all that light in his face . A doctor from the city was to arrive that afternoon , but she promised to return towards dinnertime . When she came back , two or three physicians were with him , and she would have gone away if Doctor Barrows had not insisted that she wait . " He wo n't sleep if you do n't come and say good-night to him , " he said , " and he needs sleep . What do they think about him ? You would n't understand , and it 's my belief that neither do they , But he was mighty close to a concussion . " She slipped in to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touched her face . " Magna , " he said , " I love you with my whole soul . " He looked at her wistfully , but she did not speak , so he said , " Could n't you say that for me ? " She repeated it , " Bolo , I love you with my whole soul . " In the corridor , as she walked to the outside door , she was weeping . A woman in a blue bathrobe , who had often passed Bolo 's door , now said to her : " My dear , is it hopeless ? " " No , no , " said Magna . " Not that . " " My case is hopeless , " said the woman . " My husband came to-day and they told him . I did n't mind for myself  --  hut he never could stand things that were a hurt to me . I do n't know what he 'll do . " " You have been married long ? " Magna asked . " Twenty-four years , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other . It 's terrible when it ends . " " Yes , " said Magna , " it 's terrible when it ends , " " I 'm glad for you that that need n't be , " the woman said and walked on . At home the dining room was bright with cheer . Ethna had ready a delicious dinner , and Andris was in his highest spirits . Here was Alec all but in the family , and Andris had had an exceptionally good day of trade . Besides , Alec was back from havingarranged bail for Earl if he was to be admitted to bail . Even Earl 's case seemed to Andris not so very black . The four sat about the table . The lamp hung low and centered its light upon these savory dishes . Magna was glad to be away from the depression of the day , the odor of the hospital , the ceaseless ting-ting of the signal bell for the staff . Alec was done with hours of disagreeable duty , and Andris and Ethna , in the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put away , there remained but the hour and the food . The dinner table became a little isle in the midst of dark waters . " I 'm not worth the sawdust to stuff me with  --  eh ? " said Andris , apropos of nothing . He laughed inordinately and tried to make the others laugh  --  and even succeeded . " A good meal , " he cried . " I will not sell my wife so cheap as I had planned . " He looked so hopefully from one to another that they all smiled , and Ethna said , " Andris would like to be a cut-up if only he could find out how . " Then as they all sat together later in the evening , Great-aunt Elizabeth came in . " I came to congratulate you two young folks , " she said . " Your father telephoned me the news , Magna . I must say , I think it 's a sensible thing . And what more can I say than that ? " " So I say , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing that ever has happened to me , " said Alec . " I feel sorry for all the rest of the world . " " Yes , " said Great-aunt Elizabeth , " Yes . I was just coming by the hospital and I could n't resist looking in to see how Bolo took it . " " You did that , " said Magna . " Oh , but he does n't know . " " Well , he does now , " said Great-aunt Elizabeth . " I did n't know that he did n't know before . He never let on when I told him . " Apparently with no impression made upon her by this that she had done , this woman went on ; " Lydia came down the road to my house this afternoon , telling everybody again that Jute is coming home tonight . Him twenty years in his grave , mind you ! Do n't it beat all how love can last ? " Early next morning , before the household was stirring , Magna slipped out . She would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait in the grounds , and so avoid her family and Alec and their questioning . " It was the best way , sweetheart , " Alec had said , the night before . " It is best that he should know at once . You can send him a letter telling him the rest . " No one could be more magnanimous than Alec over a fallen rival . She passed the ugly building occupied by human misery and thought of the night just passed and its hours of suffering  --  and of Bolo , whose suffering was at her hands . She thought of the woman in the blue bathrobe and of her husband who knew that this was the end of the life together of which they had not had enough . That husband 's suffering could not be so deep as Bolo 's . How that woman would despise her if she knew . And Doctor Barrows  --  and everyone save Andris and Ethna and Alec , and the sort of friends who would say , " Wow , what a mix-up ! This is the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flexible . She went through the office without question and up to Bolo 's door . The door bore a white card : " No Visitors Please . " She was standing with frightened eyes in the corridor when Doctor Barrows came . He greeted her kindly  --  evidently he knew nothing of Great-aunt Elizabeth 's visit or of her news . But he looked grave . " Bolo is much worse , " he said . " There 's been some change  --  all his resistance has left him . No  --  I could n't let you go in , Magna . " He hesitated . " I expect you ought to know the truth , " he told her . " Bolo has asked that nobody should come to see him  --  nobody . Not even you . " " Did he say that  --  not even me ? " " He said that  --  yes , my dear . " She turned and stared at the closed door . " There 's no accounting for the vagaries of a sick person , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't look like that , my child , or we 'll have you in here too . " She went back to the house , and there was Alec , waiting for her . It was all over now . She had made her choice , and Bolo intended to abide by it . No more effort to decide , no more speculation about the matter  --  nothing but Alec and the future with him and the satisfaction of her father and mother . Very tender of her , silent , even absenting himself , Alec tried in every way to soften for her the time . Her father , determined to pass over the whole matter as desirable , took his awkward means to " liven her lip , " talking to her incessantly , even making his jokes for her . But Ethna said little . " There 's some puddings that fingers do n't flavor so good , " she said only . Earl 's trial had been hurried on , with a speed greater because of the indignation of the people . In a measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of Earl . But of this Magna was hardly aware . She bmew , however , that Alec had thrown himself into the situation " as if he had been a regular local Pethner , " Uncle Joel said to all . On the day of the trial , in the week following , all the Pethners save the young children went to the county-seat to attend . Magna drove over with Alec . She was touched by his care of her . When she was with him all that had happened seemed inevitable , but when she was away from him her misery held her . " Magna , " he said , " you 're not the way you were when I first met you . " " How am I different ? " " You 're more silent . I believe this fellow Bolo was more to you than you know . " She said , " Perhaps I 'm wondering how you can feel sure of me . A girl who will leave one man she 's engaged to will leave another . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't love and take the one she does . . . " She thought , " It 's Bolo now who has dropped me , it seems . " Every morning she had telephoned to Doctor Barrows and had had the same report : " Not much change . Still keeping him quiet . No , no visitors . No , Magna , he has n't asked for you  --  just be patient , " kind Doctor Barrows insisted . When they reached the courtroom they found it crowded , but seats had been kept for them by the family . Andris was there , turning about , scanning everybody and whispering from behind his hand . Ethna had refused to go . " I heard lots of things in my life that I did n't want to hear , without running after them , " she said . Earl stood lip abjectly , head and arms hanging limply . His great loose mouth moved as he made his replies , but his face was inert . He had none of the bravado of the courtroom hero , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole sordid story came out , and the only words that could be heard clearly over the room were Earl 's reiterated defense : " I loved her . I was crazy about her , I tell you . I did n't want her out of my sight . " The lawyer for the prosecution had a score of tales of those who had been mad for love and had killed the object of their devotion . This man , nasal , sneering and with a scanty beard , stood with his back inordinately straight , and declaimed : " Love is a madness . A man in love is beside himself  --  does not act normally or sanely . A larger percentage of murders are committed for jealous love than for any other cause save only greed . Love is a greed  --  a greed for possession . Gentlemen of the jury - Magna listened . " Love a madness , love a fever . " " Do you believe that ? " she asked Alec , at the recess . " Anybody who loves deeply knows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Magna ? " She was silent . She was hearing in another voice : " Love watcheth . . . when weary it is not tired , when frightened it is not disturbed , when put upon it giveth for distresses only love . " All through the night these words beat upon her brain . Out of the fever and the fog of the last days came Bob'so face , and the silence that was his , and the peace that was for her when she was with him , these were upon her like his hands . " I have been mad , " she thought , " I have been as mad as Earl . " The next day she went once more to the hospital . The " No Visitors " sign was gone from number twenty-two . She tapped and pushed open the door . The clean bare room was empty , its white spread drawn tautly over the unoccupied bed . Doctor Barrows was not about , but at the hospital office they told her that Doctor Marks had been gone for three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked . At his hotel they said that Doctor Marks was absent and had left no address . At length she found Doctor Barrows . He was all consideration , but he said : " I 've promised him not to say one word of his whereabouts . He is better ? I see him  --  but he does n't want to see anyone . " " But Doctor Barrows . . " " Now see here , " he said , " you look like a ghost . Go and see your Aunt Taffy Pethner . She was here to see him the day he went away . " " He saw her ! " Doctor Barrows flushed . " The course of true love ? " he began . Magna wanted to say " Pish-wishwish , " as her mother so often said . " But he must be better , " she insisted , " or he could n't have left the hospital . " " Ile left whether or not , and with or without his doctor 's orders , " said Doctor Barrows . " Bolo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is , he should n't have left yet  --  he 's by no means on the safe side , and he knows that . But he would go . Magna ! " Doctor Barrows hesitated . " It 's a kind of professional secret , " he said , " and I should n't tell you . But after the No Visitors sign was put up he never took his eyes off the door . I think he hoped you 'd disobey the sign and come in . But when I asked him if he wanted to see you , he always said no . You all beat all , " he concluded . " Well , your Aunt Taffy may know something . " In Aunt Taffy 's little living room , Magna sat , looking about her . The shabby room of a lonely person  --  what was more pathetic ? And what secret did Aunt Taffy hide away ? Was it true that years ago her father had pushed her down those stairs because she had wanted to go on the stage ? Little Aunt Taffy came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great haste , her too-yellow hair in its youngfluff about her worn face . She sat down , her head held high between her too-high shoulders , and the over-large hands of the cripple twisted awkwardly about her crutch . " What 's the matter , Magna ? " she said instantly . " You do n't look like the happy engaged girl I expected to see . What is it ? " Magna said , " Aunt Taffy . Do you know where Bolo is ? " " Bolo ! Are n't you engaged to Alec ? " " But do you know where Bolo is ? " Aunt Taffy spread her large hand over her forehead and closed her eyes . " I knew it , " she said . " That Hebrides man swept you off your feet . I know his kind  --  I know his kind . " " I must find Bolo . " Aunt Taffy spread her large hand over her mouth  --  she seemed to talk with those hands . " You 're mighty lucky , " she said , " to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm not free , " said Magna . Then Aunt Taffy 's last words arrested her . " You never did get free , Taffy ? " she said . Now she dropped the " aunt " and called her Taffy , as if there were no years between them . " When I saw him coming across the Oak Opening that night , " said Taffy , " I knew the kind of man he is . Oh , fine and honorable enough , you know  --  but with something about him that makes all women follow after him . And Lord help them that he goes after ? if they love somebody else . ' There , ' I said to myself when I saw him , on the night of the picnic , ' is Eric Burns , to the life . ' " Magna was silent . " You 've heard , likely enough , " Taffy went on , " that my father pushed me off a high place to save me from going on the stage . Yes , but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Eric Burns . He was one of the men that all women follow , like 860 IL.kRPER 'S MONTHLY MAGAZINE your Hebrides man . I was mad about him , as they say . Yet it 's not he that I 've gone all my life regretting , but David Mason , that I was engaged to at the time . " Taffy was silent , remembering David Mason . " Do I know where Bolo is ? " she repeated . " How should I know ? " " Tell me , " said Magna only . " I 've no pride , now . I have n't thought things out , Taffy . I do n't know  --  anything . 1 only know that I must see him . " " What if I promised him that I would n't tell where he is ? " " Oh , Taffy , " said Magna . " I 'm so miserable . And it may mean my whole life . " " And his , " said Taffy thoughtfully . " Though I 'm not so sure . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind get stubborn , they 'll sometimes stand in their own light to the end . " Taffy considered and said : " As it happens , I did n't promise Bolo anything . But I think he trusted me not to tell . I wo n't tell . I 'll just go with you where I think he is . Mind , he may not be there . Can you go as you are ? " " Yes , yes ! " " Without a bag ? We 'll be gone a night . " " Put in some things for me . " " Well , " said Taffy , " you 're in earnest . Magna , have you broken with Alec ? " " I 've run away ! " Taffy said no more but went to make ready . Magna sat looking about the room . David Mason . Eric Burns . Then the old Calvinist who was Taffy 's father had " embraced his perdition " not alone because of a distaste for dramatic art , but because of Eric Burns . Yet to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that better for Taffy than to have lived here , lonely , disfigured , down theyears ? But what of David Mason and that home with its " never-lighted fire " ? She sat at Taffy 's desk and wrote : Dear Alec , This that we have is not love as I want love to be . I may never find it again , but I shall take nothing less . Good-by , Alec . Magna When she saw her post the letter Taffy said , " I wanted to tell you that our trip would be of no use unless you had burned your bridges first . " " It may be of no use anyway , " Magna said . As they left the house poor Aunt Lydia Pethner was just arriving . " I came to tell you , " she said affably , " that Jute is coming home to-night . He 's been away for a long time  --  some say for twenty years , but I do n't think it can be that long . It was only the other day that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he wo n't go away any more . " She went on , smiling , into the house . She had come to stay with Taffy now . " ' Many waters can not quench love , " said Taffy . " Aunt Elizabeth would say it 's habit  --  but she knows better . By the way , Joel is pretty sick . Let 's take time to ask about him . " They stopped at Great-aunt Elizabeth 's door and , since no one came to answer their ring , they entered , in the Pethner way . On the couch in the sunroom little Joel lay , and his vast wife was sitting beside him and lifted a wan face to the visitors . " He 's a little mite better , " she said , " I have n't left him all night . When he 's sick he 's so patient he nearly kills me . " She followed them to the door when they left . " He thinks the world and all of me , " she said , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , you 're just used to him , Aunt Elizabeth , " said Taffy . " I never said such a thing ! " cried Great-aunt Elizabeth . The town to which Taffy bought their tickets was not fifty miles from Farway , a resort town , much frequented They inquired at the post office , where addresses were given out as freely as mail , and they went up the little river to a hotel not far from that one which the office named . Doctor Marks , Taffy learned , had already gone to the grounds where an Indian powwow was held nightly . " I ca n't go there with my crutch , " said Aunt Taffy , " hut I shall not find a mite of fault if you go . " The night was gray , with a white moon lighting the clouds . The boat that ran up to the pow-wow quenched its lamps on moonlight nights , and it did so to-night , running between high green river-banks . Magna sat on the boat alone , completely surrounded by family units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a chief stood with folded arms in the prow of the boat , and his baritone rolled over the water in the Winnebago love songs . This was to be , evidently , a pow-wow built up for the tourists ; but it would have been all the same to Magna now if she had been directed to a volcanic eruption at which to meet Bobo . When she reached the grounds , the performance had already begun . It was enacted in a natural amphitheater among the rocks . The slopes were lighted with torches and set with rows of rude benches , and on the low stage Indians of various tribes were dancing to monotonous music . Magna found a rock a little way above the benches and began her search along the rows of faces for Bolo. lighted clearly by the torches , by the great bonfire blazing on the stage , and by the flares of red fire set off among the rocks , all the people were clearly visible to her . Seen so , intenton the spectacle beneath them , these men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of good will . All types were there , humanity cast in its role of audience . All but one . The thin , brown , eager face of Bolo eluded her . Again and again her look went round the benches ; and then , at the farther end of the oval , seated alone , in the topmost row , she thought that she saw him . She made her way among the rocks , as fearful as any prowling Indian of loosening a stone which should fall clattering , or of cracking dead branches . As she went she heard the voice of the announcer explaining the action taking place on the stage . " Minne-waha , the Indian maiden , who for love of a white man left her tribe and her kind and went to live in the far north . Thereafter she was called by her tribe the Mad-woman . " " Perhaps all those in love are a little mad , after all , " Magna thought , footing it over the rough ground in the dark . " But at least there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point above the uppermost row of the benches . Now she could look directly down on Bolo , seated alone . De had chosen a place in the shadow , at not a very good vantage point , and thus he was seated at a little distance from the others . Magna 's heart was beating so that she thought Bolo might hear and turn inquiringly . She thought , " Where is all this peace and quiet that I have felt when I 'm with him ? " She began the slow descent to the place where he sat , and she thought : " What if he should look at me and say not a word . " She stepped safely down among the rocks , holding to the saplings as she made her way to that topmost bench . Then she stepped over the plank that was the bench and sat down beside Bolo . He turned and looked at her , looked deeply and as if he could not believe what he saw . He looked back into the dark and returned to her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Magna . . . " and looked about her , and half rose . " ' Who is with you ? " he stammered . She said , " No one . I came alone . To find you . " Now his look searched her through and through . He wasted no words . " Where 's Alec ? " he asked . She answered , " I have n't an idea . " " But he 's here  --  here with you ? " " No , he is n't , " said Magna . " I 'm here alone . I came to find you , " she repeated . Down on the stage they were dancing , a slow rhythmic motion , to the low monotony of music . Magna leaned to Bolo , answered the look in his eyes , and said : " It 's you that I want , Bolo . Keep me with you . " Still he was silent , searching her face . " Unless you do n't want me , " said Magna . He answered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh my God , Magna . " Now she reminded him miserably , " ' No Visitors Please . ' " " But I 'd heard  --  you know what I 'd heard , " he told her . " From someone whom I thought you must have sent . You had spent that whole day with me ? out of pity  --  when that chap . . . " She looked at him bravely . She said : " My dear , it 's you that I love and it 's you that I want . Is that enough ? " Afterward she remembered that he had said nothing at all , but that merely he had drawn a deep breath , as if he had reached the end of a journey . They sat watching the stage , where the dance was going on  --  Indian braves snarling and bounding about and then squatting before their chosen ones , shouting and becoming drunken with their shouts and with their tom-toms . ? There was love that was madness , that was fever and fear and distraction and storm ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of the sun . Once more she felt the quiet and the haven of being with Bolo . " Love watcheth . . when weary it is not tired , when frightened it is not disturbed , when put upon it giveth love . " Pethner came to the door of his shop and looked up the street . June , and everything in his shop of a freshness unequalled , and yet not enough people would come to buy . " The people of this town , " he said to Ethna , who was arranging one of the windows , " do not deserve a first-class shop , such as mine . " " But we give it to them in any case , you and I , " said Ethna , laying out candy bars in formation . Pethner lounged in the doorway , languidly watching her . " It is Alec who has saved us , " he said . " I 've been thinking : since Earl is to go to prison , we shall have all the more help from Alec , likely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will let us have , " Ethna reminded him . " All we need , " cried Pethner . " One thousand  --  two thousand . Have I not told you that he said so last night as he was leaving our house ? And a man who will say that with Magna turning her back on him like a maniac  --  he is a prince of the first water , Ethna . " " You mean a prince of the blood , " said Ethna . " Water or blood , it is all one if the money comes in , " said Pethner . " But that Magna . . . " He turned back to the street , a hand twisting in the awning ropes ; and there were Magna and Bolo , walking towards the shop . " Yah ! " said Pethner . As she looked on her father and mother it came to Magna for the first time that now she could not help them to provide for the shop as they had hoped . But this seemed like the matter of a dream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come with Bolo and me to-morrow to be married ? " she asked . " Yes , " said Ethna instantly . Pethner struggled , but his longing to make a joke overcame him . " Me go to a wedding , " he said . " I would not go to marry your own mother there . " He smiled at Ethna , and she smiled at him , and showed a dimple , in complete understanding . " Bolo , " said Magna , " even when we get very used to being together , I shall love you . " ( The End ) THIS YEAR OF OUR LORD BY GILBERT MAXWELL I AM sick in my soul of the poets who sing Of the star in the sky and the bird on the wing , While Life lies down in a filthy shroud And can not be spoken about aloud .

A canker is gnawing the roots of my heart That such as these can shiver and smart Under the thorn of mock despair While children suffer for light and air . . . .
