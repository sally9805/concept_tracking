THE GLOBE A STORY BY BENEDICT THIELEN FI ER hands folded over her stomach , her lips slightly pursed , Mrs. Merkel nodded her head in confirmation of what she was about to say . " Of course I know it 's none of my business , Charlotte , and goodness knows I do n't believe in interfering in other people 's affairs , especially their children ; you never get any thanks when you try your best to help people , they never seem to take things in the spirit you mean them but . . . " She took a deep breath and glanced across the room , " but I must say I do n't see what Ralph wants to go and spend his money on a thing like that for . " They both turned their heads and looked over at the globe standing in the corner beside the fireplace . Charlotte nodded her head . " I know . I thought it was sort of foolish too . As a matter of fact I said so and then he went and got mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she leaned forward in her chair . " So he got mad , did he ? Just because you said ... and I bet he paid a lot for it too . Those antiques always cost a lot . I must say I never could see why just good new furniture that would n't collapse when you sat on it was n't every bit as good , better really than those antiques that you have to pay a lot of money for them and then the first time you sit down just as like as not they go and collapse on you . Now if I . . " " And the funny thing was he carried it home all the way himself . He bought it in some place over on Second Avenue and . . . " " How much was it ? " " Only fifteen dollars . That 's not much for an antique , I guess , but .. . " " Well , he probably had to take it to the station in a taxi . That would cost say fifty cents at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought it of course . " They both turned their heads and looked again at the globe . " But what would he want to do that for ? What 's he want to do : study geography again ? My goodness , if it was something useful . . . " Charlotte shrugged her shoulders . " Well , you knowhow he is . He 's always looking at those maps of his and . . " Mrs. Merkel clicked her tongue a few times and shook her head . " What I had to put up with from your father sometimes ! I do n't know . . . " She looked at Charlotte intently for a few seconds . " Men are funny , Charlotte . " Charlotte nodded her head . Mrs. Merkel sighed . " And then to think what you could have bought with that money . Fifteen dollars  --  more when you count the taxi fare , that was probably a dollar or so . Say sixteen dollars . I remember your father always used to be doing crazy things like that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat and there he 'd sit night after night making that silly little boat , one of those model things , you know , that does n't even go in the water ; night after night he 'd sit there , hardly paying any attention to me when I 'd try to make some conversation instead of just sitting there like a dummy , and all the time he could have been making something useful ; you know how it is around a house , shelves for the kitchen or maybe a rack for shoes like they have , you know with a place for the heels to catch on so they do n't slide off , they sell them now at Macy 's for a dollar eighty-six , I think it was , but in those days you had to have things like that made , and of course we could n't afford .. . " " Remember that doll 's house and all the furniture he made me ? " " Yes , sure , of course . Oh , I 'm not saying your father 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real clever and if he 'd ever had any sense about business he could have got a long ways , but that silly little boat , why . . . " Charlotte laughed . " Yes , " said her mother , " it sounds real comical now , but it was n't so much fun for me , let me tell you , night after night . . . " " I do n't ever remember seeing that boat . What happened to it ? " Mrs. Merkel laughed and shook her head . " Oh , dear ! " She laughed again . " It seems funny now . But it was n't funny then . No , sir . Why , one day your Aunt Sarah was there with little Albert . . . or no , wait a minute , it was n't Albert at all , it was Sterling ; you remember Sterling . Goodness how could I have thought it was Albert , why Albert was n't even born yet , that shows how time flies , do n't it , why it seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of fussy that day , crying and jumping up and down like they do , and so just to keep him quiet I gave him the boat , I gave it to him to play with and of course he had to go and drop it and the whole thing just sort of fell to pieces . " " Goodness ! " " Yes , I never thought it was such a flimsy thing as all that , although I 'll never forget how hard it was to dust around it , it was a terrible dust-catcher , you can imagine . But to make a long story short : was your father mad ? Say , honest , I do n't know when I saw him so mad . I said to him , ' Why , good heavens , ' I said , ' I did n't know it was as important as all that and . . . ' But he just went on yelling at me and so finally I started in to cry and then he stopped and when I did n't stop crying why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Merkel paused for breath and they were silent for a few moments . Then Charlotte said , " Still , I do n't see what he wanted with that globe . " " No , but then you never can tell . " Charlotte laughed , looking over at the globe . " It was a funny thing though . When he came back with it , lugging it all the way up from the station ( I was using the car that day ) , why , there were a lot of people here , a lot of our friends , and everybody started in to kid him about it . Did you meet Ellis Proctor ? No ? Well , he 's a scream , and he said maybe we could play football with it , and Phil Strong , he said , no , it would be better to cut holes in it for a face and then use it on Halloween with a candle stuck inside of it . " " That 's a good one . " " Yes , but the best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now but he used to be an actor , and when everybody else had finished wisecracking he just stood up and pointed at the globe , you know the way they do on the stage , and recited something from Shakespeare . I remember we had it in school . It was from the ' Tempest . ' " " Oh , yes , " said Mrs. Merkel . " I do n't remember just how it goes . You know , it 's that part that starts out : ' We are the things that dreams are made of 7 SY " Oh , yes , sure . " " I do n't mean it starts that way , but that 's in it . Anyway , there 's something in it about ' the great globe itself . ' And that was the whole point of it , you see . They all got a big kick out of it . Shakespeare . . " " Imagine ! Did you say he used to be an actor , Mr. ? what 's his name ? " " Cook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pretty good too . His wife . . . " " What 's his wife like ? " Charlotte looked down at the floor for a moment and then up at her mother . " Oh , I do n't know . All right , I guess . " Mrs. Merkel laughed . " You do n't sound very crazy about her . " " Oh , she 's all right . I do n't know , though . I do n't think she understands him , really , but I suppose she 's all right , only I think she 's kind of dumb . She never says much . Or just shy , maybe . I do n't know . " Mrs. Merkel nodded her head sympathetically . " Yes , it 's sometimes hard to tell . Still , in the long run , what I always say is if somebody 's got something interesting to say the chances are they 'll say it . They wo n't just sit there like a clam and if they do , why you can be pretty sure they just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , that 's all , except in the case of a man like Coolidge of course , and then that 's a different story . " " Oh , yes , of course . Well Ralph seems to like her . . . " Mrs. Merkel 's face lighted up . " Oh , that so ? " " Yes , he seems to think she 's got a lot of brains . I ca n't see it myself , but she was the only one out here that day that was n't making fun of that thing  --  that globe . She claimed she liked it , so naturally . . . " " Hmmmtrd " Mrs. Merkel looked across the room at the globe , squinting her eyes a little . " That was clever . So she said she liked it . . . And besides when men say they think some other woman 's got brains you want to watch out . Nine times out of ten it 's not brains they think she 's got but something else , if you get what I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good excuse , it makes everything seem all right . ' Oh , yes , we just sit around of an evening and talk about books and Shakespeare . ' Well , maybe so , but . . . And then if she has got brains she 'll use them and before you know it , likely as not , you 're being fooled and everybody knows about it but you . " Charlotte laughed and said , " Oh , I 'm not afraid of anything like that . Ralph is n't that sort . " Mrs. Merkel looked at her , her eyes still narrowed , focussing , as they had been when she looked at the globe . For a few seconds they said nothing , then Mrs. Merkel relaxed and sat back in her chair . " Of course you know best , " she said . Charlotte looked at her . " What do you mean ? " Mrs. Merkel raised her eyebrows and gave a short sigh and looked round the room . " Did you have those curtains the last time I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you ? " " No , " Charlotte said . " But what ... " " Where 'd you get them ? Macy 's ? " " No , Bloomingdale 's . What do you mean , I know best ? " " What ? " Mrs. Merkel looked at her vaguely , as if she were trying to remember something that had happened a long time ago . " Oh . . . why , just that you know best , that 's all . Goodness , I would n't think of suggesting .. . " " No , really , Ma . " " Why , I simply mean if you 're that sure about Ralph , why I 'm glad of it , that 's all , it 's a fine thing and I 'm glad of it , if you 're so sure as all that , that 's all . " " She 's not especially pretty , " Charlotte said slowly . " She . . " " That do n't mean a thing , " Mrs. Merkel said decisively . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever saw . . . well , as I say , it 's none of my affair . How much did you have to pay for that dress you had on the other night ? You know : the little green chiffon one with the little jacket . " " I do n't see what a man like Larry , like Mr. Cook , could see in someone like her . " " Well , there you are , that 's just what I mean . There must be something if .. . " She looked at Charlotte sharply . " Are you and Ralph . . . I mean do you and Ralph . . . are you . . . uh . . . happy together ? . . . you know . " " Why , yes . Yes , I guess so . " Mrs. Merkel sighed . " It 's not so easy sometimes , is it ? I mean  --  well , love and all that . It 's all right , I suppose , but it 's not really what it 's cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . no , " Charlotte said , slowly . Mrs. Merkel looked out the window , smiling a little . Then she said , " Has that Mrs. ? what 's her name , Cook ? Has she got any children ? " Charlotte shook her head . " Oh , " Mrs. Merkel said . " Why ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I just wondered , that 's all . " " She 's been =riled once before , " Charlotte said . Mrs. Merkel frowned . " Oh , that so ? Divorced ? " " No . He died . " " Ohl That 's too bad . " " Yes . I feel sorry for her . " " Yes . That 's a shame . " There was a pause , during which Mrs. Merkel cleared her throat . Then Charlotte said , " I guess maybe Larry felt sorry for her too . I mean perhaps that 's why he married her . " " That happens a lot . More'n you 'd think . Men are funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . " They looked at each other , then both of them , at the same moment , gave a short laugh . " I see you got an electric clock , " Mrs. Merkel said . " That 's what I tried to get your father to get but he would n't part with that cuckoo clock . Just because his sister sent it to him from Germany . It loses about twenty minutes a day too , but every time I say anything about it he gets mad . You know the way he gets , spouting German at me , as if I understood a word of it . " Charlotte laughed and said , " Well , I suppose everybody has crazy ideas .. . like that globe of Ralph 's . " " Yes , but men seem to be more stubborn about those things . You know the way they get when they make up their minds about something they want  --  un-reasonable . " They looked at each other understandingly . " And then when you 're dead tired Mrs. Merkel sighed again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my goodness , I should think it was about time for them to be getting here . Whatever happened to that friend of Ralph 's , you know , the fellow that works in the bank too ? " " Murph ? " " Yes , that 's it . Mr. Murphy . What ever happened to him ? " " Oh , he 's still around . I saw him a while ago . " " I thought he was sort of crazy . He talked about a lot of crazy places he 'd been to that time I met him . China and Europe . " " Yes , he 's been all around . " " I remember he talked about a lot of outlandish places , " Mrs. Merkel said . " I wonder what Ralph sees in him . " " I do n't know . He thinks he 's great though . He just sits there by the hour and listens to him when he gets going about all those places . Of course it 's very interesting but you get sort of tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered . " " Wondered what ? " " Oh , I do n't know . " She looked round the room . " That 's a pretty picture you 've got over there . Weil , I do n't know , do you think he 's a . . . a good influence for Ralph ? I mean , do n't you think he puts a Iot of his crazy notions in Ralph 's head , maybe ? " She looked at the globe . " Oh , I do n't know , " Charlotte said . " Well , I just wondered . Men are funny that way . Oh , look , there they are . " There was the sound of steps on the porch and a key being turned . The two men laughed as they came into the hall . Mrs. Merkel raised her eyebrows and looked at Charlotte . " That 's a good one , " Ralph said as they came into the room . Mrs. Merkel turned her head partly as they came in and talked over her shoulder . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show up at all , We were just beginning to give up hope . Ralph , did he make you go to that place where he goes to drink beer again ? I should think . . . " Mr. Merkel laughed and said , " By golly , Ralph put up an awful fight all right , but he lost in the end , eh , Ralph ? " He winked at Ralph and then went over to Charlotte and kissed her . " Well , " said Mrs. Merkel , " we were just admiring that thing , that globe of yours over there , Ralph ; it certainly is quite an antique . I had no idea you were going in for collecting antiques now , my goodness , you certainly must he coming up in the world . The next thing you know I suppose you 'll be going in for collecting oil paintings . Well it certainly is nice to be able . . . " " Oh , it did n't cost much , " Ralph said . " Say , that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He went over and looked at the frame in which the globe was set . " That 's good joining they did here , you know it ? So , so . . . . Let 's see now . . . My goodness , it 's a big world , ai n't it ? " Just then there was the sound of wailing from the floor above . Charlotte got up . A moist benevolent smile came over Mrs. Merkel 's face and her eyes dimmed slightly . Mr. Merkel looked up from the globe , smiling . " Well , can we see the young man , now he 's awake ? " he asked . " Not yet , " said Mrs. Merkel firmly . " Of course not . " She followed Charlotte out of the room , walking softly , a look of mystery and conspiracy on her face . Mr. Merkel and Ralph looked at each other awkwardly for a few moments , then bent down together over the globe . " Yes , sir , " said Mr. Merkel , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Ralph ? " Ralph looked down at the globe . He gave it a turn with his hand . An ocean swam before his eyes . His hand was on a continent . " It certainly is , " he said . " Yes , " said Mr. Merkel , " it 's a big world . " He pointed his finger . " Look , there 's where I come from and now ? " he traced a path across the ocean with his finger ? " now I 'm here . " He looked up and laughed . " It 's funny , ai n't it ? " " Yes . " Mr. Merkel shook his head and gave a sigh . " It 's too bad . You think maybe some day you 'll see a lot of those places . But you never do . You think maybe later , when . . . " Mrs. Merkel called to them from upstairs . They went up . " Well , well , well , here he is , " said Mr. Merkel , going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here 's the little son of a gun ! " Ralph stood by the door , smiling . Mrs. Merkel rocked slowly back and forth in a chair , her hands folded roundly over her stomach , watching her daughter and her grandchild in the small warm room , feeling complete and satisfied with the close warm comfort of the world .
