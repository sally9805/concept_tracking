No great novelty in U. S. restaurants are the little cards which read " NO TIPPING . Our waiters are glad to serve you without gratuities , " and which usually add gentle preachment about the dignity of man . But news would be any nation where tipping was against the national law , big news if that nation were France , tourist playground of the world , synonym for good food and good service rewarded via the outstretched palm . Last week Lon Blum , reaching the end of his first year as Premier-a year which he said was notable for " the restoration of human dignity " in France-was out to make just such big news . <P> Two months ago his Government abolished the droit de tablier ( " right of the apron " ) , the fee that waiters and washroom attendants had to pay their employers for the privilege of working for tips . <P> Still more revolutionary , on its face , was last week 's close vote by the Chamber of Deputies ( 267-to-265 ) approving a bill for the complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gambling establishments and watering places . <P> This was a triumph for the extreme Leftists , who hold that tips are humiliating . Declared Minister of Labor Jean Lebas during the heated Chamber debate : " The worker should not receive as alms what is his right ! " Under the bill , which faces strong opposition in the more conservative Senate , workers caught soliciting or accepting tips would be penalized . The money would be made up to them , and more , in regular wages obtained under the workers ' Blum-given collective bargaining contracts . The cost would be passed on to the public by 15% or 20% price increases at restaurants , cafes , cinemas.
