IT HAS been called unpleasant names . It is the latest " Pied Piper of Hamelin , " luring youngsters from the path of righteousness . It is today 's violent villain , playing a role not unlike that of liquor during prohibition . When the old-timers get together to indulge in a bit of headshaking , disapproving tongueclicking , and general what-is-thisyounger - generation - coming - to prognosticating , it is swing that often gets the censorial spotlight . They call it a dangerous stimulant , barbaric , blatant , and raucous . Yet here it is . The most popular diversion in colleges . The favorite sport of youngsters . The important subject in dancing schools . The best seller in popular records . Not long ago a swing concert drew 24,000 people out to Randall 's Island , near New York City . Swing has even invaded Carnegie Hall . I am undeniably prejudiced , but I see nothing wrong with swing or with is young fans . Each age has its dance . Each dance is an expression of the times . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waltz expressed the beginning of man-and-woman freedom of the 19th century . Swing is a reflection of a restless , tense world . One ca n't expect this brittle age to produce anything but a brittle dance . But because it may astound some people by its apparent wildness , because other people can find no beauty in its free syncopation and teasing rhythms , it does not follow that there is anything morally wrong in swing , or that its devotees are " critters of the divil . " Young people always need an outlet for physical energy . Here is a strenuous outlet in a strenuous age . Swing has excitement , swing has freedom . Many of today 's boys and girls seem to need that excitement for blowing off steam . Swing is free ; one can dance to it in a personal and individual way . Lack of convention appeals to the youngsters . A chance to put their own ideas into a dance makes the dance interesting . Swing is not wholly unlike Grandmother 's " Paul Jones . " I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thousands of youngsters I am convinced that swing is no more to them than a game ? a good strenuous game after eight hours in an office or good solid study in a classroom.Swing became fashionable largely through the enthusiasm of the colleges . I think I have played at more college dances than anybody . I 've seen the students and their friends in Yale , in Princeton , in Pennsylvania , in Amherst , in Bowdoin . I 've watched them at formal and informal affairs . It is true they go after their good times with enthusiasm and abandon . They do like life and action . It may seem wild , but it is n't . It 's a strange thing . There is , no doubt , a terrific college craze for hot tunes . I have written some of these tunes , and they have been popular in the colleges . Students like my " Dipsy Doodle , " " Satan Takes a Holiday , "  | " Study in Brown , " " Stop and Reconsider . ' ' Yet , while hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , the colleges still continue to be fond of the love ballad , the boy-meets-girl , sweet melodies . The moon is still there outside the dance hall . The lilac bushes still are sweet to them . And for romance they still want romantic songs . I get five times as many requests for " Star Dust " as for a novelty number . In recent months I have noticed a change in the style of dancing itself . When swing first struck the youngsters , they danced with exaggeration . I remember playing around Philadelphia once where they did something called " The Cherry Blossom . " It was roughhouse . But now college students are getting down to dancing rather than throwing themselves around . It is swing now ? not sling ! To the shade of Johann Strauss the new dances may resemble the witches ' wobble ; but to my eye there 's now much grace in them , a great deal of beauty , a good amount of youthful charm . Swing is a young people 's dance , however . When Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? ! IVE mentioned before that swing dances allow scope for individuality . As this dancing becomes more of an art and less of a tumble , genuine styles develop . Colleges are now working out their own dance forms . I notice the differences as I go from one college to another . One thing all colleges agree on : currently the shag is the most popular dance . Why ? Perhaps because it 's easy to do . It goes with almost any step . As a dance it is a development of all the dances of the last 15 years . And one can shag even on a crowded dance floor ! There are really two kinds of swing ? jam swing , called " sandblasting " in some colleges , which depends on improvisation by the'members of the band : and dance swing , or what I call " lifty " swing , which depends mostly on teamwork by the band and on the arrangements of the tunes . I began as an arranger . I used to arrange for Glen Gray , Tommy Dorsey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entitled to my opinion that the colleges are beginning to turn away from jam swing and are taking more interest in good arrangements . Both kinds of swing are jazz with a certain lift in it , a certain piquant bite , an off-the-beat surprise rhythm . In a sense all swing is a return to the original purpose of jazz ? a free style of playing jazz tunes ? freed from some of the overelaborateness of symphonic jazz . College fans ask me how one can tell good from bad swing . Anyone with a natural feeling for it can soon learn by listening . One soon turns away from crude effects and wah-wah tricks and begins to appreciate musicianly playing and arrangements that are made with original ideas , and taste and tact . I 'd like to emphasize that I believe good arrangements to be the lifeblood of good jazz . This is true whether arrangements are improvised or , as I prefer them , worked out beforehand . Consider that , in a piece of classical music , all the notes are there . In swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it exciting or banal . In other words , the swing arranger really creates the music . Somewhere I read a good comparison . Swing arranging can differ like two artists ' paintings of the same countryside . The finished paintings will show the same scene , the same cow , the same barn ? but what a difference in the approach , in the color , in the excitement , in the whole feeling each painting gives you ! That 's arranging . College boys and girls ask me how to form their own swing bands . I like to hear that question because it shows that the boys and girls will keep the interest in. modern music alive . Well , first of all , you have to be a good musician . You must be able to play with absolute ease . If the notes bother you , you . ca n't lift them and toss them around . Make no mistake about it ? swing playing demands real musicianship , split-second precision , absolute accuracy of pitch . But ? more than that ? swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you have n't . Neither study nor hard work will give you that natural swing feeling . That 's why swing musicians never can explain to others how they get their results . Form your band , I say , with just a few musicians ? six or seven as a start . More make an unwieldy band , at least in the beginning . The most important instruments in a swing band are the first sax and the first trumpet . ( Keep that in mind too , when you listen to a band . ) If the : are good , you 're a long way along . The : start with stock arrangements of populer tunes . When you have mastered those you can work out your own style . Buy recording machine , if you can , and make , records of what you do . Then play the records back ? and be hard on yourself . OFTEN I am asked , " What will swing be like a year or two years from now ? " Who can tell ! 1 do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has come a long way since that day , almost twenty-five years ago , when a blind Negro named Stale Bread was supposed to have played the first jazz in the streets of New Orleans . And if I have to be a prophet in my own game , I would say that future swing will be less wild . There will be less noise and more beauty , less stomping and more lift . fewer tricks and better construction . That 's always the way when an art grows up . Its rawness disappears . And I do think swing is an art . A good bit more gaudy than the classical Muse , but fascinating nevertheless . Perhaps what I said thus far may convince some that swing is not an evil influence on young people . In any case , I should like everybody to read this para-graph : " Like an electric shock , the notes animate all hearts . Men and women , young and old , acknowledge the power of tit ' , music over the ears and soul . The young men spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the willowy languos - and lightness of their movements , the voluptuousness of their attitude . . . Partners tease and entreat and pursue each other by turns . Suddenly the music stops and each dancer shows his skill by remaining absolutely motionless , bounding again into full life as the orchestra strikes up . . . The supple swaying of the dancers fills the spectator with ecstasy . . . strange throbbing , deepening notes ? assonances unknown to music but curiously characteristic , effective and intoxicating . " Is n't that a good description of swing ? But it happens to be a description of an . old , old Spanish dance ? the fandango . The description is in Vuillier 's " History of Dancing . " Today the fandango has attained the dignity of the ballet . Forty-nine years ago it was used in that superrespectable , super-delectable Gilbert and Sullivan operetta , " The Gondoliers . " I do n't believe it ever did hurt anybody . do n't believe swing will .  |            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
