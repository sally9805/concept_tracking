In 1927 , the year slight , greying Josephine Roche became heir to the minority interest of her late conservative father , John J. Roche , in the Rocky Mountain Fuel Co. , blood was spilled on another page of the grim history of Colorado 's mine wars . To Vassar-educated Miss Roche , who had spent 19 years as a social worker , that was bitter : six diggers had been killed in a strike riot within sight of the gaunt tipple of Rocky Mountain Fuel 's Columbine mine . <P> Long an outspoken opponent of the nonunion policy of the Colorado coal field , she got ready to fight it . Within a few months she bought the interest of Denver Capitalist Horace Bennett and gained control of $10,000,000 R. M. F. Then to Josephine Roche 's office was summoned Rocky Mountain Fuel 's general counsel , the late progressive U. S. Senator Edward Prentiss Costigan . To Senator Costigan went leaders of Colorado 's struggling mine unions . Late in the summer of 1928 they signed a famed document : the first mine union contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To establish industrial justice , substitute reason for violence , integrity and good faith for dishonest practices , and a union of effort for the chaos of present economic warfare . " <P> It worked . Colorado union men bought R. M. F. coal , as a contribution to the high wages and good working conditions that Josephine Roche 's workers enjoyed . R. M. F. diggers were R. M. F. salesmen , and once , when the company was threatened by a price war by nonunion mines , went without pay for 2 months to lend $80,000 to the management . <P> But while R. M. F. did better than others because of its union policy , the whole Colorado coal industry grew sick . The year that Miss Roche took over , a pipeline which had snaked its way from the natural gas fields of the Texas Panhandle went into operation . Owned jointly by Standard Oil of New Jersey , Sinclair Oil and Colorado Public Service Co. , it knocked the spots off the coal business . In 1929 , 9,934,000 tons of coal were mined in Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Meanwhile , under the pressure of the New Deal and public opinion , the entire Colorado coal field had been unionized . Paradoxically , it hurt Rocky Mountain Fuel . Union men who once had demanded R. M. F. coal , were now willing to buy from any union mine . R. M. F. sales leveled off , ran a deficit year after year . <P> For a few years Josephine Roche and other officers lent money to the company to pay interest on its $3,971,000 bonded debt . Some five years ago Miss Roche stepped out of the presidency to become Assistant Secretary of the U. S. Treasury , turned over the job of running the company to able J. Paul Peabody . Last year , after his death , she returned to the job , later asked bondholders to take interest cuts in their R. M. F. 5s . They refused . <P> Last week , unable to effect a compromise that would keep R. M. F. out of ruinous reorganization , she stepped out . Old Vice President John R. Lawson , onetime president of Colorado 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . Into Rocky Mountain Fuel 's offices in Denver moved William Taylor , president of Cleveland 's Coal Mine Management Co . His aim : to reorganize R. M. F .. put it back on a paying basis . Colorado mine union leaders talked to Reorganizer Taylor , said they were satisfied no change in labor policies was intended .
