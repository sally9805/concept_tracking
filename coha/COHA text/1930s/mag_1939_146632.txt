This week in the little French village of La Napoule in the Alpes Maritimes , townspeople and fishermen streamed across the Place Henry Clews , through the great gate of the Chateau de la Napoule , to the carved and vaulted mausoleum within . They went to pay their respects to their benefactor , buried just two years . Four thousand miles away , in Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum , some of Henry Clews 's countrymen also paid their respects , by viewing a memorial exhibition of his sculpture . <P> Henry Clews was a poor little rich boy turned artist . Born and bred in a big Manhattan house , son of an English-born international banker , Henry went through the regular paces of an idle and talented young man . He tried his hand at Wall Street and at playwriting , married , divorced and remarried , turned to the expensive indoor sport of sculpture . He put on seven shows , drew from the puzzled critics only such faint praise as " decadent , exotic , bizarre , sensational .

Henry and his devoted second wife ( beauteous Elsie Marie Whelen of Philadelphia ) moved again , this time to the idyllic seclusion of an 8th-Century fortress-monastery at La Napoule , on the shores of the Mediterranean . There they set about to create their Never-Never Land . Self-conscious Aristocrat Clews carefully restored the chateau and gardens , stocked the whole place with white birds and animals ( to his white pigeons he had tiny flutes fastened , which whistled musically as they flew ) , worked when he felt like it at sculpture , writing , painting . La Napoule 's villagers regarded his wealth , his largesse and his talent with open admiration ; celebrities from far and near beat a path to his door . <P> Clews 's Jekyll- &-Hyde; sculpture falls into two utterly unrelated groups : 1 ) Rodinesque portrait busts and vitriolic caricatures ( of the human race in general or friends in particular ) , generally in bronze ; 2 ) grotesques-like Jan , King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green porphyry . Always a competent sculptor , he showed to best advantage when he chiseled the monsters of his own imagination . <P> Last week Mrs. Clews , now living in La Napoule , where she is writing her late husband 's life , announced that her sculpture-encrusted Chateau de la Napoule will be permanently thrown open to the public some time this year , expose to the tourist gaze the medieval riches , actual and Clewsian , of the archwayed , sarcophagied , fountained interior .
