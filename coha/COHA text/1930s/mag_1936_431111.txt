 | Steel : A Giant Awakened Condensed from Today Marc A. Rose FULLY CONSCIOUS Of their might , giants are prone to become sluggish . But right now there is nothing slow about the rate at which the giant steel industry is adopting new ideas , new formulas , and new tools . There has been no such upheaval since the Bessemer process of making iron into steel by blowing air bubbles through the molten mass revolutionized the industry in the decade following the Civil War . From the topmost executives down to the rank and file , every one of the 430,000 men who help make steel is aware of progress . That itself is part of the change . The Bessemer operator knows just what use each batch of steel is intended for . " This batch is for shotgun barrels - 100 tons , " said one to me : " Next will be a batch for rifle barrels , quite different steel . Then one for brake drums on automobiles . After that a couple of hundred tons of screw stock  --  steel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screws . Special ? Everything 's special now . " At the open-hearth furnaces the crew knew that an automobile maker would be experimenting with the new molybdenum alloy they were turning out ; he hoped to improve the springs on his car . The " office " had told the men all about it , and as a result they were keenly interested . To keep men interested in their jobs is good management . Time was , not so long ago , when steel was just steel . If you bought steel , you expected nothing better than an approximation of your needs . Steel was the synonym for massiveness , its symbol the bridge girder . Nowadays the automobile fender and the tin can are better symbols ; a surprising amount of steel - last year 43 percent of it - is now produced in strips and sheets rolled to exacting specifications . The typical president of a steel company used to come up through the mills and know how to make a lot of steel , of uniform quality . Now he is much more likely to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who used to be a good entertainer and spender of the Diamond Jim Brady school , is now a bespectacled scholar , a metallurgist . I ran across a a936-model steel salesman the other day . He grad-  | uated from M.I.T. three years ago and then spent a year in the mills , working in one production department after another . Next he went to the laboratories - the United States Steel Corporation alone has an army of 1400 men engaged in research = and then spent four stiff months in the training school for salesmen . He had just been working six weeks in a mattress factory . " They 'd been having complaints about their springs , " he explained . " No wonder . They were not only using the wrong kind of steel wire but they did n't treat it properly . I suggested a new-formula steel and gave them some suggestions on how to coil springs which we worked out from our own experience in our wire mills . " And do n't think that mattress springs are a far-fetched illustration . If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails made to be used only in the heels of shoes worn by workers in chemical plants . Keeping the customer happy means , today , making 83 different kinds of steel for automobiles , whereas in 191 1 there were only 1 a kinds so used . And there 's a genuine advantage in each kind . Some alloys give greater strength for equal weight and bulk ; others will not corrode on exposure to acids or hot gases . There are alloys that show no wear after long use . Others take a " deep draw , " i.e. , cut freely under tools and so can be more easily stamped into elaborate shapes . The term " alloy steel " is convenient , but sloppy , for there is no steel which is not an alloy . Iron by itself is too soft for most uses . Carbon and manganese are the cheapest hardeners but in too great proportions make the compound brittle . Nickel , more expensive , toughens steel remark - , and the use of nickel steel for armor plate and propeller shafts is commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chromium adds strength without much decrease in ductility and is the cart horse of the stainlesssteel industry . Whereas most steels weaken under heat , tungsten alloys actually get stronger ; one of their uses is for the cutting tips of highspeed tools . Molybdenum increases the ability of steel to withstand shock and fatigue . Other elements are being studied , as are also the electrical properties of alloys . Alnico , for example , is an aluminum-nickel-iron formula which makes the best permanent magnets yet produced ; they support 6o times their own weight . A new resistance wire - the wire that glows in your toaster and bathroom heater - will stand 100 o0 hours ' use at 260o degrees , a temperature at which older types melt . This means better electric  | furnaces for melting gold , firing pottery , annealing stainless steels , and heat-treating steel . This last process has succeeded in giving certain carbon steels double their former ductility without appreciably decreasing hardness . There is a special steel for saxophone springs and , to meet the needs or whims of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicknesses , widths , and finishes . For installing new equipment and modernizing old , the industry spent $140,000,000 last year ; this year it is spending $200,000,000 , and is ready to supply 50o products in 100,000 grades , shapes , and sizes . Steel 's new life began 10 years ago with the building of the first continuous mill to roll thin strips and sheets . Before , chunky billets of steel were put , by hand , through great rollers , like clothes wringers , each trip under the rolls reducing the thickness a little more . The new mills are automatic as well as continuous . I saw one of the newest of them : it is something short of half a mile long , rolls sheets 8o inches wide , and cost $20,000,000 . Soon there will be 21 of these continuous , hot-rolling mills . But they are merely the most conspicuous of the many improvements being made . There are also , for instance , cold-rolling mills to form " U 's " and " L 's " and other alphabetical shapes which give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so it is . But it does not necessarily spell technological unemployment . Activity at present runs at something like 5o percent of the industry 's ingot-making capacity . Employment , however , is back nearly to the 1929 peak . The explanation , say steel men , is partly the increasing trend toward small , special orders , partly that a large number of employes are required for new finishing processes - shaping , forming , and so on . Thus , to meet the demands of the modern age , the giant steel industry is taking three strides . It is using new tools , it is developing new products , it is changing personnel and psychology . So great is the stirring in the industry , amounting almost to a rejuvenation in the case of some of the older companies , that even the hardiest prophets do not attempt to predict what the industry will be 10 years from now .
