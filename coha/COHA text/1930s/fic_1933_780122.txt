can sit while you tell us all you know about the young lady and her father ? " " Indeed and there is , " replied Mrs. O'Brien heartily , succumbing at once to the charm of the tall American 's manner . " Walk yerselves right into me sitting-room . " She bustled through the long , dim hallway into a bright enough little cubby-hole at the end . Here everything , though old , was neat and shining , while a red checked table-cover gave a cheery aspect to the place . Several small paintings hung on the wall , and a life-size crayon portrait of the late O'Brien stood on an easel near the tiny , glowing fireplace . They seated themselves before the blaze , for , although it was just past mid-July , the evening  --  like so many in England  --  was raw and cold , and the warmth from the small grate most acceptable . Strangely immediately settled back , his long legs wound twice around each other in a favorite contortionist attitude , with the left foot hooked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes thoughtfully narrowed . " Now then , " he began , " when did the Ravenelles come to you ? " Mrs. O'Brien cleared her throat impressively . " ' T was eight years ago come Januwery , " she said slowly . " I mind well the day  --  a bitter cold one , with rain and fog to boot . Along about nine of the evening come a ring at the bell , and when I opened to it , there was three persons fair blown into the hall . Half-froze they was , and wet . Himself was alive at the time , and when he see that one of the men was a cripple , nawthing would do but that he must carry him in , in his great strong . arms , to our bit of a fire . Old Ravenelle , it was , Mr. Lawe . Just as you see him now , but a fine handsome man for all of his twisted limbs . ' Tether was short and dark with a foreign look to him , though he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had on his face , and O'Brien  --  who 'd follied the sea as a lad ? said he 'd the look of a sailor . The third was the young child , Miss Rilla , a poor half-starved lookin ' creature , but even so a sweet , pretty way with her . "  |  | She paused to wipe her eyes vigorously , and Lawe stirred impatiently in his chair . " Well , " she went on , " the dark man explained  --  for what with and and all , the others was too bad off to speak  --  that ' t was passin ' he 'd been when he come on the two poor souls of them ' smirked up in a doorway , Mister Ravenelle proper beat and the cluldecn cryin ' so pitiful that he could do naught but stop . The old man grabbed at him , and says he , For the love of God find us shelter , ' he says , for I fear I 'm going to die . ' Well , the sailor man , a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the street , and ' t was any port in a storm , so to speak . So he brought them and left them . Nor he would n't stay for a cup of Ica and a drop of rum , even there 's naught like a bit of tea and rum to heat a body after the cold  --  and we never see him again . " " And Rilla ? " questioned Lawe eagerly . " Well , I give the poor lamb some hot milk , and she fell asleep In the great chair there , and betwixt O'Brien and me we got the old line up the stairs to bed . He was a main sick man , gentlemen , but he pulled through , and they 've been here ever since . They could n't pay much , so I give them the top floor back , though with him a cripple and all ' t was a rare bad climb . But ' t was all I could dh- , and never yet have I raised the rent on them , though the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' t is all a Ely can do to keep soul and stummick together . With the bit they ate , and what-not , they was easy to care for . Prompt pay , too , though it fair hurt me heart to see the creatures hand out their guinea a week from their little old pokkie-book . It seemed like they got letters from some place  --  Folkestone , I believe  --  for some years , and there must have been a bit of money in them , I 'm thinkin ' . For finally they stopped comin ' , and then one night Miss Rilla  --  she was risin ' sixteen then and sweet as the dawn - comes in on me and says , Mrs. O'Brien dear , ' she says , ' I 've got to work . There 's no more money , ' says she , and there 's malting poor Father can do . Now where shall I go ? ' Well , rntivincn , the good Lord pervides . And this time he pervided Ilic lady typewriter on the second floor front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machines , along of the other lodgers complainin ' , the way she kept them from sleepin ' at nights . Well , she 's left long since , and I 've never let another of the contraptions enter me house . But she served her purpose , gentlemen . I rejuced her rent a tidy bit while she learned Miss Rilla to work . And that 's the story , gentlemen . That 's all I know ! " She settled back with a long breath . " Thank you , Mrs. O'Brien , " said Strangely , who had listened patiently , as was his invariable custom with garrulous witnesses . " You have told your story very clearly . And now we come to July 17th , the day , or rather the night , of the disappearance . I understand you saw Miss Ravenelle at eight o'clock , and were , as far as we know , the last person to see her that night . " " True , sir , " replied the woman quickly , with all the volubility and willingness to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that she was carefully choosing her words . " I 'd been to the corner pillar box to post a letter I 'd just been after writin ' , and as I come back up the steps out walks Miss Rilla . Good evenin ' , Mrs. O'Brien , ' she says in her pretty voice , Father is better to-night , and I 'm going to the cinema with a friend . ' Have you got your key , Miss Rilla ? ' says I. Indeed and I have , ' says she , and takes it out of her black bag and shakes it at me . " " What 's that ? " interrupted Strangely quickly . " Her bag ? You say she had a black bag ? You mean a travelling bag ? " " Lord love you , no , sir , " replied his informant . " Her handbag , it was . The big one she carried to work and all . She used to- " " Yes , " broke in Lawe impatiently , " she always carried a goodsized bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do typing at home at night " Well , now , " began Mrs. O'Brien with a surprised look , but Lawe was not listening . " I 'd know it anywhere , " he went on rapidly , " because of a  | ' scratch I made one day on the side . I wanted to get her a new one , but she would n't hear of it . " " A fair-sized black bag with a scratch on one side , " ruminated Strangely . " That 's a good thing to remember . Can either of you think of anything else that might be helpful in the search , something you may have overlooked until now  --  some distinguishing trait or mannerism ? " Mrs. O'Brien shook her head vigorously , and Lawe confirmed her denial . " There was nothing  --  unless the fact of her extraordinary beauty could mark her out . " " The world is full of beautiful girls , " said Strangely wearily . " You can think of nothing farther then , Mrs. O'Brien , nothing Miss Ravenelle did  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , her pleasant , florid face creased in a frown . " Well , now , I seem to  --  yes , sir , I do remember something now . She was after saying one more thing . Tell Father it will be all right ! ' " Both men looked up sharply . " What did she mean ? " questioned Strangely swiftly . " Had anything gone wrong ? " " No , sir , it did n't seem so . Leastwise , naught that I 'd knowledge of . And , truth to tell , the words slipped me mind till this minute past . She was always that thoughtful of poor Mr. Ravenelle , I figgered as how she only meant to say she 'd be all right and home soon . Indeed , I never give a thought more to it . I took him his tea at half after the hour and tolt him she 'd soon be back . He only smiled , and I know he thought naught of it . But , come morning , ' t was half wild he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there 's no one seen her since ! " . There was a pause , Strangely piecing together as best he could the jumble of facts he had just heard , Geoffrey Lawe wondering desperately as to his sweetheart 's fate , Mrs. O'Brien openly wiping her eyes on her apron . " Now then , " continued Strangely finally , shaking himself out  | of a heavy reverie . " Just one more thing , and we 'll be done . " He smiled pleasantly . " Had Mr. Ravenelle or his daughter any friends who came often to see them ? " The woman considered . " They was always very quiet folk , " she said at last , " though Miss Rilla was sweet enough to all me lodgers . But friends  --  no . As for the old man , his nevvy was all ever come to see him . Mr. Cumberland , that was . And I 'm thinkin ' ' t was more Miss Rilla brought him , than love for his uncle , " she ended shrewdly . Her tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his taste , nevertheless also subtly conveyed a hint of something else that Strangely was quick to seize upon . " You dislike Cumberland , Mrs. O'Brien , " he pronounced sharply . " That I do ! " replied the landlady firmly . " Though why , I do n't know . A pleasant enough spoke young man he is , but , from the first time ever I laid eyes on him a year past , I could not abide him . Him and his smooth ways ! " Strangely looked surprised . " You say you first saw him a year ago ? Then he was not living in London before that ? " " I could n't say , sir . But he never come here till one year past . " " And did he come often to see Mr. Ravenelle ? " " Every day or so , till the past fortnight . " " What type of man was he in appearance , I mean ? " probed Strangely . " I 'm thinkin ' he was the kind might well turn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what with the glib talk of him and his great black eyes . Powerful built he was , six foot if an inch , with a fine high color the which many a girl could envy , white teeth and hair as black as a Japanee . But a look I did n't like for all that . " Strangely pondered this fresh information for some minutes longer , and then brought the interview to a close by demanding whether he might , without disturbing Mr. Ravenelle , take a look at the missing girl 's bed-chamber.  | It appeared that this was easily possible , as the old man had not stirred from his own bed since the day after his daughter 's disappearance , and his sleeping room was separated from hers by a small living-room . This last loom opened , in turn , on the stair landing . Mrs. O'Brien let them in with her own key , remarking that they could inspect the place to their heart 's content , for Mr. Ravenelle was now under the influence of a sleeping-draught and would not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men entered the door of the girl 's room . Lawe half paused , feeling a reluctance to enter here in Rilla 's absence , to poke and pry among her poor possessions , and to disclose to alien eyes those simple things with which she had surrounded herself in her poverty-stricken home . Strangely entertained no such qualms . He was there to seek information which might aid in the recovery , living or dead , of the girl upon whom centered young Lawe 's devotion . There was no time for hesitancy . A minute examination must be made . I le stood slowly revolving in the center of the room , trying to picture from it the possible tastes of its owner . There was little enough to go on , and the place , to one less keen than the American , might well have offered no clue to the character of Rilla Ravenelle . The room , while fresh and clean , was patently devoid of all those frivolous little touches which usually distinguish one which is occupied by a girl still in her ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprint of her personality here , unless its very simplicity could be adjudged as such . There were no pictures on the walls , no unessential fripperies . On a small table by the window stood a sewing-box filled with mended stockings , attesting at least to an industrious nature . A small book and a neatly folded newspaper lay beside them . On the dresser were a few cheap toilet articles of the type found at Woolworth 's , and Strangely had no doubt that they were indeed purchased at Ilse ' Tottenham Court Road branch store , which was not far away . Beside these , in an inexpensive little frame , stood a kodak picture oI ( ; colTrey Lawe . Strangely noted , half pitying and half amused ,  | how the quick color rushed to his companion 's face when he , too , observed this . The American crossed in leisurely fashion to the table by the window , ran his hand idly through the pages of the book , observing as he did so that it was a French dictionary . He then glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one baggy coat pocket . A further thorough inspection evidently yielded little more of interest , but , when he had finished , Strangely strolled back to the one small window , and again looked out . It opened , as is customary in most Bloomsbury houses , upon , a back courtyard some thirty feet below  --  a narrow courtyard displaying a few islands of matted grass on its hard-packed dirt surface  --  surrounded by a high brick wall . Two sides of this wall separated other similar courtyards from that of Mrs. O'Brien . The remaining side opened upon a dingy , alley-like passage by means of a small green door , evidently the tradesman 's entrance . This door appeared to be bolted on the inside . Strangely gazed out for a moment or two in a dissatisfied manner , then turned back to his companion and Mrs. O'Brien , who had just tip-toed heavily back from the sick man 's room . She reported her lodger as being in a light , restless sleep broken by tossing and muttering . " Do you think I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes , sir , " acquiesced the woman obligingly . " He wo n't wake yet awhile . It 's something the doctor was after giving him to make him sleep . Just come this way . " The two men softly followed her through a dreary living-room in which there had been some apparent effort at beautification in the shape of two potted plants and several gay cushions . Strangely figured shrewdly that both touches bore the imprint of Mrs. O'Brien 's hand . Beyond this room was a door which opened into a second bed-chamber . Bare , clean , unadorned as a monk 's cell , it was little more than a cubicle . A bed , a chair , a washstand . And here again , as in Rilla 's bed-chamber , no ornament of any kind . A faint greenish glow shone from the night lamp be-  | side the bed where , under a heap of tumbled coverings which concealed his distorted limbs , lay a man some sixty years of age . He was tossing feverishly in a troubled slumber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was a striking one  --  heavy , hawklike features , cut , as Lawe had said , as clearly as those on a Roman coin , and topped by a leonine mass of snowwhite hair . To Strangely , the face and head were somehow hauntingly familiar . He felt that somewhere in the past he had seen them before . Yet , strive as he might , he could not remember . " Possibly it 's only that resemblance to the early Romans that makes me feel I 've seen him somewhere , " he thought to himself . But this explanation did not satisfy . Instinct told him there was something further , some incident he could not place , some door in his brain which temporarily had clamped shut upon the elusive memory he was seeking to evoke . It disconcerted him . Silently regarding the unconscious sleeper for a moment more , the three watchers stood . Then they withdrew as silently , Strangely and Lawe following their stout guide back down the illy lighted stairs to the cubby-hole on the ground floor where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much help you were getting , " said the woman apologetically when they stood ready to go . Strangely thrust his hands into the pockets of his rather shabby coat as he gazed about the bright little room . " Oh , I do n't know about that , " he replied in the cheerful Yankee drawl which fell so oddly on English ears . " All the pieces of the puzzle may be right here now , but they 're not much good until we find the key . At least we shall carry away the memory of a pleasant hour spent in your pretty room . By the way , where did you get those attractive little paintings on your wall ? " It was a simple question , idly asked with the kindly idea of pleasing the woman , but the keen-eyed Strangely did not miss her almost imperceptible start , and the slight pause before she answered glibly in her rich brogue. " indeed , sir , ' t is kind of you to praise me few poor decorations ,  | but I ca n't rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien picked up before he died . A great lover of pitchers was O'Brien . " " And I believe that 's the first lie she 's told to-night , " remarked Strangely thoughtfully , as he and Lawe strolled away . " Now I wonder why ! "  | III THE GHASTLY FIND " DO N'T know , I 'm sure , " said Lawe indifferently , and then added with impatience , " Well , did you find anything ? " " Did you ? " countered Strangely . " Of course not . It 's just because I 've been looking for three days , ever since she disappeared , and have n't found anything , that I 've come to you . Scotland Yard ca n't , or wo n't , give me any information . Ca n't , is my opinion , for MacDonald said he 'd give me a call directly any new development arose . I asked him if he minded my bringing you into the case if I could , and he said no , as long as you did n't interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any progress . Now , if you 've found nothing , it seems that we 're at a deadlock ! " Strangely smiled as he loped along , taking his thin , rangy form over the ground at a tremendous speed with no apparent effort . " Did I say I had n't found anything ? " he inquired quietly . " I just asked if you had . " " Then you have ! " cried Lawe with excitement . " I 'm not sure . I can tell you better later on . There are only two things I am reasonably satisfied about at the present moment . One  --  the young woman evidently reciprocated your affection . Two  --  she expected to return very shortly . " " What makes you think that ? " asked the younger man eagerly . " Naturally , " elucidated Strangely , " she would not give the picture of a man to whom she was totally indifferent , the place of honor  --  in fact , the only place  --  on her bureau . And naturally , again , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture with her had she contemplated a stay of some time away  | from home , especially as the picture itself was small and easy to pack away . " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Lawe gloomily , his blue eyes clouded . " She may have had one of this Cumberland that she took with her . If he 's as much of a lad as Mrs. O'Brien seems to think , he 's probably jolly fond of having his portrait made . " " Was that your reason ? " grinned Strangely amiably . " No , it was n't , " replied Lawe , a bit affronted . " That 's a snapshot . She took it herself one Sunday afternoon , with my camera . " " And by the same token , " cut in the other lazily , " I guess you must have one of her . I should have asked you at once , of course . All the best detectives do , I 've heard . That shows what a wetsmack I am . I wonder you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? " Lawe colored . " I 've heard enough of your methods , Mr. Strangely , " he replied , " to know that if you did n't ask to see Rilla 's portrait , you 'd some good reason for it . And , " he added curiously , " if you do n't mind telling , I 'd really like to know what it was . " " Such trust is touching , " drawled Strangely , rather pleased nevertheless . " Well , let 's just call it a little peculiarity of mine . As a matter of fact , I 've found out from my work that , while you can tell a whole lot from a man 's face , you can find out darned little from a woman 's  --  and that little is generally just about what she wants you to know . Women have a habit of registering whatever they want to , in a photograph , and it 's bound to have some effect upon the fellow who 's trying to figure out their character . I prefer to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities all worked out before I see them , if possible . Even then I only bother with photographs as a means of identification  --  physical landmarks , as it were , bone structure , skull formation and so on . Do you get me ? Now let 's have the photo . You 've got it with you , of course ! " Without replying , Lawe stopped under the next street-lamp , for it was by now wholly dark , drew carefully from his inner coat pocket a little leather case , and handed it open to his companion . A  | With an odd feeling of suppressed excitement , Strangely took it from him . Under a thin coating of isinglass , the American saw laughing up at him the face of the prettiest girl he had ever seen . But it was not his admiration that held him silent . Rather it was a feeling of cold disappointment . Subconsciously he had been thinking that Rilla Ravenelle 's face , when he first saw it , would perhaps ring the alarm that would waken his memory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had drawn blank . If he had seen the father , at any rate he felt sure he had never before seen the daughter . Again , he tried to picture Ravenelle 's massive , handsome features against some background that fitted . No use . Never mind , it was bound to come to him sometime . He handed back the leather case . " Well ? " questioned Lawe . " She 's very lovely , " said Strangely honestly . Lawe was satisfied . He put the case carefully away , his eyes filled with pain , and turned again to the older man as they strolled along . " What are you going to do now ? " he asked . Strangely consulted his watch . " Nearly nine o'clock , " he said , " but not too late to drop in on young Cumberland . We 're just around the corner from the address you gave me of his rooms . I 'm rather anxious to see him and learn what he has to say . You 've never met him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't seen his cousin for two weeks ? " " Oh , MacDonald looked him up at once and questioned him , of course . But we 'll go around if you like . I would n't mind seeing him myself . " In London a few city blocks often are equivalent to a whole world of difference in atmosphere . And Gower Street , though only a good stone 's throw from Acacia Villas , was nevertheless in a far better neighborhood . It was a street of one-time impressive and solid mansions , now for the most part made over into apartment and rooming-houses of the better class . No. 37 was a rather  | imposing gray stone building which occupied a corner , and , just as the two men turned into the street , a taxi-cab drew away from the front door . The maid , who had been standing on the steps to speed some parting guest , shivered in the cool wind and turned to go in . Lawe and Strangely hastened their pace , catching up with her just as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strangely greeted her briskly . " Is Mr. Cumberland here ? " The girl , a plump and comely brunette , turned and eyed him curiously . " He 's just left , " she said in a rather pleasant voice with a trace of cockney accent . " That was him in the cab . It 's too bad you missed him . " " Gone for the evening ? " put in Lawe . " Oh , no , sir , " the girl replied in surprise , " He 's gone for good . I just put his luggage in the cab for him . He did n't have any big boxes . " " Ah , yes , of course , " put in Strangely suavely , totally ignoring the look of amazement on Lawe 's face , " I thought I told you that , my boy . Cumberland was called out of town , but I had no idea he was leaving before the midnight train or I 'd have seen him off . Let 's see  --  Euston Station , I believe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maid obligingly , with a curious side-glance at Lawe . " You might catch ' im yet , sir . " And she made a move as if to close the door . But Strangely laid a large compelling hand on the knob . " As a matter of fact , " he went on smoothly , " what I actually came for was a look at Cumberland 's room , with an eye to taking it over myself . It 's not rented yet , I suppose ? " " Oh , no , sir . Not yet , sir . Mr. Cumberland decided so sudden to go . I 'll call Mrs. Lugg , sir , " and the girl ushered them into a high , gloomy hallway before she dashed up the stairs . " Mrs. Lugg , ma'am , " they could hear her shouting at the top of her voice . " Friends of Mr. Cumberland to see ' is room ! " Lawe opened his mouth to speak , but Strangely raised his  | hand in an imperative silencing gesture . From somewhere above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dora 's loud information . " Tell the gentlemen to come up , Dora . " They were met at the top of the first flight by a small , elderly woman with a gentle , worried face . " You can see the room , gentlemen , " she said in her plaintive little voice , " but it is n't rightly set in order yet , Mr. Cumberland just this minute leaving and all . " " That 's all right , Mrs. Lugg , " said Strangely , already pat with her name . " I can get an idea just the same . " She led them down another hallway , high and gloomy like the lower one , and stopped before a heavy dark door , numbered 16 . " Mind your foot , sirs , " she admonished as she opened it . " There 's two steps down . " As she spoke she struck a match , and a gas-jet by the door flared up . Lawe and Strangely , entering after her , found themselves in a lofty , narrow room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was covered with a dark , nondescript carpet , heavy dark furniture was upholstered in ancient red plush and hung with knitted tidies . The greenish wall-paper was old and faded in spots where pictures at different times had been hung and then removed . But three or four heads of Victorian maidens still simpered modestly down at the onlooker , and dozens of pieces of bric-it-brac and souvenirs crowded all the available space on the chimney-piece . The dingy , dark-brown hangings at the windows did not look overly clean , but the bed was freshly made  --  evidently Mrs. Lugg had been engaged in this task when interrupted by Dora . The wardrobe and chest of drawers still stood open , as if just recently hurriedly emptied of their contents ; a soiled and discolored towel hung over the back of a chair , and the wash-howl was stilt half full of dirty water . Strangely glanced about appraisingly , and then spoke . At his words , Lawe 's jaw dropped before he could control it . " I 'll take the room , Mrs. Lugg . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll pay you for a day in advance , and send for  | my belongings to-morrow . I 'd like to take possession at once , if I may . " His hand went to his pocket . " Very good , sir , " said the little woman hesitatingly . " It 's a bit irregular , sir , but I can see you 're honest  --  and being a friend of Mr. Cumberland  --  six and six it is , with bath and breakfast . Lunch and dinner extra , if you 're eating in . Was you hungry now , sir ? Supper is done , but Dora can bring you some tea and cold joint , if you wish . " " No , thank you , " replied Strangely amiably , as he counted out the required coins and then walked toward the table . " However , I 'll just write a letter that I must post immediately , and I 'm afraid I 'll have to trouble you for writing materials . The maid can clean the room up after I 've gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora , Dor  --  ah ! " fluttered Mrs. Lugg , disappearing through the doorway . " Writing paper for Mr. Sixteen . " Dora appeared at once with the required materials , awkwardly bowing herself out after she had handed them to Strangely . The two men were left alone . " Well , " exploded Lawe , at last giving way to his surprise and curiosity , " What under the name of But " Mr. Sixteen " quickly placed one finger on his lips in a silencing gesture , crossed hastily to the door , turned the key in the lock , deftly flung his broad-brimmed felt hat over the knob , and recrossed the room to his companion 's side . Then , quietly and swiftly , he looked at the unemptied washbowl , examined the soiled towel , and jammed it into his pocket , hurriedly bending , as he did so , over the open bureau drawers . " Luck , absolutely , " he breathed softly , " our coming just at that moment . Otherwise , they might have had time to clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would have kept right on if I had n't pulled that bull about wanting to write a letter , in order to get rid of them . Now what do you suppose took Cumberland away in such an infernal hurry to-night ? " " Fright , perhaps , " suggested Lawe . " Yes , but  --  well , never mind now . We ca n't spend too much  | time here . There is too much to be done . Get busy and see if you can find anything of interest  --  and look your darndest . " Lawe obediently joined in the search , and , for the next fifteen minutes , they diligently investigated every nook and cranny in the room  --  the wardrobe , the washstand , the window sills and ledges , the seats and backs of the chairs , every square inch of the shabby carpet . They even tore apart the bed , and made it carefully up again . " What the deuce are we looking for ? " panted Lawe at last , as , flushed and warm , he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " grinned Strangely , " although the search was not as aimless as it might appear . I got his thumb-prints beautifully on this old razor blade . " He wrapped the small piece of steel tenderly in his handkerchief as he spoke . " I see the wastebasket 's been emptied . Perhaps Mrs. Lugg did it , or perhaps Cumberland . Lawe , if you were going to empty a waste-basket , and did n't want anyone to find the contents , and were in a hurry ? a damnable hurry  --  what would you do ? " " How do you know he wanted to hide the contents ? " , Lawe borrowed a Yankee trick from his companion and asked a question in reply . " I do n't know it , " replied Strangely impatiently . " I 'm supposing it . What would you do ? " " We-ell , " Lawe hesitated . " I think I 'd stuff the things in my pockets and get rid of them later . " " Would you , by heck ? " said Strangely , struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket , after all , " added Lawe . " Bound to be , " answered Strangely . " There 's always something in a waste-basket  --  especially if you 're clearing out and going some place else  --  always a bunch of junk to throw away . Yet here we have a singularly empty basket . And I had some reason to believe we might find something we wanted in it . He 's cleaned it out , you can bet ! " " There does n't seem to be anything further here , " he added ,  | taking his hat off the door-knob , and preparing to leave the room . " I think we might as well go . " " Are you taking poor Mrs. Lugg 's dirty towel with you ? " inquired Lawe in some surprise as he noted the fringe hanging out of the other man 's coat pocket . " I am , indeed , " replied Strangely , poking it down out of sight . " That towel just naturally bothered me . I had to get it , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that step ! " as Lawe made a backward move toward the door . But he had spoken too late . Lawe stumbled over the lower step , and only saved himself from an unpleasant fall by clutching at the top one . " Pick yourself up , man , and come on , " began Strangely impatiently , but paused at Lawe 's look of amazement . " Look , look ! " he was whispering excitedly . " Come here ? quick ! This upper step gives a bit when you grasp it , and I 'll swear it looks to me as if the nails had been taken out recently ? see , when you look closely , this way  --  and then put back again ! " Strangely bent quickly down . " By Jing , you 're right , " he said . " Only you 're wrong about them being nails . They 're screws . See ? And they have been out very recently . Someone , Cumberland probably , must have done the job in a hurry and did n't screw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why the step moved slightly when you clutched the top . We 'd never have noticed it otherwise , I suppose . Here , wait a minute ! " With a hand that was skilled and deft in all its movements in spite of its large-boned , ungainly appearance , he extracted a minute combination screwdriver and corkscrew from an inner pocket . " Never travel without it , " explained the typical American , busily engagirg himself in drawing out the screws . " One  --  two , " he counted as he worked . " Give a guess , now . Do we , or do n't we find anything here ? Did he keep something here and take it away with him ? Or did he hide something here just before he left ? Three  --  is there , or is n't there  --  four ? "  | " There is ! " breathed Lawe . " I 'm sure of it ! " " So am I , " agreed Strangely . " I 've a hunch . Well , here goes . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted the heavy piece of wood that formed the top of the step , and the two men peered down into the hollow thus disclosed . Although a rather disagreeable odor wafted upward with the release of the step , it seemed for a moment as if nothing were there after all . And then Lawe , with a quick exdamation , pounced upon a small darkish object lying well back in one corner . Instantly , with an oath , he recoiled and dropped it again . " Here , what is it ? " jerked Strangely , putting down the board he was still holding , alarmed by the other man 's action . Rather gingerly he , too , picked up the little object , and , as he did so , expelled a sharp breath of astonished horror . It was a blood-stained human finger !  | IV THE MYSTERIOUS MR . SMITH SMALL , slender , shapely , indubitably that of a woman , it lay in a hand that Strangely himself had some ado to keep from shaking . Geoffrey Lawe was leaning back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nausea . The cold perspiration stood out on his forehead . " God ? " he muttered , " this is awful ? " " Brace up , " admonished Strangely , almost as shaken as the younger man by their ghastly discovery . " Nothing can be accomplished by going to pieces . Let 's take stock of the thing as calmly as we can . To my mind , what we have found is undoubtedly the middle finger of a woman 's hand . Whether left or right I ca n't tell just yet , but I imagine the right , as it seems to be slightly calloused on the under side and there are indications of an ink stain at the tip . As I say , it is a woman 's finger , but there is no proof that it is Miss Ravenelle 's , or that she has been ? done away with . The blood is completely dried and caked , and , from the condition of the finger itself , I should say that it is several days old . But as to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look here , Lawe . I hate to ask you , but  --  is there anything familiar about this ? Does it seem  --  would you recognize it  --  if it were hers ? " For a moment a shudder was Lawe 's only reply . His eyes had grown bright and feverish , and deep lines seemed suddenly to have been gashed in his white face . With the utmost force of will-power , he brought his gaze again to bear upon the hideous object . " Her  --  her hands were not like that , " he said hoarsely at last ,  | clasping his head with both hands as if to help himself concentrate . " Her nails were  --  dainty  --  shining . This finger-nail is thick , broken Then suddenly , trembling , he rose to his feet . " By Heaven , " he gasped , " Cumberland is behind this . The finger may not belong to Rilla  --  I ' 11 swear it does n't  --  but it means that Cumberland is behind a filthy business of some kind . And we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following him  --  making his life a hell " Hush , man , for the Lord 's sake ! " pleaded Strangely . " Do you want to rouse the house and have every Tom , Dick and Harry rushing in here to see what 's the matter ? It 's horrible , all right , but try to keep cool . I see what you mean about Cumberland . He must be mixed up in some rotten deal , of course . And even though this may not be proof that Miss Ravenelle is dead  --  yet some other poor creature may be . And if he would commit one crime , he would commit another " Strangely 's voice trailed into silence , and he thought quickly . " We have n't really lost him , you know , " he continued . " He headed for Victoria Station , and that probably means the coast . It should be easy to pick up his trail . But I 'll be willing to wager everything I own against a plugged nickel that Scotland Yard is on his heels this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your head . Rage does no good . " The dazed look cleared from Lawe 's blue eyes , and he passed a hand weakly across his forehead . " You 're right , " he said thickly . " Rage does no good . I must keep my head . Now then  --  now then . Let 's get things straight . Rilla disappears three days ago . Cumberland makes no attempt at flight . Now , suddenly , he leaves . Then we find this  --  thinghere . If Rilla is not the victim , someone else is , at any rate . He must have had the body concealed somewhere in this room , but , realizing the impossibility of longer concealment , he has somehow managed to take it away with him . He intends to dispose of it later , of course . When he can do so without suspicion falling on him . Did n't that maid say something about luggage in his  | cab ? But , somehow , in his haste , he has forgotten to take  --  this ! God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brusquely . " Ca n't you see how impossible such a theory is ? It would have been impossible for him to keep a body here for one minute . There 's absolutely no place where he could have hidden it . The screws on this other step have not even been disturbed , and we 've gone over the rest of the room with a fine-tooth comb . Even if the body had been in one of his large suit-cases ( which is absurd ) he would have been unable to keep it here for three days without detection . Besides , there would have been some little sign of it , some trifling spot or stain that escaped Cumberland 's notice . No , you can make up your mind that there has been no body here . Consequently , the finger was brought to this room from somewhere outside . " He was talking hurriedly on , giving Lawe a chance to regain his self-control . " Therefore , the first question is  --  Who. brought it ? Although we can not be sure , the logical answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did he bring it ? That I ca n't say as yet , any more than I can say whose it is , or where he got it . Furthermore , we have no real proof that he is a murderer , at all . We suspect him , yes , but suspicions alone never convicted anybody . One thing , however , is certain . This circumstance , taken in connection with his cousin 's disappearance , is enough to put him in a most unpleasant position , if he is really innocent of any crime ! " The discovery is undoubtedly an important one , but I am going to ask you not to tell MacDonald about it until to-morrow morning . There are some other things to be done , and then I think it is safe to promise that I can tell him much more . I 'll keep the thing for to-night . And you must put it out of your thoughts as much as possible . Now help me screw this step down again . " So , for what was probably the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two men had finished their task ,  | Lawe faced the older man with a shade more color in his face , but with eyes that still were dilated and unnatural-looking . He spoke huskily . " You said a short time ago , that you had good reason to think he had thrown something in the scrap-basket . Did you think it was something like this ? " " My Lord , no ! " denied Strangely vigorously . " The affair is assuming far more serious proportions than I had anticipated . I had been presupposing a simple disappearance . Now , there seems to be no doubt that someone is dead  --  whether from natural or unnatural causes  --  and that , for some unfathomable reason , a human ghoul has placed this mutilated finger under the step in Cumberland 's room . No . What I was hoping to find in the basket had nothing to do with such a ghastly thing . Look ? " He pulled the soiled towel out of his pocket , and , as it fell open , Lawe gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Strangely , " not blood . Although it has somewhat the same appearance . No , it is something else . And the thing I was looking for , in the waste-basket , might have told me something I wanted to know about it . I shall take the towel home and examine it in my little laboratory  --  did you know I have a small but rather perfectly equipped laboratory of my own ? And now , come on . It 's time we were making our next move . " Together , they descended the stairs , encountering the maid Dora in the lower hall . " Here 's your door-key , sir , " she said . " Our gentlemen all has their own keys and comes and goes as they pleases . Mrs. Lugg asked would I please give it to you . And wot 's the name , please , sir ? " Strangely gave the required information , bid the girl a kindly good night , and then walked with his companion down the flight of stone steps that led to Gower Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance into Mrs. Lugg 's lodging house , but the cold , damp air felt rather  | pleasant than otherwise on their hot faces , after the shock and excitement of the last half-hour . " Where to , now ? " asked Lawe at last , after they had walked briskly along for a few minutes in silence . " I 'm going to get a bite to eat and a good strong cup of coffee , " said Strangely firmly , " and I advise you to do the same . " " Eat ! " exclaimed Lawe in horror . " I feel as though I never could eat again ! " " Pure hysteria , " was the curt reply . " Now take a tip from me , young man . This may prove to be a bad affair . I need every bit of help you can give me , and so  --  if she is living  --  does Rilla Ravenelle . To that end , you must put aside personal feeling as much as possible , and muster all the strength you have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't do it entirely alone . " There was a second 's silence . Then : " Righto , " said Lawe steadily . " Attaboy ! " commended Strangely with an encouraging pressure of his big , bony fingers on the other 's slim shoulder . He steered his companion into an all-night coffee stall labelled in rather straggling letters A FINE PULL-UP FOR CAR MEN . " A fine pull-up for us , too , " he commented as he gave the order . " We need one . " After Lawe resolutely had swallowed part of a sandwich and a cup of steaming black coffee , he felt somewhat better . In spite of himself , he became more cheerful . He turned to Strangely , who already was puffing on his dilapidated old corncob . " Look here , " he said , " there 's some of this , in fact most of it , that I do n't understand . You seem to feel that you have got somewhere , but I 'm still totally in the dark . Why , for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ? " Strangely put his hand in a capacious pocket and pulled out the paper . " Because I saw something I wanted to read at my leisure , " he replied , handing it to Lawe . " Do you notice anything interesting on the front page ? " Lawe looked it over carefully .  | " Nothing that seems of interest to us . " " Well , perhaps it 's nothing  --  perhaps it 's a lot , " said Strangely . " Personally , I think it 's a lot . But that 's pure guess-work . A hunch , as we say at home . Does this word make you think of anything you have heard to-night ? " He pointed to the word Folkestone at the top of a column . Lawe hesitated . " No  --  yes  --  just a minute , " he answered slowly , as if feeling for his words . " By Jove , I believe I know what you must mean . Cumberland , eh ? Dora said he had gone to Victoria Station . And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long chance . He might have gone a number of other places from there . What makes you pick on Folkestone ? " " Read on ! " commanded Strangely . " Read what this item says . " His finger followed the printed matter down the page : YACHT HERMIT GENEROSITY OF WEALTHY AMERICAN Mr. Henry Smith , the wealthy American whose beautiful yacht Wall-Flower is anchored at Folkestone , is a welcome visitor at this coast town . Mr. Smith has just made a contribution to the local unemployed fund , and , upon a former visit a little over a year ago , gave another evidence of his generosity by feting the children of the local orphan asylum , on board his vessel . Since then Mr. Smith , an enthusiastic amateur yachtsman , has been around the world . Although the owner of the Wall-Flower is an old friend , the yacht itself is a new visitor in our harbor , Mr. Smith 's former pleasure-boat having sunk recently in a bad storm off the coast of Africa . " Well ? " queried Lawe when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My dear Lawe , " replied Strangely patiently , " what about the sea-faring man who took Rilla Ravenelle and her father to Mrs. O'Brien 's eight years ago ? "  | " By Jove  --  yes , of course . But he was foreign-looking , she said . And this man is an American  --  a wealthy one , too . " " All that glitters is not gold . Or it seems to me I 've heard something to that effect . And every bird who calls himself an American does n't happen to be one . Certain people never are hard up for any sort of passport . Nothing is easier than to palm yourself off as a wealthy American , just by taking a name like Hank Billings or Henry Smith or Ezra Brown , and throwing around a little surplus coin with a free hand . You 'll probably find that this Smith has been a more or less frequent visitor to Folkestone during a number of years , without having any special attention paid to him . The time he really wants some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets in the papers . As far as the sailor is concerned  --  the one who brought the Ravenelles to London  --  he might have been just one of the crew . " " You think , then , that the Ravenelles knew this sailor ? That he did n't just happen to be passing along the street , as he said ? " Strangely shrugged . " That part of the story sounded rather fishy to me , though I imagine Mrs. O'Brien believed it . But now , let 's suppose that the sailor did bring them from some particular yacht which had put in at Folkestone for that very purpose , Folkestone or some other coast town near to London . Just look how things hinge up ! " Strangely began to check the items off on his fingers . " This fellow , whoever he is , brings Ravenelle and the child to an obscure lodging-house in Bloomsbury , a place where he will be apt to encounter few people of his own class . From this we can judge that Ravenelle , while not perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less inconspicuous . Evidently  --  if this hypothesis is right  --  he and the sailor have cooked it up between them to appear as strangers . Fewer explanations . The sailor then leaves . His boat , or his master 's boat , touches frequently at Folkestone , until a little over a year ago , perhaps a year and a half . Please note this particularly , for up till that time the Ravenelles ( or so Mrs. O'Brien believed ) received money from some place  --  Folkestone , she thought the post-mark of the letters  | was  --  enough money evidently to exist on . But coincident with the yacht 's last stop at Folkestone  --  that is to say , some time over a year ago  --  Rilla Ravenelle tells Mrs. O'Brien that they have no more money , and that she , Rilla , must go to work . A few days ago , however , they see by the paper that the Wall-Flower is anchored at Folkestone . They send word to Smith ( of course , it 's more than likely that they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they make an appointment with him somewhere , probably to ask about money . Since Ravenelle himself is unable to keep the appointment , Rilla goes . The fact that he let her go shows that he evidently feared nothing from the man Smith . So the fact of the girl 's disappearance must have come as a frightful shock . I imagine he felt himself to be responsible , and that accounts for his present state of mind . Well , what do you think of my theory ? " " I 'm afraid it seems a bit far-fetched to me , " objected Lawe , his eyes tired and strained again . " I would say that your imagination is carrying you away . " " Oh , you would ! " replied Strangely crisply . " Well , what about this  --  the girl 's last words to Mrs. O'Brien , Tell Father it will be all right . ' What would be all right ? Plainly something had been worrying them , and she was going to see if she could set it right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it concerned the Wall-Flower . I 'm sure of it . Look at the date on the newspaper , for one thing . July 16th , the day before Rilla 's disappearance . " Lawe frowned slightly . " She said she was going to the cinema with a friend . " " ' Mr. Smith ' may have been the friend . Though , as I say , I have no doubt the Ravenelles knew him under a different name Lawe shook his head stubbornly . " There 's your big obstacle , " he said . " You say the Ravenelles would read in the paper that Henry Smith , owner of the WallFlower , had put in at Folkestone . Yet you also say that they probably knew this man under another name . We also know that the Wall-Flower is , new yacht , for that notice says his old one  | sank some time ago . Now , if Smith has a different name , and the yacht is a different yacht , how in the name of peace would the Ravenelles figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the only private yacht that anchored more than once in Folkestone harbor . As a matter of fact , there 's not a bit of reason , as far as I can see , to link the Ravenelles with that notice in the paper . Rilla may not even have seen it . " " It 's immaterial to me whether she saw it or not , " retorted Strangely hotly , " though I 'm sure she did . As for reasons , well , you may be sure I have my reasons for thinking she knew all about the boat , or I would n't say so . And , moreover , I not only think , but I damn well know , that there was some connection between the two ! Tell me , Mr. Lawe , how do you say the word Wall-Flower in French ? " Lawe stared at him blankly , taken aback by the sudden question . " I  --  why , how should I know ? " he replied sharply . " Why do you ask ? " Like a flash Strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion  --  the small French dictionary he had taken from the table in Rilla Ravenelle 's room . Hastily , he whipped through the pages until he had found what he sought , a page with a lightly under-scored word , near the middle of the book . " There ! " he said , a note of triumph sounding through his voice . " Take a look-see , Lawe . The French word for wall-flower , or rather the French word for a certain species of wall-flower , is ? Ravenelle ! "  | V THE EIGHT O'CLOCK POST THERE was a brief silence while the eyes of the two men caught and held . For both of them the situation was fraught with meaning . " It 's amazing guess-work , " said Lawe finally . " Amazing . You think , then , that Rilla is on this yacht ? " " That 's something else again . What I think is one thing . Positive evidence is another . But  --  well  --  as things stand now , would it be too much to assume that Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall-Flower ( or to meet someone from the Wall-Flower ) on the evening of July 17th ? And that she did not reach the yacht at all , or else came to grief upon it ? At least it 's a working basis . On the other hand , however , while we have possible evidence that Rilla Ravenelle started to keep an appointment , and possible evidence that Ralph Cumberland was party to some crime , we have positively no evidence that Miss Ravenelle was actually the victim , and positively no evidence that Cumberland was connected in any way with Smith ' of the Wall-Flower . But , personally , I think he was ! " " You say you think that Rilla with Cumberland 's connivance ' may have gone to keep some appointment , " interrupted Lawe , struggling to keep pace with Strangely 's mental leaps . " What makes you think that ? " " Did you notice anything at all odd when you looked out Rilla Ravenelle 's window to-night  --  the window at the back of her bedroom ? " inquired Strangely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brick wall , and two other courtyards on either side of Mrs. O'Brien 's . That 's all . "  | " That 's all I saw at first , " said Strangely meditatively , " but I was n't satisfied . I felt that somehow the window had something to do with the problem  --  another hunch maybe . Then I noticed that beyond the brick wall , and beyond the alley-way behind the wall , directly in line with the girl 's window , was a large vacant lot where some building had been torn down . That vacant lot extended clear through to the next street . Still , I could make nothing of it , though I still had my hunch . And when I get a hunch , I generally follow it up . When we left Mrs. O'Brien 's house , we walked one block north , one block east , and another block south . That brought us to 37 Gower Street , Cumberland 's lodging house . And what was the first thing that struck me in the eye when we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same vacant lot ! After that , it did n't surprise me to find that Cumberland 's room was on the front of the house  --  a clean sweep between his window and Rilla 's . He must have taken that particular room with the idea of signalling , or communicating in some way , with his cousin ! " " You think so ? " queried Lawe excitedly . " You believe that he conveyed some message to her on the night of her disappearance ? " " I certainly do , " said Strangely promptly . " I ca n't think anything else . It was a perfect situation for anything of that kind . Too perfect , in fact , to have happened just through mere coincidence  --  an unobstructed view from one window to the other . In addition , when I first entered Miss Ravenelle 's room , I observed ( as you probably did , also ) that a table with a basket of mended stockings was standing by the window . But what you probably did not notice was that , on the window-sill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threaded needle stuck in it . That means just one thing to me . The girl must have been standing at the window , utilizing the last few moments of daylight to mend a stocking while she waited for some expected signal from Cumberland 's room . Presumably , a few minutes before eight o'clock , she saw what she had been waiting for , hastily stuck the needle in the stocking , and laid it down , put on her hat and coat , and left the house . Reasonable so far ? "  | " It sounds so , " agreed Lawe , whose head was whirling . When had Strangely noticed all these things ? When had he pieced them together thus , bit by bit ? His attitude had been so neg-ligent ! " Well , then , " proceeded Strangely , " the presumed signal coming on the evening of her disappearance , coupled with the fact that I suspect she went to meet Smith or someone from the yacht , leads me to believe that Cumberland was the go-between for this meeting . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by means of signals , that it was time for her to start ! " " Why would n't he simply come and tell her that ? " inquired Lawe . " If , as you seem to think , her father knew all about it , what difference would it make ? Why should Cumberland go to all the elaborate business of signalling ? " " There are various reasons . If , as might have been the case , he intended to do away with the girl , naturally he would not care to be seen in her company on the evening of her disappearance . On the other hand , he may merely have suspected foul play , but wished to keep his own hands clean and to avoid suspicion . Perhaps he could not afford to be involved in any investigation which would bring his own affairs to light . In fact , I am almost sure such was the case . At any rate , I believe he certainly saw Rilla Ravenelle after she left Mrs. O'Brien 's on the night of July 17th ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaned Geoffrey , clenching his hands . " Oh , no , we did n't , " replied Strangely lightly . " We had nothing to do with it . And , as I said before , I think you will find that Inspector MacDonald is thorough , as well as slow . Cumberland has doubtless been shadowed ever since the case was given into the hands of Scotland Yard . " " I wish I felt as sure of it , " muttered Lawe . " God ! What a fool I 've been . I should have known from the beginning that that chap had a part in her disappearance . I should have known ! " " There 's no need to reproach yourself , " said Strangely . " You 've certainly left no stone unturned to find the girl . " But Lawe only eyed him bitterly .  | " What is the next step ? " he asked . " First , I 'm going back to my laboratory . I can cztch a bus from Shaftesbury Avenue in about five minutes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I paid for a room , so I might as well sleep in it . Besides , if Cumberland merely forgot that little token instead of leaving it there purposely , he 's apt to return for it later on . And it would be just too bad if no one were there to receive him . " Lawe 's face whitened . " I am the one to receive him , " he said . " I shall come , too . " " You 'll do nothing of the sort . You 're too excitable , " replied the American promptly . " If the fellow did happen to return , you 'd probably do some precipitate thing and upset the whole apple-cart . Remember , we really have nothing on him yet . I must do this thing in my own way , Lawe , or not at all . Cumberland may not come back . He may have left the finger on purpose . Or he may not even know it 's there ! Strange things happen in these cases . The criminal mind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're to go home and sleep . " " I ca n't sleep unless I tire myself out first . My mind is turning like a mill-wheel . I 'll walk home  --  it 's a goodish way . That may turn the trick . " " Whatever you think best . But you must get sufficient rest , for to-morrow there are two things I want you to do for me . And then , too  --  well , I think I should warn you . Since we have discovered that severed finger , it is only too possible that the rest of the victim 's body will come to light somewhere soon . You must be prepared for that  --  and for the fact that it may be Miss Ravenelle 's body ! " Lawe shuddered . " What are the two things you want me to do ? " he asked drearily . " I want you to find out if any person except Miss Ravenelle does typing at home , at Acacia Villas . And I want you to find out to whom Mrs. O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight p. m. on the evening of July 17th . Do n't ask her about it . Look up the postman . " " You do n't think Mrs. O'Brien had anything to do with Rilla 's disappearance ! " cried Lawe in horror . " Why , she worshipped the girl ! " " I do n't think anything . I merely want to know the address on the letter she mailed in the eight o'clock post . " " But how ? " queried Geoffrey blankly . " You say go to the postman . ' No postman is going to remember what letters he took at one particular pillar box , on one particular round three days ago . That 's fantastic . " " Heavens , man , " said Strangely , running his long fingers impatiently through his hair . " Did n't you ever hear of taking a chance ? It 's rather a long one , I grant you , but it seems quite reasonable to me . Figure it out for yourself . Mrs. O'Brien is not the letter-writing type . I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she does , it is more or less of an event . Accordingly , what does she do in such a case ? I 'll bet dollars to doughnuts that , nine times out of ten , she does n't feel as safe putting it in the post box as if she handed it to the postman himself ! I have n't a doubt but what she did exactly that ! In fact , everything goes to show that she did . She knew the exact time , so evidently she had been watching the clock . If you inquire at the Central Post , you 'll probably find that there is an eight p. m. mail collection at the post box  --  or pillar box as you call it  --  nearest to Acacia Villas . Also , a postman might involuntarily glance at the address on a letter that someone places *his hand . It 's quite likely that he would , and at eight p. m. out of doors these days , it 's still light . Naturally , it 's a long chance , but perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man on that route and question him diplomatically . It may be totally unimportant , but  --  well , it 's another hunch ! " And Strangely smiled grimly . " Right , " said Lawe . " And why do you want to know about the typing ? " " Think back . What did you yourself tell me about Miss  | Ravenelle ? That she carried a large bag , rather more like a brief case , because she took home typing to do at night ! Now , it has always been my experience that in order to type , one needs a typing machine . There was no sign of one in the Ravenelle apartment . And Mrs. O'Brien , you may remember , said there had never been another one in the house since the lady typewriter ' left  --  the one who taught Rilla the work . You 'd better check up on that statement , for , if it 's true , then the girl was deceiving you for some reason , and her handbag was used to carry home something else ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stool by the counter of the coffee stall , as if propelled by some electrical force . A dark , angry flush enveloped his cheeks and brow . " Do n't insinuate anything about her , Strangely , " he said in low , tense tones . " For I refuse to listen . I do not believe for one moment that she deceived me . But , if it so happens that she did , then she had some good reason for it ! " " I have n't a doubt of that . " " And besides , what difference does it make what she took home ? " went on Lawe fiercely . " I 'm sure that 's just what I want to know , " said Strangely mildly , remembering suddenly that Lawe was only twenty-three years old , after all . " Now calm down , please . There 's probably some very simple explanation . On the other hand , however , she may have taken away papers of value to your firm . No , no ! " raising his hand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . It 's too exhausting . And , really , you must face facts . The girl evidently did deceive you about the contents of her bag . And she has certainly disappeared under very peculiar circumstances . But I assure you , that if Miss Ravenelle was engaged in any enterprise a bit  --  er  --  shady , she probably was not doing so willingly , or as a free agent . Does that satisfy you ? " " No , " replied Lawe furiously , though he was careful not to raise his voice sufficiently to be overheard by the proprietor of the coffee stand , who , despairing of other customers , had stepped outside , to lean against the doorway and peer vacuously into the fog . " No ,  | it does n't ! You 've not only implied that Rilla was dishonest , but you have implied by your words that someone else in our offices was engaged in some sort of rotten game . What you have in mind , I do n't know ! But I do know that my father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we do ourselves . ! , awe &; Son is an old and honorable firm " My heavens , " replied Strangely , more than a bit surprised at this outburst . " I 'll take it back . I 'll take anything back . Only cool down . I was only trying to safeguard your own interests . " Lawe sank back shamefacedly . " Of course , " he murmured . " I understand . But it came so suddenly  --  your accusation of Rilla . And it is n't possible for me to doubt her . But go on , if you like . You do n't really think anything wrong is going on in our offices ? " His voice sounded incredulous . " I 'm afraid I do , " said Strangely gravely . " It is more than likely . For , as I see it , this affair goes much deeper than a simple disappearance , or even a murder . Each step I take seems to open up new vistas . See how far we have progressed in only two hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite fathomed yet . But I shall . Just give me time ! " His jaw clenched firmly . A moment later he knocked out the ashes from his corncob pipe , against the edge of the counter , and sprang to his feet . " Well , " he said briskly as they left the coffee-room . " I 'll have to hustle for a bus . You 're walking , you say ? I guess that 's the most sensible thing you could do . As for me , " whimsically , " I 'm off for a night of chemical debauch and of guilty dalliance in 4i Mrs. Lugg 's red-plush second-floor-front ! Drop in on me , at my own rooms , at two p. m. to-morrow . " Lawe was regarding him moodily . " Yes , " he said slowly , " you 've come a long way to-night in only two hours . You 've certainly found out a lot , one way and another . But you 're no nearer to finding Rilla Ravenelle than before . " " Now do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't forget our discovery in Cumberland 's room ; our discovery of the connection between the Ravenelles and the Wall-Flower ; and , last of all , the discovery of some possible trickery in your own firm . You may not be able to see it now , but it all brings us closer to Rilla Ravenelle . I can assure you of that . I believe her disappearance to be merely one incident in a far greater game . Rilla was a pawn . I think Cumberland is a pawn . Old Ravenelle may be a pawn , and Smith of the Wall-Flower . Behind them all is someone else . Before we find Rilla , we must find that someone else . And to find him , I think we must go to  --  well , I 'll tell you to-morrow . But I swear to you , Lawe , that I shall bring you the answer to this riddle within another forty-eight hours ! " " You really think that ? " asked Lawe slowly . " You are very sure of yourself . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , what do you say ? " " I say , " said Lawe with a sudden smile and a lightening of the cloud on his young face , " I say that I would n't give tuppence ha'penny for the someone else ' that you 're tracking down . Unless  --  unless  --  well , I 'll tell you to-morrow ! " A moment later the young man stood alone , watching the tall form of the American disappearing through the writhing mists .  | VI THE CLUTCHING DEATH STRANGELY had told him to sleep , but , when finally he sought his bed , Geoffrey Lawe 's mind was in no condition for slumber . His fevered thoughts raced from one event to another of the past few ( lays . The search in Cumberland 's room repeated itself again and again , the ghastly severed finger danced before him in the ( lark , and his imagination pictured the finding of the rest of the victim 's body sometime in the near future . He shuddered again , as his mind raced on . What had Strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant by his implication that something was wrong in the old and honorable firm of Lawe &; Son ? Surely , he could have had nothing definite to go upon . No , it had been just a guess  --  and , at any rate , MacDonald would put no stock in a tale of that kind . Absurd . Even a hint of scandal in connection with the firm would kill his father . Lawe knew that . A few years ago , when things had been going rather badly with the business , the old man had scarcely slept or eaten for months . Had cut down stringently on personal expenses in order to help things out . Everything had been going all right for some time now , but another blow of any kind would kill him . His whole life was bound up in his business . And the yacht  --  the Wall-Flower  --  with its eccentric owner . Was Cumberland on that yacht now ? Where was Rilla Ravendie ? Was she dead  --  murdered ? Finally , in desperation , Lawe rose , lighted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large dose of the  | bromide which stood there in the medicine chest . Gradually , as he lay down again , his mind became calmer . But , just as he was finally slipping into sleep , another thought brought him bolt upright . Why had Strangely been so insistent about the letter that Mrs. O'Brien had mailed on the evening of July 17th ? What did he think it contained ? And whom did he suspect to be the recipient ? Of a sudden , the letter assumed gigantic proportions in Lawe 's mind . He must look into the matter the first thing in the morning . The  --  first  --  thing  --  in  --  the  --  morning At last he slept , but not for long . He awoke long before the faint gray of morning glimmered through the fog . Though not a soul was yet astir in the house , he felt that he must get out . No four walls could hold him longer in his present state of mind . His eyes were heavy and swollen , his head dull from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp air of the foggy dawn , but , nevertheless , the throbbing in his temples lessened somewhat as soon as he had left the house . The street lights still were lighted , for the gray shroud that covered the city made it more like dusk than dawn . A little before seven he turned his steps again towards home , where , mindful of the need to conserve his strength , he sat down to his usual breakfast of bacon and eggs . Lawe , senior , a corpulent and not unhandsome old man typical of England 's prosperous upper middle class , was already seated at the table . He looked up sharply as his son slid into the place opposite , and eyed him rather unpleasantly through gold-rimmed spectacles . " You were out very late last night , " he said . " Prosperity ca n't afford to burn the candle at both ends . " Geoffrey murmured an unintelligible reply as he poked aimlessly at his plate of bacon . " Eh ? " queried the old man irascibly . " What d' you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " A fine night for a walk , no doubt . Fog so thick you could cut it with a knife . Look here , my son ! " " Yes , Father . " " You 're not worrying about that girl , are you ? Worthless baggage  --  out for all she could get ! " Young Lawe rose to his feet , trembling . " Take that back , Father . Rilla Ravenelle is as sweet and pure a girl as my own Mother was ! " " Bosh ! " snorted the old man , knitting his bushy white brows . " Do n't come that with me . If you must run with a lass of that type , run with her  --  but do n't try to whitewash her , let alone mention her in the same breath with your mother . Her getting out was the best thing that could have happened to you , you young fool . You 'll find she 's gone of her own free will  --  and with another man , no doubt ! " He sneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paled with rage . " What do you mean ? " he asked . " What reason have you to make such a statement ? " " My knowledge of human nature , that 's what . I have n't got where I am without knowing something about it . I could have got rid of her any time the last three months if I 'd made it worth her while ! " " I do n't believe it ! " " And how do you know , " continued his father with a meaning glance , " that I did n't finally make it worth her while to clear out  --  when I saw what a silly fool you were making of yourself ! " Geoffrey grasped the back of his chair . The knuckles of his clenched hand showed white . " Because I know her , " he answered thickly . " Because I love her , and she  --  loves me . " " Love  --  bah , " said his father bitterly . " You 'll find out how much she loves you when " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . And take my word for it , my lad , you 'll feel very clever when all these fancy detectives that you 're  | hiring  --  with my money  --  find her happily married to another man . Bah ! " Unable to finish his breakfast , and fearful of another scene if he remained , Geoffrey Lawe once more left the house . It was eight o'clock when he flung down the steps on his way to perform Strangely 's commissions . Allowing forty minutes for crossing the city , he figured that it would be nearing nine when he reached the Central Post . As he hurried toward the nearest bus stop , the newsboys were crying the morning editions . He could hear their raucous , unemotional voices in the distance , but , even before he could distinguish the words , he braced himself instinctively for that which he felt he might hear . The nearest boy was within hailing distance now . " Murder ! Murder ! " he was shouting hoarsely . " Orl abaht the murder on the h'embankment ! Findink h'of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's filthy , outstretched hand , Lawe snatched a paper , and held it with shaking hands while his eyes travelled hastily down the page . MUTILATED BODY MYSTERY FOG SCREENS MURDERER A gruesome murder , surpassing in horror anything of recent date , was discovered on the Thames embankment at an early hour this morning . Wrapped loosely in an old piece of tarpaulin , and thrown down upon the embankment at a point not far from St. James 's Park , was found the mutilated trunk of a young girl eighteen or twenty years of age . The head and hands are missing . The victim apparently had met her fate , at the hands of a brutal assassin , some days before , and , during the dense fog of last night , the murderer or murderers found an opportunity to dispose of the body undetected . According to the statement of medical examiners , the  | girl had been dead at least three days , very possibly longer , and the direct cause of her death was strangulation . The victim is slight , daintily made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Lawe crumpled the paper spasmodically into his pocket , and walked blindly on . At the first public telephone booth he passed , he stepped inside , and called Inspector MacDonald 's home . " Are you there , Mr. MacDonald ? " he inquired , as a heavy , rumbling voice spoke at the other end of the line . " Inspector MacDonald speaking . Is that Mr. Lawe ? I thought you 'd be calling directly you saw the morning papers . Bad news for you , I 'm afraid . It seems as if the body must be that of the young lady , though positive identification is impossible at present . We 've examined the body at headquarters , and an autopsy will be performed this morning by our Dr. Gordon . This afternoon we 'll summon witnesses . The inquest 's set for ten to-morrow morning . We 'll expect you there to help identify the body . Can Mr. Strangely come with you ? " Lawe hesitated . " I have n't seen him yet to-day , " he said at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness . " Well , get in touch with him if you can , " said MacDonald , " and tell him to drop in at my office some time this morning . A bright chap , this Strangely . " There was a pause , Lawe wondering how much the discovery of the body had changed the situation , and if he had better speak yet of finding the finger in Cumberland 's bed-room . He decided to wait until later . Better not talk about it over the telephone , anyhow . One never knew who was listening in . " By the way , " he said finally . " We literally stumbled on something last night . I 'll tell you when I see you later to-day . And , Inspector MacDonald , can you give orders at the Central Post to let me have some necessary information ? " " Certainly , Mr. Lawe . Nothing easier . I 'll call them at once .  | And I 'll see you this afternoon . Good-bye . " And the receiver was clicked up . When Lawe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his promise , already had telephoned . There was no trouble in getting all the desired information . He learned that there was , indeed , an eight p. m. daily collection at the pillar box just beyond Acacia Villas . The man on that route at present , however , was only a substitute , because the regular carrier had been given sick leave two days ago , and was confined to his home with a severe case of summer influenza . His name was John Watkins , and he lived at ro Baron 's Court . Lawe proceeded at once , by tube , to this address . Mrs. Watkins ? a frail , pallid woman  --  wearily opened the door . She was sorry , she said , to disappoint the gentleman , but Watkins was too ill to see anyone at present . In fact , he coughed so bad that the doctor had forbidden him to talk at all . Could the gentleman come back in a day or two ? There was nothing to be done , so Lawe reluctantly took his departure . Anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call on Mrs. O'Brien , and , while there , Lawe had no difficulty in eliciting the information that there had not been , for some time , a typing machine of any description in the house . He marvelled once more at the clear working of Strangely 's mind . Here , again , the man had hit upon a telling fact . True , an obvious one , but nevertheless one that ninety-nine persons out of a hundred would have allowed to pass unobserved . Still , there was always the hundredth person . This time it had been Strangely . Would MacDonald , too , have attached such importance to that chance remark , and to the incident of the brief-case ? Lawe thought not . Also , it seemed difficult to believe that so slight a clue could be followed up with any success . These thoughts were shooting at random through Lawe 's head as he talked to Mrs. O'Brien . After a bit of hesitation , he decided to follow Strangely 's exact advice , and to obtain any necessary information about the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . It was essential that he feel his way carefully . One false step now might ruin everything . After he left her , responding as best he could to her voluble good-byes , there was nothing more to be done until , at two p. m. , he presented himself at Strangely 's door . Tompkins , Strangely 's man  --  an ex-soldier  --  informed the caller , with an impassive face , that his master had not spent the night at home , though he had come in for a few minutes around ten o'clock the night before . He had not yet returned . Would Mr. Lawe step in , please ? Tompkins would consult the engagement hook on Mr. Strangely 's desk . Yes , there it was . " Lawe calling here two p. m . " Mr. Lawe had best wait a bit , for Mr. Strangely was always very careful about his appointments . Lawe sat down by the little library fire . The moments dragged , for he was nervous and distraught , but finally , owing probably to the soothing effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his sleeplessness of the night before , he gradually relaxed and fell into a doze . Waking some time later , he glanced quickly at the wall-clock , and was astounded to find that the hands pointed to three-thirty . he had slept for over an hour . Ringing for the puzzled Tompkins , Lawe informed him that he could wait no longer , and hastily set out for Mrs. Lugg 's lodging house . As he strode along , he considered the situation . Tompkins had said that it was utterly unlike his employer to break an engagetnent . " Only somethink of gravest importance could ' ave kept ' im , sir , " the man had said . Lawe 's mind did not care to dwell on the images conjured up by those words , " the gravest importance . " Strangely 's conversation of the night before recurred to him : " If Cumberland merely forgot that little token , instead of leaving it there purposely , he 's apt to return for it later . And it would be just too bad if no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strangely alone in that room with a desperate man  | floated through Lawe 's mind , and , consciously , he accelerated his steps . " God ! This is awful , " he muttered . As he rang the front door bell of Mrs. Lugg 's house on Gower Street , Dora  --  wide-eyed and frightened  --  tore open the door . She recoiled as she recognized him . " Oh , it 's you , sir , " she gasped . " I thought it was the orfficers ! " " The officers ! " echoed Lawe , seizing her shoulder with fingers of iron . " What 's been going on here ? Where 's Mr. Strangely ? the gentleman who rented room i6 last night ? " The girl looked up tearfully . " That 's wot we do n't know , sir . The gentleman did n't come to breakfast , and the bath water outside his door was n't touched . But we did n't think nothing of that , sir , for our young gentlemen has their own keys , and often comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was up at eleven to tidy his room , I knocked and there was n't no answer . And he did n't even come down for no lunch . At two o'clock the door was still shut and locked , and Mrs. Lugg and me , " her voice rose shrilly , " we pounded and yelled till we was hoarse , and there was n't no answer at all . We was afraid to open the door , so we called police headquarters . But they 're awful long in coming . I thought you was ? oh , there they are . That 's them now , sir ? " and she broke off at the sound of heavy tramping outside . Lawe , as in a dream , heard her respond to the officers ' queries ; heard her repeat her story reinforced by additional statements from the hysterical Mrs. Lugg ; heard himself introduced as the young gentleman who had accompanied the new lodger last night ; heard Dora recount how she had let both the gentlemen out last night and given Mr. Strangely his key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one return last night , but had found the bedroom door fast locked this morning , so thought the gentleman had come in very quiet to keep from waking up the other lodgers , and had gone to bed . " All right , all right , my girl , " said one of the two burly con-  | stables . " That 'll keep till you tell it at headquarters . Just show us the room . " His heart beating to suffocation , Lawe followed them up the now familiar stairs and down the hallway , pausing at the oak door he remembered . He saw the constables force the lock and open the door , watched frozenly from the threshhold  --  with Mrs. 1. ugg and Dora close behind  --  heard Dora 's scream , heard one of the constables grunt non-committally over some object on the bed , felt himself propelled forward . " Dead , all right , " said the foremost of the officers , rather as if he enjoyed making the statement . " Will you look now , sir , and identify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands across his eyes , Lawe managed to focus them upon the bed . Then , even as his numbed brain took in the fact that another form than Strangely 's lay before him , he heard Dora 's second piercing scream , and heard her cry : " My God , gentlemen ! That 's not Mr. Strangely . That 's Mr. Cumberland ! "  | VII STRANGELY DISAPPEARS IT WAS in a state of absolute mental exhaustion that Lawe finally reached Superintendent MacDonald 's private room at New Scotland Yard , and fell , rather than sank , into a chair . The last hour had been one of the worst he had ever experienced . His story had been gone over repeatedly by the two constables at Mrs. Lugg 's , and question after question had been fired at him in rapid succession . Had he known Mr. Cumberland ? Did he know how Mr. Cumberland had got back in the room ? Had Mr. Strangely expected him to return ? When had he , Lawe , last seen Mr. Strangely ? Where was Mr. Strangely now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't know ! " Then New Scotland Yard had been called and more officers sent from there . After that , all the stories had been repeated ? his own , Dora 's , Mrs. Lugg 's . More questions were asked , and the officers had been satisfied only when finally completely assured that this was only a new development of the Ravenelle case , which was already in the hands of Scotland Yard , and that Strangely and Lawe actually had been working together with the consent of Inspector MacDonald . At last , having come to the conclusion that Lawe was as mystified by the affair as they were themselves , and seeing that the shock of first nerving himself to view Strangely 's dead body , and then finding it to be that of Cumberland , had proved almost too much for the young man , the constables took Lawe 's address and allowed him to depart .  | His first act was to seek out Inspector MacDonald . Into that ! gentleman 's astounded ears he poured the entire story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started together for Mrs. O'Brien 's house , until the finding of Cumberland 's body in the room that he had vacated the night before , apparently for good . There seemed no further reason to conceal the finding of the severed finger in the man 's room the evening before . In fact , there was now every need of making the disclosure , and of explaining Strangely 's suspicions of Cumberland . Also the reason fair the visit to Mrs. Lugg 's lodging house and Strangely 's object in renting Cumberland 's vacated room . Inspector MacDonald listened spellbound . At Lawe 's reference to the stained towel , he nodded . At the dramatic discovery of the finger , he gave an astonished whistle . And , when Geoffrey reached the point where Strangely had stumbled upon what he considered to be proof of some connection between the Ravenelles and the yacht Wall-Flower , he banged his fist fiercely down upon the desk . " Mr. Lawe , " he said sternly , " You and Mr. Strangely did very wrong to keep this information to yourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in order to have the pleasure of trapping the criminal through his own efforts . But , no matter what he asked you to do , you should have told all this to me at once . Our men trailed Cumberland halfway across the city last night on a wild-goose chase . He stopped at one pub after another , and then they lost him in the fog . In his inebriated condition , the man probably forgot that he had given up his key , and so went hack to his room . But how did he get in ? Allowing for the fog and all , he would have arrived there about midnight , for the pubs close at eleven . Mrs. Lugg 's door certainly would be locked by then . Yet he got in , and no one seems to have heard him . Of course , having lost him in the fog , our men had no idea that he would do such a thing . Nor could they dream that Mr. Strangely would rent that room for the night . When Cumberland left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . But if  | you had come to us at once with the information that Mr. Strangely was stopping the night in Cumberland 's vacated room , we would have renewed that watch , of course . And there would have been a slightly different tale to tell ! " Look at the results of your silence . Cumberland , our best hope of information , is done in ( we have felt certain that , sooner or later , he would lead us to the girl or her body ) , and no doubt the Wall-Flower has flown , taking this Smith ' , whoever he may be , with it . Then , the Lord only knows what 's become of Mr. Strangely ! It 's certain we 're working against a very clever force , and there 's no time to lose ! " He grabbed the telephone impatiently . " The thing 's a proper puzzle , " he continued moodily , his foot tapping impatiently while he waited for his connection . He was pulling at his close-clipped gray mustache , and his usually genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information of yours , " he said , " there 's small doubt that Smith ' is one of the ones we want . I agree that the fact of the word Ravenelle 's meaning Wall-Flower , and of that word 's being underscored in Rilla Ravenelle 's French dictionary , in conjunction with the notice in the paper ( also belonging to her ) that a yacht called Wall-Flower has entered Folkestone harbor , is too connected a chain of incidents to be thrown aside as mere coincidence . Mr. Strangely is clever , remarkably clever ? but he made a grave mistake in keeping this information away from me . Of course , young Cumberland was implicated in the disappearance of the girl . We 've been trying to link him up with it from the start . Now , this affair of the finger in his room shows that ? ' " But Mr. MacDonald , " interrupted Lawe doggedly , " it did n't look to me like Rilla 's finger . It was n't her finger . It must have belonged to someone else ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said MacDonald sharply . " Whose else could it be ? Just tell me that . A girl disappears . Her cousin 's room is searched , and a finger is found there  --  a woman 's finger , from all indications . No ! There , also , we have too much of a  | coincidence . If the man was n't dead himself now  --  murdered ? I 'd say he killed the girl . But this way , it looks as if some one else did the job , planted the finger in Cumberland 's room , and then later got rid of him , too . There 's not much doubt that the body of the girl found on the enbankment is that of Rilla RavenWe ? ( Hello , hello , yes , I say ? 22 , 39 , 46 ) . As I see it , in the light of these new developments , the murders were both done by the same person . For some reason that person wanted Miss Ravenelle out of the way , lured her to the spot where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm afraid you 've got to face it , Mr. Lawe . Rilla Ravenelle and the girl on the embankment are one and the same . And there may have been robbery as well as murder ! " " But Miss Ravenelle was a poor girl , " objected Lawe , sure of his ground now . " There could have been no motive for robbery ! " MacDonald cocked his head knowingly . " It 's not always a thing of money value that 's stolen , " he said . " Miss Ravenelle may have had in her possession something that the murderer was very anxious to get . Think of that finger in Cumberland 's room ! What motive does anyone have in cutting off a finger ? Why , to get a ring that fits too tight , that 's what ! " Lawe started . " Now , did Miss Ravenelle ever wear a ring of any kind ? " continued MacDonald . " She , " began Lawe , but broke off as the Inspector rattled the phone and spoke violently into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he rasped . " Is this Arden , at holkestone ? Can you tell me if the yacht Wall-Flower  --  yes , Wall-Flower , WALL-FLOWER  --  has weighed anchor ? " A moment 's pause while a thin , faint voice could be heard coming over the line in reply . " All right , all right , that 's all I want to know . See if you can pick her up along the coast . It 's important . Yes , most important . Just as I thought , " he added , hanging up the receiver and turning to Lawe . " The yacht sailed at day-break . But never mind , Mr. I.awe , " he hastened to say , as he noted Lawe 's pale face , " you  | thought you were doing all right . Mr. Strangely asked you not to tell me till to-day . That was a great mistake , but we 'll get them yet . Scotland Yard has a long arm . Just how long , most people will never know . Our coast agents will do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's plenty for us to do right here . The Wall-Flower must have had warning from someone who was pretty well posted about things , right here in London . And it 's our business to find out who that someone was ! It seems to me if we find that out , we 're pretty close to finding the murderer of Rilla Ravenelle and Cumberland , too . Both were killed by strangulation , Cumberland and the girl on the embankment . The sameness of method points to one person . That person must have returned to Cumberland 's room to get the finger . About that time Cumberland himself came rolling in , pretty drunk . This chap had likely been thinking Cumberland knew far too much for his own good , anyhow  --  about the murder of the Ravenelle girl , for instance . He saw a good way to get rid of Cumberland , instead of just casting suspicion on him as he had intended at first . So he finished him up the quickest way possible . Then he warned the Wall-Flower somehow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But , Mr. MacDonald , " cried Lawe . " If this is true , where was Strangely all that time ? Where was he ? Where is he now ? Why did n't he go back to Cumberland 's room just as he had planned ? " " Perhaps he did go back , " replied Inspector MacDonald slowly . " Perhaps he did . There 's always just that chance . Perhaps he found Cumberland there . Perhaps , in a drunken rage , Cumberland attacked Strangely . And perhaps Strangely killed him in self-defense ! You 've no idea at all of Mr. Strangely 's where-abouts ? " " None at all ! " cried Lawe , who had started from his seat , at the Inspector 's words . " We parted before ten last night . He asked me to perform two commissions for him the next day . He said he was going immediately to his laboratory to examine the stains on the towel he took from Mrs. Lugg 's house . Then he  | intended to return to Cumberland 's room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that he returned to the laboratory for a few minutes , but left again . From then on , I know absolutely nothing about him . Until this afternoon , I thought he had spent the night in Cumberland 's room ! " " ' Phis man Tompkins , " said MacDonald slowly . " Where did you sec him ? " " At Strangely 's own rooms ( I thought I told you that ) at two p. tn . I waited till three-thirty and then left . " MacDonald was beating a little tattoo with his fingers . " You say Mr. Strangely did n't seem to think the stain on the towel was blood ? " he asked at last . " What did he think it was ? " " I do n't know , " replied Lawe . " But he seemed to have some very definite idea . He said he 'd tell me later . " " I wish we had those things , " continued MacDonald grimly . " ( ) f course , they may be in his laboratory . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the day is over . This disappearance of his certainly complicates affairs at this juncture . You say he gave you some commissions to perform this morning ? What were they ? I daresay they may have had something to do with his telephone message to me last night . " It was Lawe 's turn to look astonished . " I Iis telephone message last night ! " he broke in sharply . " What do you mean ? " " Just that , Mr. Lawe , " said MacDonald drily . " This morning , what with viewing the girl 's body and all , I forgot to speak of it when you telephoned to me . At that , it did n't seem to make much sense . He asked us to set about finding if there was a typewriting machine at Mrs. O'Brien 's , and to get the address on the letter she mailed the night of Rilla Ravenelle 's disappearance . Did he speak of it to you ? " " Yes , " said Lawe quickly . " Those . were the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized , in the light of his message , that was the reason I wanted you to vouch for me at the Central Post . But it seems such a small thing to me . I ca n't think anything will come of it . "  | " Well , you never can tell . Both requests seemed very odd . If it were anybody but Mr. Strangely ? " he finished with a shrug . " What time did he call you ? " " Very shortly after ten last evening . I do n't know where he was when he telephoned , but it should be easy to trace the call . I daresay he informed me , thinking you were in such an overwrought state you might forget . But what beats me , is that he did n't mention the really important things  --  the yacht , and the finger , and all that . Well , what was his theory about the typewriting machine ? " " He seemed to have some odd idea about Miss Ravenelle , " explained Lawe reluctantly . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her handbag , to do at night . And Strangely did n't happen to see any typewriter on the premises , so he told me to find out if there were one . As a matter of fact , there 's not . But it seems a matter of such small importance . As a matter of fact , I 'm really not sure she told me she was taking work home . I may just have taken it for granted when I saw her bag . " " M-Mm . And what was Strangely 's idea ? " " Oh , he had some far-fetched idea that she might have been carrying home something of value to our firm . I ask you , what could she have taken home that would injure us in any way ? Our accounts are quite in order , and I ca n't imagine Rilla being interested enough in the sales records of a tea and coffee import business , to carry duplicates home with her at night . There 's no particular excitement in that , you know . Besides , Miss Ravenelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was taking work home ( which I 'm not absolutely sure she did say ) then she was taking it home , and she had access to some machine we do n't know about . That 's all . I ca n't understand Strangely making such a point of it , and I told him so at the time . It 's so utterly foolish . He 's on a false trail there . " Lawe 's tones were decided . " And what was the information you wanted at the Central Post ? " inquired Inspector MacDonald non-committally . " Just what I told you  --  about the address on the letter Mrs. O'Brien posted on the evening of July 17th  --  the evening Rilla  | disappeared , " answered Lawe . " But I do n't quite get his idea there , either . Last night I thought there might be something in it . But to-day , when I saw the woman again , it seemed impossible to link her up with any crime . " " She 's not the criminal type , " agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll look into this letter business later . Mr. Strangely undoubtedly thought he was on the track of something . Perhaps he 'll turn up himself and tell us what it was . Now , as to the girl 's father . He 's a queer duck and will bear watching . I could n't get much out of him , but he 'll be at the inquest . We 're sending two men in a cab , to bring him along . But you 're looking had , Mr. Lawe . We 'll just call Mr. Strangely 's rooms to see if he 's got back , and then I think you 'd better go home . " A call to Strangely 's residence elicited the information that he had not yet returned , although it was now well after six o'clock . The Inspector hung up with a puzzled air . " f ca n't understand it , " he said . " He should have showed up by this time , in any case . If he knew anything about Cumberland 's murder ( I mean if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to tell us . And if he did n't know anything about it , he 'd have been around anyhow to say how he 'd got on . I do n't like it . I do n't like it at all . " Geoffrey did n't like it , either . The affair each moment was taking on a grimmer and darker aspect . He could think of absolutely no reason to account for Strangely 's non-appearance . As Inspector MacDonald said , even if the man had killed Cumberland in self-defense , he would have turned up to inform them of the fact , knowing that the law was all on his side in such a case . " Perhaps he 's following up some clue , " he said , " and will turn up in time for the inquest to-morrow . If he does n't  --  well , he ? may have met with foul play himself . He had that finger in his possession , you know , and the towel ! " " Quite so , " said MacDonald briefly . " By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to know . " He tapped thoughtfully on his teeth with his pencil-point . " Do n't take my question amiss , Mr. Lawe . But you 've given me to understand , from one thing  | and another , that you had quite a personal interest in the deceasthat is , in the missing young lady . " " I did , Mr. MacDonald . I wished  --  I wish  --  to make her my wife . " " Quite so . And Mr. Lawe , senior  --  he approved ? " " No , " replied Geoffrey formally . " He did not . " " But there had been no attempt on his part to buy the young lady off ? " " My heavens , no ! " cried Lawe . " It was n't that kind of an affaiI ! " Inspector MacDonald 's face remained blank . Perhaps , to his mind , every affair of the kind was that kind of affair . " I see , " he said finally . " And now , Mr. Lawe , I interrupted you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me something . Did Miss Ravenelle ever wear a ring on the third finger of either hand ? " Lawe shook his head . " No , " he said firmly . " Never ! "  | VIII INQUESTS INSPECTOR MACDONALD 'S fears concerning Strangely were augmented the next day when the latter had not yet appeared at the time set for the inquest upon the body of the unfortunate girl found upon the embankment . It had been all that Lawe could do to view the remains , and he staggered slightly as he walked from the mortuary . MacDonald regarded the young man with kindly eyes as they walked through the curious crowd in the inquest room and took seats near the front , among those reserved for witnesses . The room was brought to order promptly at ten a. m. , the magistrate informing the jury rather pompously that their first duty was to identify the unfortunate victim they had just viewed , as the missing girl , Rilla Ravenelle. 1 ) r . Allen , the police doctor who had performed the autopsy , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had examined the body and had found that death was due to strangulation . He could say positively that it was the delicately built body of a young woman of eighteen or twenty years of age . The skin was fair and of fine texture . In the body 's mutilated condition , it was impossible to determine exactly whether the victim had been a blond or a brunette . While the fairness of the skin led him to believe that the girl was blonde , nevertheless the same extremely white skin sometimes accompanied a certain black-haired type . The young woman had been dead , to the best of his knowledge , four or five days . An autopsy had been performed . No traces of poison were discovered , but traces of food still remaining in the victim 's stomach had been analyzed  | as undigested remnants of pineapple and mushrooms . He had nothing further to say . Dr. Shepherd , of 17 Wimpole Street , was then called . He testified that , some months before , Rilla Ravenelle had come to him for a physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the firm of Lawe &; Son , which required a certificate of health from all employees . Yes , he had known the young woman by sight before this , as Acacia Villas is not far from Wimpole Street . He had noticed her a number of times on the street , and had remarked her unusual beauty . Yes , he had viewed the remains of the murdered girl in the mortuary . He was unable to identify the victim absolutely as Miss Ravenelle , but he could definitely say that she had been of the same age and build , and that her skin had been of the same fair , fine texture . Under close questioning he admitted that the body might well be that of the missing girl . He was then dismissed , in view of an urgent case he was obliged to attend . Mrs. O'Brien , pale and agitated , was then put on the witness stand merely long enough to testify that on the evening of July 17th  --  the date of Rilla Ravenelle 's disappearance  --  she had cooked supper as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the articles of food served at this supper , there had been pineapple with custard . And , as a little extra treat , ( her voice faltered ) she had served mushrooms on toast . ( An audible murmur here , from the listeners . ) No , it was not her custom to serve things of that kind to her lodgers always , but every once in a while when she saw something extra nice on the market , she did n't think it did any harm to give them a little treat . That day the mushrooms had looked so good that she 'd taken them home and given everybody a taste of them at supper . She was sure it was on July 17th that she had done this ? Yes , she was sure of it ? Monday , July 17th , the day Rilla Ravenelle disappeared . Yes , the missing girl ( again her voice faltered ) had eaten both the pineapple sweet and the mushrooms . She had been particularly fond of both . The witness was then temporarily dismissed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | The next witness was one Ella Franks , assistant in Dr. Shepherd 's office . She testified that she had known Rilla Ravenelle for a little over half a year , having seen her for the first time when she came to the doctor 's office for examination . They had talked together for some time while Miss Ravenelle waited for her turn , and she had been much attracted to the girl . More or less of a friendship had sprung up . When asked what she meant by more or less of a friendship , Miss Franks replied : " Well , Rilla never was one for getting intimate . We walked together sometimes , and we went to the cinema twice . " No , she had not seen Rilla on the day of her disappearance , but she had seen her two days before . How did she remember the day ? Because it was Saturday afternoon and Dr. Shepherd had let her go early in order to see a dentist  --  she had a new plate and it had been troubling her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had met Rilla in the lower hall . Rilla 's firm did n't work on Saturday afternoons in summer . Rilla had seemed upset . She looked worried about something , and she had been crying . At this point , there was a slight sensation . " Did you ask her what was the matter ? " " Yes , sir , I did . " " And what did she tell you ? " " She said someone she loved was unworthy ! " An audible gasp from the room . " Did she name that person ? " " No , she did n't . " " Have you , yourself , any idea who it was ? " " No , sir , I have n't . I did n't know who any of her other friends were . That 's the most she ever said to me about her personal affairs . " " And that is all you know ? " " Yes , sir , that 's all . " The witness was dismissed . The next person summoned was Basil Ravenelle himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched with ill-suppressed  | curiosity as the old gentleman was helped by two burly constables into the witness chair . His striking face was pinched and waxen , and his hand , as he raised it to swear , was so thin as to be almost transparent . The witness testified that he and his daughter , Rilla , had lived for eight years with Mrs. O'Brien . Before living in London , they had lived in Europe . They had travelled a great deal from one place to another ; he had been stronger then . What had his work been there ? He had been a  --  translator . He had come to London thinking there might be some work of the kind for him there . He spoke several languages fluently . How had they happened to choose Mrs. O'Brien 's lodging house ? Well , it was a stormy night , and cold . He had lost the address of the boarding-house they were hunting . He had been ill . His strength gave out . He and his child had been glad enough to take shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger . No , they had never seen this man before . " Did you not hesitate to take your young daughter into a house of which you knew nothing ? " he was asked . " I can not say that I did . I knew nothing of London . Although I am English , I had never lived much in England . We were in a half-frozen state . I was glad of any friendly hand held out . It seemed quite natural , under the circumstances . " " And you never saw this man again ? " There was the barest possible hesitation . Then : " Never , " said Basil Ravenelle firmly . " Your daughter has been employed for some months , Mr. Ravenelle ? Finding that your funds were no longer adequate , it was necessary for her to work ? Is that right ? " A slight flush rose to the pale brow of the witness . " Quite right , " he replied colorlessly . " And before that time , what means of support had you ? " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain dignity . " Unessential as concerning the disappearance of my daughter ? "  | " Certainly not , " replied the Magistrate with an air , " else I should not ask . " " In that case , " explained the invalid painfully , " I must explain that I had a few very valuable jewels which had belonged to my wife . We were not always so impoverished . Circumstances at last forced me to sell them . " " And the money derived from those jewels lasted you for all those years ? " The Magistrates tones were incredulous . " Yes . " " They must have been very valuable jewels , Mr. Ravenelle ! " " They were , " said Ravenelle calmly . " You had , then , no monetary aid from any other source ? " " No . " " Not from translating work , as you had anticipated ? " " No . " " Nor from anything else ? " " No . " " We have been informed that for some time you received money in letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Magistrate looked frustrated , rustled some papers . " Now , Mr. Ravenelle , " he began briskly once more , " when was the last time that you saw your daughter ? " The witness grew even paler , if possible . His carven lips seemed bloodless . " About 7:45 on the evening of July 17th , last , " he replied at length , with some difficulty . " She helped me to bed and told me that she was going out . " " Did she say where she was going ? " " No . " " Was not this odd ? " " I did not consider it so . " " Did she say with whom she was going ? " " She did not  --  I assumed she was going alone . " " When did you discover her absence ? "  | " You mean when did I discover that she had not returned that night ? " " Certainly , that is what I mean . " The Magistrate tapped rather annoyedly with one foot . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight the next morning , when she had not come to my room as usual . I dragged myself to her door . Her bed had not been slept in . " " You have viewed the remains in the mortuary , Mr. Ravenelle ? " A slight shudder shook the frail frame . " Yes . " " Can you identify them as those of your daughter , Rilla Raven-elle ? " " I can not . " " But they might be hers ? " " They might be  --  yes . " The Magistrate inspected his notes . " Your daughter had enemies ? " " None that I know of . " " Then you believe she may have had some you did not know ? " " I did not mean that . I only meant I knew of none . " " You have no idea who could have desired to put her out of the way ? " There was a tortured expression in the old man 's eyes . " No . " Had there been the barest hesitation before that mono-syllable ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever heard of a yacht called the Wall-Flower ? " The question was fired unexpectedly , but Superintendent MacDonald , who was watching the witness closely , could not see that he flicked an eyelash . " No. " was the reply . " Or of a man called Smith who owns her ? " " No . " The witness was then helped down , and Mrs. O'Brien again  | took the chair . She still looked agitated and ill at ease , but repeated in detail the story of the Ravenelles ' arrival at her lodging house eight years previously , their life during their residence with her , and , finally , her words with Rilla Ravenelle on the fatal night . At this juncture the Magistrate again consulted his voluminous notes . " You have said that you had been to the pillar box to post a letter , Mrs. O'Brien . Now , to whom was that letter written ? " Mrs. O'Brien swallowed hard . " To the Elite Employment Agency , sir , on Euston Road , asking diem to send me another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . The shiftless good-for-nothing , more concerned with her looks than The Magistrate rapped sharply . " Ruled out , " he said , " as irrelevant . " Lawe and MacDonald , who had been leaning forward at the mention of the letter now sank back again in disappointment . " Now , Mrs. O'Brien , " continued the Magistrate , " Dr. Shepherd has testified that the autopsy produced traces of pineapple and mushrooms . You yourself have previously testified that the missing girl consumed these articles of diet at her supper on the evening of her disappearance . Is there anything more that you care to say in this connection ? " " Why  --  no , sir , " faltered the landlady . " It 's the truth I 'm after spcakin ' when I say she ate them . But then ? , " she stopped short , still with a puzzled expression on her round , flushed face . " But what , Mrs. O'Brien ? " But we all did that same , sir , " she ended weakly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening closely , had a strong sense that this was not what the woman had started to say . He made a mental note to question her further on this subject later on . Mrs. O'Brien was then brought down from the witness stand , and a long-drawn sigh escaped the tense listeners as Geoffrey awe was next sworn in . They could see that he was laboring  | under a terrible strain , but his answers were crisp and concise . He told of his friendship with Rilla Ravenelle and his anxiety over her disappearance , anxiety which had led him first to Scotland Yard , and then to the American scientist and detective , Peter Strangely . During these words , the roomful of people leaned forward as one man , breathless with interest . Lawe steadily described his activities of two nights before in company with Strangely , and tension was at the breaking point when he described the scene in Mrs. Lugg 's lodging house just after Cumberland had driven away in the cab . " You say that Mr. Strangely took the finger and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He did . " " Where is Mr. Strangely now ? " " I do n't know . " Another ripple of excitement . MacDonald now bustled up to the front of the room , and whispered hurriedly in the Magistrate 's ear . After a moment the examination continued , but not until the Magistrate informed the jury ( all ears now ) that Mr. Strangely 's laboratory , upon being thoroughly searched only a short time before , had yielded up no sign of either finger or towel . He might well have told them that the entire place had been thoroughly fine-combed , all three of Strangely 's living-rooms as well as his laboratory , much to the horror of the law-abiding Tompkins . Towel and finger had disappeared off the face of the earth . The inquest went on . " Now , Mr. Lawe , have you any idea what was on that towel ? " " It was a dark stain . I thought it was blood . " A gasp from the auditors . " But Mr. Strangely did not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did he tell you what he thought it to be ? " " He said he would tell me later . " Subdued whispering . The Magistrate rapped for order , and read his notes .  | " You say Mr. Strangely thought the finger was the middle one of the right hand ? " " ' Ilhat 's what he said . " " 1N hat led him to think this ? " " It was something about the ligamentary attachments , I behove . And then he thought he could distinguish an ink-stain at the tip ! " Me Magistrate looked down his nose in an owlish way , to conceal the fact that he was making nothing of the testimony . Then : " You say that Mr. Strangely left you at nine-thirty the night Ix.lore last  --  July loth that was ? " " Yes . " " I k was going to his home ? " " Yes . " " And then to Mrs. Lugg 's rooming-house  --  to the room just vacated that night by Ralph Cumberland ? " " I understood that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You say led me to believe . ' Can you remember Mr. Strangely 's own words in regard to his intentions ? " " I think I can . He said I 've paid for the room , so I might as well occupy it . Besides , if Cumberland forgot this little token , he 'll be back for it . And it would be just too bad if no one were there to receive him ' . " Lawe recited the words automatically in the midst of a tense silence , so thick that it could have been cut with a knife . The news of Cumberland 's murder was by this time universally known . Few in the room were unacquainted with the fate of the young man who had been Rilla Ravenelle 's cousin , and , during Lawe 's words , the newspaper men in the front row were scribbling furiously . " You have viewed the remains of the body found on the embankment , Mr. Lawe ? " I.awe swayed slightly . " Yes . "  | " You can identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , I can not , " the reply fell sharply on the silence . " I do not believe them to be hers ! " " But you have no definite reason for this conviction ? " " I  --  I feel that they are not . That is all . They can not be ! " Lawe left the stand and returned to his seat beside Inspector MacDonald , in the midst of a deep hush . Lawe , Senior , was next called and replied in frigid monosyllables to all questions . His broad face , with its deep-set eyes , was fixed in stubborn lines , and his glance passed straight over the head of his son . The missing girl had been employed in his offices ? Yes . He did not know her well ? No . Then she did not take his dictation ? No . He had objected to his son Geoffrey 's attentions to this girl ? Yes . Had his son been aware of this fact ? Yes . ( Grimly . ) Yet the young man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps  --  been discussion about it ? In fact , scenes ? Yes . Had the witness seen this girl on Monday , July 17th , the day of her disappearance ? No , he had not . No , he did not know where she went after she left the offices of Lawe &; Son . No , he had never made an attempt to buy her off . No , no , no , he knew nothing whatever about her . His son was an ungrateful pup . ( This remark ruled out . ) Yes , he had viewed the remains in the mortuary . Yes , it might very well be those of the girl , Rilla Ravenelle . No , he could n't say certainly . He did n't know . He stalked down from the witness stand to his chair in the front of the room .  | The last two witnesses were Ruth Wilson and Elsa Berry , typists from the firm of Lawe &; Son and acquaintances of Rilla Ravenelle . Their evidence was of no particular importance . They had known Rilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had always been friendly with her . She was a very lady-like girl  --  a nice , pleasant manner . Very cheerfullooking . She always carried a brief-case home at night . Outside work , they thought . She had said nothing to either of them about any trouble . But on the day of July 17th she had seemed a bit distracted like , and she had n't shown up for work the next day . " You mean she was crying or something ? " " Oh , no , sir . Just sort of big-eyed and quiet . " Both witnesses had viewed the body in the mortuary . Both feared it was that of Rilla Ravenelle . After a few more perfunctory questions , both witnesses were dismissed , Elsa Berry sobbing softly , and the evidence was summed up by the Magistrate for the benefit of the jury . This body of gentlemen needed only ten minutes for deliberation . The pineapple-and-mushroom item of evidence had turned the trick . The jury begged to inform the court of their conviction that the mutilated body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rilla Ravenelle , and that she had died , by strangulation , at the hands of person or persons unknown ! The inquest of Ralph Cumberland , set for the afternoon of the same day , was uneventful . There was a decided lack of evidence , and , after the exciting session of the morning , very little of interest to the spectators . Actual guilt could be fastened on no one , though among some of the jurors there evidently was a leaning toward the theory that Peter Strangely had killed Ralph Cumberland in self-defense . Here again , however , a snag was struck . St ' . Ingely had indeed mentioned his intention of returning to the room on Gower Street , but no one could be found who had seen him either enter or leave after Dora had said good-night to him  | about nine p. m. , when he left Mrs. Lugg 's house accompanied by Geoffrey Lawe . Tompkins , Strangely 's man-servant , was put on the stand . He testified briefly that Mr. Strangely had returned home around ten p. m. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes in his laboratory , and had then sent Tompkins to bed , saying that he was leaving the house again and would let himself out . " You say this occurred at what hour ? " " He returned about ten , sir . I could n't be exactly sure what time he left again , sir . He said not to wait up . I put the door on the latch and went to bed . " " But you heard him leave the house ? " " Oh , yes , sir . But I did n't light the light to look at the time . " " You have had no word from him since ? " " No word , sir . " " Now , Tompkins , you have been with Mr. Strangely how long ? " " Ten years , sir . Ever since he come to London . " " He was a methodical man ? It was not his habit to break engagements ? " " Oh , no , sir ! Mr. Strangely is most prompt and particular , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawe ? " " Yes , sir . The engagement was marked on his note-book , sir . " And he sent no word of explanation ? " " No , sir . " " Very well , Tompkins . That will do . " Tompkins was then dismissed and the evidence summed up . This time the jury needed more deliberation . Finally the verdict was handed in of murder , through strangulation , by person or persons unknown . By nightfall , the papers were informing eager readers , by means of great scareheads , of three important facts :  | The body on the embankment was that of Rilla Ravenelle . The murder of Rilla Ravenelle and the murder of Ralph Cumberland probably were connected with each other . Peter Strangely was still missing .  | IX ALL ABOUT MARTIE THE next morning Inspector MacDonald called Lawe on the telephone at an early hour . Although it was Sunday , he had gone to his office as usual . " There 's no particular reason to believe that Mrs. O'Brien lied about that letter to the Elite Employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not quite satisfied . Mr. Strangely making such a point of it , and all . He may have had some strong reason for stressing the point . At any rate , I 've a feeling that something is going on there that we do n't know about . You 'd be doing me a great favor if you 'd look up Watkins , the postman , again , and then report to me . " " Righto , " agreed Lawe , a worried expression appearing in his eyes . " You think she actually was holding something back ? " " I do n't know , " admitted MacDonald candidly , " but there 's something queer about it . I 'm not satisfied . And Ravenelle himself  --  well , I 'll talk of all that when I see you . Four o'clock this afternoon . Still no word from Mr. Strangely ? " " Still no word . " " It 's damn queer , all right , the whole thing . Well , good-bye , " and he rang off . It was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube to Baron 's Court . In fact , it was a situation that had kept him lying sleepless most of the night before . Where was Strangely ? Why this unbroken silence on his part ? Was he living ? Was he dead ? If he were living , what was his reason for keeping out of sight ? It must be a strong one , unless  | were a prisoner somewhere . What had he learned further ut the affair ? There was no answer to any of these questions . At Baron 's Court , Lawe climbed the tube stairway , and walked rapidly to the home of John Watkins , the postman . To-day the man was better , and Mrs. Watkins , wreathed in smiles , ushered Lawe into a plain , untidy bed-room . There he found the sick man , a dark fever-flush on his thin face , propped up in bed and breathing heavily . " I wo n't keep you a minute , Mr. Watkins , " explained the visitor pleasantly . " But , as they will tell you at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you . There 's a little case of petty larceny being investigated by the police . Nothing much , but we feel that possibly you can give us a piece of Information which we need . Now then , Mr. Watkins  --  last Monay night , did a certain Mrs. O'Brien hand you a letter for the eight p. m. collection near Acacia Villas ? " " Mrs. O'Brien ! " cried Watkins in a hoarse whisper . " Why , she 's an honest woman , sir . Surely you do n't think she 'd steal ! " Lawe bit his lip in annoyance . " Now , now , " he admonished the sick man , " I 'm afraid I 'll be thrown out if you excite yourself . No , indeed ! We do n't suspect Mrs. O'Brien of any connection whatsoever with the theft . In fact  --  in a way  --  you 'd be helping her out if you could tell me what I want to know . " The man 's face brightened . " Oh , in that case , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For she 's a real nice old body . I would n't like to say anything which might be used against her . Yes , sir , I call the incident to mind perfect , for she come running just as I was about to close the box and move on . We stood and chatted for a minute , about the hard luck she 's had , having to dismiss her maid , and so on ? a hit of neighborhood gossip  --  and then she turned back . But , begging your pardon , sir  --  it was n't one letter she give me that night . It was two ! " Lawe started . Two ! Two letters ! Then Strangely was right . Mrs. O'Brien had held something back . But why ? And to  | whom was the second letter written ? A dim suspicion began to form at the back of Lawe 's mind . A suspicion he had earlier entertained and then rejected after hearing Mrs. O'Brien 's evidence on the witness stand . " Two letters , " he repeated slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Watkins . Think well . Did you happen to notice the address on either of those letters ? " " I ? , " began the man , but a violent coughing spell seized him , and he was obliged to pause while he struggled for breath . " My breathing ai n't none too good since this hit me , " he apologized painfully when he was able to speak . " Take your time , Mr. Watkins , " said Lawe , outwardly patient , inwardly seething . " Well , it was this way , " panted the man at last . " At eight o'clock these here days , there 's still a goodish bit of daylight left . In fact , I 've knowed it to stay light out of doors on a clear day in summer till nine-thirty or so . Though that 's unusual . Well , Mrs. O'Brien she give me the letters and we talked a bit about what servants was these times and so on  --  employment agencies and the like . And , after she 'd gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd wrote to find help . You understand it ai n't usual with me , sir . But the letters was face up , and  --  well , I looked first at the one on top " And that was ? " prompted Lawe , leaning forward . " Oh , ' t was to some employment bureau on Euston Road  --  yes , that 's right  --  Elite Employment Agency . And then I looked at the other one , but ? " " Yes , yes ? " " But , just for the minute , sir , I ca n't remember what it was . " Then , as Lawe sank back with a gesture of disappointment . " But I will , sir . My memory 's good . Only this here illness has knocked it outa my mind . You know how it is yourself , sir , sometimes . Once in a while something 'll seem to stamp itself on your mind for no particular reason . ' T was that way with the address on that letter . Yet now I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of something when I read it  --  Temple Bar , that 's what  --  though I  | ' t think why . It 's gone , just like that . " He sank back , drawshort , harsh breaths . " ' Temple Bar ? That 's odd , " replied Lawe quickly . " But can u tell me this much . Was the address in London ? " Watkins nodded his head affirmatively . " Yes , sir . That I do remember . Both addresses was London . nil the street  --  I almost had it . Well , never mind . Just rest easy , sir . It 'll come back to me . And , when it does , I 'll let you know . " " Yes , do , " answered Lawe , scribbling rapidly on a piece of pct . " Just drop a line to this name and address , simply a line ying that you have remembered  --  nothing else  --  and I will come t here again . And , Mr. Watkins , not a word of this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You understand ? " " Oh , yes , sir , I quite understand , " and Watkins smiled with Me importance . " Just give the card to my wife , sir , as you go t . She 'll put it away . " Lawe walked away from the house , his brows knitted in khought . The name he had left was that of his valet , Simmons , for his own name had figured rather prominently in the newspers of late , as an employer of the missing Rilla Ravenelle. we did not wish Watkins to suspect that any information he Eve might be used in a sensational murder case . The man might frightened off , under such circumstances , refuse to speak . For the same reason , he had not been frank about the object of his visit , and professed to be investigating a case of petty larceny . He knew that persons of the Watkins type are unduly frightened at the thought of any connection with the law , and also stubbornly clannish concerning others of their own class  --  Mrs. O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was apt to shut up like a clam . And Lawe was anxious that no such contretemps should occur at this juncture . As for Mrs. O'Brien , what possible motive could she have for holding back any information about the second letter ? What was her object ? Lawe would have given a great deal to know . Suppose Watkins were unable , after all , to remember the ad-  | dress . There would be no other way of finding it out , unless Mrs. O'Brien could be induced to  --  perhaps it would be best to go to her directly , now , and have it out . Possibly he could force her into telling . Many a daring frontal attack had won out when strategy failed . With sudden resolve , he deflected his course towards Bloomsbury and Acacia Villas . There he found Mrs. O'Brien in her little living-room , bustling busily about with broom and duster . She greeted him in her usual cheerful fashion , but Lawe brushed her words brusquely aside . " Mrs. O'Brien , " he demanded peremptorily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to your trip to the pillar box on the night of Monday , July 17th ? Why did you keep something back ? " The little Irish-woman reddened angrily . " Lie , is it ? " she cried belligerently , standing with arms akimbo . " There 's never a wor-rd but truth that I 've told ! Pillar box , is it ? Of course , I went to the pillar box . And who should know better ? For it 's not every day I 'm after writing a letter . To the Elite Employment Agency , Euston Road  --  that 's where I wrote ! And who shall say I did n't ? " she ended defiantly . " No one , " replied Lawe curtly . " That 's all quite true  --  as far as you go . Oh , you were wise enough to use a portion of the truth to bear you out ; " he added . " Clever . Very clever . But that 's not all ! And you know it 's not all , Mrs. O'Brien . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mrs. O'Brien 's jaw dropped . " God bless my soul ! " she cried , and heartiest conviction was in her voice . " I 'd clean forgot it , Mr. Lawe ! You see , this was the way of it . It was n't my letter , at all , at all ! " Lawe stepped suddenly forward , his whole attitude tense with expectation . " Not  --  not your letter ? What do you mean ? " " I mean just that , sir . I 'd wrote my own letter to the Agency , and , knowing that the carrier reached the corner pillar box roundabout eight p. m . I 'd sat waitin ' for him to make his rounds .  | hen I see him turn the corner , I grabbed up me little old shawl and was just to the door , when who should call out but Martie ? Martie Green , you know , my housemaid , the lass I 'd sent packing ? and says she to me in her pert way , Well , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she says , perhaps you 're not too good to mail my letter , anyway ! ' I was angry , you may believe , but I the letter and handed it in with me own , for , true enough , she was packing her boxes . And I 'd clean forgot it until this moment ! " Although her tone was frank , Lawe leaped to his feet , eyes flashing . " You will swear to that , Mrs. O'Brien ? Swear you forgot it till now ? " " That I will , Mr. Lawe ! " " Then , " his voice was hard , " do n't tell me you did n't read the address on this letter . No trifling now . Did you , or did you not , read the address on this girl Martie 's letter ? " The landlady shook her head angrily . " There 's no need to take that tone with me , Mr. Lawe , sir . And who are you , to order a poor lone widow about ? One would think I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm as anxious as yourself to clear things up , but how was I to know , pray tell , how annything written by that huzzy would be of importance to annyone but herself ? Why , Miss Rilla had n't even disappeared then ! As a matter of fact , " she ended candidly , " it did wonder me a bit to know whom the girl would be writing to at all , so I up and looked at the letter as I passed down the steps she paused and eyed Lawe keenly . " And it was ? ? " asked Lawe excitedly . " It was ? " " Ah , there you have me , Mr. Lawe , " answered the woman reluctantly . " It 's sorry I am , to be sure , for I ca n't tell you ! " " Ca n't tell me ! " The words were rife with suspicion . " No , sir , I ca n't tell you . For I could n't read it meself . I 'd forgotten me specs ! " Such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forgotten your spectacles ! " echoed Lawe almost unbelievingly.  | " Yes , Mr. Lawe . That 's right . And I 'm as blind as a bat to read without them . Yet I ca n't see two feet in front of me with them . So I 'd took them off to watch for the carrier . And I could n't read the address . Well , I 'd no mind to go back for them , since the man was already in sight . And there you are . Or rather , there you are n't ? You 'll never know the address on that letter , unless you find Martie Green ! " There was no doubting the evident sincerity of the woman 's words . Lawe sat down , with a sudden giving of the muscles all over his body . It had been such a near thing . Just touch and go . Mrs. O'Brien noted his expression . " Ah , I know it 's a bitter disappointment to you , sir , if so be it the address could have helped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , as the good Lord sees me . And I know no more than that ! " Geoffrey Lawe drew a long breath . He was satisfied at last that the woman was telling the truth  --  but how close it had been . Just a little matter of forgetting a pair of spectacles ! " Never mind , Mrs. O'Brien , " he said more coolly . " As you say you could not have known that the matter would prove to be important . And , indeed , it may not be . But Mr. Strangely had a feeling that the matter should be looked into . And now , it seems that he was right , in a way . For there were two letters instead of one . And Martie Green wrote one of them . It is a possibility , of course though probably a remote one  --  that this girl may have known something about Miss Ravenelle 's intentions . " " Martie ? Martie know ? " faltered Mrs. O'Brien , suddenly paling . " Well , it might be . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my attitude towards you , Mrs. O'Brien , " he ended charmingly , " I apologize . You see , both Inspector MacDonald and I felt that you were holding something back . But this explanation completely exonerates you . " The woman , however , did not regain her color at this reassurance .  | " You say the Inspector was after believin ' I was holding someng hack ? " " So he said . But what you 've just told me clears that up . " " ' That 's good , sir , " she replied colorlessly . " Rut this girl , Martie , now , " Lawe added rather sharply , suddenly struck by another idea . " You do n't happen to know where shr intended to go when she left your house ? " " ' That I do n't , Mr. Lawe , " said the old woman emphatically , and care less . I 'm not fearing that one will ever come to grief . The devil looks after his own ! " " There are certainly a good many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his excitement had passed , be was again looking rather pale and haggard , and was eager to be gone . The interview had left him with an unpleasant , letdown feeling . " You 're right , sir , " said Mrs. O'Brien in a low tone . " There 's many of his descendants alive . And there 's one  --  dead ! " As she spoke she crossed herself . Lawe started visibly . " What do you mean , woman , " he questioned sharply , quickly alert once more . " Why do you say that ? " Mrs. O'Brien paused doubtfully , pleating her crisp white apron into neat folds . " I never thought to speak ill of the dead , " she explained hesitatingly at last . " But I mean  --  Ralph Cumberland , Mr. Lawe ! Yes , him ! Bad clear through , he was , I 'm thinking . And now , with what you 've said of that letter and all , it brings to mind somewhat that I 'd not spoken on before , nor considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might mean a lot ! " I lis desire to go completely forgotten , Lawe sat eagerly forward in his chair . " Tell me about it , Mrs. O'Brien , " his tone brooked no refusal . " Well , sir , I 'll just say this . " Her voice trembled . " When I we him blarneying old Ravenelle , and jesting about with Miss Rilla above stairs like a sweet , loving young cousin  --  and pryin ' about sly-like below stairs , and whisperin ' with Martie Green  | behind doors  --  well , I will say it galled me unspeakable . For I had an idea , Mr. Lawe , that there was far more to it than just whispers  --  between him and the girl , I mean . That 's why I packed her off , Mr. Lawe . I 'll not have goings on of that kind near me ! " Lawe studied the woman closely . There was something nervous in the way she was running on , her voluble explanations concerning this and that . " Mebbe I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing . " But thinks I , after all he 's dead . No one can change that now . It 's over and done . And how could it matter  --  his actions with Martie Green ? What could that have to do with it ? " But now , I don ' know . Here you come , makin ' such a fuss over what she 'd wrote to someone , and thinkin ' I 'd held information back like . Well , mebbe I did hold back that much  --  the reason I 'd sent her flyin ' and all . But now I somehow got to feelin ' I 'd best speak of it to you , how things was ' twixt him and Martie . It might mean a lot . " It might mean a lot ! That was twice she had said that now , mused Lawe rather irritably . What on earth was the woman driving at ? And why had she chosen this time to speak ? Her explanation had certainly been glib enough . But why had it been forthcoming only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for the dead . But possibly , also , because of MacDonald 's suspicion that she knew far more than she had told . That idea seemed to have upset her more than one would have anticipated . And what on earth could it be that she was trying to convey in this muddled fashion ? Lawe puzzled for a moment . Could it possibly be that she thought " You think  --  you wonder whether Martie  --  no , you had best put it into your own words . Just what are you trying to say , Mrs. O'Brien ? " " That 's not for me to tell you , Mr. Lawe , " said the woman desperately . " That 's for the police to find out . But right now ? after what you 'd said and all  --  I wo n't deny I had some suspicions of my own . What they are , Mr. Lawe , I 'm not saying . But this  | I will say . Martie , for all she kept them so fine , was powerful strung in her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes narrowed to pin-points . This particular point of view had never occurred to him before . So Martie Green had been " powerful strong in the hands . " And Ralph Cumberland had died of strangulation ? What would Mat Donald make of that ? 1 Ic rose to his feet . " ' Thank you , " he said queerly . " You did quite right to tell me . It opens up some rather odd ideas that I might be able to use . A desperate woman , as the whole history of criminal law shows , will take desperate measures . This Martie , " he added in a harsh voice , " of course , she knew that Cumberland was fond of Rilla ? " " I do n't doubt she knew it well , " replied the woman shrewdly . " And a girl like her would be proper jealous of her lover , I 'm thinking ! " As Geoffrey hurried to Inspector MacDonald 's office his brain was seething with wild thoughts . A whole new theory to suggest to MacDonald opened out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the known facts ? And , over and above all , interesting as the theory had proved to be , he could not rid himself of the feeling that it was developed on the spur of the moment , with the nervous intention of keeping him away from some other subject . On the whole , he was most unsatisfied with the interview . Ile reviewed it promptly to MacDonald upon his arrival at the hatter 's office . " And you say the old lady advanced this information to you be/ore or after you 'd told her I still thought she was holding something back ? " " Afterwards , " said Lawe . " And she gave you all that talk about discharging the girl , too , after you told her that ? " " Yes . What do you think about it ? " " I think , " said MacDonald slowly , " that she lied . I think she had some other reason entirely for getting rid of the girl , and that she 's afraid we 'll find it out . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Martie was mixed up in Cumberland 's murder . But I think it was mostly bluff . " " But what are you going to do about it ? " asked Lawe . " I 'm going to find Martie Green ! " said MacDonald . But there was no chance to say more . There was a knock at the door , and the janitor , who was making his Sunday rounds , stuck in his head . " A mon to see ye , sir , " he informed MacDonald . " I towit him ye 'd no be seein ' him on the Sabbath unless it was verra important . And he tellit me it was . " " To see me ? " questioned the Inspector . " Did he give his name ? " " He said ye wouldna know his name , sir , " returned the other , " but to say he 'd coom in connection with the Ravenelle case ! " " Very well , " said MacDonald gruffly . " Bring him in . " But the man hesitated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you alone . " MacDonald stirred impatiently . " It 's extraordinary , " he said to Lawe , " how often people insist on that  --  wo n't open their heads unless they 've got you alone . And then , likely enough , the story is just a lot of twaddle that does n't mean a thing . But we 've got to go through with it all lest something slip by us . You see how it is , Mr. Lawe ? I daresay this is nothing important , but would you mind stepping into the next room ? We can talk these new developments over later . " " If you do n't mind , " returned Lawe , " I 'll just run along . I 've told you all I wanted , and I 've a mind to stop at Strangely 's rooms again . He may have returned . " " I 'm afraid not , " answered the Inspector slowly . " Our men were there only a short time ago . As a matter of fact , they made another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely no trace of the severed finger or the stained towel , and no sign at all of Mr. Strangely himself . He may have had a concealed hiding place for important things , but I do n't see how even that could escape my men . Run along , though , if you care to , Mr. Lawe . We must n't lose hope of his return , of course . He  | ht show up at any minute , and have something very vital to us . I 'll telephone you later on . Just show Mr. Lawe out the door , Alexander . " he added to the janitor , who was still wait " and then bring your man in. "  | X MR . PARKER PRATTLES THE man who entered was slight , stooped , elderly , and plainly of the clerk type . He stood diffidently in the middle of the room , twiddling his bowler hat in nervous fingers until the Inspector motioned him to a seat . At a sign from the latter , he cleared his throat diffidently , and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say will throw any light on the case , " he said awkwardly , " but I thought perhaps I 'd better tell you my story and let you make what you can of it . " My name is Andrew Parker , and I am employed by Lame &; Son  --  in fact , I worked in the same office with Miss Ravenelle . " Then , as MacDonald looked up , his attention caught , " A file clerk , I am . It was just last Monday  --  the day the young lady disappeared  --  to be exact  --  when this happened . I did n't think anything about it at the time , but afterwards I got to wondering , could it be important ? " " Yes , yes , " interrupted MacDonald , eager to get to the point , " Please get on , Mr. Parker . " " Well , ' t was just before closing time , and , being thirsty , I went out into the hallway to get a drink of water at the tap . Now , our offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of a long , dark hallway . It 's dark because , at the end where the window ought to be , they 've put across a partition and made a sort of cloak-room for the lady employees . The tap is right at the ! end of the hall , in front of this partition . I was going to turn the water on when I heard voices coming from the other side . The boards are thin , and , though the people was whispering , their voices carried . I could n't help but hear  --  at least a word or two . "  | " And those words struck you as strange , Mr. Parker ? " " Well , no , sir , in a manner of speaking , " admitted Mr. Parker . " ' That is , not at first , they did n't . I should n't have thought it was odd or listened at all ( and perhaps you think I should n't of ) , but that I could tell that one voice belonged to a man  --  and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak-room . I was curious . " " I see . Go on . " " When the lady spoke , it was in whispers , too . But , as I say , 1 was curious to know who had broke the rules . So I put my eye to a crack in the partition , and peeped in . At first all I could see was a dark shape , direct in front of the crack . But a second later moved . And the light fell straight on the lady 's face . It was iss Ravenellel " The Inspector 's face tensed . After all , this might not be the worthless story he had anticipated . " And then ? " he questioned . " I was surprised , " replied Mr. Parker . " I 'd always thought her such a fine , high-minded young lady , not given to carryings on like some others I could mention . So I wondered what could have brought her there with a man . Then , first thing I knew , she was speaking again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " commanded MacDonald , writing on his ever-present little pad of paper . " She was whispering real soft like , " answered the little man . " ' No , ' she said , all that is over : Just this once , Rilla , ' said the man real low , and then his voice got very soft , and I could only catch a word now and then . Not ask you ' I heard , and nothing wrong ' . Then she laughed real quiet and contemptuous . ' Nothing wrong ! ' she said . No  --  nothing wrong , where money is concerned . As for you ? ' and then there was some more I could n't hear . Then he said , real quick , I implore you not to believe that . ' Then they talked so low I could n't hear , until she said , That is my father 's affair  --  shall tell Ralph That was all I could get before I heard them coming , and maybe that 's not quite straight , but it 's near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( it was very dark there , you remember ) till Miss Ravenelle come out and passed me . Then I waited some more , but the man did n't come out . So , after a bit , I tiptoed to the door and glanced in . The cloak-room was empty . But I seen what I never noticed before , for I 'd never been in after they made the place into a lady 's room . They had cut another door and a narrow flight of steps , leading down to the floor below , so that the employees on that floor could use the room , too . He must of gone that way . " " So you did n't see who he was ? " " No , sir , I did n't . " " Nor recognize his voice ? " " No , sir . They was speaking entirely in whispers . " " Had you any idea who it could be ? " " No , sir , I had n't . That is to say , not definite . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs in the advertising rooms , along of what happened later . " " Oh  --  something more happened , then ! " MacDonald took up his pencil . " Yes , sir , " replied the man deprecatingly . " I 'd never seen that little flight of steps before , because there 's just the advertising department on the floor below , and so no call for none of us to go down there . Well , when I went back to my desk , I did n't see Miss Ravenelle right away , for the boys told me Mr. Lawe 's secretary had been ringing for the files . So I hurried right up to his private room  --  old Mr. Lawe , I mean . But when I come back , I noticed Miss Ravenelle pick up her handbag and get ready to go home . She opened her bag and pulled out her handkerchief . That was just as I passed her desk . And , when she pulled it out , a sheet of paper fell to the floor . " " You picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that , Mr. MacDonald . Though I thought nothing of it till I see she had grown white and was trembling like a leaf . She grabs the paper from me without a word of thanks . It was n't like her  --  such a pleasant , cheerful young lady  --  but , thinks  | I , she 's just nervous after that scene in the cloak-room . She turned away and stuck the paper back in her bag . " " And what was on this paper ? " inquired MacDonald , not attempting to disguise his eagerness . Here , perhaps , was the explanation of what Strangely had suspected when Lawe told him that Rilla Ravenelle was carrying something home at night in her handbag ! " What was it ? " he asked again emphatically . " What was it that frightened her so badly ? " " ' That 's the funny part of it , sir , " replied the little man . " As far as I could see , there was nothing on it to frighten her at all . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd fact with a puzzled frown on his face . " Then you think her agitation was not caused , after all , by dropping the paper , but that it arose from her recent conversation In the cloak-room with the unknown man ? Is that it , Mr. Parker ? " " I suppose so , sir . " " But , on the other hand , you think she might have been given that picture just a few minutes before , by the same man , in the cloak-room ? " " I do n't know , sir . I just thought it was possible . A couple of the gentlemen in the advertising department are artists . " " And you thought that dropping the picture on the floor reminded her of her recent interview , and caused her to tremble ? " " It might of done , sir . As I say , I did n't think much of it then . But , afterwards , when Miss Ravenelle disappeared , I began to wonder . " " Would you know that picture if you saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . There was a lot of little flowers on it  --  red ones . " MacDonald suddenly pulled briskly at his gray mustache , as was his habit when anything intrigued him . " And those flowers , Mr. Parker ? They were roses , perhaps ? Or lilies ? What were they ? "  | The little man scratched his ear reflectively . " Well , now , " he said , " they was n't any of those . They was in the background  --  growing . And they looked more like , wellwall-flowers of some sort ! " " Ah  --  yes , " said MacDonald reflectively . " Wall-flowers ! " He thought a moment . " Mr. Parker , can you tell me anything about the personnel of the advertising department ? " " It 's a smallish affair , sir , " answered Parker . " Not many employees . And there 's just two of them as far as I know that makes the dee-signs . A Mr. Pendleton and a Mr. DuFaur . But I do n't say they 'd anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of idea of mine  --  account of the picture . " " I know , I know , " MacDonald nodded curtly , " but we 'll look into it . Thank you for your information , Mr. Parker . As you say , it may not mean much . But again , we may find it most important . What I do n't understand is why you did n't come to me sooner , or at least tell Mr. Lawe about all this ! " Parker looked confused . " You know how it is , sir , " he said huskily . " I 'd been eavesdropping , so to speak . It ai n't a nice thing to do , and if I 'd told , it might have give the impression that I 'm not exactly trustworthy ? a Paul Pry , nebbing into other people 's business all the time . I thought of telling , sir . But I hated to do it . At last I told my wife , and she advised me to see you , private . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis . " I 'll just take your address , Mr. Parker . And you 're quite willing to swear to this story , should the need arise ? " The man hesitated . Finally , he spoke . " Yes , sir . If it comes to that , I suppose I am . Though I 've been with the firm for fifteen years , sir , and I 'd hate to be the one to mix them up in any scandal . " " You may spare your feelings , Mr. Parker , " replied the Inspector kindly . " The firm was brought into  --  well  --  if not a scandal , at least a mystery , when poor little Miss Ravenelle disappeared . As far as that goes , young Mr. Lawe would be the first to corn-  | mend you for telling what you know . And I 'm sure he would agree with me that you should have told sooner . He has been leaving no stone unturned to find Miss Ravenelle , and if anyone on his employ is involved in her disappearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're sure the body on the embankment is that of the young lady , sir ? " asked Parker diffidently , and his rather faded blue eyes filled with easy tears as MacDonald nodded in the aff rrnative . " We ca n't think anything else , Mr. Parker . The autopsy was conclusive . " " She was a nice , kind young lady , Mr. MacDonald  --  it 's an awful fate she met . And you think Mr. Lawe will think I did fight to tell what I know ? " " Unquestionably . " Parker 's face brightened . " That eases my mind , sir , " he said . " Though I 'm not so sure what the old gentleman would think , if he knew . But I 'll not worry , Mr. MacDonald , for I think I 've done right . Well , it 's sad world , sir , and if the young lady is out of it so soon , mayhap it 's saved her something worse . Good night , Mr. MacDonald . ( ; ood night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time after the little man had left , the Inspector sat sunk in reverie . The maze surrounding this problem seemed to become more and more intricate . Never before had he had a case , seemingly so simple and yet so involved . There seemed to be no lack of clues , and yet not one which really led anywhere . The apparently simple disappearance of an obscure little typist had led further and further , until it would end  --  where ? In his mind , MacDonald ran over the list of people either directly or indirectly concerned with the girl : I. Basil Ravenelle , her crippled father . 2 . Geoffrey Lawe , in love with the girl . 3 . Ralph Cumberland , her murdered cousin . 4 . Martie Green , the discharged domestic . 5 . Mrs. O'Brien , her landlady . 6 . The mysterious owner of the yacht Wall-Flower. 7 . The no less mysterious Someone who had , according to Mr. Parker 's recent tale , talked in the cloak-room with Rilla Ravenelle on the day of her disappearance . 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . American amateur detective  --  possible victim or possible criminal  --  vanished as if from the face of the earth ! During the last two hours , additional evidence had come into MacDonald 's hands from two different sources  --  Mrs. O'Brien and Mr. Parker . If true , one item at least of this evidence provided a powerful motive for a double crime . This was the evidence concerning the intimacy of Ralph Cumberland 4nd Martie Green .  | But Inspector MacDonald was not at all sure that it was true . Yet what motive could Mrs. O'Brien have for lying ? When MacDonald had first entered the case , he had suspected Cumberland at once of engineering the disappearance of the missing girl , Rilla Ravenelle . Later , when the body of a young girl , dead by strangulation , had been found upon the embankment , he had been convinced that the remains were those of Rilla Ravendie , and that Ralph Cumberland was her murderer . But , as if to preclude at least a part of this theory , Cumberland himself had been murdered  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDonald 's neat ideas . He had been for some time decidedly at a loss . But here was information which , if true , promised to bring a ray of light . It seemed not at all impossible , if Mrs. O'Brien 's words were true , that Martie Green , in a fit of rage and jealousy ( caused by the admiration of Cumberland for his beautiful cousin , Rilla ) had killed first the object of this jealousy , and later had murdered Cumberland himself . So far , all ran smoothly . But at this point MacDonald struck a snag . How , under these circumstances , could one account for the presence of the severed finger in Cumberland 's room ? If the man had not killed Rilla Ravenelle , severed her finger from her hand in order to obtain some ring , and then hidden the finger beneath the step in his bed-room  --  well , how had it got there ? Had Martie Green murdered Rilla , and concealed the finger in Cumberland 's room ? It was not at all possible that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why should she do that if her object was not to cast suspicion on her lover , but to murder him ? In such a case , why go to all that trouble ? Yet even if Cumberland himself had killed his cousin , why on earth had he hidden the finger in his own room instead of getting rid of it in the river or somewhere ? Sentiment ? Could n't bear to destroy his sweetheart 's finger ? Bosh ! He had destroyed her , had n't he ? Perhaps he did n't know it was there ? That led back , of course ,  | to the supposition of someone planting it there ? And who could that someone be except Martie Green ? Only  --  why ? Oh , hell ! MacDonald rubbed his head wearily . He was getting nowhere . Accordingly , he swung back to his first theory  --  i.e. , Cumberland had murdered his cousin , Rilla Ravenelle , in a fit of jealous rage because he thought that she preferred her wealthy young employer , Geoffrey Lawe , to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Martie Green , his clandestine sweetheart . If these facts were so , then retribution had followed quickly upon the heels of crime . But MacDonald did not believe that they were true . Things simply did n't fit in . For one thing , the similarity in method of the two killings  --  strangulation in both cases  --  pointed to the same murderer each time . And , again , if Cumberland had killed Rilla Ravenelle himself , why had he definitely implicated himself in the crime by concealing the severed finger in his own room ? MacDonald sighed heavily . The case was like a treadmill . One went on and on , and never got anywhere . Just came back to the same place . One thing , however , was indisputable . Rilla Ravenelle and Ralph Cumberland , dead , could not help him . But Martie Green , living , could ! Therefore , find Martie Green ! Somewhere in the city of London , or outside of it , Martie Green was living . And , through her , he might be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherchez la femme ! " Those French chaps are certainly right . Sooner or later we come to it . Hunt the woman ! " On sudden impulse , MacDonald glanced at his watch , and then turned to the telephone . " I hope I 'm not disturbing you , Mr. Lawe , " he said when his party had answered . " But can you meet me at your own offices in the city at , say , seven-thirty this evening ? That will give me  | time to get a cold snack first . We can be undisturbed down there to-night , of course , and there 's a bit of investigating I 'd like to do . All right ? Fine ! " Next he sent for one of the most capable men who had been working on the case with him  --  a young chap by the name of Francis Kelly . " Kelly , " he said , " I want you to trace a certain Martie Green , recently discharged from 19 Acacia Villas . As I understand it , Mrs. O'Brien , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting her servants from the Elite Employment Agency , Euston Road . And if this Martie Green was registered with them once , she would probably be so again . You might also make a few inquiries in the neighborhood of Acacia Villas . Get her description  --  I hate to make you take your Sunday for this , but " I have her description , sir , " said Kelly impassively , noting not without satisfaction the look of astonishment on his chief 's face . " Well , Kelly , " answered MacDonald with a tug at his mustache , " I 've never denied that you are a swift worker . But I believe that 's the first time you 've anticipated my orders so neatly . What was it  --  telepathy ? " " No , sir . Nothing so complicated as all that . Only , as soon as Mrs. O'Brien spoke , at the inquest , of discharging a maid , I decided I 'd find out what I could about the girl . You see she might of had something to do with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite or something . Or else Mrs. O'Brien might of wanted to get her out of the way because she knew too much about something . Anyhow I looked her up . I could n't find out where she 'd gone , but I did find out what she looked like . " He pulled out a piece of paper and pushed it across the table . " Rather below than above medium height , slender but wellrounded , graceful , dark hair , dark eyes , very pretty in a flashy way , high color and good teeth . ' I 'm anxious to get on her track . " " Good lad ! " said MacDonald curtly . " And look sharp about it , for I believe it 's going to be important . Your having this data all ready saves time for us . Any word yet of Peter Strangely ? " " No , sir , none . He seems to have vanished completely , after  | he left his laboratory on the evening of July aoth , around ten o'clock . I talked again with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also with the maid Dora . But both of them still swear that they did n't hear Mr. Strangely return to the house after renting Cumberland 's room that night . They was most positive about it . But , sir , it seems to me ? " he paused and shuffled his feet uneasily . " Well ? " " I think , sir , that the maid , Dora , knows something that she wo n't tell ! " " What makes you think that , Kelly ? " MacDonald had respect for this awkward , red-headed young man 's ideas , and did not conceal the fact from his subordinate . Neither did he take the credit for any important discoveries which the latter happened to unearth . All of which Kelly realized , and accordingly worked the harder for MacDonald , whom he admired exceedingly . Now he looked up with a frown on his frank , freckled young face . " She 's got a shut-down look , Mr. MacDonald , like she was guarding against letting out too much . I 've noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Besides , sir " Well ? " " It does seem peculiar that a man the size of Mr. Cumberland could be strangled to death within arm 's reach , so to speak , of other people , and them not hear a noise of some kind ! Yet no one was disturbed at all  --  or so they say . That 's what they swear , sir , just as they did at the inquest . No noise . No struggle . No nothing . It 's my opinion something 's being held back . Then there 's this  --  if Cumberland had given up his room and handed in his keys , how did he get back in ? Why , it stands to reason that he must of got in with someone who did have a key ! And that someone might well of been Mr. Strangely ! " MacDonald frowned thoughtfully . " Yes , I 'd thought of that . But Strangely did n't know Cumberland . Had never even seen him . He would n't be apt to let a stranger into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger said he was a lodger there ? " " Not even then . For Strangely would think that if the man ere a lodger , he 'd have a key  --  would be suspicious of him if he , ad n't , and tell him to ring . " " Maybe so , sir . But he might of met him somewhere and -. me back with him . " " That 's scarcely likely , Kelly . In the comparatively short space . f time that must have elapsed between Cumberland 's leaving he house and his subsequent return , how could he have met Strangely and the two of them become sufficiently friendly to return together ? Remember , Strangely was with Geoffrey Lame until nearly ten o'clock . " " I do n't know anything about becoming friendly , sir , " said Kelly slowly . " But , to my mind , there was enough time for Mr. Strangely to stumble on Cumberland somewheres in the city , and . follow him back to Mrs. Lugg 's . " " That 's hardly likely , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find him again ! " replied MacDonald drily . " But go on . " " And , as for entering the house together , " continued Kelly impressively , " well  --  maybe they did . But not both afoot ! " MacDonald stared . " What are you driving at , Kelly . Speak up . What have you got in that red head of yours now ? " " Just this , Mr. MacDonald . You know yourself , it 's very strange a man of Cumberland 's build could be put out of business , surrounded by people on all sides , and no one hear anything , at all , at all ! " " You 've said that before . I confess I do n't consider it so odd , myself . The man had been drinking heavily . We have that evidence from our own men who followed him from pub to pub , before they lost track of him . You yourself , with Beauprey , followed him for over an hour . Heaven knows how much he drank that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old rooming house through force of habit . Somehow he got in . And , when he reached his room , he sank  | on the bed in a drunken stupor , thus making easy work for the murderer . In that case , there would be no particular noise or commotion . " " It may be as you say , sir , " persisted Kelly doggedly , " but I 've got my theory , too . I think , " he paused , emphasizing each word when he spoke again , " I think that , drunk or not drunk , Cumberland was killed before ever he entered Mrs. Lugg 's house . I think Peter Strangely carried him in ! "  | XII A SEA OF SUSPICIONS FoR two hours MacDonald and Lawe had discussed the case , sitting together in Lawe 's private office . Although Lawe 's eyes were deeply sunk in his head with fatigue , and he had scarcely eaten for the past few days , nevertheless he threw himself into the discussion with a reserve force that the detective could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affair , from the start  --  the disappearance of Rilla Ravenelle on the evening of Monday , July 17 . Then followed the investigations by Lawe and Peter Strangely on the night of July zoth , which culminated in the finding of the mutilated finger in Ralph Cumberland 's room ; Strangely 's idea that the yacht Wall-Flower was connected in some way with the Ravenelles ; the murder of Ralph Cumberland ; Peter Strangely 's disappearance ; the discovery of a woman 's unrecognizable body on the embankment ; the inquests , and the conclusive evidence offered that this body was that of Rilla Ravenelle ; the investigation of the letter mailed by Mrs. O'Brien , which had led indirectly to the discovery that Ralph Cumberland and Martie Green , the discharged maid , had been on terms of intimacy ; and , last of all , the man Parker 's evidence concerning the cloak-room scene , when he had overheard the words of Rilla Ravenelle and some unidentified man . This brought them up to the present and to Sergeant Kelly 's theory that Cumberland had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carried in by Peter Strangely . " And Kelly thinks that Strangely actually killed Cumberland ? " questioned Lawe wonderingly .  | " Yes , Kelly thinks so  --  indubitably , " replied the Inspector , leaning back in Lawe 's swivel chair , his thumbs thrust into his vest pockets . " I do n't . As a matter of fact , I rather lean to the theory that Martie Green , Cumberland 's secret sweetheart , killed both Rilla Ravenelle and Cumberland . That , however , would not preclude Strangely from carrying the body of Cumberland back to his room in the lodging house . " " But why should he ? " asked Lawe , running a perplexed hand through his untidy blond hair . " Ah , there you 're asking something , " sighed MacDonald . " This whole affair is nothing but why 's ' . I no sooner have a pretty solution than some new WHY comes up and spoils it all . " Lawe 's lips were twitching nervously , but it was the only sign he showed of inward perturbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps you 'll think I 'm crazy to keep on holding out hope to myself about Rilla Ravenelle , in the face of the conclusive evidence produced at the inquest that the body on the embankment must be hers . But I have never believed it . Somehow , in spite of everything , I can not think that it is ! " MacDonald slowly withdrew his thumbs from his vest pockets , and regarded the young man as if he were , indeed , considering the matter of his sanity . Lawe rushed on . " There was too close a bond between us . I feel that if she really were dead , I would know it . I have never felt that body to be hers . Somewhere Rilla Ravenelle is alive and waiting for us to find her . And I ca n't  --  I ca n't " his voice sank to a whisper ? " all this waiting  --  you do n't know  --  it 's terrible . Sometimes I think I shall go mad ! " MacDonald regarded the young man with a gleam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective feeling in more rugged characters . " I wish I could feel the same way about the young lady being alive , " said the Inspector in a gentle tone which his underlings would have failed to recognize . " But we ca n't get around that  | evidence the autopsy brought out  --  about the pineapple and mushrooms in the victim 's stomach . And , even without that , all the facts point the other way . Just look at them , Mr. Lawe . " He tapped his writing pad for emphasis as he continued . " The young lady disappears . Our men make a systematized search all over London , with no result . Four days later a headless , handless body  --  evidently several days dead  --  is picked up piecemeal on the embankment . The victim is of the same build and apparently the same age as Rilla Ravenelle . The autopsy shows traces of the very food which Mrs. O'Brien asserts the missing girl ate on the evening of her disappearance . No other girl is reported missing at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify it . In the meantime , a woman 's finger has been found in the room of Rilla Ravenelle 's cousin , Ralph Cumberland . Now , all that is too strange to be mere coincidence . There must be some connection . Then , on top of everything else , Cumberland himself is murdered . The known facts , at the present moment , all point toward the supposition that the same person killed both Cumberland and the girl . Who more likely , then , than Martie Green , whom Mrs. O'Brien swears to have been in love with Cumberland , while he was infatuated with his cousin , Rilla Ravenelle ? We have a pretty little triangle there . And , to add fuel to the blaze , Mrs. O'Brien tells us that Martie was very strong in the hands . As we know , both Rilla Ravenelle and Cumberland were victims of strangulation . Do n't you see how the whole thing links up ? The girl on the embankment could not be anyone except Miss Ravenelle ! " The only hitch is the finger found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have to figure that out somehow , " he went on . " So I do n't see , Mr. Lawe , how in the face of all these facts , you can still cling to the fact that Rilla Ravenelle still lives ! " " Perhaps not , " admitted Lawe through clenched teeth . " Perhaps not  --  now . We have delayed so long in finding her . But that body is not hers ! " MacDonald put his hand on the younger man 's shoulder . " Mr. Lawe , " he advised kindly , " do n't let this thing get the  | better of you . The shock has been great . You 're unhinged from it all , and you ca n't make up your mind to give in . You had better face it , once and for all . The murdered girl and Rilla Ravenelle are one and the same ! " Lawe bowed his head , but did not reply . " About this man , Parker , now , " began the Inspector briskly after a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , " replied Lawe , forcing himself to a matter-of-fact tone , " I was going to ask you what you make of his wild story ? overhearing that conversation , picking up a picture , and so on . Do you believe it ? " " I do n't see why not , Mr. Lawe . The old man seemed absolutely sure of himself . What do you think ? " " I scarcely know what to think , " said Geoffrey uncertainly . " It seems to me that a fraction of it might be true , but the rest sounds like pure fabrication . " He looked up suddenly . " Miss Ravenelle was not the type of girl to go whispering about in cloak-rooms with men . " MacDonald wisely refrained from remarking that thirty years of detective experience had proved to him that no woman , young or old , is a known quantity to any man . He merely took refuge , as usual , in facts . " Parker repeated the conversation to me , " he said . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you noticed there was nothing very definite in what he said to you ? nothing that he could n't easily have invented from reading of the case in the newspapers ? You know there is n't a sensational case in the whole country that someone or other does n't step into the limelight with false information . " " Oh , yes , I know that , " replied MacDonald , eyeing the speaker meditatively . " You 're quite right there . It seems , to some warped minds , the only chance to get a bit of attention for themselves  --  to feel their own importance . " " That 's just it , " said Lawe , leaning forward eagerly . " Now , old Parker has been with us ever since I was a boy , and I never  | heard him have anything much to say for himself before this . But he 's a queer , crack-brained old duck . It seems a very unlikely tale to me  --  the cloak-room and all that . Far too mysterious to be true . As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fond of good pictures . She may even have dropped one , and Parker may have picked it up . As for her agitation being caused by such a simple incident , that 's ridiculous . You know yourself , Mr. MacDonald , two of the other office girls testified that Rilla had been upset all day . " " Yes , I remember , " said his companion slowly , as if weighing the words . " But there is just one thing which seems to preclude that  --  something which makes me believe that old Parker was telling the truth ! " " What 's that ? " " The fact that Parker described that picture as having wallflowers in the background ! " Lawe started . " Parker said that ? Well , even so  --  it 's nothing he could n't have invented from reading about the case in the papers . " MacDonald ' smiled . " On the contrary , Mr. Lawe , there has been absolutely nothing concerning the Wall-Flower in the papers . We have been most careful to keep it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lawe slowly . " It 's certainly very odd , in that case . And there may be some truth in his statement . But I certainly place no credence in the cloak-room conversation . Do you ? " The Inspector tapped consideringly with his pencil . " I rather think I do . And there 's something else  --  you remember what the doctor 's assistant testified at the inquest ? That she had met Rilla Ravenelle in the hall of Mrs. O'Brien 's house on the Saturday afternoon before the girl 's disappearance ? That Rilla had been crying , and that she said someone she loved ' was unworthy ? " " Yes , I remember , " said Lawe . " Ralph Cumberland must have been the person she meant , of course . He was her cousin , and  | she was very fond of him in a cousinly way . No doubt she had discovered his relations with the maid , Martie Green , and was dreadfully shocked . Perhaps Martie made the disclosure , out of pique . " But MacDonald shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he pronounced at last , " that you 're taking too much for granted . Miss Ravenelle was probably fond of Cumberland  --  yes . As you say , had a cousinly affection for him . No doubt she would have been much grieved to learn of his intimacy with a girl of Martie Green 's type . But I do n't think the revelation would have shocked her to the extent that something very evidently had . Now , Lawe , " he brought his hand down impressively on the desk , " has it ever occurred to you that the trouble may have originated with someone who was much nearer to her than Cumberland  --  very much nearer . And that Miss Ravenelle had learned something about this someone else , something so shocking that it drove her out , on the night of July 17th , to confer with her cousin , Ralph Cumberland ! And that that someone might well have been  --  can you think who , Mr. Lawe ? " Lawe , eyeing the speaker intently , slowly paled , half recoiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't mean ? " " Mr. Ravenelle , himself , " said MacDonald firmly , watching to see the effect of his words on the hearer . " The girl 's own father ! " Lawe put one hand over his eyes . " I had not thought of Mr. Ravenelle , " he said , in a low voice , " as actively concerned in her disappearance . The thing is impossible . Why , the man is a cripple . He could have had nothing to do with these  --  tragedies . " " You misunderstand me , Mr. Lawe . I am not suggesting that Ravenelle murdered his daughter and did away with Cumberland . I am only revolving the possibility of his being the loved one ' of whom Rilla Ravenelle spoke . And you ca n't deny that there is something very queer about the man . Something cold and fishy , a mask impossible to penetrate . His daughter may suddenly have ! ' J  | arncd something about him , about his past , that drove her out ask Cumberland 's advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would have - 'inc to me ! " " Not necessarily . A family affair  --  she might have felt ashamed , humiliated by what she had learned . " Lawe shook his head . " I ca n't think you 're right , Mr. MacDonald . Why , her last words were Tell Father it will be all right . ' That does n't sound as if she were angry , or disillusioned about him . " " On the contrary , Mr. Lawe , it might very well bear out my theory . She may have been talking with him , reproaching him . But , upon leaving the house , her affection gets the better of her , and she sends back the reassuring words , Tell Father it will be all right . ' Mind now , I 'm not saying this theory is correct  --  I 'm ? fly saying that we 've got to make old Ravenelle talk ! " It may be , Mr. Lawe , that after all , he has had a more active part in this affair than we realize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing dangerously . " If I thought that ? " he began hoarsely . " Calm yourself , Mr. Lawe . That was merely a supposition on my part , ( I have a habit of thinking out loud , I 'm afraid ) and probably an erroneous one . Ravenelle seemed honestly overcome at his daughter 's disappearance . And as for committing the actual crime  --  he is far too helpless . " " He may not be as helpless as we think , " muttered Lawe , his suspicions now aroused . " Even so , Mr. Lawe , with his crippled limbs , it would be an impossibility for him to crawl down three long flights of stairs and reach the street , without attracting some attention . " " There are such things as accomplices , " said Lawe thickly . " Well , you may be sure the old man knows more than he will say , about his daughter 's reasons for departure , whatever he may know about her murder , " replied MacDonald , with a satisfied expression on his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we 're through with him . And now , Mr. Lawe , before we leave ,  | I 'd like to get all the information you can give me concerning your advertising department . That 's the real reason that I met you here to-night . I want to know all about the young gentlemen employed on the floor below this . Old Parker seemed to think it was one of them who might have been talking with Miss Ravenelle in the cloak-room . Because of the stairs leading from the cloak-room to the other floor . You see , he waited for some time , and no man came out , so he figured the chap had gone down the stairs . " " Oh , old Parker and his story , " replied Lawe with an impatient gesture . " Of course , he did n't see any man come out  --  because there was n't any man there . I hope you are n't suspecting those young chaps , down there , of any complicity in this miserable business . DuFaur is a Frenchman , an extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sahib . They are the only two of the staff who do any of the actual designing or painting . And both are above suspicion . Neither is the sort to go sneaking up his employers ' back stairs and carry on a clandestine meeting with some girl in the woman 's cloak-room . If you wish , however , we can go down and look about the offices . Jones , the night watchman , will be there . " " Not to-night , I think , " replied the Inspector , " but I 'll drop in sometime when they are there themselves and I can look them over . Hello ! There 's the telephone . Must be for me . I left word for Kelly to call me here if anything new turned up . " He took down the receiver , and there was a short pause while the person at the other end of the line gave some piece of information . Then came a short bark of surprise from MacDonald . " Well , Mr. Lawe , " he said soberly , laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " after all , mad as your conviction has seemed until this minute , I am forced to believe there may be something in it . It is just possible that Rilla Ravenelle may be alive ! " " What do you mean ? " queried Lawe hoarsely , through stiff lips . His face was pale as death , and his hands clenched until the knuckles showed white .  | " Because , " explained MacDonald , enjoying to the full the ramatic effect of his statement , " a ring belonging to Martie teen was found not fifty paces from the spot on the embankment here the mutilated body was discovered ! " He put out a steady ; hand as Lawe swayed on his feet . " But that might mean , " whispered the latter , " that might only can that Martie Green was the murderess  --  just as you have ought ! " " No ? , " said MacDonald . " No  --  I do n't think so . It might , f course , if it were n't for just one thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " inquired Lawe through white ps . " It 's this , " replied MacDonald firmly . " Someone had cut off that finger to get a ring ! Now , a ring turns up . And it is a ring which seems to have belonged not to Rilla Ravenelle  --  but to Martie Green ! " " I  --  had forgotten that , " said Lawe with difficulty . " Then you mean that there is a ray of hope  --  after all ? That the body may not belong to Rilla , in spite of evidence to the contrary ? That it may belong to Martie Green ? Is that what you mean ? For ! God 's sake , do n't keep me longer in suspense ! " " I do n't want you to get too hopeful , Mr. Lawe , " replied the Inspector , " but I see no harm in telling you that it was Kelly who just telephoned , and he seems to think it looks that way right now . I confess , it never occurred to me till this minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered . What a tangle , what a tangle ! " " But the relief  --  the relief of knowing " Now mind , Mr. Lawe , " said MacDonald sternly . " You do n't know ! It 's only a new angle to the case . Kelly only said it looked right now as if the body might be that of either girl , but he leaned slightly to the theory of its being Martie Green on account of the severed finger and the ring . It fits in so well . And he brought to mind the fact that Martie might well have eaten pineapple and mushrooms on the night of July 17th , for Mrs. O'Brien said everyone in the house had the same thing , and this girl did n't  | leave the place until after supper . So the autopsy need not have been as conclusive as we thought . " " But now that there 's a chance , you wo n't give up ? You 'll go on hunting for Rilla ? Just tell me that . That 's all I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will , " said MacDonald soothingly . " We 'll not leave a stone unturned to unravel the mystery . And I must say , Mr. Lawe , the case is taking on a stranger aspect all the time . What an affair ! " He rubbed his hands together in a rather gratified way . " It 's not often we get into anything like this . Whose was the body on the embankment  --  Rilla Ravenelle 's or Martie Green 's ? Oh , a very pretty question ! " Both men were silent for a few moments , and then MacDonald heaved a tired sigh . " It 's been a long day , " he said wearily . " I 'll be moving on now . But will you meet me at my office the first thing in the morning , Mr. Lawe ? Can you get away ? " " Yes , " replied Lawe tersely . " I 'll see you at nine . " When he reached home half an hour later , he found a note from Baron 's Court . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Lawe 's instructions  --  to Simmons , the valet . The message was very short , and it had come by hand . " Can you call , Mr. Simmons ? " it ran . " I have remembered the name ! "  | XIII DEATH STALKS AGAIN THE clock was just striking nine when Geoffrey Lawe knocked at the door of Inspector MacDonald 's office , at Scotland Yard , the following morning . The Inspector was pleased to observe that his visitor looked more rested and at ease than he had for some days past . " Well , Mr. MacDonald , " was the young man 's cheerful greeting , " I 'm hoping we shall get a good bit farther this morning . To begin with , when I reached home last night , I found a note from Watkins , the postman , asking me to drop around this morning  --  that he had remembered the address on the second letter that Mrs. O'Brien gave him to mail . " MacDonald looked mystified . " The second letter ? What do you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he repeated . Then he gave his knee a resounding slap . " By Jove , in the face of all those other developments yesterday  --  Mrs. O'Brien 's suspicions about Cumberland , and Martie Green , and so on , I completely forgot to tell you about the letter . As a matter of fact , there 's no harm done , as the chap could n't remember the address on it until now , anyhow . Yes , he told me that Mrs. O'Brien had given him two letters to mail  --  not one . So I went directly to her yesterday morning and asked her about it . And she had just told me , when she went on to expatiate on the Cumberland-Green business . And , in the excitement of thinking I 'd stumbled on a new solution of the murders , I forgot all about the deuced letter . You see , according to Watkins , Mrs. O'Brien mailed not one letter that  | night , but two . And , according to Mrs. O'Brien , the first letter was one she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified . But the second one was given to her to mail by ? Martie Green ! " " By Martie Green ! " MacDonald sat bolt upright . " Yes . She said the girl was busy packing her bag , and asked her to mail the letter . " The Inspector riveted frowning eyes upon the other man . " Indeed , Mr. Lawe , you should not have forgotten to tell me that . Why , that 's most important . More important , I 'd say , than what we learned about Cumberland and the girl . For the person who received that letter knows a lot about Martie Green , no doubt , that we 'd like to know ourselves . May even know what she intended to do after leaving Mrs. O'Brien 's service . May even have had something to do with her murder  --  if that really is Martie Green 's body that we found . Why , Mr. Lawe , how you ever came to ? " Lawe held up his hand . " Just a minute , Mr. MacDonald . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten if I 'd been able to find out anything more . Do n't think I did n't attach importance to the point ! I realized just what it could mean  --  although Kelly had not yet found the ring , and you had no idea yet that the girl might be dead . Just listen to my story . The first time I went to see John Watkins , as you know , I was unable to interview him on account of his illness . Yesterday morning I went again . This time I was able to see the man . He gave me the surprising information about the existence of a second letter , but he was unable to remember the address . He had noted it , at the time , he says , but had forgotten it . " " Forgotten it ! " " Yes . But the wonder is not that he forgot it . It 's more curious that he read it , at all ! At any rate , he said the name on this letter had impressed him at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I left my address and told him to communicate with me directly he remembered  --  not to write the  | me , as one ca n't be too careful , but to drop me a line saying he d remembered . Last night this note arrived . Simmons said tame by messenger . " l.awe handed the letter to the Inspector , who read it carefully cr and over . " But it is addressed to a Mr. Simmons , " he ejaculated at last in ? prise . Lawe smiled . " My valet , if you remember , " he said . " He 's been in the family ? r years . I thought it a bit safer to employ his name instead of y own , as our firm has figured rather prominently in the case Miss Ravenelle , and I was afraid of scaring the man off . Fear the law , you know , is very potent . " MacDonald pursed his lips . " Of course , in a sinister affair of this kind , every precaution is heedful . Still  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . I told him I was expecting a note from Baron 's urt , addressed in his name . So , naturally , he handed it directly to me . " " Well , well , Mr. Lawe , " said MacDonald , shaking his head . " We certainly live in a world of surprises . Who ever would have thought when Mr. Strangely advised tracing that first letter , that we would find a second ? And that second written by Martie Green , too ? Why , we did n't even know there was a Martie Green ! By the way , what did Mrs. O'Brien say about the letter ? Had she read the address ? " Lawe gave a grim little smile . " She had certainly tried to  --  in the immemorial way of mistress and maid . But luck was against her . She had forgotten her spectacles , and to quote her , she 's as ' blind as a bat without them ' ! " " And you cautioned Watkins , of course , not to speak of the matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I cautioned him not to tell even his wife , " said Lawe . " Just so . Just so , " answered MacDonald rubbing his hands in satisfaction . " Well , I 'm most anxious to learn the outcome . It  | should surely lead us somewhere . Wait till I get my hat and we 'll go over there together . " They were just leaving the room when Sergeant Kelly rushed in . His face was red with excitement , and his carroty hair stood almost upright as was its habit in moments of stress . " I was hoping I 'd catch you , sir , " he said to MacDonald . " There 's just been an emergency call over the phone . Another murder ! " " Good Lord ! " cried MacDonald . " What next ? Has all London gone mad on murders ? I 've an appointment , Kelly  --  something to do with the Ravenelle case  --  and I ca n't go . But take any two men you like , and look the ground over yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the body 's not disturbed until I can get there . What 's the address ? " " It 's out Earl 's Court way , sir . Number ro , Baron 's Court . The constable who called up says the woman 's in a state of rare excitement . He ca n't get much out of her . She " but Kelly broke off at the sight of Lawe 's face . " My God , Inspector ! " Lawe cried . " That 's John Watkins ' address ! " " What ? Not Watkins , the postman  --  the chap we were going to see ? " was the thundering reply . " Yes  --  yes . That 's Watkins ' address . ro Baron 's Court . " " Is it an apartment house ? Does more than one family live there ? " The Inspector 's tones were seething with suppressed excitement . " No , it 's just an ordinary house , a small one , like all the houses on Baron 's Court . Do you think " Time to think when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke into a run , down the hallway , calling out instructions as he went . " You  --  Kelly ! A taxi-cab . Quick ! Do n't wait to pick up any more men . Just jump in with Mr. Lawe and myself ! " " We 're up against someone who stops at nothing , " he added briefly , once they were in the cab and rolling in the direction of Hammersmith .  | " II Watkins is dead , " replied Lawe tensely , " then it means ? " " 1t means , Mr. Lawe , that we 'll never know the address on that rl Someone is suppressing the evidence . And that someone st have inside information . He must know pretty positively ry step we are taking . As far as I know , only you and I and r . Strangely have attached any importance to the fact of Mrs. ' Brien mailing a letter on the night that Rilla Ravenelle disppcared  --  and not one of us could tell that it would turn out to ve been written by Martie Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  is murdered just on the eve of telling us the Idress on that letter ! Someone has been spying  --  and spying ust effectually . " " Watkins may have spoken of it himself , in spite of all my arnings , " suggested Lawe . " And do n't forget , " contributed MacDonald significantly , " there your valet , the man Simmons ! " " Why , yes , " agreed Lawe , " but I 'd sooner suspect myself than poor old Simmons . He 's been with the family since before I was born . He was devoted to both my father and my mother , and I honestly believe he thinks the sun rises and sets on me . Very often he looks after me even yet as though I were still a child , " this last with a reluctant smile . " Just the same , I think we 'd best have a go at him , " muttered young Kelly , who had not been present when Lawe told MacDonald of the receipt of the message from John Watkins , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native sagacity . " Wait till you see him , " returned Lawe , with the nearest approach to a real grin than had been seen on his face for many ' days . " I do n't think even you Scotland Yarders could have the heart to suspect old Simmy of anything but saying his prayers . As a matter of fact , he 's getting to be an awful nuisance . Just patters about under foot . But we keep him on , anyhow . He 's been very faithful . By the way , Sergeant Kelly , I am more anxious than I can say . Have you heard anything yet of Peter Strangely ? I feel more or less responsible , in a way , since I got him into the case . " Sergeant Kelly 's expressive Irish face fell with disappointment . " Mr. Lawe , " he affirmed solemnly , " I 'm telling you the earth might have opened and swallowed him , for any trace we can find . I never saw a case that bothered me like this one does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , and yet nothing . The Inspector here will bear me out on that . " " You can let the murderer go altogether , as far as I 'm concerned , " said Lawe decidedly , " if only you will find Rilla Ravenelle and Peter Strangely . Mr. MacDonald tells me that you believe the body found on the embankment to be that of Martie Green instead of Rilla Ravenelle  --  or at least you have some idea it may be  --  and that has given me immense hope . But we do n't seem to be getting on very fast . " " Oh , yes we do , " cut in MacDonald grimly . " We 're getting a new disappearance or a new murder daily . Well , by the look of things , I 'd say we 're just about at our destination ! " His two companions glanced out of the taxi-cab window . They were just about to turn into a small impasse or square , containing perhaps twenty houses , eight or nine on each side of the street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fashioned in the same style  --  low , two-story affairs set back in a small yard , each with a straggling hedge or low wall to separate it from its encroaching neighbor . The houses were neat , and in some cases even cosy-appearing , but they plainly housed persons of the working class . The street was blocked already with the usual crowd of curious spectators who seem to materialize out of the atmosphere itself in the presence of accident or crime . It had been this crowd to which Inspector MacDonald referred when he said that they seemed to be reaching their destination . As the taxi-cab drew up to the curb in front of Number to , a constable who evidently had been watching with some impatience from a front window , shouldered his way none too gently through the mob in front of the little gate , and opened the cab door . " This way , gentlemen , " he directed , walking through the small front yard , where a snub-nosed child , revelling in the excitement  |  | Without quite grasping the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't touch nothing , as you find for yourself , sir , " said the constable to MacDonald as they entered the house . " The poor hap 's wife is fair off her head with shock at present , but a neigh , r lady is looking after her above stairs . Right through here , please . "  | XIV MURDER ON WHEELS THE room they now entered was the same that Lawe had seen the previous day , and was unchanged so far as he could determine , save for the grim burden which the old-fashioned bedstead now held . As they crossed the threshold , a small group of people , standing by the further wall , separated and came towards them . " Inspector MacDonald , I believe , " said the foremost of this group , a short , thick-set , round-faced man who advanced with outstretched hand . " I am Doctor Stutt , and I have been in attendance for one week upon the victim of this crime . " " Ah , yes , Doctor , " MacDonald acknowledged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly as possible just how the body came to be discovered  --  and who discovered it ? " " I myself discovered it , " was the surprising response , and then , in answer to the Inspector 's questioning glance , " As you know , Mr. Watkins had been seriously ill with a bout of summer influenza . His lungs were greatly congested , and he suffered a great deal of pain . In fact , he was often so restless from this pain that he was unable to fall asleep until very late . A mild sedative seemed to do him no good , and I dared not administer a powerful one on account of the tricky condition of his heart . But Mrs. Watkins had had occasion to notice that , when she came in each morning at two o'clock to give him a cup of broth , he almost invariably fell into an exhausted slumber soon afterwards . Accordingly , I gave strict orders that he was to have his sleep out . On no account was there to be any noise in the house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be awakened until I made my usual call at nine-thirty . We followed this program for two days  | h admirable results , and Mr. Watkins would no doubt have n about again in a few more days , had not this terrible event erred . " This morning , as soon as I arrived , Mrs. Watkins and I came tllcr to her husband 's room . To our intense surprise , the ? r was locked on the inside . We knocked and called , but there s no response . Greatly alarmed , I ran out and around the usc , followed by Mrs. Watkins . I knew that the window was ? n , as I had given orders that the sick man must sleep with my of air at night . An airless sleeping-room is suicide . " " And an airy one is murder  --  in this case , " commented Mac.nald drily . The doctor eyed him indignantly , his chubby face assuming a flied expression . " I was acting for the best , " he said . " In recommending air at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal tendcies of the London populace . Since you have requested an count of the finding of the body , I shall now continue . The indow is about six feet from the ground , as the lot slopes down n this side of the house ; and I am a short man . But I espied a ladder just over the dividing wall which is between Watkins ' little garden and the one next door . I hopped over and got it , brought it back , and climbed in through the window . The minute my eyes rested upon poor Watkins , I realized that he was gone ? and by foul play . You see , Mr. MacDonald , the poor chap was strangled " Strangled ! " " Strangled ! " " Strangled ! " He was interrupted by three separate exclamations from MacDonald , Lawe , and Detective Sergeant Kelly . MacDonald , for the first time , moved over to the bed and bent closely over the body . " But he shows none of the signs of strangulation , " he observed in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face . how do you account for that ? "  | The little doctor polished his eye-glasses diligently with his pocket-handkerchief before he spoke . " I told you he was strangled , " he said at last , " although what really killed him was his weak heart . Watkins died of sheer fright before the murderer had completed his work ! I told you , you will remember , that my patient had a very tricky heart . If you will turn down the collar of the man 's night-shirt , Inspector MacDonald , you will see the faint bruises made by the would-be strangler ! " MacDonald had already done so , and was gazing with deep pity at the brutal marks on the victim 's wasted throat . " I suppose , " he said straightening , " that the killer wore gloves . What about it , Kelly ? Have you found any prints ? " " None so far , sir . " " And I do n't think you 'll find any , " broke in Doctor Stutt with rather a shame-faced smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather an amateur detective myself , and I noticed at once the absence of s finger-prints any place in the room . As you say , the strangler must have worn gloves . He evidently entered the room and ; locked the door on the inside before beginning his work . In my opinion Watkins had been dead for about six or seven hours when we found him . He was certainly alive at two a. m. when his wife fed him his broth . " i i MacDonald and Kelly turned again to the dead body . It was as Doctor Stutt had said . Though Watkins had evidently died of fright , the cause of that fright had been strangulation , and the marks of violent hands were unmistakable on his neck . His eyes , wide open , were still staring as if in fright , and an expression of startled horror was on his thin , drawn face . What had those eyes seen as they gazed for the last time upon earthly things ? Inspector MacDonald would have given a good bit to know . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tally with those in the murder of Ralph Cumberland . The bruises on the throat , though much fainter , were almost identical in shape , and MacDonald had small doubt that they had been made by the same hands .  | Kelly , who had brought the necessary apparatus with him , was paring to photograph the marks . " The same lack of anything to go on , " he complained . " There 's ouch doubt that the last two murders , at least , were emitted by the same person , but " " The last two murders ! " ejaculated little Doctor Stutt excitedly . hat do you mean ? Have there been more murders of this imul recently ? " " I am not at liberty to speak plainly , " replied MacDonald , " but 1 I x l ieve this to have been only one of a series which have been Ix  --  rplexing us greatly of late . Whoever performed the deeds has n just as careful this time as formerly . Of course he got in the window  --  doubtless with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " MacDonald was now leaning out over the windowsill , being careful , however , not to brush against it . " I suppose those are your foot-prints out there ? " Doctor Stutt nodded , joining him . " Yes , they are . Mine and Mrs. Watkins ' . Even in my excitement , being somewhat of a detective turn of mind as I said , I noticed that there was not the print of any other feet than ours . It seemed very queer to me , for the loam is very soft just now . ! Icy , hey , Johnnie ! " He broke off suddenly and called to the snub-nosed child who had ridden directly under the window on his velocipede . " You 'll spoil any tracks down there with your velocipede ! " The boy grinned impudently , but rode away , and the doctor turned irritably to Inspector MacDonald . " It would do my heart good to trounce that lad , " he said . " The worst spoiled brat in London . His parents both were over forty when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him before , for I could see he 'd ridden over the ground earlier this morning . " " Oh , let the little chap be , " replied MacDonald . " There 's a big chunk of trouble coming for him later on . And I do n't think the velocipede marks have spoiled anything . As far as I can see , the only marks there are your own prints and a few , evidently made by Mrs. Watkins , following you at a distance . Although we 'll  | have to examine them to make sure . And these finger-prints on the window-sill ? They 're yours , too , of course . " " They 're certainly not the murderer 's , " said Kelly grimly . " He 's too clever for that . Though I took them , of course . " " Oh , they 're mine , " said the doctor . " I made them climbing in. , " However , we 'd best check up on it . Here , Kelly , take the doctor 's prints . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your rogue 's gallery , " said the little physician genially . " Hardly , " replied MacDonald . " But if , by any slightest chance , we should discover one among them which does not tally with yours , then we can reasonably assume that it is that of the killer . But I agree with Kelly . We wo n't find one . Shall we make our outdoor inspection now ? " A constable was called in to remain with the body , after the injunction not to move it until after the police doctor had arrived to make his examination . Then MacDonald , with his followers , walked out into the small garden . But , even at closer range , the soft loam showed only the prints of the doctor 's dapper little foot , followed closely by that of Mrs. Watkins ' . These were intersected in places by the criss-cross markings of the child 's velocipede wheels . Even with the microscope , Kelly and MacDonald were unable to find anything of further interest . " It 's uncanny , " remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The chap could n't have flown ! " " Of course not ! " said the little doctor rather crossly . " But I still think that Johnnie 's tires must have spoiled some good clues . " " I believe not , " replied MacDonald thoughtfully . " I 'm sure there were no other foot-prints here . And as for flying , Mr. Lawe ? well , I 'm beginning to think almost anything of this murderer ! He got in , and he got out . For he 's not here now . And yet there 's not a mark anywhere to show how he did it . The bedroom door was locked on the inside , so he must have got in and out through the window . Yet I feel sure that we shall find none  | of his prints among those on the sill . And where are his footf+rints ? You can see for yourself that this loam is extremely soft . It heats me how he avoided making any ! " " Look , Mr. MacDonald ! Look ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little round hole in the ground , as if someone had poked a round , pointed stick into it ? " " Just that , probably , " answered MacDonald , joining him and bending over . " I daresay it 's some of Mr. Johnnie 's work . He had a stick in his hand . " " Oh , I say , here 's another ! " cried Doctor Stutt , who , in turn , had started to peer about . " Just four or five feet from the first hole  --  in this direction . " He moved toward the front of the house . " And here 's one , " cried Kelly triumphantly . " Over here , farther on . In a direct line with the others . They 're very small . Scarcely noticeable . But do you suppose they could mean something , Inspector ? " " Look here , Johnnie , my lad , " called MacDonald suddenly to the boy who was now at the gate , having dismounted from his velocipede , and was entertaining a crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your hand ! " The little fellow , pleased at being the center of the stage , came running eagerly up . " You 've been poking holes with that ? " queried the Inspector . Johnnie grinned slyly . " Mebber I have , " he murmured . " Let 's see now , " prompted young Kelly , reaching for the stick . " Let 's see if it fits these nice holes . Sure and it does , Inspector . Look here . Just the size ! " " That 's right , " agreed MacDonald . " But , Johnnie , did n't Doctor Stutt tell you not to mark up the yard this morning ? " " Yessir , " shrilled Johnnie , suddenly finding his tongue , " and so I did n't , neither . Not once I did n't , till I rode over when you was lookin ' outer the window ! " " Oh , I say , now . What a whopper ! " accused MacDonald severely .  | " No , I did n't ! No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Johnnie stubbornly . " Well , then . When did you make the marks ? Last night ? " " Mebber , " replied the child , indifferent once more . " But I do n't think so . I think I just finded the stick in my yard to-day . Only I forget . Yesterday 's a long time ago . " " So it is , my lad . So it is . A deal has happened since yesterday . " MacDonald 's hand stole into his pocket and brought out sixpence . " Take this now , and run along . " The boy needed no second admonition . With a quick dart , he was off around the corner of the house . As his spindling legs twinkled out of sight , MacDonald turned to the others . " If Johnnie did n't make those marks , then who did ? " he inquired . " Why , Johnnie did , of course , " said Lawe quickly . " Of course , " agreed the doctor . " He 's a proper terror . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant Kelly was in a deep study . " The marks were made by that stick , certainly , " he said at last . " And there 's no other marks here in the yard except Doctor Stutt 's and Mrs. Watkins ' and them made by the kid 's velocipede wheels . But I 'm not satisfied . I keep feeling we must of overlooked something . Or maybe have n't thought of every possibility . As Mr. Lawe says , the murderer could n't fly in and out . And yet  --  and yet " And yet  --  he might ride ? Is that it , Kelly ? " questioned MacDonald , watching with enjoyment the three astonished faces before him . " No , I see you do n't understand , " he continued . " Yet it is quite apparent to me from the signs on the ground , that a small woman  --  or even a small man  --  might have stood on the back of Johnnie 's velocipede , steered with one hand on the handle-bars , and propelled the machine in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stick  --  to give impetus . The same method , in a lesser degree of course , that is used in  | punting on the river . Eh , Kelly ? How 's that for a possibility ? What do you say , Mr. Lawe ? " " It 's  --  staggering , if true , " said Lawe , finding his voice . Sergeant Kelly slapped his thigh resoundingly . " I believe my soul you 've got it , sir , " he crowed admiringly . " I do that . Except for one thing . A small woman or a light man , as you say , might get on that velocipede . But  --  how about a tall , heavy-boned man ? " MacDonald knit his brows frowningly . " A tall , heavy-boned man ? What 's that got to do with it ? " he asked . " Oh , I see . Still clinging to your old idea about Mr. Strangely , are you ? " Lawe spoke up harshly . " Absurd ! " he said . " All right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , Mr. MacDonald , shall I see if our doctor has come from headquarters , and , if he has , order the body removed ? And shall I have the velocipede locked up for further examination ? " " Yes , to both questions , Kelly , " answered MacDonald , watching the red-headed young sergeant walk back into the griefstricken little house with Doctor Stutt . And then he added , rather irritably , as he and Lawe turned toward the waiting taxi-cab . " Of course , this does n't altogether knock our last theory on the head . But if Martie Green committed the other murders , and if this is the handiwork of the same killer , then Martie Green is n't dead . And the mutilated body on the embankment ca n't be hers . Yet I 'm almost convinced that it is . How shall we reconcile that , tell me ! A corpse ca n't commit murder . At least , I 've never yet heard of one doing so ! " " And I , too , feel sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , too , " added MacDonald , still brusquely , " even if she were still living , and had killed this man , how the deuce would she have known we were on the trail of the letter she wrote , anyhow ? No one knew of it but you and I  --  and Strangely . And Strangely , " he added suddenly , with emphasis . " But surely , Mr. MacDonald , you do n't agree with Kelly , "  | Lawe was beginning , when that gentleman himself caught up to them on a run , his outspread hand extended before him . " Here , " he panted . " Look at this , Inspector . That kid , Johnnie , just hauled it out and said he 'd picked it up out in front of the house a little while ago ! " All three men eyed the object , thus presented , curiously as it lay on the palm of Kelly 's big hand . Then Lawe gave a short , sharp exclamation . He held out an unsteady hand . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawe opened his lips to speak , but no sound came . " Speak , man , " urged MacDonald excitedly . " Tell us  --  have you ever seen this before ? To whom does it belong ? " " That  --  is  --  Peter Strangely 's corncob pipe ! " replied Lawe hoarsely . " Look , Mr. MacDonald . There is the initial S ' carved on one side ! "  | XV A STARTLING DEVELOPMENT THAT afternoon Inspector MacDonald was not surprised to re- ' teive a telephone call from old Simmons , Lawe 's valet , to the effect that Lawe was confined to his bed with a heavy cold and igh fever . In fact , Simmons informed him , Mr. Lawe 's physician ? id the young gentleman must have been wandering about for week with a temperature which should have kept him in bed . 3 : ut Mr. Lawe was that anxious , the valet continued , that he ould n't rest nor take his nourishment , what with worrying and Il . When he 'd been able to keep around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trying to find the young lady . ! : ut now , what with fussing about poor Miss Ravenelle and Wondering what had become of Mr. Strangely , he was quite betide himself , he was . And he 'd requested most particular that Mr. MacDonald please send someone around to the house , to keep him notified about all the latest developments . MacDonald quickly consented , mentally remarking that Sim ? mons seemed extremely well informed as to the details of the case . As he hung up the receiver , the Inspector thought of Geoffrey Lawe 's face as he had last seen it the night before ? feverish , hollow-eyed , strained , and yes , weak . There was something pathetically young about this very weakness . The boy had ken laboring under a fearful strain . His sweetheart vanished ? perhaps the victim of murder ; a harsh and unsympathetic father with whom to contend ; no one , with the exception of the old servant Simmons , to whom he could turn for comfort or under-standing . MacDonald was under no illusion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fils . It was his business to know things , and there was little concerning the prominent families in the city , of which he was ignorant . Indeed , most of these families would have been unpleasantly surprised at the depth of this knowledge . He knew , for instance , the cause of the suicide of Geoffrey Lawe 's mother . He knew that the father , a stern , self-made man , had not given the boy a sympathy and love which might have led to el better understanding between the two . Lawe , senior , was not intentionally hard , but his was a cold , austere nature . The son was like his mother  --  hot-headed , temperamental , impulsive . One could not but surmise , under the circumstances , what adoration he must have given Rilla Ravenelle . Yet she had been taken from him . Well , the world was a queer place , thought MacDonald , sighing . It was a full day for the Inspector , but eight o'clock found him by Lawe 's bedside , a sheaf of papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . His visit , it must be admitted , was not wholly altruistic . He was most desirous of observing the valet , Simmons , while the latter was unconscious of being watched . " Now , Mr. Lawe , " he greeted his host briskly , taking an armchair by the bed . " You 're sure that this discussion will not excite you unduly ? You have your physician 's permission to talk things over ? " Lawe nodded . " Yes , " he replied in a husky voice . " I feel rather rotten , but the doctor saw I could n't go on this way . The suspense was only making me worse . " " Well , then , " said MacDonald , " I have several things that may , in fact are sure to , interest you . First , the Wall-Flower has been located some miles off the southwest coast of France . Apparently she is making for Spain . She makes no attempt to disregard our wireless messages , now that we 've managed to pick her up . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness to put in at the nearest port if we wish , though it 's plain she is very angry at the demand . "  | " What do you make of it ? " croaked Lawe , leaning back against pillows . His disordered fair hair , cheeks brilliant with fever , d heavy eyes all gave him the appearance of a tired , sick child . " I think there 's something queer about it , " returned the Inctor promptly . " I think the yacht is simply having us on t she has something up her sleeve , and is wasting all the time can in an exchange of messages , in order to get farther away . far she has offered no explanation for her abrupt departure . r men have orders to overtake her if possible , and to stop her any cost before she reaches Spanish waters . If she has nothing conceal , she will submit gracefully to a search . Otherwise , ' II do her best to outwit us and break away . It 's my own ? ' nion she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll soon see now . " " Have you any idea that Rilla Ravenelle might be aboard her ? " s the eager query from the invalid . " It is quite possible , " was the grim reply . " Either she  --  or her y . Always supposing , of course , that the body on the emkment was not hers , after all . If the girl is alive , where can be now , if not on the Wall-Flower ? We have gone over ? ndon with a fine-tooth comb , and all our outside operatives ve had her description since the beginning of the affair . There , re , I am inclined to believe that Mr. Strangely may have been tight in his assumption that Rilla Ravenelle , with or without the knowledge of her father , left home on the evening of July 17th , ? keep an appointment with someone from the yacht . " Certainly the similarity between the word wall-flower and the ? caning of the name Ravenelle is too striking , under the circum ? nces , to be merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rst known appearance of the Ravenelles in London was in corn ? ny with a sea-going man  --  or a presumable sea-going man . ( Of purse , all deduction is primarily based on assumption . ) Also , we believe that , in spite of Ravenelle 's vehement denial , he did receive quarterly remittances from Folkestone until a little over ? year ago . This is the port where the Wall-Flower put in on this trip . I have made inquiries and find that Captain Smith 's old ? yacht  --  the Dragon-Fly , which came to grief on the rocks some  | time ago  --  was also a not infrequent visitor at the same port . Yet when , a little more than a year ago , Captain Smith sailed from Folkestone for a presumable cruise around the world , the letters from Folkestone to the Ravenelles ceased . Now Captain Smith , with his new yacht Wall-Flower , once more drops anchor at Folkestone . And Rilla Ravenelle disappears ! Surely , it is permissible to assume some connection here . Yes , I think we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found aboard the yacht , the yacht 's owner will know something of her whereabouts on the evening of July 17th . I have had this conviction ever since you first told me of the existence of the Wall-Flower . The devilish job is to pick her up . " " I can only pray that you are right , " said the sick man in low tones . " This terrible suspense has broken me . " " My next point , if I 'm not tiring you , " continued MacDonald after a pause in which Simmons silently entered , drew the heavy window hangings and snapped on a shaded lamp by the bedside , " is the following one . A witness has come forward  --  a Miss Prescote , to be exact  --  also a lodger at Mrs. O'Brien 's . She testifies that she heard a violent quarrel on the Saturday before Rilla Ravenelle disappeared . This quarrel was between old Ravenelle and his nephew , Ralph Cumberland  --  ah , I thought that would make you sit up and take notice ! " as Lawe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ravenelle swore violently at Cumberland , called him a number of apparently unmentionable names , and finally forbade him the house ! " Lawe started once more , and the Inspector smiled quietly , quite satisfied with the result of his little surprise . " Quite so , " he said drily . " Would you care to hear the report ? " At Lawe 's assenting nod , he rapidly thumbed through the papers until he found the one he wanted . " Part of it is immaterial , " he explained quickly . " This bit is all that concerns us . " He cleared his throat and commenced to read : and knew that Mr. Ravenelle must have a visitor . I certainly did not mean to listen , but there are great gaps around the water pipes which run up through the rooms , and I had  | often been unable to keep from hearing Mr. Ravenelle or his ( laughter speaking . Mr. Ravenelle , in spite of his weak physique , has the voice of a much more powerful man . This day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I paid no attention . The speakers were conversing in very guarded tones . But all at once the old gentleman 's voice rose almost to a shout , and he called his visitor such terrible names that I was horrified . Then he cried out , " Do n't deny it ! It is all clear to me now ! As if we had not had enough to bear . Now then , you , get out of here before I kill you . If I ever see your face again , crippled though I am , so help me Heaven , I 'll squeeze the life out of your body with my own two hands ! " ' When the woman , Prescote , was examined as to whether or not those had been Mr. Ravenelle 's exact words , she said no , she thought not . But that they were substantially the same . When questioned as to whether she had heard him address the visitor by name , she said no . But that when the door of the Ravenelle apartment opened and shut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own door ? and saw Ralph Cumberland run down the stairs ! " " My God ! " said Lawe faintly , leaning back on his pillow with closed eyes . " What next ? Do you think it 's true ? Is this woman reliable ? " " I should imagine so . She is a quiet , conscientious type . " " But why did n't she come forward before ? " asked Lawe feverishly . " I confess I do n't understand these people who wait until the case has been running on for days , and then come forward with valuable evidence . " " She was away on her holidays , " explained MacDonald . " One of those shilling-a-week savings clubs that they have all over the country . They spend a week once a year on the continent . The woman did n't see an English paper while she was gone . But when she returned last night and heard of the Ravenelle case , she was much excited , and came to me to-day at Scotland Yard to tell me what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Lawe in agitation , as the full purport of MacDonald 's news came to him , " that Cumberland 's visits to  | the Ravenelles did not cease two weeks before Rilla 's disappearance  --  as he swore they did  --  but that he actually was in the house two days before her disappearance ! " " Exactly , " agreed MacDonald . " And upon that very day , old Ravenelle was heard to threaten his nephew 's life for some reason ; for something which he evidently considered a wrong done to himself or his daughter . " " But what are you going to do about it ? " demanded Lawe excitedly . " What have we done , you mean ? " replied MacDonald darkly . " Cripple or no cripple , Basil Ravenelle has already been arrested on the charge of murdering his nephew , Ralph Cumberland ! " " My God ! My God ! " cried Lawe again . " This is terrible . It ca n't be true . Are you quite sure of what you are doing , Mr. MacDonald ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without meaning it . And the man is practically helpless ! It 's reasonably certain , as we know , that all the murders were done by the same man . And Mr. Ravenelle could not be that man ! Even supposing he could have murdered Ralph Cumberland ( and I do n't see how ) , he could n't have murdered John Watkins , the postman . Or Martie Green , if that body on the embankment is hers . Besides , what motive could he have for wanting to kill Martie Green ? " MacDonald smiled . " The same motive he had for killing Cumberland , I daresay . We know that there was a degree of intimacy , or some shared secret , between Cumberland and the girl . " " Well , even so , a cripple like Mr. Ravenelle could never have dragged that body from Acacia Villas to the embankment , far less committed this last murder . Think , Mr. MacDonald , he would have been obliged to do the impossible . Do you mean to say that he could crawl all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's velocipede , climb a ladder , get in through a window , murder a man , and then crawl home again  --  without being de-tected ? " " No , I do n't ! " snapped MacDonald . " Though stranger things  | ve happened , to my own knowledge . But two new facts in Bard to Ravenelle have just come to light . ( You see , Mr. Lawe , otland Yard has not been so idle as you seem to think . ) First , r . Ravenelle , during a period of ill-health years ago  --  evidently fore the accident which crippled him for life  --  cruised before e mast for two years , as a common seaman . At the end of this me he had recovered his health . We know this statement to be tic , because we discovered among his possessions a diary which fors briefly to the fact . And he himself , upon being questioned , ? mitted it . " Now , as you know , one of the duties of a sailor is to learn to imb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feet , though the knees come into play to some extent . Now , Mr. avenelle is crippled only below the knees , and he is exceptionally rong in his hands ! " The Inspector paused significantly before ? e continued . " The second fact is even more startling . You member the tracks in Watkins ' yard , of course  --  the tracks hich I attributed to someone standing on the back rung of a hild 's velocipede and propelling himself with a stick ? " Lawe stared . " Yes . Of course . " " Well , Mr. Lawe , " said MacDonald impressively . " Our search to-day revealed the fact not only that there is packed away in the small shed in the back court of Acacia Villas one of those small wheeled vehicles commonly used by cripples and propelled by small pointed sticks  --  not only was the presence of this machine revealed , " his voice rose triumphantly , " but it had been used no later than yesterday , and on moist soil . There are still traces of damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " IT'S-UNBELIEVABLE , " faltered the younger man . " I am dazed . But why did n't someone examine this shed before , and see the machine ? " " Someone did , " replied MacDonald . " Sergeant Kelly , of course . All the premises were thoroughly examined , naturally , at the time of the Ravenelle girl 's disappearance . It would be only too easy to hide a dead body in such a place . During the first investigation , Kelly noticed the vehicle standing behind some other things in the small shed . Mrs. O'Brien told him that Ravenelle had been in the habit of using it occasionally , up until a couple of years ago , when he grew too weak . Naturally , Kelly attached no importance to the matter at the time . But to-day , after our investigations at Baron 's Court , and their peculiar result , he began to think back ( remarkable chap , Kelly ) with the result that he put two and two together . A second investigation was made , and  --  there we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels when he was so deuced careful about finger-marks , I ca n't think . Perhaps because the shed had been examined once , and he thought it would not be examined again . At any rate , after all his precautions , he slipped up on that one little point . They always do ! " " I ca n't believe it . It 's impossible , " muttered Lawe . " I should n't have told you . It 's been too much for you , " said MacDonald regretfully . He noticed the sick man 's glittering eyes , his distraught expression . " You must release Ravenelle . The arrest is absurd , " persisted  | we , with a tremulous laugh . " It would be tragic if it were n't ludicrous ! " " We ca n't release him , Mr. Lawe , " answered the Inspector . e 're glad enough to get him . Our men have been working ' ke beavers , and everything seems to have culminated at once . ere 's still more , " he added tentatively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " panted his listener . " I 'm afraid you 're in no condition to have me go on , Mr. we . " " I tell you I am ! " The young man 's voice was so emphatic as to be curt , and the expression on his face was so strained that MacDonald gave in , fearing that the lack of news might do more harm than the hearng of it . " There 's just one more thing , " he said , putting on his glasses nd thumbing through the papers again . " Pertaining to the aid , Dora Dupont , in the employ of the lodging-house-keeper , Mrs. Lugg . " " Pertaining to whom ? " " To Dora , the maid , " said MacDonald raising his voice slightly . " The maid where Cumberland roomed . Surely you remember her , Mr. Lawe . " " Oh , yes  --  of course , " replied Lawe , passing a thin hand nervously through his tumbled hair . " Just for a moment I could n't ? you see , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologetic , " and my head is whirling like a batty roundabout . Go on . What about this girl ? " " Just this . From the first , we have suspected that she could tell more if she chose . Now , although everything at present is pointing toward Ravenelle as the main figure in the crimes , it is believed that he could not have performed them all without an accomplice . Therefore , it is on the cards that there must have been one somewhere . And this accomplice , we have some reason to believe , was in Mrs. Lugg 's lodging house on the afternoon of the day Ralph Cumberland was murdered ! In short , we think that Dora saw him there ! "  | Lawe caught his breath sharply , his eyes twin points of blue flame . Inspector MacDonald continued . " Having , as I say , suspected Dora of holding something back , Sergeant Kelly went to her to-day and pinned her down  --  frightened her into tears by threatening her immediate arrest . After that , under close questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the afternoon of the tragedy , asking for Mr. Cumberland . When told that he was not there , this man then said that he was a friend of Cumberland 's and that he would wait for the latter in his room . Dora said it was not at all unusual for chaps to run in on Cumberland in this way  --  he always had a number of men calling  --  and this visitor impressed her as being quite all right  --  dressed in a quiet , respectable way and so on . He gave her half a crown and ran on up the stairs . She went on with her work and forgot him . About half an hour later he came down again . Said he could n't wait any longer , but to tell Cumberland that Mr. John Bell had called and would come again . When Cumberland arrived and Dora delivered the message , Cumberland merely said , John Bell ! Who the hell is he ? Never heard of him . ' But Dora noticed that Cumberland had been drinking heavily and did n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Inspector paused for breath . " When Kelly asked the girl if she had ever seen this man Bell before , she said no . But there was just enough hesitation in her manner to make Kelly wonder . He jumped on her , threatened her with jail , and she burst into tears  --  admitting that she was holding something back , but that she had a good reason for not telling all she knew . And she was sure it did n't amount to anything , and so on , and so on . But Kelly would n't let her crawl out of it . He told her that her only hope was in making a breast . So then the girl got sullen and said , " here MacDonald read from his papers , " ' Well , I tolt you I never saw the man before . And so I did n't , neither . But I never said I had n't seen him after ! ' Then , apparently , she became terrified and grew so hysterical that Kelly had to stop interrogating her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her swear that she would tell him all she knew about the affair when he came back in the morning . " The girl agreed , but said that what she had to tell involved Snother person . She could n't speak before she had notified that person . But , after that , she 'd tell all she knew , s'elp her . So that 's ; he way matters stand now . Kelly made certain that the person he wanted to notify was not connected in any way with Ralph timberland 's mysterious caller , John Bell  --  the girl gave her ? th to that . But of course she 's under surveillance every moment om now on . She does n't know it , but she 'll be followed if she ' eaves the house to-night . And we expect her to make her statement early to-morrow morning . " The Inspector gave a triumphant smite , but Lawe did not respond . He was lying back against the pillows , all his faculties concentrated in an effort to absorb as much of this tale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a note of admiration in his voice . " Kelly 's a keen lad . Since his interview with Dora , he 's done a bit of investigating . Looking into the girl 's personal affairs , he finds that she has been walking out ' with a young chap named Bert Brown , who has rather a light-fingered reputation , and who has actually been had up for suspected theft . He gave a water-proof alibi , however , and nothing could be proved against him . Well , here 's the point . On the morning of the day that the murder of Cumberland was discovered , Mrs. Lugg , his landlady , also discovered that some of her silver was gone  --  also some pieces of old-fashioned jewelry in heavy gold settings  --  things which she treasured very highly . But , in the excitement which followed immediately after that , she forgot to notify the police until much later . And even then no particular importance was attached to the fact , as it does n't come in our department . But Kelly stumbled on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present moment , he has come to the conclusion that Dora , the maid , ( in league with Bert Brown ) opened the front door on the night of Cumberland 's murder , left it on the latch , went with him to collect the silver , and did not lock the door  | again until Bert Brown had left the house . Under cover of the heavy fog he could make an easy getaway . " Now , bear this in mind . If this hypothesis is true , the door was left unlocked , with no one about , for a period which is indefinite  --  at least half an hour I would say  --  during which time the murderer could very easily have entered the house . Indeed , Cumberland himself probably returned during this period , if our assumption is correct , and the murderer very likely was close on his heels . Kelly believes that , upon returning to lock the door after Brown 's departure , Dora saw something which she has deliberately kept back , lest her evidence call for an explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , it is quite likely that if she saw the murderer , the murderer likewise saw her . And she has probably gone about in fear of her life ever since ! " That 's the way things rest . At last , the girl has been goaded into speaking , and I think that when she tells her story completely to-morrow , we will find ourselves in possession of facts which may lead to the apprehension of Ravenelle 's accomplice . Things seem to be reaching a head and clearing up amazingly . " The Inspector leaned back with a pleased expression on his broad , shrewd face . " The strides you have made completely daze me , " said Lawe rather listlessly . His excitement had worn him out , and he was lying back , pale and motionless . " How I wish I were up and about ! As you say , things seem to be coming to a head . And you can not realize the agony it is to have to lie here , with the thought that Rilla Ravenelle may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She is never out of my mind . She  --  and Strangely . Mr. MacDonald , candidly , what do you make of finding that corncob pipe at Baron 's Court this morning ? " MacDonald thoughtfully stroked his gray mustache . " I 'll admit , Mr. Lawe , " he said , " that Inspector Kelly makes out a very pretty case for Strangely as the murderer of Cumberland . And he will have it that the pipe-bowl shows him to have been implicated in the murder of Watkins , too . In fact , odd as it may  | cm , when he himself was the discoverer of that wheeled cart belonging to Ravenelle  --  he is rather luke-warm about Ravenelle 's rrest . He says , although the old man was very likely more or less involved in the affair , that we will find it was Strangely who .. ok that cart from Mrs. O'Brien 's shed and utilized it in order to ast suspicion of the actual crime on the old man ! The theory . unds plausible as he presents it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meone , of course , may have used the cart to cast suspicion on avenelle . That much may be true . But , to my mind , finding hat pipe at Baron 's Court exonerates Mr. Strangely completely ! " " But how ! " Lawe was plainly puzzled by the Inspector 's words . ' That seems a direct contradiction ! " " It 's very simple if you consider it carefully , Mr. Lawe . Peter : Strangely might conceivably have some motive for killing Ralph Cumberland  --  self-defense , for instance  --  though his disappearance afterwards seems queer enough if that were the case . Naturally , he would have known that any jury would clear him at once for attacking a night intruder in his own room . And , knowing Mr. Strangely rather well from our joint work in former cases , I always have felt that if this had been the case , he would have shown up to face the music . All feeling was against Cumberland at that time , as being a factor in the disappearance of Rilla Ravenelle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excuse his action . Still , he did n't ! And there we were  --  a dead man on our hands , Mr. Strangely gone , and no explanation whatever ! But , knowing Mr. Strangely 's character , to my mind his very nonappearance at once proved him not guilty of the crime . " The finding of the pipe-bowl merely confirms me in that idea . His business is suppressing crime  --  not committing it . And , if he was in that yard on the night of the crime , you may be sure that he was there because he was on the track of the criminal ? hot on the murderer 's very heels . " In addition , Mr. Strangely was the first one to attach any importance to the letter which Mrs. O'Brien mailed , and to urge us to investigate it . If he desired to keep that evidence away from us , there was no need to murder the carrier Watkins , who never  | would have given the matter another thought . No  --  the suppression of that evidence was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All he needed to do was keep quiet about it ! No , Mr. Lawe . You may rest assured that he was as anxious as you or I to learn the address on that letter . And finding that pipe-bowl only shows that he himself was following that same trail which he had requested us to follow ! " I am confident that all this time he has been engaged upon some series of investigations in his own odd way , and that he is doubtless reaching the goal just as we are now  --  but from another angle . Things are closing in about the criminal . Whether he is Basil Ravenelle , or the mysterious John Bell , or someone else entirely , his hours of freedom are numbered once the maid , Dora , speaks ! It has been , " he added , " one of the most perplexing cases in my whole experience  --  suspicion swinging almost hourly from one person to another . Think back : " First  --  Cumberland was suspected of killing Rilla Ravenelle . " Second  --  Peter Strangely was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspected of killing both Rilla Ravenelle and Ralph Cumberland . " Fourth  --  We were at a deadlock because Martie Green herself appears to have been murdered . " Fifth  --  There is a chance of Rilla Ravenelle 's not having been murdered at all , though where she is God only knows . " Sixth  --  The mysterious visitor to Cumberland , under the name ? real or assumed  --  of John Bell , is now sought by us as being ( in conjunction with Basil Ravenelle ) the murderer of Ralph Cumberland , Martie Green , and John Watkins ; and as having connived at the disappearance of Rilla Ravenelle ! As our friend Mr. Strangely would say ? ' Believe me , some case ! ' " Lawe laughed , but he was looking very badly , so badly that MacDonald soon after took his departure with a cheery good night and the sound counsel for the patient to try to get a good night 's sleep . On the way out , he spoke to Simmons , who was about to open the door for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand Mr. Lawe received a letter , yesterday  --  a letter which you gave to him when he returned home . It was addressed to you . " The old man returned MacDonald 's searching look impassively . " Yes , sir , " he replied . " Mr. Geoffrey ' ad told me it was coming . I expected it . " " Well , now , Simmons , " the Inspector 's tones had grown chill , " I suppose that letter had not been tampered with before its arrival ? " " Oh , no , sir . Leastways , the flap was sealed down tight when it come . " " Ah , you observed the flap ! And the letter was not tampered with after its arrival , Simmons ? " For the first time the old valet 's look expressed surprise . " Why , ' oo would tamper with it , sir ? " he inquired . " There 's only me to ' andle every bit of Mr. Geoffrey 's mail . " Then , as the import of the question apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man 's withered cheek , and his veiny hands shook . " I see , sir . You suspect me of doing so . Mr. MacDonald , I 've known Mr. Geoffrey since ' e was born , sir . And I was in his father 's service fifteen years before that . His poor mother relied most of all on me , during ' er last illness . I 'm not apt to pry into Mr. Geoffrey 's affairs , sir ! " There was nothing more to be said , but MacDonald walked out of the door , unsatisfied . There was something almost suspicious , something a bit too theatrical , too studied , about the old man 's denial of the implied accusation . And , after all , he had not really answered the question ! As MacDonald descended the stone steps he encountered Lawe , Senior , mounting them . The latter 's heavy face darkened as he recognized the Inspector . " Ah , " he said harshly , " I perceive that my son , not content with dragging my name into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned my house into a detective bureau . You will oblige me , sir , by not repeating this unwelcome visit ! " He bowed stiffly and passed on up the steps .  | XVII LAWE ACTS FOR HIMSELF FOR a long time after MacDonald left the house , Lawe lay weakly back , eyes half-closed . Simmons , coming in to place some fresh coals on the fire , stepped softly lest he disturb the sick man . Some charred pieces of coal fell through the grating into the fireplace , and the embers hissed loudly . But the motionless figure on the bed did not stir . An hour later , coming back again with some broth , the man woke his master , who had fallen into a light , restless sleep , and placed the tray before him . " I feel rather rotten , Simmie , " said the young man languidly , sipping his broth . " The day has been a thousand years long . I 've been lying here thinking and thinking what to do . " " The best thing for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man sensibly , " is to stay right in your bed and get yourself over this spell . Small use you 'd be to Miss Ravenelle in this shape . " " I daresay you 're right , " agreed Lawe , setting the empty cup down . " But I feel nervous , nervous as a cat . There 's a tension in the air . Do n't you feel it ? Do you remember how Dosie , my old nurse , used to say people were fey ' ? Well , I 'm fey to-night . I feel that something is going to happen ! " " Oh , Mr. Geoffrey , do n't say that ! " cried the old man , beginning to tremble violently . " As if enough awful things ' ad n't of ' appened these last ten days . It 's only a storm brewing . That 's w'at you feel ! " Geoffrey laughed . The feverish expression slipped out of his eyes , and he looked more like himself . " You 're right , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , it 's the storm I feel getting ready to break . It 's been as dark as night all afternoon . Do n't worry , Simmie . It 's only that I 'm so infernally ill and upset . " " And enough to make you so , sir , I 'm sure , " replied Simmons more calmly . " But if you 'll just lie down now and go to sleep , you 'll forget all them vaporish thoughts . To-morrow you may even be h'up and about , your h'old self . And no doubt there 'll be news of the young lady for you when you wake . " " I wish I could believe that , " sighed Lawe . " Well , I 'll take your advice , old boy . Good night  --  and thank you . " But the resolution to sleep was not easy to carry out . As on the night when he had last parted from Peter Strangely , he tossed and turned , turned and tossed . In spite of his effort at control , MacDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazy now from fever , nevertheless raced wildly from one possibility to another . Thunder rumbled distantly , and a wild wind sprang up . Where was Rilla Ravenelle ? Where was Peter Strangely ? Were they together ? Or was Rilla dead ? Would the Wall-Flower manage to outwit her pursuers ? Above all , what should be the killer 's next step ? What would he do now ? Was the end , as MacDonald said , indeed in sight ? If Dora 's information  --  ah , Dora ! Lawe sat bolt upright in bed . What a fool he had been  --  MacDonald , too . Why had he not considered this ? The murderer would strike this time through Dora ! Her information was to be given to MacDonald to-morrow morning . And the murderer , so well posted as to Scotland Yard 's activities , could certainly never let the girl live to tell what she knew ! Lawe strove to collect his thoughts . His brain was whirling with weakness and fever . His head throbbed as if under repeated hammer blows . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there was no time to be lost . Whatever were done must be done quickly . He would get up  --  he would go But , even as his thoughts took definite form , his muscles grew laxer and laxer . With steady insistence sleep was rushing over him . He was powerless to stop it . His mind worked more and more slowly . He endeavored to grasp his last thought , to catch it before it was gone . He had been planning to  --  what had he been planning ? Oh , yes  --  he had been going to get up  --  he had been going to get  --  with a sudden loosening of all his faculties , he lost consciousness . His relaxed body slid lower in the bed . He was asleep ... . Lawe awoke with a start in a house that was as quiet as a tomb . But , even as he lay wide-eyed in the sultry , pressing darkness , the clock on the chimney-piece tinkled once , twice and kept steadily on , and he raised himself unsteadily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should mean something to him . What was it ? Lord , how his head ached . And his mouth was dry as dust . Strange how he had fallen asleep so suddenly , all at once . Just as he had been planning something . What had that been ? Those hammers in his head beat until he could scarcely think . Zwing , zwing , bang . It was as if  --  why , almost as if he had been  --  drugged ! His mind was clearing now . Drugged ! That was it . That was how he felt . But why ? Who could have done it ? And what was it that he had been going to do , just as sleep pounced upon him so viciously ? Ah , yes  --  ah , yes  --  he remembered ! He had been going to get up . There had been some great need for haste . Well , he would get up now . His eyes felt blurred , and his knees shook , but he dragged himself from the bed and staggered across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled into his trousers . He moved with caution lest he rouse his father on the floor above . Simmons and the other servants would be sound asleep long before this in their quarters at the top of the house . He felt a bit stronger now . The mist was clearing slightly  | from his drugged mind . Why was he getting up ? But of course ! He remembered now . It was about Dora . Dora . Unless something intervened , she would be dead before morning , strangled by those same hands that had choked life from the girl on the embankment , and had then killed Ralph Cumberland and John Watkins . Yes , that was it . That was why he was getting up . He must be quick , though . Going into the bath-room , he hurriedly threw cold water on his head . It braced him , and he finished dressing without the terrible trembling that had hindered him before . But his head still hurt , and his thoughts were jumbled . One thing was clear , however . Haste ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassin soon would be creeping  --  creeping  --  up the steps  --  ah ! what was that ? He jumped at the slight , almost imperceptible sound of a door clicking shut somewhere below stairs . Lurching to the window , which gave upon the square , he peered out . There was not much light , but , by straining his eyes , he could distinguish a furtive figure descending the outer steps . At the bottom of the short flight , it paused for a moment , then crossed the square , keeping well within the shadow of the looming church opposite , St. Mary Boltons . Once past the church , with a quick , stealthy pace , the figure slid rapidly on toward the entrance gate which led to Cromwell Road . With a startled exclamation smothered on his lips , Lawe drew back . His mind grew instantly clear and keen . Simmons ! What was he doing , abroad at midnight ? And where was he going ? A vague suspicion flashed into Lawe 's mind . With a quick movement he crossed the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt dowered , even , with a strength that was almost uncanny , so suddenly had it come . Once or twice before , in moments of great mental exaltation , he had had the same feeling . Hurriedly , he jerked open the drawer where his revolver was always kept .  | Gone ! God , it was gone . Had Simmons taken it ? He would not be armed , then . But never mind . Never mind . At any cost , Simmons must be stopped ! With great , light bounds he descended the massive stair-case . Then , shivering from the plunge into the raw , storm-laden air , he pulled a cap well down over his eyes , and ran out into the dark night .  | XVIII STRANGELY PLAYS A LONE HAND WHEN Peter Strangely parted from Geoffrey Lawe at nine-thirty on the evening of July aoth , he had no real intention of returning to the room he had just rented from Mrs. Lugg . His plans were laid , and it remained merely to carry them out . It had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to do this , he felt that it was necessary to disappear , for the moment , completely and absolutely . To accomplish such a thing he must deceive even those most interested , for he never knew when a chance word , a careless phrase might betray him to some cunning and invisible enemy  --  perhaps even jeopardize his life . Especially did Strangely feel that caution was needed in this particular case . He had felt from the first that he was starting out to combat one of the darkest and most evil forces it had ever been his lot to encounter , and that the disappearance of Rilla Ravenelle was only one step in a desperate game of some kind . When he left Geoffrey Lawe he hastened at once through the foggy streets , by bus , to Cromwell Road and his laboratory , where he made a swift but thorough examination of the severed finger and the stained towel found in Cumberland 's room . The stains were easily verified as exactly what he had thought them to be  --  water-color stains , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the towel was still damp when he and Lawe had entered Cumberland 's room , the natural inference was that Cumberland had , for some reason , been employed with water-color paints immediately before his departure . Painting a picture , perhaps .  | Yet how absurd the idea seemed ! Why should a man , ev ' dently making hurried preparations for flight , stop in the midst of those preparations in order to paint a picture ? Absurd , certainly . And when Strangely had examined the waste-paper basket for possible tell-tale scraps of paper containing some sign of watercolor paint , there had been none there . The basket had been neatly emptied . So much for the stains . Strangely could link them with the case in no reasonable way . And yet he realized that most criminal cases were full of just such seemingly unreasonable things . He could not but feel that the stained towel would yet assume importance in the unravelling of the affair . The result of the finger examination was startling . Upon close inspection , the ligamentary attachments proved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , but of a left hand . Strangely , with his first cursory glance in Cumberland 's room , had believed it to be a portion of the right hand , because of the muscular development , as well as the large ink mark at the tip , still very noticeable even under the dried blood . But , to his surprise , he now found it to be the middle finger from the left hand of one either ambidextrous or left-handed . Therefore , since neither Lawe nor Mrs. O'Brien had spoken of Rilla Ravenelle as a left-handed person , until Strangely had definitely ascertained the fact , he could not but assume that there was , indeed  --  as Lawe had maintained  --  a reasonable doubt as to the digit having been severed from the hand of the missing girl . The whole affair of the finger was a most perplexing one . It taxed Strangely 's imagination to believe that Cumberland himself had laid it in its peculiar hiding place . It seemed far more logical to assume that someone else , perhaps a jealous confederate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast suspicion upon the man . But , if so , how could this person have entered Cumberland 's room and performed the act without exciting suspicion ? And why  --  of all things  --  should he have gone to the pains of putting it in such an extraordinary hiding-place ? Why  | not a more obvious one ? It was a fearful muddle , certainly . The more one pondered over it , the more involved it became . One thing alone seemed reasonably clear . Whoever had cut the finger from the victim 's hand , must have done so with the idea of obtaining some ring  --  a ring which must have fitted so tightly that it was impossible to secure it in any other way . Had it been a ring of great value , or a simple wedding ring with the name of the murdered woman  --  perhaps even the name of the murderer  --  inside ? Strangely did not know . At any rate , there must have been something about this particular trinket which someone considered incriminating , and which , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strangely could not believe that it would prove to be anything as easy as a simple theft . There ? as some far more sinister explanation . After he had thoroughly examined the two objects  --  the towel d the finger  --  he sat down with his corncob pipe , a pencil , and a pad of paper , and with incredible swiftness set down , in his own peculiar short-hand , the list of facts that he had gathered during the evening . Some were important , some unimportant ( at least for the moment ) . These latter he put temporarily aside while he juggled mentally with the former , dividing them into two distinct lists . The first was as follows : I. The Ravenelles had been brought to Mrs. O'Brien 's eight years before by a " sea-going " man . 2 . There had been letters periodically , generally mailed from Folkestone . Over a year ago , the letters had ceased , and , with them apparently , the Ravenelles ' source of income . 3 . Captain Smith of the yacht Wall-Flower had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , although he had put in there frequently before that . 4 . Rilla Ravenelle had kept a newspaper , dated the day of her disappearance  --  July 17th  --  and containing an account of the presence of the yacht Wall-Flower at Folkestone Harbor . 5 . Moreover , most startling of all , ravenelle was the rather infrequently used word for a certain type of wall-flower . From these data a most apparent connection was obtained be-  | tween the Ravenelles and the Wall-Flower . It seemed not only a possibility , but a probability that when the girl left her home on the evening of July 17th , it was with the intention of seeking an interview with someone belonging to the yacht  --  perhaps the captain himself . One could only guess at the object of this interview . If , as Mrs. O'Brien thought , the discontinued letters from Folkestone had contained remittances , then might it not be that Captain Smith had sent those remittances ? And that Rilla Ravenelle was going to see him with the intention of asking him to continue them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not sure . His second list was more in the nature of observations , leading to deductions : 1 . Rilla Ravenelle habitually carried a sort of brief-case in which ( or so she had told Geoffrey Lawe ) she took home work to type at night . 2 . There was no typing machine in the girl 's room , or , as a matter of fact , in the whole house . 3 . Therefore , Rilla Ravenelle carried home something other than night work , something which she evidently did not wish Geoffrey Lawe to know about , for she had lied . 9 . It could not have been bank-notes . Such a theft inevitably would have been discovered . 5 . Therefore it must have been something in the nature of information concerning the activities of the Coffee , Tea and Tobacco Import Firm of Lawe &; Son  --  something which would be of value to someone outside the firm . 6 . Granting this , to whom would Rilla Ravenelle have been carrying such information ? In other words , who were her closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravenelle , and her cousin , Ralph Cumberland . 8 . Cumberland was a frequent visitor at the home of the Ravenelles. 9 . Assuming then , that Rilla Ravenelle was carrying informa-  | tion to her father or to her cousin , of what nature could this information be , in order to be of use to them ? to . Something saleable , of course , as Ravenelle was hard-up . 11 . In this case , who was the most probable buyer of information ( type of information as yet unknown ) from an import and export firm ? Here , Strangely found himself at a deadlock . He could think of no such information that would be of value in a monetary way . Nor could he think of anyone who would be anxious to get it . But neither could he shake off the feeling he had had , from the very first , that Rilla Ravenelle had been a go-between for Ralph Cumberland and someone else . And this , at rather regular intervals . Added to these collections of facts were two more which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind . There seemed absolutely no reason for such a connection , and yet the two things persisted in linking themselves together . He could account for it only as being another one of those things which both detectives and criminals term a " hunch . " These were the facts : 1 . Mrs. O'Brien had mailed a letter by the eight p. m. post on the evening of July 17th. 2 . The severed finger carried a very perceptible ink-stain . The discovery that this ghastly finger had been taken from the hand of a left-handed person seemed to cast doubt upon its having belonged to Rilla Ravenelle . If the girl had been left-handed , Strangely believed that either Lawe or Mrs. O'Brien would have informed him of the fact when he had been seeking outstanding characteristics which would aid in the search . Therefore , it seemed possible that the victim of this outrage was not Rilla Ravenelle . The latter might still be alive . And if so , this was Strangely 's immediate concern . The rest could go until later . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely to trace the missing girl . Any side developments must wait . Accurately , he reviewed what he considered the highest proba-  | bilities concerning the girl 's actions on leaving home . And he saw no reason to change the theory which he had already propounded to Lawe . He believed that she had left her room at eight p. m. on the evening of July 17th , upon a signal from Ralph Cumberland , in order to keep an appointment with someone from the Wall-Flower . Strangely 's first objective , then , must be Folkestone . But , before he started , he telephoned to Inspector MacDonald , asking him to try to trace the letter mailed by Mrs. O'Brien on the evening that Rilla Ravenelle last was seen . Somehow , he could not get that letter out of his mind , and he was much afraid that Lawe , in his present overwrought condition , would forget all about it . As he had told his man , Tompkins , not to wait up , there was no one to see Strangely as he plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , no one would have recognized him . r ?  | XIX ABOARD THE " WALL-FLOWER " IT WAS as an unpleasant , roughly-garbed water-front rat that Strangely travelled third-class the seventy miles to Folkestone . His ragged cap was well down over his keen eyes , and he had changed his usual alert carriage for a stooped and shambling gait . For , although he had been only a few hours on the case , and was reasonably sure that no one was yet aware of his connection with it , nevertheless he was taking no chances . When the train pulled into Folkestone shortly after midnight , the fog was lifting sufficiently for him to make his way along the docks rather faster than he had been able to traverse the streets of London two hours before . He was afraid that the Wall-Flower might have slipped away under the curtain of fog , but he could not yet tell , since the mist was still rolling and swirling about him , and was far too thick to allow anyone to see for any distance ahead . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people loomed up , and Strangely slouched toward them . Two men and a small boat . Strangely strained his eyes , but by the light of the flickering lantern standing nearby , he could make out no name on the boat . By their dress , the men were sailors  --  and by their faces , tough customers . They were busy loading crates of provisions into the boat , and Strangely had an immediate feeling that they were a part of the Wall-Flower crew , hustling through the business of provisioning on account of unexpected departure . As they spied the newcomer through the mist , one of them  --  a great , hulking fellow  --  hailed him . " ' Ere , Bill , " he roared . " Lend a ' and ! "  | " Wot 's up ? " inquired Strangely stupidly , with as much of a cockney accent as he could manage . The man laughed hoarsely . " Wot 's up ? " he said to his companion , a small , red-eyed man . " ' E arsks wot 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ere , lend a ' and , do . We 're short a man , along o ' Ed on shore leave , and the Cap'n 's in a rare ryge , that ' e is . ' Elp us , and you 'll be well pyde ! " Strangely hung back . It would not do to appear too eager . Moreover , he was not yet sure of the vessel to which the sailors belonged . " ' Ow do I know it ? " he whined suspiciously . " ' An wot ship is ut , sailin ' so quick , ' twixt dark and dawn ? " " None o ' that , naow , " said the second man , lurching forward in a threatening way . " We ' as our reasons  --  and good and sufficient , likewise  --  for them as knows ' em . We 're a pleasure crawft , we are ! " At this point the first man broke into a loud guffaw . " Called the Wall-Flower , if it 's aught to yew , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' igh most gen'rally . Am I raght , Alf ? " to the second man . " Ay , raght , " growled Alf . " And swings ' igh , too , sometimes ! " The big man shot him a swift look , and turned to Strangely once more . He seemed to be the keener of the two and in charge of the loading . " Well , naow  --  will or wo n't ? There 's a guinea wytin ' if you ' elps us load ' em afore an hour ! " " A guinea 's a guinea , " said Strangely craftily . " Am I sure h'I 'll get ut ? " " S'elp me , " replied the man . " ' E 's no miser , wotever else ' e m'y be . So look sharp there ! " Thus it was that Strangely boarded the Wall-Flower . For over an hour he worked , loading the back-breaking boxes that Alf and his burly companion tossed so easily . His muscles screeched with pain at the unaccustomed labor , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come of the  | work . There was not a spot as big as a postage stamp , except the Captain 's cabin , anywhere on the yacht that he had not seen . And he knew that Rilla Ravenelle could not be hidden there , unless her poor dead body was even then packed away in one of the boxes which he himself had helped to stow away . But that he did not believe . His mind began to work on other possibilities . One of the crew ? " Ed , " the other two had called him  --  was on shore leave . That was an ordinary occurrence , of course . But , in this case , might not his leave be connected with the missing girl ? Might he not have been entrusted with a message for her ? It was not impossible . But , if so , why was the yacht sailing so quickly , before this man 's return ? Here Strangely felt himself on solid ground at last . There could be only one interpretation of such sudden sailing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in harbor some days , her provisions lying on the docks , ready to be carried out . But there evidently had been no effort to load them on the yacht , save in a desultory manner , until the present moment . Now the sudden , enforced haste  --  at a late hour  --  showed that unexpected word must have been received , word that made an immediate departure imperative . They were not even waiting for the return of the man , Ed . Such actions all pointed to alarm of some kind . But what could it be ? If Rilla Ravenelle were not aboard the vessel  --  and of that Strangely was by now convinced  --  what could have alarmed the master of the yacht ? Well , thought Strangely , he must find out . The next time he passed the Captain 's cabin , he allowed his companions to advance a few paces in front of him . Then with agility he slipped through the partially open doorway . The cabin , as he had noted from glances surreptitiously cast while passing , was luxuriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , with the exception of the ordinary ship 's wardrobe , which was standing with the door wide open , and was innocently hung with the Captain 's clothing .  | Nothing anywhere that Strangely could consider helpful  --  unless it was to be found among the small pile of papers on the Captain 's heavy table . Strangely dared not look further now , as another second 's absence on his part would rouse the ship  --  they would all be upon him with hue and cry . But , with one deft movement , his long bony hand had closed upon that pile of papers , and stuffed them down the front of his dirty jersey . None too soon ! Even as he ran out into the companionway , his friends were howling for him . On deck the Captain himself was waiting . The load just packed away had been the last one , and the master of the yacht was now ready to pay the new recruit off . Strangely had not , until this moment , seen the man face to face ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck , shouting orders to a Mongolian servant of some sort . Now , however , Strangely gave Captain Smith one good look , and was not overly pleased with what he saw . A big man , powerful and strong , with heavy , aquiline features and a hard , evil look . A man who would stop at nothing  --  a man who very likely had stopped at nothing , and  --  well , not exactly Strangely 's idea of a pleasure-seeking , amateur yachtsman ! He had been peering over the rail into the fog , but turned abruptly as the new worker came up . Strangely touched one finger to his frayed cap in what he hoped was the properly reluctant salute of the independent hireling , and felt the other man 's cold black eyes cutting through him like a saw through a piece of rotten wood . It almost seemed that he would be able to discern those purloined papers through the concealing mesh of Strangely 's jersey . " See here , " he said in a deep , gruff , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a shilling . " I 'm a man short , as you know . I suppose you 're not wanting to sign up in his place for the voyage ? " " W'ere to , sir ? " Strangely inquired , to gain time , for this possibility had not occurred to him . " I 've me poor old mother to support , and then , too , I 've not much of a notion to be voyagin ' far . " " I know all about those poor old mothers to support , " said  | Smith , smiling unpleasantly , with his hard eyes fixed on something or someone  --  Strangely guessed it was the Mongolian ? directly behind the American . " How would America strike you ? " asked Captain Smith slowly . And , quite definitely , Strangely realized that , if America did not strike him , something else would . They needed an extra man here , even if they had to shanghai him  --  and Strangely had no mind to be shanghaied . The situation certainly required a bit of tact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he would like to go home first and say good-bye to his mother . Smith replied with a snarl to this expression of filial devotion . " No more leave on this yacht ! We 've had enough of that . If you sail with me , you sail now . Speak up , my man . Yes , or no ? " " Yes , sir , " mumbled Strangely meekly . With a curt nod of satisfaction , Smith turned to walk away , and , with a single bound , Strangely was over the rail . It came as a complete surprise . Otherwise , daring as the act had been , it would not have proved successful . Even as he hit the water , Strangely heard the rattle and creak of chains and ropes , mingled with oaths from Smith and shouted orders . They were dropping into the small boat . The fog had settled closely once more , and , three yards away from the side of the yacht , Strangely was unable to distinguish her hull . He had got turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , and thus was unable to determine whether he was heading for the shore or the open ocean . However , he set his teeth , said a prayer for fools , and kept straight ahead with long , powerful strokes of his wiry arms . Fortunately , the sea , under its blanket of fog , was calm , and luck was on the fugitive 's side . In a few moments , he could hear the sound of rattling oarlocks growing fainter . The men in the small boat were rowing away from him !  | xx THE CABIN ON THE ROCKS AFTER about half an hour 's steady swim , hampered by heavy clothing and boots which he had been unable to remove , he felt shifting sand beneath his cautiously lowered foot , and half staggered , half dragged himself out upon a beach which he judged to be some way from Folkestone . As soon as he was able he got to his feet , and started along the beach . It was difficult walking , over the damp sand with the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so dense that several times the waves had lapped his feet before he realized that he was skirting too closely the water 's edge . In which direction Folkestone actually lay , he had no idea . But , from the length of time he had been swimming , he knew that he must have followed a more or less diagonal line to shore . At last he stumbled upon some rocks , and , beyond them , was able to feel a faint pathway leading up between two cliffs , rather in the nature of rough steps . By much scrambling he managed to reach the top , and finally found himself on what he judged to be a stretch of downs running straight along , and at some distance above , the sea level . He pursued his way with the greatest caution , knowing well the uneven outline of cliffs such as these , with their tendency to crumble , and fearing in the fog to approach too nearly the precipitous incline . At the same time he hesitated to walk inland beyond the swish-swish of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely on the downs before the mists lifted enough for him to see his way . Fogs such as this one had been known to endure for days . And in Strangely , coming as he did  | from a part of the country where even rain was a prayed-for rarity , English fogs never had lost their power to inspire a sort of childlike and shamefaced distaste . In London , with a friendly constable on every corner , he had become accustomed to plunge carelessly about through twisting gray mists or sooty black palls . But , jogging precariously along the edge of a crumbling cliff some feet above sea-level and bordering a wide stretch of downs , he felt himself  --  with a slight sinking of the heart  --  to be in a not-tooenviable position . He had hoped , by walking long enough , to find some sign of human habitation , but he had almost despaired of this , when at last , directly in front of him  --  almost near enough for his hand to reach out and touch  --  there loomed up surprisingly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what evidently was a window , and a thicker patch of gray on the gray of the fog seemed to be smoke issuing from a small chimney . The place was inhabited . Finding the door , he knocked boldly , and it was opened immediately by a tiny , shrivelled old woman who gave one startled glance at the soaking apparition upon her threshhold , and then broke into a perfect torrent of excited twitterings . The poor man ! Soaked to the skin  --  run down in the fog , no doubt , by one of them fast motor boats . A good , honest sailboat was n't safe no more , that it was n't , what with the water all full of these new-fangled craft . Well , the young man must come in and make himself to home  --  dry out while she warmed some porridge for him . What a blessing he 'd stumbled on the hut . Two miles out of Folkestone , he was , and must of been walking away from the town instead of towards it . And if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might of walked another good mile without meeting no one . She rattled on continuously as she spread his coat out over one chair by the fire , and drew up another where he could seat himself and try to dry out the remainder of his garments . His heavy , water-soaked shoes she placed in a little warming oven over the top of the stove .  | In a few seconds more a steaming dish of porridge was placed before him , and it seemed to Strangely , as he fell to with a rare good will , that never before had he tasted food so delicious . He swallowed it in gulps , to a running accompaniment of conversation . The little old woman  --  Mrs. Baker was her name  --  beamed as the dish was emptied . She confided to Strangely in the most naive manner possible that she hated these picky eaters . A real man had a man 's appetite , and he was n't a man without it . Baker had been a great one for his victuals . A fisherman he 'd been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ' ave lived in Folkestone or in Lunnon . Not she ! By the sea she 'd lived , and by the sea she 'd die . So she 'd got her a little hut , and she had her husband 's old smack , and Willie and Freddie Inger took it out for her . Good lads they was , and went half on the profits . The Ingers owned the next hut a mile further on . Afraid , here alone ? Certainly not . She might be afraid in Lunnon , but not here . And she 'd prospered . She was content . Folkestone was a great place for sea-food , what with the tourists in summer , and boats going and coming . Most everybody seemed to like good , fresh fish . Willie was taking a catch in this morning . That 's why she was up at this hour . When he 'd knocked she 'd thought it was Willie , though Willie most gen'rally whistled . And now , she wondered , would the young man care to drive into Folkestone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " she apologized , fearful lest her hospitality be doubted . " Visitors is that scarce I 'm glad to have them stay , and that 's the truth . But it 's foggy and a baddish walk to town  --  though the mists do lift a bit now and then  --  and Willie 's a social lad . He 'd be glad of the comp'ny . " Strangely accepted with alacrity , exhausted though he was , for his first thought now was to reach London as quickly as possible . He had already spread the little packet of papers , purloined from the Wall-Flower , out in front of the stove , together with the pound note that Smith had given him , and they were rapidly drying . But they had scarcely been improved by their unfortunate submersion . Some , indeed , were now hopelessly illegible , others  | were not so badly damaged , but , on looking through them , Strangely could find only one which seemed to be of interest  --  a telegram sent from London at 1o:ro p. m. and evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly from its wetting . Only one thing , indeed , among the papers had kept at all dry . This was a little oil-skin case which , upon examination , yielded up a small water-color painting . Strangely 's heart beat slightly faster at the sight , but for the moment he laid it aside in favor of the telegram . Upon examination of the latter , Strangely felt sure that it had something to do with the sudden departure of the Wall-Flower , and he was convinced that if he could but manage to solve the cipher in which it was sent , he might learn something of real value . He turned the paper over and over in his mind  --  a hodgepodge of words and numbers that appeared to be totally unrelated to any cipher he had previously encountered . Some of the letters were obliterated now , but it was fairly easy to supply them : " Twelve flow-rs sq-r- star six port thir-een - ive two st-r - ne por- five - tar - even - ort nine X " Supplying the missing letters , the message was no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , port thirteen , five , two , star one ( or nine ) , port five , star seven , port nine . X " Only one thing was clear at present . " X " must stand for a signature . Find " X " and it would mean at least a partial solution of the riddle , Strangely felt confident . The message had been sent from Euston Station , and he determined to stop at the office there and make inquiries as soon as he reached London . His mind flew on . " Twelve flowers . " What on earth could that mean ? And to what did square refer ? If only he could find the key ! Mrs. Baker 's voice , still chirping on , broke in upon his meditations . " Yes , I 've time a-plenty , but few enough callers . Queer I 'd  | have none for a month of Sundays and then three all in one week , less than a week to be sure . And I 'd not ' ave ' ad them other two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful wrench it was  --  and she stopped in to see had I aught to bind it firm with . " Strangely jumped . The young lady ! Had she really said the young lady ? " What 's that ? What d' you say ? " he broke in , jerked most effectually from his ponderings . " A young lady was here , in your cottage ? When was this ? " He realized that he was forgetting to play a part , but , in his eagerness , he had ceased to care . At any rate , Mrs. Baker was such a simple soul , it would not seem odd to her that clothes and voice did not match . He picked her rightly as one of those gentle , unsophisticated creatures to whom fine feathers alone spell fine birds  --  and vice versa . In fact , her very next words , proved this assumption to be correct . " Yes , indeed , " she replied , delighted to have drawn fire from her silent guest . " A sweet , pretty young lady and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cliffs , but the poor young dear 's ankle gave out  --  swole terrible , it was  --  so they stopped here to see could I bind it up for her . Between us , we fixed it with a strip of my old flannel petticoat , and then they went on . Staying at Folkestone , they was , at the Lion and the Crown . " " Tell me , Mrs. Baker , " demanded Strangely eagerly . " What did this young lady look like ? " " Like one of them ladies in the cinema , " answered Mrs. Baker promptly . " Black hair , she had  --  curly  --  and red cheeks , and a neat , pretty little figger . She wore an elegant light blue silk frock . She 'd been out in service , she said , but was going to get married . To the young sailor man , I took it , though she did n't say . He was smoking outside whilst we fixed the foot , and after a bit he called out was we done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle was braced , and she hobbled off leaning on his arm . " All Strangely 's excitement had died out , leaving only a feeling of cold disappointment . From Mrs. Baker 's words , he had leaped  | not unnaturally to the conclusion that the visitors had been Rilla Ravenelle and the missing sailor " Ed . " But it was clearly otherwise . Just a couple from Folkestone , out for a Sunday afternoon walk on the downs . " A real handsome gentleman he was , " continued the garrulous little woman . " Reminded me a bit of Baker about the eyes , he did , or mebbe it was the chin . Powerful built he was , and eyes as black as an Injun man Once more Strangely started . The words seemed almost an echo of others he had heard only a short time before . What was it that Mrs. O'Brien had said in her description of Ralph Cumber-land ? " Powerful built , he was , with hair as black as a Japanee ! " A mere coincidence ? Perhaps . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week , could have made a visit to the Wall-Flower . In fact , it was more than likely that he had done just that . But , if so , plainly it had not been in the company of Rilla Ravenelle . Who , then , was the dark-eyed , dark-haired , red-cheeked beauty who had been his companion the Sunday before ? From the old lady 's innocent description , Strangely gathered that the girl had been rather flashy in appearance . She had said she was " in service , " but that she was " going to be married . " Still , all that might have been said as a blind , in case Mrs. Baker should talk . Strangely grinned to himself . In case Mrs. Baker should talk ! She would certainly be a poor one to guard a secret . No doubt the girl had been telling the truth . She was probably a bar-maid or a waitress at The Lion and the Crown , where the man was putting up . And very likely she was leaving to be married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out . And she had not actually said that she was to marry the man who accompanied her . Mrs. Baker had only drawn that conclusion . If the man were indeed Cumberland , then beyond all doubt a connection had been established between him and the yacht . His visit might have been connected with the fate of Rilla Ravenelle , or it might not . It might  | Suddenly Strangely leaped to his feet , a great light breaking over him . Mrs. Baker gave a startled squawk , but he paid no heed . One part of the puzzle had dropped into his hand ! Captain Smith , of the Wall-Flower , was the recipient of whatever it was that Rilla Ravenelle had taken in her hand-bag from the offices of Lawe &; Son ! And Cumberland was the go-between for the girl and the mysterious master of the yacht ! It was he who provided a means of cummunication between the other two . Smith , Cumberland , Rilla Ravenelle ! They were definitely linked now in the accomplishment of some nefarious enterprise ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out , thought Strangely , and he would find the gruesome force behind the mystery ; he would find the sender of the telegram signed " X " ; and he would find the reason for the disappearance of Rilla Ravenelle herself ! In the meantime , if the girl were not on board the Wall-Flower , where was she ? Once again a stunning thought shot into his head . Perhaps that telegram , in cipher , had been sent by Rilla Ravenelle herself ! Perhaps she was , after all , a free agent . Perhaps she had never left London at all ! But why , then , had she left her home ? Perhaps  --  perhaps ? Strangely 's eyes narrowed to slits as he sought to concentrate on the problem . Could it be ? Yes , it was possible  --  just barely possible . Perhaps , for some unfathomable reason , the girl 's disappearance was all a blind . Perhaps  --  perhaps  --  Rilla Ravenelle had never left home at all !  | XXI THE GIRL FROM LONDON A SHORT time later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm once more , Strangely set forth in a small , dilapidated and highly uncomfortable motor-car . The back seat had been taken out , and the whole back of the car was filled with fish  --  kings of the race , he judged from the odor . Nevertheless , he was contented enough as the equipage coughed and gurgled its way along the uneven road at a snail 's pace , owing to the fog . While Willie Inger blew the horn with raucous insistency , Strangely was mentally juggling the loose pieces of the puzzle . Further questioning of his hostess had elicited nothing more in the way of useful information . She had merely repeated her story . The young lady and the sailor man had come six days ago - Sunday afternoon , that was  --  and they had stopped just long enough to bind up the young lady 's ankle . She had said she was in service , but was leaving to get married . Mrs. Baker had bound the girl 's ankle with part of an old family petticoat . The two visitors had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had , Mrs. Baker had been too excited to remember . The man had seemed impatient . They left immediately after the ankle was bound . Mrs. Baker had urged Strangely hospitably to come again , and , just at the last , had pressed a small meat pie upon him . He would need it , she said . No , indeed , no money . Certainly not . It had been a pleasure . Then she stood bowing and smiling in the diminutive , fog-filled doorway as Willie Inger  --  a huge , overgrown calf of a boy  --  drove Strangely away . " You drive early to town , " remarked the latter at last , wonder-  | ing if , by chance , his companion would prove another source of information . " Aye , " drawled the lad in reply . " ' T is a goodish bit , two mile , and I knowed I 'd not make time this trip , ' count of the fog . Them as takes goods to ' t ' markets is mostly fixed in ' eir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T ' folk ' gins coomin ' at five of a Sat'day . By ten , we 'm likely enough sold out ' n home . " He lapsed again into silence . " Did you see Mrs. Baker 's visitors last Sunday ? " Strangely went on conversationally . " Mrs. Baker 's visitors ? " echoed Willie , with a totally unexpected burst of enthusiasm , and almost losing his drawl . " I did that . Do yew know ' em ? " " I 'm not sure . I thought , from what Mrs. Baker said , that the man might be an old sailor friend of mine , " Strangely answered with what he tried to make an engaging frankness . All subtlety , however , was lost on Willie , who was merely anxious to talk of the visitors . " Oh  --  him , " he answered contemptuously . " T ' chap in sailor togs ? He 's naught  --  no more a sailor nor me , for all he was so got up . I 've see him in ' ese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and rolled his calf-eyes in ecstasy . It was not the girl , however , who interested Strangely , although he was at a loss to place her . " You 've seen this chap before , you say ? " he probed . " ' At 's right , " replied Willie , reluctant to leave the subject of the fascinating young woman who evidently had made a conquest of his susceptible heart . " Onct or twice afore . Onct alone , and t' other time together wi ' a sailor man , a real one , who 'd coom ashore in a boat . They was talkin ' a bit , an ' then they bo ' steps in ' n rows out . I took it ' ey was from some ship in t ' harbor . " " And you never saw him again ? " " Never till Sunday past . Wi ' t ' young lady . She were a pitcher , sure enough . From Lunnon , she were . " " How do you know that ? " asked Strangely sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on his own  | subject , though he conscientiously kept up the tooting of his dismal horn . " Well , yew see , Muster , ' t was thisaway . T ' young lady , or so I takes it , had hurt her foot proper bad . I see if two on ' em coomin ' out of Mrs. Baker 's hut , and goin ' down if road , her limpin ' dretful like . I had if car . ' T was cleaned for Sunday , for I was drivin ' to Folkestone to see my young lady . So says I , ' ere 's room for one . Can I take t ' young lady a way ? He did n't like it  --  not him  --  but wot could he say ? So in she gets . ' N off we goes . She were a one , she were ! " " She must have been . What all did she tell you ? " A slow painful blush , perceptible even in the dusk of the car , spread over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , indeed ? " And what would her young man think of that ? " he questioned aloud . " Oh  --  him , " contemptuously . " Soft  --  he is . " Eyeing Willie in a speculative way , as well as he could for the engulfing gloom , Strangely saw that in a raw , uncouth way the youth was really handsome , with a brute strength which might appeal to a certain type of woman . " And what was the young lady 's name ? " he inquired as casually as possible . But Willie was not of a suspicious nature . He had no wish save to unburden his bursting heart . " Martie , " said Willie , dwelling lovingly on the syllables . " Martie . That 's all . Just ask for Mar-tie , she says . She give me her address . " He fumbled awkwardly in the pocket of his coat with one hand , and finally produced a small , fishy scrap of paper which he held gingerly between two huge , clumsy fingers .
