Aside from his Valse Triste and his ringing tone-poem Finlandia , Jean Sibelius ' most popular composition is a little descriptive piece called The Swan of Tuonela . Written in 1893 , The Swan of Tuonela was originally part of a suite of four tone-poems illustrating the Finnish national epic , the Kalevala , on which U. S. word-poet Longfellow modeled his Hiawatha . Of this suite only The Swan of Tuonela , and another , noisier fragment called Lemminkinen 's Homecoming have been published and performed . The manuscripts of the other two fragments were lost . <P> But six years ago , when Sibelius ' close friend , aged Finnish Conductor Robert Kajanus , died , another prominent Finnish conductor , Georg Schneevoigt , got a chance to rummage in Conductor Kajanus ' attic in Helsinki . There he found the missing manuscripts : Lemminkinen and the Maidens , and Lemminkinen in Tuonela . Overjoyed , Conductor Schneevoigt got permission to perform them at Finland 's 1934 Kalevala Festival . Last week , in an all-Sibelius concert by the NBC Orchestra in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the Tuonelese swan 's long-lost cronies . While Manhattan 's Sibelians clapped their hands with joy , soberer critics decided that the missing pieces merely filled out the puzzle .
