txt // stages are passed , the stages of skill leading to perfection set in . At this period , more mature and more workmanlike methods can be employed with profit . The preliminary stages , however , must be initiated by the learner rather than by the teacher or leader . A shop can also be used in co-ordination with other group and mass activity . Many objects are made here by members for their clubs and for other group projects . The list of obj ects produced in one center by boys under sixteen included also objects for use ? ping pong paddles , bookcases , electric lamps , bread boards , wall shelves , checker boards , ash trays , tables , cigarette boxes , pipe racks , and so forth . These were actually put to use in the boys ' homes . The value of this is too apparent to need emphasis here . Objects bought in stores assume a new meaning to those who have themselves created . Most people do not realize that work was put into every item in use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If some do think at all on the subject , it is only vaguely . The dignity and value of work escape them . One must have experienced the joy of creative effort to appreciate it and to become conscious of it . Creative experience such as this in many fields , not in the shop only , lays a basis for constructive and vital leisure-time occupations . For , as already indicated , discovery of a sustaining interest or interests is the solution to the problem of the wholesome use of leisure . Young people 's experimental , manipulative work , at first seemingly purposeless and lacking in direction , begets lasting and more definite occupational interests and hobbies . Hobbies indulged in at a very young age may limit development of the personality . They are too confining ; they do not offer a wide field for experimenting with many materials and different forms of putting them in use . Hobby work has its objectives defined . There is a very definite purpose set , but in a good education , purpose and objective should be developed in transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance . Hobby work is also judged by the perfection of the final product . But , in true education the interest is in the process rather than the product ; in the growth of the powers of the boy or girl rather than in the attractiveness of the results of his work . It is true that education must bring about development , growth of standards , and better workARTS // manship . But these must result from development rather than be set in advance . It is equally true that hobbies may be discovered during free work ; but they , too , must grow out of preceding free work and from self-discovery . In one of the centers where creative arts and crafts were introduced , the " airplane club " had gradually lost its membership to the new enterprise . There was more scope , more stimulation in the latter . It had more variety and greater appeal , though the hobby director considered it a " new craze . " Our experience also shows that social attitudes are developed in a shop as concomitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , responsibility for the materials and the shop generally , seemed a most natural outcome from the relations in a free workroom . They need not be staged , suggested , or stimulated by adults . This confirms our personal experience with this type of work in other institutions and those of other persons who have conducted this activity on a free and creative basis . It is natural for humans to love those things that give them pleasure and that satisfy them . Thus , in a creative shop , workers are careful to leave it orderly and clean . This cleanliness and order may not satisfy adult standards , but standards must grow gradually from rudimentary and simple stages to the more evolved and higher levels . The habit of order can be established best through interest and co-operation rather than through punishment and scolding . As one observes the work in such an atmosphere , one can not help but be impressed with the friendliness among the youthful workers . In spite of the pronounced ego-centricity of pre-adolescent boys and girls , acts of helpfulness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Co-activity and mutual recognition of one another 's work is one of them . Responsibility for materials and tools is another . Still another , which bears directly upon school and center work , is " the sense of belonging " to the institution in question . This sense can be stimulated through the shop as well as through other activities . In a number of centers and progressive schools , much of the simpler carpentry work for the buildings is done in the shop by the boys and girls . Such simple objects as bookshelves , bread boards , shelves , ash trays , and side tables can be produced in a workmanlike manner even by children . // Many members volunteer to do this work in the absence of other interests at a given time . Others who are unable to pay club membership dues are allowed small fees for such work , to be applied toward dues . This plan is a welcome relief to many members and their parents . On these jobs higher standards of workmanship can be demanded because the objects are destined for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall in with the shop director 's suggestions . They grasp the difference between playwork and serious work . Here is an opportunity for development of workmanship and skills . The procedure for this is very simple . A list of objects needed for the building , and dimensions , is tacked up from time to time on the shop bulletin board , and those who are interested may make the objects enumerated . The leader may in other instances suggest to those boys who are temporarily at a loss as to what to do next that they make some of these objects . On the technical side of such shop work , the following are necessary considerations . A shop must contain a variety of materials . Originality and creativity require the materials and tools involved in the creative act . These materials may be very inexpensive : waste metal and wood packing-boxes , cardboard from laundered shirts . Young people find unexpected use for odd and seemingly useless pieces of material : pulleys , wheels , clock-work , old clocks , parts of old machinery , tin cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials and tools stimulates ideas for their use . They should , therefore , be exposed , as far as possible , to full view . Tools should be hung on walls or in closets with doors that can be removed or opened , and not in drawers or closed closets . The room should be so arranged as to give freedom of locomotion and communication among the workers in the shop . This means placing benches , tables , racks , and shelves around the walls , in order to leave the middle of the room unencumbered . Although this plan may not always be possible , it should be the objective in view when a shop is laid out . It is always a good plan to begin with a limited number of tools and a small variety of materials , and gradually to add to them as the work expands . Too much variety at early stages of shopwork may be overstimulating and bewildering . Some activities suitable for an arts and crafts shop follow : wood work , metal work , wire sculpture , puppets and marionARTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leather work and leather tooling , metal sculpture , mask making , airplane models , and so forth . If no science room is provided , some simple scientific materials such as dry cells , bells , buzzers , wire , and similar articles may be included in the shop equipment . An observation of free shopwork in a number of schools and centers indicates that boys and girls decorate and embellish with designs the wood , metal , and other objects that they produce in the shop . The shapes and designs of the objects themselves reveal efforts toward evolving taste and formimagery . Visitors to these shops confirmed our own impression and those of the leaders that there has been a definite striving for the beautiful in the work of the boys and girls . Designs on copper ash trays , napkin rings , book ends , paper knives , and trinkets ; carvings and paintings on the furniture , boxes , stands , table lamps , and the numerous other objects made of wood , as well as wood carvings ; sketches , drawings , wire sculpture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club and league affairs , and illuminated letterings ? all attested to art efforts by the young workers . The inclusion of art forms in other occupations and manual creativity is perhaps one of the best methods of training the aesthetic sense , for beauty does not exist in abstract ; it reveals itself in form , and it is desirable that the masses of the population , bring art into their everyday lives and into the objects of everyday use . This native art-impulse may make it necessary to include in the shop materials and tools that are not ordinarily found in them . In our own experience we have found it helpful to include in the shop equipment metals , water colors , paints , brushes , acids , tar paint , and other materials that would aid art expression as it relates to other manual work . An educative school or neighborhood center designed to serve the leisure time of its members and others in the neighborhood should aim to provide facilities for creative industrial occupations . It should set aside a room for a " Tinker Shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wood , in metal , and with electricity and machinery , where adults can come at their leisure to make things for use in their homes ? candle sticks , plaques , small pieces of furniture ? and to make repairs to worn-out or broken objects // from their homes . Many will come for creative self-expression with no utilitarian objective in view . Some objects made in the Tinker Shop can then be exhibited ; others may be put on sale for the benefit of the center , or the proceeds may go to the producers . ( It is assumed that a small charge to adults for the use of the shop and the director 's time may be justifiable in addition to the cost of materials . ) CHAPTER VII ART Among the universal forms in which the creative urge manifests itself in young people are the plastic arts . The graphic urge and the plastic-manipulative tendencies appear to be always present in all levels of human culture . They are equally characteristic of children and young people , and therefore form an important element in personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially the child and youth , becomes more intimately acquainted with the world he attempts to depict . By reproducing the world in terms of his own emotions and ideas , he attains understanding of his own relation to it . As one observes understandingly the free work of young people in the arts , he finds reflected in them the child 's unconscious strivings for clarification . The transformation of an idea or feeling into objective form ? expression ? clarifies that idea and relieves emotion . The purging of emotion through art expression also brings one closer to reality . Thus , art education , like any other type of activity education , aids in the development of a sense of reality . Mishandling , overemphasis , and subjective treatment of art expression may induce romanticism and introspection . These dangers are greatly reduced when the work is guided by the spontaneous and the free expression of the pupils . When the work is individualized and flows from the personality , it is likely to take more wholesome channels than when it is induced by an adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that art forms may take as applied to other manual work . In these , utility and appropriateness are the dominant considerations . Unconscious motivations make their appearance in such work to a lesser extent than in pure art expression . In the latter , subjective motivations can be made dominant , and it is in this aspect of this work that its educational value lies . In general education , art expression is of prime considera-95 // Lion ; not the acquisition of skills . In the expressive aspect of art , emotions and ideas are conveyed that either originated within the person , or had been suggested to and accepted by him . In either instance , the mind works over the idea or emotion through which the personality is enriched . In counter-distinction to this kind of art education is training in skills , where the emphasis is laid upon skill rather than upon the original emotion . Here , from the very outset , theoretical instruction in form and training in the use of materials and media are given . Meticulous work from models is expected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truer the likeness , the more skilful the draughtsman . This type of instruction is justifiable perhaps if the aim is to produce commercial artists , illustrators , or advertising Layout men , although in recent years , even in these stereotyped art-forms , creativity and originality have been sought . If , on the other hand , the aim of art education is to arouse art appreciation , enrichment of personality ? to make it more responsive to whatever beauty there is in life ? this teaching technique is stultifying . It cramps the expressive urge . " What most of us lack in order to be artists , " says Prof. John Dewey , " is not the inceptive emotion , nor yet merely technical skill in execution . It is the capacity to work a vague idea and emotion over into terms of some definite medium . " ' It is this capacity that is the essence of creativity . Emotions and ideas are present in varying degrees in everyone . Many possess skills to a greater or lesser extent , but the mass lacks the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of some definite medium " because of the stultifying influence of education and life generally . The mass of people have not been awakened to their powers . This awakening is the true function of education and of the creative life . Obviously , reproducing casts of faces , of bodies , or of bunches of grapes can not awaken power to transform emotion and ideas into creative expression , because there is no emotion or idea present . Such objects may be a challenge and arouse in those who are graphically inclined a desire to function through art media . We dare say , however , that , educationally speaking , very little development of the appreciative or creative factors of personality occurs through this process . Skills are im // proved . The desire to respond to the challenge to graphics is probably intensified . But the creative drive to transform an idea into expression that enriches personality and its value remains untouched . Because of these considerations , the present writer urged , in all his work with teachers , club leaders , staffs of shops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission for the spontaneous and original expression of their pupils to guide their work . Leaders and teachers were urged to refrain from interfering with the free flow of the creative urge . Help from them was suggested only when children found themselves unable to accomplish what they set out to do . Our technique was fully justified by results , for even if skills were not acquired so fast as they might have been , responsiveness to art , self-reliance , inner capacity , and the joy in work and in achievement fully compensated for it . In its early stages , art education should not strive to produce artists , but rather full and balanced personalities . There are those who hold that no expression is possible unless skills and the knowledge of the medium employed are first acquired . The difficulty this view presents is that , simultaneously with learning of skills , patterns of work are established : patterns of reproduction , of copying rather than creating and expression . Modern education holds that knowledge must emerge from experience and not precede it . Whatever essential there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its development and expansion require it . It is , therefore , to be expected that following the principle of progression ( see p. 53 ) , techniques and knowledges improve and grow with experience . To those who are not especially gifted in art , and where it is not a permanent interest , this experience accomplishes the educative intention . With others , whose special gifts and interests lie in the direction of art , it was found that early instruction checks rather than helps their development . It has been also established that the gifted individuals naturally seek to improve their skills . Techniques and direct instruction in these later stages of learning are essential . But , even here , instruction must be given in a manner that will not discourage originality in form and in the use of media . That there are some fundamental elements of art expression with which the professional artist must be acquainted is indisputable , but the acquisition // of these forms should not preclude the tendency to evolve new elements and new applications . If permitted , young people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of their environment . They seek to find expression for the vague imagery , the vision of a form , or of an effect synthesized from the materials at hand . Thus , paints may be mixed with clay , and in combination with a board , nails , wire , and other such materials , something original may be produced . A child may discard the brush and proceed to apply the paint with his fingers . After years of prohibiting this direct attack , art teachers have discovered this method very efficacious , and a type of paint has been developed that is put on directly with the fingers . The directness of contact with the sensory apparatus of the body seems to produce more vital , more sincere , and more dynamic expression . The flow of feeling to expression is more direct through the fingers than through the brush . The newly developed art form , hand-painted etching , has its prototype in children 's work , and " modern " art was a normal form of children 's drawings before it was traditionalized by adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large variety of materials through which the manipulative and the creative urge of children can find expression : clay , plasticine , paints , water colors , charcoal , colored crayons , wire , cardboard , plain , drawing , colored , and wrapping paper are among the materials that are suitable for such work . Among the conditions required for free art expression are understanding and encouragement from the teacher or counselor . He must appreciate all effort , irrespective of the quality of the achievement . The room environment should be flexible ; there must be free access to materials . A variety of materials , freedom to use them in an original way , and a quiet and relaxed atmosphere are among the other requirements . Most art teachers , however , have definite ideas as to what type of work is most suitable for their pupils . They set standards of achievement and impose them by various devices , such as marks , prizes , criticism or praise , and acceptance or rejection for exhibitions . The educative value of effort does not lie in the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the struggle for expression of the per- // sonality . Its value also lies in the striving for evolvement of higher forms and greater perfection . The teacher , undoubtedly , plays a very important role in this development , but his part is not that of a taskmaster or critic . He must wait until inner enthusiasm wells up , and then help its expression sympathetically , tactfully , gently , and suggestively . After the manipulative and exploratory stages in art work , it is to be expected that each individual will finally discover his preferences as to media and forms . This is true of all free activity . Definiteness is evolved with growth ; it is a concomitant of development , and the individual comes upon his true interest through his own effort , by experiencing the preliminary stages of experimentation . Such preparatory work builds skills , attitudes , and capacities for rendering the final choice more meaningful and more effective . It is this preparatory activity that develops the ability to convert ideas and emotions into expression . If this period is skipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the emphasis is laid upon skill rather than upon personality development . Art work as an educational process must , therefore , employ many media and numerous forms of expression . It requires a variety of forms and application of ingenuity and inventiveness . In its early stages , much liberty must be permitted to the pupil , in order that he may discover that emotion and idea can be converted into expression . He must discover the relief that a discharge of an art drive gives . This discovery is rendered impossible by control and instruction . Our observation of children 's and adults ' art work favors the conclusion that materials tend to stimulate activity and , in creative activity , also emotion . The presence of wood and tools stirs one to do carpentry ; paints , to do painting ; and clay , a desire to model . As the activity proceeds , it is quite noticeable that definite attitudes are aroused . Idle play gradually assumes form . Playfulness and care-free demeanor turn into seriousness and absorption . In addition to having a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chapter VI , these materials should be exposed to full view and be easily accessible so that the visual stimulation may be present . Jimmy , about ten , found a roll of wrapping paper in the art room and conceived the idea of " telling a whole story " ioo CREATIVE GROUP EDUCATION on a large sheet of this paper , which he asked the art counselor to tack on the wall . There were a father and mother and horses and farm houses and airplanes and policemen in that story . The figures were not painted but cut from colored paper and pasted on the background of the wrapping paper . After some days of this occupation , Jimmy attracted the attention of a few other children who joined him in " telling the story . " They extended its scope too far to detail here . Each participant made himself responsible for a section of the paper , with a definite episode in the story to portray , though there was constant exchange of ideas among the youthful artists . A very ingenious use of materials was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the supplies in the art room a large variety of wallpaper samples donated by a patron of the center . Very impressive combinations of these were made and pasted . on the , background of large sheets to represent trees , : animals , interiors of houses , and whole landscapes . Now , whit can , education do to promote personality development through art ? Some theoretical answers have been given in the preceding pages . On the material side , it can provide one or more art rooms , with a variety of materials , quiet and serenity , and a sympathetic and sensitive adult whose interest in the child-process would be at least as great as in the art-skill . In addition , the school and center can create an artistic atmosphere . The clubrooms and classrooms can be fitted up with decorations and other furnishings designed to stimulate aesthetic response . The walls of the long and dreary halls so characteristic of institutionalism can be embellished with frescoes , murals , drawings , and paintings . These should be the product of the pupils ' own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , and landing walls is a most appropriate project for the more advanced art workers and students in the school or center . Permission to decorate a section of a wall can be given on approval of preliminary sketches by the art director and a committee of the school or center community . The drawings can he plated in a succession so as to convey a definite idea or message , or they can be placed for their sheer aesthetic appeal . A row of these murals , either permanent or removable , may represent an historical series or stages in social evolution , ART laI struggles for social betterment , portraits of leaders in the arts , in the sciences , or in thought and social endeavor . These murals may be allegorical , symbolic , or realistic . The plan for decorating the walls by members has other values than self-expression ; such a plan would give added motivation to art work and study . There would be a real purpose , a tangible objective that would , at the same time , provide also social recognition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would provide opportunities for discussions on art appreciation . The entire project would tend to stimulate a sense of belonging and one of social responsibility . This sense of belonging is one of the important socializing influences , and should be encouraged at whatever point an opportunity presents itself . The more members contribute to the building materially , the greater will their sense of belonging be , and the more will their social development be enhanced thereby . In some schools and centers , art exhibits by outside mature artists are held as a part of the routine . Exhibits of the work of the members of these institutions should also be held . Older pupils or club members would do well to visit these as groups , to learn to look at art , and perhaps to discuss and to express opinions . It is out of these stray and occasional experiences that a deeper art appreciation can be built . ' The visits may be supplemented by talks on the exhibits , by meeting the artists and other personalities capable of arousing interest in art . Very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exhibit and consider them more carefully and in greater detail in the club or classroom . Someone acquainted with art may , after a round-robin by the members , describe the quality of the work , its specific form and history , its composition , the use of colors , and its meaning . I le may ask for criticism , suggestions for improvement , possible reorganization of the composition , and other ways of treatment of the theme . Biographies of great artists can be woven into such discussion-criticisms . Many topics for discussions will inevitably follow . Such topics as the value of art in life , the social message of art , what is great art , what makes an artist , and so forth , may be very elusive and intan- roe CREATIVE GROUP EDUCATION gible , but stimulating and clarifying none the less . They make excellent club programs . The practice of visiting local art exhibits in groups , and encouraging individual members to visit them , can be extended to trips to museums . These trips should be carefully planned ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club or class rather than be desultory visits . Our experience with younger children and boys under sixteen would indicate that museum trips are not especially popular . Museum trips are not particularly valuable unless taken for a specific purpose that grows out from other interests in the group . ( See Chapter XII . ) CHAPTER VIII MUSIC AND THE DANCE According to some music teachers , music has only two " universals " : rote singing , i. e. , group singing in unison , by ear ; and sight singing , or singing by parts . The musical opportunities of the average boy and girl of modern times , however , prepare them for appreciating instrumental music also . Nevertheless , although instrumental music ought to be gradually introduced , group singing , in clubs and at mass gatherings , is the basis of musical education in a center and school . Vocalization is the universal need of animal life . It is a basic need . The basis of musical work , especially in its beginning stages , should , therefore , be group singing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A complete educative experience consists of arousing emotion ( or thought ) and expressing it : stimulating desire and satisfying it . Vocal expression is a biological requirement for man as well as for lower animals . It is essential not only for communication but also for maintaining physiologic balance and organic harmony . Correct singing involves some basic processes in vital organs that are strengthened and stimulated through it . Singing is vibrated and rhythmic expiration . Viewed from this angle , its fundamental nature is readily perceived , for breathing is the source and regulator of all vital processes that are essentially rhythmic : the action of the heart , the blood flow , perception of light and sound , the digestive tract , and the total rhythm of the bodily processes . In our own work with clubs , in camps , and in some schools , singing was emphasized . It met everywhere with an enthusiastic response . In most clubs and in all larger groups , singing at once became a most popular occupation . Even among boys who are not usually responsive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When competent leadership Was available , original songs and music by the members were soon forthcoming . The response was always one of real enthusiasm . Our records of these developments 103 // show that clubs looked to singing and music with anticipation . ( See Chapter IV . ) Boys brought music scores , song books , and poems to be set to music . They veritably " hounded " the musical directors or counselors to get them to come to their clubs , and , when finally the latter were not able to make the rounds frequently enough , the boys took to singing without accompaniment or direction . This interest also took the form of composing on the piano and of " picking out " tunes ( often with one finger ) , with a number of the members grouped around the instrument , humming or singing . The emphasis upon singing must not be taken to mean that concerts , the opera , and music festivals should be eliminated . Pupils and club members should be encouraged to attend these , both in groups and individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of the musical education of young people . If a sufficient number can be found who can play instruments , and facilities to train them for orchestral work exist , opportunity should be offered for organized musical groups . A center or school with a musical department should strive to organize as many musical groups as possible : duets , trios , and quartettes ? all on a voluntary basis . The better of these musical groups can help much in creating a musical atmosphere in the institution . They can give concerts before small groups , before gatherings of several clubs , at parties and entertainments . At best , however , instrumental music offers expression to a comparatively small number . The majority can not participate in it so readily as they can in singing . Singing is , therefore , a better vehicle in the education of young people than instrumental work , for it offers opportunities for musical expression to a larger number . Another point must be noted . Young people 's appreciation is intensified through expression . Responsiveness to art , music , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teaching a child to play an instrument is no guarantee that he will love or respond to music . In fact , the didactic method employed , and the forced " practice periods , " serve to antagonize the child against music . It was found that a creative musical experience extends beyond the confines of that subject . Its relation to poetry , to the dance , and to dramatic expression should he employed in general education . lit conversations , through stray quesMUSIC // tions and informal remarks , such topics arise as the nature of a symphony , the origin of jazz , forms of musical expression , lives of composers , and the characteristics of music in different countries . In the experimental work under the direction of the present writer , a great deal of vital and meaningful information accrued quite incidentally through music as well as through other special activities . In one club the reading of Ibsen 's Peer Gynt grew out of listening to phonograph records of Grieg 's suite of that name . The leader described the dances that accompany the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressing the same idea or emotion through music , the dance , and through poetry . These learnings can be extended in a great many directions as the musical work develops : the place of music and singing in culture ; the relation of culture forms to contemporary musical forms ; the place of music in the mental life of man ; sources of music ; sponsorship of music in the past and in modern times ; musical forms in various stages of human development ; forms of musical expression in other races ( especially in Africa and the Orient ) ; the lives of great composers , etc. ? these could be some of the topics that grow out of such work . In addition to formal musical groups and orchestras , the " toy orchestra " must be mentioned as an excellent opportunity for expressing native rhythm . It also engages the play spirit . A toy orchestra is one in which the melody is carried chiefly by the piano or violin , to the accompaniment of various percussion instruments , such as drums , triangles , xylophones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tin cans , water glasses , etc . The piano or violin is usually played by an adult . Entertainments , festivals , dramatics , and group parties supply motivation for such an ensemble . ' The type of songs used in creative group work is rather important . Boys and girls , especially the latter , are exposed to " crooning " and " torch " songs filled with maudlin sentimentalism and romanticism . On the other hand , classical music of the masters is also unsuitable for undeveloped musical taste . School courses in music appreciation and the radio help considerably in refining the senses , but education can not rely entirely on these agencies . In the radio , especially , the musical standard is unreliable . Much that is bad is included io6 CREATIVE GROUP EDUCATION with a much smaller amount of what is worth while . Some popular songs have fine melodies and musical quality . Their lyrics , however , are quite stupid . Among the suitable types of songs are ballads and folksongs based upon folklore , stories , historic events , heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of these often possess a heroic quality . They have rhythmic repetition and a crescendo that appeals to young people . Their content can arouse emotion both through word and melody because of their stirring quality as well as their genuineness . Children and young people also respond joyfully to humorous songs . These should by all means be included in the repertoire of group singing . As a development , melodious music can be introduced : for example , serious and pensive songs , such as thoseby Schubert . The present writer has found marked response to more serious music and to some liturgical pieces . Reverent silence and peace and complete yielding to their strains pervaded the room . Not a murmur or a movement was heard . If a song truly expresses the emotion that it was intended to express , it arrests attention . Songs like these , sincere and honest , with no theatricality or savage appeal , refine the soul and enhance good taste . But appreciation of them must be gradually built up . Songs of various nations , many of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . Many of these songs are very meaningful . They are rich with tradition and folklore , and are melodious . The difficulty that the music of the masters presents in this work is that it too often necessitates part-singing and sight-reading . This requires more training than the average person has . However , songs and music of higher order should be a part of the educative environment . One method of accomplishing this is the interpretative concert for small groups . It is suggested that , in addition to group singing , fine music should be played ( for short periods , to be sure ) before individual or a gathering of several groups . The audience should , however , never grow beyond the size of a small , intimate gathering . Here a few short and pointed remarks on the music , the composer , the mood and form of the compositions , can be interspersed in the playing . This technique may gradually lead to lecture-recitals . The general principles outlined are applicable also to adult leisure-time education . // The class , club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in music . Material for such a book should be gradually accumulated and issued , preferably by age groups . These song books would not only be of help to the teacher and leader , and the members , but also to their pupils . It should prove a fruitful activity project . It is , of course , assumed that the work would be done entirely by the pupils themselves , who would have in their charge all the details incidental to accumulation of songs and of issuing such a book . Songs would be written by members for inclusion in it . The books can be so arranged that a song can be illustrated by the owners either on the page where the text appears or on opposite pages . This proved very successful and valuable in schools where the scheme was tried . The emotions aroused by song seek graphic as well as muscular and vocal expression . Music is not in the same category as are manual activities . It does not occur spontaneously as a response to external conditions , such as stimulating materials and tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more active basis than in manual work . He either initiates or suggests singing ; he accompanies on the piano , and co-ordinates the group , for singing and orchestra are essentially group enterprises . But , here also the adult leader must refrain from becoming didactic and arbitrary . Rather , he must aim to arouse interest indirectly , and allow the group members to take the lead in the singing , in the choice of songs , in arranging a song book , or whatever activity may arise . The music or group leader must be careful to prevent the formulation of a definite program in advance , though a tentative plan may be necessary for guidance of the adults themselves . The tentative plan adopted in our own work was something as follows : The place to begin singing and music is in the individual group and not in large masses . Observation of each group was necessary before active work began to ascertain the capacity and caliber of the persons involved . We found that the best approach is to have the music leader sit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , and play the songs the group may want to sing . We gradually introduced new songs as a friendly and comradely relation became established between the music counselor and the members of clubs . Later on , after the clubs had a taste of singing , the ro8 CREATIVE GROUP EDUCATION counselor waited for invitations from boys or their leaders . This was necessary , for it was found that the unplanned visits by the visiting musician disrupted other work of the group . In one institution where this approach was tried out , there were more calls for the music counselor than he was able to meet . In the latter part of the year , when mass activities increased , his entire time was diverted to large musical and dramatic enterprises of the clubs . The problem was solved when the counselor assigned a room where he could be found at stated hours . Soon members developed the habit of dropping in for informal chats , to play the victrola or piano , and to sing and discuss music , in addition to singing at their club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselor later arranged a musical exhibit : pictures of composers , old scores , programs , books on music , etc . It was in this room that the idea of group co-activity had its inception . It occurred in the following manner : Two or three clubs gathered once for singing , listening to records , and piano playing . This experience , which was new to them , gave rise to the idea of clubs inviting other clubs for various enterprises . This became a permanent feature of the club work at that particular center . Out of these casual group contacts , large enterprises involving fifteen and more clubs developed . Boys wrote many songs . The lyrics were written by one or two boys , but the music was usually composed by members of the club in a body . Each contributed to the final product , modifying and suggesting new phrasings and different development of the melody . The notes of the melody finally adopted were written down by the counselor . It is not possible to indicate here all the opportunities of extending musical expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention one of these forms because of its universality : namely , dancing . Rhythmic expression finds its most perfect form in muscular movement to the accompaniment of rhythmic sound : some form of music ? vocal or instrumental ? song , piano , percussion , poetry , chant . Indeed , young children respond to rhythmic sounds of any sort by bodily movements : swaying , skipping , arm and head motion , and embryonic dancing . If cultural taboos did not check this form of spontaneous and automatic response , it would be carried into adulthood . Among adults the occasions for dancing are more or less defined , and , though the // impulse for it may arise at other times , habit and gradual conditioning reserve its appearance for specific groupapproved occasions . The dance rhythm , however , is ever present in the human organization ; and , if its expression can be made pleasing and beautiful , much joy and peace can be derived from it . Through the dance are activated root processes in the organism , and the very core of being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free dance expression and later give it form and richness through proper training . There are at present a great number of " systems " of dance instruction . The systems to be preferred are those that permit the child the greatest degree of free self-expression and afford the adult the most opportunity for creative imagination and an honest release to his emotions . It should be kept in mind that one of the important values of the dance is co-ordination of aural , nerve , and muscular rhythm . This co-ordination strengthens poise and develops power . In leisure-time education , formal aesthetic dancing classes for adults may be in place . It will be found , however , that boys almost never join these dance groups ( unless it be social or ballroom dancing ) . Girls come to such groups in very small numbers . Aesthetic or interpretive dancing can be best introduced through inclusion in plays , recitals , pageants , and other forms of dramatic expression . These purposive performances will serve to re-awaken the rhythmic sense on a higher level than it is usually expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group in a " progressive " school held a series of discussions under the general title of Social Science . They studied the different nationalities in the melting pot of New York . Trips to various parts of the city were made , where the children became acquainted with peoples of strange habits and unfamiliar tongues . Markets were visited , and the life of the foreign population studied . Much local color was thus gathered and the children came to know some general characteristics of several nationalities : their appearance , dress , habits . Representative men and women of these nationalities were invited by the teacher to talk to the class on conditions in their respective countries , their customs , history , art , and literature . The children asked many questions and did much reading in connection with this general interest . Some clipped material from newspapers and magazines and kept it in special folders . When the matter of giving a play came up ( to be given in the auditorium for the entire school and parents ) , the majority of the class voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the poetic and mythical quality of the Irish folklore and legends , and set out to work on plots with great gusto . At first a general outline was prepared by a girl of twelve , who had borrowed characters from a number of Irish legends and had woven them into one tale . It would be difficult for even the most learned savant on Irish literature to recognize these characters save for their names , though the spirit of the Irish legends was fully retained . The plan , however , was not a final one ; for it had been decided at a special meeting of the class that only a very general outline be submitted , because , as one girl put it , " We may add to it when we get into the excitement of it and think of things that we never thought of before . We can give the general idea of it , but all the things we give , we will probably charge a great deal . " The children set out conscientiously to make the play a IIO DRAMATICS AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the original plan . A dance of the mermaids , a feast , and a legend to be told by the Scribe were also gradually introduced in rehearsals . One of the questions that was hotly debated was whether it was necessary to have a love story . It was decided that there was no need for this , since in the opinion of the young playwrights , " there was some very good reading that had no love story in it . " The composite result consisted of the following yarn : There was once in Ireland a happy , jolly , and lovely fellow named Finn . He was the leader of a tribe called Feina and very much beloved by his tribesmen . He was a warrior and " a nice big soldier , who killed a lot of people ? had people . " One bad-hearted person , Grania , who wore a green gown , was really a snake , but transformed herself into a pretty girl . Grania and Finn were mortal enemies . ( Evidently Finn represents the good spirit , Grania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Finn , is having a feast in Finn 's palace , with all the warriors gathered . Grania , in the guise of a beautiful young lady , comes bearing wine for the brave and noble Gaul and his knights , the berries for which she has gathered herself in the marshes of Ireland , and squeezed the wine from them with her own hands . By her charms she persuades everybody present to drink . But this wine has been " enchanted , " and all fall asleep . Finn 's men will remain under the spell forever , unless he can find a trumpet , blow it three times , and arouse them . But this trumpet is hidden and no one knows where it is , except the King of the Sea , who has a son , the Sea Monster . The King of the Sea lives in Moy Mell , which is filled with Mermaids and seagrass . Shinackay is a story-teller who warns Finn , on his return , of the evil that has befallen his knights , and they both set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A battle ensues between Finn and the Sea King . Finn is victorious and the Sea King is forced to help Finn find the trumpet . During the next act Finn enters Grania 's cave , where she is plotting his destruction . But Finn , having obtained " the magic power of perfect knowledge by eating a salmon found in Moy Mell , " now has the power over Grania , whom he transforms into the spirit of the air . With his trumpet and the " Tooth of Knowledge " ( this was also the name of the play ) , he returns to the palace , blows the horn , and is received by his band with great joy and jollification . The list of characters in the play was as follows : The // Scribe , the Minister , Gaul , Grania , Shinackay , Finn , King of the Sea , Sea Monster , Oracle , Knights of the Feina , Mermaids of Moy Mell . It can be readily seen that the story is entirely original : only the spirit of the Irish legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had held many rehearsals and made many changes as they went on with it . New characters and new elements were introduced through suggestions from individual children , and the final play was quite different from the plot originally submitted . The final result was the product of a co-operative mind , of a give-andtake process , in which everyone took part . As the time for the performance was approaching , each child was assigned special duties incidental to the production of the play . Several had charge of the scenery . Some had to see that children made the costumes for themselves on time . Others were put in charge of the lighting effects . Costumes , decorations and settings were evolved as new ideas were introduced by the co-operating authors and players . In this connection , it is possible to gauge the level of development , resourcefulness , and information of the children . The more developed they are , the more variegated and perfect is the final product . These children had learned to use dyes ; they therefore dyed their costumes instead of buying colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the girls in this group and some of the boys as well did a great deal of painting . As a result they painted the scenery . They also made curtains and some of the furniture . Their proficiency in shopwork made itself felt in many ways during the setting of the play . Knowledge of scientific facts was made use of , and information of every kind was borrowed to produce the final whole . For example , the concept of a " nucleus " was introduced by the children in the final plan of the play and their fine feeling for language is clearly shown by the following lines ? two of many similar ones . At one point Shinackay says : " Come , Oh Finn , I know the way in my dreams . " At another , Grania claims , " My charms are blue and green . " 2 Expression in dramatic form is motivated by what seems to be a primary tendency of impersonation . Anthropologists // find that impersonation is practiced universally by primitives . Their ceremonials , religious rites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their amusements and festivities . According to the occasion , they impersonate animals , natural objects , crops , and spirits . This tendency to impersonate is as com mon with children as it is among the primitives . Like the primitives , they impersonate animas , flowers , parents , teachers . Just what the place of this tendency is in the social and psychological development of man is obscure , but an analysis of the content of play making may throw some light . Those who have observed children 's self-originated plays , dramatics , pantomime , etc. , have come to the conclusion that the children identify themselves with the objects or persons that they represent . In phantasy they become endowed with the virtues and the powers possessed by the assumed characters and objects , and in numerous instances the characters chosen for impersonation are those that are closest to their hearts . Whatever the reasons for such behavior may be , an education that seeks to intensify and develop native predilections and individual characteristics can not minimize the importance and value of creative dramatics . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impersonate , it also offers opportunities for original and creative work in many forms . " The drama , more than any other single art , represents an integration of all the processes of self-expression . It is at once the most completely personal , individualistic and intimate , as well as the highly socialized art . Rich in content , varied in means , it represents also an effective union of intellect and emotion . Hence its creative possibilities are practically unlimited . As already indicated , the enrichment and strengthening of personality occurs through the use of the components that constitute it ; and since impersonation , manual work , art , design , music , and group activity ? all of which are involved in creative dramatics ? are such components , its educative value becomes at once apparent . But though dramatics , as an expression , is an excellent educational medium , the real value lies in its creative aspect rather than in the producing of plays in the conventional sense . There is little educational value in the type of play production in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to memorize lines and to recite them at a given cue , with gestures and intonation carefully and persistently drilled by an adult . This type of dramatic work makes of the participants automatons and puppets , and runs counter to the central intention of personality education . The appeal of the ordinary dramatic performance is almost entirely to ego-centric interests , such as exhibitionism , selfassertion , power , desire to attract attention , to occupy the center of the stage , to make believe as an escape from reality . Again , the superficiality with which the youthful actors represent characters in plays leads to half-learning and to confusion . They do not acquire any understanding of the character 's problems . They do not learn to appreciate his conflicts , or grasp the significance of the plot and dramatic situation . This type of dramatics encourages superficial thinking and unsympathetic response to others . Character education , on the contrary , ought to emphasize sincerity and honesty , thoughtfulness , insight and sympathy ? characteristics that are not engendered by mere impersonation . In the light of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs of younger people , traditional club programming notwithstanding . Play producing , like most of the traditional club and school devices , may engage the group and keep it busy . In view of the fact that there are so many more worth-while occupations a group can engage in , however , this type of dramatic work may prove wasteful by contrast . Dramatics are nearly always promoted and directed by adult leaders , though some details may be carried out by a few of the members . In our own observation , play producing is resorted to as a means of filling time , to give the group " something to do . " The contention that play producing is essentially a group enterprise , and therefore valuable in social education , is only partially justifiable . In most instances it involves only few of the members and is not motivated by a group feeling . The few are selected from the group on a competitive basis . The method commonly employed in amateur acting ? that of representing a character without a deep comprehension of its nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character with such understanding or sympathy as to he able actually to experience the emotions and conflicts of // such a character , we shall designate as acting by identification . It would seem of little value for a growing personality and a groping intellect to imitate characters theatrically , and ' therefore insincerely . To imitate the bearing , gestures , and voice of a character without a deeper responsiveness to it is of no educational significance . Personality growth and the expansion of emotional horizons require a thoroughgoing understanding of the play , its meaning , its significance , and the nature of the characters and their emotions . The preference for plays that deal with characters and situations on their own level is displayed by boys and girls whenever an opportunity presents itself . The customary method of choosing plays blocks this tendency . Conventionally , plays are chosen from a repertoire of material for adults or written by adults for children , but with the adult point of view . Some of these plays become more or less incorporated into the tradition of a given school or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study made of creative dramatics under the direction of the present writer , it was found that boys fourteen to sixteen years of age " pounced upon plays that consisted of characters of their own age . They then proceeded on their own to analyze the behavior and reactions of these characters and to compare them with their own . " Obviously , the interest and ability to make such analyses and comparisons would not exist if the age discrepancy between the actors and the characters were too great . In the same study , a test was made as to topical interests in dramatics of boys and girls eighteen to twenty years old . The approach was made through original play writing . The topics suggested by them , and which are discussed later in the chapter , indicate that many of the plots dealt with problems and situations that concerned them in their everyday life . Among the many significant responses , one will be noted here for its special importance . Almost the first response to the suggestion for writing and producing an original play was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impersonate can be used for the ends of personality enrichment , enhancement of power of expression and communication , and the development of creative imagination . This can best be achieved , however , by means of original plots , situations , and dialogue that grow out of and reflect the experience , feelings , and thought of the partici116 CREATIVE GROUP EDUCATION pants . Under these conditions , acting is not mere simulation , but rather a deeper and more meaningful process of identification . In adult dramatics , as well , a play should first be discussed as a work of art , as literature , as a social treatise , as a psychological character analysis , as a doctrine , as an intention on the part of the writer , before it is put into rehearsal . Questions such as the function of the drama as a social force , as a form of art , as propaganda , as a form of expression , and such other elements and phases should be brought out in group discussion in advance of production . Analysis of the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their motives and symbolism should be considered . By these means , a dramatic group can also become educational , which should be the true function of amateur dramatics. 3 Some professional directors maintain that objective consideration and intellectual comprehension of the play and characters attenuates the subtlety of the acting : that the actor must respond to nuances of the play-situation unconsciously and sensitively rather than intellectually . Such organizations as the Moscow Art Theatre , for example , disprove this contention ; but even if this were not true , the technique employed in professional production is not suitable for education . The emphasis in professional production is entirely upon external effects ; in educational production , the end aimed at in a play is its developmental value to the participants . " The weakness of professionalism is its unimaginative attitude toward the latent enthusiasm and ability . . . . " says Mrs. Mary K. Simkhovitch in reference to the readiness for service in the community ; but her comment is equally true of all educational effort . The specialist places his subject and his technique-process above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than child-motivated . It is a noteworthy fact that the most significant changes in education were wrought ' by non-professional persons . Progress in nearly all human effort involves an attack by non professional but gifted individuals upon traditional and rigidly adhered-to techniques and attitudes . The great need , therefore , is the proper choice of teachers and directors whose responsiveness to the creative drives of the pupils is // of greater consideration than their information and subjectknowledge . The latter can be easily acquired ; the former is largely an innate attribute found only among persons who have themselves experienced the revelations of a creative urge expressed and translated into palpable forms . Adult as well as children 's groups need not confine themselves to plays . As a matter of fact , play writing and production are a rather advanced form of dramatic expression . Other and simpler forms are more suitable in the early stages of dramatic work . Mime , impersonations , puppets , and marionettes ( including cardboard figures ) , pageants , and festivals are means simpler and more suitable for the beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most common and most valuable dramatic forms for general personality development are the imaginative dramatization and impersonation that occur spontaneously in children 's free group and individual play . This imaginative re-interpretation of experience and thought and discharge of phantasy are valuable both for learning about the world and for emotional release . Free impersonation involves identification and , therefore , a deeper understanding and sympathy . The child learns to like a puppy by being a puppy . It is not possible at the present juncture to discuss the value and function of phantasy in the development of personality , but it need be stated that the expression of phantasy in objective forms increases the sense of reality . A good education , therefore , seizes at every opportunity and at all forms of dramatic expression as they appear informally and spontaneously . The teacher or club leader introduces conscious direction at points where the spontaneous impulsion needs definite and satisfying outcomes . Because of the need for brevity here , the reader is referred to the excellent books dealing with creative dramatics , notably Creative Expression . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be modified to meet conditions as we find them in public schools , clubs , centers , and other forms of leisure-time education . The leader should participate more actively in introducing the idea of creative play production and play writing than may be necessary in an entirely free // school with small , intimate classes . The continuous contact of the pupils in a school situation favors such group enterprises as plays , festivals , and pageants . In the club and center , contact and interactions are not so continuous and so variegated and , therefore , not so conducive to the origination of group work of this nature . Dramatics is different from shopwork , pure art , or laboratory work . The latter appeal basically to the individual 's impulses to create and manipulate . Dramatics in clubs and in leisure-time education are the type of group enterprise that requires the leader 's cooperation to supply stability and continuity . Leader-function in dramatics is akin to that in a group discussion . ' In our own experimentation with creative dramatics in clubs , we found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure-time education is the festival and pageant of large groups , and parties and entertainments of individual clubs , or a combination of several such clubs . We were , in addition , successful also in stimulating play writing among boys and girls by an approach to be described later in this and subsequent chapters . Festivals and pageants ( not play contests ) are the most natural motivations for this work . The initiative for it should come from the various age-league councils for the purpose of celebrating holidays , special events , or a " league day . " Thus , the junior , intermediate , and senior leagues , or other such age subdivisions that may exist in a center , stimulate the separate clubs , individual members , and teams of two and three to present " numbers " at these affairs . In pageants , the co-operation of several or all the clubs of the league would be required . In schools , initiative may be taken by individual classes or by a committee representing classes of the same grade or age levels . Here dramatics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or they may be a product of the pupil 's creative phantasy and imagination . ( Seep . III . ) Festivals and pageants are as suitable for schools as they are for clubs and centers . The school , however , offers more possibilities for creative dramatics . Other traditional elements that educative dramatics must aim to eliminate are the imitative quality , excessive sophistication , and over-maturity . Good dramatic work of a creative // nature is simple and honest . Our records ( which can not be included in the present volume because of their length ) indicate that younger children 's original plays are simple , and that they grow sophisticated as the young authors come under the influence of commercial amusements . In some of our groups carried on creatively , impromptu skits , stunts , and improvised amusement forms occupied their complete attention on many occasions . In younger children , the creative spark is not fully extinguished . We found this spark lacking , however , among most boys and girls above eighteen . This recognition serves to emphasize the importance of creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages . It is particularly important for younger people . Aesthetic taste reflects environment and cultural background . Amusement standards are set by agencies that do not seek to foster the more cultured diversions . They are motivated entirely by profit . Taste can not be transmitted ; it evolves with inner development and refinement of the primitive drives . Direct attack upon bad taste is not effective ; it serves only to increase guilt feeling , and alienates the pupil from the teacher or leader . Tactics that repress primitive urges encourage surreptitious expression , or may even create neuroses . The approach must be one of raising aesthetic standards by reaching the unconscious through expression in many fields . Contact with inspiring individuals and refining experiences are effective . At the same time , the habitual idea as to what an entertainment constitutes must be gradually changed through indirect suggestion by the adult and by opening up new possibilities to his pupils . The first impulse on the part of young people is to copy the cheap theater , vaudeville , and movies ? the only things they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage attendance at performances of a more evolved nature . They can also gradually stimulate by indirect means originality and spontaneity . Original play writing is best suited for younger boys and girls because they are less self-conscious as to the effect upon the audience ; and the audience is less critical of them than it would be of older people . The value of play writing , in addition to many other obvious advantages , is that it involves a process of selecting material out of the vortex of life that // interests the writers , and that they consider as suitable for a play . These situations are dramatic and meaningful to the young authors . By combining these situations , adding characters and indicating relations between them , the writers learn not only play writing but also life itself . The suitable plot and action for a play is a situation that is directly related to the life of those who project it . Thus , at certain stages of the child 's development , plays of phantasy and imagination are appropriate , while heroic situations elicit response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for later adolescents and for adults . 4 The sources of plots are many : stories or school subject matter , such as history , that can be dramatized ; inventing sequences to stories and books that members have read ; recasting , changing , or expanding plays ; and , finally , devising original plots . Our own experience in schools and centers indicates that the greatest value from such work lies in group activity : i. e. , where the group evolve the plot , action , and serves to arouse greater enthusiasm ; it intensifies the sense of for presentation and adoption by the club . The group method serves to arouse greater enthusiasm ; it intensifies the sense of participation ; and the result is always richer and more complete . But perhaps the greatest advantage of this method over the committee or individual authorship is that it involves all members in the creative process ; they stimulate each other and live through a vital and meaningful group experience . The actual writing of the dialogue , however , has to be done by one or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boys and girls of eighteen to twenty , who were producing plays by other authors in the traditional manner , to original play writing may be of interest at this point . The leader of the group made the suggestion that such a policy might be adopted with advantage , and assured them that , although he would always be glad to be of help to them , they ought to plan to rely upon themselves entirely . A summary of the first discussion that followed the acceptance of the plan is given below : They decided that it was necessary : I. To decide upon the type of play they desired . DRAMATICS AND PLAY WRITING I2I 2 . To choose a .. o- ordinating " chairman , who should be responsible for the progress of the play ( through sub-committees if necessary ) , including scenery , costuming , make-up , etc. 3 . To get a secretary who should notify the group or sub-committees of progress being made , keep a record of progress , and handle any secretarial duties that might arise ( with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the regular secretary ) . They also decided that the group as a whole were to select the plot . There followed then a discussion between those who favored the selection of a type as against those who thought that the plot alone was important as an initial step . The decision was to select first not the plot but the situation . Also , the group were not to undertake an unproduceable situation or plot . Then the question arose as to what was the idea behind this whole enterprise . A lively discussion ensued , the outcome of which was that the aims were to write a play with a view to having the group do everything in connection with its production , including scenery building , costume designing and making , staging , and so forth . Then the question was raised as to whether the plot should be " real " or phantasy . The group thought that if it was not real , they would have a freer range . Others favored farce , and one suggested an " abstract " play . Two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the following meeting the group got together rather promptly , seated themselves around a table , and proceeded , in the absence of the leader , to discuss plans . Three of the members had their suggestions written out . One girl had about a dozen ideas . The secretary was taking rather copious minutes , and the discussion was lively . There was a good deal of very healthy thinking aloud ? something that the group situation stimulated ? and the final idea that was adopted was a product of this . Then a sudden inspiration came to the girl of the many ideas . Having heard the various suggestions from others , she now offered her proposal rather timidly , but the group was quick to grasp it and develop it into a fine plot . Among the themes suggested ( as shown by the secretary 's record ) were : a family problem of parents versus children ; // the private life of a famous man ; youth in the post-war era ; Grand Hotel theme ? people riding in the subway ; religious quandary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poe 's love life ; a social drama of today 's problems and propaganda ; an expansion of the themes in Arrowsmith and Backstreet ; young people and peace propaganda ; the depression strikes a well-to-do family of stage-struck children ; a timid poet falls in love with a girl who makes him write a great novel ; a week-end at a roadhouse ; a bashful Negro tries to propose to a Negress , with encouragement from her ; some one disturbs the past of a man ; expansion of a legend ; a teacher playing hookey ; an elderly man in quest of youthful experiences ; a Utopia for adolescents to discuss their problems . The last topic was accepted as the theme of the play . In one of the centers we circulated the idea that play writing is a desirable possibility for club work . ' This was first done through informal conversations with club leaders and members of senior clubs ; and occasionally in remarks during talks with younger boys and girls . Finally , a course of four meetings was offered for leaders and others interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being created , a number of groups were undertaking to try out the idea . One group of girls of fifteen to sixteen years were at a loss to find a plot . The leader asked one of the girls who expressed her dilemma : " What would you like to be when you grow up ? " " I 'd like to be a nurse . " " That is a good subject for a play . Let 's see what we can make of it . " The group of about twelve girls proceeded to suggest " the story , " which in its final form was something as follows : The poor girl has ambitions to become a nurse , but her family is so poor that she is compelled to do her preparatory work in an evening high school , while earning a living and helping maintain her family by working during the day . Finally she enters a hospital for her training , and falls in love with a struggling medical student , who also , because of poverty , must leave his home town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs are lower and where he earns part of his expenses by working evenings . In addition , the boy 's mother disapproves of her son 's interest in the student-nurse // ( " she is a mean , cranky old woman , who has only one son " ) and attempts to block the match in every way possible . The strain , overwork , and worry affect the girl 's eyesight ; but she keeps it from her superiors at the hospital and has her younger brother read to her the lessons , which she memorizes . Finally she graduates , and , in spite of her handicap , is able to earn enough money to help her lover financially . When he becomes a great doctor he performs a " miracle operation " and restores the health of her eyes . Then they get married . The plot was built up step by step , with numerous changes and additions , characters were added ( about ten in all ) , and individual scenes were planned in sequence . Several male actors were to be borrowed from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the results of this play , one of the members suggested that a " humorous play " be their next project . The girl said : " We moved today to another house , and I am tired . Let 's think of a funny play for next time . " The leader interjected : " I wonder if we can write a funny play around your moving . " " I think we can . We had some fun today , too . The expressman dropped a drawer from one of our dressers in the street , and all the things scattered . " " Can we build a play around this ? " asked the leader . The girls set to thinking , and a number of suggestions were forthcoming . The final story for a comedy was as follows : Four sisters , terribly excitable persons , are supervising the moving of a large family , the other members of which do not appear on the scene . They continually get in each other 's way ; they squabble and disagree and throw things over in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let things fly around the street , drop drawers and valises , which open up and scatter their contents . At last the things are moved to the new home , and the sisters again get into numerous squabbles about placing the furniture , hanging the curtains , and the like , until finally the house is settled with the sisters at swords ' points and completely exhausted . Then ( and this suggestion came from the girl who first proposed the play ) the janitor walks in and informs them that they moved to an apartment on the wrong floor . in many instances , however , young people offer resistance // to original play writing . Both teachers and leaders , as well as their charges , may view such an enterprise with considerable misgiving . They feel too inadequate for it . Creativity , however , can sometimes be superimposed upon a ready-made play as in the following instance of a first attempt at play writing : A club of boys , fourteen to fifteen years old , asked the leader to suggest to them titles of one-act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sponsored by their age-league council . The leader suggested a number of such titles , in the field of general social problems and comedy . At the following meeting some of the boys came in with a play , Little Heroes , by David Pinski . This play was not among those suggested , though another one by the same author was included in the leader 's list . The element that attracted them to the play most was an anti-war episode , with characters all of their own ages . They insisted that the leader read the play to them . They all commented that the play was good , though " some of the language and choice of words was not so good . " They agreed though , that as an anti-war play , it was n't so good as Peace on Earth , which they had seen as a group the week before . The leader suggested that if any of the language did not suit them , they might rewrite it in spots . This suggestion they accepted enthusiastically , and decided to adopt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated discussion arose as a result of the reconstruction of the play . Its ideology was attacked by some and defended by others . The defeatist attitude of the writer came under sharp criticism . They thought that the views expressed by the fourteen-year-old boy were " unintelligent . " They , the members of the club , " are educated as to how wars come about ; they know that the main trouble is with the higher-ups . " The leader then suggested that , if their own ideas clashed with those of the play , they could write them in . Two of the boys liked this suggestion , and came forward with ideas as to how the propaganda element might be introduced , still keeping the play the same as before . This , they thought , could be done by adding a character ? an older boy who would come on the stage near the end " and tell them what 's what . " Another suggestion was to eliminate the be  --  // ginning of the play , start with the middle , and write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original play . " But , " remarked one , " we 'll have a different play altogether ! " And that idea proved abhorrent . The leader attempted gently to take them along the steps of writing a play of their own interests and ideas . The boys balked at the thought of writing something new when they already had tangible plans at hand . They then proceeded to justify this stand by saying that " a play should only entertain , not have too much propaganda , anyway . " It should not teach too much . Furthermore , some argued , boys and girls of their ages would not understand propaganda . They finally decided that all they might do was to produce the play as it was , with slight modifications in language . 5 Of no small educative significance in creative dramatics are the various manual and art activities that enter into its complex . The members of the **27;396;TOOLONG group to which reference has already been made at once saw such possibilities when the question of original play writing came up . Hitherto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , who were paid out of the proceeds of the plays . When the plan for creative dramatics was being contemplated , among the first possibilities that came to their minds were costuming , lighting , scenery construction , painting , and stage setting . The prospect of this manual-creative work seemed to elicit more enthusiasm than the play writing itself , and the very first meeting saw the birth of a stagecraft group . An interesting sidelight of this development was that the girls of the group responded more warmly to this aspect of play production than did the boys , and , in addition to the costuming and scenery painting , actually worked with tools in scenery construction . As already suggested , creative dramatics is in a real sense a confluence of many constructional , art , literary , and intellectual skills . Here the plastic arts , mechanical prowess , manual dexterity , and , in some instances , music , the dance , and singing are integrated . To this must be added also literary expression , voice culture , posture , discussion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfconsciousness , power of identification , ability in group action , 1 26 CREATIVE GROUP EDUCATION and emotional release attained through creative expression in the various media involved . Dramatics , as described here , provides opportunities for individual members to work in their favorite fields in a group situation , which , as already stated , is of great educative value . Our records of creative dramatics ( especially play writing ) indicate that valuable interchange of ideas arose not only in matters of play construction , but also on subjects of general cultural interest : psychology , logic of behavior , human motives , social setting , individual responses to external conditions , mental " quirks , " relations between parents and children and between boys and girls , and numerous other such topics . It is quite evident that the motivations supplied by an activity that stimulates the desire to discover meanings and significances in the life around and within is of immeasurable value . Although play writing and play production on this plan may not conform with professional mores and efficiency techniques , it does become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native action-interests , manipulative and reflective drives , and group action : it appeals to all areas of the personality . It is in complete conformity with creative education for an adult to undertake to put a play written by young people into a form that will give them the greatest satisfaction . To assure this satisfaction , it may be necessary for him to put the " final touches " to the play . He may also actively help in the production itself . This procedure must not be confounded with that in which the adult assumes the directorial and managerial role in advance of the original creative procedure , and thus limits the inner experience of the group . CHAPTER X CREATIVE WRITING Writing as a form of original expression is comparatively new in education . Literature was something pupils were required to absorb , analyze , and " appreciate " under the direction and instruction of a master . Poetry was rhymes to be memorized and recited in class , with proper cadence and intonation . The more dramatic and sing-song the rendition , the more retentive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarter 's report card . In recent years , however , and particularly as a result of the efforts of progressive schools , literary expression has been established as a valuable and highly educational means for personality development . creative writing grows naturally out of a vital and stimulating school life . It can not be stimulated directly in an atmosphere of strict formalism and rigidity . The flow of emotion and thought that culminates in literary expression is a by-product of released power and feeling . It can not be forced ; it can not be cajoled or even " encouraged " directly . Word formulation and expression can be released only through a friendly and hospitable atmosphere , and fed by spiritual enrichment and aesthetic experience . The needs of these are derived from experiencing good literature , the arts , great thoughts , and stimulating persons . Creativity through words is impossible in an environment of spiritual and intellectual impoverishment . Expansiveness and release of thought and emotion need understanding and encouragement from adults , and only those adults who are capable of this understanding can expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of creativity . It must be noted that , in other arts , motivation for expression is partly supplied by the materials involved in the art itself ; but in literature there are no palpable external stimuli . For this reason , perhaps , literary expression is less widespread among school children than the arts involving manual work and materials would be , with equal opportunities . In addition , it must be recognized that language imagery and a language sense arc among specific talents . These talents 127 // are more highly evolved because they utilize abstractions only , and are , therefore , rarer than those talents that spring from more biologic sources , such as the manipulative arts . Although children 's literary expression draws upon a rich emotional , intellectual , and aesthetic life , there are specific means by which this expression can be stimulated . Chief among these are creative dramatics of various forms , class or club publications , school or center organs , authors ' literary evenings , and special writers ' groups . It must be emphasized that special classes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intention of this work . As already indicated , literary creativity can not be taught . It is rather a result of favorable conditions and background . Like all other arts , creative writing seeks to fulfil the needs of the personality . Problems , conflicts , strivings , joy , and sadness form the content and the intention of these efforts . Day dreams , unconscious longing , and emotional responsiveness find their outlet and fulfilment in words as exemplified in the following selections : By a boy nine years old : // I love the lilacs . Their leaves are like hearts ; When I go near the lilac bush , They bow to me , And I bow to them . By a girl nine years old : THE SWING Brother , push me into the sky . I love to see the bright stars . When I see them , I feel happy . But if I could be hung From the end of the moon , I would rock in the sky And be happy always . . // By a boy twelve years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It shines on everything ! It makes me feel happy when I go to work . I set up pins in a bowling alley Till very late , when I get so tired I want to throw the pins after the men . When I come out into the moonlight , I hate everything ! By a girl nine years old : THE MOON* I know the moon is my friend ; Bright and clear it shines ; It never makes you fear at night , Like other things . I dreamed , and the moon Came up to my room and my bed And washed my face with light . By a boy fifteen years old : WHAT WOULD I BE IF I WERE N'T ME ? Oh , what would I be if I were n't me ? It is such a distressing mystery . Would I be an elephant with a trunk so long ? Or would I be a robin always singing a song ? Would I be a monkey so full of fleas ? A monkey that swings through the branches of trees ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hiding to capture its prey ? Maybe I 'd be a poodle with my fur all white , Or perhaps a hoot owl , that hoots through the night . Would I be the north wind so careless and free ? Oh , what would I be if I were n't me ? I could be the rhinoceros so very big . I could he a porcupine or maybe a pig . But still there 's the hear that loves honey and jam . " fell me , what would I be if I were n't what I am ? // Often it is purely rhythmic music that youngsters seek to express in their writings . This is especially true of young children . Listen to this song : By a boy eleven years old : IN THE GARDEN* " In the garden , " said the robin , " In the garden , " said the robin , " In the garden , " said the robin , I saw a dance last night , In honor of a fairy , In honor of a fairy , In honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There came the breath of Spring , There came the breath of Spring , There came the breath of Spring , And kissed her on the cheek . She danced and skipped so prettily , She danced and skipped so prettily , She danced and skipped so prettily , And then she bowed to Spring . And every step she took , A little bud popped out , A little bud popped out . Satire also finds expression in their writing . By a boy fifteen years old : THE WORLD THAT IS TO BE 1 . I had a dream , a wondrous dream ; And if you 'll list to me , I 'll tell you of the dream I had Of the world that is to be . 2 . There were airplanes and flying trains Roaming through the sky , A rocket ship hack from a trip Landed on a skyscraper high . // 3 ? Electric cars that rode to Mars On cables of invisible steel Sped at a rate that was greater than great , And the thrill was a grand thing to feel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back Was the simplest thing to do . A transport great , like a flying estate , Had a captain and a robot crew . 5 ? Submarines viewed the beautiful scenes To be seen beneath the sea , People rode on a chair that floated through air And defied gravity . 6 . Synthetic food that melted when chewed Was made by a mechanical chef . In one little pill you could get your fill If ever a pill was left . 7 . But then I awoke . Do n't think it a joke ; If you live long enough you will see The things I dreamt about , without a doubt , In the world that is to be . Perhaps the following poem , written by a girl 12.7 years old , illustrates more than any of the others how a rich cultural background can culminate in creative writing : // Nothing blue , nothing green , Everything a swirling whirling mass ; Crashing , falling , thundering , flames piercing through rock and gorge ; A falling , whizzing sound , a settling thud ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A heat that penetrates the most staunch barricades . // Then night ? what is night ? Darkness , blackness , silence . A glow , a warm , warm glow , A sphere of red and yellow light ; Stars , moons , planets , Circling , swerving , twirling ; Clouds passing , Shape of animals , seas , spirals , vast mountains . Now after ? wetness . Cells , single cells lonely slowly rocking ? floating ; They multiply , divide , Swim side by side , Crawling , sprawling , falling ; Now plants , trees , vines that twine and climb ; And after centuries and centuries of development , Dinosaurs , Beasts whose hinds and fores could reach for miles and miles : They swam and played and talked through generations . After eons of changing , these huge vertebrates were gone Never more to return ? extinct . Out of this came Man . But creative writing is not confined to poetry . Often the young authors wax philosophical and polemic , and their writings are imbued with a strong social conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy of fourteen : " Life is like a bud . If surrounding conditions do not warrant its growth it becomes tainted and withers ; if , however , conditions are favorable , it bursts and blooms forth full-winged , like a butterfly from its chrysalis . " From a club paper of boys sixteen to eighteen years old . DEDICATION " We dedicate this paper to the man who is willing to work , who can work , but who has no work . " We dedicate this paper to the day when there will be that social system which will not tolerate in a land of plenty such starvation , such privation , such conditions , as we now have about us . " We dedicate this paper to the thought that the forgotten man of today will he hut history tomorrow . " We dedicate this paper to the hope that these ideas will not remain just a dedication . " // The two papers that follow formed a part of a controversy on competition in sports that was carried on in one of the centers referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about seventeen years old , had no special educational advantages . Like all of the other children , except one , whose works are quoted in this chapter , they came from poor homes and congested neighborhoods , and had only ordinary schooling . We feel that it was the nature of the controversy , the stimulation from good leadership , and prolonged thought and discussion that are responsible for the quality of ideas and writing exemplified in these papers . The papers follow : " Happiness is the main goal of life , and it can not be achieved through a competitive scheme of living . We have seen what the result of competition in the world to date has brought forth : a low standard of living and starvation , the financial standing of the trading world at the lowest standard it has ever been ; wars , because of the imperialistic tendencies as shown by the world in 1914 and Japan today . We know that , since the world began , life has been a destiny of competitive reactions ; but because of its civilized failure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more life to those under this system that will eradicate the filth and inhumanity which at present bedeck the field of competition . Non-competition will stimulate the real purpose of living . The real beauty of life , with all its wonderful virtues and character , can become full-hearted practice in a non-competitive mode of living . The United States government today is trying to regulate the competitive trade system . The N.R.A . endeavors to control the industries in the price of commodities and the paying of a living wage . Thus , you can plainly perceive the close scrutiny the government is using in the curbing of outgrowths of competition . The House is a little world in itself , but the members of the House must realize that they are also individuals of a larger world . Since the young people in the House are being taught in a program which will aid them in their contacts with the outside world , they must be given a real foundation for their future . A settlement house is not for the purpose of gaining glory in producing champions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an educational institution where the youngsters can all be given a winning spirit ; an equal right to recreational privileges is what we should have and not the wholesale sacrifice of fairness and squareness ' to the do or die ' spirit . " " There is a joy in struggle , a pleasure in the tussle that is the // very marrow of life . It is our heritage from primitive man . He had to struggle to exist ; we must compete to live . The individual glories when his body meets the body of his foe : he is living . His blood is free with the flow of life . It is so when he seeks a mate . Our ancestor , when he courted , brought fine offerings to the parent . He had to roam the woods in search of the more dangerous animals in order to be worthy of the female 's notice . He who offered best , won . Therefore , the male pitted his skill against that of his neighbor 's . It was the beginning of competition . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat off the disgruntled suitors . But he gloried in combat . It was the survival of the fittest . Now , our offerings are ourselves . We offer our personalities and prospects against those of our neighbors . It is combat , just as then , but our civilized language terms it competition . Then the fittest was the strongest ; now it is the cleverest , the fellow with the most direct personal appeal . There is only a change in the means ; the instinct is the same . But marriage does not end the battle . The ancestor had to protect and keep his mate . Always , he had to beat off other males , desirous of mates . He did n't know the meaning of growing things . He had to hunt to eat . He had to contend with the beast . His brain against brawn ; competition , the great game of life . Now , the husband has to hunt also . Jobs are as scarce as food was then , perhaps more so . We have to contend with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fuel of life . The settlement is the training ground for the game . Its children are the men of the future . They must be vaccinated to the hardships of the tussle . Therefore , we have competitive sports ? basketball , baseball , and the others . The training of the youth is necessary or the man will be bewildered . Manhood is too late for us to adapt ourselves . That is why we pit ourselves against each other in contests and games . And the youngster loves it , because it meets the throb of his heart . He feels the joy of the struggle . He glories in being alive . " CHAPTER XI NATURE STUDY AND SCIENCE I Although emphasis upon art and other less intellectual pursuits is compatible with the psychology of childhood , the reflective and intellectual interests that gradually make their appearance as the child grows older must also find expression in a complete education . Just as it is inadvisable to plan the program ahead of the intellectual interests in children , it is equally deleterious to check those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures , debates , creative writing , and dramatics offer opportunities for intellectual effort . But it must be noted that the content of these is largely abstract . Although learning is an inevitable concomitant of all activity , science is one of the few subjects that engages simultaneously the biologic drives of pursuit , discovery , and curiosity , and at the same time offers possibilities for learning and acquiring information . The human body ( as well as the bodies of lower animals ) is organized for pursuit because survival depends upon it . The nature and development of culture reveals the same characteristics on the psychological plane , and the behavior of children confirms the existence of this pursuit tendency . This tendency , because of its basic nature , must be one of the foundations of a naturalistic education . Science , being chiefly a pursuit subject and one that whets natural curiosity , offers important possibilities for character education . But in order that it may serve these ends , it must conform with the discovery drives and be initiated by the pupil rather than consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is derived from discovery . In addition , discovery begets power and greater control over environment . It also makes a very strong appeal to the ego , and increases self-esteem . The acquisition of all knowledge should , therefore , occur through original discovery on the part of the learner , even if it is only re-discovery from the point of view of existing knowledge . Obviously , no one 135 // person can discover for himself the entire content of information and knowledge that modern complex life requires . The beginnings of all learning , however , should be discovery . It must also be brought home to the learner through story and biography that all knowledge originates from past discoveries of workers and thinkers that became incorporated into the intellectual store of the race . Science , being characteristically a discovery subject , is most suitable for the purpose implied in this thesis . ' It must not , however , be assumed that the discovery process is confined to science . It occurs in all free activity , manual and intellectual . The search attitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discerned this underlying motive throughout this volume . It is applied to discussion , to shop work , to the arts , to dramatics , and to creative literature . The content of the discoveries of these various forms may vary , but the underlying motivation and process are identical in them all . A great deal of consideration has already been given in this volume to the manipulative interests of children and young people and to their value to character building . It will , therefore , receive only mention here in so far as it can find expression through science in schools , in centers , and in leisure-time education . The ordinary science laboratory procedure offers a considerable field for manipulation and acquisition of skill , but here manual work and inventiveness are subordinated , if not altogether negated , by the purpose and objectives set by the instruction sheets . In a science workroom in which exploration is the aim , inventiveness and search become the focal means as well as the objectives . A science workroom in informal education can , therefore , serve its aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and group play . Serious investigation and research arise from this earlier play-activity as the child grows older . In an education the aim of which is character training , innate and universal fear tendencies in children will receive major consideration . It is obviously impossible to discuss this most important subject at great length here , but any treatise on character education would be inadequate and incomplete without mention of it . The subject of fear and phobias is a // distinct province of psychiatry . Everyday manifestations of fear , however , become unalterably entwined into the human make-up . They may be passed unobserved , but nevertheless they strongly affect personality and behavior . The dispersion of fear can not be assigned as belonging to any one area of education or experience . It occurs continuously and slowly throughout the life of the child . Security derived from adults and increased familiarity with the world and with the processes of normal living are among the factors that aid in this procedure . Timidity , insecurity , apprehension , and other forms in which fear may manifest itself are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful solution of problems , by overcoming of difficulties , and through achievement . In a sense , therefore , fear is dissipated by personalityintegrating experience , but it is particularly aided by scientific knowledge and the scientific process . Science content extends the frontiers of knowledge , and fear flees before familiarity . In the second place , the procedure of acquiring this knowledge , advocated by the present writer for all education and especially for science , known as the " Search-Discovery Method , " calls forth power and self-reliance. 2 In a discussion of character , the question of the basic cruelty of man must also be considered . The problems that arise from it in individual and social relations are too far reaching to be neglected . They must be faced squarely by all true educators ; for only through such a realistic approach can effective means be devised to divert native cruelty into socially useful patterns . At the present time , " humanizing " the growing child is attempted by one of three methods : ( 1 ) preaching the blessings and virtue of kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the victims of the child 's cruelty ; and ( 3 ) scolding and punishing the offenders , which only negates and cancels the intention . In the present writer 's analysis of these techniques elsewhere he indicated that : " Preaching is seldom effective as a solvent of emotional compulsions . . . . Words have little effect where basic drives are involved . . . . Neither preaching nor feigned sympathy by 13 8 CREATIVE GROUP EDUCATION adults can arouse those mental qualities that are essential to true sympathy . There must occur some emotional re-sublimation of the primitive , animal cruelty tendencies , through some basic and subjective experiences . Surely , these experiences are not supplied by beating and scolding . If any results can at all be expected from such treatment , they are resentment and further intensified cruelty . " ' No ascertainable knowledge exists at the present time as to the inner process that transforms the cruelty impulses of the infant into " fairly human " attitudes and feelings of the adult . ' The concept of " sublimation " is at best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs when a tendency is transformed into its opposite extreme . One writer4 found in her work with young children that a scientific study of animals ( chiefly dissection of corpses ) " did actually achieve a steady humane outlook and enliven the children 's sense of responsibility toward their pets and toward animals in general . " The present writer in his work with children has also found that children 's cruelty to animals is lessened or disappears upon prolonged acquaintance with them . Dr. Isaacs ' suggestion and our own findings that the primitive power and cruelty drives of children can be converted into knowledge are of immense importance to character education . It is not at all impossible that the aggressiveness that arises from cruelty can be re-directed into search for knowledge and other activity growing out of curiosity . This method may be a means for humanizing the human race . Science education that includes ' biological materials , care and study of animals , and some elements of psychology should , therefore , be a part of a good home , school and leisure time education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inestimable . At some stages of the child 's development , experience with these is necessary for his integration . The aesthetic appreciation derived from contact with colorful plants and the emotions set up by cuddling , petting , stroking , and loving responses to animals not only make a strong appeal , but are also essential to the child 's full development as a personality . // 3 A science room that aims at character education as well as fact-learning is equipped on the general principles of the arts and crafts workshop and the art room . The work benches and the home-made laboratory tables are placed around the walls , and ( if necessary ) also in the middle of the room , but in such positions as to allow space for unhampered movement and communication . The furnishings and materials are very simple , devoid of the forbidding unfamiliarity of the ordinary laboratory equipment . The equipment may consist , in fact , mostly of discarded tables , chairs , shelves , etc . It is most valuable if the boys and girls take part in furnishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is done , the members bring many odd objects from their homes suitable for a " tinker science workroom . " Old sauce pans , pots , spoons , toy engines , mechanical toys , old clocks , old bells and electric cells , radio sets , rolls of film , tools , bicycle pumps , wheels , chemcraft sets , scales , candles , electric bulbs , sockets , switches , and numerous such objects make their appearance . In an exploratory-science playroom such as we recommend , all odd pieces are usable . They either suggest activity or fit into some mechanical construction or scientific investigation . In Science in the New Education we have given a very detailed description of the layout and arrangement of such a room , including sketches and drawings . Lists of suitable materials and books are also included . Because of lack of space , it is not possible to detail these here , but the general principles governing them will be indicated . All materials must be suggestive of activity rather than of didactic learning and teaching . Mechanical and electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to view . All materials and equipment must be so simple as to reduce adult participation in the work to a minimum . It must be kept in mind throughout that the real purpose of the " science tinker shop " is not rote learning , but discovery through activity . If materials and apparatus are not sufficiently simple , they do not induce self-activity . It is also needless to say that no specified outlines or plan of procedure should be used , though books for reference and for suggesting experiments ought to be a part of the room equipment . These // are most useful to expand the horizon of the young workers on the basis of preceding activity , but they should not be used as texts or laboratory sheets in the accepted sense . Simplicity can be achieved by substituting for standard equipment objects of everyday use . Frying pans , saucepans , and tumblers can be used instead of beakers ; milk bottles and fruit jars can take the place of flasks in simple work , and a bicycle pump is a good substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , essential for boys . Simple machines also have a great attraction for them . It is desirable that opportunities be created for young boys and girls to work experimentally , with simple chemicals , particularly with those that produce spectacular effects . Wonder interests precede knowledge interests in mental development . Enlightened education , for that reason , fosters the play impulse of children and their dramatic predilections in science as well as in other subjects . The latter , the dramatic factor , is essential to focus attention necessary for learning . It is not necessary to list in detail activities suitable for such an approach , or materials . ' Since it is not intended to give a prepared course in science , but rather to exploit the exploratory , pursuit , manipulative , and creative tendencies for the ends of personality development and character training , the method is important . The suitable method is one of pupil-initiation and pupil selfactivity , discovery , and invention . All details and techniques should be subordinated to these . The leader 's or teacher 's participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stimulate interest in the work , if for any reason such an interest does not spontaneously arise , and then withdraw , leaving the field to the pupils ; ( 2 ) to work with the pupils when they desire his help or when they approach a point of discouragement or a dilemma . 4 In the maze of experiences that make up the formal and informal education of the growing personality , a feelingrelationship with nature is a supreme necessity . Native impulses of man , as a heritage of earlier life and environment , are directed toward the expanse of the fields and forests , the . // setting and coloring of the sun , and the sky line . Personality education , even in large congested cities , can not be effective unless some means are evolved to give expression and to develop that phase of child nature . Official education overemphasizes the intellect at the cost of the emotional-aesthetic expansion . An evolved personality has these multifarious phases balanced : his emotional-aesthetic and intellectual-rational responses are equally developed . This result is the general objective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art , music , singing , the dance , creative literature , poetry , dramatics , and arts and crafts are balanced against discussion , research , and science . But none of these can take the place of experience with nature : plants and animals . In the volume on science education already referred to , it was shown that the impulses to play and work with plants and animals are not truly scientific . They were shown to be rather love and beauty interests . Nevertheless , " the fact that animals and plants are not appropriate for children 's scientific interests should not militate against them as most important educative influences . The child 's development must occur in all aspects of his personality . He needs to experience the aesthetic delights of flowers , and the affectionate relationships with animals , as well as whatever manipulative-exploratory activities they offer . As a matter of fact , in certain stages of his development these are of far more importance to the child than strictly scientific learnings. " s In addition to nature trips ( which will be discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a room with simple animals , such as puppies , kittens , white mice and rats , chicks , canaries , bunnies , frogs , turtles , and snakes ; an aquarium with fish , snails , and salamanders ; and also some plants , including flowers , flower pots , planting trays , soil , humus , seeds , and glass plates for planting and studying growth and germination . Children should be able to come into this room for quiet ( and this may have to be made compulsory ) play with animals , watching and observing , feeding and caring for them , supervising mating and helping care for the young ; planting flowers and garden truck in pots and trays , observing their growth , watering them and performing scientific tests and studies of germination , // photosynthesis , and heliotropism . We do not know of any centers for leisure-time education where such work is carried on in the spirit described here , but those progressive private schools where this work has been tried attest to its richness of results and possibilities . Serious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discussion and consideration among the children and between the teachers and children . The children gradually learn to view with ease and objectivity those body functions that are usually charged with emotionalism , fear , aversion , and taboo . 5 Science interests become dominant among older boys in clubs conducted on an activity plan . We found that most adolescent boys respond readily to science facts , and enjoy keeping a club science scrap book . Discussions on science also become an absorbing part of the program . As boys and girls grow older and reach the pre-adult stage , the purely ideational and reflectional interests appear to have vital meanings to them . At this stage , the preparatory work of experimental and activity science interests are transformed into philosophical and theoretical meanings . These can become , under skilful guidance , sources of social and personal orientation and an aid in the emergence of a philosophy of life . One of the results to which science education , formal or informal , lends itself admirably is an enlightened understanding of and a progressive attitude toward the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present , based as it is upon scientific achievement on the one hand and the serious , almost insurmountable socio-economic problems that it brought in its wake on the other , the need for social enlightenment and intellectual hospitality is imperative . Science , because it attempts to be objective in its method and content , can aid greatly in the development of values and attitudes that permit of impersonal and disinterested evaluation of world affairs . A word of warning may be needed here , however , for there is a tendency to invest organized science with potencies that it does not really possess . The solutions to the larger problems of life lie in truths that are not within the scope of science ; they transcend logic and epistemology . These solutions are rooted in unrestricted thinking based upon reNATURE // sponsiveness to the subtle forces and the natural needs of man 's spirit . Social feelings and responsibilities divested of infantile ambitions and power-drives are greatly needed . We need greater maturity of the personality as a whole ? and balance ; we need a reconstructed world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's minds open and receptive , discriminative and discerning , with the power to recognize the effectual from the futile . Mechanistic science with its exactitude and certainties is a source of great security to man , who is at a loss to grasp the meaning of life and of existence . Because of the security it offers , it tends to captivate the mind ; but at the same time limits its exploratory inclusiveness . Science education must , from its very outset , impress the learner with its eternal tentativeness , with its limitations as a directive of life . Science teachers must keep the portals of the mind wide open for other knowledges and other impressions , and to help fuse these all into an integrated whole as a guide to living . It is in these aspects that science holds promise to character education . The questions of origins , birth , sex , and biologic adjustment to environment come naturally into purview out of research in a child-centered laboratory . Animals that die are dissected . ' Charts of the human body as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth questions on human physiology , ' health , and hygiene . This is a natural way of introducing such topics . The lecture method employed in schools , with unwilling listeners , deadens even vital information . This method does not arouse active curiosity . It employs abstract concepts , and it forces learning . As in all other activity , scope and content in science exploration are predicated by the age and backgrounds of those participating in it . Prolonged experience with this activity type of science learning in private progressive schools indicates that science workrooms and biological and nature-study rooms such as those suggested here not only serve best the ends of learning subject matter but also contribute considerably to character education . // 6 The reader will find in the next chapter a fuller treatment of trips as an educational device . In this section , only those trips that bear upon the extension of science interests and knowledge will be considered . As the pupils of a school or club members of a center grow older , they require progressively more complex experiences and wider understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discussions , reading , book researches , and trips serve these new needs more fully . Instrumental or applied science is more dramatic than the pure mathematical or descriptive sciences ; it readily attracts interest and attention of young people . Visits to industrial plants and other centers , the work of which is based upon scientific principles and discoveries , are therefore suitable for the purpose suggested . Industrial plants of various kinds within easy access , hospital laboratories , board of health laboratories , crime detection bureaus , hospitals for mental cases , and sanitary and health departments of municipal and private institutions should be included in the itinerary of these visits . School and neighborhood centers should supply lists of such points of scientific interest in the community to their classes and groups . Nature walks and nature trips , to be of most educational value , should not be mapped and planned minutely in advance , as is usually done . Rather , they should be taken for the mere joy and peace that comes from being in the open , from the green spaces , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young people ought to be able to sit quietly and serenely under a tree and become one with the peace and quiet of their surroundings . They ought to be able to develop an appreciation of the color and sound harmonies of the forest and of the expansiveness of the sunfilled plains . Such responsiveness is an outgrowth of general development and of habit . It can not be taught directly or brought about by compulsion or preachment . Ordinarily , however , " hikes " mean only strenuous life outdoors : strenuous walking , making a fire , cooking , playing strenuous games ( chiefly competitive ) , learning to identify trees , flowers , and birds all obvious and rationalistic occupations . Although some of these have their place in outdoor life and are necesNATURE // sary , they should not constitute the complete outdoor program . At least part of the time should be spent in appreciative silence and responsiveness to the quiet and beauty of the countryside .. In actual experience it was found that numerous questions suggest themselves to the members ? numerous wondermanifestations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fore . Questions about insects , birds , stones , flowers , land formation , plants and planets ? the whole gamut of the sciences ? come to attention . The knowledge thus acquired is informal , unorganized , but real and vital . We give , only as an indication of the possibilities , a condensed description of a first trip of this nature held in the spring : " With eleven boys we were off at 2:30 P. M. to discover the wilds and mysteries of the Bronx Zoological Gardens . " On the train going up there was , of course , the usual kidding around and cheerful chatter that always takes place among a group of boys off on a trip . And , as always , the bigger boys in the group began telling the one little fellow that he must be careful when he goes in the monkey house , to stay with the group , because they knew of another little fellow who wandered from his group and got left in the zoo , and now that poor little boy is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to stimulate any questions by putting questions to the boys , since I felt that , to get the true reaction , it would be best to let all the questioning and remarks come from them entirely unaided . " The reptile house seemed to attract the most interest . Once inside , the boys all clamored to know which were the poisonous and which the non-poisonous snakes . It seems that these reptiles hold a certain fascination for boys of this age group . Here I had a chance to explain to them something of the characteristics of reptiles , and how one could tell a poisonous snake from a non-poisonous one . They all seemed rather curious to know how one could tell an alligator from a crocodile . I pointed out the distinguishing features , the differences in the snouts , and so on . They were all somewhat amazed to learn that turtles were reptiles , in the same class with snakes . " Two boys became fascinated by the lions , and stood there watching one cage for quite some time . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , they remained there and furnished us with a little excitement . When we checked up , these two were missing , // and we had to send out a searching party for them . And sure enough , as I suspected , there they were , still watching the lions . " One development of note was the interest in rocks and minerals aroused by one boy 's knowledge of the subject . As we were walking along the path , this boy picked up a piece of rock and called out , Look , here 's some mica schist . ' The rest of the boys immediately gathered around and wanted to know how this boy knew it was mica schist , and what mica schist was , anyhow . The boy explained that he belonged to a nature group at school and at camp , and had been taught to distinguish the different rocks and minerals . Immediately one boy asked , Well , I thought all rocks are rocks . What is the difference between rocks and minerals ? And how can you tell the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about rocks ) took it upon himself to do the explaining ; and he displayed a rather fair knowledge of the subject . Two of the boys decided to take home some specimens . " CHAPTER XII TRIPS AND EXCURSIONS I The values of trips in school and club work are : ( I ) to give outlet to the travel urge universal in children ; ( 2 ) to supply variety of experience ; ( 3 ) to widen contact with reality ; ( 4 ) to give opportunity for exploring , investigating , and discovering environment ; ( 5 ) to stimulate discussion and activity ; ( 6 ) to amplify and extend studies , activities , and discussions ; ( 7 ) to increase free contact among the pupils or club members with one another and with the leader or teacher ; and ( 8 ) to develop self-reliance through solving problems that arise during trips . In schools additional values in trips are derived from ( 9 ) enriching courses and ( 1o ) relieving the confinement and monotony of the classroom . The value of trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without rigid supervision , getting acquainted with various industrial and social processes , and widening comprehension of the world . The profit from trips often depends upon the guides assigned to conduct the group through plants and institutions as well as on the group leader in charge . If the leader is conscious of the group 's interest and the extent of their understanding , he can , by carefully questioning the guide , elicit suitable information and pave the way for the children 's questions . He may tactfully check the guide from " pouring out " information that is meaningless or too complicated for children . Additional educational value can be gained from trips if the class or club program is built around them . Members participating in trips may desire to report on and discuss what they had seen . Such reports may suggest discussion , study , and investigation . They also offer opportunities for practice in expression and organization of thought . The complexity of the content of such discussion and activity will be naturally determined by the age and background of the group members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate if they can go about railroad yards and docks and observe the activity there without any further 147 // study . They may be interested in starting a group scrap-book with pictures of various types of vehicles from earliest times to the present . They may want to tell or hear stories as to how improvements in these devices were first made . Dramatic incidents in the lives of inventors who aided these developments usually prove fascinating . It is almost certain that such a project will stimulate some to draw models . Others may try to make replicas out of wood , plasticine , or clay or out of other materials . Films dealing with the subject of transportation , easily obtained from museums and commercial concerns , will help amplify the subject . Exhibits to which parents , friends , and other groups are invited as guests will prove an excellent incentive for such work . Older boys , who have passed the manipulative and constructional phases of their development , may be interested in these subjects as mechanical and scientific phenomena . They will , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads , airplanes , and steamships . They will bring the latest scientific data from magazines and newspapers , and give talks about them . All this is valuable experience in a program of personality development . It stimulates interest-activity and power to formulate , express , and communicate ideas ; and sets off common group interests . Young men and women can be interested in more involved aspects of transportation . A trip to a railroad or a steamship can be the starting point for a study of the evolution of transportation , social and cultural implication of improved travel , intellectual achievements of man incorporated in and expressed through these facilities . The influence of transportation upon the world scene ; its effect upon " world-mindedness " as compared with " country-mindedness " ; the economic effects of transportation ; its influence upon culture , language , diet , customs , dress , etc. ; the psychological need of man for transportation and for communication generally ; man as a communicative animal ; the relation of communication to culture and civilization ? these are among the subjects that come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discussion that contact through communication was expected to 1 ) ring the world into a closer unity , but that instead the countries of the world seem to be growing more nationalistic and chauvinistic. // What has been said here of transportation is equally true of all other trips . Every industry has its history ? a record of its development and the influence it exerted upon civilization and progress . A visit to a mill , for example , has possibilities for inaugurating a study of the basic animal needs with special reference to man ; his entire orientation to the world for the satisfaction of these needs ; primitive methods of obtaining food , shelter and clothing ; scientific , cultural , and industrial developments which led to modern production of food ; the changing status of woman as a result of a mechanized world and home ; increased leisure and mechanization ; the use of leisure ; the creative impulse and leisure ; and the numberless other avenues which such discussions may take . What has been said of the manual activities that may develop from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect also true here . 2 Up to now we have discussed group activity as it may originate from trips . This relation may be reversed , however . Trips may be planned because of a need to illustrate , to amplify , or to extend the work of a club or class . The work of groups of all ages in schools and leisure-time education offers numerous possibilities in this direction if the leader or teacher is disposed to utilize them . An **29;425;TOOLONG group of boys were discussing art on the basis of a paper read by one of the members . They considered the various forms of art expression ; the possibilities of various media for translating of emotion ; the relative suitability for conveying different moods in different media ; the function of art in society ; its value as a social force ; the controversy between the Rockefeller Center and Diego Rivera ; the Municipal Art Exhibit , etc . There was a live and informed interest in the subject displayed by five or six of the boys . This particular club , however , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was abruptly terminated by the leader that evening . Obviously , the leader had missed here an opportunity for a valuable cultural experience . It is such incidental opportunities , properly utilized , that make up an effective education . There was interest , receptivity , and even enthusiasm on the part of // some of the members for the subject . These conditions are most favorable for learning . ( I ) The group might have called in artists who could answer many of the questions informatively and meaningfully ; ( 2 ) they might have visited artists ' studios to see their work and become acquainted with creative people ; ( 3 ) they could have visited the municipal art exhibit which they talked about ; or ( 4 ) they could have gone to view the Diego Rivera murals . In our outline of a model activity program , we recommended trips and excursions as a means of amplifying group activity ( see p. 6o ) . It was stated that " the purpose of these trips is to widen the intellectual horizon of the boys , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the processes involved in modern living . " It was also asserted that trips as points of departure for club ( and class ) discussions and activities can be used " effectively in such a variety of ways that it would be difficult to set them down briefly . " Trips , like all other activities , should correspond to the interests of the group as a whole , and sometimes even to the preferences of individual members . The art discussion just described is an illustration in point . In a similar way , a group interested in a discussion of the judiciary system , for example , would welcome a speaker on law . They would find it profitable to visit courts dealing with matters suitable to the age of the members . Group interests may make necessary trips dealing with science or various city and state governmental agencies , such as the police academy , the fire department , the various laboratories , and the health department . Private social agencies , labor-union offices , employers ' association offices , arbitration and compensation courts would be of immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in social studies or in discussing social problems . Groups engaged in a discussion of religion ( usually a popular topic ) might invite speakers on different religions and arrange trips to places of worship . As the members grow older and their ability to appreciate the arts has been extended by the home , the school , and neighborhood center , trips to various museums , concerts , the opera , exhibits , dance recitals , and other forms of art expression become appropriate . ' // 3 Some writers hold that there must be " solid preparation " for a trip , and that the things to be observed should be carefully outlined and described by the teacher in advance . The pupils , it is said , should be in a state of anticipation and in suspense . They must have " anticipatory interests . " These writers warn us that the most interesting is not necessarily the most important . It is important , they say , that students do not overstress the most arresting and novel , but that they rather observe what is considered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as confirmatory trips ; their real function is to confirm what is already known . In contradistinction to these are the trips in which stress is laid upon the exploratory and discovery elements , where only the general objective is known but not the details , which the pupils discover for themselves . These are exploratory trips . ' The latter are more educational . In the exploratory trip one makes his own observations and discoveries , asks questions , engages in discussion as a result of these observations . To be educative , experience must bring one actively into contact with new and unfamiliar things and situations . In exploratory trips dramatic elements of newness essential to learning are emphasized ; they are greatly reduced by " anticipatory " explanations . Those who employ the method of antecedent explanation ( the confirmatory trip ) also organize the trips very carefully in advance . They sometimes have the members walking in twos , military fashion . They appoint captains , outline the routes with great detail , and instruct as to manner of behavior . All this inevitably checks free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a free relation . The educative value of the trip is , thereby , greatly diminished . It is important in this , as in other enterprises , that the teacher or leader should not set the pace of learning , and even that he should refrain from seeking definite results . The value to personality development and character training lies in the very factors that are eliminated by an adult-assertive approach . Self-initiation and personal enterprise of the members , rather than aggressive adult lead- // ership , are necessary . As already indicated , the leader can not remain totally inactive , however . His assertion and participation may be necessary , but they should be exerted only as aids to the exploratory spirit of the enterprise . On the basis of our experience , some modifications in a statement concerning trips expressed in the chapter on the Activity Program3 may be necessary . Mass trips4 are more suitable for younger boys and girls than for those of upper age levels . The response to the ten trips that were actually held in our experiment indicates that mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age . It would seem , moreover , from our observation that visits to industrial plants or cultural centers for older people should be planned as group projects in which one or more groups can participate . The indefinite and exploratory ( i. e. , not connected with a definite purpose ) trips do not attract older boys as do those which are in some way related to the group 's activity . Our original recommendation that members should join trips as individuals rather than as clubs may have to be modified for boys and girls above fourteen years of age . The registration for the various trips as they were announced can be used as some indication as to what trip objectives are most attractive to city boys within the age levels discussed ( about ten to sixteen years ) . Steamships have attracted large groups on all trips . This was confirmed by the response from girls in another study . The reaction was always favorable and , according to reports from the leaders of both the girls ' and boys ' groups , these visits were educationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dramatic nature of transatlantic travel , the native travel urge in young people , and the mechanical construction of boats combine to make them desirable objectives for trips . Means of transportation generally , such as railroad yards , steamers , airdromes , appear to be of interest to youngsters . Second in popularity are trips to industrial plants with which the boys were already acquainted through advertising or through the everyday use of products manufactured in these plants . Plants are more popular if they distribute " free samples . " . // On the other hand , a trip to a steam laundry elicited no response , and it aroused strong opposition when discussed at the council meeting . All museum trips ( four in all ) got practically no response . The places of destination for young boys should deal with more dramatic and more active material than museums provide . Girls seem to respond better to museums than do boys . The trip to the Zoological Garden , discussed on pp. 145-146 , and nature walks indicate a value in this type of excursions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It would seem from our observation that both mass and group trips , whether confirmatory or exploratory , have their place in an educational program . It is suggested that all types of trips be tried and results watched before final decision is made for any specific school or center , for the response will greatly vary . It is also suggested that whenever trips are not arranged by individual groups , league councils or the school and center staff should take the initiative . For the purpose of group co-activity it would be well to have classes or clubs who sponsor trips invite one or more groups of a similar age as guests . CHAPTER XIII THE EDUCATIVE VALUE OF PARTIES Group and inter-group parties offer excellent opportunities for educational experiences and for the exercise of creative imagination . There is little value , however , in the ordinary party , where young people gather and spend the time either in self-conscious silence or in " rough-housing . " There is , on the other hand , danger in making such affairs too intellectual when adults take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous such " affairs " we founds girls ' parties too dull and those of boys too boisterous . From the standpoint of decoration , service , and refreshments , girls ' parties rank higher than those arranged by boys . Boys , however , succeed in having more " fun . " They also supply better entertainment . Perhaps the best gathering is a coeducational group where a boys ' or girls ' club is the host to a group of the opposite sex . An educational center where there are one-sex clubs should encourage these gatherings of adolescent and adult members . ( This problem , of course , does not exist where co-educational clubs are the rule or in co-educational schools . ) We found that unless the boys and girls co-operate on other occasions in the center and school or come in contact with each other in the neighborhood , mixed parties of guest and host clubs are also marked by selfconsciousness . The only common activity under these circumstances seems to be dancing . A party where the chief occupation is passing trays and plates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . This seems to be the chief purpose of most girls ' parties . Neither is it particularly valuable to have a member dance a jig or croon a " torch song , " after prolonged urging and cajoling from the others . Group gatherings present opportunities for much more meaningful interests . It is possible to transform the dull or the vulgar gathering into more worth-while experiences if the leader takes an active part in the early stages of this change . It may be necessary for him even to participate in such program , 154 // and to invite others who would add to the enjoyment of the affair as well as improve their aesthetic quality . ' We have already seen that in character education , re-education claims our major efforts . Young people automatically follow established and habitual patterns for group occupations . This includes parties as well . In addition , all such enterprises are a direct reflection of their tastes . Parties are one of the many means through which taste can be improved and originality encouraged . The educative possibilities of a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) enjoyment of a social milieu , ( 3 ) overcoming of shyness and self-consciousness , ( ? ) learning social behavior , ( 5 ) acquiring skills , ( 6 ) self-expression , ( 7 ) gaining social approbation , ( 8 ) raising the standard of aesthetic and social enjoyment . We shall describe here briefly the various elements which enter into the party as an educative experience . ( I ) Group Activity . Group planning and group execution of such plans are an effective means for social education . Co-activity not only among members of a group , but also among different groups should be encouraged . In the process of planning a party , for example , there may arise a great many differences of opinion . Clashes and even quarrels may have to be settled by a group process . Thus the principle of compromise is discovered by the participants . The need for subjugating one 's ego to the needs of the group and to group opinion is learned through such means , as they arise from active group functioning . A skilful leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertiveness on his part ) so as to call forth expression from shy or self-effacing members . The leader must be on guard , however , that the club emerges from these controversies with a sense of harmony and satisfaction , which are essential in all social functioning . ( 2 ) The Social Milieu . Group and mass parties are among the means for creating pleasurable social experiences . It can not be assumed , however , that they are alone sufficient to transform anti-social or ego centered drives into socialized i56 CREATIVE GROUP EDUCATION emotions . Modern psychological knowledge is clear on this point . Original dispositions and frequently negative attitudes toward group situations arise from early experiences in the home and in undirected street gangs . They are too deeply rooted to be reached and redirected by these superficial means alone . The average boy or girl , however , gains a great deal from this unconscious recognition that a group can be and is a source of satisfaction . This sense of pleasure begets the desire to co-operate with the group . Group parties should , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary individual and group interests . ( 3 ) Overcoming Self-Consciousness . When self-consciousness is not involved with very deep psychological disturbances ( which is too , often the fact ) , the party can be an effective means for developing in individual members a sense of security and social ease . In the planning of the party , and especially during the event itself , there is considerable opportunity for such development . The leader can skilfully draw upon the shy and unobtrusive members for such participation as seating and waiting on guests , serving , pouring beverages . The need for acquiring social ease , however , is not limited to those members who are especially self-effacing . Every young person has to learn to overcome shyness by contact with strangers in a variety of relations . He also needs to discover the contribution he can make to any group ? the best means through which he can make contact with and communicate his personality to the group . He needs also to discover the manner in which he can accomplish these ends with the greatest satisfaction to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anxieties caused by new and unfamiliar social situations . A succession of such experiences as are offered by group gatherings appropriate to age , sex , and background of the individual can aid greatly in character development and personality enrichment. ( 4 ) Social Behavior . The patterns of social behavior can not be considered as constant and immutable . Social behavior varies according to the situation in which one finds himself . Thus the human relations at a party , for example , are quite different from those at a meeting . The behavior in the former must be iii consonance with the purpose of the group . It must fall in with the mood of the group . The disturbing , over assertive individual will soon discover the impropriety // of his behavior through the criticism and disapproval of the other members of the party . Such common remarks as " you 're a nuisance , " " do n't show off , " " you disgrace the club , " " stop your nonsense , " may be helpful in some instances . But it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptom of deep-rooted psychologic stress or type-reaction , which requires a deeper approach than social disapproval . In fact , group disapproval may prove a distinct irritant , with a resulting exaggeration of the personality difficulty . The average group leader employs group castigation too indiscriminately . ( 5 ) Learning of Skills . In a properly conducted group there is complete and enthusiastic co-operation . Whenever an enterprise is planned , therefore , all members stand ready to contribute their share to the project . The activities of individual members are opportunities for acquiring skills , such as decorating the room , arranging refreshments , setting tables , serving , washing dishes , learning games , etc . The adult leader can function here in a twofold capacity . In the first place , he can , without excessive obtrusion , suggest ideas for and features of the party with a view to expanding the scope of activities . He can set a higher standard by helpful suggestions . He must at all times , however , convey the idea that the suggestions are tentative , and are subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be introduced naturally in this situation are the making of paper flowers and other decorations ; painting pictures for the walls ; making Japanese and other types of lanterns , candy baskets , caps , mural decorations , curtains , costumes ; arranging light effects ; planning costs ; buying supplies ; preparing food ; building booths ; and numerous other such activities . This work entails carpentry , electrical work , painting , and other handicrafts . ( 6 ) Self-Expression . The party offers many possibilities for self-expression on the part of many of the participants . In fact , a party given by any group should reflect the group 's and their guests ' interests and desires . Setting tables , making decorations , graceful and courteous reception of guests , artistic and manual occupations have already been discussed . In addition , the program should be planned to give expression to the predilections and talents of as many participants as possible . Those who are interested in dancing should find // an outlet at the group party . Others with musical tastes have an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar forms find their place in the evening 's diversion at a well-planned affair . In this way not only originality and creativity , but also individual social expression should be stressed . ( 7 ) Social Approbation . Although the primary biologic urge to function is behind most of human activity , the desire for social approval and recognition must be stressed . Much of the work contributed to all group activity is partially based upon an unconscious desire to exhibit one 's self and to receive social approbation . Within the limits of normality the opportunity to receive such approbation should not only be permitted but encouraged in all group enterprises . The leader ought to make every effort to secure recognition for every one . Those who participate directly in the program , of course , receive immediate attention . Others who work behind the scenes in the less conspicuous occupations should receive equal recognition . This can best be achieved if the leader or , better still , one of the members such as the president , expresses gratitude publicly to those who contributed to the preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to those who played more conspicuous roles in the enterprise . ( 8 ) Raising of Standards . The true function of education is to help the learner evolve ever higher and more cultured behavior and appreciations . As already stated , true education means progressive development both of the activity and of the person . Early educational and environmental opportunities as well as the conformity pattern combine to keep the standards of achievements and taste on a comparatively low level in the average person . This applies to personal conduct as well as to the appreciative faculties . Parties , among other things , impose a degree of self-control and responsiveness to the group mood , and thus help refine taste . We found , in our own experience , that the latter can be accomplished with considerable ease . Boys and girls , for example , have responded very intensely to poetry reading by adults and to fine music played for them . They also engaged in discussions and conversations in small groups , with an adult as the center , during a lull in the party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of // youngsters with hilarity , and that a " good time " means rowdyism . These attitudes must be changed through new experiences and a better atmosphere that the school , club , and center must create . In the creation of this atmosphere adults can not remain passive . The common technique of raising children 's standards is to criticize their behavior and to scold . This method is obviously not effective . Taste and behavior are not an outcome of will and understanding , but rather reflect the state of the total personality . Youngsters do not know what they can substitute for this form of fun . We must recognize that behavior is the outcome of one 's total being , formed out of native attributes by environmental stress and influence . It is , therefore , imperative that character and leisure-time education aid general development that is reflected in everything the individual does . The character of a party arranged by any group reflects the taste of that group and at the same time it is a multiform experience which aids the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supervisor , illustrate some of the points briefly raised in this chapter : " Arbor Day festivities . . . were carried out by individual Junior Clubs ( twelve to sixteen years old ) rather than by mass celebration . Some clubs acted as hosts to other clubs . Original programs were prepared , and refreshments were served by these boys . The practice of a club entertaining other clubs is comparatively new to center work , and has great value in developing a social spirit and co-operation . We consider this an improvement over the old inter-club activity , which nearly always meant competition among the clubs , and an effort to heat one another at some activity or another . " The effect of the new educational technique ( described in Chapter III ) was most visible in the entertainments staged by the various groups . Leaders and other adults took hardly any part in their preparation . Programs were initiated and created by the boys themselves . The entertainers told stories , played games , and dramatized songs . One club gave a shadow play on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boys constructed the sets and properties in the arts and crafts shop . They evolved the plot and invented the dialogue . Moving picture reels obtained by another group and operated by them were shown . All // electrical work in connection with this and the shadow play was done by the boys themselves . It was quite noticeable that the boys have developed in the last few months , both as to initiative and in mastery of various skills . " Another type of " party " that conformed with the general principles outlined here was an " indoor outing " held because inclement weather prevented us from holding an outdoor outing as planned . Only a short note is taken from that record : " A highly delightful party was held . . . in the assembly hall and in the scout room . Mass games , singing , stunts in the large hall ; poetry reading and story telling by the boys around the fireplace in the scout room were a source of great delight to the adults as well as to the children . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . repast . . . . " A somewhat more lengthy comment upon an entertainment given by a group of boys ' clubs , with the co-operation of some girls , **29;456;TOOLONG ( mostly of the older-age level ) , and taken from our records , is given here : " On observing this entertainment several points are brought out rather boldly . First is the fact that the aesthetic tastes of these boys reflect their environment , and that their amusement standards are set by agencies which do not foster the more cultured diversions and standards . Their ideas of what an entertainment should be reflect their background . They copy the cheap theater and vaudeville ? the only things they have seen . The gag , " Way Down Souf , " was originated spontaneously by two members , and it was better received than any of the straight stuff . ' Throughout the entertainment it was rather clear that the original numbers ( or parts of numbers ) were more acceptable to the audience than imitations of adult entertainments . " The tone of the performance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of these boys . This was evident . The degree of this repression may vary for individual boys , but it was obviously there . This suggests the question of sex enlightenment as an integral part of character education . Groups that we have tried out in this direction with boys considerably younger than those under discussion at present have gained a great deal in clarity and objectivity on the question . Their fixation on it was greatly reduced . At least the overt expression was brought under control
