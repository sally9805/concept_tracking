The issue before the country is the re-establishment of confidence by ending these delays in balancing the Budget . . . . It is not a partisan issue . . . not a controversy between the President and Congress . It is an issue of the people against delays and destructive legislation which impair the credit of the United States . It is also an issue between the people and the locust swarm of lobbyists who haunt the halls of Congress seeking selfish privileges . . . misleading members as to the real views of the people by showers of propaganda . . . . This is a serious hour which demands that the people rise with stern courage above partisanship to meet the needs of our national life . <P> It was with a warm feeling that has not come to him often during his Administration that President Hoover thus addressed the nation last week . Rarely had the White House correspondents , to whom and through whom he spoke , seen him so pleased and self-confident . Overwhelming evidence had come to him overnight that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an issue of utmost importance . The White House secretariat had showed and described this evidence to the Press-a real , continuous flood of telegrams , telephone calls and letters cheering for the President 's message to Congress the day before , a sudden , sharp message calling for protection of the nation 's credit ( see col. 3 ) . <P> President Hoover had not been to the Capitol since Washington 's Birthday , but no journalist in Washington could deny the accuracy of his " locust swarm " phrase in describing the country 's legislative halls ( see above ) . <P> The President followed up his statements to Congress and the country in two ways : 1 ) He ordered his political entourage not to pick up his words for partisan purposes . 2 ) He forewent his week-end at the Rapidan to hold two night conferences in the Lincoln Study with Treasury officials and those men of his party who really count in the Senate . At these meetings a legislative program , of which Action was the keynote , was discussed , devised . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , a tired-looking gentleman in a Homburg hat stepped off a train from New York . It was John Pierpont Morgan . ' ' I 'm just down here for dinner , " he told newsmen . " I have no statement to make . " Two private detectives closed in chorusing : " Mr. Morgan has no statement to make . " That night Secretary of the Navy <P> Adams gave a formal dinner for President Hoover at which Mr. Morgan was also a guest . Other guests included Charles Dewey Hilles , G. O. P. boss of New York and Louis Kroh Liggett . G. 0 . P. boss of Massachusetts . <P> President Hoover signed a bill whereby this year 's graduating class at the U. S. Naval Academy can be commissioned ensigns in the Navy . <P> Before vetoing the new Tariff bill which deprives him of his flexing power , the President circulated it at the State , Treasury and Commerce Departments for expert opinion as to why it should be killed . <P> " Trying to please nine different Presidents and their families in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not too cold has been some job , believe me ! " declared Edward A. Norris as he retired after 40 years service as engineer at the White House .
