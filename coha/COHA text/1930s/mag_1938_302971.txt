Since the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 there have been only a few turning points in the history of Europe . There was the March on Rome in 1922 which founded the first of many modern Fascist States ( see p. 24 ) . Another epochal moment was Stalin 's launching in 1928 of the first Five-Year Plan . Adolf Hitler then began striking from Germany , one by one , the shackles of Versailles , and last week came the mighty moment when his chain-bursting finally carried Nazi expansion well out beyond the borders of Germany , sent it crashing not only into a foreign land but into Austria-the land in which Hitler was born . <P> Good Story . The press of the world had last week a fine tale of the events which led up to Austria 's revamping along German lines . According to the tale , Benito Mussolini who twelve years ago accepted the role of protector of Austrian independence , called Vienna by telephone and told Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg that all was at an end between them , Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuschnigg crossed the border , to Bavaria , and at the Fuhrer 's mountain chalet was shown into a room where he was left alone to read a set of German General Staff plans for the invasion of Austria . Several strapping Austrian Nazis entered , shook their fists and bellowed threats at Dr. Schuschnigg . Four German generals next tried to crack him with menaces of war . The third degree was then administered by Hitler himself . <P> For several hours the Dictator bellowed and ranted at the Austrian Chancellor . <P> Shattered , Dr. Schuschnigg departed , carrying back to Vienna a 72-hour ultimatum , to which Austria 's President Wilhelm Miklas , capitulated . <P> All this was a good story , but the facts , as they belatedly emerged , left it nothing but a cock-and-bull story-except for the tremendous fact that the Chancellor of Austria and the Chancellor of Germany did secretly meet and negotiated a most vital accord which they further agreed to rush into action with the greatest haste , before Adolf Hitler was due to address the Reichstag . Dr. Schuschnigg is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious and most able statesmen . So far from the Nazis having been such fools as to try to crack him by third degree methods , the agreement , as it went into force , was chiefly remarkable for the way in which Dr. Schuschnigg had yielded much without yielding Austria 's territorial integrity or sovereignty last week . <P> Many , but not all the terms rearmed , re-mighty Germany was able to get Austria to accept , are deeply repugnant to Dr. Schuschnigg . On his return to . Vienna he earnestly discussed with President Miklas whether he could resign at once . The President asked Vienna Mayor Richard Schmitz if he were willing to become Chancellor . " No , " replied Schmitz . So Dr. Schuschnigg carried on .
