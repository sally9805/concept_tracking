txt In the midst of an impassioned plea for pas- ' sage of the soldiers ' bonus bill , Representative Edward E. Eslick of Tennessee fell dead on the floor of the House early this afternoon . " I want to go from the sordid side ? " were the last words uttered in his speech . The tragedy took place in the presence of galleries filled with ragged ex-service men , who had gathered to listen to debate on the - Patman $2,400,000,000 bonus bill prior to a final vote on the measure . It came with such amazing suddenness that the House was left in confusion . Forty minutes passed before adjournment was moved . Mrs. Eslick was seated in the gallery when her husband slumped to the floor . She was rushed to the lobby of the House on the floor below , and it was first reported that she ministered to him before he died . Physicians later announced that Mr. Eslick had probably died on his feet . Representative Eslick 's death stunned the ex-service men massed in the galleries no less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly out to tell their comrades , waiting in groups on the Capitol grounds ; word of the death of one of their champions spread swiftly throughout the bonus expeditionary force . Veterans Put Flags at Half-Staff . The news reached the main camp at Anacostia just as Harold B. Folkrod , chairman of the veterans ' legislative committee , was exhorting the men to redouble their lobbying efforts among Senators . As he announced the death , the ex-soldiers lined up in military array , bowed their heads and a chaplain offered prayer . At its conclusion the camp bugler blew taps . The American flag on he headquarters - tent was brought to halfstaff , and the veterans also lowered many of the tattered banners flying from their crazy shacks . Spontaneously veterans began taking up a collection of nickels , from men who have any money at all , to purchase a wreath . When W. W. Waters , commander-in-chief of the veterans ' army , was informed of Mr. Eslick 's death , he made the following statement : " The bonus expeditionary force has learned with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eslick of Tennessee at his post of duty . His passing is the more poignant in that at the moment death called him he was fighting for justice for the men who offered their lives in defense of our country and now find themselves destitute . " On behalf of the bonus expeditionary force I wish to express both to his family and colleagues our grief at the loss of a distinguished statesman and friend of the war veterans . " Death Laid to Stress of Emotion . Mr. Eslick , a Democrat , was 60 years old . He had been in poor health for a number of years , but his condition was not regarded as serious . Of quiet demeanor and unassuming In his contacts with other members of the House , he seldom sought the floor to speak . He had worked hard to prepare an eloquent address in favor of the bonus bill today , and physicians said that he had probably wrought himself into such an emotional pitch as to bring on a heart attack . The passing of Mr. Eslick brought to a climax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patman plan . Acting Speaker Rainey announced soon after adjournment that an agreement had been reached to discontinue debate tomorrow . The Patman bill will be taken up for admendment when the House convenes , ar1d a final vote by early afternoon is hoped for , to permit eighteen members Who will be chosen to accompany the body of Mr. Eslick to Pulaski , Tenn. , to vote before catching a 4 P. M. train . The sudden death of Mr. Eslick is the first to occur on the floor of the House since the Capitol was completed . Several members have been stricken in the building , and Representative Martin Madden , chairman of the Appropriations Committee , died suddenly in his office . Before the Capitol was completed ? on Feb. 11 , ** Tyler Bouldin , a Representative from Virginia , was stricken dead while addressing the House . John Quincy Adams , elected to Congress after his term of President , was stricken on Feb. 21 , 1848 , when the House was sitting in what is now Statuary Hall . He was carried to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , where he remained in a coma for two days before death came . Eslick Starts Speech Vigorously . Four hours had been allotted for discussion of the Patman bill when debate began at 11:20 o'clock this morning , and a dozen speakers had preceded Mr. Eslick to argue for or against the bill . He had prepared a few advance copies of his remarks for Southern newspapers , and when he walked to the well of the House to spreak , many newspapermen left the press gallery to file their stories . There was no indication of the impending tragedy as Mr. Eslick began his argument in favor of the bonus payment . He spoke calmly and with customary vigor . " I view this legislation not only as carrying out the contract with the veterans and giving them much needed relief , " he began , " but with reflecting benefits to the country at large . " e expressed the belief that not more than $2,500,000,000 currency was in circulation in the United States , and added that more was needed . " In plain English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " this contract was a one-sided contract . It was ' take this or nothing ' between the government and its soldiers . They accepted the contracts , but they were not estopped to approach the Congress and ask that they be treated like the Congress treated others . " Mr. Eslick compared the international debts and the refunding of war debts owed the United States by foreign nations . " And then we had to add a postscript to the new contracts in the President 's moratorium , " he said . " Was there any provision in the face of the second contract that we would grant additional time for the payment of interest as the Congress granted a few months ago ? Argues on Aid to Business . " when the charters were granted by the States and the national government to the railroads and insur-1 ance companies and banks and trust companies was there any provisionl in the contract that when they were in financial distress , when bankruptcy was looking over the hill at them , that the United States Government would make a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reconstruction Finance Corporation , that they might have stupendous loans from the Federal Treasury ? " No , there was nothing of this kind , but capital is the master of this country and mankind is their servant . You stand ready to revamp and reform contracts to aid aliens and to serve capital in this country , but when hungry men with outstretched hands appeal to you to liberalize their contracts that ? they may have necessary food and clothing , are you willing to say Shylock demands his pound of flesh ? " This is not all . The government owed money other than to the soldiers . When the war was Over , the government paid the contractors , not in promises but in cash , $3,000 , - 000,000 . It aided the railroads with $2,000,000,000 and shipping interests and other interests received several hundred millions of dollars in cash . " More than $125,000,000 was given to feed the hungry hordes in Europe , but when it came to the soldier you gave him a promise to pay in 1945 , twenty-seven years after the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has been to the soldier , how liberally it has provided for him . You tell us that you can not compensate the soldier in money for the discharge of duty . That may be true . The strong arm of the government sent him over there . He went , he saw , he conquered . " The government sent him away from his place of employment , it paid him $30 a month , and when his deductions were all in he got 30 cents a day . He worked side by side with a civilian in many instances for $1 a day when the other fellow got $10 a day . " When the government discharged its civilian employes they were paid $240 each as a bonus . When it discharged the veteran it gave him $60 in cash , not enough to buy a good suit of clothes and a new hat at the then existing prices . " He Yields Only to Crisp . On both sides of the aisle at this point members were on their feet urging Mr. Eslick to yield to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he finally yielded to Representative Crisp of Georgia , a warm friend but an opponent of the bonus bill . The reply which Mr. Eslick later made was his last direct remark to any person . " Is n't it true that we loaned this money to the Allies to maintain their armies in the field , and the only way we could take to get it repaid was to send our own army over there ? " Mr. Crisp asked . " That may be true , " Mr. Eslick answered . He ignored the other requests to yield and turned back to his manuscript . But his attention had been diverted and he never again read from the prepared speech . Instead , he quoted from memory the gratuities distributed by other nations to their soldiers at the conclusion of the war . " This is not a bonus , " he insisted . " It is an earned compensation . We are not the only nation to recognize this principle and we have done no more for our soldiers than certain of our allies . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now . The speaker 's calm voice died away to a monotone . He cleared his throat and continued . " This is the history of it . I am told what other countries have done . England gave her men a bonus of $1,427 ; Belgium , $492 ; Canada , a private $600 and an officer $972 ; France $249 . " Uncle Sam , the richest government in all the world , gave $60 with an I. 0 . U. ' that I will pay you twenty-seven years after Armistice Day . ' " But , Mr. Chairman . I want to diTimes Wide World Photo . Rep. E. E. Eslick of Tennessee . vert from the sordid . We hear nothing but dollars here . I want to go from the sordid side ? " There was a sharp gasp and Mr. Eslick slumped toward the floor . He sought to hold himself by grasping at the reading stand in front of him ; then , as he continued to fall , he reached futilely for a heavier table that stood between the two reading stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given by Byrne . W. L. Fenstermacher , the official stenographer who was reporting the remarks of Mr. Eslick , partly caught the falling man . A dozen members of the House rushed to the well , one of them a professional physician . Dr. George W. Calver , the House physician , was quickly summoned , and desperate attempts were made to revive the Tennesseean . A short recess was taken as soon as the House grew calmer . In the interim a resolution was prepared by Representative Byrne of Tennessee and Speaker Rainey . The galleries remained spellbound by what they had witnessed . Members of the House wept , with no tempt to hide their emotions . There ' , were tears in his eyes when Mr. Byrne rose to eulogize briefly the man who fifteen minutes before had been of them . He uttered the words haltingly . " He was beloved and esteemed by every member of the House , just as he was beloved and esteemed by every citizen of his State , " Mr. Byrns said . " No man was better known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that State for his many splendid qualities of both mind and heart than he . " He died as I know he would have liked to have died , here upon the floor of this House , the scene of his labors for several years and in the active discharge of his duties . " The Congress , the Nation and his own State and his Congressional district have suffered a great loss in his passing . " Mr. Speaker , I shall say no more , but I offer the resolution which I send to the clerk 's desk . " Fewer Veterans Are Arriving . Realizing that a favorable vote in the House is certain but that the bonus can not win in the Senate unless several votes pledged against it are changed , the bonus army is concentrating its lobbying on the upper house . Mr. Foulkrod , who is directing the lobbying , addressed the veterans in the various camps today , advising them to visit Senators from their own States . He cautioned against any show of truculence . There was a slackening today in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed ; thousands are reported on the way from various points . There was an unmistakable increase in the number going back home . The police reported that 180 have arranged to leave tomorrow afternoon , riding the first fifty miles in District of Columbia trucks . A delegation from the South probably will join them . The rainy weather of the last few days has dampened the ardor of many of the men , and circulars repeating the offer of free transportation , which were distributed today at the order of General Pelham D. Glassford , Superintendent of Police , had their effect on others . " Here I 've been sleeping on concrete and at home I have three meals a day , a bed and a job , " one Atlanta man was heard to say tonight . " I 'm going home . " Commander Waters reiterated today , however , that the defections were insignificant and were individuals who had left bectuse of illness at home or some other emergency . The first fatality in the Bonus Expeditionary Force occurred this afternoon . Roy T. Schwartzlander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , died at the Anacostia camp of heart disease . Although District of Columbia authorities are pressing for early evacuation by the bonus army , their belief that the veterans might stay a long time was indicated today by arrangements for sewer facilities at the various camps and a survey of the half-wrecked buildings in which many of the men are billeted . Representative J. Howard Swick of Pennsylvania , a physician and a Lieutenant Colonel in the Medical Reserve Corps , is now assisting at the veterans ' clinic . Sick call continues to average 600 a day , but no signs of an outbreak of serious disease are apparent . Member of Congress Since 1925 . Edward Everett Eslick was born in Giles County .
