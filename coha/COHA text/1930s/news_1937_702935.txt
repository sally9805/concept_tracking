txt Those of us who opposed the Social Security Act at/the time of Its enactment exposed ourselves to the reproach that we opposed social security . That was ' far from this writer 's intention . I objected mainly to the reserve'feature of the old-age pension scheme , because , by a process of what I called make-believe , It involved a double levy In creating the reserve and then in meeting the pension . The scheme was criticized in behalf of the beneficiaries . I will explain the double burden system after I have described the set-up of the Old Age Pension fund . This is based upon the usual private insurance principle of an interest-yielding reserve . After the scheme has been in operation for five years , the fund will be taking in each year 16 times as much as it is paying out . At the end of 10 years It will still be taking In five times as much . As a result of this storing up of payments , close to 850,000,000,000 will have been accumulated by 1980 . The Interest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any furthell contributions ; to make It , in other words , self-sustaining . There were many horrified exclamations when the suggestion was made that this reserve would be spent as received on current expenses . But this is exactly what Is happening . The money Is flowing into the Treasury at one end and flowing out at the other in payment of current expenses . That is one reason that the Treasury has stopped borrowing to meet the budgetary deficit . The Social Security Act has put the budget , by a back-door route , in balance , and by next June , Congress willing , there will have been a net reduction In the public debt of several hundred million dollars . * A What of the Old Age Pension reserve ? Well , that is filed with I 0 U 's signed by the Treasury , or government bonds . This , I know , sounds like financial legerdemain . It is cruder than that ? it is what is now generally called hocus pocus . But , granted the reserve principle for a government fund , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well fill a box with the actual dollars paid in . It simply took the money , spent it , and reduced its borrowing to that amount , The net is a transfer In ownership of the public debt to the Old Age Pension Account . Eventually , the account will be carrying It all . Indeed the account is a temptation to extravagant spending , in that the Government has to spend 00. - 000,000,000 over and above receipts by 1980 , In orderthat the account can acquire that evidence of indebtedness . The public debt is now $37,000,000,000 , Secretary Morgenthau was responsible for the provision for a reserve fund . Obviously , as events have proved , he had budget balancing in view . The notion sounded plausible to a people who , as a Jesuit of constant reiteration by business men . persist in thinking of government as no different from any business corporation . In this case the Government was held to be acting with the wisdom of a private insurance company , Government and a private business , however , are as different as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private insurance company , certain citizens called policyholders would be obtaining interest on money which they had lent to all citizens called the Government . A businesslike arrangement ! The fund in Washington , however , is a government fund , in the custody of a branch of the Government . the Old Age Pension Account . This branch of the Government is lending money to another branch called the Treasury and being paid Interest for doing so . To what does this boil down but that the same person in the form of Mr. Taxpayer is paying himself interest ? That is a reductio ad absurdum , and shows that a country can not insure itself , any more than a person can . A A A In a campaign speech at Milwaukee Governor Landon used a vivid simile In portraying this reductio ad absurdum , He pictured the workers bringing 6 per cent ( employees , 3 per cent ; employers , 3 per cent ) of their wages to their father . The father was to invest the money for his sons ' old age . He decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own I 0 U 's , and he put these in a box with another paper promise to pay 3 per cent interest . Then he spent his sons ' contributions in meeting his own regular expenses and put " the rest in various schemes that fascinated him . " The real situation is not truly pictured by this illustration . For it is the people themselves who put their own I O U 's in a box and decide to pay themselves interest upon them . That interest will have to come out of their own pockets in the form of taxes , and , instead of being self-sustaining , therefore , the reserve fund means nothing at all , and old age pensions will have to be paid out of taxes as if no reserve fund existed . This is what is meant by a double levy . Old age pensions should be put on a pay-as-you go basis , financed by a new income tax system broadened at the base on the La Follette model .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
