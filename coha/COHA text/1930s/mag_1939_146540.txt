Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina was the little brown bandit who ruled the Dominican Republic as President from 1930 to 1938 . He then refused a third term " following United States precedent " and now rules instead as generalissimo of the army . He was much put out this past year as he watched the parade of other Latin-American strongmen to Washington : Cuba 's Batista , Nicaragua 's Somoza , Brazil 's Aranha and Monteiro ( TIME , Nov. 14 , et seq . ) . All these received official invitations , were saluted , handshaken , welcomed at the White House . But for Dictator Trujillo , no invitation came . <P> So he bought Julius Fleischmann 's 225-ft. yacht Camargo , renamed it Ramfis for his small brown son , announced a private pleasure trip to the New York World 's Fair-via Washington . This squeeze play soon brought forth almost all the invitations Dictator Trujillo had yearned for-a gala at the Pan American Union , dinner with Acting Chief of Staff Marshall of the U. S. Army , audience with Secretary Hull , tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luncheon by Haiti 's Minister Elie Lescot , to prove that Haiti has forgiven Trujillo for his troops ' extinction of some 18.000 Haitians in bloody border patrol work in 1937 . <P> Last week the dapper Dictator docked at Miami , sped to Washington by private car . A guard of honor ( four squads of Marines , with drum &; bugle corps ) met him at Union Station and celebrations began along the well-trodden trail-wreaths at Arlington and Mount Vernon , inspection of the CCC camp at Fort Hunt , cocktails with Congressmen . But the next day , Death squelched the squeeze play . In deference to his late Secretary of the Navy ( see below ) . President Roosevelt postponed Trujillo 's tea to this week . The visit with Secretary Hull became a brief formal call. * The Pan American party was canceled . <P> <P> *Chief favor which Dictator Trujillo seeks from Washington is control over Dominican Customs , now collected by the U. S. to insure payment of interest on old loans .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
