txt Self-government in Newfoundland Newfoundland , usualWill Be ly spoken of as EngRehabilitated , land 's senior colony , is to go into temporary reCeivership . A commission of inquiry reports to the House of Commons that economic and political conditions in the island are desperate . It is planned to suspend the Colonial Legislature and turn over the work of rehabilitation to a mixed committee of Britons and Newfoundlanders . A drastic operation on the public debt is to be among the first steps . Perhaps young OSWALD MOSLEY will hail this as the first victory of fascism over democracy in the British Empire . Yet it may be recalled that a much bigger dominion than Newfoundland ? namely , Australia , with thirty times its population  --  fell into grave economic and financial difficulties a couple of years ago , but is now handsomely working its way out by established constitutional democratic methods . High-powered epithets are Our de rigueur in contrasting the Bad merits of the NRA with the Past . evils of the " old system . " Even so , a former president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone pretty far the the other day . He said at a big public luncheon : " The poorest code that has yet been approved is a hundred times better than the economic banditry under which we previously had to operate . " Perhaps it is unreasonable to expect any one today to say a kind word for our pre-1929 economic civilization . Still , to call it banditry is a bit strong . But a careful reading of Mr. O'CoNNELL 's remarks will show that he was not speaking of the system of 1929 but of the demoralization following upon the crash of that year . He said : " If , in the middle of 1932 , when we frantically were working to stop the stampede of price-gutting and the prostitution of quality " ? He is speaking of post-depression commercial morals , not of predepression days . If Mr. O'Co NNELL deSome fined his terms carefully , Things it is not to be expected Forgotten . that others will be as conscientious , and we may hear mech about the pre-NRA economic order as organized banditry expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have already heard a great deal of our pre-1929 economic system as dependent on child labor , wage-cutting and mass exploitation in general . The facts are pretty nearly the other way . The period before 1929 may have been crazy , but it was not the murderous rage of the bandit . On the contrary , its dominant purpose was to keep on making the American people better paid and better housed and happier ? no doubt for the sake of personal profits . There was no suicidal price-cutting before 1929 . Indeed , it is the farmer 's complaint that all prices but his own were too high . The big exception was automobiles , where technical progress made price reduction possible . Child ' labor was being rapidly eliminated . There was little degradation of quality . In the main , people before 1929 wore better clothes than ever before , lived in cleaner homes , ate better food  --  or at least consumed more milk and eggs  --  and went much more often to high school and college . The real trouble with pre-1929 was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last .
