In the chaotic days following the great Japanese earthquake of 1923 a young police captain , Masahiko Amakasu , held in his custody a Socialist leader , Sakai Osugi . Amakasu was a member of a group of young Japanese firebrands who vehemently denounced internationalism , who were then seriously beginning a successful struggle to make the army master of the Japanese Government . In cold blood , with his own hands , Captain Amakasu strangled his internationally-minded prisoner . He deputed to a subordinate the less important job of garroting Osugi 's wife and 10-year-old son . <P> Brought to trial , Captain Amakasu had a good defense : he had gained nothing by Osugi 's death ; his was a purely patriotic murder . He was given only seven years and he was out in a little more than two . When the Japanese Army entered Manchuria and set up the so-called state of Manchukuo , Amakasu went over to help occupy , was presently active in Manchukuo 's " General Affairs Bureau . " Naturally he was appointed vice-chairman of a Manchukuoan Good Will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tour of Italy , the Vatican City , Germany , Rightist Spain , El Salvador , nations which pretend there is such an independent State as Manchukuo . <P> To go to such widely separated nations the good-willers necessarily had to pass through other countries , including England and the U. S. To 25 Manchukuoan glad-handers , British and U. S. consular authorities last week had readily granted visas . But neither Britain nor the U. S. would grant the honorable Mr. Amakasu even a transit visa . To Britain a murderer is still an " undesirable alien . " to the U. S. a murderer is still guilty of " moral turpitude , " to both a murderer is a murderer .
