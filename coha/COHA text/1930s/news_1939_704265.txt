txt Paradoxically enough , the real fight over the repeal of the arms embargo has shifted to the House of Representatives , although the Senate has not yet voted upon it . Repeated indications al.e that the House is much more closely divided on the issue than the Senate . The Senate debate has dragged through three weeks and now seems headed to conclusion next week . Today , the isolationists brought out one of their best speakers in a sort of summing up address . Senator Hiram Johnson ( R ) of California . With characteristic emotion and fluency he deplored a step which he declared would place the United States " in the shadow of war . " Now Senator Johnson has spoken as well as his veteran team-mate of the old League of Nations fight , Senator William E. Borah ( R ) of Idaho . Other isolationists of the Senate have made their addresses and some of them have spoken two or three times . Despite all this every poll taken shows a big majority for repeal , so far as it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week or 10 days . Here the situation is not so promising for the Administration . The fact is , that the isolationist speeches have had a cumulative effect in the House , bolstering the anti-repeal side . ? Last session the House voted 214 to 173 to return the embargo provision to the Bloom neutrality bill contrary to the White House wishes . That showed a majority of 41 votes against the key feature of the bill round which the whole struggle now centers . The Administration must not only keep its previous forces in line but win over 40 or more additional votes from members who are already on record as favoring the embargo . Thus , the attention of both political observers and of Senators themselves has turned to the other chamber even while the Senate fight continues . The House is waiting in a sort of mysterious silence for its turn to take the stage when the Senate gets done talking . Senator Johnson 's speech was directed as much - to wavering House members as to the public at large . Noted for his emotional presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran Senator Borah as the ablest Senate exponent of the isolationist school .
