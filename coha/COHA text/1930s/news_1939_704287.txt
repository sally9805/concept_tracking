txt Murray Hearn Other candidates endorsed or described as qualified by both these organizations are : Louis P. Goldberg Arthur Leventhal John Francis Moore J. Roland Sala Next come candidates for the COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS This election concerns only voters in New York County . Two places are to be filled . Four candidates for these two places have been endorsed or described as well qualified by the bar associations and the Citizens Union . They are : THE VOTER GOES TO THE POLLS When the New York voter steps into the voting booth today and swings the lever that closes the curtain at his back he will find before him a voting machine on which top place is given to AMENDMENT NO. 1 This is the proposal to legalize parimutuel betting on horse races . It is the only constitutional question on which the New York voter will have to decide today . The amendment has been opposed on moral grounds . But the question seems to us to be a practical one rather than a moral one . Since we believe that some evils can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils will be created by it , we recommend a vote in favor of this amendment . Immediately below Amendment No. 1 on the voting machine come the judicial offices to be filled at today 's election , beginning at the left with CHIEF JUDGE , COURT OF APPEALS There is only one candidate for this office , Irving Lehman , now Associate Judge of this same court . His endorsement by all three political parties insures the election of a man whose character and ability eminently qualify him for this post . Following Judge Lehman 's name come the names of candidates for JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT Here voters in New York and Bronx Counties will vote to fill five places . Three present justices , all endorsed by the bar associations in these counties and by the Citizens Union , are candidates for re-election . On the principle that experienced judges who have given meritorious service should be kept in office , these three deserve preference at the voters ' hands : Felix C. Benvenga Ernest E. L. Hammer Louis A. Valente There are three other candidates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or well qualified by all these bar associations , as well as by the Citizens Union . They are : Macdonald DeWitt Edgar J. Nathan Carrol G. Walter Voters in Kings , Queens and Richmond will fill four places on the Supreme Court bench instead of five . Again three present justices , all carrying the endorsement of the Brooklyn and Queens bar associations and the Citizens Union , are candidates for reelection . They are : Joseph Fennelly Frank E. Johnson William R. Wilson Other candidates endorsed or described as qualified by both these bar associations , as well as by the Citizens Union , are A. David Benjamin James M. Fawcett Edwin C. Morsch Nicholas H. Pinto Next in order on the voting machines come the names of candidates for JUSTICE OF THE CITY COURT Only in New York and Kings Counties will voters fill this office . In New York County one justice is to be elected . The candidate described by the bar associations as well qualified and by the Citizens Union as qualifed and preferred is Frank A. Carlin . In Kings County three places are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brooklyn Bar Association and Jonah J. Goldstein John A. Mullen Leo J. Rosett Jacob G. Schurman Jr . Last on the list of judicial candidates come candidates for the Municipal Court , to be elected only in certain districts of Manhattan , Queens and Brooklyn . The roll of candidates is too long to be summarized here , but we repeat two earlier suggestions made on this page : Voters in the Third District of Manhattan have an opportunity to re-elect in the person of Justice Dorothy Kenyon a candidate endorsed by the bar associations and described by the Citizens Union as having " exceptional capacity " for judicial service . Voters in the Fourth District of Brooklyn are advised to note that Justice Jacob S. Strahl , while endorsed by the Brooklyn Bar Association , is described by the Bar Association of New York as " disqualified for re-election * * * by reason of his use in the recent primary of a slogan tending to indicate partiality in favor of a certain class of the community and appealing to class passions and prejudices . " Next and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few candidates for COUNTY OFFICES Voters in Kings will elect a new District Attorney . Since that official will undoubtedly have to investigate conditions and prosecute cases involving Democratic machine politicians , it is common sense to pick the candidate not under obligations to the Democratic machine who has the best chance of winning . On that ground we urge voters in Kings to give their support to William R. Bayes , who has Republican , City Fusion and independent backing . Voters in Kings will also elect a Sheriff and a Register , and in Richmond a Sheriff . Here the public-spirited citizen can do most good by voting for Council candidates in favor of abolishing these worse than useless positions . CITY COUNCIL When the voter has recorded his choices for these offices and his preference as to Amendment No. 1 he will be finished with the voting machine . As he leaves the booth he will be handed a paper ballot on which to mark his choice of candidates for City Council . Here he may vote for as many candidates as he chooses ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in which case his ballot will be thrown out ) but with the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , etc. , indicating the order of his preference . It is perfectly clear that for the regular Democratic machines in the five boroughs the election of the new City Council will be a matter of practical politics . If the machines can get a working majority they can do a number of things . They can postpone county reorganization , so that county patronage will remain under their control . They can prevent pension reform . This will add $400,000,000 to the city 's debt , though it may win the gratitude of a good many thoughtless members of the Police and Fire Departments . They can obstruct and bedevil the expense budget , the capital budget and all local legislation . In brief , they can hold the fort for machine government in the hope that some day the city will return to the old regime of inefficiency , waste and favoritism . If this ambition is realized every voter in the city will soon or late feel its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , will have to help pay for it  --  in rents if not in taxes , in cost of living if not in rents , in poorer schools , poorer public services of all kinds . For the independent voter , therefore , this election is also a matter of practical politics . And to the independent voters of the five boroughs we again recommend the list of seventeen Council candidates endorsed by the Citizens Nonpartisan Committee as known to be in sympathy with the constructive policies of the Fusion administration and in accord with the spirit of the new City Charter : MANHATTAN  --  Joseph Clark Baldwin , Emmanuel A. Manginelli , Langdon W. Post and Robert K. Straus . BROOKLYN  --  James Amadei , i Anlrew R. Armstrong , Lawson H. Brown , ? Genevieve B. Earle , Edward S. Finegan , Harry W. Laidler and Barnett Rosenfeld . QUEENS  --  Charles Belous and F. William Guma Jr . BRONX  --  Archie B. Morrison , Salvatore Ninfo and Charles Rubenstein . RICHMOND  --  Frank L. Markey . Each independent voter can doubtless add to this list ( except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of other candidates in his own borough with whose character and abilities he is familiar .
