For a President-reject his last speech is generally his most difficult . On domestic questions his voice has ceased to carry popular authority . On foreign issues the nations of the world are inclined to accord him only the scantiest attention . Such was the problem President Hoover faced last week when he journeyed to Manhattan to deliver his valedictory before the National Republican Club . He solved it with an address on the broad subject of gold . <P> As a good-by to cheering G. O .. Partisans , the President first declared : <P> " An organization that can show more than 15,000,000 adherents after 70 years - an irreducible minimum in the reaction from the worst depression the world has ever seen-is indeed testimony to the virility of the principles which Lincoln enunciated . Those principles assure that the Republican Party will be recalled to power . . . . The people determined the election . We have no complaint . As Americans we will continue wholeheartedly to do our part in promoting the well-being of the country . . . . " <P> Swiftly putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President took a long look at the world at large . His voice taut and dry with earnestness , he declared : <P> " We are in the presence of an incipient outbreak of economic war with the weapons of depreciated currencies , artificial barriers to trade by quotas , reciprocal trade agreements , discriminations , nationalistic campaigns to consume homemade goods and a score of tactics . . . each of which adds to world confusion and dangers . . . . We find some 44 countries definitely off the gold standard . . . . The United States has held stanchly to the gold standard . . . . We have thereby maintained one Gibraltar of stability in the world and contributed to check the movement to chaos . . . . We will be forced to defensive action to protect ourselves unless this mad race is stopped . . . . <P> " If the world is to secure economic peace . . . the first point of attack is to secure greater stability in currencies . . . . In all the welter of discussion there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of gold as a basis of currency and exchange . . . . But we have to remember that it is a commodity the value of which is enshrined in human instincts for over 10,000 years . The time may come when the world can safely abandon its use altogether but it has not yet reached that point . . . . The fears and apprehensions directed to the stability of first one nation and then another have caused . . . large flows of gold to meet exchange demands . . . . Thus a mass of gold dashing hither and yon from one nation to another , seeking maximum safety , has acted like a cannon loose on the deck of the world in a storm . . . . <P> " The solution can only be found now and found quickly through the re-establishment of gold standards among important nations . . . . Nor is it necessary that those nations who have been forced off the gold standard shall be again restored to former gold values . It will suffice if it only is fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us could be set aside for temporary use for this purpose , we should not hesitate to do so . ... A reasonable period of comparative stability in the world 's currencies would repay the cost of such effort a hundred times over . . . .
