When Home Owners Loan Corp . was organized in June 1933 with $3,000,000,000 to lend , many a citizen asked himself : Would the U. S. Government ever foreclose an HOLC mortgage and take over a U. S. home ? By last week the Government had quietly foreclosed 99 mortgages , had quietly marched in and taken possession of 99 homes . Only ten foreclosures were caused by the owners ' willful failure to pay . The rest resulted from abandonment or death . Highest number of foreclosures ( 32 ) was in the Cincinnati district ( Ohio and West Virginia ) , lowest ( 1 ) in the New York district ( New York , New Jersey and Connecticut ) . <P> To date HOLC has taken mortgages on some 800,000 homes . Last week HOLChairman John H. Fahey reported that 30% were a few weeks behind in payment , 16% were 90 days behind . Fortnight ago he declared that out of 400,000 loans studied , only eleven were likely to show a loss to the Government . Cried Ohio 's Representative Sweeney : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then Mr. Fahey is a wizard . " <P> Already a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor , Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy , Officer of the Order of the Golden Sheaf of China , Chairman Fahey holds down the uneasy title of world 's biggest mortgagee with notable efficiency . HOLC has dismissed 236 lawyers for incompetence . Chairman Fahey 's ideal of a business interview is reported to be 4 min. for business , 30 sec. for greetings and farewells . People lucky enough to get inside his crowded office in the Post Office Building find a distinguished old gentleman with a snowy Vandyke beard , twinkling eyes , rippling humor . New Hampshire-born and educated , he has , in his 62 years , published the Boston Traveler , superintended the Associated Press 's New England division , conducted a Boston investment house , operated a shipyard in Florida , helped found the U. S. Chamber of Commerce .
