The P. E. N. Club is an international association of writers . Its members include most of the world 's top poets , playwrights , editors , essayists and novelists . First international president was John Galsworthy . President now is Jules Romains . Founded 18 years ago in England , P. E. N. has spent 17 years of its decorous , softspoken , ineffectual existence passing futile resolutions and trying to make next year 's meeting better than the last . Nations might rise or fall , populations perish , wars rage , but P. E. N. merely raised its penciled eyebrows , insisted that the writer 's business is to write and that writing is a world by itself . <P> No trumpets sounded a change as 55 P. E. N. delegates from 29 countries forgathered at the New York World 's Fair last fortnight to hold their three-day World Congress of Writers . Quietly and peaceably the writers filed into the egg-shaped , modernistic Hall of Music . But once inside , they threw down their pens with a bang heard in Berlin , Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink on Dictators Hitler , Mussolini and Franco . <P> Strange indeed was such unanimity among writers , stranger still P. E. N. 's sudden plunge into politics . Startled observers asked themselves : Are P. E. N. writers ahead of their readers or are they just catching up with the world 's fear that civilization is doomed ? Do they really mean to fight the forces threatening it ? Answers to the second question were not long in coming . <P> P. E. N. President Jules Romains is the short , highbrowed , big-nosed author of Men of Good Will , whose desire to report the whole life of his time in one novel has carried his book to its 15th volume . Listening as Author Romains reported P. E. N. 's change of front in 60 minutes of rapid-fire French sat writers from lands as far apart as Chile and China , delegates from Australia , Uruguay , Finland , South Africa-Germany 's Thomas Mann and Ernst Toller , Spain 's Pedro Salinas , China 's Lin Yutang , France 's Andr Maurois , the U. S. 's Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent Sheean . But many of the delegates ( German , Italian , Spanish ) could claim no country at all . <P> Spontaneously they applauded Romains when he said : " We are no longer able to act as if tyranny did not exist . Therefore , we must act in order that it shall not exist . In this struggle , every day more urgent , no one can exactly take our place . " Solemnly they heard him call the rape of Czecho-Slovakia " a flagrant violation , " the rape of Albania a gesture " of diabolical flamboyance , " cry " that from this great meeting there comes forth a sentence without appeal against the mystics of violence . " <P> Paraphrased Hendrik Willem Van Loon : " . . . Our left flank has been annihilated , our right flank has surrendered , and our centre is beginning to give way ; we shall therefore proceed to the attack . " <P> Dorothy Thompson : " We are united against the destruction of the poets . " <P> Thomas Mann : " Democracy is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wain : " I am done entirely with patriotism . " <P> Pedro Salinas : " We must not be too confident that culture can defend itself . "
