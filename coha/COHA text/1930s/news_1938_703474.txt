txt One of the most brilliant meteors seen in modern times flashed across the northern sky at exactly 10 o'clock last night in a spectacular display of cosmic fireworks . Many persons who saw it wondered if it was an explosion , a crashing airplane or a fireworks display . The meteor suddenly took fire at a point southwest of the Big Dipper half-way up the sky and flared in a white-hot streak across nearly twothirds of the sky and . across the northeast horizon . Several persons who saw it said the head seemed half the size of the moon . It appeared to be moving slower than the meteors ordinarily seen and lasted three or four seconds . The spectacle gave a thrill , of joy that most astronomers hope for , but few attain , to Charles Federer , one of the lecturers at the Hayden Planetarium . He had just finished a lecture on the- man-made stars in the dome of the Planetarium and had gone out on the lawn in front of the building to try out a new telescope made by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mounted on a tripod and I was looking through it at one of the stars in the Big Dipper , " he said . " Suddenly a bright light seemed to fill the sky . I looked up and saw a ball of fire streaking across the sky . It was a surprising sight .. I could hardly believe my eyes . " It looked like a Roman candle or a rocket with a brilliant . fiery exhaust . My first thought was that it was an airplane with something wrong with the exhaust , but then it moved faster than any airplane could go . It started southwest of the pole star and flashed acrosss two-thirds of the sky , disappearing in the northeast . The head was a brilliant glowing point , not like- a bright star with a trail behind it , but a large mass that seemed fairly close to the earth . It left a long streak of white light tinged with blue . " Mr. Federer estimated the speed of the meteor at anywhere from ten to thirty miles a second . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by astronomers to distinguish it from an ordinary - meteor because of its size and brilliance . Meteors generally take fire at about a hundred miles above the earth because of the tremendous friction as they pierce the upper atmosphere at high speed , he said . He estimated that the fire ball last night ' fell to within forty miles of the earth , but added that it was impossible from his observations to judge whether it struck the earth . truck the earth and some , from mall fragments to large masses ig*g tons , are on display in seums . Most meteors burn out ? before they reach the earth . The earth will cut its annual path through the Perseid meteor stream on Aug. 11 , he said , but he added that last night 's flash was not a part of that stream . Instead , he said , it appeared to be moving toward the stream . The sudden visitor seemed to be a lone wanderer that came from nowhere without any predictable time or place for its appearance : With many inquiries coming into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flash in New York , Long Island and New Jersey , Mr. Federer said the Planetarium would appreciate written descriptions from persons who saw the meteor . It does not make any difference whether they know anything tsbout astronomy or not , he said . The Planetarium staff wishes to compare observations for an accurate description of the meteor .. Seen in Suburban Area An observer at . the Meteorological Bureau of the United States Army air field at Mitchel Field reported that he had seen the meteor streak across from west to north about forty-five degrees below the zenith . This observer said it disappeared over Hicksville , L. I. , in a movement that seemed fairly slow . A resident of Englewood , N. 3. , who called the Planetarium , said he saw the meteor flash across the horizon to the north . A man living on West Tenth Street said he saw the flash through a window looking north and that the streak of light seemed to remain in the air for several seconds . A meteor has no relation to a comet except in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appear stationary in the sky . They are seen when they move around the sun and the appearance of , known comets can be predicted by astronomers .. Most of them are very , large in mass . Meteors are the broken up parts of disintegrated masses , flying irregularly through space , and are seen frequently . Many of them have
