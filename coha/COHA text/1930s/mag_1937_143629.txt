The U. S. loves to be lectured . For no years it has been paying countless U. S. and British writers to exhort , educate and berate it . It all started in 1826 , when Josiah Holbrook of Connecticut and the lyceum movement began the long , uncomfortable cross-country trips of uncertain financial return and doubtful educational value that have come to be known as lecture tours . <P> And it still goes on . Last fortnight , Nobel Prizewinner Sinclair Lewis strode jerkily onto a platform in Manhattan , and with hands in pockets , galvanic shrugs and many a wisecrack , proceeded to deliver his eighth lecture of the season . An explosive , rapid-fire attack on stage censorship , Reds , Fascists and Ernest Hemingway , the lecture was entitled It Has Happened Here . Next month he will repeat his performance in Albuquerque , N. Mex . That same week in Upper Montclair , N. J. , Salvador de Madariaga will be going on about The Future of Liberty , and Ludwig Lewisohn will be holding forth on books . In Grand Rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be talking on The Art of Relaxation , and in Brooklyn , Dr. Houston Peterson ( The Melody of Chaos ) will discuss Aldous Huxley . Martha Gellhorn talks that week in Chicago , Younghill Kang ( The Grass Roof ) in Wheeling , W. Va. , and Captain John D. Craig ( Adventure in Haiti ) in Ann Arbor , Mich . In addition there will be a number of lectures belonging to the Great Question Mark school of public speaking , with David Seabury in Detroit asking What Makes Us Seem So Queer ? ; John T. Flynn in Elizabeth , N. J. , What 's the Matter With Us Now ? ; Stanley High in Boston , Where Do We Go From Here ? ; and Vicki Baum in Salt Lake City , Why Be Afraid ? The week when all this takes place will be exceptional but not unique for its lecturing activity . A banner season for lectures , the winter of 1937-38 will see about 200 authors giving 10,000 lectures to audiences of approximately 2,000,000 listeners-not counting the performances of magicians , mimes , dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do business with lantern slides . <P> For writers whose income from books is uncertain and fluctuating , lecturing is still what it was in Emerson 's day : a profitable sideline . But rates have changed since Emerson was glad to speak for $5 and oats for his horse . Last month H. G. Wells spoke seven times , made $21,000 . Next spring Thomas Mann will get $15,000 for his 15 lectures . For the 23 lectures on Sinclair Lewis ' crowded schedule , he will get $23,000 . Although their agent makes the rates of such headliners as Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt and Aldous Huxley a carefully guarded secret , their net return will probably not equal the $33,000 that Dale Carnegie will be paid for his 55 inspirational talks in 55 towns . <P> But most of the 200 writers who give the U. S. its surfeit of literary talk get no such fees . In the declining scale of rates , a best-selling author like Dorothea Brande ( Wake Up and Live ! ) can count on getting $500 a lecture , while best-selling writers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quoted at $200 . The majority of lectures are delivered at prices ranging between $100 and $200 , and in the case of impromptu readings of poets or proletarian novelists to radical groups , rates finally taper off to $5 an evening or just for fun .
