txt The test on silver which has been overhanging the Administration 's monetary program for several weeks has taken definite form . What is likely to prove the " overt act " in a congressional maneuver to override White House plans came Wednesday when Senate Agriculture Committee decided to consider an amendment to the Dies bill providing for r.ilver purchases . The meeting was held behind closed doors . Senator Thomas ( Dem. , Okla. ) proposed such an amendment to the bill . Further a subcommittee was named to consider other silver plans , including the Wheeler and Fiesinger bills in connection with the Dies bill . It is believed that there is already sufficient strength in the House to pass a silver bill . The situation in the Senate is more uncertain . While silver advocates do not publicly claim sufficient votes to pass a bill . they have said privately that they believed they can obtain them . Speaking in behalf of the Administration , Secretary Morgenthau has opposed further silver or monetary legislation at this time . Also on request of President Roosevelt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fiesinger bill , which was to have been taken up along with the Dies bill . Whether the Administration will throw its full weight against silver or whether it will attempt to compromise with the silver bloc is uncertain . It is probable that the silver advocates could not muster sufficient strength to pass a bill over a Presidential veto . The strategy of amending in the Senate the Dies bill which the House has already passed was adopted by the silver bloc with the hope of assuring a vote by both branches at this session . Senator Thomas of Oklahoma announces he will move in the committee to appoint a subcommittee to revamp the Dies silver bill along lines which will include provisions to nationalize silver at the rate of 641 , : : cents per ounce . His proposal will include provisions to buy silver in the world market . paying the world price until silver reaches $1.29 per ounce . The declared policy under the proposed Thomas amendiiient will be to use both gold coin and silver in primary money and that the silver dollar should contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dollar Coinage The proposal calls for issuance of silver certificates against all silver procured by the Treasury at the rate of $1.29 per ounce , and to pay out such certificates for silver purchased . keeping the excess certificates for profit to United States Treasury . The profit would result from the difference between the purchase price and the official price of $1.29 . Under the plan silver dollars would no longer be coined and the silver acquired by the Treasury would be molded into bars . An effort will be made by the agricultural committee to present to the Senate next week a bill embodying the views of the silver bloc in Congress . The recent meeting of stiverites in the Senate selected Senator King of Utah to head a committee which was delegated to work for a unanimous agreement among all silver advocates in House and Senate on a silver bill . The subcommittee appointed by the agricultural committee to consider silver legislation is headed by Senator Wheeler of Montana and composed of Thomas of Oklahoma , Pope of Idaho , Capper of Kansas , and Shipstead of Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a composite silver bill would be drafted and returned to the full committee early next week .
