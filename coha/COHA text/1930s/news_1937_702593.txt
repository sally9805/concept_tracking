txt While the governments of the world are piling up armaments  --  adding intolerable burdens to the public and producing a situation in which a universal conflagration at any moment may be precipitated by an unguarded spark  --  a call for sanity begins to echo more and more persistently around the nations . How can the menace be averted ? How can the mad race be stopped ? How can the energy of the people be turned to more constructive and amicable ends ? Answers to these questions are advanced by sir well-known writers , English and American , in search of a practicable solution . After Bea rmament  --  Wha First of Six Articles By Wickham Steed Former Editor The London Times Written for The Christian Science Monitor " This Is quite an insane world " ? Rudyard Kipling wrote me on Dec. 30. 1935 , his seventieth birthday , - or is it because I am 70 that I am persuaded of the essential insanity of it ? All the same . I would I were 50 , with a chance to see how it will all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are quite right . The world , or much of it , is insane , and it will not regain sanity until the leading nations have brought their thinking abreast of their technical and mechanical advance . There may still be a breathing space of a few years . I do not yet feel catastrophe to be as certain or as imminent as I felt it in 1912 or 1913 . But I am quite sure that unless the futile attempts merely to stop war , and the silly belief that non-war and peace are synonymous , are soon given up and men are taught to conceive peace as a high , risky and therefore attractive adventure , our so-called civilization will perish of maladjustment .. . There is still a chance that sanity may win . Today the chance that sanity may win seems brighter . British rearmament is one of the things that hastemporarily  --  helped to restore balance to what was a verb , unstable equilibrium . Call for Balance " A call to sanity " is an appeal for better balance in an unbalanced world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconditional mental state , so balance is liable to be upset by changing stresses . And there are at least two sorts of balance , the static and the dynamic  --  the stability of a bicycle propped up against a wall and the stability of the same bicycle well ridden . What kind of balance do we desire when we lament the lack of stability in the affairs of nations ? We mean , I think , some fixed safeguard against violent upset , so that our untroubled minds may reason out what had best be done . The desire for this sort of balance is , I fear , Utopian . It takes too little account of men 's love  --  which may amount to a vital need ? of activity , of adventurous risk . The arms race is a form of adventure . Criticism of this adventure runs on two main lines . It is sheer folly , say the economically minded . thus to waste the wealth of nations on unproductive expenditure . The arms race can only lead to war , say its opponents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini . Still less is it the view of Gen. Erich Ludendorff. whose book , " Total War . " teaches that . since war is the highest and fullest phase of a nation 's being . every material and spiritual resource should be pledged to preparation for and the actual waging of it A New Angle on War Nor should it be forgotten that the thought of war as a reprehensible form at activity is comparatively modern . Thinkers and seers nave long protested against the war-method of dealing with international claims and disputes . but in practice governments and peoples have been deaf to these protests . Up to 1914 war was generally looked upon as a lawful undertaking , and armaments in readiness for it were held to be the acme of sound reason . For generations statesmen worshipped the " balance of power . " Only during and after the World War did some of them come to feel that what was wanted was not - balanced " power but unbalanced power against countries or governments which should think of making war . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson said on Feb. 14 , 1919 , when ne presented it to the Paris Peace Conference : " Armed force is in the background of this program , but it is m the background . and if the moral force of the world will not suffice , the physical force of the world shall ' His statement . which events have since belied , contained no suggestion of an " arms race . " Its underlying idea was unbalanced . over- wheiming force against war-makers and law-breakers . At the time this idea was widely ' welcomed . Few paused to consider how revolutionary it was . It proposed to deny legal status to war-making in the same way as legal status is denied to piracy . Few , if any , of the nations were then really ready for so revolutionary a proposal . Few are ready today . Words and Phrases ? This may be why phrases like " collective security " have lost favor . They come to be looked on as shibboleths or incantations . " The renunciation of war , " " the reign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " an overwhelming peace front " have had no better luck than " collective security . " The solid present fact of the arms race overshadows them all . Why ? The answer , I think , is threefold . The men and nations who will the end of suppressing war but shy at the means are not yet convinced that they themselves are in immediate danger . Even when they apprehend danger to themselves they do not yet feel that they are full and responsible members of an international community whose safety from violent attack is their individual concern . And a third and deeper ground for their hesitation is uncertainty about what they are actually asked to do . They are asked to preserve and to uphold " peace , " and for this purpose to sacrifice national sovereignty and to run what may be great risks . So . almost unconsciously , they wonder what this " peace " may be ; and nobody has yet gone far beyond the point of telling them that it is " freedom from war . " Here lies the snag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be non-war . What is wanted is a convincing demonstration that peace would be a very lively , very adventurous . very thrilling state of things , indeed , the very " moral equivalent for war " of which William James once spoke . Can not Be Negative After some years of thought I am persuaded that war will never be overcome by negative means . Nor am I convinced that , by itself , even the setting up of an overwhelming balance of force against war would bring peace to the world . Lam not against setting up this ovtrwhelming balance . The phrase " collective security " does mean something real . And 1 feel that men and nations to declaim against war and yet advocate neutrality in regard to it stultify themselves in the same way as members of a community who object to violent crime would stultify themselves if they were to withhold support from the agencies which , in their communities , are responsible for the repression of crime . In the words of that great English lawyer , the late Lord Parker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his share of the burden of humanity . " But even the general renunciation of neutrality by nations which might feel themselves to be responsible members of an international community would only establish non-war . It would not create peace . What , then , do I mean by " peace " ? Roughly , I mean a state of things in which nations would want not to hurt or take advantage of . but to help each other . It is not easy to say how this state of things could be brought about . But a small beginning might be made . A Dream " Sometimes I dream that the three greatest of the world 's free nations , the United States , Great Britain and France , might earmark , say , 10 per cent of their arms budgets for a peace fund . They would use part of this fund to organize and train an emergency peace force whose members would be unarmed but otherwise fully equipped to render help wherever help might be most needed . The task of these national emergency peace forces would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to cope with emergencies , to relieve misfortune or want , or to fight epidemics in any part of the world . They would need engineering , medical and scientific staffs and all the means of swift locomotion . I should like to see a race between the richer nations of the world in this sort of armament . It gives me no joy to think that governments like those of Germany and Italy may one day feel they have only a choice between economic breakdown and warlike adventure ; that is to say , between two kinds of misery and ruin for themselves and others . If I could help the German and the Italian peoples , irrespective of their present political systems , I would . The free nations of the world bear a heavy responsibility . They can arm themselves to the teeth and . In so doing , create temporary artificial prosperity at the cost of ultimate impoverishment . Some of them are doing It not without present reason . Yet , if they think themselves more truly civilized and nobler than other peoples that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to remember that " noblesse oblige , " and that " richesse " in things material and spiritual likewise has its obligations ? I anticipate the objection from my fellow countrymen that it would be folly to spend money for others when so many of our own people lack work or dwell in " distressed areas . " Still , the heart of the world has not gone out these 1900 years to those who were indignant at the woman who came with the " alabaster box of ointment of spikenard , very precious " because " it might have been sold for more than 300 pence , and have been given to the poor . " True enough , this matter of poverty is , no less than war , a challenge to our civilization . We are trying to do something that has never been done before  --  to base social welfare and culture and leisure otherwise than on slave labor . All the great civilizations of the past were based on slave labor .. Aristotle thought slave labor indispensable to the well-being of citizens ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position would be different . We have found the machines though we have not yet settled their proper function in our civilization We have not brought our thinking abreast of our technical and mechanical advance . Indeed . we are preparing to use this advance for the international self-destruction which we still call " war ! ' Function of Machines I wonder whether a way out of the arms race might not be found , and a way to a constructive goal of a new world order , if a real " peace demonstration " were made , without hope of material reward , by the greater among the free nations . Even if it should cost ? 140,000,000 of the British ? 1,400,000,000 rearmament program , I know a lot of people who would gladly pay their share of it . Above all , it would be a great adventure , Peace advocates too often forget that men 's love of adventure , and the deep human yearning for self-devotion to something higher and bigger than self , must find an outlet . Peace , rightly conceived , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saneness ought to be revealed in the biggest possible way ; and the great nations that are still free would not do amiss were they to show their faith in the excellence of their freedom by revealing it . Then , I think , the nations would revolt against the madness of the arms race and might begin in earnest to make life on this planet worthy of the sons of men .
