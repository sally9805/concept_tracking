F. O. B. DETROIT-Wessel Smitten- Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> In the 63-year period from Samuel Butler 's Erewhon to Charlie Chaplin 's Modern Times , writers have thrown tons of literary monkey wrenches into capitalism 's mass-production machinery-with about the same effect as a man kicking the sideboard he stubbed his toe on . Machine-hating writers still evoke sympathetic response , but another school has lately gained ground . <P> They see the fight between men and machines as the central drama of our time , but they think the solution lies in controlling machines , not hating them .
