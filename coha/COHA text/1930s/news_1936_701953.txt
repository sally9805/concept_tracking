Presbyterian Church in the United States of America , and members of the three congregations joined them in a walkout . Orders barring the ministers from the pulpits were issued by the Presbytery of Philadelphia and read in the churches at the morning services . With the reading of the notices , the Fundamentalists in the congregations departed , leaving the churches in the hands of those loyal to the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . The action of the Presbytery of Philadelphia widened the breach between the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and the Presbyterian Church of America , the new denomination founded early in the week by the dissident Fundamentalists . About two-thirds of the ninety worshipers at the Grace Presbyterian Church , Twenty-second and Federal Streets , walked out of the building with the Rev. David Freeman , pastor , as a delegation sent by the Presbytery announced that Mr. Freeman was forbidden to conduct the services . Mr. Freeman is a charter member of the Presbyterian Church of America . Services at the church were conducted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who withdrew met for services in the home of Mrs. Eugene Hollenbach , 2,431 Oakford Street , a , block from the Grace Church . " I consider the action irregular . I regard myself as being ousted from this pulpit , " Mr. Freeman said when the statement from the Presbytery was read to prevent him from conducting the services . The demonstration that followed had been prearranged , as the majority of the congregation arose and walked out with Mr. Freeman . At the Memorial Presbyterian Church , Columbia Avenue at Twenty-first Street , the orders were read announcing that the Rev. Theodore J. Jamsma would not be permitted to occupy the pulpit . As soon as the reading was finished Mr. Jamsma said : " I feel the order from the Presbytery-is like that of a Pope . " Followed by seventeen of the forty in the congregation , Mr. Jamsma marched across the street to the Chris J. Perry Negro Elks Home and held services there in a room bare of all furniture except some chairs festooned with pink ribbons , which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rev. Orville Cowdrick conducted the services at the Memorial Church . The Rev. Merril T. Macpherson , minister at Central North Broad Street Presbyterian Church , Broad and Green Streets , did not occupy the pulpit there . Instead he conducted services at Lu Lu Temple , in Spring Garden Street , east of Broad Street . Minister to Organize Church There were about 700 at the services in Lu Lu Temple and about sixty worshipers at the North Broad Street Church . The Rev. Dr. Aquilla Webb was in charge of the services at the North Broad Street Church . Mr. Macpherson announced that he would organize a church of his own and that it would be patterned after the ' Moody Memorial Church in Chicago and would be strictly fundamentalist in character . Unlike the situation at the Grace Presbyterian Church and at the Memorial Church , no attempt was made this morning by Mr. Macpherson to preach at the church where he was ordered not to appear . Mr. had been notified earlier in the week of the action of the Presbytery . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lu Lu Temple . He made intensive efforts to publicize the place of meeting . The Central North Broad Street Church has an endowment of about $250,000 . The Presbyterian Church of America , which held its first general assembly here , concluded its four-day sessions with a public meeting this evening in the New Century Club , 124 South Twelfth i Street . Six graduates of Westminster Theological Seminary were ordained in the ministry of the new denomination , and the Rev. Dr. J. Gresham Machen , head of the faculty of the seminary and founder of the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions , delivered the principal address . Dr. Machen , one of the Fundamentalist leaders and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of America , asserted that the Presbyterian Church ini " the United States of America had forced its ministers to support Mod-1 ernist doctrines and put " man 's word above the Word of God . " Sees ' Man 's Word Put Above God 's ' " The temptation to Christian people to remain in the Presbyterian Church in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that good may come , " said D. Machen . " If a pastor remains , he must tacitly or explicitly , directly or indirectly , support modernist boards and he must put man 's word above the Word of God by acquiescing in the commendation of whatever program may be established at any time by shifting majority votes . " No faithful Christian man can do either of these things . How , then , is it that some Christian men , under such conditions , are remaining in the old church organiza-tion ? " Continuing , he said : " It is because the temptation comes to them in very subtle forms . Some of them are pastors of large churches . They love their people , they say , and their people love them . The Lord , they say , is blessing their work . If they give up their churches , some modernist will be put in . Better to acquiesce , they say , for a moment , in the requirement of the modernist ecciesiastical machine in order that modernism may be the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same temptation that came to Jesus in the wilderness . The devil showed him all the kingdoms of the world and offered to give them to him if he would bow down and worship him . " The offer was not , I think , an offer of opportunities to do evil ; it was rather an offer of opportunities to do good . If Jesus seated himself at once upon the throne of the kingdoms of the world , what untold good would be done ! There would be no massacres and no wars , no triumphant march of the conquerors over the ghastly figures of the dead . Instead , there would be a universal reign of peace . Just a little moment of obeisance to evil , and the world would belong to Jesus henceforth that he might do good ! Calls Old Church ' Unchristian ' " So today Satan 's demands seem to be so slight . Just acquiesce for a little moment in these unchristian mandates , just keep silent for a little while about the modernism of the boards , and then you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Just a little dip of the colors and the Christian army can go on ! " Well , the army is going on , this , army of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America . It is an army 2,000,000 strong . Only it is a Christian army no more . That dip of the colors made all the difference in the world . The Lord our God is a jealous God ; He accepts no divided allegiance ; He has said once for all : ' Thou shalt have no other Gods before Me . ' " There are some who are not deceived . " The Presbyterian Church of America is composed of such . It is not a large army at first , but a little group of weak and sinful folk . Yet it is a real branch of the church universal , a real part of the church of God . " It is not that because it has made itself that , but because Christ has bought it with His own precious blood . With that confidence and only that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , opposed to the world but at peace with God , to preach the only gospel that can really bring salvation to the souls of men .
