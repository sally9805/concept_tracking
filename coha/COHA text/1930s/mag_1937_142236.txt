The arch-conservative New York Herald Tribune surprised its readers last week by changing its typeface to a bigger , bolder cut . Last week Herald Tribune readers were further astonished when the paper suddenly and with no explanation dropped the famed Conning Tower column of Franklin Pierce Adams ( " F. P. A. " ) . Mr. Adams cheerfully explained in a characteristic sentence : " They just wanted me to work for less money , whereas I wanted to work for more . " But New York newspapermen knew that the differenfce went deeper than dollars . Between stolid , self-conscious Mr. Reid and saturnine , self-satisfied Mr. Adams , for 16 years a quarrel had smoldered . <P> In 1921 , F. P. A. left Mr. Reid 's New York Tribune to join the World . Mr. Reid considered this an act of disloyalty . At the end of the World in 1931 , Ogden Reid did not want F. P. A. back on his paper-now the Herald Tribune-on any terms . But Mrs. Ogden Reid knew the sheet needed a good column and overruled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was later reduced to $21,852 . <P> Three years ago , F. P. A. asked for a new contract , left his column out of the paper for one day until Publisher Reid , who does not like to sign things , acquiesced . The resulting document , to hold for three years , was signed by the columnist but never by the publisher . Last week when this " one-way " contract came up for renewal , Mrs. Reid could not break the impasse . Remarked Columnist Eleanor Roosevelt in My Day : <P> " I wish very much that F. P. A. and the New York Herald Tribune had not parted company so suddenly . ... If this could have been done in a more leisurely fashion we might have been able to find his column in another paper . " <P> Other newspapers in which F. P. A. " has conducted a column go back to the Chicago Journal of 1903 . Next F. P. A. column appeared in the now long-dead New York Mail following year . Ten years later , F. P. A. was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. A. was a captain in the Intelligence Service , wrote a column , The Listening Post , in the A. E. F. newspaper , The Stars &; Stripes . In his years of column-conducting , F. P. A. has been noted , like Chicago 's late Bert Leston Taylor ( " B. L. T. " ) as much for his contributors as for his own writings . Some favorite F. P. A. " contribs , " under their own names and various pseudonyms , have been Poets Edna St. Vincent Millay , Dorothy Parker , Arthur Guiterman , Writers Sinclair Lewis Morrie ( Of Thee I Sing ) Ryskind , Ring Lardner , John Erskine , Edna Ferber , Composer Deems Taylor , Funnyman Groucho Marx .
