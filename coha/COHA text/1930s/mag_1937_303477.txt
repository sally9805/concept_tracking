John Raltenbury Skeaping never went to an ordinary school or college , it being his father 's conviction that children wasted their time learning things in school which they could master in a few months after growing up . His father was a painter , his mother a pianist . When he was three years old , John began to draw horses and fanciful animals ; when he was seven , his father started him to work with oils . He trotted for miles over the Essex countryside following farm horses , watching the jounce and ripple of muscle , the play of light on sweaty hide . <P> When he was nine , he took to arguing with his father about art and his mother started teaching him music . His sisters went off to London to study ballet dancing , and John decided to go too . He danced doggedly for two years , gave it up because the students were forbidden to ride bicycles or horses . Back in art school he switched from painting to sculpture because he liked the physical exertion of carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlist in the British Army but that year the War ended . He left home , got along for ten years on a continuous succession of scholarships . As a student in Rome he lived in a thieves ' den . In Naples he was nearly murdered . In 1927 he felt that his career was launched at last when a handful of important people came to his first show . <P> Opened this week at Manhattan 's Walker Galleries was the first U. S. exhibition of John Skeaping 's animal drawings . In almost all these the focus of Skeaping 's interest is the interplay of muscle and shadow . On view were an infuriated elephant , with eyes bulging out of its head ; grave , long-fingered , acrobatic monkeys ; a Dartmoor pony standing in ferns that look like fossil prints ; an old Zebu bull with mountainous shoulders ; a leopard which is almost pure draftsmanship without substance . A formalized antelope reminded visitors of the wall drawings of Cro-Magnon cave men . A group of storks and herons seemed to be millions of years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 36 , John Skeaping considers himself an expert horseman , a fair fisherman , spends one day a week at the race tracks if he can . Twice married , he has a son by his first wife , whom he divorced in 1933 . He is chief instructor of the London County Council 's school of animal drawing just opened at the London Zoo .
