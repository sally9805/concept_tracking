txt Robert Connor , 21-month-old " explorer " whose wanderings in the woods near his Hartsdale Manor home almost cost him his life , was reported yesterday to be gaining strength and convalescing slowly . The child , whose mysterious fiveday disappearance from the white clapboarded cottage of his parents had caused one of the most widespread investigations in the East since the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby , was moved from Grasslands Hospital to White Plains Hospital in the afternoon . The change was made so that the baby could . be under the closer supervision of attending specialists , who warned that Robert , famished and in a serious condition after five days in the woods , must have " days of careful attention before he can be considered out of danger . " At 11 o'clock last night Dr. Charles L. Suttles , the Connors ' physician , issued the following bul-letin : " The baby 's condition is slightly improved . He continues to retain his nourishment by mouth and is being amply supplied with fluids by other methods . Temperature 100.2 , Pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Child Not Hidnapped . As the youngster was being nursed slowly back to health , authorities who had investigated his disappearance agreed  --  some of them apparently reluctantly  --  that the child had not been kidnapped for ransom ; that he had not been abducted by a deranged or abnormal person and then abandoned to his fate . Robert 's valor had simply proved greater than his discretion . Frank X. Fay , Department of Justice agent in charge of the case , reiterated again yesterday that the " case was closed , " and State , county and town authorities agreed with him  --  though in less emphatic language , and some of them at the expense of cherished theories . Despite reports to the contrary , Department of Justice agents , fifteen of whom worked on the case , State troopers , and the police of the town of Greenburgh , in which Hartsdale Manor is situated , returned to their stations , and the isolated little community set on the edge of Secor Road , in Westchester 's hills , resumed last night the calm round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition was the subject of all-consuming interest not only to the parents , Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Connor , who remained in seclusion , but to the nation-wide host of friends and strangers whose - sympathy and interest had been stirred by Robert 's disappearance . Mrs. Herbert H. Lehman , ' wife of the Governor , was one of many who telephoned to the hospital to inquire about the child 's condition . When told that he was progressing satisfactorily , she said she was " very thankful . " The child was attended by a corps of nurses and doctors during the day . Two specialists , Dr. Suttles and Dr. Dorothy Lang , who later ordered Robert 's removal to White Plains , were directing the treatment . The baby , who had lost eight pounds during his five-day fast , was " frightfully starved and emaciated , " physicians said ; his skin was scratched by brambles , browned by the sun and wet by the rain ; he had been bitten by insects . Apparently all he had had to eat , it was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk only what little water he could scoop out of holes in the ground . Blood Transfusion Not Needed . Because of Robert 's " remarkable improvement , " a blood transfusion was not considered necessary . The child received three ounces of milk every four hours and the injections of saline solutions were continued . The baby , his scratches bandaged , was more alert and interested in his surroundings yesterday than he had been the night before , shortly after he had been found in a thicket only three-quarters of a mile from his home . He was restless , which was considered a good sign , and cried now and then for his mother . Mrs. Connor , herself exhausted after days of anxiety , did not visit the baby , however , as physicians wished to keep Robert as quiet as possible . Physicians who examined the child apparently continued to hold the unanimous opinion yesterday that " Robert 's condition points clearly to the belief that he has been out in the open during all the time he was missing from home . " This theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road near his home into the uncultivated and overgrown country that borders ! it  --  was accepted as the final solution of the case by virtually all who investigated it , though many still continued to express amazement that a 21-month-old child could ( have penetrated so deeply into such ( country . Two points  --  that the area where ' the baby was found had not previously been searched and that the child had been walking since he was 14 months old  --  helped to convince even most of those who were reluctant to discard the kidnapping theory . Second Shoe Found . The baby 's other shoe , which was not found Tuesday night after the child 's discovery , was discovered yesterday on top of a two-foot stone wall near the place where the child was lying . A State trooper , crawling beneath bushes and weeds that hung over the wall , noticed the shoe in a position that indicated it might have been flung or dropped there by the lost child . After a final conference , Philip J. , chief of police in Greenburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for an investigation into the source of a " crank " letter mailed from Brooklyn to Frank A. Saporito , acquaintance of the Connors and criminal lawyer of Westchester County , during the investigation . The letter , it was made clear ; had nothing to do with the baby 's discovery , or with his disappearance , but was a crank 's attempt to capitalize on the case . Mr. Fay packed his bags and left White Plains , and Chief came to New York , where he discussed the case in a radio interview over WOR . He said that the kidnarping theory had been " disposed of " and added that the ease was definitely classed as that of " a lost boy . " District Attorney Frank Coyne was not so positive in his acceptance'of this solution of the case . " I have not necessarily accepted the theory that the child was lost , 1not kidnapped , but in the absence ' of anything to support the kidnapping story , I must accept the verdict of other authorities , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my of-1 fice I shall be available . I did not participate in the direction of this investigation but freely offered the facilities of my office to those in charge . " Captain Christopher Kernmler of Troop K , State Police , was one of the last to concur with the opinion that the baby had merely wandered away from home , but last night he admitted that the evidence strongly supported that theory . The child 's parents , whom he interviewed early , in the evening , also have accepted the opinion , he said . " Mr. and Mrs. Connor were still skeptical this morning , " Captain Kemmler said , " but later in the day they told me they are completely satisfied that Robert wandered off by himself . " Reappearance of some of the Federal agents at the Connor home yesterday afternoon started rumors that the authorities were re-opening the investigation , but it developed that they had merely called for personal belongings they had left there .                 @ @ @ @
