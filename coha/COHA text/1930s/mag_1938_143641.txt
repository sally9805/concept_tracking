Front-paged by the august New York Times one day last week was a story about an editorial in Justice , house organ of David Dubinsky 's International Ladies Garment Workers Union . The Garment Workers have had plenty of good publicity this winter from their Labor Stage musical revue Pins and Needles but the Justice editorial was in dead earnest . Profoundly regretting the breakdown of the A. F. of L.C. I. O. peace negotiations , the editorial declared : <P> " The disappointment over this failure will be felt more keenly in view of the fact that a practical approach to peace was deemed to have been in sight only a short while ago . . . . Given the will and an unbiased handling , these problems , it seemed , could be settled by diligent application within a reasonable time . . . . " <P> Pointing out that A. F. of L. was ready to compromise on the question of industrial unionism for mass production industries and had even agreed tentatively to a curb on the powers of its executive committee , the editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was that the " logical and workable solution " of the remaining difficulties was " completely tossed out of the window . " This proposal was to set up joint subcommittees to settle the jurisdictional claims of rival C. I. O. &; A. F. of L. unions , subsequently allowing the original C. I. 0 . unions to return to A. F. of L. as a group . " Such an approach , it seems to us. could not have been stigmatized by any right thinking person as ' treason ' or ' desertion ' by either side . " In other words , the Garment Workers placed responsibility for the breakdown of the peace negotiations squarely on the head of John L. Lewis . <P> Such sentiments coming , officially sanctioned , from one of the original C- . I. 0 . unions were of prime Labor significance . With John Lewis ' United Mine WTorkers and Sidney Hillman 's Amalgamated Clothing Workers , the Garment Workers Union was one of C. I. O. 's principal pillars . Its cash support alone has run to some $300,000 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial support has been the Garment Workers contribution in manpower . In 1926 when a disastrous strike cost the union some $3,500,000 , the only solvent local was David Dubinsky 's . He was made president of the international union in 1932 , after the death of famed Ben Schlesinger . Under the New Deal membership has jumped from 40,000 to 260,000 . <P> The Union owns a $500,000 non-profit vacation resort in Pennsylvania 's Pocono Hills . Some 25,000 members are enrolled in union classes , learning everything from trade union tactics to ballroom dancing . The Union goes in for sports , clubs , pageants , dramatics , music-and politics . For the Garment Workers Union is one of the twin pillars of the American Labor Party , which holds the balance of power in New York State politics . Labor Party chairman is Luigi Antonini , president of the world 's biggest local , Garment Workers No. 89 with 42,000 members .
