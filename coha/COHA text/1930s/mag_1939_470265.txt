AT THE age of seventeen I was virtually a cripple . A childhood injury had brought on osteomyelitis , and as a result my right leg was shorter than my left , my left hip-joint was semi-rigid , and I suffered from painful abscesses . Lame , feeble , neurotic , I was only a wistful onlooker at athletic sports . But a miracle was about to be wrought . Two blocks north of my home in Louisville , Kentucky , some Jewish citizens had built a one-storey gymnasium as the nucleus of a Y.M.H.A. It was large and well equipped and it had an extraordinary physical director . I used to loaf at the side door and watch the members go through exercise drills . One of my friends , " Banty " Murphy , had suddenly blossomed into an all-round athlete , boxer , tumbler , and performer on the horizontal bar . Banty had urged me to join the gym ; he told me other afflicted and deformed boys and men had been built up into vigorous health there , and he was sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he idolized . One day while I was watching Banty do stunts on the horizontal bar an impulse prompted me to follow his advice . I paid five dollars for a year 's membership and bought second-hand tennis slippers , and Murphy lent me old running trunks . So it happened that one day I stood naked on weighing scales in Athletic Director Gearhart 's office . With clinical but compassionate interest he inventoried my physical assets and liabilities . Then he said , " Rucker , you should loafin our back yard . It 's covered with tanbark . Our track boys train there . Take plenty of rest but little exercise . Never get tired . Lie naked in the sun . Come indoors every hour for a cold spray , then back to the sun . " What luck to meet so kindly and intelligent a healer and to have an outdoor gymnasium within two blocks of my home ! I doubt if there was another within three hundred miles . Three months later I had gained weight , my corpselike pallor under the brushwork of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash on my face was clearing . Best of all , the abscesses were definitely shrinking . Cautiously , I began exercising . I slept each night ten to twelve hours . I practically lived in the gymnasium and its tanbark-covered back yard . After six months I was perceptibly less lame . Prodigal Nature had set about compensating for the pulled-out socket ; my legs now seemed of equal length ; I walked almost erect , and heaven be praised , the last abscess had closed ! Mentally I was metamorphosed as much as physically : low spirits and fear were replaced by buoyancy and confidence ; I seemed to be living in a new world . " Kid " McCoy and Joe Choynski , star fighters , were exhibiting at the Buckingham Theater , and the management had offered fifty dollars to any local fighter who could last four rounds against them . A huge Negro from Tennessee was billed to try his luck against Choynski . Though I had no money for a ticket , the doorman , fat Tom Whallen , lame half-brother of the theater owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery . Through a murk of tobacco smoke I looked down on a brightly lighted stage where a rangy athlete in purple tights was thumping a punching bag . He was Joe Choynski . His bag stunt ended , he skipped lightly over the ropes of a prize ring , the first I had seen . From the opposite side of the stage lumbered his giant opponent . A baldish little man in a wrinkled tuxedo climbed into the ring , held up a hand for silence , and shouted , " Introdoocin ' the heavyweight champeen of Tennessee . " The Negro towered over spindle-legged Choynski , and looked mighty enough to tear him apart . A bell clanged and the black giant leaped across the ring , rushed Choynski to the ropes , tore free of clinches , and let fly a barrage of whistling swings that seemed sure to knock Joe through the stage wails . Some of his sledgelike blows appeared to land on the white man . I marveled that anyone could withstand such an onslaught . How the crowd yelled ! In all my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreating . I saw him land a right against the black man 's ribs , and start another . But the second blow seemed to hang in midair . Yet , for some inexplicable reason , that gigantic Negro crashed to the ring floor . His handlers dragged his body off as if it were the carcass of a horse . The first knockout I had seen . Mystified and thrilled , I resolved as I walked home that I would study boxing ; I would learn to defend myself . My researches began immediately . Daily I practiced footwork , feinting , blocking , ducking , and leading . I hammered a punching bag and I closely watched the boxers at the Y.M.H.A. In thirty days I had developed a bothersome left jab and a bit of defensive skill . New boys in the gymnasium began to shun me ; I had to take on bigger ones . In two months I had learned to relax , to keep the other fellow moving , to tuck in my chin ; and I was gaining surprisingly in stamina . My arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knockout Instructor Gearhart asked me to appear in a public boxing exhibition . My opponent was the star lightweight of the gymnasium , but I felt no uneasiness . I won a four-round decision . My picture was published in the papers as a promising amateur boxer . A few weeks later an inter-club tournament for boxers was held at the swank Louisville Athletic Club . Director Gearhart entered me in the lightweight class . I went triumphantly through the preliminaries , and took the final with ease . The outstanding amateur lightweight boxer of Louisville was Henry Richardson , of the Neat-Richardson Drug Company family . Henry was my ideal athlete . Lithe in build , he was astonishingly versatile , a crack football player , tumbler , and performer on the horizontal bar . Two acrobatic feats he could execute which to me have always seemed inexplicable ? the backflip and the giant swing . Richardson 's following finally took notice of my rising reputation and his brother Bill proposed a fight . I accepted ; I had grown cocky enough to fight Joe Gans had I been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Bill . " As many as you like , " I replied . " How about a finish fight ? " " Suits me , " I said . Richardson and I met in a suburban hall . Following current custom , we waited until the gloves were on before choosing the referee . The man who was finally chosen was Isaac F. Marcosson , then a cub reporter for the Louisville Times , later a well-known journalist and author . Henry Richardson and I mauled each other that night for fifteen bloody rounds ? one hour elapsed time . Then , with both of us battered and tottering , Referee Marcosson decided that he had had enough even if the fighters had not , and he mercifully called it a day ? and a draw . I had been hearing of a middleweight fighter in a tough neighborhood called Limerick , a hard hitter who licked all corners with or without gloves . He was Jack Burke , nephew of Mike Hickey , owner of a saloon , and a ward boss in the potent Whallen political machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in Kentucky , Ed Rucker preferred . Why he singled me out for special mention I never learned . But it was more than a cocky young boxer could endure . Down to Hickey 's I hurried and in less than a quarter of an hour had arranged all details for a meeting with Burke in his own bailiwick . In making this match I had no thought other than it would be just another lark . I had not the slightest intention of turning professional . Burke and I fought in a large dance hall back of a Limerick saloon . He was ten pounds heavier than I , but lacked my skill . My chief second that night was Thompson Buchanan , who was himself a bit of an athlete . I knocked Burke cold in the first round and the referee had counted to seven when ? the lights suddenly went out ! In the darkness I could hear Mike Hickey cursing the referee and grumbling demands for a square deal . It was ten minutes before the lights came on , and by that time Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair deal . " Let Hickey referee , " I offered . But those who had bet on me demurred . Finally a cousin of Burke 's was proposed by Hickey , and I agreed . I knocked Burke out again in the second or third round . I do n't know what restrained the cousin-referee from disqualifying me on a foul , maybe for hitting below the Adam 's apple . That fight was for me of the greatest importance , for Irish Mike Hickey now became my loyal supporter and staunch friend , and his saloon served me as a club , office , and commissary . There were other fights , and within two years of the time when I joined the Y.M.H.A. gymnasium , " Kid Rucker of Louisville " had been signed to fight Steve Crosby , a nationally known professional . II Bewildered at being catapulted into professional boxing , I went out into the street after signing to meet Crosby . I had never had the slightest thought of professionalism . Only yesterday , it seemed , I had limped unnoticed along this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every few seconds someone called , " Hello , Ruck , " or " Luck to you , Ed . " But this certainly was not what I had dreamed life would be . What was I getting into ? Was I the Rucker black sheep ? Perhaps I should chuck it . But no , it was too late ; I must not show yellow , especially in this match , which I had decided would be my last . As I swung south on Fourth Street it began to rain , and I paused in a doorway . Someone slapped my shoulder . It was Norvin Harris , a well-to-do Kentucky horseman . He had read the news in the late editions . He offered me his country lodge for training , and I jubilantly accepted . Another acquaintance , fat Will Botto , extended his hand . When Botto heard of Norvin Harris 's offer , he said , " I 'd like to kick in too ; let me furnish the groceries . " The Harris lodge perched on the slope of a hill adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large living room looked down on a countryside dotted with farmhouses . Behind the lodge we built a boxing ring and put up a punching-bag platform . Bag thumping drew kids from miles around , and soon their fathers followed to see how the contraption worked . Thereafter punching bags drummed in half the county farmyards . Among our visitors was a lumbering youth , a year older than I. He volunteered as a sparring partner , but peeled off his shirt with plain misgiving . He had scrapped in stables and sandlots but of boxing he knew next to nothing . He was big and willing , however , and he had thick wrists and huge paws . This youth was Marvin Hart ; five years later he became heavyweight champion of the world . I tried to go easy with Marvin , but punches will slip , and often his knees buckled . When I offered apology for a hard smack he smiled and said he did n't mind getting socked , that he wanted to learn to take it . He took plenty in those days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive out daily in a high-seated Stanhope . Only five feet one inch tall , he weighed two hundred pounds and was almost globular in appearance , but always wore expensive tailored suits . A former theater usher , he was at the moment delirious from sudden riches , the steamboat riches of Capt . James Irvin , eccentric miser of the river , dead these five years . He had just married the Captain 's aged widow . The underworld sent its representatives . There was " Dago Joe " Leon , who smoked opium , but was an expert rubber . He was a small , bent , sallow Sicilian who stuttered ; he had lately migrated from New Orleans where he had been a trainer for Andy Bowen , the Creole terror , who was killed in a glove fight with " Kid " Lavigne . There was " Dago Foley , " pickpocket , chattering of pokes and ices , snitches and harness bulls , gats and shits . Like Fatty Botto , he was always faultlessly tailored and could have passed for a youth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of resin were Col. John Whallen , of the Whallen Brothers , owners of the city 's burlesque palace , and gentle old Charlie Shaw , resident manager for the Avenue Theater . You can imagine how I swelled with pride when Colonel Whallen said , " Ruck , any time you want tickets to the shows just send word , " and Shaw added , " That goes for the Avenue too . " The theater was also represented at the camp by Baker Rock , who later became a high-salaried dance director for the New York stage , and by Ben Harney , the song-writer . Harney brought his guitar , sang his own compositions , and talked ragtime . How he talked ragtime ! He sometimes called it syncopation or negro dance time . He had recently toured the South in vaudeville , had scored a big success in New York where he appeared in a piano program with a tiny Negro dancer , and had just published The Ragtime Instructor . Among his own song-hits that he played at the lodge were , " Mr. Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the nation , and " You 've Been a Good Old Wagon , But You Done Broke Down . " He showed how to rag standard music by playing on the piano in ragtime " Annie Laurie " and " The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo . " When Ben Harney died in obscurity in 1938 , Time magazine justly referred to him as the father of American ragtime . Another talented entertainer who contributed to our camp gayety was a Negro cakewalker , " Frogeye , " who claimed , perhaps justly , the world 's cakewalking championship . His nickname was derived from his comically bulging eyes . He had won first prize in cakewalks from Louisville to New Orleans . Cakewalking was as popular in those days as jitterbug dancing is today . It was chiefly a Negro frolic , but was patronized by " white folks . " " Frogeye " was on hand several nights a week , eager to perform when Harney strummed his " Cakewalk in the Sky . " Publicity was handled by another picturesque character , Verney ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose daily column , " Gim me a Match , " in the Louisville Times , amused race fans for a quarter of a century . Grinning over the advance sale for my fight , Screw appeared daily shepherding groups of visitors . " It 'll be a sell-out , " said he . " Orders coming from Nashville , Evansville , Indianapolis , Lexington . It 's a natural for Kentucky : nigger against white , slugger against boxer , professional against amateur ! Wow ! " One day we entertained the great Joe Choynski , from whom I got a boxing lesson and a timely tip . Joe stopped over in Louisville on his way home to Chicago from Galveston , Texas , where he had knocked out Jack Johnson . I told him I was worried about my weight ; for in spite of five to eight miles of roadwork before breakfast and an hour 's drill each afternoon I was still too heavy . When I did melt off a pound or two , just a light meal or even a glass of water put them right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds , " said Choynski . " How do you dry out ? " I asked . " Take no liquid for two or three days before a fight . You get hellish thirsty . Gargle with cold water . " Joe had just been released from jail at Galveston where he and Jack Johnson served thirty days for prize fighting . But the sheriff treated Joe as a guest , gave him a comfortable bed and good food and even permitted him to go out at night . " What about Jack Johnson ? " I asked . " They 're kind of tough on darkies in the South , " smiled Joe . " They kept him in a dungeon on bread and water . " One day when Screw Sanders called he brought had news . City and State officials had turned thumbs down on the fight . Kentucky 's Negro population had got steamed up , and the police feared race excitement ; they would not permit a meeting between black and white . " But do n't stop training , " admonished Sanders . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so they did . Plans of the promoters were closely guarded . Even the principals did n't know where they were to meet until four hours before they entered the ring . About dusk on the day of the fight I got word to be at the river front at eight o'clock . There I found a swarm of tugboats and other small river craft . One by one as the boats filled they chugged upstream in the darkness , and passengers were permitted to knowtheir destination was Six-Mile Island . ( Six miles above Louisville . ) As I stood in the gloom of the levee watching the crowd troop aboard the boats , a slim figure in a long gray overcoat appeared beside me , and a small , soft hand grasped my fingers . A girl I She wore a felt hat pulled down over her hair and her coat collar was turned up to hide part of her face . " Please do n't give me away , " she said . " I 'm crazy to see the fight and to root for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on his clothes . Wo n't you take me with you ? " Through her disguise I recognized a beautiful blonde girl often noticed in Louisville ! I handed her a small satchel containing my fighting equipment and she followed me aboard my tug . III Soon I was sitting in my ring corner . One end of the mile-Iong island in the Ohio River swarmed with hilarious sports from the city . A roped arena had been set up in a sandy clearing encircled by scraggly trees , from the branches of which hung kerosene reflector lamps that split the dark with a weird yellow glare . On my left , pressing against the ropes , white spectators eyed me appraisingly as an upstart amateur . Members of the Pendennis Club , young men of wealth and fashion , judges , physicians , bankers , and politicians stood cheek-by-jowl with gamblers , bartenders , thieves , and streetwalkers . Almost close enough to touch , Young E. Allison , composer of the American opera , " The Ogallalahs , " chatted with the Democratic boss , John Whallen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked arms with cartoonist Paul Plaschke ; Thompson Buchanan , the young playwright , was discussing the fight with Will S. Hays , who wrote that popular ballad of the seventies , " Mollie Darling . " At the right of the ring Negroes grinned and chattered , and awaited a triumph of black over white . Most of the crowd stood , the only available seats being half a hundred deck chairs and benches dragged from the waiting tugs . A score of youths had climbed to lower limbs of trees and hung there like monkeys in a zoo . I had stripped in a crisp breeze that blustered from the river . Though I had been nervous and fidgety at first , I found myself surprisingly at ease after I stepped through the ropes . The bell clanged , and I whirled into a struggle , the ferocity of which remains vivid after forty years . After the first round , the ring surface was so scuffed that we fought ankle-deep in sand , and all my patiently mastered footwork availed naught . A dogfight it had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It Tasted the full twenty rounds . Here is a part of the description of it in the Courier-journal of September 18 , 1897 , written in the characteristic fight-reporting style of the day : . In the eleventh and twelfth rounds Crosby seemed to have the better of the argument , because it was plain to all that he landed with greater force than did his antagonist . At times Rucker looked weak and a little dazed , but he invariably came up smiling and fresh . One man offered to bet $10 to $2 that Crosby would win , and his offer was snapped up so readily that he backed down . Later he offered to bet $10 to $8 and was accepted . Then came the unlucky thirteenth round ? unlucky , as the sports said , because Crosby had evidently received instructions to finish his man as quickly as possible . It is all over his face as he stands there in a gravely-quiet crowd , under the light of the kerosene lamps . Rucker 's seconds have evidently told him to play a waiting game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exchanged , then from somewhere out of the dusky body comes a chocolate-colored fist , which lands heavily on Rucker 's chin . The pink body flops against the loose ropes and springs back again to meet another dusky fist , which finds a resting place against the ear , and the nineteen-year-old boy drops to his knees . " He is out , he is out , " cry his friends and they groan and shower curses on the entire African race . But Rucker is game to the core . He rises slowly on one knee and then by great effort he pulls its companion up also . Bang , and the chocolate fist again collides with the pink and white ear and again the young athlete sprawls in the deep sand . Down there to the left where the kerosene lamp is dying out a broad-shouldered man pushes his way through the ropes , knocking down several of the howling spectators and declares that the fight shall be given to Rucker on a foul . Half a dozen of his companions yank him back through the ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensified and the referee has seen no foul . Once , twice , four times Rucker goes to the sand from the effect of those awful swings . The fight will be over in the next punch . But no , a dozen men have yelled , " Call time , " and mistaking the call for the time-keeper 's call , Crosby returns to his corner , and ten seconds of precious time arc lost to him . Rucker 's seconds take advantage of this short time and spurt pints of water on his bleeding face and polka-dotted body . When he finally resumes his position he is hardly able to stand , but Crosby has not the reserve strength to put over the finishing blow . Back and forth the crowd surges , howling like demons ? Crosby calm , silent , smiling ; Rucker pale , blood-bcspecked , but game . The gong stops Crosby 's vicious rush and the crowd yells its satisfaction at the close of the round with Rucker still standing . It is a Rucker crowd , there is no doubt of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hundreds of monosyllabic advices thrown to Rucker . Then they come up again . It is the fourteenth round and each succeeding round to the end is exactly like it except the last . Rucker spurred on by the cheers of his associates , makes a few charges which are almost impossible to withstand . He essays right and left swings in the face , gets innumerable punches in the ribs , but finally lands a rib roaster which makes the colored man 's teeth chatter . They fight like beasts . " Bang " they go at each other , and " bang , " they collide like a couple of steam engines . The spectators have never witnessed such a fight before . Amid the babel of voices the referee orders them to quit and makes them shake hands , and then turns to the howling mob with uplifted hands and says : " Gentlemen , this is the best fight I have ever seen . I declare it a draw . " Then the crowd gives one long cheer and scrambles down the banks to the wheezy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real story of that thirteenth round , or of the fight as a whole , is not found in the Courier-Journal report . The " broad-shouldered man who pushed through the ropes " was one of my seconds , a medical student , John Glover South , who in later life became United States Minister to Panama and to Portugal , and President of the Kentucky State Board of Health . I had another second named James Frew , then physical director of the Louisville Athletic Club , later a physician in Milwaukee . Both South and Frew were famous football players of the nineties , big fellows and superb athletes . A few days before the fight South and Frew had called at my training camp asking permission to try on me a scientific experiment . " If you should get hurt , " explained South , showing me a pill-box of amber-colored pellets , " we want to smash one of these under your nose . They 're nitrate of amyl pearls , and they 'll almost revive a corpse . If you get dazed they will set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along just in case , " said Frew . Up to the thirteenth round Crosby had not hit me effectively . Despite the soft sand underfoot , I had tied him up by ducking and blocking and he was beginning to tire . Enraged at his inability to solve my defense , he wrestled me against the ropes . What terrible strength he had ! As we came out of that clinch he shot a hook to my jaw . We had agreed to break clean , and it was an obvious foul . Down I crashed in the sand . What actually happened from then until the close of the round I ca n't say of my own knowledge . I thought I was hurtling through limitless space in a thick mist . I learned later that I was knocked down half a dozen times by sledgehammer swings , and was led to my corner , out on my feet . But suddenly the fog lifted and the ring stopped whirling . South was holding a towel under my nose and begging me to breathe deep . In the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish me had tired him , and he was beginning to feel the incessant body-pounding I was giving him . Whether the nitrate of amyl saved me I ca n't say . I have never heard of any other fighter using it . But I know that I got through the last six rounds , during which I felt Crosby 's gorilla strength steadily ebbing . That spectacular fight on Six-Mile Island was more than a nine days ' sensation in Kentucky and Indiana . It was argued angrily , and partisans punched noses . Regardless of diverse opinions , that battle was for me a marvelous , indeed a miraculous , experience . Can you conceive what it means to fight twenty rounds ? One hour and nineteen minutes of physical strain even if you do n't get hit ! I had shown endurance worthy of a champion , had stood up under severe punishment , and had finished stronger than a seasoned professional -- I who had been an invalid only two years be-fore ! As I dressed after the fight a gaunt , be-whiskered gaffer , steeped in corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered his hand . In the other he gripped a long rifle . " Rucker , " he said , " I want to shake your hand . When I seen that nigger foul you I went home and got the old squirrel gun . I been livin ' on this here island more'n twenty years . If that ape had'a tried that agin I sho ' would'a put him out'n his misery . Come purty nigh lettin ' him have it anyhow . " I learned later that the old fellow actually attempted to sight his rifle at Crosby , but bystanders held him back . Mind you , the chances of my getting hit instead of Crosby were one in two ! As I moved to the waiting tug for the return trip to Louisville the girl in man 's clothes caught up with me and took my hand . " It was thrilling , " she said . " I would n't have missed it for worlds . But I almost fainted when you were knocked down . How did you ever pull through ? Are you hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had never felt better in my life . On the boat ride she held my hand and it seemed as though we had known each other always ? though 1 did n't guess then that she was to become my wife . IV The thrill of the game , I must confess , was getting into my blood despite my qualms about professional fighting . It seemed that everyone was trying to do me a favor . I was on the inside of every phase of Louisville activity . Even youths of the oldest and wealthiest families sought me and were actually flattered if I called them by name . I had more social invitations than I could accept . Then too I had developed a love of combat . Nevertheless , I would have kept my resolution to quit the game after the Crosby fight but for the unfavorable conditions under which I had fought , and the unsatisfactory outcome . So when promoters proposed a second meeting I decided to fight just once more . Again the State and city authorities , fearing race disturbances , turned thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheme had to be devised to outwit the law . Promoting the match became a game of wits , and the Louisville sporting public looked on with amused Curiosity . Again I had no inkling where the fight would be held until a few hours before ring time , when I got word to be at the Southern Railroad station at eight o'clock . A special train took us all out to a picnic place in Crossroads . Again Crosby and I slashed through twenty rounds , but this time I had a firm footing . I could slide about , in and out , to out-speed the rugged Negro . At the finish I did not have a mark , while Crosby was leg-weary and battered . I felt chesty that I had marked up Crosby more than had Joe Gans . The special train , waiting on a siding , filled quickly and steamed back toward Louisville . A carnival-minded crowd sang , laughed , drank , shouted scabrous repartee . Friends swaying through the aisle paused to offer tipsy congratulations . Presently I heard a staccato voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? you and sue ? " Turning , I saw behind me Charley Poretto , one of Louisville 's Italian colony , a Swart , garish , ribald tout , who talked out of the side of his mouth . " I got a bankroll ? enough for a getaway . We 'll have more fun than a barrel of monkeys and pick up some coin . You need experience ? knockin ' over bums . I be manager ; I keep you busy . Fight every week ? maybe every night ? what th ' hell ! A few months bumpin ' off chumps and you 're a champ . Then we go after Gans . " A barnstorming trip ! Well , why not ? Serious life would begin soon enough . Was n't I entitled to a frolic one final fling ? And so I acquired a manager . ( Poretto in later years became a plainclothes detective of the New Orleans police department . ) " We got ta grab a ring monicker , " said Poretto next day . " Ed Rucker ai n't no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God in ' em . " " How about Frankenstein ? " I asked . " Or Genghis Khan ? " " Nuts ! Jew names ai n't no good . It 's got ta be Irish . " " Well , how 's Hogan ? " I ventured , recalling " Hogan 's Alley , " a show then popular in the ten-twenty-thirty theaters . " A swell start ? but you got ta glom something to it . Ring stuff ! " " I have it , " I said . " One-Round Hogan ! " " That 's the answer ! One-Round Hogan ! Great That 'll floor ' em . " And so I became One-Round Hogan on tour . That title was used by a dozen others in the next decade , but I was its originator . Poretto made good his promise to keep me busy . Throughout the next five months I was training and fighting continually in Kentucky , Ohio , West Virginia , and Pennsylvania . After each fight Poretto would disappear and wire news of another match . The foes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but luckily for me they were nearly all what the profession calls stumblebums , and I usually lived up to my ring name by bouncing them out in the first round . What with fighting twice a week though , my hands finally cracked , and there came a time when the punches I threw hurt me more than the heads they hit . In Philadelphia I was offered a match with tough Owen Ziegler , who would have had even more trouble than I to make the lightweight limit . But I decided to return home , hang up the gloves , and try to get on a Louisville paper as cub reporter . I bought a set of Chambers ' Encyclopedia , and started at volume one siphoning knowledge into my head . I haunted newspaper offices begging a job . But city editors , though affable , were wary , probably thinking me punch-drunk , and I had no luck . V Some time later , lightweight champion George ( " Kid " ) Lavigne came to the Buckingham Theater headlining a burlesque show . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Billy . He sent me an invitation backstage , where in his dressing room I found him naked , chatting with his manager , Sam Fitzpatrick , and reporters . He had recently returned from England where he had defeated Dick Burge , the British " Iron Man . " The dressing-room door swung open and in walked the theater owner , Col. John Whallen , political boss of Louisville . Large and heavy , he was surprisingly quick of movement , always smoked a cigar , and wore a tilted plug hat as a kingly crown . He was a self-made man , an adroit and confident political leader , a feudal chieftain , feared and respected . As a political potentate he was the prototype of Jim Farley . After greeting Lavigne , Col. Whallen said to me , " How about boxing the champ Friday night ? Give you two hundred dollars . Four rounds . " I needed money . The proceeds of my late barnstorming were spent . Besides it was a royal honor for a youngster to be addressed by Boss Whallen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how we should box , but I well knew that though the bout would be called an exhibition , I should have to guard my chin as best I might . It never occurred to me that I might not last four rounds . The Buckingham Theater was jammed on Friday night and a huge overflow crowd clogged all the entrances . I had to fight my way through the rear alley to the stage door . Having put on my ring attire in a below-stage dressing room , I went up to watch a thumping musical finale . Among the troupers were the singer Emma Carus and the comedian George Sydney . Emma Carus and Helena Mora were rival female baritones of the nineties . What a shock I got when Emma , in purple tights , walked off stage after a song , cursing the orchestra accompaniment , " It 's too damn low ! " A few minutes later , in different mood , she strolled over to the wings , where I chatted with Sydney , and said , " Are you the kid who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of an actress in makeup ? mascaraed eyes , rouged cheeks , and carmined lips ? and she seemed positively coruscating . " Doing anything after the show ? " she asked . Before I could answer she said , " How about chop suey at some Chink joint ? " Flattered that Miss Carus should show interest in a colt like me , I said quickly , " Of course ; I 'd be glad to . " But her upholstered form made me wonder that she thought of food . " I 'm at the Louisville Hotel , " she said . " I 'll go home after the show . " " I never tasted chop suey , " I confessed . " I thought Chinese ate rats . " " You poor kid , " she laughed . A few minutes later I sat facing Lavigne . In the wings , standing on props and chairs , or perched on ladders , members of the troupe , painted chorus girls , slapstick comedians , tumblers , clowns , singers , and dancers focused on me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should remain vertical . As for me , I felt intense curiosity to know what it would be like to be boxing the great Lavigne . Before the champion 's iron-fisted advance I slid away . I wanted time to study his method . Never had I so desperately needed defensive skill . Weighted gloves thudded against my elbows and shoulders or grazed my head in ominous warning . A thumping right belted my ribs like the kick of a mule . Lavigne tried to pin me in a corner , but as he charged I sidestepped , and he hurtled by into the ropes . I had made the champion miss by a foot ! Amazingly fast , Lavigne bounded after me as I glided about , ducking or sidestepping hooks that flicked my ears . Round and round the ropes we whirled . All the time I was gaining confidence . After all , I thought , Lavigne was a human being and had no more fists than I. On his next rush I stepped inside his swing instead of pulling back , and tried a left jab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath Lavigne 's mouth . At the close of the first round I felt cocky and I was sure that Lavigne would not reach me effectively in a short bout . As the second round got under way I saw that Lavigne had changed pace . Seeing I had a canny defense , he hoped to set a trap by easing off , make me careless so that he might drop me with one mighty blow . I resolved not to get caught . Coming out of clinches I lowered my hands to give the impression of recklessness , then I began to lead , banging away with lefts and rights . Some of these punches I knew Lavigne could have ducked or blocked . Each time I led I kept my eyes open and my mind taut . I felt there was peril ahead . We pounded through fiery flurries that stirred the customers to frenzy . My friends thought I was making a great showing and they cheered madly . But toward the close of the second round Lavigne suddenly bent back and rocketed a whistling right . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best I could do was to jerk in my chin . Lavigne 's fist crashed against my nose and spread it across my face . A thick stream of blood flowed down my chest . Staggering back with knees buckling , I barely managed to keep my feet as Lavigne raged after me . But to my own amazement I recovered full strength almost instantly . Indeed I felt a sudden new speed and power and I was strangely unafraid . I slugged back , finding myself indifferent to the champion 's blows . I no longer felt them . Now Lavigne was bleeding too . The crowd roared excitedly as men stood on seats and flung hats in the air . When the bell rang neither Lavigne nor I heard it , and the referee had to step between us . We lashed into the next round , both of us throwing leather with everything we had , both smeared with blood . I felt light as a toy balloon and sped about without effort , my left pumping away like a machine gun . Lavigne volleyed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I managed to evade . We surged wildly around the ropes until the final bell . When we shook hands at the finish Lavigne draped an arm round my neck and said , " You 're all right , Ed . See you in the bar . " Cleaned up finally and dressed , I climbed to a darkened stage . There I met one of the chorus girls , billed as Nadine . " Hello , kid , " she cooed . " You went great . Gawd am I dry ! " " Come along , sister , " I said . Roisterers jammed the Theater bar , performers , newspaper men , gamblers , boxers , jockeys , and show girls . I sat at a table with Lavigne , his manager and brother and Bill Douglas , sports editor of the Courier-Journal , with Nadine beside me . To my amazement Lavigne ordered whiskey straight and tossed off three fingers at one gulp . " Set ' em up again , " he bawled . How many drinks the champion downed that night I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to compromise on ginger ale , but when I saw the scorn on the frolickers ' faces , I said , " Gim me whiskey . " I marvelled that a great champion should drink hard liquor . How was it possible , I wondered , for him to have such stamina ? The answer was that Lavigne 's constitution even then was being eroded , and he was on his way downhill . Soon the liquor had my head spinning . Nadine 's arm was round my neck , I had forgotten Emma Carus . Life was gaudy and devoid of care . About three o'clock Lavigne invited the party to his hotel . Into hacks we piled and clattered around to the Galt House . In a big suite more drinks were ordered for the crowd . Presently we were singing , " After the Ball . " Lavigne 's girl , eager to display her pretty knees , tried to kick the chandelier . We became more and more boisterous . Someone lurched against a tray of drinks and it crashed to the floor . We sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A tap sounded on the door . Fitzpatrick stepped into the hall and a moment later beckoned to me . Our caller was the night clerk , red-haired Dave Flynn . " Ed , " he said apologetically , " there 's an old lady dying across the hall . Her nurse telephoned begging us to stop the noise . I 'm sorry . " " I 'll quiet ' em , " said Fitzpatrick . Not long after that I must have passed out . The next I knew I lay on a divan , feeling seasick . " What time is it ? " I asked . " Noon , " said Nadine . " I 've missed rehearsal . " Sam Fitzpatrick yelled , " First call for breakfast , " but the mere thought of food made me groan . But after a cold plunge in Lavigne 's tub I joined the party and managed to down a few swallows of black coffee . While the breakfast dishes were being cleared away Dave Flynn came up . " I want to thank you boys for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How different the attitude of hotel clerks may be to special guests ! " How 's the sick lady ? " I asked . " Cashed in an hour ago , " said Flynn . " A funny old dame . Used to be a famous looker . When her youth faded , she tried to beat old age . Went to Paris , had her face enameled . They say it looked good for a coupla years . Then the enamel wrinkled . She moved to the Galt House and never left her room . No callers ever received ? just a nurse with her . Everything handled by correspondence ? always used lavender stationery sealed with wax . She was nuts about lavender . " " What 's her name ? " I asked , although I knew . " Sallie Ward Downes , " said Flynn . That name had been famous in Louisville . VI At last I got a newspaper job , on the Commercial , and my first assignment was to box Jim Corbett at his training camp at West Baden Springs , and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Jim Corbett in his shirtsleeves , sitting on a bed at the West Baden Springs hotel stuffing cotton between his toes . " Too much road work , " he said . " Puppies whining . " His shirt had large checkered stripes which I thought becoming to his Praxitelean figure . How the ancient Greeks would have acclaimed him ! Thirty-two years old , past his athletic zenith , he nevertheless seemed to have kept all the fire of youth . " Boxing any ? " I asked , trying to be casual . " Got ta get limbered up and boiled out first , " he said . " I 've been loafing too long ? and eating . " " Mr. Corbett , " I ventured , " the Louisville Commercial sent me to West Baden on an assignment to box with you and write my experiences ? if I survive . I 'm a pretty fair boxer myself ? and a pal of Tom Lansing . Would you ? " " If you promise to go easy with the old cripple , " joshed Corbett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's Lansing ? Had him with me all summer at Asbury Park . And , say , there 's no Mister Corbett around here ? unless it 's Tom . " He meant his brother Tom Corbett who sat up in a window reading a pink weekly . While the gloves were being tied for our bout , Corbett puffed out his chest , spread-eagled his shoulders , and roared : " Behold El-Cap-i-tan , Gaze on his form from feet to hair , See in his eyes that fearful glare , Compare him if you can . " Great show that , " he said . " Sousa music ? Hopper clowning . That Hopper woulda made a fighter . Big and fast and strong ? can backflip like a circus acrobat . " Turning to me , he said jokingly , " Made your will , son ? " " Ever hear of David and Goliath ? " I retorted . " I know Weber and Fields , " smiled Corbett . " Different circuits , " yelled Blunt . A moment later we were sparring , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that against Jim 's superior height and reach I should have to crowd after him as long as I was upright , and take the consequences . After all , I was twelve years younger , in fine condition , battle-hardened , and as cocky as the devil on horseback . In thirteen months I had fought nearly two hundred rounds . Corbett had fought only twice in six years , a total of seventeen rounds . Here certainly was exciting experience in full measure : I was boxing a genius of the ring who anticipated every lead , who always had a cushioning elbow or glove under a blow , who slid about , or ducked , or led with blinding speed . Nevertheless I bored in and kept Corbett moving . When Bill Blunt called time , Jim was blowing and sweating . Of course hewas just getting a work-out -- so far at least . In the second round we were both warmed up . I managed to shoot a left to his elusive head , and a smacking right to his ribs . " Good work , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " See in hiseyes that fearful glare ? " and sent me spinning with a quick left . I came right back , however , throwing gloves . So far Corbett had pulled his punches . But now he saw that I could box and that I could take it , and there was a purposeful look in his dark eyes as we slashed into the final session . Suddenly he raked my ribs with a hook , feinted for the same spot , rocketed left and right to head . Those whams had jolt enough to toll the distant bells ; I crashed against a side wall , bounded back into the fire . " Never lead with your chin , " admonished Bill Blunt . I began heaving rights for his head , but the dark pompadour always bobbed away . If I could right-hand him just one time , I might shift and sink a left in the belly . But it was impossible to catch Jim Corbett with a high right . I should have remembered that even Fitzsimmons had failed to do that . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was clowning . But I snapped a fast left hook and it Landed solidly . I knew that for a moment it made Jim see bright lights . " Kid 's fast , " grunted Corbett ? and now he showed speed that was bewildering . Still partly pulling punches , he swarmed all over me . Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! My turn to see lights . Bang ! Bang ! Gloves thudded against head and ribs . That dazzling Corbett footwork I now saw at close range , just as it must have looked to John L. Sullivan . No wonder the mighty John L. was fuddled ! In and out Jim darted , feinting , ducking , snapping hooks . How could a heavyweight move so fast ? Bang ! A straight right . Again I went against the wall and again I rebounded . " I bet that made his false teeth ache ! " wailed Blunt . Suppose Jim forgets I 'm a welterweight , I thought . But I was there to do or die and to record my experience . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Corbett had become a crazy , whirling dervish . I could only counter . I was still trying to figure out a way to reach him when Bill Blunt called time . A few moments later Jim Corbett and I relaxed in a steam bath . As I stood rubbing salt on my skin I noticed him eyeing the old scars . " Kentucky feud ? " he asked . I told the story of my cure ; he listened attentively . " Exercise , " he said , " is the nearest thing to a cure-all . Half of human illness would disappear quickly if everybody exercised sanely . And the other half if we stopped wearing clothes . Nature never meant us to put on clothes . " Jim massaged his thighs . " You were smart to quit , " he said . " Look at the punch-drunk ghosts yapping around gyms . Most fighters are catchers and get beat up until they are balmy . Manyare killed . The human head and kidneys were never meant to stand the pounding they get in the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a head ? but the cleverest ca n't miss ' em all . Believe me , I 'm going to quit . I 'm an actor now . I 'm fighting Sharkey just to get another crack at Fitzsimmons . He beat me with a crazy fluke . I 'll take back the title and retire as champion . " " You 've got plenty of work ahead , " I warned . " They say Sharkey is rough , and makes his own rules . " Jim smiled . " Sure , I need work , " he conceded . " God , what /lye been through since I fought Sullivan ! I was in marvelous shape that night . Could have turned right around and fought him all over . Show business ! Gay life ! Women ! Women ! Women ! Nobody will ever know . " That evening when I went to say good-by , Corbett gave me a gold watch with a gilt face , the first watch I had ever owned . The next day I sat before a typewriter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my bout with Jim Corbett . I was a newspaper man at last !
