In the dovetailing corners of Kansas , Missouri and Oklahoma lie the richest lead and zinc beds in the U. S. There a score of " TriState " towns house 100,000 miners and their families . Typical is Zincville in Ottawa County , Okla . Its battered shacks , pieced together out of tar paper and packing cases , nestle close to glittering mountains of " chat , " or quartz dust , the " offal of the mines . " On blustery days , wind whips and swirls the stinging quartz dust through the streets and into the houses . Constant inhalation of quartz dust causes silicosis . <P> Two years ago , shocked into action by the silicosis scandal of Gauley Bridge , W. Va. * ( TIME , Feb. 3 , 1936 ) , the National Committee for People 's Rights ( founded by Theodore Dreiser in 1931 , supported by contributions from such literati as Louis Adamic , Hamilton Basso , John Chamberlain , Waldo Frank ) sent a committee to Tri-State to study the health of the miners . Among the committee members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esther Lucile Brown of the Russell Sage Foundation , Dr. Adelaide Helen Ross Smith , Manhattan silicosis expert , Socialite Sheldon Dick , Manhattan photographer . <P> This week in Manhattan the committee issued a dismally illustrated " Preliminary Report . " It was promptly denounced by Secretary Evan Just of the Tri-State Zinc &; Lead Ore Producers Association as " damned blackmail . " The report contains no harrowing Gauley Bridge tales of mass burials and walking skeletons . It offers only Government statistics , a short medical treatise on silicosis , eyewitness accounts of Tri-State life . What distinguishes the committee 's report from most of the 50-odd other silicosis reports which have come out in the last 20 years is the fact that it treats silicosis not as a disease of miners alone but as a public-health menace which indirectly lays low the miners ' women &; children . <P> Significant facts : <P> &gt; The tiny silica or quartz particles which cause silicosis are about 3/25,000 of an inch in size . They irritate the lungs , cause formation of small , stony nodules , which bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chest . Silicosis alone is not serious , painful or disabling . Essentially it is just a case of dirty lungs . But silicotics are extraordinarily susceptible to tuberculosis , frequently die from it . Dust from " chat " piles , according to the Kansas State Board of Health , is a potential menace to all Tri-State inhabitants . Only ways to prevent silicosis in the mines are to wet down the " working faces " and muck piles of zinc , ventilate the mines with fresh air , provide gas masks for the miners . Since the U. S. Bureau of Mines made a special study of the Tri-State sore spot 25 years ago , the report admits , the better mining companies have done much to improve silicosis precautions . But " wetting down , " particularly in smaller mines , is not enforced , and gas masks are too uncomfortable for daily use . In 1927 a " model " silicosis clinic was established at Picher , Okla. , but clinic doctors could merely make diagnoses and statistical surveys , offer no treatment for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
