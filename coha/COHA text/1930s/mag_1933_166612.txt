Young though it is among the arts , sciences and sports , aviation already has its own vocabulary , traditions , legends and songs . Pilots ' slang and customs are fairly familiar to fiction readers and cinemaddicts . But songs of flying , unlike cowboys ' and sailors ' songs , have never been collected in print . In the May-June issue of Sportsman Pilot , out last week , appeared the beginning of an anthology of flying songs . First contributions came from John C. Haddock , Pennsylvania mining engineer and sportsman pilot . Pilot Haddock recalled a chantey by which student aviators in the Navy were taught the rudiments of safe flying , each verse pointing a moral . Excerpts : <P> They picked his engine off his neck , His prop from out his belly-o . They sewed him in his uniform , And sent him home to Nelly-o , Crashed plumb to jelly-o- Do n't lose your flying speed ! He did a bank at ninety feet , It was a kinda foolish thing , And now he is the devil 's meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try to get some altitude ! He kicked his rudder right around , When landing cross wind to the breeze , And much to his surprise he found , He had an engine on his knees- Land ' em straight and land up slow !
