Fortnight ago the Berlin Nazi-controlled newsorgan Lokalanzeiger called former British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , now Lord Baldwin , a " guttersnipe . " Nazis were vexed because Lord Baldwin , in appealing for contributions to a help-the-refugees fund , had condemned Germany 's persecutions of Jews . <P> Many other British statesmen have been called just as bad or worse in the German press ( notably Winston Churchill , Anthony Eden , Alfred Duff Cooper ) , but last week Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain , Lord Baldwin 's successor , decided to defend his old Cabinet colleague . Invited to deliver the main speech at the 50th anniversary dinner of London 's Foreign Press Association , which includes in its membership German as well as U. S. , French , Italian , Polish , Latin American correspondents , Mr. Chamberlain , in preparing his speech , inserted amidst paragraphs of amiable generalities one moderate sentence of criticism : <P> " I must deplore the recent attitude of the German press , which in one case has not scrupled to pour its vituperation against our most respected statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in few cases has shown much desire to understand our point of view . " <P> Advance copies of Mr. Chamberlain 's speech , marked " confidential , " were given to correspondents ( including the German ) at No. 10 Downing Street at 3 p.m. , five hours before the dinner at distinguished Grosvenor House . At 6 p.m . German Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen , who was to occupy a seat at the speakers ' table , got hold of a copy of the speech , telephoned Berlin . At 7 p.m . Ambassador von Dirksen notified 25 obedient Nazi newsmen not to attend , and telephoned his " regrets " to the association . The Ambassador " felt an embarrassing situation might arise if in the course of the evening mention were made of subjects entailing criticism of German affairs . " <P> By the time the guests-among them British Foreign Secretary Viscount Halifax , Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon , the Ambassadors of Italy , France , Russia , Brazil-had begun to arrive , 50 chairs reserved for the missing Germans had been removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister Chamberlain was heard to exclaim : " How stupid ! " But Mr. Chamberlain made no changes in his speech , got a big hand when he came to the " offending " sentence . <P> Appeaser . To most polite Britons the German boycott was a shocking lapse of manners . To the London press the " banquet incident " loomed bigger than any far-off territorial dispute . But Mr. Chamberlain 's own words at the banquet proved that no question of taste would affect the Prime Minister 's appease-the-dictators policy . Avoiding the use of the word " appeasement , " a term no longer very popular in England , Mr. Chamberlain said he would continue to make a " prolonged and determined effort to eradicate possible causes of war and to try out methods of personal contact and discussion . " Dictatorships do not last forever , the Prime Minister hinted , and " attempts at domination are never long successful . "
