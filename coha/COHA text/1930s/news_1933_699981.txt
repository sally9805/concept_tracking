txt General John F. O'Rya.n will withdraw his name from consideration as the fusion candidate for Mayor unless the members of the Republican Mayoralty committee , meeting today , support him with " convincing unanimity . " General O'Ryan made that declaration yesterday in a letter to W. Kingsland Macy , Republican State chairman , after Mr. Macy earlier in the day had asked him to withdraw so that the anti-Tammany forces would not be divided . Leaders opposed to General O'Ryan 's nomination construed his statement as a graceful withdrawal . Neither they nor others were optimistic about unanimity if the issue of General O'Ryan 's candidacy is to be settled within the ranks of the Mayoralty committee , 300 in number . " Get-Together " Started . However , yesterday afternoon , just as the situation seemed hopelessly muddled , a small group of leaders representing nearly all the elements started a " get-together " movement , the effect of which would be to put the control of thei fusion movement in the hands of a smaller group , more independent I of organization politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president ( of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York , and included A. A. Berle Jr. , a member of President Roosevelt 's " brain trust " ; Maurice P. Davidson of the City party , James E. Finegan of the same group , Robert McC . Marsh , an anti-Koenig Republican ; New- bold Morris , president of the Fifteenth A. D. Republican Club ; J. G. Louis Molloy , one of Samuel Seabury 's assistants in the city investigation and head of the Knickerbocker Democrats , and Joseph M. Price of the Independent Fusion Committee . Mr. Burlingham , in a letter to Charles S. Whitman , chairman of the Republican Mayoralty Committee , invited him to name a small group to confer with the new cornI mittee before the meeting of the I Republican mayoralty committee / today . Seek to End Discord . The purpose of the new group is to end as soon as possible the discord that has existed since the O'Ryan nomination . In that , the committee is understood to have the approval or Samuel Seabury . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to General O'Ryan , laid down the rule that the candidate who is picked must be one who can get the wholehearted support of Mr. Seabury . Friends of Mr. Seabury , however , were quick to disclaim any intention on his part to adopt a " rule or ruin " policy in connection with the nomination . While he favors the nomination of former Representative F. II . La Guardia , he has not barred the door to any other candidate , such as former Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby , who is under consideration . Judge Seabury confirmed the report of his attitude toward Mr. Colby yesterday , when , commenting on reports that Colby was a likely candidate , he said : " Colby is a man who could win and give New York City the kind of government it needs . " Fusionists " In a Stew . " Prior to the news of the formatipn of the new fusion committee , one leader admitted that the fusionist camp was " in a stew , " with its members apparently holding conferences and getting no place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barstow Smull of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York that Adrian Van Sinderen , Brooklyn banker and philanthropist , had been picked for Controller at a conference on Tuesday at the City Club . Mr. Van Sinderen accepted yesterday , Mr. Smuti said , reserving , however , the right to decline in the event that General O'Ryan declines the Mayoralty nomination . The meeting of the Republican Mayoralty committee will be held at 4 o'clock this afternoon at the National Republican Club . It will be preceded , if the original schedule is followed , by a meeting of the executive committee of the Mayoralty committee . The formation of the new committee may result in a change of plans . Text of Macy 's Letter . The letter sent by Mr. Macy to General O'Ryan was the first act of the Republican State chairman after he returned to the city from a fishing trip . The letter , follows : My Dear General O'Ryan : I believe that personally you are in favor of unity of action against Tammany Hall in the coming contest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated beyond debate that , your candidacy can not receive the support of those who are sincerely interested in the defeat of Tammany . Your continuance in the field can only serve to divide the anti-Tammany forces and thus aid the success of Tammany ... The opposition expressed to your selection in the public press and by individuals whose support is necessary to success , demonstrates that your continuance in the field can serve only to divide the opposition to Tammany Hall . I earnestly urge you , therefore , in the interest of the cause of good government , to take a large and generous view of the present situation , to withdraw , and thus make it possible that the antiTsmrnsny forces may select a candidate who will unite all elements opposed to Tammany : I should feel the same way if any other candidate was selected who could not unite in this crisis the forces of good government . With respect and regards , I re-main , Faithfully yours , W. KINGSLAND MACY . General O'Ryan 's Reply . General O'Ryan 's reply follows : My dear Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am In complete accord with your statement that unity in action against Tammany Hall in the coming contest is necessary . As you know , I am not a candidate for the Mayoralty nominatidn , nor have I accepted the proposal of any of the fusion elements in regard to the Mayoralty . It may be said , therefore , that I am not in a position to withdraw from a candidacy which I have not accepted . I take it that you mean the withdrawal of my name from consideration as a candidate by the Republican Mayoralty ' Committee . That action , I assure you , would be entirely agreeable to me except that I would be embarrassed by the fact that in my statement yesterday I committed myself to await the action of that committee , which is to meet tomorrow . I am a business man and a lawyer , not a politician . I consented to consider the nomination because it is vital to the people of this city that the control of the city by the Tammany organization be broken , and no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having no alliances , direct or indirect , with the Tammany organization , and holding nothing but disgust for its methods of exploitation , including all their ? ramifications , wherever they may lead , I felt obligated not to turn away from the proposed service without at least hearing and considering the views of responsible fusion committees and leaders . I therefore feel that I must await the result of the meeting tomorrow , and unless the unanimity of its action is convincing to me , I shall decline . Very truly yours . JOHN F. O'RYAN . General O'Ryan , in response to a question . told reporters that he reserved to himself the right to judge whether the unanimity at the meeting was sufficiently convincing . Mr. Molloy , in behalf of the Knickerbocker Democrats , sent a telegram yesterday to Mr. Whitman , Mr. Davidson , Mr. Price and Mr. Smull , urging the withdrawal of General O'Ryan on the ground that there was active opposition to him among independent Democrats. - The Communist party announced its candidates yesterday .
