To the number of those who annually dissent from the awards of the Pulitzer Prize committee ( TIME , May 11 ) were added last week 8 of the 9 Justices of Iowa 's Supreme Court . The gold Pulitzer plaque for the most meritorious public service by a newspaper in 1935 had gone to Iowa 's Editor Verne Marshall and his Cedar Rapids Gazette for having aroused law enforcement officers into a flurry of arrests , leading to indictments and convictions of State officials for various corrupt practices . Day after the Gazette got its plaque the Supreme Court set free 31 officials . Previously State Liquor Commission Chairman Harold M. Cooper had been released from the charge of having knowingly permitted one J. Leroy Farmer " unlawfully to possess liquor . " - Releasing the 31 , the Supreme Court ruled that , among other things , Special Prosecutor Horace Moore Havner had accepted a $700 special fee from the Gazette , which therefore invalidated the grand jury indictments he had obtained against the 31 defendants . <P> In Cedar Rapids crusading Editor Mar shall complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Prosecutor Hav ner has not had a single penny in compensation from any source except the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors . The Pulitzer award is the answer to anyone who interprets the Supreme Court ruling as a vindication of the crowd indicted in Sioux City many months ago ! " <P> Last October the Pulitzer Award Com mittee announced that henceforth no award in journalism or letters would go to the same man twice . On the eve of making this year 's selections public , the Committee changed its mind , stuck to the system followed since the establishment of the prizes 19 years ago . In England Playwright Robert Emmet Sherwood , whose Idiot 's Delight had taken this year 's play prize , declared : " Had not the restrictions which barred former winners been removed , I should have been forced to refuse the prize . . . . " <P> Last August when Harold Davis learned that his Honey in the Horn had won him the $7,500 Harper Novel Prize , his wife was cutting his hair in the patio of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned he did not know what to do . Last week Prizewinner Davis was sound asleep in an antique hotel near shady Lebanon , Tenn. when a Nashville Banner newshawk roused him to tell him Honey in the Horn had won the $1,000 Pulitzer novel award . Yawned Novelist Davis : " Of course I am very happy . " <P> When Mrs. Josephine Sibbald Barber , 30-year-old widow , heard that her late husband Wilfred was the posthumous winner of the award for distinguished foreign correspondence , she was in Manhattan ending the fourth month of her vain search for work . To her , through her husband 's estate , the Pulitzer Committee sent the $500 the Chicago Tribune 's Barber had won by dying on duty in Ethiopia . <P> <P> * Last year TIME incorrectly reported that Chairman Cooper was convicted of illegally disposing of State liquor seals .
