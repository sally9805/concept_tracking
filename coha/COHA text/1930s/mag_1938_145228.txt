Last week Britain 's Ambassador to China , Sir Archibald John Kerr Clark Kerr , set out from Hong Kong to have a talk with Chiang Kaishek . That is not an easy thing to do nowadays . Sir Archibald had to hire an airplane , fly five or six hundred miles inland over a maze of twisting rivers and search out the Generalissimo " somewhere in Hunan Province . " <P> When proper Sir Archibald arrived at Shanghai he would say no more than that he had found Chiang " well-very fit and optimistic-serenely confident of ultimate victory . " What he did not say-and what officials in China 's new capital at Chung-king did say-was that the fit Generalissimo had just talked to the proper Ambassador more plainly than any big Chinese had ever talked to a big Britisher . <P> A month after the Munich agreement Prime Minister Chamberlain got a 345-to-138 vote of confidence from the Commons after outlining his revised foreign policy as follows . Britain must be prepared to accept almost unlimited extension of Germany 's influence in East Europe , Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is room both for Germany and ourselves in the trade " with East Europe , there was room for Britain and Japan in China . " China , " said the Businessman Prime Minister , " can not be developed into a real market without the influx of a great deal of capital , and the fact that so much capital is being destroyed during the war means that even more will have to be introduced after the war is over . It is quite certain that it can not be supplied by Japan . " <P> In other words , over a period of years , British sterling would prove more effective in China than Japanese shrapnel . <P> But Chiang Kai-shek is fighting a war and he has less interest than Mr. Chamberlain in long-range economic ideas about China . The Generalissimo flatly told Ambassador Sir Archibald that the loss of Canton was attributable to China 's misplaced confidence in Britain . <P> Certain that Britain would not tolerate Japanese military operations in the area around the strategic , highly-fortified British Crown Colony of Hong Kong , 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortify the city , left it defended by untrained provincial troops . Japanese commanders decided on the South China campaign only after Britain 's capitulation at Munich convinced them that Britain had no stomach for a dispute in the Far East , Chiang insisted . In fact , Japanese troops were this week within half a mile of the borders of Hong Kong , inside which they accidentally popped a few shells , as Chinese regulars , out to recapture Canton , pushed their front to within 40 miles of the city . <P> Every mile that the Government of China is pushed westward pushes it nearer to Russia . From Russia now come most of the arms and experts that Chiang is using against the Japanese . Some of the best of Chiang 's troops are the Chinese Communist armies . If China wins the war , hinted Chiang last week , to Russia would naturally fall the trade position in China once held by Britain-unless Britain was soon able to match the U. S. S. R. 's friendly handouts . Britain could help China mightily with loans and shipments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's southern campaign .
