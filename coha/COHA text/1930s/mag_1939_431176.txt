 | ONE Sunday morning in April , 1607 , a man and a boy strode briskly along the London street known as Bishopsgate . Pungent smells of fish and pitch and tar floated up from the Thames whence they had come . " A sea captain and his son , " you might have guessed , but you hardly would have suspected either their destination or their destiny . They were bound for the little Church of St. Ethelburga to receive Holy Communion before beginning a dangerous voyage . They probably looked very little like figures of tragedy as they walked along together with head high , each secretly proud of the other . Yet in little more than four years from this day their dreams and voyages were fated to be cut short in icy North American waters by murderous mutineers . In that brief time this seafaring man , with his quiet , hero-worshiping son , was to achieve so much that his name would be written many times on the map of the New World . The captain 's name was Henry Hudson . SAILOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other seafaring men drifting up from the river . But these were cast in coarser mold able-bodied seamen mostly , hairy-chested , scarred , some bearing the marks of a Saturday night 's carousing . This was the crew of Hudson 's ship , and they , too , were bound for church ! To a modern ear their talk would seem strange . They referred to Hudson as " our master . " Though sprinkled with lurid water-front phrases and one-syllable AngloSaxon words , many expressions had a Biblical ring . But that should not be wholly surprising , because at this very time in history the Bible was being translated into the King James Version , which was to preserve and make familiar for centuries the King 's English of the day . A strange sight it must have been to see these seamen kneeling in church ? some genuinely devout , others , coarse-visaged , wearing what they fondly believed to be a convincing mask of piety . An eloquent candid-camera shot that scene would have made . CHURCH STILL STANDS , A HUDSON SHRINE All that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the navigator , his son , and ten seamen taking Communion in the little church , named for a Saxon saint , which still stands in Bishopsgate today , 332 years later ( page 464 ) . The incident is recorded in a log of his voyage based on Hudson 's journal but written by John Pleyce , one of his crew : Anno 1607 , Aprill the nineteenth , at Saint Ethelburge , in Bishops Gate street , did communicate with the rest of the parishioners these persons , seamen , purposing to goe to sea four dayes after , for to discover a passage by the North Pole to Japan and China .

Eightly , John Pleyce . Ninthly , Thomas Baxter . Tenthly , Richard Day . Eleventhly , James Knight . Twelfthly , John Hudson , a boy . At the time Captain Hudson was probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been sailing the seas for many years . He may have been with Davis in the ice-choked waters of Arctic North America some 20 years before . There is reason to believe he had voyaged to the Orient , sailing the long , rough water road around the Cape of Good Hope . Some think he came of a wealthy family , a line of merchant adventurers devoted to foreign trade , and that one of his relatives had been high in the councils of the Muscovy Company , for which he was now to sail . But all this is shadowy , speculative . We do know that the mariner was an Englishman and not a Netherlander , though his most famous voyage ? that in the Half Moon to what is now New York ? was made under the flag of the Netherlands , and his name to this day is often spelled 461  | Hendrick or Hendryk as a result . Actually his name was Henry , as English as mutton , and to talk with his Dutch employers he had to have an interpreter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other children besides the seagoing John , and that he lived in the St. Katherine 's section , hard by the Tower of London and the Thames . Otherwise , the book of his life is an utter blank up to the time of this April morning in 1607 when he leaps full-grown into history , an experienced mariner at the peak of his powers . What Henry Hudson looked like no one knows , though the drama of his career has stirred the imagination of many an artist ( Plate XVI and pages 467 , 475 , 490 ) . " ALWAYS JERKING UP HIS BREECHES " Priceless and immortal but too good to be true is Washington Irving 's description of the navigator in Knickerbocker 's Histon , ' of New York : He was a short , square , brawny old gentleman . with a double chin , a mastiff mouth , and a broad copper nose , which was supposed in those days to have acquired its fiery hue from the constant neighborhood of his tobacco pipe . He wore a true Andrea Ferrara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked hat on one side of his head . He was remarkable for always jerking up his breeches when he gave out his orders , and his voice sounded not unlike the prattling of a tin trumpet -- owing to the number of hard northwesters which he had swallowed in the course of his seafaring . No doubt Hudson knew he would have plenty of hard northwesters to swallow on this particular trip . He was heading for the North Pole ! Like many in his day , he believed that the ice , instead of growing more abundant and impassable. thinned out as you neared the Pole . They reasoned that in a land of midnight sun , where the sun shines day and night for months , it must generate enough heat to melt the ice . A small fire burning constantly , they argued , would keep a room warm more effectively than would a big fire intermittently quenched . SPICES PRIZED WHEN SOAP WAS SCARCE If the theory was correct , Hudson 's little ship , the Hopewell , of 80 tons , would force its way through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world through an open polar sea , then continue down the other side of the globe , past Zipangu ( Japan ) , to the storied coast of Cathay and the warm , pleas-  | ant isles of the Indies where fragrant spices flourished in the tropic sun . The term " spices " included ointments , perfumes , and condiments , in great demand all over Europe . In those days sanitary facilities were crude . Instead of bathing , fine ladies and high-born gentlemen anointed themselves with sweet-smelling perfumes and ointments . Refrigerators were as sadly lacking as bathtubs , and spices were used both for preserving food and for disguising the taste of spoiled or poorly cooked meats . Also , many Europeans , in that pre-gum era , had acquired the habit of chewing cloves . The great need of the day was a short route to the riches of the Orient by Arctic waters of Europe or America . OFF FOR THE NORTH ON MAY DAY This was an age when big things were doing . Adventure and enterprise were in the air . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stalwart soldier of fortune Captain John Smith , was to land with the Virginia colonists at Jamestown and establish the first permanent English  |p465  settlement in all the immense New World . It was May 1 , 1607 , when Hudson 's little ship hoisted anchor at Gravesend in the lower Thames for its voyage to the North Pole and China . Light-hearted children were dancing around Maypoles on the soft green grass of an English spring as the Hopewell ( optimistic name ! ) stood out into the North Sea . Unfortunately there was no Joseph Conrad or Alan Villiers in Hudson 's crew . Terse and tantalizing is that ancient log . " The first of May , 1607 , " it reads , " we wayed anchor at Gravesend , and on Tuesday , the sixe and twentieth day , in the morning , we made the Iles of Shotland . " Twenty-five days of voyaging in 27 words ! But these are known waters . As they venture farther into little-known seas , the details multiply , and out of these simple sentences , like light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes and awestruck fears . " LAND HO ! " In four days , because of contrary winds , the Hopewell covered only a few miles . Soon , however , fresh gales sprang up and the explorers steered away north-northwest with the wild wind screeching in the rigging . Once they saw six or seven whales . On the thirteenth of June , between one and two in the morning , a sailor 's shout rang out . He had sighted land . Though night , it was light in this latitude , and all hands no doubt crowded to the rail . Before them rose " a very high land , most part covered with snow . " Hudson had reached the coast of Greenland . Inhospitable these waters proved . " Our sayle and shroudes did freeze . . . . With much wind wee were hardly able to maintayne a sayle . " Yet this northern land was not wholly without life . " Wee saw much fowle . Also wee saw a whale close by the shoare . " THE LAND OF HOLD-WITH-HOPE Hudson rightly guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part " to any Christian unknowne . " Seemingly endless , it blocked his route toward the Pole and the spicy isles of the East , but in compensation he felt the discoverer 's thrill . He took a proprietary pride in the land , which he described as " very temperate to our feeling . " " And considering wee knew no name given to this land , wee thought good to GNIFICENT FAILURE 465 name it Hold-with-Hope , lying in 73 degrees of latitude . " The quaint name stuck . Cape Hold with Hope and Hudson Land are shown on maps to this day. * At last Hudson tore himself away from this fascinating but forbidding coast and vainly tried to penetrate the barrier of ice which bars the way north between Greenland and Spitsbergen at this time of year . For days the Hopewell played tag with the ice along the coast of Spitsbergen , and time after time she barely escaped . The log is full of pious expressions of thanks for the help of a higher Commander : " It pleased God that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wee gave thankes to God who marvellously preserved us from so many dangers amongst so huge a quantitie of ice and fogge . " Twice when they were caught in a calm and the sea was carrying them toward the grinding , thundering ice , they were saved by an apparent miracle : " It pleased God at the very instant to give us a small gale , which was the meanes of our deliverance ; to Him be praise therefore . " FROM HUDSON TO BYRD Of course he was attempting an impossibility . Three hundred and nineteen years were to elapse before a ship would sail from Spitsbergen to the North Pole , and then it would be a ship of the sky , not the sea ? the Josephine Ford flown by Lieutenant Commander ( now Rear Admiral ) Richard E. Byrd and the late Floyd Bennett.t One thing of major importance Hudson noted : these northern waters seemed alive with whales , one bay in particular . One day , while a seaman was fishing over the side , a whale swam under the keel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reef . There was imminent danger of capsizing , " yet by Gods mercie we had no harme but the losse of the hooke and three parts of the line . " The Hopewell was not equipped for hunting such game , though in her wake would come fleets of whalers to turn the giants into oil for lamps and bone for corset stays . 466 THE NATIONAL 0E01  |p466  As the little vessel was nearing Greenland again , Hudson , noting the icy skie " which marks the presence of wide expanses of ice , saw that no open passage existed around the north of that huge island . Otherwise , he tells us , he would have made his return by the north of Groneland to Davis his Streights , and so for England . " He had no idea that Greenland was as large as it is or extended so far north . But he guessed it was an island something Peary was to prove 293 years later . With this course out of the question , Hudson swung about in the general direction of home . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now called Jan Mayen island . September 15 the weary Hopewell cast anchor at Tilbury in the Thames . Four and a half months of terrific hardship and almost daily risk were over , and what had Hudson to show for it ? Little but negative results . There was no passage to the north of Spitsbergen . There was none to the north of Greenland . For the first time Hudson had proved these facts . No doubt the hard-headed merchant adventurers listened to the skipper with due respect . " Important , doubtless , " they probably said , but purely in the realm of science . The geographers will be glad to know this ? but there is no money in it ! " Yet there were some among the canny London merchants whose thoughts went back to one part of Hudson 's story in particular ? those whales . And many a British fortune was founded , in the years to come , upon the bodies of the sea creatures Hudson had seen unsuspectingly cavorting in the waters to the north . Hudson 's thoughts , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far hotter than even the passion for profits , the discoverers unrelenting urge . Throughout the winter he planned another voyage , one that would try still another door to the icebound citadel of the Arctic . JOHN HUDSON GETS HIS SEA LEGS And what of young " john Hudson , a boy " ? Throughout that entire eventful voyage we hear of him not once . That is hardly surprising . A youngster getting his sea legs ranks little higher than the barnacles under the keel , even if he is the captain 's son . The lad must have done his work well , for when his father persuaded the Muscovy Company to dispatch another expedition the following spring , John 's name was listed as one of the crew minus the probably hated label " boy . " FUTURE PLOTTERS APPEAR Several members of this second crew were destined to be involved in the mutiny that cost Captain Hudson his life three years and two voyages later . Particularly is this true of Robert Juet , of Limehouse , the mate , who became a ringleader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of his master 's right-hand man . This time , having found the ice impenetrable between Greenland and Spitsbergen , Hudson was to try a more eastern door . between Spitsbergen and Novaya Zemlya . By the first of June the little ship again the Hopewell had reached the North Cape of Norway . " It was cleere weather , and we saw Norway fishermen at sea . Fight days later the Hopewell entered the ice . Our hope was to go through it . " For four hours she twisted and dodged , penetrating 12 or 15 miles , but then Hudson decided he had better turn back . " Wee had endangered us somewhat too farre . " A MERMAID IS SIGHTED On a sunshiny morning , June 15 , a fair apparition saluted the Hopewell : " This morning , " says Hudson 's log , " one of our companie looking over boord saw a mermaid , and calling up some of the companie to see her , one more came up , and by that time shee was come close to the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , a sea came and overturned her : from the navill upward , her backe and breasts were like a woman 's , as they say that saw her ; her body as big as one of us : her skin very white ; and long haire hanging downe behinde , of colour blacker in her going downe they saw her tayle , which was like the tayle of a porposse , and speckled like a macrell . Their names that saw her , were Thomas Hilles and Robert Rayner . " Hudson , living in an age when far stranger things than mermaids were being discovered , was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt ! As the ice continued on and on , once again the navigator knew disappointment . " Our hope of passage was gone this way . by meanes of our nearnesse to Nova Zembla and the abundance of ice . " Foiled to the north , Hudson now proposed to try for a northeast passage to the north of Russia , or , if it proved impossible .  |p467  " to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . Not until 1878-1879 was this northeast passage accomplished by Nordenskjold in the sturdy Vega . Hudson next proposed to cross the entire Atlantic to try for a northwest passage instead . But this bold project he was compelled to abandon because of his crew 's fears and contrary winds , and on August 26 the Hopewell again anchored in the Thames . Once more Hudson had to confess himself defeated . Doubtless the lords of the Muscovy Company told the downhearted mariner that they had no more good money to throw after bad . It looked very much as if Captain Hudson would have to stay home for a change . EYES ACROSS THE NORTH SEA But across the North Sea eager , calculating eyes were trained on the doings of the Muscovy Company . The enterprising merchants of Amsterdam had been watching the work of Henry Hudson . " There , " they thought , " is a real explorer , hard-working , fearless , ambitious , thorough , a man well worth engaging . " Amsterdam at this time was a rich and thriving center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the forefront of the world when Henry Hudson strolled its streets in 1609 . Geography , then as now , was the indispensable handmaiden of trade . And even the hard-headed traders of the Dutch East India Company listened with deference to the makers of maps . HUDSON 'S LIFE VALUED AT $80 By the terms of his contract the Englishman was hardly overpaid . The sum to be given him for the support of his wife and children and the purchase of his own personal equipment has been computed as the equivalent of $320 . And if he should not return alive , $80 more was to be paid his widow ? not exactly an exorbitant price to place upon such a life !  |p472  The ship assigned for the expedition was a high-prowed , high-pooped , rather broadbottomed yacht named Halve Maen , or Half Moon ( page 463 ) . The crew was part English , part Dutch . Whether John Hudson was among them nobody knows . The names are not given , but one , of a certainty , was our old friend Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this elderly seaman 's journal that details of that extraordinary voyage have been obtained ; Hudson 's own log has never been found . His orders were plain ? to try to find a passage to India north of Novaya Zemlya . It was April 4 , 1609 , when the little vessel with her polyglot crew cast off at Amsterdam on one of the strangest and most important voyages in the entire story of exploration ( page 470 ) . A month later they had passed the North Cape of Nor way , well above the Arctic Circle . MUTINY AND RIGHT-ABOUT-FACE Then , as fog and ice compassed them about , there arose a muttering among the crew , especially those members who had been sailors in the warm East India service and had never before felt an Arctic blast . Juet , however , makes no mention of mutiny , perhaps because he had a guilty hand in it . Hudson , probably glad of the chance , proposed two plans . Either they might sail to the northwest to explore " Davis his Streights " or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passage to the Orient reported to exist about latitude 40 . Of this mysterious passage Hudson had heard from his friend Captain John Smith .  |p473  To Hudson 's shivering sailors the choice was easy . They wanted no part of Davis Strait . They craved the warmth of the Temperate Zone . Thus , in spite of his ironclad sailing orders , Hudson set off in a direction almost diametrically opposite to that in which he had been hired to go . When nearly across the Atlantic , Hudson 's lookout sighted an unknown vessel hurrying past in the opposite direction . Immediately the Half Moon turned around and for six hours gave futile chase - Juet does not say why . Perhaps some of the seamen would not have been averse to a little profitable piracy . Hudson had probably lost control of his crew , and during the voyage he was often savagely threatened . On the Grand Banks of Newfoundland , even at that early date , Hudson sighted " a great fleet " of French fishermen . Cautiously he approached the North American coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddled out to the ship , " seeming glad of our coming . " One spoke a few words of French . In response to eager questions of goldgreedy sailors , they averred that not only gold but silver and copper were found near by . A SHORE DINNER IN MAINE Next day the Half Moon sailed on " into a very good harbour ' ' ? probably about at Penobscot Bay , in Maine and there some of the men cut a tall tree to replace a mast lost in Atlantic storms . All hands ate lobsters till they could eat no more . Distrust of the natives breathes in Juet 's account , perhaps because his own motives were not of the best . " They offered us no wrong , seeing that we stood upon our guard . They brought many beaver skinnes and other fine furres , which they would have changed for redde gownes . " These peaceful people the crew of the Half Moon soon rewarded in dastardly fashion . First at musket point they stole one of the Indians ' boats . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muskets , and two stone pieces or murderers small cannon , and drave the savages from their houses , and tooke the spoyle of them , as they would have done of us . " Juet added the last phrase , apparently , iiy way of flimsy justification . After this piece of gratuitous savagery they wisely if not very courageously sailed away . Whether Hudson approved the attack is not known , but his own comments on the Indians are far from hostile . On the Massachusetts coast there were friendly Indians , one of whom Hudson entertained at dinner . Later the captain gave him three or four glass buttons and so pleased was the savage that he " leaped and danced " when the ship 's boat set him ashore . These Massachusetts Indians were to be of great help to the Pilgrims when they landed at Plymouth eleven years later . Soon Hudson left the coast , continuing his course southward . By about the middle of August the Half Moon had reached the mouth of Chesapeake Bay . " This is the entrance into the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wrote Juet , referring to Jamestown . About the latitude of Nags Head , North Carolina . Hudson turned and started north again , inspecting the coast more closely . The long finger of Cape May he at first thought to be an island . Continuing up the coast of what is now New Jersey , Hudson noted the low sandy shore punctuated with many small islands . On one of them Atlantic City was to rise , some 250 years later , a metropolis conjured out of a sand bar seven miles at sea . But no beach umbrellas or bathing beauties beckoned the Half Moon on that August day in 1609 . The only sign of life was smoke from a big fire built by Indians . HUDSON ENTERS NEW YORK HARBOR Early in the morning of September 2 the Half Moon 's lookout sighted Sandy Hook . Before him Hudson found " a great lake of water " the Lower Bay of New York Harbor ? and out of this lake or bay flowed " a great streame , " the river that was to bear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it . If the Hudson bore the name of its discoverer it would probably be the Verrazano River or the Gomez River today , for the Italian captain , Giovanni da Verrazano , who sailed this coast 85 years before in the service of France , had beheld its mouth . and so had Estevan Gomez , a Portuguese mariner in the Spanish service , who once had voyaged with Magellan . But Hudson was to make it his river , not theirs , by right of systematic exploration . Undoubtedly he was the first white man to pass the Palisades and the Hudson 478 THE NATIONAL GEO (  |p478  Highlands . Quite possibly he was the first to sail well into the mouth , past the island of Manhattan , towerless then , with virgin forest oaks for skyscrapers ( page 474 ) . This is a very good land to fall with , and a pleasant land to see , " wrote Juet , little thinking that a world metropolis would arise at the mouth of this river . On September 4 , four men were sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first white excursion to Coney Island was a fishing trip , for the landing party caught mullets for the Half Moon 's larder ( page 471 ) . The copper-skinned New Yorkers proved hospitable , though their committee for the reception of distinguished guests was dressed a bit informally in deerskins and beads , not cutaway coats and gardenias . And they greeted their guests with something more substantial than torn-up ticker tape and telephone books . Good tobacco they brought , and Indian corn . Even Juet had to admit they were " very civill , " but darkly he added , " Wee durst not trust them . " FIRST BLOOD IS SHED The very next day his suspicions were borne out when two canoeloads of Indians attacked the ship 's boat , though perhaps the assault was not unprovoked . Rain put out the match with which the muskets were fired , and John Colman , a veteran of Hudson 's first voyage , was killed . An arrow pierced his throat . Next day , when some Indians came out to the ship to trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see whether the visitors would show any guilt . Stoical , they gave no sign , and so were allowed to return in peace . But next morning when two large canoes arrived , one full of braves armed with bows and arrows and the other ostensibly to trade , the Half Moon 's men feared treachery . Panicky , they took two Indians as hostages , but a third escaped by leaping overboard . Either to mock or to mollify their prisoners , the seamen decked them out in bright-red coats . ANCHORED NEAR 42D STREET For several days now the Half Moon had been slowly riding the wind and the tide deeper and deeper into the bay . On September 12 she sailed up into the river and anchored , perhaps near the western end of present-day 42d Street . No Indians were allowed on board , but next day , near the site of Grant 's Tomb , the crew bought " great store of very good oysters " for a few cheap trinkets . That night they anchored near Spuyten Duyvil . On the fourteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the river some 36 miles , past the lofty and inspiring Palisades. to about the level of Peekskill . Later the same day she seems to have reached the neighborhood of Vest Point . The mountains passed were the Hudson Highlands , now looked upon for the first time by the eyes of any white man ( p. 476 ) . Early the next morning the two captive savages squeezed out of a porthole and swam away , whooping scorn and defiance when safe from pursuit . But still as the whites moved up the river they found the Indians uniformly friendly . " Wee found very loving people , and very old men : where we were well used . " Hudson himself has left a description of a visit he paid to the home of an old chief . The natives are a very good people , " he reported , " for when they saw that I would not remain , they supposed that I was afraid of their bows , and taking the arrows , they broke them into pieces , and threw them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Half Moon reached approximately the point where Albany , capital of the Empire State , now stands ( page 477 ) . Hudson suspected he had reached the head of navigation , and this view was confirmed next day when he sent the mate and four other men farther up the river to sound the channel . Two days later , with typical thoroughness , Hudson sent out the boat again . When the men returned they announced they had ascended several more miles ? traditionally to about the site of Cohoes and Waterford ? and had found the river only seven feet deep . FAILURE AGAIN Long since , Hudson had probably realized that this steadily diminishing fresh-water stream could hardly be the channel to the western ocean . But now this disappointing fact had been proved beyond a doubt . While Hudson 's reconnoitering party was away in the ship 's boat , he and his mate invited " some of the chiefe men of the countrey " aboard the Half Moon and got them drunk , to see whether they had any treacherie in them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the boat all night . But the one woman in the party , wife of a chief , proved herself such a lady that Juet marveled . She " sate so modestly , " he wrote , " as any of our countrey women would doe in a strange place . " Dropping down the river from Albany , the explorers " gathered good store of chestnuts , " perhaps at or near the location of the city of Hudson . Next day , about the site of Catskill Landing on the west side of the river , they noted the fertility of the ground , the size of the oak and other trees , and the abundance of stone for building houses . In the vicinity of Red Hook they caught four or five and twentie mullets , breames , bases , and barbils " in an hour . Often they encountered friendly natives . Once the visitors included two Indian maidens of 16 or 17 , who , even Juet is forced to admit , " behaved themselves very modestly . " Probably the sight of the bushy-bearded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot which caught Juet 's eye as " a very pleasant place to build a towne on " was evidently in the neighborhood of Newburgh and Beacon , a few miles below Poughkeepsie and the Franklin D. Roosevelt estate at Hyde Park ( page 480 ) . TRAGEDY OUT OF A PILLOW On the first of October , as the Half Moon slowly approached Manhattan , swift tragedy broke ? brought on by a light-fingered native 's theft of a pillow , two shirts , and two leather belts ! Let Juet tell the rest of the brutal story : " Our masters mate shot at him , and strooke him on the brest , and killed him . Whereupon all the rest fled away , some in their canoes , and some leapt out of them into the water . " We manned our boat , and got our things again . Then one of them that swamme got hold of our boat , thinking to overthrow it . But our cooke tooke a sword , and cut off one of his hands , and he was drowned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had escaped from the Half Moon on the way up the river appeared with a strong band of companions , as Juet says , " thinking to betray us . " In the ensuing fight seven or eight Indians were killed and the rest fled , whereupon Hudson went six or seven miles downstream and rode in safety through the night " on that side of the river that is called Manna-hata . " At last , when October was four days old and frosts were reddening the hardwood trees of Manhattan , the little Half Moon emerged from the river of its many adventures and sailed out into the open sea . Hudson was eager to hurry home , for he feared his unruly crew might take the ship and turn pirate . On November 7 he anchored safely at Dartmouth in Devon . LAST ACT OF HUDSON DRAMA When reports of his discoveries spread to London , the authorities flatly forbade him and the other English members of the crew to go on to report to his Dutch employers . " Where , " they probably asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagrantly he had disobeyed his orders , perhaps was not sorry to avoid being called on the carpet by a bunch of angry Dutch uncles . But the news of his discoveries reached Amsterdam , and the shrewd Dutch traders soon followed up Hudson 's efforts by building a fort on Manhattan and sending out colonists . New Amsterdam , later New York , was born . Meanwhile the mariner was off on another adventure , destined to be his last . Like a well-planned drama his eventful life was marching toward a tragic climax . This time Hudson was to explore a region that long had whetted his curiosity and appealed to him as offering perhaps the best chance of a short route to the Orient , the icy region west of Davis Strait . Several of London 's merchant adventurers backed him , gambling a ship , a few pounds , and a few sailors ' lives on the chance of fabulous fortune . The chief backers were Sir Dudley Digges , Sir Thomas Smith , and Master John Wolstenholme . LOGBOOK PRUNED BY MUTINEERS Direct knowledge of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hudson 's log , cut short and sharply pruned by the mutineers to eliminate incriminating passages ; second , the sanctimonious but detailed effusions of a pious landlubber , Abacuk Prickett , a haberdasher and a servant of Sir Dudley Digges , who returned from the tragic voyage in safety and has often been suspected of a prejudiced account intended to ease the punishment of the mutineers ; and , third , a scribbled note found in the desk of Thomas Wydhouse , a  |p480  " student of the mathematickes " on Hudson 's ship and one of those set adrift by the mutinous crew . Like a finger out of the grave it points at the guilt of Juet and others and counteracts Prickett 's attempt to present Hudson in an unfavorable light. * On April 17 , 1610 , Hudson presumably kissed his much-neglected wife goodbye , boarded his new vessel , the Discovery , and dropped down the Thames with the tide . With him once more went his son John . As if in omen of disaster , trouble arose even before the ship left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Coleburne , " off the ship and sent him home on a boat bound for London . With him went a letter from Hudson telling his employers the reason for this strange act , but probably the disgruntled Coleburne tore it up , for his offense has never become known . Coleburne seems to have been sent along as a sort of adviser to Hudson . Sailing north by way of the Orkneys and Faeroes , Hudson , ever the alert geogra  |p481  pher , found that the tip of Scotland , the Orkneys , and the Shetland Islands all were too far north on existing charts . Breidi Fiord , a gulf on the west coast of Iceland , Hudson 's men inelegantly dubbed " Lousie Bay " because there , finding springs of hot water , they gratefully bathed and deloused themselves . " They had found there a bath hot enough to scald a fowle . " MUTTERINGS OF MUTINY The Discovery passed Greenland , and as it entered what would later be known as Hudson Strait , fearsome icebergs , strong currents , and " over-falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of our men this day fell sicke , " says Prickett . " I will not say it was for feare , although I saw small signe of other grief e . " At last the little ship was so beset with ice that the men began to mutter of returning home ; whereupon Hudson called the crew together , brought out his chart to show how far they had come , and agreed to be governed by their decision as to whether he should advance or retreat . Such a democratic suggestion by a sea captain may easily be taken for irresolution . The malcontents were emboldened and sharp words passed , for already tempers were beginning to fray . " If I had an hundred pounds , " quoth one , " I would gladly give fourscore and ten to be at home . " But the stout-hearted carpenter , Philip Staffe , laughed at such fears . " If I had an hundred , " he told the company , " I would not give ten upon such condition , but would think it to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the ship continued . Near Akpatok Island , which Hudson named Desire Provoketh , the men worked off some of their ill spirits by chasing polar bears . To several of the bays , islands , and capes in Hudson Strait the navigator gave names , including " Salisburies Foreland " ( Salisbury Island ) , " Cape Worsenholme " ( Cape Wolstenholme ) , and " Cape Digs " ( Digger Islands ) . * On one island an exploring party headed by Prickett discovered " some round hills of stone , like to grasse cockes , which at the first I tooke to be the work of some Christian . " Opening one , Prickett found it GNIFICENT FAILURE 481 " full of fowles hanged by their neckes . " They had stumbled on an Eskimo cache . The men urged Hudson to stay and let them gorge themselves on these fat and apparently ownerless birds , waiting ready for the pot . But Hudson would have none of it . These twin . " capes " ( Digges and Wolstenholme ) seemed to guard the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would lead to the Orient and everlasting fame ? They sailed on , the land fell away , and before Hudson stretched an immense open sea . How he must have thrilled with hope , little knowing that this was but a huge bay , the cul-de-sac in which he would meet his death . " Confidently proud that he had won the passage , " Hudson sailed southward . But his jubilation was short-lived . He soon found himself lost in the maze of islands that clutter the eastern side of Hudson and James Bays . Day by day it became clearer that they were making about as much progress as if sailing in a trouser pocket . THE SHOWDOWN Nerves and tempers grew frazzled and criticism arose . Juet went about jeering at the master 's hope of reaching the Indies by Candlemas . Grave charges about Juet reached the master 's ears . " Slander ! " cried the mate , and demanded a showdown . On September 10 , after dinner , the captain called the entire company together to hear the case for and against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the accusations against him were overwhelming . Philip Staffe , the carpenter , and Ladlie Arnold looked him straight in the face and with hand on Bible swore the mate had urged them to keep swords and loaded muskets ready in their cabins . Other seamen took oath that Juet had talked of a bloody mutiny and murder and had threatened to take the ship into his own hands and head for home . Hudson 's action under the circumstances was surprisingly lenient . He displaced Juet as mate and demoted the bosun . FROZEN IN FOR THE WINTER But now the dissension grew even worse , though the grumbling was driven underground . The hot hate of Juet fermented in secret , infecting others with discontent .  |p484  By now they had been wandering about in the labyrinthine bay three months and the long , cold winter was at hand , for the end of October had arrived . In all that time they had seen but one sign of human life , an Indian 's footprint in the snow . At last , near the southern shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies were running low , and Hudson offered a small reward for each animal , fish , or fowl brought in by the crew . In the ides of November the ship 's gunner , John Williams , died , and the malcontents were quick to say that the master 's slave-driving ways were responsible . But their regard for the gunner did not prevent them from coveting his belongings , particularly a " gray cloth gowne . " And out of a quarrel over a mere garment Hudson made himself an unrelenting enemy compared to whom Juet , with all his hatred , seems pale a ne'er-do-well named Henrie Greene . This burly black sheep of a good Kent family had been brought on the voyage by Hudson " because he could write well . " A scamp and a waster , he was trusted by no one , but Hudson apparently had taken pity on him , giving him food , drink , and lodging in his own home . At Iceland Greene had gotten into a row with the ship 's surgeon and beaten him severely . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Prickett , defended Greene , blaming the surgeon 's sharp tongue for the trouble . Juet began saying the master had brought Greene along as a stool pigeon to discredit anybody who happened to displease him . This talk of Juet 's had come to Hudson 's ears early in the voyage and made him so angry that he seriously considered going back to Iceland and sending the mate home in a fishing boat . But now Greene had incurred the captain 's displeasure by siding with the carpenter in an argument with Hudson over building a house on shore . The captain 's anger , says Prickett , took the petty form of denying Greene the " gowne " which he had previously promised him . When Greene protested , according to this prejudiced witness , Hudson railed at the man , telling him he could n't be trusted with twenty shillings and that he should have no wages if he did n't mend his ways . This affront brought out all the devil in Greene , and he plotted , biding his time . Meanwhile , ptarmigan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion brewed from tree buds staved off the scurvy . But spring found the crew in pitiable shape , many of them with badly frozen feet , including Prickett himself . A LONE INDIAN COMES ? AND GOES With the break-up of the ice a lone Indian appeared and Hudson was overjoyed . He asked the crew to turn in all their knives and hatchets to be used for trading purposes but sinister note ? only the carpenter and Prickett would part with theirs . Once the Indian returned with deer and beaver skins , but he was badly treated and after that he never came back . Hudson was in despair , and finally he himself set out in the ship 's boat in the hope of locating the natives . But they eluded him and even set forest fires to keep the whites away . Returning , Hudson divided equally the dwindling supply of bread and the Discovery sailed out of her wintering place . Wilson , the new bosun , gobbled two weeks ' supply of bread in a day , getting a stomachache for his pains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of his share to a friend to keep lest he eat it all at once , but within two or three days he had wheedled it away and bolted it all anyhow . THE PLOT IS REVEALED Finally , on the night of June 21 , 1611 , these two precious scamps came to Prickett 's cabin , where he lay with badly frozen feet , and told him they had decided to put the captain and all the sick men except Prickett himself into the open boat and let them shift for themselves . A strong suspicion exists that Prickett 's own life was spared so that he might intercede with his master , Sir Dudley Digges , in behalf of the mutineers . In the flickering shadows of that smelly little room Williams and Greene declared their unshakable determination to go through with the deed or die . They had not eaten for three days , they said , and they would just as soon hang as starve . They declared that the captain was concealing food and playing favorites in its distribution . Hudson , they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hunting for his passage to China and the food supply would last but two more weeks . With the captain and the sick men cast adrift , there might be enough food to sustain the rest . Thus they talked , in the  |p485  eerie lamplight , while Hudson , unsuspecting , slept . In vain Prickett tried to dissuade them , he says . He charged Greene flatly with seeking " blood and revenge . " But in the end the best he could do was to get them to swear to a sanctimonious and hypocritical oath of his own devising , thus : " You shall sweare truth to God , your prince and countrie ; you shall doe nothing , but to the glory of God and the good of the action in hand , and harm to no man . " To this the plotters readily agreed , no doubt with their fingers crossed . By ones and twos the others crept to his cabin . It was darke , and they in a readiness to put this deed of darkness in execution . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Then , as the sky began to lighten toward the east , he found an excuse to go elsewhere and left the actual taking of his captain and benefactor to others . MUTINY ON THE " DISCOVERY " As Hudson stepped out of his cabin he was quickly confronted by John Thomas and Bennett Mathues , their faces grim , while William Wilson , the man he had promoted to bosun , darted behind him and pinioned his arms . Hudson , who apparently had no inkling of this , must have thought himself still asleep and dreaming . " What do you mean to do ? " he demanded of his captors . " You will find out soon enough when  |p488  you are in the shallop , " they sneered . John King , the quartermaster , who was attacked by Juet in the hold , snatched up a sword and wielded it so well that the old seaman had to call for help . Meanwhile Greene had gone to the place where the loyal carpenter slept and held him in conversation until the other two had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk and the others who were to be set adrift were likewise so weak that they could do no more than rail feebly at the villains who were taking their lives . Painfully , at Greene 's harsh orders , they dragged themselves to the side and found places in the shallop which had quickly been lowered . Then the captain called upon Prickett to aid him , and the old landsman limped to the door of his cabin where he made a final plea to the mutineers , he says , beseeching them , " for the love of God , to remember themselves , and to doe as they would be done unto . " But Greene and the rest ordered him back to his cabin , not allowing the master to speak with him . Later , when the shallop with the Hudsons and the sick men in it drifted near the window of Prickett 's cabin , the doomed  |p489  captain called out , " It is that villain Juet that hath undone us . " Nay , " answered Prickett , " it is Greene that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE BORE THE MASTER " Now Staffe , the ship 's carpenter , was freed , Greene having spared him probably in the belief that such a stout seaman would be useful on the long voyage home . But the sturdy Staffe would have none of this . " Do you want to be hanged when you come home ? " he demanded , confronting the ringleaders . " As for me , I will not stay in the ship unless you force me . " " Go then , " they said , " for we will not stay you . " " I will , " answered he , " so I may have my chest with all that is in it . " Accordingly , they allowed him to get his clothes and tools , and the carpenter took his place in the shallop " for the love he bore the master . " This unsung hero , Hudson 's carpenter , had sailed with him before . To Prickett he confided that he planned to hoist the little sail and follow the vessel in the hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship like a crew of pirates , breaking open the chests and rifling everything in sight . But finally they hoisted sail and slowly stood out of the ice , the shallop towing behind . Then one of their number cut the rope and the little boat with its tragic cargo quickly fell away astern . Before long the mutineers took in their topsails and lay to , while they further ransacked the ship . But soon someone yelled that the shallop had come within sight , whereupon " they let fall the mainsayle and out with their top-sayles , and fly as from an enemy . " The little open boat faded into the distance and nothing was ever seen again of Henry Hudson , John Hudson , or any of the seven men with them ( page 490 ) . Whether they died in the icy waters or reached shore to live for a little time will never be known . RESCUE SHIPS SAILED IN VAIN Three ships sent out the following year , by order of the Ping , partly to search for Hudson and partly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henry Hudson probably was ready for death . In his own eyes he had proved the rankest of failures . Four times he had tried , and four times he had failed . The last hope of his life was gone . But history 's verdict on Hudson is very different from his own . In the sheer extent of his voyages he far surpassed any other Arctic explorer of his time . Resourceful , he tried not one but four of the possible routes to his goal . His great virtue was his thoroughness . Where before him the map bristled with vaguely outlined shores , will-o ' - the- wisp capes , and phantom islands , behind him he left it plainly marked . If he was a failure , he was a magnificent one . His bold explorations cleared away immense blind spots , opened the way for the founding of New Amsterdam . and made known to the world , though he did not discover , the great river , strait , and bay which carry his name . The Hudson River , as stated , was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably by Sebastian Cabot , and Hudson Bay by the Portuguese . But it took Hudson 's hard work and dramatic career to etch them on the maps and minds of the world . In his wake came commerce ? whales in the north , fortunes in furs in New York and the Hudson Bay country . And what a figure of devotion is young John Hudson ! In all of history he speaks not a word ; yet when the name of Hudson is seen on the map he , too , should be remembered . RETRIBUTION STRIKES And what of the Discovery ? Did she ever reach home ? She did , by dint of a nightmare voyage in which her sailors were reduced to eating seaweed fried with candle ends , and landed , more dead than alive , only to be put in prison . Old Juet died on the way , of slow starvation . But the other leading plotters met a swifter end . Encountering Eskimos near the mouth of Hudson Bay , the Discovery 's men , perhaps up to the Half Moon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 482 ) . They were set upon and Greene , who had talked of turning pirate , went down crying " Coragio " and laying about him with a club . William Wilson died cursing . Michael Perce and Thomas , too , were killed . There apparently was no hanging as a sequel to the crime against Hudson . Yellowed papers unearthed in London a few years ago , after having been lost for  |p490  three centuries , disclosed that Prickett , Edward Wilson , barber-surgeon , and some of the others were tried and acquitted of the mutiny . The court seems to have felt the guilty were already dead . And what of the captain 's widow , Mrs. Katharine Hudson ? A strong-minded woman evidently was she . Left almost penniless by her husband 's murder , she sought compensation from the backers of the voyage . Not only did she win for her son Richard a lucrative position in the service of the British East India Company , but she proceeded to India , too , and actually engaged in the company 's trade herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she thought the company had gotten the better of her in a matter of freight charges , she promptly sued . One of the company 's old books contains the entry , " end of Mrs. Hudson 's tiresome suit . " A strong-minded woman indeed ! Perhaps we can understand better now why Henry Hudson liked those long , long trips at sea .
