FINCH 'S FORTUNEGeorge 's invincible idleness that made the thought of a superfluityof money so captivating . Money without working for it . That was what Finch was going to have , and its advancingbrightness already was touching Finch 's lanky figure . That figure , as George opened the rectory door , stood silhouetted against the moonlit snow with an air almost mysterious , the face in darkness , for the dim light in the hallmarked no feature but his eyes . " Oh , hello , Finch ! " said George , in laconic welcome. " h ello , Jarge ! " boomed Finch , feeling suddenly hilarious . Ile entered , stamping the snow from his boots and flinging his cap and coat on the rack . " What ' s your latestcrime ? " " Murdering Mozart , " said George . " I ' ve been playinghim on the mandolin . " He banged the door and kicked the snow that Finch had brought in off the rug into the corner . " Awfully cold , is n't it ? " Finch struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cold , yes , but glorious coining across the fields ! You ' d think it was the first snow that had ever fallen , it 's so white . And the shadows ! Every sniallcst twig  --  as though it were done in blue-black ink . And my own shadow  --  I wish you could have seen it ! It simply leaped anddanced along beside me like a wild thing ! " " Now I wonder what made it do that , " said George , looking at him round-eyed . " Do n't be so beastly prosaic , Jarge ! I f you had beenthere , you ' d have ( lanced , too . " " I do n't see myself out on a night like this unless there isa girl or a party at the other end . I wish it had n't stopped snowing , though , because if it had kept on all night at the rate it was falling I should n't have been able to get in tobusiness on Monday . " Although George was a year younger than Finch , his courseat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had goneTHE TWO FRIENDS 41into a broker 's office . He had chosen the career of broker 's clerk because it seemed to him an easy life and one in which money was talked about largely even though not seen . Iie led the way upstairs to his own small room . It was as uncomfortable as a room could well be , its only warmth rising through an uncovered stovepipe hole from the kitchen below , but a kind of soft glow that emanated from George 's compactperson and the memory of hilarious times they had had there gave it a peculiar charm for Finch . He sank down on the sagging sofa and took out a pipe . George had never seen him smoke anything but a cigarette , and he looked on with astonishment while Finch filled the pipe from an old pouch that had once belonged to Nicholas . Finch was a little embarrassed . He had had the pipe with him on his last visit to the rectory , but had lacked the courage to produceit . He fancied that he looked more of a man when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could never hope to look so thoroughly at ease with it as Pierswith his . " What 's the idea ? " asked George , lighting a cigarette . " Trying to look like a Famous Author , an American Ambassador , or a British Prime Minister ? " From a cloud of smoke Finch answered , " I do n't know what you are driving at . I ' ve been smoking a pipe for some time  --  off and on . It ' s less trouble and more economical . " George chuckled . " You ' re choosing an original time for economy . Just when you ' re twenty-one , and more money in the offing than you ' 11 know how to spend . " " Well , I suppose it ' s simply that I ' ve come to the age for smoking a pipe , " said Finch , with dignity . " Besides , it ' s good for me . You know , my nerves are pretty rocky . You 've no idea how odd I feel sometimes . Absolutely up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd feel odd too , if I was about to fall heir to a fortune . " " I wish , " observed Finch , rather nettled , " that you42 FINCH 'S FORTUNEwould n't talk as though I were a millionaire . What is ahundred thousand dollars ! " " I ' ve no idea . I ca n't imagine such a sum . " " You say that , and you a broker ! " George , a junior clerk in a broker 's office , liked the appellation . He became serious . " Oh , well , one 's business isso impersonal . " " Yes , but look here . A hundred thousand is n't so verymuch in these days . My two uncles each went through thatmuch and have scarcely a penny left . " " And yet they grudge you your chance ! " Finch flushed deeply . " Sorry , " said George . " But I could n't help hearingthings . They did n't take many pains to hide their feelings about it . " " I do n't blame them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't blame them a bit  --  for anything theysaid . " " Perhaps , but it makes it hard for you . " " Oh , yes , awfully hard . " He had to compress his sensitiveupper lip on the pipe to keep it from quivering . He was lost in unhappy thoughts for a moment , then his eyes sought George 's with a look of almost triumph iii them . " But theyare quite different about it now . They ' re awfully decent to me . I went into my Uncle Ernest 's room this afternoon . He and Uncle Nick and Renny and Piers were there . I could see when I went in that they had been talking about me . I felt uncomfortable for a hit . Then I found out that what they ' d been talking about was a dinner for me  --  on my birthday . " No amount of compression would keep the lip still now . Heclenched his teeth on the stem of the pipe . George was impressed . " A dinner , eh ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it first . " " I do n't know , but it was Piers who first spoke of it . It'sto be just a small dinner party , but we scarcely ever haveTHE TWO FRIENDS 43 people in , you know , and I think or the whole it will be lessof a strain for us if we 've a few guests to look after . Do n't you agree ? " George reflected , trying to put himself in the place of these high-spirited , skittish Whiteoaks . The dinner party , then , was to be a bridge between the day before Finch 's birthday and the day after . Across this bridge the family might march , in gala procession . He said , " I like the idea . It should certainlyhelp you out . " " I wish it were all over , " said Finch , with almost a groan . " There ' s another thing I ' m dreading . That is tellingRenny that I ' m not going back to Varsity . I simply ca n't do it . " George regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sensible . I had to give it up . Too much of a strain . I suppose you ' 11 go in for music . " " Lord , I do n't know ! That is , if you mean my making a career of it , I do n't believe I have it in me . " " What rot ! You ' ve got more talent than any chap Iknow . Everyone who hears you play thinks you ' re wasting your time doing anything else . " " I know I am . Yet I do n't believe I ' 11 ever be good at concert work . When I played at that recital last month , Iplayed my very worst . My teacher was awfully disappointed . He ' d slaved over nie . He expected something really goodfrom me . And I ' d practised like hell . But  --  you know how it was  --  I nearly broke down twice . " " You ' 11 get over all that nervousness , " said George , comfortingly . " No , I sha n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more hopeful about myself . But I did n't . I just felt half dead . I did n't care about anything . Nothing looked real to me . Thepiano did n't look real . And when I nearly broke down , it was n't because I was nervous , or forgot . It was just that I felt too bored to go on . It was as though something inside44 FINCH 'S FORTUNEthe piano said to me , You blasted fool , do you think you can bring me out , whenever you want , and show me off ? I ' 11 show you off , for what you are , just a hopeless idiot ! ' " George looked solemn at this . " I think the trouble with you , Finch , is that you take yourself too seriously . All your family are inclined to take themselves too seriously . It ' s in the blood . All that talk about the Court nose ! And the Court temper ! I tell you , it is n't done nowadays . It is n't worth while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being something inside the piano that jeers at you and tells you that you ' re bored , when what you are is just frightened , that ' s letting your imagination get the upper hand of you . When I was a kid , I used to imagine things , so I know all about it . That big stuffed owl that stands in the niche on the stairway was one of the things I got nervous about . I knew quite well that he was only a queer specimen my grandfather had shot in the North somewhere . I knew he was moth-eaten . But I got it into my silly young head that there was something queer about him  --  that he did n't like me . " " Did you really ? " Finch leaned forward , his eyes full of intense curiosity . I Ie had never heard ( ; eorge talk like this before , and it brought them very near each other . " Yes . And 1 ' d never go up the stairs without wondering if it was n't in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing . I could have sworn that he moved on his perch . " Finch saw before him George , not the sober-eyed youth who faced him , but a little boy creeping up the stairs , his frightened chuckle . " Well , one night , on my way to bed , I was so sure that he was going to nip me that I went up the stairs in about three leaps . My heart was pounding so I could hardly breathe . I stood at the top hanging on to the banister and glaring down at my left leg to make sure it wasTHE TWO FRIENDS 45all right . Just then Father came out of his study and looked up at me . What ' s the matter ? ' he asked , and I whined that I was afraid the owl was going to nip my leg . Well , he ran up the stairs and picked me up and carried me back to the niche where the owl was . He said , Now put your leg right under his beak , and if he bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lid , and of course nothing happened . Even after that I was a bit nervous . But the next night I got my courage up and I slopped on the step that was on a level with his niche . I stuck my leg in and I squeaked , Bite me , old owl , if you dare ! ' And when he did n't , I gave him a good swift kick and ran on upstairs . . . . Ever since then I am done with imaginings . " Hiseyes beamed into Finch 's . " Of course , I ' m not comparing the fancies of a silly kid to the fancies of a grown man , but their root is in the same place and the place is fear . I think if you had had someone like my father to take you in hand you might n't be so full of fancies to-day . He did more for me that night than he ever knew of . " Finch nodded . " If one of my brothers had found out that I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me things about its habits that would have curdled my blood . " " Look here , old fellow , take my advice . Get yourself in hand and make up your mind that you ' II not let anything frighten you out of doing what you want to . You do want to be a great pianist , do n't you ? " Finch mumbled , " I do n't know what I want , George , and that ' s a fact , except that I do n't want to go on with my Universitycourse . I could howl when I think of all the money Renny 's wasted on me . He ' s got to let me pay it back . If I could just have a few months to myself  --  to think  --  to get used to myself . There ' s no use in talking  --  you ca n't imagine what it ' s like to be such a duffer as I am ! " They smoked in silence for a space , George regarding Finch 's bowed head affectionately , Finch 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white owl . George said suddenly :  --  " Well , you have your own life . Your own work , whatever it ' s going to be , and if you do n't want to work at all you are your own man  --  no one can force you . Do you realize. that ? " Finch started . " What ' s that ? Oh , yes , my own man ! Of course . . . . I can do what I like . " " Yes , " went on George , solidly . " You can do what you like , just when you like . Now I think the first thing you should do is to take a trip . Travel round a bit and see things . You ' d get a different slant on your life . You ' d get used to yourself . You ' d get away from the family . " Finch began to laugh . " Funny you ' d suggest that . It ' s just what I have been planning  --  with one big difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " You ' re not in earnest ! " " Yes , I am ! They 've been wanting for years to visit the Old Country again . Their sister lives in England , you know . They are getting old . Have n't much time to waste . I know what it would mean to them . And i f it came through me , you understand , well  --  it would make a kinder feeling . " George rumpled his hair in deep puzzlement . " Its your idea , then , to start out to see the world , and do this thinking you talk about with an ancient uncle on either side of you , " he said , musingly . " And your sight-seeing would be to visit an ancient aunt . Well , all I can say is , you are the world 's champion philanthropist ! " Rot ! I ' 11 go off on my own whenever I like . And I ' m awfully fond of my aunt . I 've been wanting to visit her all my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . I ca n't quite explain , but it amounts to this : I ca n't really enjoy my money , and all the possibilities it opens up to me , until I ' ve done something  --  not necessarily a big thing  --  but somethingquite decent for each of the others . It ' s as thoughTHE TWO FRIENDS 47there were a spell on me that I must work through . " His eyes were fixed , with an expression George thought hallucinated , on the smoke from his pipe that hung in a level blue plane before him . " Of course , of course , " George agreed , thinking , " What a queer egg ! But one must take him as he is . " Like the piano , the banjo , the mandolin , Finch was accepted by George for the peculiar qualities that gave companionship in season . " What have you thought of doing for Piers ? " he asked , and he remembered , a little grimly , times when Piers had bullied Finch . " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps something for Pheasant . I ' m not going to be in a hurry about it . They ' d say at once that I was showing off . No , it ' s got to come slowly , beginning with the uncles . " His gaze , which had been remote , now moved , with speculative interest , to the stovepipe hole in the floor . A low murmur of voices came from the kitchen below . " Yes , " said George , " they ' re still at it . Lizzie and her steady , and they get no forrarder , as far as I can see . " He moved to the extreme edge of his chair and peered through the opening as though into a cage at the Zoo . Finch also moved nearer , crouching beside him , their heads touching . They could see one end of a clean kitchen table on which stood a dish of red apples . They could see a pair of man 's hands , middle-aged and horny , paring an apple with a thickhandledpocket knife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be broken , but removed whole from stem to blossom . The two above watched , fascinated , seeing the fine rosy skin of the fruit drop from it , leaving the fruit itself , white as a woman 's breast , in the coarse fingers . The paring was pushed across the table to an unseen person , the apple was halved . Then a slice was cut from it , impaled on the knife , and put into the mouth of the parer himself . They glimpsed his grizzled forelock as48 FINCH 'S FORTUNEhis head advanced to it . Another slice was impaled and presented to the mouth across the table , and so , a slice at a time , the apple was demolished . The clumsy hands gathered up seeds and core , disposed of them somewhere , picked up another apple , and began to pare it . There was an indistinct mumblingof talk . Finch returned to his seat with a sigh . " How long has this been going on ? " he asked . " About five years . " " God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queer thing . Especially when it takes them like that . " " I expect it ' s queer no matter how it takes you . " " Been seeing much of girls lately ? " " No . Too busy . " " You liked Ada Leigh , did n't you ? " " Hm-hm . She ' s been in France with her mother . " " I do n't believe you 've a great opinion of that sex , Finch . " " Oh  --  I do n't know . " He sighed deeply . " I have n'thad much experience of them . " George folded his arms and spoke rather ponderously . " A really dazzling one comes into our office sometimes  --  about investments , you know . A rich widow . She always seems to want my advice about things . I ca n't see why , because I ' m only a junior . She always seems to want to know lust what I think about everything . Some women are odd , are n't they ? " " How old is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once they ' re past twenty I ' m all at sea . " " But you 've a way with you , Jarge , " said Finch affectionately . George unfolded his arms and unknit his brow . " How about a little music ? " he asked . THE TWO FRIENDS 49On the way down the stairs , Finch had stopped to look at the stuffed white owl . He had thrust his hands under its great folded wings and felt the deep downiness there . He had put his face close to the black beak , the glittering eyes . A sensuous pleasure had run over his body at the feel of the iwl 's downiness . He thought of the pure whiteness where his hands were hid . . . . All the way home he exulted in thoughts of it . The face of the earth seemed to him like the owl 's breast . The stars had the cold glitter of the owl 's eyes ; the bitter wind was its hoot . . . . It had left its perch and swept through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become one with the night , the beating of its wings the rhythm of the universe . He left the road and took his customary short cut through the fields , though the path had long been obliterated . The snow lay in great drifts , light as mounds of fallen feathers . Ile dashed through them , bounding , with each leap , as high as he could . All his instinct revolted against being grown up . He wished only to be a wild half-mad boy , that the passage of time might not touch him . . . . He pulled off his cap and ran bareheaded , dancing with his shadow , trying to wrest his spirit from his body , and toss it , a glistening essence , into the frosty air . IIe fancied how the great owl would pounce on it , a tender morsel for its starry-eyed young , and sweep Pole-ward with it , uttering a whoo-hoo that would shake the universe . He left the fields and ran through the pine wood . He left the pine wood and ran through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moonlight as in a sea , laving their round boles in it , keeping nothing of themselves from it , shivering in their naked whiteness as they drowned themselves in it . He ran through the apple orchard , where the gnarled black shapes of the trees were like old men dancing . There was an50 FINCH 'S FORTUNEicy pathway there from which the wind had blown the snow , and he slid along it , cap in hand , in long graceful glides . He ran through the young cherry orchard , where the trees stood in straight rows like timid , half-grown girls , and as he emerged into the garden he saw the lights of the house welcoming him . As soon as he saw them , the shadow of the owl grew smaller , but still , he thought , it followed him , swooping , lower and lower , towards his legs . A sensation of terror took hold of him . Ile ran panting , his consciousness trickling from his brain to his nether parts . Would it catch him before he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes afire . IIe plunged across the lawn , and flung himself against the door . It flew open , and , at the same instant , he felt a cruel nip on the left leg ! " My dear boy , " said Uncle Ernest , " what a draft you ' re letting in ! Shut the door quickly ! And you may as well bolt it for the night . " IVTHE BIRTHDAYIT came on the first day of March . He had narrowly escaped being born on the twenty-ninth of February , which , in addition to having been born with a caul , would have singled him out with a directness almost ominous . As it was , he was quite satisfied to have first seen the light with the arrival of spring ; and on this particular birthday the season did not , as was its wont , appear crouching under the cloak of winter . On the contrary , it was a clay of remarkable mildness for the time of year . Rain had fallen steadily all the day and night , and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were already patches of bare ground on the lawn . By noon that part of it which was not in shadow lay revealed to the warmth of the sun . Last year 's grass had retained something of its color , and even seemed to have grown , as the hair of a dead person is said to flourish morbidly for long after burial . The withered forms of last year 's asters and calendulas lay sodden on the soaking soil of the flower border ; under the hedge last year 's leaves lay in a discolored ridge . Yet all was enlivened by a boundless hope . The abnormally large drops of rain and melted snow that were strung on every twig and blade and ledge were glancing with radiant brightness . The sky was swept clean of all that catne between its sun and the earth . No return of cold and snow could efface the promise of this day . The door into the hall stood wide open , letting in the sun . It was on such a day as this that old Adeline would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloaks , scarfs , and petticoats , so that she looked a very battleshi FINCH 'S FORTUNEof a woman , she would come into view , supported by her sons , and present herself foursquare to the reviving world . " I ' m out again ! " she would exclaim . " Ha ! I like the smell of the fresh air ! " Finch thought a good deal about her to-day , recalling their strange delayed intimacy that had drawn them so mysteriously together , wondering if it were possible for him to live in a way that would have won her approbation . Still , she had known him for what he was , had loved him , had accepted him as one of " the whelps " her son Philip had got by his second wife . Ile stood in the porch sunning himself , and watched Rags furbishing up the hall . How shabby both hall and servant looked in the noonday brightness ! The slender walnut banisterand carved newel post were elegant enough , but the wallpaper along the stairway showed dingy where small hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been repapered in his time . The carpet on the stairs was threadbare . The Turkish rug on the floor had lost all its fringe . The fringe had reappeared miraculously on the cuff of Rags 's coat . This cuff was being violently agitatedas he polished the mirror in the hatrack , above which the carved head of a fox sneered down at him . " Well , " he said , seeing Finch , " many happy returns of the d'y to you , sir ! " " Thanks , Rags . " " We could n't ' ave a finer d'y for the occasion , not if it ' ad been hordered ! It ' s a fine thing to be twenty-one , sir , and to ' ave all the money in the family . " He looked over his shoulder at Finch with an air of innocent envy . Finch felt like taking the fellow by the scruff of his grizzled neck and shaking him . He said , " You do n't know what you ' re talking about , Rags . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appy d'y for us all , I ' m sure , sir . Mrs. Wragge was saying to me just a bit ago that she ' d prayed for a fine d'y . I don'tTHE BIRTHDAY 53go in for prayer much myself , but , as the saying is , strawrs tell which way the wind blows . Not that she is much like a strawr , sir . More like a strawrstack , I ' d say . I ' ardly dare to go into the kitchen this morning , she and Bessie are that worked up with excitement . And the thought of those catererscoming out from town with all their paraffinaliar ! " He came to the door and shook out his cloth . He then produced a small , foreign-looking leather pocketbook from somewhereabout his clothes . He proffered this to Finch with a bow . " Will you accept this front me , Mr. Finch , as a little offering ? I brought it ' ome with me from the War . It belonged to a German officer . And I ' ve always thought that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money I ' d use it myself . But the d'y ' as n't come , and it looks as though it never would come ,  --  not in this country , and at this job ,  --  so , if you 'll accept it , I ' 11 give it to you with my best wishes , and may it always be full ! " Finch took it , embarrassed . It was a handsome pocketbook , and there was something touching in Rags 's expression as he offered it , but then Finch always had the uncomfortable feeling that Rags was laughing in his sleeve at him . " Thanks , very much , " he mumbled . " It ' s an awfully good one . " He opened it , looked in it , shut it . Rags regardedhim with an expression of mingled sadness and pride . He gave his duster another shake and reentered the hall . Mooey was descending the stairs on his little seat , a step at a time . Finch watched him , feeling suddenly very happy . Everyone was amazingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . Piers and Pheasant , gold cuff links . Uncle Nicholas , a paper weight ; and Uncle Ernest , a water color from the wall of his own room . Alayne had given him a crocodile-skin traveling bag and Wakefield a clothes brush , which , he explained , would " come in handy to whack his kids with when he had any . " Meggie 's present was yet to arrive. 54 FINCH 'S FORTUNE " Bump ! " sang out Mooey . " I ' m toming ! Bump ! Bump ! Bump ! I ' m not f'ightened ! " Finch went to the foot of the stairs and snatched him up . He put him on his shoulder , and out of the shadows of the past came a picture of himself , caught up thus by Renny . A queer thing life . . . . One tall strong body , one little weak body after another . . . . Some day Mooey would stand at the foot of the stairs and shoulder some tiny boy just as to-day he was doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose would be the tiny boy ? Some little Whiteoak , out of a Whiteoak body . . . . Mooey clasped Finch 's head , and pressed his round flowerlikeface to Finch 's thin one . " I want to go out on the nish g'een g'ash , " he said . " The grass may be green , but it ' s not nice . It ' s nasty and soggy . " " I 1-like nawsty soggy fings . " " Very well , 1 ' 11 carry you out and stand you on your head on it . " He ran out the door and down the steps . " There ' s a nish soggy spot , " said Mooey , pointing out a puddle . " I ' 11 tell you what I ' 11 do , " cried Finch . " I ' 11 take you to the stables to sec Uncle Renny . " He had got an idea . He would find Renny and broach the subject of quitting the University this very hour . Renny was always more or less absent-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of Mooey would be a help , too , for Renny had a way of staring at him speculatively and only half listening to what was being said . They found the master of Jalna in the paddock , mounted on a bright bay mare which he was training as a high jumper . Two grooms stood by a hurdle , the top bar of which they raised and lowered in accordance with the shouted directions of the rider . Finch , carrying Mooey wrapped in a man 's jersey , stood byTHE BIRTHDAY 55the enclosure unnoticed save by a casual glance . The mountingstrength of the sun was poured down on this sheltered spot , giving the impression of a day in late April rather than one in early March . The intrinsic quality of all on which the sun 's rays fell was made evident in smell or color . The earth , newly thawed , trampled by the feet of horses and men , gave forth a pungent and profoundly vital odor . There had been pressed and soaked and baked and frozen into it  --  ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had chosen this particular place for this purpose  --  rotted straw and manure , and the impalpable essence absorbed by the earth from the sanguine activities of men and beasts . Every hair in the young mare 's mane and tail seemed charged with energy . Her hide glistened as though varnished , her eyes flashed back the light . Renny 's strong-muscled , mud-spattered legs , his weather-beaten , sweating face , his bare head against which the hair was plastered , the red healthy faces of Wright and Dawlish , their capable hands that took up and replaced the fallen bar , the skin of their hands dry from the grooming of horses and stained with harness oil  --  all these were discovered in the spring sunlight . Between the two men , the mare , and her rider there existed a sympathy not needing the expression of words . When she felt panic and sheered off from the jump , or valiantly essayedit and failed , a like shadow seemed to fall across all four . She blew out her breath in what seemed a great sigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeling her about , drew his brows together in a rueful frown . But when she swung clear of the hurdle , and hung like a bird for a space against the sky , before she alighted triumphant and cantered down the course , a brightness of aspect descended as the sun 's rays on men and mare . A group of cows that had collected as spectators by the fence of an adjoining enclosure looked on the scene with complete lack of sympathy . At the critical moment one might stop chewing the cud , as though the better56 FINCH 'S FORTUNEto concentrate on what was going on , but , be the leap never so birdlike or the failure never so forlorn , the cud-chewingwas resumed with an aloof serenity . Finch thought , " She has done well . I believe it ' s a goodtime to speak . " Renny had dismounted and given the bridle to Wright and was strolling toward him , scrubbing the palms of his handswith a crumpled handkerchief . " Was n't she splendid ? " asked Finch , scrutinizing hiselder 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful jumper . " " T hope so . She ' s a sweet thing . I intend to ride her inNew York this fall , if possible . " He turned to Mooey . " Ilello , what ' s the matter with your nose ? " He gave thesmall feature a decisive wipe with the handkerchief . " I suppose , " said Finch , " he should have something onhis head . " Mooey , his nose quite pink , observed , " T ' in going to jumpa nish ' orsie and not be tightened neider . " " He talks too much about not being frightened , " saidRenny . " It sounds as though he were trying to reassure himself . I hope he 's not going to be a duffer at riding , likeyou. , , " I hope not , " returned Finch dolefully . It took so little to cast him down . There was silence for a moment while Renny struck at theflakes of mud on his legs with his riding crop , then Finch set the little boy on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy of despair . " Look here , Renny , it ' s impossible for me to go back toVarsity ! I simply ca n't do it ! " Renny continued to strike at his leg with his riding crop , but he did not speak . His face hardened . Finch continued , " You ca n't know how it is with me . You ' re always doing the most congenial work . Varsity is n't congenial to me . It is n't anything to me but a grind and aTHE BIRTHDAY 57flatness and an unreality . I do n't see any sense in sticking it out . " The fiery brown eyes , before which he quailed , were raised to his . " What the hell is congenial to you ? I wish you ' d tell me . I thought music was , and I ' ve let you take lessons and spend hours practising when you ought to have been studying . Then , when you play at a recital , you play your worst and you tell me that audiences are n't congenial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't say that ! I said that I was afraid of audiences  --  " " Afraid ! By God  --  afraid ! That ' s the trouble . You 're always afraid ! No wonder the kid there whines about not being frightened ! You ' ve put it in his head ! " Finch had turned white . He had begun to shake . " Renny ! Look here ! Listen ! I  --  I  --  you do n't understand  --  " " Of course I do n't ! Nobody understands . You ' re not like anyone else , are you ? You ' re a student and you ca n't study ! You ' re an actor and you ca n't act ! You ' re a pianist and you ca n't play ! You ' re twenty-one and you act like a girl in her teens ! " Finch flung out his hand . The sun touched the face of the wrist watch Renny had given him that morning . He cursed himself for a fool . Why , oh why , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He dropped his arm . He was cut to the heart . Renny went on , " I suppose you think that because you ' re of age to-day and are coming into some money  --  " " No ! No , I do n't ! I only thought I ' d like to tell you  --  at least , ought to tell you  --  " " Why did n't you tell me long ago ? Why did you let me go on planning for your education  --  " In spite of the unhappy turmoil of his emotions Finch could not help wondering what effort of the brain Renny had spent on him beyond the tardy digging up of his tuition fees , and the58 FINCH 'S FORTUNEdetermination that he should not evade one lecture or examination . He got out , hoarsely , " You shall have it all back ! " " Not a cent ! I wo n't have a cent of it back ! " " But why ? There ' s no reason why you should n't ! " cried Finch distractedly . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of it . " " Burt why ? " " Because , i f I took it back , I should not have reared you and educated you , as it was my duty to do . " " But there ' s no reason in that ! I know how hard it is for you to get money . All along I ' ve said to myself , I ' 11 make it up to Renny ! The thought of that bucked me up to tell you this to-day . Renny , you must take it back ! " " Not a penny . Well , I ca n't force you to go on , but I can feel that I 've done my best , and if you ' re a mess it ' s not my fault ! " He had worked himself into a temper . He showed his teeth , Finch thought , as though he would like to bite him . Things were blurred before Finch 's eyes . The sunlit scene before him began to revolve . He put his hands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked from one uncle to the other , his lip quivering . " I ' m not f'ightened ! " he said . Renny made as if to strike him with his riding crop . " Say that again and I ' 11 thrash you ! " Nothing on earth would have induced him to touch Mooey with the riding crop , but he felt and looked as though he could . Mooey raised his voice in a howl of anguish . At this moment Piers drove up to them in the car . He had been to the village and had brought the mail . Ile got out with the letters in his hand . His son moved toward him screaming , in a kind of dance . Renny said , " That ' s a nice young milksop you ' ve got ! He ' s frightened of his own shadow ! He takes after his Uncle Finch ! " THE BIRTHDAY 59Piers 's fatherliness was roused . He picked up his child and comforted him . " What ' s it all about ? What ' s he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce enough to frighten anyone . " " Oh , it ' s nothing , " said Renny . " Only Finch has just been telling me that he ' s not going to Varsity any more . It ' s uncongenial to him . " Piers 's prominent blue eyes took in the situation . He did not speak for a moment , while he turned the matter over in his mind . Then he said , in his deep voice , " Well , it ' s no surprise to me . I always knew he did n't like college . I did n't like it myself . I do n't see any sense in his taking a course in arts  --  going in for a profession  --  unless he wants . If I were in his place , I ' d do just as he is doing . " Without another word Renny turned and strode toward the stable . Piers looked after the tall retreating figure with composure . " You ' ve got his back up , " he said . " He ' li not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I ' m to do , " said Finch bitterly . " I could n't go on with it . And I thought I could make it up to him  --  but he wo n't let me. l le simply got in a rage . " " Gran will never be dead while he lives ! You may have her gold , but he has her temper . " Finch broke out , " I wish he had them both . " His jaw shook so that he had to clench his teeth to control it . " Keep your shirt on , " said Piers soothingly . " You wo n't be twenty-one for long . My advice is to make the most of it . Go away for a while and he ' II forgive you and want you back . " He looked over the letters . " Here is one for you from England . A birthday greeting from Aunt Augusta , I guess . " Finch took the letter and glanced at the spidery handwriting . He turned , with an ache in his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he muttered , and added , " And thanks for standing up for me . " " That was nothing . I do n't usually see eye to eye with6o FINCH 'S FORTUNE THE BIRTHDAY 6ryou , but I do in this . You ' d be a fool to waste your time in doing what you hate when you have all the world before you . . . . Do you like the cuff links ? " Piers was one of those who find it difficult to express thanks for a gift themselves but who take a sincere pleasure in the reiterated thanks of others . Finch brightened . " Oh , yes . I like them awfully . " " They ' re quite good ones , you know . " " I can see that . But you and Pheasant should n't have done it . It was too much . " " Well , I 've never given you a present before  --  and , if you like them  --  " " I like them tremendously . " " We went into town together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she got that chill . " Finch 's gratitude deepened . " I remember . It was too bad her getting a chill on my account . " " She did n't mind . . . . There goes the stable clock . I ' II be late for lunch . I do n't suppose it will amount to much to-day , with the dinner coming on . I ' 11 take the kid with me . " On the way to the house Finch opened his aunt 's letter . He had a deep affection for her . She had shown him many kindnesseson her visits to Jalna , had worried considerably over his thinness , and tried unsuccessfully to fatten him . It was like her to have remembered his birthday , and to have posted her letter in time to reach him on the very day . Ile read :  --  ' NMI NG HALLNYMICr CREWS , . DEVONihth FebruaryMY DEAR NEPHEW , When you receive this letter you will , I trust , he well and happy , and at the proud moment of attaining your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most auspicious circumstances . I only wish I might be with you to give you my good wishes in person . But I very much doubt whether I shall evervisit Canada again . The mere undertaking of the journey at my age is terrific . The sea voyage with its attendant nausea , the exhausting journey by rail in the discomfort and heat of your trains , and , added to this , the sad knowledge that my dear mother no longer awaits with extended arms for my coming . Neither do my brothers invariably show me that consideration which they should . Particularly I mention Nicholas . Mentioning him , of course in the strictest confidence . I should like very much to have you visit me this summer duringyour holidays . Even a short stay in England at this period of your life would help to broaden you . I wish I could offer you lively society , as I might have done once , but those days-are past . They are gone like the days when my parents entertained so lavishly at Jalna . But I can offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cousin once removed . She and the aunt ( by marriage ) with whom she lives are coming from Ireland to spend part of the summer with me . Mrs. Court 's husband was the brother of Sarah 's father . They were the sons of Thomas Court , my mother 's youngest brother . Mrs. Court is an Englishwoman , though still living in Ireland , and you would never think that Sarah herself was Irish . She is twenty-five , a quite superior girl intellectually , musical like yourself . I have always esteemed the aunt , though she is a very peculiar woman and places too much importance ( in my opinion ) on her high blood pressure . I am sure you and Sarah would get on together . If you would like to visit me , I shall write to Renny and tell him that it is my desire to have you . It was such a delight to me that he and Alayne were married from my house and spent their honeymoon near by . Give my fondest love to my other dear nephews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them ) , and my baby-grandnephew . I hope you will be very happy , my dear Finch , and I think you may rest assured that not one of us harbors any feeling of malevolencetoward you in the matter of your inheritance . Your affectionate Aunt , AUGUSTA BUCKLEYP.S . Quite recently I had a letter from Eden . He approached me for money . He did not mention that woman . A. B.62 FINCH 'S FORTUNE . THE BIRTHDAY 63Finch carried the letter to Alayne where she was arranging carnations on the birthday table . " Look , Finch , " she cried , " are n't they beauties ? They arrived perfectly fresh . I arranged them at first with tulle banked about them , but it did n't suit the room at all . You ca n't do what you like with this room  --  it ' s got too much character . " Finch sniffed the carnations and eyed the expanse of damask and silver with some concern . He had never been the object of an occasion before , and the pleasure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only relations and the nearest neighbors . He said nervously , " You do n't suppose they ' 11 drink my health , do you ? Want me to make a speech or anything ? I ' d be in a blue funk if I thought that was hanging over me . " " Of course they ' 11 drink your health . All you ' ve got to do is to get up and make a little bow and say a few words of thanks . " Finch groaned . " Do n't be silly ! How can you possibly be afraid of saying a few words at your own table when you played so splendidly before a hall full of people ? " " If you think you cheer me by bringing up that recital , you ' re mistaken . I hate the thought of it ! " I do n't ! I look back on it with pride . " But she dared not look at him for fear her eyes would betray her knowledge that he had not played his best . He drew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully pretty . Where are we going to have lunch ? " " In the sitting room . It ' s ready now . " " I ' ve just had a letter from Aunt Augusta . Have you time to read it now ? " " Yes , I ' d love to . " She sat down on the arm of a chair near a window , in an attitude that suggested both repose and capability of purpose . Finch 's eyes rested on the sheen of herhair , the blue of her dress . Seeing her so , he felt , as he often felt about her , that she never had and never could become one of them , even to the fitting of her person into the surrounding ' objects of the house . She looked as though she had just walked in from a different world , bringing with her an atmosphereof clarity and questioning , and would walk out again , her clarity perhaps disturbed but her questioning unanswered . Yet she was easily agitated . Sometimes he felt a wildness of spirit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way into the fibre of their life , take possession as she was possessed . She looked up and found his eyes on her and smiled . " What a characteristic letter ! " she exclaimed . " I think her underlining is delicious . And her adjectives ! . . . Oh , my dear , what could be more perfect than malevolence ? " She turned the page and read the postscript , but she made no comment on it , except by a scornful movement of the lips . " What do you think , " asked Finch , " of my going over to visit Aunt Augusta ? I ' d like to go . I 've just told Renny that I ca n't go back to Varsity . " " How did he take it ? " She was not surprised , because they had talked of that together . But she could not speak of Renny without all her being quivering into oversensitiveness . " Just what you ' d expect . We had a row . " " Oh , I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well  --  now he knows . One unexpected thing happened . Piers took my side . " She wondered why Piers had taken his side . She suspected Piers of being shrewd and she could never be unconscious of his dislike for her , though it was concealed behind an air of heartiness . He had welcomed her even less as mistress of Jalna than he had when she had first come there as Eden 's wife . He would have liked Pheasant to be the only woman in the house , his wife , a young girl and docile , though she had been wanton once . Alayne said , " You must go to England . You must ! " 64 FINCH 'S FORTUNE THE BIRTHDAY 65She took him by the lapels of his coat and gave him a quick kiss . She realized his spiritual hunger and the kiss was a gesture , not only of comfort , but of urge to the fulfillment of that hunger . He felt a high excitement . His eyes shone . " How beautifulyou are to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know , " she said , teasingly , " I believe Aunt Augusta has it in her mind to make a match between you and this Sarah Court . " " Nonsense ! She looks on me as a boy . " " Yes , but boys grow into husbands . Especially in a house with an attractive cousin . " " I do n't like the sound of her . " " She ' s musical . " " I do n't like the sound of that . " " Well , do n't think I should want you to marry . You ought not to marry till you are fully matured . Not for years and years . " The luncheon bell sounded , and almost at once they heard voices in the sitting room . They found the others there , standing about eating roast-beef sandwiches and drinking tea . Wakefield , excited by the novelty , darted here and there , half a buttered scone in each hand . Not since his grandmother 's funeral had there been such excitement in the house . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal , and the opening of the doors to invited guests . And all about Finch ! Wakefield , for the first time in his life , regarded Finch with respect . He found a chair and , hooking his arms beneath its arms , dragged it towards his brother. " 1l ere ! " he cried , exuberantly . " I Jere ' s a chair ! Sit down and rest yourself . " There was an outburst of laughter at Finch 's expense . He pushed child and chair aside , and went , with a sheepish frown , to the table where the viands were spread . He picked up a sandwich and , before he remembered to offer the plate toAlayne , had taken a large bite from it . He attempted to get tea for her and slopped it into the saucer . He was in despair with himself . Renny was in despair with him , too . He stood watching his fumbling movements with brooding disapproval . What the devil was the matter with the fellow ? He was always wrought up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his studies the very moment of coming into his money ! It was the spinelessness of him  --  that was what was so exasperating . If only he were wild , reckless  --  but this shrinking from things ! Were these half brothers , whom he had reared , to be one disappointment after another ? All but Piers ! He ' d no fault to find with Piers . But Eden . . . . Never able to earn his own living , and yet somehow able to keep that girl , Minny . He had n't married her , though , which he ought to have done . . . . Now Finch was coming on . . . . And little Wake , who was like his own child , what would he make of him ? Ile looked gloomily at the undersizedboy with his sensitive ( lark face , his long-lashed , brillianteyes , too big for the face . . . . He ' d been caught lying , he ' d been caught stealing . . . . Well , life was a queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mournful occasion , though the others might stand about grinning with their sandwiches like a lot of school children at a feed . Nicholas thought , with an inward chuckle , " Renny might have put a better face on it , seeing that Ernest and I have achieved a festive air . After all , the party was his idea . " Finch could not get enough to eat . As usual , when he was mentally disturbed , he found the cavity within more difficult to fill , especially with a scrappy meal like this . No number of buns spread with damson jam would do it . He was the last in the room . He had hoped that Renny would linger , givinghim a chance to propitiate him , but after bolting two sandwiches , and a cup of tea that might well have seared insides of less tough fibre , Renny had stalked out. 66 FINCH 'S FORTUNEIt seemed that the afternoon would never pass . Finch hung about the house watching the preparations , playing snatches at the piano , teasing Pheasant , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that subject of never-failing interest  --  himself . He and Wakefield went to the kitchen in the basement and surveyed the fowls all trussed up for roasting , and the wineglassesall polished up for filling , and the moulds of jelly , and the buckets filled with chopped ice into which were thrust the containers holding the Neapolitan ice sent out from town . They had never seen Mrs. Wragge 's face so purple or Rags 's so , pallid , or Bessie 's arms , as she scrubbed the celery , so mottled . All were atwitter with excitement . They looked at Finch with wonder in their eyes to think that he had attained this pinnacle . Long before it was time to dress for dinner he was in his attic room . The night had turned cold . Ile got into his dressing gown , a gayly colored one that had once been Eden 's , his bedroom slippers that had once been Renny 's , took his bath towel , one of a pair given him by Meggie at Christmas , and descended to the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had told Rags to fill the tin tub with very hot water and it was hot enough in all conscience . Hot enough to boil him . When he ran upstairs again he was pink from heat and in a state of high excitement . Already he had laid his evening clothes on the bed . They had only been worn twice before , once at a dance at the Leighs ' and once at the recital . The jacket became him well , he thought , surveying himself in the small glass . Alayne had given him a white carnation to wear . He brushed his moist hair , giving special attention to the lock that had a habit of dangling on his forehead . He polished his nails and wished that his fingers were not so stained by cigarettes . A shiver ran over him which he did not know whether to attribute to excitement or the change from the hot bath to the cold room . THE BIRTHDAY 67God , how well the new cuff links and the new wrist watch looked ! He glanced at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half before dinner time ! What to do ? He could not go downstairs at this hour , looking like a fool , with a carnation in his buttonhole . Yet he should die of cold if he spent the intervening time up here . He cursed himself for his stupid haste . Still , if he chose to go down and sit for an hour and a half in the drawing-room , whose business was it but his own ? He supposed he could do as he liked on his own birthday . . . . He was halfway down the attic stairs when he heard Piers ascending the lower stairs whistling . They would meet in the passage , or Piers , glancing up , would see him on the stairway . One look at him in those clothes , at that hour , would be enough to make Piers humorous at his expense for the evening . He could hear him greet an early arrival , " Too bad you could n't have got here earlier . Young Finch has been waiting , all dressed up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , he must never risk that ! Not risk being seen by any of the family . He turned back and reentered his room . He looked at his watch . Five minutes had passed . Somehow or other he must put in the next hour and a quarter in that cavern of coldness . He looked longingly at the bed . If only he might lie down and cover himself with the quilt and keep warm ! But his suit would be ruined by wrinkles in no time . The next best thing was to wrap the quilt about him and find something to read . He folded it carefully about his shoulders , keeping one hand curved above the carnation to protect it . He felt utterly miserable . . . . What hell coming of age was ! From his shelf of books he took a volume of Wordsworth 's poems . It was handsomely bound , the only prize he had ever got at school . The support he craved , the something of pride in achievement , might be in that book , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hour . He sat down , opened it and read : " Presented to Finch Whiteoak for the excellence of his memorizing of Holy Scripture . " And the date , nine years before . He had been a small boy then , at a small school . Nine years ago . . . . He was getting on ! He thought of the numerous prizes each of the others had won at school , for they had each had a subject or two in which they excelled . As for prizes for athletics  --  they had been put to it to find places for all the silver cups and urns . . . . Well , at any rate he had got one  --  that was better than nothing. 1 le read stolidly for what seemed a long time , dividing his attention between his new cuff links and watch and the poetry , for which he did not much care . But the rhythm of it cased him somehow , the quilt comforted . It was no easy matter to keep it around him , protecting the carnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other . He did wish he had a cigarette , yet he was a fraid of disarranginghimself to get it lest in the rearranging the carnation might be injured . It might be better to take the carnation off for the time , but there was the danger in pinning it on again. l le heard Wakefield running below and gave a piercing whistle to attract him . He came flying up the stairs . Finch concealed the poems under the quilt . " Hello , " said Wakefield , " what are you wrapped up in a quilt for ? " " Been having a bath and got chilled . Look in that top drawer and hand me the package of cigarettes , like a good kid . " " I say , " exclaimed Wake , as he produced the cigarettes , " how funny you look ! You ' re wrapped in a quilt and yet I can see your pumps and pants underneath ! " Finch scowled at him in what he hoped was a terrifying way , but he dared advance no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cuffs . Yet Wake held them just out of reach . THE BIRTHDAY 69 " Give them here ! " snarled Finch out of the side of his mouth like a stage villain . " I am giving them . " Wake 's tone was meek , but his eyes were on a narrow aperture in the quilt and he brought the cigarettes no nearer . " Here they are . Why do n't you take them ? " " How the hell can I take them when you hold them away off there ? " " It ' s not away off . It ' s just a little bit of a way . What ' s the matter with you ? Do you feel sick ? Because , if you do , perhaps you ' d better not smoke . " Exasperated beyond endurance , Finch shot forth his hand from the quilt and snatched the packet of cigarettes , instantly drawing the quilt once more tightly about him . " Now , " he said , " clear out of here , and no more of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and down the stairs , so pensive was his mien . Finch felt hot all over . He let the quilt slide from his shoulders and put a cigarette between his lips . He reached for a match , but just as he struck it he heard Wakefield and Piers talking in the passage below . He held his breath and heard soft steps ascending the stairs . Like an arrow from the bow he leaped to the door . Just as Piers reached the landing he threw himself against it . He shot the bolt . Smothered laughter came from outside . " Look here , Finch , " came Piers 's voice , " can you let me have a cigarette ? " " No , " growled Finch . " Have n't got any up here . " " The kid says you have . " " He ' s a little liar . " " Well , look here , I ' d like to speak to you a minute . " " Sorry . I ca n't just now . I ' m busy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem very well when he was up before . " " Let me alone ! " roared Finch , and he showed , further-70 FINCH 'S FORTUNEmore , that the example he had had before him in the matter of swearing had not been entirely lost . When they had gone he looked down at the carnation . He had flattened it against the door . . . . He looked at his wrist watch . . . . The fracas had done one thing for him , at any rate . It had made time fly . The Vaughans were the first to arrive : Meggie , a little plumper , a little more exuberantly the wife and mother ; Maurice a trifle grayer , his masculinity a trifle more muffled . She clasped I inch to her . Oh , the lovely depth of that bosom ! Ile was never taken to it but he wished he might burrow into its tender depths and remain forever en folded there . She gave him three kisses on the mouth , and put a packet into his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wake crowded up beside him to see . It was a white evening scarf of heavy silk . " Oh , thanks , " Finch murmured , and Maurice shook him by the hand . Maurice had been warned on the way by his wife not to make any reference to Finch 's inheritance , but he could not resist saying , " Well , enjoy it while you ' re young ! " And his glance ( lid not indicate the scarf . Meg caressed Wakefield , remarked his delicate looks , and went tip to Alayne 's room to lay off her things . The men stood about with the conciliatory air worn by them in the presence of female antagonisms . They knew that Meggie and Alayne disliked each other ; that there was no love lost between Meggie and Pheasant . They would be glad when other guests arrived . They soon arrived in a stream . The Fcnncls ; the rector thickset , beaming , his hair and beard tidier than was usual even on Sundays ; George resembling him ; Mrs. I+ennel longbacked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which she might drop ; Tom resembling her . Next the two Miss Laceys , whose late father had been a retiredTHE BIRTHDAY 71Admiral , and the elder of whom had been after Nicholas fortysevenyears ago . After these Miss Pink , the organist , prematurelyaged by being rushed year in and year out through the hymns and psalms by the combined impetuosity of the Whiteoaks at a speed which she thought little short of blasphemous . She was in a flurry at exposing her shoulders in a seldom worn evening gown and had veiled them by a scarf , though they were , in truth , the best part of her . These were the old , old friends and neighbors . Considerably later and from town came the Leighs . They were mere acquaintances to the rest of the family , but Finch thought of Arthur Leigh as his best friend . Mother and daughter , in their sheathlike gowns of delicate green , had the appearance of sisters . Finch could scarcely wait to have Arthur alone that he might tell him of his contemplated trip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spending that summer in England . The party was now complete except for two people . These were neighbors , living in a small , rather isolated house , but comparative strangers . About a year and a half before , AntoineLebraux had brought his wife and daughter from Quebec and acquired this place with the object of going into the breedingof silver foxes . He had been in the Civil Service and , his health having broken clown , he was advised to turn to an outdoor life . His wife , who had relations in Upper Canada , wished to be near them , and within fifty miles of a brother she had discovered this small and neglected property for sale . Lebraux , with the enthusiasm of his race , had thrown himself heart and soul into the new life . Reliable parent foxes had been bought and he had read every book obtainable on the subject of their breeding and care . Renny had met him and liked him . He had ridden over frequently to see how the foxes were progressing . The first litters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , and his malady had shown signs of improve-72 FINCH 'S FORTUNEment . But good luck did not follow in good luck 's train . His most valuable vixen had somehow dug her way out and was never seen again . The later litters were weakly , a vixen died ; then , when fresh stock had been bought in the hope of raising the stamina , thieves had broken in and stolen the best of them . The bodies of the foxes had been found less than a mile away , stripped of their pelts . All this told on the health of Lebraux . He had become so irritable that Renny 's heart had gone out to his wife and daughter . When Lebraux had at last been confined to the house , he had begged Renny to come to him as often as possible . Ile could forget his sense of disappointment , of failure , of impending disaster in l:enny 's presence . " I like you ! " he had often exclaimed . " I like you to be near me . You and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " penny had never been told this before and it pleased him . And so they had talked of horses and foxes and women . Lebraux had taken to drinking brandy . Ile had had uncontrollableoutbreaks of despair during which he would threaten to do away with himself . Only the presence of Ronny would calm him . Often Mrs. Lehr:ix had sent her young ( laughter all the way to Jalna with a note for Renny begging him to go to her help . When , in January , Lebraux had died , Renny had spent half his time in the house . Her brother had kept out of the way as much as possible , for he shirked the responsibility that he felt was moving towards him . It had been Renny 's idea to invite the mother and daughter , an idea that had not met with much favor from the rest of the family . Mrs. Lebraux had called on Alayne soon after her marriage . The call had been returned , and there had been an end to intimacy . Alayne had felt pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The uncles had agreed with her that they were strange people . " Not at all the sort of people who used to settle here . " Meggie had not called . Piers was contemptuous of Lebraux , his failures , and whatTHE BIRTHDAY 73Piers considered his spinelessness . He made fun of Mrs. I.ebraux 's thick yellow hair that was turning dark in streaks , her round light-lashed eyes and red hands . But Renny had his way . The poor woman had never been anywhere since her husband 's death , and the little girl would keep Wake in countenance . I f Mrs. Leigh and Ada looked like sisters as they entered the drawing-room , Mrs. Lebraux and little Pauline seemed of no relation to each other . Mrs. Lebraux had a blonde , hardy , wholesome look , was the daughter of a Newfoundlanderwho had made a good deal of money in the fisheries and somehow lost it , and she resembled him . Pauline was like Lebraux , a thin , dark child of fifteen , in white , with the promise of some beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Chateau Frontenac , and had precipitatelyslid into matrimony . It was an odd , mixed party , Alayne thought , as they filed in to dinner . It was the first time she had entertained since her marriage and she was rather wrought up over it , fearful lest all should not go well . But she need not have had any apprehension on that score . Where there were Whiteoaks gathered , there was no danger of dullness . The family were all talking at once , as a garden of hardy flowers might burst into vigorous bloom at the first encouragement of the sun . A festive occasion , the prospect of a good dinner with plenty to drink with it , were sun enough for them . Ernest took in Mrs. Leigh ; Nicholas , his old flame Miss Lacey ; Vaughan , Mrs. Fennel ; Finch , Ada Leigh ; Renny , Mrs. Lebraux , with the others distributing as congenially as possible down to the two youngest , who came last , smiling gravely at each other , she half a head taller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would never be said of her that she was not a good cook . Fowls , under leer hand , shed their earthly plumage and turned into glistening forms of celestial sweetness . Her vegetables were drained74 FINCH 'S FORTUNEat the critical moment , the pastry was light . Only her puddingwas heavy , and there was no pudding to-night . Wakefieldcould scarcely credit his own senses when he saw all the best china and silver on the table at once . Things that usually lived in cabinets behind glass were now on the table looking as though they were used every day . Several wineglasses were clustered at each place , even his own and Pauline 's . " Have you ever been to anything like this before ? " he asked her , trying to feel not too important . " No . Is n't it lovely ? " She smiled , and he thought how prettily her lip curled from her little white teeth . He noticed her long white hands , then stared at her mother across the table . " You do n't look a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin above his Eton collar . " No , I look like my daddy . " She stopped eating and withdrew into herself , a look of sad remoteness shadowing her small face . " My father , " he observed , looking hard at her , " died before I was born . " She was startled into regarding him with an almost fearful interest . " Did he really ? I did n't know they could . I always thought you had to have both father and mother when you were born . " " I did n't . My father was dead and my mother died when I was born . " She breathed , " How awful for you ! " He agreed . " Yes , " he said . " I ' m what is called a posthumous child . I think it has preyed on my mind . I think it is what has made me so delicate . I ' m not able to go to school , you know . I go to Mr. Fennel for lessons , but I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I could go to him , too . That would be nice , would n't it ? " THE BIRTHDAY 75He looked dubious . " Yes  --  but you ' re a Catholic , are n't you ? " She nodded . " But Mother is n't . I do n't believe she ' d mind . Do you think he ' d have me ? " " Well , he might . If you ' d promise not to try to convert me or anything . He ' d not like to risk that . " " Oh , I ' d promise ! " Around the table , conversation flowed easily . Alayne perhapswas less at ease than the others . She was so anxious that things should go well , especially because of the Leighs . Rags was a constant irritation to her . His shabby trigness , his air of anxiety over the two hired maids , his bending over Renny to whisper to him with an expression of portentous significance . And why did Renny grin up at him in that way ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mealtime . Rags seemed always to be hovering behind his chair like an evil genius , and Renny never looked more like his grandmother than when he was grinning up at Rags . What was he saying to that Mrs. Lebraux ? She strained her ears to catch the words . He was saying , " Well , I ' 11 be very grateful if you will let me have the use of your stable . I could keep two horses there . We ' re terribly short of room , as it is . " Mr. Fennel , on the other side of Mrs. Lebraux , joined in . " I am glad to hear that you are staying on in your house , Mrs. Lebraux . I do hope you are comfortable . " She turned her round , pale-lashed eyes on him . " Comfortable ! No , I ' m not very comfortable . But I ' m getting along somehow . . . " Then Ernest 's musical voice came to Alayne . He was saying to Mrs. Leigh , " Yes , I ' m doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it for many years now . One ca n't hurry with that sort of thing . But I do feel that the result will be . . . " Nicholas was booming to his old flame , Miss Lacey , " He ' s76 FINCH 'S FORTUNE = THE BIRTHDAY 77never talked since she died . Is n't it extraordinary ? There he sits on his perch , in her room , just brooding . " Then came Meg 's voice , as she claimed Mr. Fennel 's attention . " You ' d never believe the things she does and says . Sometimes she quite frightens me . Only this morning , she said , Mummy , I want to see God ! " Pheasant and Arthur Leigh were laughing together . She was saying , " lint , truly , I know a man who saw a twoheadedfoal . . . " Finch 's head was inclined toward Ada Leigh . Alayne caught just a snatch : " Oh , I dare say I ' 11 travel round a bit . You ca n't stick in one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought . From all about her their voices came , and yet their plates were the first to he swept clean of each course . They seldom asked a question . They took their world as they found it , without curiosity . Only Piers and Miss Pink , whom he had taken in , did not trouble to speak , but were devoting themselves to the business of eating and drinking . She lived alone and her great economy was food . Now she had allowed her gauze scarf to slide from her shoulders , for even it had seemed to impede her progress toward repletion . Piers was drinking a good deal . 1 l is lips were taking on that sweet , mysteriouscurve they had when he was becoming oblivious of his surroundings , and only wished to be left alone that he might give his full attention to the pleasant phenomenon that was taking place inside him . There was champagne . Nicholas had seen to that . Rags could not have been more solemn about the drawing of the corks if he had bought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intangible but vital drew them all nearer to each other . The fingers of their spirits touched . Mr. Fennel rose , glass in hand , to propose Finch 's health . Finch saw it coming and drooped still closer to Ada Leigh forsupport . His hour had struck . He was twenty-one , and Mr. Fennel was going to propose his health . The confusion of voices sank into a gentle sigh . All eyes , made brighter or dreamier by wine , were turned on the rector  --  all eyes with the exception of Piers 's , which were looking into a tranced and pleasing space . Mr. Fennel said :  --  " What I am about to do is very agreeable to me . That is to propose the health of a member of this household who to-day has reached the estate of manhood . It is not easy for me to believe this because it seems only a few years ago since I held him in my arms at the font and baptized him in the church his grandfather had built . His grandfather had built the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . He established there the religion of his fathers . And his descendants have never failed in their support of that church . At Jalna he established a family which preservesto-day the traditions of a fine old English family , as few families do in these times of standardization and irreverencefor tradition . . . . The memory of his devoted wife  --  whose presence I seem to feel among us to-night  --  will long remain fresh in the minds of all who knew her . Her faults  --  for none of us are perfect  --  were far outdone by her virtues . . . . This member of her family who has just attained the age of twenty-one  --  an age that seems quite unbelievably fresh and glowing to me  --  has been the companionof my sons all his life . With them he has run in and out of the rectory a thousand times on the mysterious quests of boyhood . In their room they have held with him innumerableconferences on the mysterious business of youth . He has enlivened many an evening for us with his music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of us have ever known him to do a cruel or shabby thing . I wish him well from the bottom of my heart . I know you will all join me in this . I give you the toast  --  Finch Whiteoak ! " 78 FINCH 'S FORTUNEMr . Fennel sat down with the unruffled air of a man who had just as lief make a speech as not . Finch crouched between Ada Leigh and his sister-in-law Alayne with the air of a man to whom the making of a speech would be a task of appalling torture . The heads of those about him swam toward him goggle-eyed like goldfish in a round glass bowl . There was clapping of hands , glasses clinked . The glass of the bowl shivered into splinters and Finch was left gasping , looking piteously like a stranded goldfishhimself , trying to rise to his feet . Ada Leigh smiled soft encouragement . She said , " It will be all right . Just anything that comes into your head  --  now ! " She touched his arm with an impelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding . " Up you get , Finch ! " and others added jovially , " Speech , speech ! " But it was Alayne who got him to his feet . Her father and her grandfathers had been New England professors , monitors of the young . Out of the background of their authority , her blue-gray eyes looked dominantly into his , saying , " Rise and give tongue ! " Her fingers clutched his under the tablecloth so tightly that it hurt . He twisted his own about them as he spoke . I-Iow different this was from doing a part in a play ! Then , in velvet cloak or in vagabond tatters , he could abandon himself to the portrayal of another 's moods . But now he was simply his naked self , and a dozen words were harder to get out than a torrent of talk on the stage . He heard his voice with a curious kind of croak in it . " I t ' s fright fully good of you  --  all . I never had such nice things said about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite know what to do about it . Mr. Fennel and Mrs. Fennel could n't possibly have been kinder to me if I ' d been their own son  --  and , of course , everyone present  --  has beenthe same  --  " THE BIRTHDAY 79 " Hear , hear , " said Piers , without moving his lips . " I ca n't tell you how much I am enjoying  --  this occasion , " he continued , looking the picture of despair . " If I should live to be as old as my grandmother  --  " " You ' 11 never do it , " interrupted Piers , without any appearance of having spoken . Renny threw Piers a fiery look down the table . " I ' d never forget this dinner  --  and I do most heartily  --  " here his voice broke  --  " thank you . I hope no one here will ever be sorry that  --  sorry that  --  " Good Lord , what was he about to say ? Sorry that what ? Oh , yes , sorry that Gran had left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be horrible . But what could he say ? " Hope no one here will ever live to be sorry  --  " he stammered , and soughtthe ruddy sunrise of Piers 's face for inspiration ; " be sorry  --  " " That we let you live till you were twenty-one , " supplied Piers without seeming to utter a word . There was a burst of hilarious applause . The hero of the occasion sat clown . He took a gulp of champagne . " You did splendidly , " whispered Ada Leigh , and Alayne squeezed his fingers before she uncurled hers from them . Hewas flushed , and happily conscious that he might have doneworse . He had been delighted at the burst of applause and laughter , though he could not quite recall what he had said that was so witty . After the speeches , voices rose to a babble . The faces about the table were changed to a noticeable degree . Those which were ordinarily vivacious became dreamy , those which were usually somewhat stolid were transfigured into liveliness . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings of maids , unbelievably trig . Rags drifted ceaselessly around the table refilling glasses , the creator , it seemed , of this animation , these changes of expression , this8o FINCH 'S FORTUNE THE BIRTHDAY 8rbabble . Ernest had got to the point of telling Mrs. Leigh of his life in old London , the times he and Nicholas had had . Nicholas had reached the point of intimating to Miss Lacey , by look rather than by word , that he wished he and she might have been joined together in wedlock , rather than he and that other from whom he was divorced . Renny and Mrs. Lebraux were engaged in a low earnest conversation which excluded the existence of all others . Piers had picked up Miss Pink 's gauze scarf from the floor where it had fallen and laid it about his own shoulders . He , only , did not talk , but his lips were curved in that same enigmatic , Mona Lisa smile . The rugs had been taken up in the drawing-room and hall and the floor waxed , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was George Fennel who sat down at the piano , very square , very upright , his hands drawing insidious sweetness from the keys . The latest dances from the world of jazz were tossed by George as invitation to this mixed company , some of whom still danced in the style of forty years ago . And how gallantly they responded to the invitation ! They thought it " queer stuff  --  very modern , you know  --  and not at all easy to keep step with . " Ent somehow they contrived to do it , the couples moving in small circles , conversinglightly and gayly all the while . Nicholas and Ernest with the two Miss Laceys , with whom they had danced the quadrille , the polka , and the schottische on this very floor , when they were young men and girls . Mr. Fennel had Pheasant tightly clasped to him , his beard now and again tickling her bare shoulder . Like a captive bird she cast wistful glances at her mate , wishing she might fly down the room , with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there he was dancing with Miss Pink , who was quite old enough to be his mother ! The younger men had no flowers of speech to offer to their partners . Up and down the drawing-room , in and out of thehall they moved , their faces as void of expression as a clean slate , their very souls set in the mould of jazz . Miss Pink had been afraid she could not do it . But when once Piers had got hold of her she found that she could , and not only that , but she wished she might go on doing it forever . As for Piers , he scarcely knew whom he was dancing with  --  old or young , skillful or amateurish , it did not signify . She had been at hand when his forceful body had responded to the inexorable call of the dance . Alayne was dancing with graceful Arthur Leigh . Wakefieldhad almost more than he could cope with in Meggie 's solid frame . Meg had an eye on Maurice and Mrs. Leigh , who seemed to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to ask Ada Leigh to dance , but had turned away as he saw Tom Fennel loping towards her . He must not be selfish at his own party . With whom would he dance , then ? He looked rather vaguely about the room . There was Mrs. Fennel in a comfortable chair near the fire with a dish of crystallized fruit beside her . And in the farthest corner , on the settee , was Mrs. Lebraux in her black dress , with Renny keeping her company , his back half turned to the dancers . And staring into the cabinet of curios from India was the Lebraux child , her skirt too short , her legs too long , and the back of her head looking as though it needed combing . Her hair stuck out in thick black tufts , giving her an odd , elfin look . He went to her and said , " Would you like to dance , Pauline ? " She glanced at him over her shoulder and shook her head . " Can you dance ? " He felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cabinet again , but she answered , in a low voice , " Yes . But I do n't think I should . Mother is n't . " 82 FINCH 'S FORTUNE " I see . But you ' re such a kid I do n't think she ' d mind . Shall I ask her ? " She turned quickly and looked at him searchingly , as though wondering whether or no she would like to dance with him . Then she went sedately to her mother and bent over her . She came back smiling and put her hand into hinch 's . " It ' s all right . Both Mother and Mr. Whiteoak say to dance . " 1icr face lit up and she moved her shoulders as though eager to begin . She was so thin that she felt like nothing more than a wand in hinch 's arms , yet there was a wild strength in her movements. lle thought she was like a little breeze-blown boat tugging at its anchor . The music was swift , even feverish , for this second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bent to look into her face . He had scarcely seen her , yet he had the impression of beauty . He saw the thick hair above the low forehead , with its penciled brows , the eyelids that had a foreign look , the half-closed eyes , of which he could not make out the color , the childish nose , the wide , rather thin-lipped mouth with its upward curve at the corners , the little white chin , the long graceful neck . He could not tell where the beauty was , but he was satisfied that it was there or would be there . " Who taught you to dance ? " he asked . " Oh , I had lessons in Quebec . Daddy and I used to dance alot together . I can dance alone , too . Solo ( lances , you know . " " How splendid ! I wish you ' d dance one to-night . " " Oh , no , I could n't !

" " Are n't you afraid the foxes will eat the poultry ? " " That shows how much you know about it ! They ' re kept absolutely separate . " " It will mean a lot of work . " " We do n't mind that , if only we can make it pay . " I Ier slender body seemed to tighten with resolve . She swayed and dipped and turned like a bird , he thought . And she had a hard time before her , he was afraid . He would like to help them if he only knew how to go about it . This having so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a troublingsense of responsibility toward one 's fellows . " Mother and I do all the housework , " she was saying , " dishwashing , sweeping , and everything . She does outdoor work , too . She ' s awfully strong . " " Do you really ? " He was astonished , for he had never seen his sister do anything but take care of herself , and Alayne and Pheasant were very much the same , except that Pheasant looked after Mooey , and that none too well , he thought . He saw Ada Leigh watching them , and he wondered what she thought of the child . When at last they danced together , and he had reproached her , as he had a feeling she wanted him to do , for having eluded him , he asked her . " I could not help being amused by the pair of you , " she answered , " you looked so odd together . " " Did we ? " He was a little nettled . " Well , I suppose I look odd at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging looks . " Not at all ! You do n't look odd dancing with me , I ' m very sure . But that girl is almost ridiculous , with her hair and her terrifically long thin legs . And that sort of do-or-die look . " " Well , she may look queer dancing , but it ' s like heaven to dance with her ! " 84 FINCH 'S FORTUNE " I ' m so glad , because one gets so little of heaven here on earth , does n't one ? " Finch observed solemnly , " I ' m afraid she ' s going to be one of those women that other women do n't like . " " Oh , I do n't think you need worry about that . " " I ' m not worrying . Why should I worry about it ? " " I do n't know , I ' m sure . But you are . " " No , I ' ni not . " " Yes , you are . " " All I feel is great pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I ' m afraid they ' 11 have a harder . " " What a strange-looking woman Mrs. Lebraux is ! " " Yes , rather .

" " I do , " said Ada . " I love her . " " For heaven 's sake ! Why ? " " Because she lets you alone and devotes herself to your brother . " " But she 's years and years older than I am . " " I low clever of you to have found that out ! I should have expected you to insist that she was younger , you ' re so chiv-alrous . " " And you ' re so detestable ! " They stopped dancing . They were in the dark end of the hall , alone . They clung to each other a moment , motionless . Then he took her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . She lay there acquiescent , the perfume of her going through all his nerves as the champagne had . She was like champagne , cool , softly stinging , potent to the senses . They began to ( lance again as smoothly as though they had never lost a beat when Renny , with the little Lebraux , glided into the hall . It seemed to Finch that Renny cast a sharp look at Ada , as though he suspected her of something , THE BIRTHDAY 85and he had a curious feeling that Ada would rather have been kissed by Renny than by him , even though she had been more than acquiescent , had kissed him back . Pauline 's lips were parted in a joyful smile , showing her very white teeth ; she clutched Renny 's sleeve in one thin white hand . Her expression was that of a young creature that has been unhappy far too long , and snatches at some sudden pleasure with almost fierce desire . She and her mother left early . Then the Leighs , with a long motor ride before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laceys and Miss Pink into their car . The Vaughans were the last to go . " And I really do n't care very much about trusting myself to him in a car , the way he is , " Meg said . Renny looked his brother-in-law over . " He ' 11 be all right after a breath of fresh air , " he assured her . " I ' 11 open the window on him . " Maurice watched this move for his revivification with interest . As soon as the window was opened he started the car and it sped across the lawn , scraping the end of an icecoveredgarden seat , and on three wheels gained the drive . Nicholas was declaiming in the drawing-room . " I might never have had gout in my life , I was so free from it to-night . As lively as a three-year-old . " " And I , " said Ernest , " never thought of my dinner again . And I ate everything ! " " It ' s remarkable what exhilaration does .

" " Still , " protested Ernest , balancing himself on the balls of his feet , " they are a charming family , the Leighs . And really intellectual . " " To me too ! " cried Pheasant . " I do n't agree , " said Alayne . " To me they seem very superficial . " Finch interrupted , hurt for his friend 's sake . " Not Arthur . Arthur ' s absolutely sound . " " I ' d like to give him a sound hiding , " observed Renny , lighting his pipe , " and knock some of the effeminacy out of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pheasant . I. enny took her by the nape and rumpled her hair into a brown crest . " Mrs. Leigh , " said Ernest , " was greatly interested in my annotation of Shakespeare . " his two nieces by marriage regarded hint pityingly . The two young women went , as with one impulse , to the mirror above the mantel that had reflected so many Jalna scenes , and examined themselves in the glass . The five men looked at their backs and the reflection of their faces with incurious interest . They were interested , as always , in this mani festation of sex , but they knew such manifesta- tions too well to feel the sting of curiosity . Alayne said , turning round to them , " It was rather a nuisance Mrs. Lebraux not dancing . It kept one of the best dancers always at her side entertaining her . " Neither Nicholas nor Ernest had sat by Mrs. Lebraux , consequently they felt a little irritated by this remark . Ernest said , " I talked to her for a moment , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say I admire her . " " I should n't have minded sitting by her for a bit , " said Nicholas , " but she seemed not to lack attention . " He looked at Renny . THE BIRTHDAY 87Renny looked back . " Someone had to he decent to the poor woman . The girls were awfully cool to her . " " I scarcely know her , " said Alayne . " That is no reason why you should be cool to her , " returnedRenny . " She ' s one of those women , " asserted Pheasant sagaciously , " who do n't care a bit about other women . She ' s simply mad about men ! " " How unjust you are , " said Renny . " She ' s been in great trouble . She only likes to talk to me because she is used to me  --  I ' ve been a friend of Lebraux .

" She ' d never do anything to her hair . She ' s not that sort . She never thinks of her personal appearance . " His wife and his sister-in-law looked at him with pitying scorn . " Well , she spent about ten minutes on her face in the dressingroom ! " cried Pheasant . " Dear me , " said Ernest , " what was she doing to it ? " " Wiping her tears away , " suggested Piers . " Tears ! " scoffed Pheasant . " Mrs. Patch , who helped nurse Mr. Lebraux , told Mrs. Wragge that they quarreled half the time and the other half they did n't speak . " " You ' ve little to do , " said Renny , " to be gossiping with the servants about Mrs. Lebraux . " " I was n't gossiping . She just told me .

" She looks healthy , " said Nicholas . " Such crude health lacks charm for me , " said Ernest. 88 FINCH 'S FORTUNE " Renny only danced once this evening , " observed Pheasant , " and that was with her child . " " I had hoped , " said Alayne slowly , " that no one had noticed that . " " Heigho ! " said Piers , in an endeavor to imitate his grandmother . " I want something more to eat . I want it right away . " His Uncle Ernest looked at him reprovingly . " Is it possible , Piers , that you are mimicking my mother ? " " Oh , no , " answered Piers , innocently .

She ran over to him and bent her head to his ear . " Do n't be silly , darling ! And please , please , do n't drink much more !

She felt definitely unhappy , tired in spirit yet restless in body . She fidgeted about the room , exposing , with a touch of self-pity , her bare arms and shoulders to its chill air . How often during the day she had looked forward to dancing with Renny that evening ! And he had danced only once , and then with a child . Then , when the guests were gone , he had taken on that protectivetone about Mrs. Lebraux . Just because she had chosen to lean on him !

But she still retained her posture , and stood before him , hands raised as though in wonder . His brows flew up . " Well  --  you here , Alayne !

The new mauve silk bedspread caught and held the light like a dreaming pool in a wood . The moon was sinking . Its last rays were shining into the dining room , too .

" " Absolutely . From the moment you rose to your feet , you were , as the Italians say , per bene . " " Meaning , " said Piers , " full of beans . " " Exactly . " Finch half filled his glass with Black and White and aimed a squirt of soda water at it . " I think , just among ourselves , that I may say that my aim is to live an unselfish life .

" " What form , " asked Nicholas , " is your unselfishness goingto take ? " " I should suggest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Finch turned toward him somewhat truculently . " What do you mean , a pool of it ? " Piers pondered a moment , and then said : " Your unselfishness , of course . Sunshine idea . A brighter Jalna . " " Do n't be silly , " said Finch . " I ' m in dead earnest . Iwant to do something for each one of you , and that ' s a fact . " " Say it in writing , " put in Piers . " My word is as good as  --  " " Of course it is , " said Nicholas . " We all know it is . " Finch proceeded : " I ' m very glad that Renny has n't joinedus , because he never seems to see eye to eye with me in any-thing . " " Where is he ? " asked Ernest . " I had n't missed him before . Indeed , I quite thought he was here . " He peered about the room . " Been sent to bed , " said Piers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

" Me too ! " said Piers . " What are you going to do forme ? " " What should you choose ? " " Give me time . Let me sleep on it . " " It ' s settled then , is it ? You two are coming with me to visit Aunt Augusta ? " Ernest squeezed the hand he held , the hour , his condition , the invitation , filling him with an almost overwhelming emotion . Nicholas accepted airily , as though he were bestowing a favor . " I will take you to some of my old haunts in London , " he promised , straightening his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncles then began to talk about the years they had spent in England , repeating , at first , incidents that the nephews had heard before , but as the night drew on , and as the decanter emptied , drawing from remote places in their memories events unrecalled in years , like forgotten birds ' nests dragged forth from an old belfry , or rusty anchors drawn up from the deep . Some of these memories were disgraceful , and in the tellingof them the two elders became more and more youthful , breaking into sudden uncontrolled laughter , their speech fallinginto the catchwords of their day . The young men , on the contrary , grew graver and more judicial with each glass , looking as though they did not quite approve of the levity of the others , Finch even going to the length once of giving some sound advice . In order that he might hurt no one 's feelings , he addressed the advice to the siphon in a kind of chant , and when no one gave any heed to him he shed a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing they must , he was94 FINCH 'S FORTUNEready . Ernest , who loved very old songs , ballads , madrigals , and the like , began " Sumer is icumen in , " in his still excellentvoice . A tenor , a lusty barytone , and a bass joined in with " Loudly sing , cuckoo ! Grows the seed , and blows the mead , And springs the wood anew . Sing , cuckoo ! The ewe is bleating for her lamb : Lows for her calf the cow . " The bleating and the lowing , so loud and mellow , brought a fifth member of the family on the scene . This was Renny , clad in dressing gown and slippers . He stared at the revelers with ironical amusement . " Well , " he said , " you ' re a lovely-looking lot ! " The moon was gone , and the dawn creeping in showed them wan and disheveled in their evening clothes . " You ' 11 wake the women and the kids , " he said . " They 've been asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ? " " T ' ve made serious decision , " said Finch . " What ? " " To go to bed . " To Ernest it seemed positively portentous that Sasha should die just before his departure for England . It was as though she had comprehended what the state of his mind must be at the thought of parting from her . She was fourteen years old , and , though she seemed to be in perfect health , she requiredcertain luxuries , certain attentions , to keep her so . On whom could Ernest have depended to care for her ? Alayne had promised , but her attitude towards all animals was detached . Pheasant might have done very well ; but , there was Mooey , always at hand to lift Sasha up by the wrong part or to roll on her as she slept before the fire .. That left a choice among Wakefield , the Wragges , and Bessie the kitchenmaid . Ernest shivered before the choice and almost felt that he should not go . As he fondled her with concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . She was standing on him , rhythmically kneading his stomach with her forepaws , as she so often did . Ile fancied , half whimsically , that she was aware of his weak digestion and that she held the belief that gentle massage , such as she gave him , would benefit him . The benign expression she wore , when she kneaded him thus , encouraged the belief . Now to the expression of benignity was added the look of understanding . The very next morning he had found her dead on his eiderdown . Curled up , as though sleeping , with a look of blissful peace  --  but dead . It was as though she had not been able to bear the anxiety in his eyes and had willed her spirit to departin the night , setting him free from the claims of love . He had lain back again , pulled the covers over his head , 96 FINCH 'S FORTUNE and felt much shaken . He remembered the morning she had had her last kitten on this very bed . Just given one yell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had it , about six o'clock in the morning . He remembered when she had been given to him by one of the Lacey girls fourteen years before , a tiny golden ball of sportiveness . He had been rather bored then at the thought of owning a kitten , had not much wanted her . . . . A clog had killed her last kitten , and now she was gone . . . . Everyone was sympathetic . They had dug a grave for her in the prettiest corner of the garden , just where the old stone urn marked the spot . Wakefield had filled the grave with marsh marigolds and had curled her beautiful tail about her like a plume . Ernest thought that Nicholas was very callous in the leaving of Nip . Nip , to be sure , was not so fine-fihred as Sasha , but still he merited something more than the brief injunction thrown off by Nicholas at the supper table , on the night before departure , " For heaven 's sake , look after Nip ! " That had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two months just passed had flown for them all . The spring had been backward , then forward . Their spirits had been up , then down . It was such an upheaval . At first the mere stupendousness of it had been exhilarating . But later , the thought of how they would be scattered was like a hover- ing cloud . Augusta was in England ; Eden was in France or England , no one knew which ; and soon Nicholas , Ernest , and Finch would be on the ocean . They felt afresh the blank left by the death of old Adeline . When old steamer trunks were carried down from the attic , rubbed up , and new labels written for them , all felt definitely that the moment was at hand New luggage was bought by Finch . He had paid much more for it than he thought was neces- sary , but Arthur Leigh had been with him when he bought it THE DEPARTURE 97and had insisted on the best . Finch was afraid of what Renny might say about such an expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finch had announced his intention of going no more to the University , Renny , after his first outburst , had been cold toward him . Piers , on the other hand , had been warmer than ever before . But neither one would give him any advice about his money . If he approached Renny with , " I say , George Fennel thinks I ought to invest something in New York stocks and not be satisfied with such a low rate of interest , " Renny would shrug and say , " It ' s none of my business . Do as you like with it . " And he would turn away . If Finch sounded Piers on the same subject , Piers would laugh and say , " You ' re going to have the time of your young life , are n't you ? " And if Finch persisted he might add , " Well , George ought to know something about it  --  he ' s in the business . I should think it would be rather fun to speculate a bit . " Finch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After being constantly supervised in his spending , ordered here and there , sometimes tyrannized over , this suddenthrusting on him of responsibility bewildered him , skimmed the cream of his pleasure in his inheritance . It was as though they had formed a conspiracy against him . His uncles never referred to the money in his presence . It was as though they said , " By hook or crook , he got what we should have had . Now let us see what he will do with it . " He had been almost frightened when the bank book had been put into his hand , when he had interviewed the bank manager and been shown the list of Gran 's solid and conservative investments . But George had scoffed at them . George had said that , aided by one versed in the fluctuations of the market , Finch might with " speculation " double his fortune . His head was in a whirl . It felt hot most of the time . He found that he could not quiet his nerves by playing the piano ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His spirit , like a98 FINCH 'S FORTUNEcaptive bird that had been wont to sing in captivity , now found itself baffled in its freedom , beating itself against the walls of change . Alayne realized something of his bewilderment , his loneliness . They had several long talks . She felt anxiety at the thought of his giving up old Adeline 's safe investments for more spectacular ones , on the advice of George Fennel . Yet , like Finch , her imagination was captured by the thought that he might greatly increase his capital by careful speculation . George had offered some tempting suggestions and she had heard from American friends who had made large sums of late . She wrote to the head of the New York publishing house for which she had been a reader and asked his advice . Ills reply was an effort to stress cautiousness , but he could not conceal jubilation over the result of his own recent investments . In the same week came a letter from Miss Trent , with whom she had shared an apartment in New York , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two uncles , Maurice Vaughan , were children , she thought , in mattersof business . To be sure , the first two exhibited a certain shrewdness in their own province , but she had seen and heard so much of mismanagement at Jalna ; there was no use in consultingthem . And added to their incompetence was their disinclination even to speak of Finch 's inheritance . If , in some unexpected way , the subject of the grandmother 's money came up , a feeling of tension was at once apparent . They shied at the mention of it , as skittish horses will shy at their own gatepost . Alayne took her own small capital , left her by her father , out of the government stocks where it had been invested and bought Universal Autos with it . When the stock began to rise steadily , she could not resist telling Finch what she had done , and after that it was impossible for her to restrain him . But she made him tell Renny of the project . " Invest it as you like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know anything about stocks . I ' ve never had anything to invest . " Finch knew that it was not jealousy that made Renny curt , but anger that he should have , at the instant of attaining his majority , refused to return to the University . This prompt refusal had symbolized , to Renny , the rejection by Finch of all further authority , of supervision by him as the head of the clan . How bitter Meg Vaughan would be , Alayne thought , if Finch were to lose even a small amount of money by followingher example . Meg had always regarded her as an interloper , and to have some tangible injury to lay at Alayne 's door would give her real satisfaction . Finch must go , therefore , and talk the matter over with the Vaughans . He was not loath to do this , even though he was afraid they would discourage the investment . He was in a condition of sensitivenesswhich made him desirous of discussing his affairs with anyone who was willing to do so . Himself and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast importance , looming above all other subjects . Within an hour after it was decided that he should go to Vaughanlands he was on his way . There was no doubt about the arrival of spring , but as yet no manifestation of it was visible in the landscape beyond an indefinite swelling of tiny leaf buds which gave the trees the appearance of being seen behind a veil . Or , like love unrecognized , it had come , causing the heart to turn , but as yet making little difference in the outward life . It was midday , and the cup-like formation in which the house stood had caught and held the sun . The windows were open to it , and certain pillows , curtains , and draperies piled on the sills gave evidence that spring cleaning was in full progress . He found his sister covering a cushion with new cretonne in a design of tulips and delphiniums . Her white hands moved softly above it like two plump pigeons in a gay bit of garden. 100 FINCH 'S FORTUNEShe wore a pink and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave her the appearance of being hard at work . Vaughan , who made no pretense of working , lay stretched on a sofa reading a book on fox breeding . Since Lebraux had died and there was a good chance that Mrs. Lebraux would give it up , he had entertained thoughts of buying her stock himself . " Well , Finch dear , " exclaimed Meg , " so you thought you would cone to see me ! Lt ' s about time . When I think how little I see of my brothers it makes me quite sad . " She held up her smooth face expectantly . As Finch bent to kiss her his unruly forelock fell across her eyes . Ile kissed her repeatedly , smelling the warm sweetnessof her flesh and the peculiar stinging odor of the new cretonne . " I-low untidy you look ! " she said , surveying him . " I always do , do n't I ? Hello , Maurice ! You seem pressed for time . " Vaughan answered good-naturedly , " I ' m digging into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lebraux is going to sell her stock . " " I have n't heard that . I think she really has nothing else to do for a living . Between the rent and the doctor 's bills I guess she ' s had a pretty hard time . " " I feel frightfully sorry for her , " said Meg . " She ' s a thoroughly nice woman . So sensible , and not spoiled a bit by having married a Frenchman . And settling down here with her child as though she ' d always been  --  " She bit her thread with a certain sharp tooth she used for this purpose . She had been quick to perceive that neither Pheasant nor Alayne liked Mrs. Lebraux and her own feeling toward her had warmed accordingly . Her husband and her brother watched her with wonder and approval . Meggie was perfect , mysterious , richly feminine , kind .

" You and she were like two fairies dancing together ! " " Thanks so much , Meggie . It ' s pleasant to hear that I look like a fairy . " " Well , you do , dancing . " She plumped the cushion with soft thumps , held it up for admiration , then sank back to rest . " Now tell me just what is going on at home . Getting ready for the trip , I suppose . To think that I have never been across to the Old Country , and now you  --  at your age ! Able to travel as luxuriously as you like . And Uncle Nick and Uncle Ernest at their age ! And all their expenses paid . And here are Maurice and I with the mortgage falling due ! " " Oh , well , " growled Vaughan , " it can be renewed . " It was not an auspicious moment , Finch thought , for asking advice about his own investments . He pulled at his lip doubtfully , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a silence , Meg said , wistfully , " I suppose you would not care to take over the mortgage yourself ? " Finch stared , startled . " Me ? I 've never thought about it . " " Of course not . " She looked into his eyes , smiling at j his boyishness . " But mortgages are a good investment , are n't they , Maurice ? " " I wish I owned a few , " answered Maurice . " What interest do you pay ? " asked Finch . " Seven per cent . " " Great Scott ! I get only four per cent on some of mine ! " " How much happier I should feel , " cried Meg , " if you held the mortgage in place of the old wretch who does ! " " There would be no need for sentiment to enter into it , on Finch 's side , " put in Vaughan quickly . " This is a valuable property . And bound to be more valuable . Look at the oldIo2 FINCH 'S FORTUNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fancy price for that . One of these days we shall be able to subdivide this and sell it in town lots . " " Good heavens , you would n't do that ! Renny would never speak to you again . " " Well , I might never do it . But Patience might when she grows up . " Finch asked , nervously , " What is the mortgage ? " " Fifteen thousand . At seven per cent  --  one thousand and fifty ayear  --  paid half yearly . " Meg sighed , " And the old wretch is so detestable always ! " " Why ? " asked Finch . " Oh  --  I do n't know  --  " Maurice interrupted her . " Meggie ' s too critical . He has rough manners  --  that ' s all that ' s really wrong . He ' s not such a bad old fellow .

She made as if to rise and go to him , but even in a moment of emotion such as this the effort was too great . Instead , she said again , " You darling ! " and held out her arms to him . Finch crossed to her rather shamefacedly . He did not want to be thanked . But it was wonderful , this doing things for people and benefiting himself at the same time . Again Meg embraced him , pressed her plump lips on his . " I do n't believe we ' 11 tell the others a thing about it , " she said . " I do like privacy about my own affairs , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They made all the arrangements , and when they were corn- THE DEPARTURE 103plete Finch sought advice on the subject of the New York stock . Meg and Maurice threw themselves into the discussion of it with enthusiasm . He would be a fool , they said , not to take advantage of such an opportunity . Why should Americans have all the money in the world ? And if they had got it , why should they be allowed to keep it ? Finch could not do better than to bring some of it here where it was so badly needed . He might become a rich man . And there was surely little danger when heads of publishing houses who were right on the spot considered it a good thing . " If Alayne , " said Meg , " is going into it , you ' re safe . I never knew a more calculating person . To me she ' s the very embodiment of shrewdness . " " She was n't very shrewd when she married Eden , " observedMaurice . " Maurice , how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewdness , it was then ! Who was she ? Nobody ! He took her out of an office and brought her to Jalna  --  to a life of ease . He made a L1'Iaitcoak of her !

Poor lamb , he had n't a chance against her ! " The two men sighed simultaneously in the effort of picturing the red fox Renny as a helpless lamb . Patience , now within a few months of three , came running into the room . She was vivacious as Mooey was grave . Her light brown hair lay sleek on her head ; her frock was bright blue . " Baby darling , " said Meg , as Finch picked up the child , " you must put your arms right round Uncle Finch 's neck and give him a perfectly ' normous hug !

" asked Finch , to cover his embarrassment . Talking to Piers that afternoon , Finch could not forbear dropping a hint about the taking over of the mortgage on Vaughanlands . Piers was curious , and after binding him to secrecy Finch told all . Piers thought it a very good thing for both parties . " But mind you make them toe the mark with the payments , " he advised . " Maurice is more than a little slack in money matters . He owed me for two years for a Jersey bu11 he hought and I only got the money lately by keepingright after him .

" He went on complainingly , " I do n't know what ' s the matter with you chaps ! You ' d think the money was tainted or something , you ' re so shy of it ! " Piers stopped , and turned to Finch . " Well , if you want to make me a present that wo n't break you , buy me a new motor car . The old one is literally falling to pieces , and as long as the engine has a kick in it Renny wo n't buy a new one . " " Good ! " cried Finch . " I ' m awfully glad you thought of that . And Pheasant will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose one ? " Piers made short work of choosing a car . He knew exactly what he wanted , down to the smallest detail .

I t would be hard to say which of them enjoyed the drive most ; Finch , sitting with folded arms , feeling , he could not have tolc1 why , rather like a self-made man rich enough at last to indulge in the pleasure of philanthropy , or Piers , with a small , set grin on his face , entranced at the prospect of flying sweetly at fifty miles an hour . They talked little on the way , but , by the time they reached Jalna , Finch had promised to reshingle the barn for Piers and to build him an up-to-date piggery .

But Wakefield was dubious . " I do n't believe , " he said , " that my grandmother would approve . She never liked the old car . She thought buying it was a great waste of money . " Piers answered , " She ' s not here to worry over changes , and as for you , you sha n't ride in it , just for being cheeky . " " Still , I do n't think Gran would like her money to be spent on motor cars . " " Would you like your seat warmed ? " " No . " He edged away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached the garage , they saw Renny standing in the door of the stable . When he saw the new car he turned sharply away and disappeared . At dinner , in the face of his forbidding expression , no one106 FINCH 'S FORTUNE referred to the purchase . Only Wakefield , in every pause , made some pensive remark relating to the likes and dislikes of his grandmother . The day of leaving drew inexorably near . Then it dallied in a spell of heavy rainfall , seeming unreal and far off . Then it rushed upon them , giving them scarcely time for their last preparations . Nicholas and Ernest had taken tea with each of their old friends in turn . Ernest 's cheeks were flushed by excitement . Years seemed to fall from him with every day . The death of Sasha , which in moments of quiet saddened him deeply , made hint feel in the moment of departure singularly free from re- sponsihility . Nicholas , on the contrary , was intensely irri- table . ( ; out ( lanced about his knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last moment , he might have to postpone the trip . He found it hard to tear himself from the four walls of his room , where he could do just as he liked and need pretend to be in no better humor than he was . And , though he would not acknowledge it , he was worried by the pleading look in Nip 's eyes . Toward the last , Finch could do little but play the piano . From morning to night he played . And , when the family would no longer endure it , he went to the Vaughans ' or the rectory and played there . He was up before the sun on the last ( lay . A gale from the west had blown all night , making him wakeful . He rose and leaned out of the window , letting the coolness of the wind refresh him . Daybreak , like a silver sail , was raised in the east , behind the darkness of the wood . To him it seemed the swelling sail of his adventure into a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less lovely on this last morning . He wished that the bird song that seemed to be shaken from the boughs by the wind had been less heart- rendingly sweet , that the silver sail of daybreak had not turned to gold , and then to rose , before his eyes . He would have liked to take away with him a homely , comforting remem- THE DEPARTURE 107brance of the place , not the etherealized , aching beauty of this May morning . The green of the new leaves was too translucentlygreen , the shadows in the ravine slept in too rich a bloom , the mating birds called from tree to tree with too 1 ranced a longing . He dressed in a kind of dream and went out , taking old Benny , the sheep dog , with him . One by one he visited his old haunts . The rustic bridge across the stream , the apple tree in the old orchard , in whose crotch he had spent many hours reading . He went to the inmost part of the wood and lay down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drinking in the smell of the soil . He crushed the young grass in his fingers and smelled it . He cut his initials and the date on a smooth white bole . He wondered what he would experience before he saw this place again . The old dog trotted seriously about investigating , sniffing for a while , then settled clown in a sunny space to doze . The three who were going away took dinner at the Vaughans ' . Meggie could not bear to part with them till teatime . When they returned to Jalna the new car was before the door , the hand luggage already placed in it . Everything was in a rush now . They were annoyed with themselves and Meggie for detaining them so late . Pheasant had on her tweed suit and little brown hat . Mooey , though he was not going , was dressed in his best . Between slices of bread and honey Piers looked at his watch . Alayne was tying up a package of books she had bought for them to read on the voyage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jelly , the last of the russet apples " because Finch loved them so , " and a jar of cough mixture made of rum and honey , which she thought infallible . From first to last the protection of this hamper fell to Finch and was a constant source of worry to him until , on shipboard , he scraped out and ate the last spoonful of the cough mixture , just to get rid of it . How could he throw away anything Meg had given him ! io8 FINCH 'S FORTUNE Renny had not come in to tea . Finch asked , rather anx- iously , where he was . Ernest explained . " He said good- bye to Nicholas and me before we went to Meggie 's . He said he might not be in to tea . " " But he did not tell me good-bye , " stammered Finch . " Surely he would not let me go away without seeing me ? " " Surely not ! " Ernest looked much concerned . " But there is no time for hunting him up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . " " I do n't want any tea ! " Finch set down his cup and rushed out of the house . He had a sense of panic . Punning toward the stables , he saw Wright in the act of backing the old car into the garage . He hesitated and Wright called out , " I f you ' re looking for Mr. Whiteoak , sir , he ' s over at Mrs. I , ehraux 's . " Finch halted . " Wright , what ' s the best time you can make to drive me there and back ? " " I can get you there in five minutes , sir . " Finch clambered into the car . He must see Renny ! The others would just have to wait for him if he was late . There was plenty of time for catching the train . . . . Wright was showing what the old car could do . " You would n't think she had it in her , would you , sir ? " he grinned . A box that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . The door of the car jarred open and the box rolled into the road . " Let it go ! " cried Finch . Wright drove on . " That was a mixture 1 ' d just got from the vet , " he said , ruefully . The place Antoine Lebraux had rented for his venture into fox breeding comprised about twenty acres , a wooden house painted a dingy white , a small stable , a poultry house , and the fragile outbuildings Lebraux had added . Finch had known it as the house of a retired tradesman who had built it ten years before , had spent his days in keeping the premises in THE DEPARTURE 109unnatural order , and had been swift to complain of any intrusionon the part of the boys or dogs from Jalna . Several times Renny had had to pay him for fowls , the deaths of which were laid at their door . Finch had always hated the ugly neatness of the place , hated the rows of white painted stones that lay on either side of the walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance took in the air of neglect that had replaced the smug tidiness . He pressed the electric bell twice without answer . Then he saw , stuck above it askew , a card with the words " Out of order . " He knocked loudly . The minutes flew while he waited for some response , then a step sounded in the passage and a bolt was drawn . Good Lord , was Renny locked in there ? The door opened and Pauline Lebraux stood on the threshold . She looked half frightened at seeing him . She wore a black serge dress of scanty cut , and this , with her long black legs and dense dark hair standing out about her face , made her look strangely fragile and pathetic . On her arm she carried , like an infant , a sickly fox cub wrapped in flannel . Its bright eyes peered out at Finch with an expression abnormally intelligent . Hcr appearance was so singular to Finch that he forgot for a moment what his errand was . " I ' m going away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she only smiled a little and said , " Wo n't you come in ?

He heard himself saying , " I hardly knew you in that dress . You had on white the night you were at our place . " " This is one of my school dresses . I went to a convent in Quebec . " He thought she looked exquisitely remote , half wild , with the fox cub in her arms . He had a sudden desire to touch her , somehow to bring her near him . He said , almost in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was only a child , but he reddened in an odd excitement of the nerves . She shook her head . " No . But you may kiss my hand . " She was being affected , he thought , then remembered her French upbringing . He took the hand she offered , thin and white , with the immature wrist showing below the black sleeve , and raised it to his lips . They repeated " Good-bye , " shyly . He hastened to the back of the house and looked about in the hope of seeing Renny . He saw the foxes in their enclosure , their fur darkly bright in the lowering sun rays . He heard voices in the little stable . How could he go there and call Renny 's name , as though he were a child ? He had a feeling of hot anger against Renny . He had a mind to return to Jalna without seeing him . But he had been seen from within . Renny appeared in the doorway , then came slowly toward him . " Looking for me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d go away without saying goodbye ? " blazed Finch . " Ilow was Ito know what you 'd do ? You do what you like . " Finch was aghast . Was this the way they were going to part ? If it were , it would spoil his trip . If he missed his train , if he missed the boat , he would stay here till he ' d wrung something better than this taciturn coldness from Renny . THE DEPARTURE i i i " What have I done ? Why are you treating me like this ? " " Watch out ! Mrs. Lebraux is in there  --  she ' 11 hear you. , , " I ' m missing my train , do you know that ? Yet you wo n't say a friendly word to me ! God , we might never meet again ! " " I hate saying good-bye . " " But you said good-bye to Uncle Nick and Uncle Ernie . Why not me ? " " That ' s just it . I did n't so much mind saying goodbye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face before him . If that was the truth  --  and Renny was not a liar , and he was frightfully queer about some things  --  oh , perhaps it was not so bad , after all ! Perhaps Renny did n't hate him  --  why , Renny had always kissed him when they parted , like a father ! He looked into Renny 's eyes , his face suddenly contortedin an effort to keep from crying . He put out his hand . Renny took it and drew Finch toward him . He bent and kissed him , in the old way . Finch sniffed the familiar smell of stable on him . A load rolled from his heart . Mrs. Lebraux came out of the stable . She was bareheaded and wore a man 's linen dust coat . She was rather attractive out of doors , Finch thought , with her short hair in its strange stripes of tow color and brown blown back from her face , her blue-eyed boyish stare , and her reckless-looking mouth . She showed him her hands . " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been working with the foxes , and now I ' m learning how to look after horses . " Finch murmured a few hurried words of greeting and farewell , threw a warm glance to Renny , and hastened back to the car . But he was still within earshot when she said in her deep , rather musical voice , with its Maritime Province ac-VITHE VOYAGENICHOLAS and Ernest had arranged that they should sail from New York , returning by way of Quebec . Once , years ago , they had done this and had enjoyed the variety it gave . They would like to repeat the experience , and it would be interesting for Finch . It was necessary that Nicholas should have a cabin to himself . He was so heavy , he said , and could not bear the thought of others in the room with hint . Ernest and Finch , therefore , shared one . The boat sailed at midnight . Finch felt beside himself with excitement . To sail out of the harbor under the quivering brightness of the stars , to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out arms as though to hold the ship , to gaze ahead into the unrolling obscurity of the sea , stirred the very pith of him . Up and up till he was on the highest deck , which he had almost to himself  --  there to lean against the rail , feeling the trembling of her through all his nerves , brought him a new joy unlike anything he had yet experienced . He might have spent the night there had he not remembered that Uncle Ernest would be wanting to turn in . Down below he found that the confusion was lessening , but there were still groups of women in evening cloaks , carrying flowers , surrounded by too prosperous-looking men . Here and there were stewards , fetching vases to hold flowers , running errands . He had trouble in finding his stateroom in the intricacies of the passages . The door of the one next his stood open , and on the floor just inside he saw two flower baskets and several open boxes filled with roses . Two women stood in the passage reading a telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amusing to see you kiss that tall youth . I had n't imagined  --  " That was all he heard . But what had n't she imagined , he wondered . And what had been Renny 's reply ? He would give a good deal to know . And why had Renny gone to the fox farm that afternoon ? Had he spoken the truth when he said that he had been loath to say good-bye ? Or had he just been nursing his resentment against Finch ? Still , this was not the first time he had taken himself off at a critical moment . Finch drew a deep sigh as they bumped along the road . At Jalna he found the others in varying degrees of perturbationat his delay . Ernest was almost in despair , not able to keep still for a moment . Nicholas , solidly settled in the car , was uttering wrathful ejaculations . Pheasant was distraught . Piers said that it was almost more than he could do to keep his hands off him . Wakefield had brought out a pair of binoculars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite hidden from the drive by trees . It was one of the moments when Alayne felt that the Whiteoaks were almost beyond bearing . With a controlled expression she stood holding Mooey in her arms . Mooey was dubiously sucking his thumb , only taking it from his mouth at intervals to say , " I ' m not f'ightened . " They caught the train , and that was all . The porter had barely disposed of their luggage , Piers had barely shaken hands all round , Pheasant kissed all round and exclaimed , " Oh , how I wish I were going too ! " when she and Piers had to get off . They stood on the platform together as the train drew out , their young faces upturned , she blowing a kiss to the three at the window , he bareheaded , a smile , in which there was a shadow of boyish envy of the adventurers , softeninghis face. 114 FINCH 'S FORTUNEtelegrams in their hands . " Telegrams , " he thought . " Troubleat home , poor things ! Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He found his uncle tucked up neatly in the lower berth , his clothes unpacked and hung in the wardrobe ; a little irritated at the lateness of Finch 's coming . " This is what comes , " he remarked , " of traveling with someone your age ! " " But , " returned Finch , peeling off his things , " I do n't think you could have slept if I had been here , there ' s so much noise in the corridors . " " I could have had this glaring light turned out , at any rate . " Finch wasted no time . Soon he was clambering up the little ladder , snuggling on his swaying perch rather like a wild-eyed young cockerel , half timid , half challenging toward the world . he lay there feeling in himself the capacity for absorbing the essence of what surrounded him , not only the beauty or the tragedy , but the mere motion and sound , the thrusting of the ship 's bow against what would restrain her , the foamy onslaughtand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning the sky had clouded and the sea grown rough . Nicholas and Finch were sick men . But Ernest , in spite of his weak digestion , had not enjoyed his meals so well in years . For two days the others lay in their berths while he savored the pleasure of new contacts . While they aged , the years fell from him as he paced the deck or played bridge and sipped cocktails in the lounge . The invincible vein of youthfulness in him was rubbed bright . He strode out with the best of them on the promenade deck . He seemed more like a man of sixty than one of seventy-five . The third day out , when the sky had become a merry blue and the sea was scarcely ruffled , the invalids reappeared , lookingrather sallow and feeling a little resentful of Ernest'sTHE VOYAGE 115state of well-being . Nicholas had the habit of looking clown on him as something of a weakling , while Finch had been obliged to watch his cheery changes of costume from his own perch of suffering , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep by Ernest returning flushed out of his bath , opening and shutting drawers , talking breezily to the steward . Ernest 's wish had been to keep away from their melancholy presence and to make desirable acquaintance among the passengers . It was on the second day that he had discovered Rosamund Trent . It was a moment before he recognized her as the friend with whom Alayne had shared an apartment before her marriage to Eden . He had met her several times on his visit to New York and had admired her . Now he felt delighted at the reencounter at such an auspicious moment . She showed an almost equal pleasure at meeting him . Her mind still brooded with passionate affection on Alayne . She felt pity for her and a kind of envy . Pity because Alayne had buried herself in a place so remote from New York , envy because she would have liked to reach out and grasp the varied experiencesof those who existed outside that city . She had a certaingreed for life . They settled themselves in the prettiest corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rememberedMiss Trent 's fondness for cocktails . She was , he noted , perfectly turned out , from her closely fitting hat to her manicuredhands and her shoes that , one felt , were specially designed for shipboard wear in the month of May . " Now do tell me , " she said , eagerly , " about Alayne ! I was just thrilled by her second marriage . But I ' m so perfectlydevoted to her that I ca n't help worrying the least teeny bit when she does n't write often . I have n't had a letter from her for three weeks . " " Alayne is very well . To my mind she grows more charm-116 FINCH 'S FORTUNEing . She and Renny are so deeply attached . They are really like one being . " Miss Trent smiled happily . " Ah , I ' m perfectly delighted to hear that ! I was so disappointed at not meeting him when he was in New York two years ago . Do you think that Alayne is ever going to invite me to visit her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking questions about the family ( knowing most of them only through Alayne ) as though they were old friends . She was shocked to hear that Renny had ridden at the New York Horse Show the autumn before and had not come to see her . She and Ernest got on famously . She told him that he looked younger every time she saw him , and he told her that she looked handsomer every time he saw her . And , after a couple of cocktails , he and she did indeed look even younger and handsomer still . She had given up the profession of advertising , she told him , and had gone into the antique business with a friend . They had put all their capital into it . They were like two leaves swept along by a tide . They might arrive anywhere or be just swamped . The object of Miss Trent 's trip to England was the purchase of more antiques . " In my waking moments , " she declared , " I think of nothing but antiques . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning toward her across the cocktails . " I am exactly like that about my annotation of Shakespeare . Waking or sleeping , it is seldomout of my head . " Miss Trent 's eyes found the depths of his . " Do you think , " she asked , " that you are going to realize your dream ? " Ernest said that he thought he was . On the morning when Nicholas and Finch came on deck , they found the two stretched side by side in their deck chairs . No other legs on the deck had been swathed so meticulously by the steward as theirs . They exhibited a like fastidiousness . THE VOYAGE I j7There was not a wrinkle in their rugs ; on his lay his binoculars ; on hers the latest available copy of the Connoisseur . Her head was thrown back , her lips parted , showing her fine teeth . She looked young for her fifty-five years . Nicholas , who was leaning on Finch 's arm , halted and stared . Finch stared , too , recognizing Rosamund Trent . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had , in a way , mothered Alayne . Nicholas gave Ernest a poke with his stick and smiled ironicallydown on him . Ernest , a little self-conscious under his brother 's eye , introduced him to Miss Trent . Ernest arranged that they should sit at table together . So Rosamund had the felicity of being surrounded by three distinguished-lookingmen  --  distinguished , at least , by their dissimilarity from the other men aboard . Their contrast to their companion also was marked . The group was the subject of some conjecture . Ilow had they come together ? Rosamund , usually sociable , now became distant , determined to keep her little circle intact . Nicholas took a quite unreasonable dislike to the goodnaturedwoman . He was annoyed at having the isolation that he craved when traveling disturbed by imposed intercourse with her . He was annoyed by the sight of Ernest promenadingthe deck with her , discussing the menu with her . He hated the sight of the food she chose . He resented her knowledge of the affairs of his family , her knowingness concerningantiques . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pieces " brought over by Captain Whiteoak . He decided that she was a fool and told Ernest so . Ernest decided that poor old Nick was only envious of the brisk time he was having . He did not say this to Nicholas , but he did say that Miss Trent was one of the best turned out women on board . " That may be , " returned his brother , " but she ' s not at118 FINCH 'S FORTUNE I THE VOYAGE 119iiall Alayne 's sort . I ca n't see how she ever came to take up with her . There ' s something cheap about her . " Ernest smiled pityingly . " You do n't understand New York life or even modern life . Besides , Miss Trent comes of a good Virginian family . Her people used to keep slaves . " " It appears to me that she keeps one now , " said Nicholas testily . As Miss Trent and Ernest became more preoccupied with each other , Nicholas and Finch held more aloof from them . Finch was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile would stand in the doorway of the saloon watching them ( lance , choosing an imaginary partner among them . One girl with a rather heavy face , but with movements of sustained rhythm , attracted him . Through an entire ( lance he would follow the graceful swaying of her body , mentally pressing it against his own , then turn away and find some isolated spot on the deck where he could watch the ( lark rhythm of the waves . Once he found the saloon deserted when some amusing contest claimed the attention of all , and he sat down at the piano . Ile played the " Prelude in A , " softly , for fear of being heard , betiding over the keyboard as though with his body to muffle the sound . Before he had finished he was conscious that there were others in the room with him . He kept on , but when he had touched the last notes he rose and , assuming the sullen , hangdog expression he often wore at home , hurried out . The girl with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed past . She had been playing the piano through him , as he had danced through her . His Uncle Nicholas complained a good deal to him of his Uncle Ernest . " He ' s acting like a simpleton , " he said . " There ' s nothinghe wo n't do . He and that woman went into some idioticcontest as partners and actually won first prize . I ' ve just been in the lounge seeing them get it . I do n't know what your grandmother would say if she could see him . Upon my word , I should n't be surprised if he ' d end by marrying her , if she were fool enough to have him . " Finch was horrified . The thought of Uncle Ernest as a husband , the husband of Miss Trent , caused his world to rock . He gasped , " Is there nothing we can do to stop it ? Could n't you give him a talking-to ? Could n't you remind him what Gran would think if she knew ? He ' s always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out that she ' d quite approve of Miss Trent . Spirits always say just what you want them to , you know . " " Well , look here , Uncle Nick  --  do you think I might try to cut him out ? " Nicholas looked him over with amusement . " He ' s twenty years older than she is and you ' re about thirty-five years younger . You might have a go at it , though she seems to be out for antiques . " Nicholas was not so much worried over Ernest 's behavior as irritated by it . But Finch was very much worried . On the last night out , a fancy-dress dance was given . Nicholas , after watching the changeful pattern of the dancers for a while , went early to his berth . Finch , lurking outside a window , saw two figures in dominos which , he made sure , were those of Rosamund Trent and Ernest . The thin one in mauve was Ernest . Mauve ! The very tentative blithesomenessof the color sent a stab of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of responsibility for his uncle . How to save him from Miss Trent ! They were undressing in their cabin when Ernest remarked , " Rosamund Trent is a very brilliant woman , Finch . A very vigorous yet very sympathetic woman . " Finch 's head was concealed in his shirt and he left it there , feeling more comfortable thus sequestered , while Ernest went on . " She has rare business acumen , combined with understandingof those of more reflective bent . " Finch thought , " It ' s coming ! God help us ! " And he kept his head inside his shirt . Ernest proceeded , " She never succeeded in her advertising enterprise because it gave no scope for her really ardent tem-perament . " Ardent ! Oh , this was too much ! He struggled out of his shirt and stood in his bare pelt , crimson-faced , glaring at his uncle . Ernest sat down on the side of his berth and fixed his eyes on Finch 's . " But this collecting of antiques is another affair  --  " Antiques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Mean what ? " " That you ' re going  --  " He could not get it out . " What I was going to say is that it seems such a pity to see a woman like Miss Trent handicapped in her new enterprisefor lack of funds . " " Oli , " said Finch , relieved , " is that all ! " " Is n't that enough ? " " Uncle Ernie , I thought you were going to tell me that you were in love with her . " Ernest 's face turned almost as red as Finch 's , but he did not look ill pleased . " I hope I ' ve too much sense to be falling in love at my age , " he said . " And , I if I were going to do anything so foolish , it would be with quite a different sort of woman . A woman more like Alayne , possibly . " Finch felt boundless relief as he hurriedly pulled on his pyjamas . " Miss Trent has put all her capital into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sufficient ready money to invest in antiques to ensure a large profit . She is sadly hampered. 120 FINCH 'S FORTUNE I THE VOYAGE121If she had , say , ten thousand dollars to invest at once , she could , with her skill , double , even treble it . " Finch climbed up to his own berth . He hung over the edge of it looking down on Ernest , feeling somehow that he had saved him from some danger . But it turned out that it was Miss Trent whom he was to save , and , in savingher , make a splendid investment for himself . To the muffled throbbing of the engine they discussed the intricacies of her affairs , with which Ernest was astonishingly familiar , far into the night . VIILONDONTHERE they were , crowded into a taxi , making their way through the traffic of the London streets  --  Finch on one of the drop seats , almost dislocating his neck in the effort to see out of both windows at once . It was too unreal , seeing the places he 11,1d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ! louses of Parliament , Trafalgar Square , the lions , Buckingham Palace ! They thundered at him like a series of explosions . It was too much . It was overwhelming . his uncles simultaneously pointed out places on opposite sides of the street . They were amused and touched by the expression of his face . It was nearly twenty years since they had been in London . They perceived changes even in that hurried drive . Old landmarks gone , new buildings towering in their place . A certain depression tempered the pleasure of the return . They had engaged rooms at the same hotel where once they had been familiar guests . It was no longer a fashionable hotel and had lost something of its air of elegance . But they were delighted to find that the hall porter was the same , scarcely changed except for graying . He recognized Ernest , after a moment of hesitation , but Nicholas only because he was in the company of Ernest . This heavy old man with the drooping shoulders , the sombre face , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very different gentleman from the former Mr. Nicholas Whiteoak . Finch leaned across his window ledge and looked down into the street . Tawny yellow sunlight gave it mystery . The shadows of pedestrians were elongated . A flower seller , LONDON 123with his barrow of spring flowers , had taken his stand below . Three disabled returned men were at the corner playing " Londonderry Air " on two violins and a sort of legless piano held on the knees . A fourth man timidly held out a hat toward the passers-by . From the position of the pianoplayer'shead , Finch guessed that he was blind . He closed his own eyes and listened to the wild , plaintive strain . Beneaththe music he heard the turgid rumble of the city 's life . London . . . . It was too unreal to be here . He could not believe it . He wanted to buy violets from the flower seller , give money to the musicians , do something for the terrible-looking old woman in the feathered hat , shuffling along the opposite side of the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump lady in the flower-boxed window across the way as she paused in her conversation with her parrot to look at him . He must go out again . Ile could not endure the indoors . They had been out all afternoon , had just come back in time for tea , but he must go out again , this time uncleless . They were to be only a week in town before going on to visit Augusta . The fine weather might not hold , so Nicholas and Ernest had decided to go to the Park on that first afternoon . They had sat in the little green chairs watching the riders cantering in the Row . Finch had sat between them , and they , hands clasped on their sticks , had leaned forward to talk across him . Their quiet tones had broken into excited exclamations once when they had recognized a burly , purplefacedrider as an old acquaintance . They had been more or less certain of the identity of half-a-dozen others . A handsomegirl riding a black horse was so like another handsome girl , sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must surely be a daughter . It was most exciting . They had walked through the gardens , shown Finch the Serpentine and the water fowl , the flaming rhododendrons , the rosy foam of the hawthorns in bloom , pointing out this124 FINCH 'S FORTUNE A LONDON 125and that to him with their sticks as though he had been their little boy . But the new apartment houses in Park Lane were horrible to them . Strange , they said , that nothing could have been done to prevent that . They were disgusted with Finch for thinking that Park Lane was still a fine street . To go forth uncleless was now his idea of happiness . He got his hat and went down to the street . Before he could stop himself , he had bought a bunch of violets from the flower seller and so had to set out with these , inadequately wrapped in paper , in his hand . He dropped a sixpence into the hat for the musicians . He stood listening as once more they played " Londonderry Air . " Though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves did not shrink before the discords . Ile was no more affected than a skylark might be affected by the oddities of other singers . But the look in the eyes of these men hurt him deeply . Ile went past densely crowded corners , crossing streets in the jam of evening traffic . He found himself in a little bar in North Audley Street with a whiskey and soda before him . 1 le longed to talk to the barmaid , for he thought she looked interested in him , but had not the courage . He had never been in a bar before. l le strolled along the street looking in the shop windows . One , in which works of art from the East were displayed , held him . He saw a blanc de Chine figure rather like the Kuan Yin that Gran had given him . The little white hands of the goddess were like the half-opened buds of some nightbloominglily . Her tiny feet , set wide apart , were like restingwhite birds . He would have liked to lay his violets at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was astonished to find how high it was . He told the attendant that he had one very much like it at home . He did not say where his home was , but he was aware , as they continued in conversation , that the man knew he was not an Englishman , and he wondered how . Finch told him that he was not going to buy anything , but the man 's interest did not flag . Ile seemed willing just to stand and talk about the various objects admired by Finch . Although he had barely arrived in London , he began to think of what presents he would like to take home to the others . The years that his grandparents had spent in India , the things they had brought from there , had created in their descendants an interest in things Oriental . He would like to take that wicked-looking scimitar to Piers , who had a fancy for old weapons and had been given his grandfather 's long cavalry sword . And for Meggie that embroidered screen . And Wakefield would like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness . Poor young devil  --  he had never been anywhere , seen anything . And , for that matter , where had Piers been , and what had Piers seen ? And here was he , seeing and doing so much ! When he had left the shop , he looked again into the window and saw a picture of a snow-white cockatoo , with a coral-colored crest , and he suddenly remembered Pauline Lebraux and thought he would like to take the picture to her . He saw her clearly for a moment , with her dense dark hair and long black-stockinged legs , standing before the cockatoo , hands clasped in rapt admiration . Either the things he had seen in the shop , the kindness of the man , or the thought of little Pauline  --  he did not consider which  --  gave him a feeling of deep elation as he went on his way down the street . He stopped before the window of an elegant saddler 's to choose the perfect saddle for Renny . He walked on and on . It seemed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few stragglers , he came upon an old man standing bareheaded reciting Shakespeare. 126 FINCH 'S FORTUNEHe had a grand old head , a battered face , and a voice hoarse from declaiming in the foggy air . " Speak of me as I am ; nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice . " As he was ! Finch looked at him , tattered , broken , despair in his eyes . Speak of him as he was ! Oh , who could do it ? Who could bear to think of him as he was ? He stood listening to the voice that was sometimes drowned by the passage of an omnibus , broken by the jeering interruptionsof one of the stragglers . Yet once , Finch was sure , he had been a good actor . He had the artist 's instinct of knowing when he was appreciated . He finished , with his eyes full on Finch . He bowed , with a fine mixture of humility and tragedy , above the half crown dropped into his hat . " Well , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he walked away , " but I ' ve paid more to see poorer acting . " He wandered on , losing all sense of direction . He was in streets of small shops and cinemas , frequented by the working class . They were a slow-moving , respectable-looking lot , with knobbly features , under the electric lights . They were exactly like crowds he had mingled with at home , when he had stayed in town for the night and he and George Fennel had been members of an orchestra . Different from the New York crowd , with its predominance of foreign faces . He had bacon and eggs and coffee in a Lyons shop , sitting at a table next a young couple with the most stunned expression he had ever seen . He wondered what they had done , or were going to do , that they should have that expression . The woman did not eat , but just nibbled the tip of her finger , while the man poked squares of bread into his mouth , where they were consumed apparently without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . LONDON 127The week they were to have spent in London lengthened into two . Nicholas and Ernest renewed old acquaintances and were alternately elated and depressed by the revivification of their past . Finch went with them to dine at the house o f the magenta-faced rider in the Row , who , after some conversation with the boy , came to the conclusion that the Whitcoaks were degenerating . Ernest took Finch to Westminster Abbey , and he stood awestruck , his forelock drooping , above the wreath which the Sultan of Zanzibar had lately laid on the tomb of the UnknownWarrior . Finch went on Sunday morning to Hyde Park and stood among a group of tattered Welsh miners , listening to Socialisticand anti-Socialistic orators . He heard the latter turn the mettlesome force of an obscene vocabulary on an Irish interrupter . He listened to the arguments of a young lady , who looked half frozen in the wind , on behalf of the Catholic League . She spoke well , and he was moved by the sight of the crucifix upright on the ground beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea from a root transplanted . I Icre in England his grandfather , Captain Whiteoak , had been burn . Here his mother , daughterof a London journalist who was always hard up , had been born . Here she had wandered about , distraught , after her father 's death , wondering what to do , before she had decided to go to Canada as a governess . Three quarters of him were English . All but that fourth quarter . That had come like a stormy wind out of the West  --  a fierce gale from Ireland  --  in the person of Grari . VIIINYMET CREWSAUGUSTA had dressed herself with even more care than usual on this afternoon . She arranged with even greater exactitudeher hair , still worn in the fashion of Queen Alexandra , that curled fringe upon which her nephews had so often speculated , going to the length of making bets with each other as to whether it was her own and natural in color , her own and dyed , or a transformation . Not one of them had ever found out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge to themselves . She surveyed herself in the long glass in her bedroom with inward satisfaction , but if an onlooker had been present he would have supposed that her reflection met with her complete disapprobation . She drew in her chin , stiffening the back of her neck , and widened her eyes into an expression of surprisedoffense . But this aspect was as natural to her as one of bold dominance had been to her mother . IIer gaze appeared to be a defense against the object upon which she turned it as old Adeline 's had been one of challenging curiosity . Augusta was little changed since her mother 's death . She had , in truth , improved in appearance . The last visit to Jalna , which had been prolonged to three years , had been something of a strain for her , enduring , as she had , the old lady 's caprices and quips at her expense , and continually expecting that so long delayed death . The lively commotion of the household had also been rather exhausting to a woman herself long past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , where there were none to contradict her without running the risk of losing their situation , andNYMET CREWS 129nothing more exciting than the misbehavior of maids , was a benefit to her health . So , with inward satisfaction and outward disdain , she put the finishing touches to her toilette , noted her still shapely shoulders and the unimpaired arch of her Court nose . I Icr complexion had always been bad , so in that respect she had had nothing to lose . She went the rounds of the rooms prepared for her brothers and nephew , saw that the ewers were full of fresh water , clean towels on the racks , and sniffed the pleasant scent of lavender from the bed linen . She descended to the drawing-room , where the tea table , an hour late in agreement with the arrival of the train , had just been arranged by the parlor maid , Ellen . She had been with Augusta many years , and having made up her mind , on the day after her arrival , that her mistress 's look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scuttling air with which she efficiently per formed all her duties . Augusta , however , thought Ellen was an admirable servant and was constantly singing her praises to friends . She looked doubtfully over the tea table . Would there be enough scones ? Was one square of honey in the comb sufficient ? She remembered Finch 's appetite , how she had always tried to put flesh on him and failed . Well , at any rate there was plenty of bread and butter , and the fruit cake was unusually deep . She went to a window and looked across the spring greennessof the lawn and park to where she could see the road climbingupward from the village . Only one vehicle was in sight , the cart of Jim Johnson , the carrier , returning after one of his two weekly trips to Exhampton . She waited there a few minutes , but she could not be quiet for long ; she was too restlesslyawaiting the arrival . It would be so nice to see them . A week ago she had everything ready to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were remaining another130 FINCH 'S FORTUNEseven days in London . It was so like Nicholas to have sent it at the last minute . He and Ernest had not been to visit her since her husband 's death . On their last visit they had quite tired out Sir Edwin by talking so much , and being so late to meals , and disagreeing with him , as he said to her afterwards , on every subject he brought up . Well , he was safely at rest in the family vault now , and the years had made her brothers more amenable . As for Finch , he was now her favorite nephew . 1 ? deu had been , once , because of his charm , his good manners , his talents , but he was behaving altogether too badly . She loved Renny , but he had inherited several of Mamma 's most regrettable traits . Piers was a splendid young fellow , but sometimes surly and with quite rough manners , caused , she supposed , by association with grooms and laborers . Wakefield was a darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about Finch that made her feel almost maternal . She began to be really annoyed at the lateness of the arrival of her relatives . She sat down by the table , however , and held liersel f together . The firelight  --  an unnecessary extravagance , for the afternoon was still warm  --  played over the folds of her black satin dress and maliciously accentuated a dark mole on her left cheek . A step sounded in the hall and a small spare woman appeared in the doorway . She was Mrs. Thomas Court , Augusta 's cousin by marriage . Her husband had been a son of old Adeline 's youngest brother . She had lived , since her marriage , in Ireland , but had remained in all respects English , as Augusta was inherently English though brought up in Canada . She advanced into the room in a quick jerky walk like a little wound-up figure . Her hair , dragged back from the forehead , vied with Augusta 's in purplish darkness . She had a complexion even more sallow , but she brightened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ornate and old-fashioned , was sprightly . Her features were small , herNYMET CREWS 131light gray eyes intense , and the expression of her thin-lipped mouth one of unyielding conceit . Mingled with these qualitieswas a kind of jaunty good humor . She walked straight to the window , with a side glance at the tea table . Outdoors a shadow had fallen . " Is it raining ? " asked Augusta . " Just beginning to spot , " replied Mrs. Court , her eyes on the paved terrace . " I wish it would rain . The flowers need it . " " I hope it does n't . Dry weather agrees with me much better . It suits my ear . " " How is your ear ? " " Going chug-chug , the same as ever . " Augusta deepened her contralto tones . " Dear me , how very irritating ! " Mrs. Court wheeled and stared at her . " Irritating does n't express it at all  --  it ' s maddening . " She advanced , with a businesslike air and squeaking boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckly forefinger at the plate of scones . " Give me one of those and a cup of tea , and I ' 11 carry them to my room . Relations do n't want outsiderspoking noses into their reunions . " " I have n't rung for the tea yet . And your leaving us is quite unnecessary . " " Very well . " She sat clown on an unyielding chair with buttoned-in upholstery . " But you ' II not be able to make so free with each other . " " There is no need to make free , " said Augusta , rather stiffly . Mrs. Court played a tattoo on the floor with her heels . " It makes me jumpy , " she explained , " to go so long without my tea . " Augusta regarded her with disapproval . " Where is Sarah ? " she asked , in order to take her cousin 's mind off her stomach. 132 FINCH 'S FORTUNEMrs . Court tattooed harder than ever . " Out in the rain . The girl ' s mad . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shining she ' s as likely as not moping in the house . I call her Mole . My pet Mole . " She wagged her head , in recognition of her own wit . " She is a very sweet girl , " said Augusta , " mole or no mole . And I only hope she and Finch will make friends . " " No boy of twenty-one will ever give a second thought to her . She ' s too quiet . Boys like romps . Sometimes I call her Mouse , my pet Mouse . " Augusta was listening to a sound outside . " Here is the car ! " she cried , and hurried to meet them . Mrs. Court squeaked , with even more alacrity , to the bell cord and gave it a tug . " Bring in the tea , " she said to the maid , " and we ' d better have an extra pot . " She stood stock-still then , in the corner , watching the embraces of the family . Augusta turned to her , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Now you must come and speak to my brothers and nephew . Of course you remember Nicholas and Ernest . " They shook hands , recalling how the last time they had met had been in London during the Coronation ceremonies of King George . " Dear Edwin was alive then , " said Augusta . " Thomas was alive , too , " said Mrs. Court , not to be outdone . They settled about the tea table , and Augusta noted how well her brothers looked , but she was a little disappointed in Finch 's appearance . He had the same half-starved look . It was rather hard to reflect that this lanky youth was the possessor of her mother 's fortune , when it would have graced so well Ernest 's courtly presence . Not a large fortune , but how important in a family of such restricted means ! Yet when Finch , sitting close beside her on a chair too low for him , gave her one of his affectionate looks , her heart warmedNYMET CREWS 133towards him and she plied him with buttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A young man . And it seemed only yesterday that he was in his cradle ! Finch , with even greater wonder , stared about the room , with its innumerable ornaments and framed photographs . On the walls hung water colors of Scottish scenery painted by Sir Edwin . On the mantel was a photograph of him lookingout of pale eyes , between thin whiskers . There was a photograph of Wake , in the starry-eyed beauty of five . There was one of Eden and Piers in white sailor suits , with a dog between them . On the piano , a large one of Renny on Landor , the year he had won the King 's Plate . Then there was a pretty one of Meg with Patience . And a still prettier one of Pheasant with Mooey . Everywhere he looked he saw photographs of Whiteoaks . Nicholas , Ernest , and Augusta in their young and middle-aged clays . Gran , as a handsome woman of fifty , in evening dress . And what was that on the small table just beside him ? Himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first day 's shooting , and he held the gun , in the picture , with a terrified look . No wonder he had looked terrified , for the very next week he had tripped with it , when out with Piers , and nearly sent a bullet through Piers 's back ! He had got a licking for his stupidity and the gun had been taken away from him . It was nothing short of an insult to be faced with that picture in the moment of his arrival . " I want you , " he whispered , " to burn that awful picture of me . " " But I like it , dear . It ' s the only one I have of you . " " I 'll have one taken for you while I ' m here . " She gave him more tea , and again he whispered , " I say , where ' s the girl ? " Augusta looked mysterious . " She ' s like you  --  she ' s devoted to Nature . She forgets all about her meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And he helped himself to more134 FINCH 'S FORTUNEhoney . " I hope , " he added , " that she does n't look like her mother . " " Sh . " " But they ' re talking to her , one in each ear . She could n't possibly hear me . " " That is her aunt by marriage . Sarah is an orphan and has been brought up by Mrs. Court . I must tell you about her father later . " A shower was now beating against the panes . As though coming directly out of it , Sarah Court appeared in the doorway and came slowly toward the group about the tea table . What had Finch expected ? An impetuous Irish girl , late for tea because she liked being out in the wet ? A curly-haired sprite , dancing in with rain-dappled cheeks ? A sturdy , matter-of-factyoung person ? Whatever he had vaguely expected , it was certainly not this . She came with a long , slow gait that imparted almost no motion to the upper part of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present generation , moved like the torso of a statue carried on a float . Her dark dress was open at the throat , but buttoned tightly down the front with the effect of an old-fashioned basque , having also the effect of that garment in a short continuation below the waist . Her skirt was too long for fashion , and was arranged at the back in a manner suggestive of a bustle . Her arms were held rigidly at her sides ; her hands had an extraordinary pallor . This pallor was equaled in the profile turned towards Finch . Her black hair was brushed back from her high forehead in glossy smoothness , and worn in a heavy braided coil at the nape . Finch saw that she had the Court nose , but that was not what held his gaze with a sense of something remembered . As she was being greeted by his uncles , who apparently had seen her as a small child in Ireland , his mind flew here and there among his recollections of the past , striving to fix on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her before . It had fastened on nothing when he heard his aunt 's voice introducing them . He still stood staring at her , unable to detach his mind . She came to him , however , holding out her hand . Something in the gesture gave him what he was looking for . Even as they shook hands , he did not see her . His consciousness was occupied in the attic at Jalna . He saw himself in the lumber room on a rainy day crouching by the window absorbed in old copies of Punch taken from a toppling dust-covered pile that year by year increased , for none were ever thrown away . He was looking at the picture of a Victorian drawing-room in which a whiskered gentleman was bowing over the hand of a lady . Other ladies were standing by . They were all alike , and each and all bore a striking resemblance to Sarah Court . That was it ! She was like a drawing by Du Maurier . He was so relieved by the discovery that he smiled delightedlyat her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips parted , showing unexpectedly small , even teeth . He thought he had never seen an upper lip so short , a chin so jutting . Mrs. Court was saying , " Well , Mole ! So you 've come out , now that the sun is gone ! " Sarah Court 's lips closed tightly . She fixed her eyes on a ring with a large green stone which she began nervously to twist on her forefinger . Her aunt leaned forward , as though she would pry under the lowered lids . " Well , Mouse ! Quiet as ever ? " She turned to Ernest . " I call her Mouse , she ' s so silent . It ' s very irritating to me when I ' ve no other companion . " Nicholas said , " Many years ago , there was a girl we called Mouse . She was a ballet dancer . " " Was she quiet ? " asked Mrs. Court , eagerly. 136 FINCH 'S FORTUNE " No , she was rather noisy . But she ' d a peaky little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy a good ballet , " said Mrs. Court , " but I ' ve no pleasure in the Russian ballet . I hate Russian music . It ' s nothing but a fantastic noise compared with Bach , or Handel or Mozart . When Sarah begins to do the rough-and-tumble of it on her fiddle , I get out of the room . It gives me the fidgets . " And she played a tattoo with her heels to show how really fidgety she could become . Iler niece had seated herself and continued to turn the green ring on her finger until Finch carried a cup of tea to her . She helped herself to bread and jam with something of the concentration of a child . Finch was so conscious of her withdrawal , he hesitated to speak to her . However , there was no need for conversation . Mrs. Court only stopped talking long enough to snatch a mouthful of scone or tea , and her harsh yet somehow not disagreeable voice requiredno encouraging response . " Do you keep up your music ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I notice that my hands are getting stiff . " " Ts that rheumatism ? " " I dare say . " " And you ' ve gout , too ? " He grunted . " Now , I wonder if your blood pressure is high ? " " Should n't be surprised . Nothing my body does surprisesme now . " She turned to Finch . " We must get you playing . We ' 11 make a musical time of it . " She talked of music she had heard in the principal capitals of Europe . " But I ca n't afford to travel now , " she said . " I just stick at home in Ireland . Mouse and I make our own music . Do n't we , Mouse ? " How ludicrous , Finch thought , to call that remote-lookingNYMET CREWS 137girl Mouse ! He got up his courage and said , " You play the violin awfully well , I expect . " Her aunt had received no answer to her question and had apparently expected none , for she continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiar smile , with a certain elfish mischief in it , and answered , " You ' 11 know that when you hear me . " It was the first time he had heard her say more than a monosyllable . Her voice , he thought , was the very distillation of sweetness , all the more noticeable following , as it did , the gruff tones of her aunt . And it had a muted sound , as though a secret being within her spoke for her . He tried to draw her into conversation , but he was awkward and she was either shy or aloof . He was glad to escape into the garden when the others went to their rooms . He stood on the drive drinking in the air that was so fresh after London , his eyes opened wide , as though they would take in , at one extravagant glance , the scene that lay unrolled before him . The shower had passed and a light wind was blowing the rain clouds from the upper sky . In the west the sun had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic shapes of which were outlined by his brilliance . But some of this triumphant radiance was reserved for the earth , where fields and trees , wet with rain , showed their own colors intensified to celestial brightness . The house stood on a hill overlooking the village of Nymet Crews , and beyond that , the fields , woods , and pastures that stretched to the edge of Dartmoor . From the village , with its square-towered Norman church and white cottages , there was another rise of land toward the moor , and on this stretch every irregularity of field and meadow was outlined by the flowering hedgerows . The pattern of it was unrolled before him like a rich tapestry . The deep red earth of one field lay beside the pale red of another ; the tender green of pasture13g FINCH 'S FORTUNEagainst the silver green oats ; the darkness of a spinney next a field of corn that held the sun . He could see panes , between tall hedges , threading their way to the open moor , there to be lost . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tors . The air held an almost palpable sweetness , unknown to him , of garden flowers , of new-mown grass , of the thousand wild flowers of the countryside and hedge , of Dartmoor itself . Lyming t tall was an unpretentious house of no particular period , hut its gardens , lawns , and park were kept in excellent order . Augusta was proud of the commanding view over the countryside . The fact that there were no large landowners about , and few people of wealth , gave her a pleasant feeling of superiority . Finch wandered among the flower beds , discovered the tennis court , the rosary , and walked down the drive which sloped steeply to the gate . There was a small , gabled lodge half hidden in roses , so much like a picture of a little English house that Finch had to grin with delight as he looked at it . He turned away when he saw a woman in the door and cut across a corner of the park to where he could see the stable . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given its evening meal by a boy a couple of years younger than himself . He put his knuckle against his forehead when he saw Finch . He had sombre black eyes and a rich tan on his cheeks . " Good evening , " said Finch . " I came in to see the horses . " " There ' s only this one , zur , " answered the boy . " Her ladyship just keeps him for the lawn mower and garden work . l 1 er has n't kept more than this un since I ' ve worked ' ere . His name ' s Bobby . " Finch patted Bobby 's fat flank . " I suppose he ' s all she needs . But are n't there any dogs about ? " NYMET CREWS 139 " No , zur . We had one , but he was took bad one day and died . " " Have you worked here long ? " " Two years , zur . I help Ash , the gardener . " What a nice-looking boy he was , Finch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d like a dog about . " " Yes , zur . " Finch wished he would n't call him " sir " quite so often . It made him feel silly . The men about the stables at homedid not treat him with great respect . He scarcely seemed grown up to them . " An old English sheep dog is a nice dog , " he remarked . " We have one at home . " " Yes , zur . An old English is a very nice kind of dog . " " And Irish terriers are first-rate companions . We have one of them , too . " " Yes , zur . An Irish terrier is a nice kind of dog to have . " Finch remembered Nip . " My uncle has a Yorkshire terrier . Clever little fellow , too . " " Yes , zur . A Yorkshire terrier is a very nice kind of dog . " His dark eyes looked earnestly into Finch 's . He seemedsatisfied that he was carrying on an animated conversation . " There are spaniels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , zur . A spannel is a nice kind of dog . " Finch looked at him excitedly , trying to bridge the gulfthat separated them . " My brother has two clumber spaniels , " he said . " Yes , zur . Two Glummer spannels must be very nice to have . " They smiled at each other . Finch turned to go . Then hestopped . " I say , what kind of dog was the dog you had here ? " " He was a spannel , zur . " " Oh . . . . Was he a good ( log ? " " Yes , he was a spannel , zur . " , 140 FINCH 'S FORTUNE " Well , I think I ' 11 be off . What ' s your name ? " " Ralph Hart , zur . " Finch repeated the name to himself as he prowled among the shrubbery , thinking how well it suited the dark interestinglookingboy . But what a conversation ! He would like to go back and do it all over again and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d wager it would . He found the kitchen garden  --  strawberries under netting , and gooseberries like eggs . He came upon a door in a wall , almost hidden in ivy , and pushed it open . He found himself in a walled flower garden . I le went up and down the box-bordered paths , a lanky figure filled with the joy of being alive in that warm , sweet-scented enclosure . He squatted to look into Canterbury bells . He held moss roses in his hand . He put his long nose to the very earth to smell the mignonette . The pear trees , trained against the wall , were beautiful to him . At that moment the orchard of pear trees at Jalna , which carelessly covered the ground with golden fruit every fall , seemed a poor thing . He could not decide which roses were the most beautiful , the newly opened ones , their inner petals still resisting the fingers of the sun , or those at that mysterious moment of perfection just before they fade and fall , when they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete as to have something of delicate vehemence in it . He thought he would like to carry his breakfast to this garden one morning , and eat it with no one about but the birds and Ralph Mart . When Ellen showed him his room he was glad to find that its windows overlooked the walled garden . There was a can of hot water , and his clothes were laid out ready for him on the bed . He felt very happy . He had had no idea it would be so nice at Aunt Augusta 's . He wished that Mrs. Court and her niece were not there , so that they might be just a family party . . . . Still , after all , Sarah Court was his cousin . But how strange and unapproachable she was ! AndNYMET CREWS 141she had a baffling charm for him . As he stood looking out of the window his thoughts , like curious birds , hovered about her . He was still looking down into the garden , where a violaceousshadow had tempered all the brightness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice asked , " Are you dressed , dear ? May I come in ? " He threw open the door and stood guiltily before her . " I say , Aunt , I ' m awfully sorry ! I have n't begun to dress . I ' ve just been staring into the garden . You should n't have given me a room with a window overlooking it . " She sailed with kindly majesty into the room . " I am glad you enjoy your view . It is not as pretty a room as I should have liked for you . But you see how it was . There were four others to be considered before you . " " Look here , " cried Finch , with a violent wave of the arm , " I ' d rather have this garden tinder my window than a Turkish rug and a Louis Seize bed and a Turner landscape in the room ! " " I am so glad you like it , " said Augusta , but she spoke abstractedly . She went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settee at the foot of the bed . She had on a black dinner dress and wore her old-fashioned jewelry that was beginning to be fashionable again . She raised her large eyes to Finch 's face and said , in a tone almost tragic , " Finch , I am in great trouble . " Her voice sounded a barytone depth . The thought of anyone 's being in trouble terrified him . He was used to trouble , Heaven knew , but his hair seemed to rise at the mere mention of it . " Oh  --  what ' s up , Aunt ? " " Eden , " she boomed , " is sitting on the doorstep . " He had an instant mental picture of Eden , rather down-atheelbut debonair , with that insolent , veiled smile of his , loungingon the doorsill . He could only make incoherent sounds expressing a state of being staggered . " That girl , " proceeded Augusta , " is with him . " 142 FINCH 'S FORTUNESo Eden and Minny were both sitting on the doorstep ! He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his look of consternation was sufficient to satisfy his aunt of his sympathy . " They are , " she said , " living in the lodge . " The lodge ! And he had walked down to it not an hour before ! Perhaps the woman he had seen in the doorway was Minny . " But how did they get there ? " he asked " lly effrontery . As they get everywhere . You know I am attached to Men . I can not help being attached to Eden . But to have him come and sit on my doorstep , when I have Mrs. Court and Sarah in the house , is too much . " " But how did they come there ? And when ? " Life seemed one long surprise for him . Now he asked himself , as he had asked himself about so many things , can this be true ? Augusta said , " They have been there a week . Eden turned up a month ago alone . She was somewhere in the offing , awaiting her chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was completely out of funds and he asked me if he might not come and live at the lodge . I told him that the widow of the lodge keeper lived there alone . She paid me no rent , but he had been very faithful , and after his death I let her live on there . She often came and helped about the house . Now what do you suppose Eden 's remark was after I had told him all this ? His remark was , Ca n't you turn the widow out ? ' Did you ever hear of anything more cold-blooded ? " " It was terrible , " agreed Finch . " It was barbarous  --  not only the words , but the way he uttered them . Just a casual Ca n't you turn the widow out ? ' As though it were the turning of a hen out of a coop . I spoke impressively to him . I said , Eden , I never thought I should live to see the day that a Whiteoak and a Court should suggest that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CREWS 143may have been , we have been benevolent . ' " She pressed her middle finger where her eyebrows all but met . " What did he say to that ? " " He said nothing . He just gave that rather tired smile of his and began to talk about his poetry . He does write really beautiful poetry , you know . " " And what then ? " " After he ' d had tea , he went away . What was my astonishment , in less than a fortnight , when the widow 's daughter , who lives in Plymouth , wrote to her mother asking her to come to Plymouth to live . She is going to have another child , and takes in lodgers , so it was altogether too much for her . " " And did the widow go ? " " She went . And she had only been gone two days when Eden sauntered into the garden , where I was cutting roses , and said , Well , we ' ve settled in . ' Settled in ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Me and Minny , ' he said . Just like that , without grammar or consideration . Then he said , We heard the widow had got out , so we 've moved in . ' I shouted , You ' ve moved into the lodge ! You ? ' And he said , Yes , Minny and me . ' And there they ' ve remained . " " What are you going to do about it ? " " I do n't know , I ' m sure . I thought perhaps you could help me . I ' m afraid that i f I tell your uncles they may be too severe with him . He was such a sweet boy . Clever , like you  --  only so much more  --  " She hesitated . " Yes , I know , " said Finch . " I should n't mind in the least their occupying the lodge for a time , if only they were married , though Minny does look very odd since she ' s taken to painting her ears . " " Painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dab of paint on the lobe of each ear . I suppose it ' s living in France . " " Well , well , " said Finch again . He felt as though life144 FINCH 'S FORTUNE NYMET CREWS 145were really crowding too furiously on him . He asked , " Do the people about here know that they are not married ? " " No one knows but Mrs. Court . We have , so far , kept the fact of their existence from Sarah . Her aunt is very particular about Sarah 's acquaintances . " " She is rather a strange girl , Aunt Augusta . " " You will not think her so strange when you are used to her . . . . " But her strangeness was even more pronounced at dinner . When she spoke to him , asking him a question or two about his home , he could only feel a sensuous pleasure in the beauty of her voice . 1 ler words , he was sure , revealed nothing of her . She seemed scarcely conscious that she uttered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face . He could study as often as he chose that pale profile , with the drooping , sensitive mouth encamped between the conspicuous nose and chin . 1-Ie noticed how the candlelight lay on her breast and touched her arms as though it loved her. l-le heard Mrs. Court 's voice across the table , as she talked with gusto to Uncle Nicholas . " Fred thought he would be better off i f he took the other church as well . But it just meant that he had to get a curate , and what with the curate , and the glebe lands being worth so much less , I think he ' s worse off . Ile rents his fields for half what he used to and his hearing grows worse every year . " Finch longed to hear his cousin play the violin , but he could not make up his mind to ask her . However , the evening was not far advanced when Augusta said to Mrs. Court , " I am hoping that you and Sarah will play for us . My brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some music . Would n't you , Ernest and Nicholas ? " They would , and said they would , both addressing Mrs. Court , as though she were to be the sole performer . She gotup at once , in a businesslike manner , and hurried , with her effect of being wound up , to the piano . " Come , Sarah , " she commanded , " and get out your fiddle . " Her niece rose impassively and followed her . On a window seat near the piano lay her violin case . She took out the instrument and began to tune it . Mrs. Court had seated herself and removed several bangle bracelets . Finch did not know what he expected , but his curiosity had in it the quality of pain . There was a subtle sense of distress in the thought of these two women , so antagonistic in spirit , as he was sure they were , attempting to produce the exaltation or gayety of music . He could not tell which he despaired of most  --  the self-assured little marionette at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin . . . . That chin of hers . God , she seemed fairly to dig it into the violin ! He glanced nervously at his aunt and uncles to see if misgiving might be evident in their faces , hut there was none . Augusta sat upright , wearing an expression of almost overwhelming benevolence . Nicholas was frankly sprawling in the deep chair he had chosen , his handsome hands dangling over its padded arms . Yet , in spite of his attitude of indolence , he was very much alive . A vivid interest was bright in his deep-set eyes . Ernest looked suddenly wan and tired . They played one of Handel 's sonatas . The slow , gracious music rose from the violin and piano in harmonious accord . Aunt and niece were not only skilled performers , but they were in complete understanding . Yet Finch 's sense of pain did not diminish , but rather increased . On Mrs. Court 's side he felt too much cold energy ; on his cousin 's , a too docile perfection . Mrs. Court was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dragging her by the hair of the head through the starry realms of sound . As they went from one piece to another ( Mrs. Court never seemed to tire ) , Finch became convinced that Sarah could146 FINCH 'S FORTUNEplay the violin very differently if she had a different accompanist . Now the door of her senses was shut fast . She was only going through certain tricks she had been taught . If only the door were opened and her spirit set free to rejoice and to suffer in the music of her violin ! He had a scarcelycontrollable longing to lift Mrs. Court bodily from the piano seat and himself take her place . He pictured himself ascutting Sarah 's bonds , and the two of them free , soaring together . But it grew late , and he was not even asked to play . IXA DEVON DAYMORNINGFINCH was awakened the next morning by the sound of a man 's voice shouting orders to a dog , by the dog 's barking , in his turn , orders to a flock of sheep , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gust of wind blowing in at the window and flinging on his face the gathered sweetness of the garden and the fields . His eyes flew open and he saw the bright chintz of the bed curtains , the wallpaper with its prim birds pecking prim cherries , the white mantelpiece with the china figure of a little lady riding a pink horse , and two framed photographs so dim that he could not tell what they represented . He was in Devon , he realized , in the very depths of its deep , rich , luxuriant roundness that lay on the earth like a nest on a bough . He was in Devon . He was in England . He must make himself believe it , though it seemed impossible to believe . Here he was , Finch Whiteoak , in the middle of one of Aunt Augusta 's beds , in the middle of one of her bedrooms , in the middle of Lyming Hall , in the heart of Devon . He had traveledby train the six hundred miles from Jalna to the New York pier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped a fortnight in London . He had traveled the nearly two hundred miles into Devon . And he had not only done that , but he had brought his two old uncles with him , paid all their expenses out of his own money that Gran had left him , and had set them down safe and sound beside Aunt Augusta . He lay still , feeling flabbergasted at his own achievement . He wondered if other fellows felt so surprised at the happenings of their lives . There was Piers  --  he had got married , got148 FINCH 'S FORTUNEa kid , gone through a good deal , yet he never seemed surprised . He might look in a rage at things , but not surprised . George Fennel never seemed surprised , nor Arthur Leigh . Still , he supposed , they kept it to themselves if they were . Just finding himself alive was often a rather frightening surprise to him . FIe wondered when he would outgrow it and rather hoped he would not , for there was something he liked in it . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was framed in a climbing rose with little tight yellow roses clinging there as thick as bees on a honeycomb . Down in the garden , where sunlight and shadow had the sharp distinctness of early morning , he saw Ralph Hart trimming a box border . I le wore corduroys and leggings and his black head was glossy in the stuff . The stone wall had a peculiar golden bloom on it except where there were patches of grayish lichen . Ivy lay thick along its top , and clumps of yellow stonecrop . The fields beyond the wall were let to a farmer . Finch saw him now , astride of a stout brown cob , wearing a clean linen Norfolk jacket and breeches , a pink wild rose in his buttonhole. 1Ic was so short and stout that his legs stuck out on either side of the horse . Beneath his hat , set at a jaunty angle , showed his round earnest face , red as a peony . In gruff hearty tones he gave directions to two men who were trying to keep several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herd through the open gate into the next field . The men ran here and there waving their arms , the bullocks blundered , with unexpected agility , among the buttercups , the dog barked , half beside himself with importance , and the sheep , uttering the same cry in a variety of tones , bundled themselves here and there , but always managed to evade the gate . It was a vivacious scene , of which all the participants , from farmer to buttercups , looked shining , wellnourished , and in good humor . " Devonshire cream , " murmured Finch , lolling on the sill . A DEVON DAY 149 " Devonshire cream  --  that just expresses it . Gosh , if only the others were here to see this ! " One of the others was , he remembered  --  just down the drive at the lodge . If he walked down that way now he might get a sight of him , before Minny was about , for Eden loved the early morning . He had not seen him for more than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all that time in Europe . Would he be changed , he wondered . Rather embarrassing to meet Minny under the conditions . Hot stuff , Minny  --  no doubt about that . He slid into his clothes and went downstairs . No one was about but Ellen , industriously ( lusting . The door stood open and warm sunlight had already taken the chill from the hall . The gardener was mowing the terraced lawn . Finch stood for a moment to watch the little white heads of the daisies leap from their stems and fall like spray before the knives of the mowing machine . Ile went to the gardener and spoke to him , just for the pleasure of hearing the singsong of his Devon accent . He was a thin , youngish man with very blue eyes , a fair skin , and not a tooth in his head . He stopped the pony and let his eyes wander over the sweep of fields , woods , and mist-wreathed tors that Finch had admired . " Ay , it ' s a lovely voo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voo in all seasons . But ' tidden quite so pretty now as ' t were an hour agone when that highest tor had just put un 's head out o ' mist . " " What is the name of that tor ? " asked Finch , to draw him out . " Ah , " his eyes moved slowly to Finch 's face , " I could n't tell ' ee that . He ' s got a name . They ' m all named , but I ' ve never seen un close by , and I ' ve never heerd tell . " Finch stared . " Have you never been on the moor , then ? " " No , zur . My work has always been about here . Us sticks pretty close to own parts hereabouts . " A heavy cart drawn by three horses harnessed head to tail , 150 FINCH 'S FORTUNE and carrying a forest tree , rumbled along the road below . The gardener watched it till it was out of sight , then he said , " Him ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m cuttin ' down a fine lot there . Six souls are hard at it , day in , day out . Cuttin ' trees . " Finch felt that if he stayed longer talking to the gardener he would not have the strength to walk to the lodge . That rich , singsong voice , those meditative eyes , produced in him an exquisite weakness . Soon he would have to lie down among the daisy heads . . . . The whir of the mower began again as he went down the drive . The rumble of the cart faded in the distance . The gray trunks of the beeches on either side of him were dappled with sunshine , and here and there along the hedge a tall foxglove shook out its bells . The ground fell away so abruptly that he looked down on the lodge . Someone was astir within , for a blue spiral of smoke rose from the chimney . He followed the curve of the drive to the gates and stood looking timidly at the house . He felt very shy of meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flagged walk , between borders of petunias and pinks , and peer in at the window . He saw a table inside set for a simple breakfast , the sunlight falling on a half loaf of bread and a glass pot of raspberry jam . He saw a small room with beamed ceiling and a large fireplace . A figure he recognized as Eden was bent over some- thing in a frying pan . He was almost inside the fireplace . Finch entered without knocking , his canvas shoes making no sound on the stone floor . He went and stood almost behind Eden . The room was filled with the smell of frying bacon . A pot in which tea was brewing stood on the warm hearth . Eden wore loose gray flannel trousers and a shirt open at the throat , with rolled-up sleeves . Finch could see the gleam of short golden hairs on his rounded forearms . His face looked full and healthy , but retained a certain deli- A DEVON DAY z 5 tcate sensitiveness of expression that prevented its acquiring an aspect of well-being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke , and the inherent melancholy of his mouth was perhaps accentuated by the cigarette that drooped from its corner . His hair was , as always , well brushed , with the gleam of a metal casque . Finch had time to take in these details , overemphasized by the glow of the fire , before he was discovered . Eden with difficulty kept himself from overturning the bacon . " Well , I ' 11 be damned , " he exclaimed , " if it is n't Brother Finch ! So you ' ve come to breakfast with me ! " He stood smiling at Finch . The frying pan tilted in his left hand , he extended the right . " Oh , no , " protested Finch , shaking hands limply . " I really must n't ! Aunt Augusta will be expecting me . I should n't have come in on you like this , so early  --  I think I ' d better not stay . " He felt flustered under Eden 's eyes . " Sit down , " said Eden , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in the nick of time . I ' m getting my own breakfast , as you see . We ' 11 start on what bacon I ' ve cooked and I ' 11 put on some more to fry while we eat . " He carefully divided the bacon and made his other preparationsin a businesslike manner . Finch cut thick slices of the sweet crusty bread , and felt ferocious hunger rage within him . He saw that Eden had dumped all the bacon from the paper packet into the pan and he thought , " Lord , he has n't forgotten what a pig I am ! " So they sat facing each other across the breakfast table , another marvelous happening to Finch . He watched a bee drift in through the open diamond-paned casement and settle on the rim of the jam pot . Ile said :  --  " I say , Eden , is n't it funny that you and I should be eating breakfast here together ? To think that we ' d both cross the ocean and you ' d go to France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to England and we ' d sit down at a breakfast152 FINCH 'S FORTUNEtable here in this lodge , just like we 've had breakfast together many a time at home ! " He took a large mouthful of bread and his young face was so thin that it made his cheek jut out ridiculously . His eyes were bright with excitement . " I do n't see anything funny in it , except you , " said Eden . " Certainly you are Finch , wherever you go . " " Do n't you think I ' ve changed ? " Shyly he hoped that Eden would say that he had improved in appearance . Eden had never seen him in such good clothes as he wore this morning . F.d ( n looked him over critically . " No , you ' ve not changed , except for a better haircut and a few glad rags . You ' re the same callow youth . But , " he added quickly , as he saw Finch 's face fall , " believe me , you ' re the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see why you must pull my leg the moment we meet . " " I ' m not pulling your leg . And I do n't know exactly why I say it . I t ' s not because of your music . Perhaps it ' s because it seems to me that you have the faults and virtues of the rest of us sublimated in you . You ' re more of the coward , more of the hero , more of the genius , more of the poet  --  " " The poet ! " " Oh , I do n't suppose you 'll ever get it down on paper . And , unless I miss my guess , more of the lover  --  when your time comes . " Finch drowned his embarrassment in a cup of blazing hot tea . Yet he liked to hear himself described , especially in such extraordinary terms as these . " You ' re the peculiar flower of our peculiar flock , " continuedEden . " It looks to me as though our forebears had rampaged down the centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final flourish . Their justification , perhaps . " There was no doubt about it now  --  Eden was talking toA DEVON DAY 153hear himself talk . Finch glared at him . " What about you ? " he demanded . Eden smiled faintly . " Well , perhaps me , too . Let ' s hope so . " " We ' re not half the men Renny and Piers are ! " burst out Finch . " No ? Well , I do n't suppose we 'll produce so many young . Breed so many foals . Jump so many hurdles . " " I ' d a thousand times sooner be like them ! " " Of course you would . And they 'd a thousand times sooner be like themselves . The world might have reached a state of civilization ages ago if that were n't always the case . People without imagination are always cocksure , and they 've been given the power of intimidating and exhausting those who have . The man with imagination is frightened at what he sees in himself . The thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eden emptied the remainder of the milk from the jug into his teacup and drank it . " Ever since I had that beastly lung trouble , " he said , " I drink whatever milk comes my way . " Finch had finished the bacon . He remembered Minny . " Why , look here , " he cried , " what ' s Minny going to have ? " " She eats scarcely any breakfast . She ' s getting fat , poor soul ! " " I hope she ' s well , " said Finch , timidly . " Absolutely fit . Sleeps like a log  --  sings like an angel , . and talks like a fool , " answered Eden , turning the loaf crumb . side down to keep it fresh for her . " Let ' s go for a walk , and not waste the best time of the morning indoors . I'il show you my favorite nook . Only mind you keep out of it unless I ' m with you . " They went through the gate into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slouching ; Eden movingwith the grace that made people turn to look at him. 154 FINCH 'S FORTUNEThe road curved frequently so that they seldom saw more than a short distance ahead of them , and the height of the hedges combined to produce in them the feeling that they were traversing one of the very veins of Summer through which flowed the energy that produced her efflorescence . They met no soul on the road after they had passed a man sitting sideways on a white horse , with a basket on the crook of his arm . The tangle of holly and ivy in the hedges glittered as though varnished and , against this background a thousand spring and early summer flowers were fluttering their bright petals . fink and waxen-white hedge roses , the cuckoo flower , bird's-eye , the bee-shaken bells of the foxglove , and , clustering beneath them , the tender spears of ferns . The road was a changeful , dusky red , paling on the rise of a hill , darkening on its fall . Above it the sky changed without rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one moment the impression of tranquil nearness , at the next the aching pallor of unbounded space . A flock of starlings cast a shadow on the road , and the beat of their wings as they passed was like the break of a summer wave . They had to stand close to the hedge to let a herd of red Devon cows go by . The sweet warm smell of newly milked udders came from them and their humid eyes turned in indolent curiosity toward the brothers . Eden opened a gate into a meadow across which a footpath wavered among buttercups and clover . In a boggy corner rose the yellow spears of the iris and a great oak tree made a shade already sought by sheep pink from the dipping . They followed the path through a spinney where some young rabbits at play paused , staring and startled for a space , before scampering to cover . They crossed a stream by steppingstones , and then the path joined a lane so narrow that the trees , almost meeting overhead , turned it into a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensified into an unreal and dreamy brilliance . A DEVON DAY 155They talked little as they went , Eden pointing out this and that in broken sentences . But when they reached a certain gap in the hedge he said , " Here we are ! This is my own particular spot . You see I must rather like you or I should n't have brought you here . " They passed into a grassy dell that lay at the foot of a series of fields of barley , oats , and wheat that rose , fold upon golden fold , to the rounded hills on which the bosoms of the clouds seemed to rest . They stretched themselves upon the grass and it was as though they lay at the foot of the rich tapestry of June , unrolled on the hillsides above them . Here were the last of the bluebells , their tender stems bending beneath the weight of their blossoms that seemed the very distillation of nature 's thought of blueness . Finch lay with eyes on a level with them , as still , as empty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instant , their beauty pour into him . As with a catch in the breath of his being , he was suspended , knowing nothing , feeling all , as he fancied . " I can not help thinking , " Eden said , " of the ecstasy that bluebell must feel in its color  --  how it must push out each fibre into the soil to get more pigment for it  --  how it must hold up its leaves like hands to catch the sun rays , and , before it flowers , how it holds up its pale green bud like a mouth towards the rain . And all of this with just one idea  --  color ! " " And yet , after all those thoughts , " said Finch , " you have picked it ! " " That is my way of reaching out to get color for myself . " " Eden , you ' re a queer sort of fellow . " " Yet I should n't be surprised i f I have more pure thoughts in the twenty-four hours than some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just what do you mean by pure thoughts ? " Eden rolled on to his back and let the sun shine on his face . " I mean thoughts of men and women as happy natural beings , 156 FINCH 'S FORTUNEmaking the most of every hour of their short stay here , like these flowers do or those birds overhead  --  satisfied that there shall be any number of varieties of their kind , not trying to force themselves to one dun color or one self-righteous squeak . " Finch grunted acquiescence . " That ' s just the way I feel , " he said . " Only I think you ' re wrong when you say that Renny has no imagination . I think he has lots of imagination . Only lie 's like a spirited horse , and I think his imaginingsrather startle him . " " 1 ) o you really ? That ' s interesting . . . . By the way , how do he and Alayne get on ? " Finch wished that Eden had n't asked that question . DiscussingAlayne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on very well , " he answered , hesitatingly ; " that is , as far as I can tell . " " I ca n't imagine their getting on . No Whiteoak that ever lived could satisfy Alayne 's ideal of what a husband should be . All those cold-blooded New England ancestors  --  with a few stolid Dutchmen thrown in  --  are too much alive in her to make it possible for her to understand us . " Finch felt suddenly frightened for Alayne . " But Renny ' s not a bit like you ! " Yes , he is ! Only where I am weak , he is strong , and where I am strong , he ' s as weak as water . " " I ' ve never seen any signs of weakness in Renny ! " " Have you seen any signs of strength in me ? " Finch laughed , but did not answer . Eden went on , " Well , when you begin to look for the one , you ' II perhaps stumble on the other . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see enough of him . I think she often feels hurt because he spends so much time with his horses . " It was easier to discuss them with Eden than he had thought . A DEVON DAY 157Eden laughed . " She may thank her stars that he does . Let them remain distant acquaintances and passionate lovers , and they may get on . Renny could n't be a companion to a woman of Alayne 's sort . She ' s too exquisitely precise . She ' s a very sweet-pea-ish kind of woman . " " I think that ' s rather good , " said Finch . " There ' s something delicate and alert and fragrant about her . Rather like the sweet peas , though I know you do n't intend it as a compliment . " " A woman should n't be like any particular flower . It grows monotonous . She should be like a whole garden of flowers  --  indefinite , restful , drugging the senses , not stimulatingthem to irritation . " " Is that what Minny is like ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a vegetable garden . Nourishing , wholesome , a kind of roughage for the soul . " " She sings beautifully . " " Does n't she ! I sometimes think , when she is singing to me in the evening , that i f only she would pass away as she sings , I could adore the memory of her forever ! Finch considered this remark in silence . He could not follow the swift , erratic changes of Eden 's mind , the mystery of his relations with women . He felt pity for any women who loved Eden . . . . Pity , too , for a woman who loved Renny . . . . And was not there something in young Pheasantto stir one 's compassion ? Perhaps , then , it amounted to this  --  that any woman who gave herself in love was to be pitied . What , then , of the woman who would perhaps one day love him ? Would she move another heart to pity ? He lay in the increasing warmth of the sun , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . At that momentit had to him the impenetrability of a forest , above which leaned the perfumed globes of the bluebells . His lips parted158 FINCH 'S FORTUNEand he drew the sweet air into his mouth . . . . A long sigh came from Eden . Was it of content or longing ? The face of his cousin , Sarah Court , rose in Finch 's mind , transfixed there as though in a trance . Dreamily he examined it , feature by feature  --  the high white forehead under the drawn-back hair ; the eyes that repelled all warmth yet held the light of some inner fire ; the high-bridged , narrow-nostriled nose ; the mouth , small , secret , withdrawn between that nose and jutting chin ; the full white throat , developed like that of a singer. l lolly he wished that he were alone , that he might meditate on that face , its potentialities , in this solitude . He turned his back on laden and lay face downward , pressing against the tender growth of grass and flowers . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to him intermittently for years . A form , mistlike , opaque , yet the shape of himself , drew out from his breast , and when its entire pale length had emerged , and it had sprung free of him , it floated near him , leaving him empty as a sighing shell , but with a strange feeling of power , as if he were at that moment capable of doing unimagined things . As it left his breast it drew all sense of the I away from him , and , at the same time , all weakness . The impersonal being that was left held an undirected , elemental strength . The strange feeling of power was there , but with no desire to exercise it . The sensation passed like breath from a mirror , leaving him the reflection of his normal self . He found his mind still dwelling on the thought of Sarah Court . In a muffled voice he asked Eden if he had ever seen her. laden answered drowsily that he had . Flail he spoken to her ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcast . Had he really seen her face ? Yes . What did he think of her ? A DEVON DAY 159Eden sat up , clasping his ankles . " Think of her ? Why , I think that by the time she ' s fifty her nose and chin will meet . " Finch remembered how the lamplight had glimmered on the point of her chin , turning it to porcelain , as she stood beside the piano . He remembered how she had held the violin a prisoner with it , seemed to dig it into the very wood of the violin . He said , huskily , " She ' d be a funny sort of girl to kiss , would n't she ? " " God , you ' d never be able to tear yourself away from her ! " " There ' s something very beautiful about her , too . " He turned over and faced Eden , half-shamefacedly . " Is there ? " A troubled look came into Eden 's eyes . " I wish I might meet her . I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s always going off alone . Minny ca n't bear the sight of her , yet she 's always routing me out of my chair to see her go by . She cries , in a stage whisper , For heaven 's sake , come . That old-fashioned creature is mincing past . What a dead-and-alive profile ! What skirts ! ' And we peep between the curtains . " " If only you two were married , we might have some good times together . There ' s a tennis court that could be made into quite a decent one . " Eden gave a grimace that made his handsome face grotesque . " No ! I tried it once  --  it does n't suit me . Talk of prostituting one 's art  --  better that than smothering it in the marriage bed . . . . I was only twenty-three when I married Alayne . Perhaps when I ' m thirty-five I ' 11 try it again . No man should marry before that . . . . Do n't you do it , young Finch ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very worrying to Aunt Augusta . Here you are , one might say , on her doorstep  --  " Her very expression ! " shouted Eden . " You ' ve been talking me over . "
