APROPOS OF ASSES A STORY BY LOWRY CHARLES WIMBERLY W ADHAM was an ass . It did Higgins good on this cold December night to call Wadham just that . There was a time , though , when Higgins had thought to help the word along with adjectives . An utter ass . Wadham was that . Or a consummate ass . Wadham was that , too . An unmitigated ass or an ass incomparable . Any one of these was good . But as a matter of fact the word did n't need bolstering up with adjectives . It was a strong word and could stand alone . Only three letters . Rather only two , to be exact . And Higgins liked to be coldly exact where Wadham , with his blathering hot air , was concerned . An ass , then . Simply that . The trouble was that he had never been able to bring himself to call Wadham that to his face . To tell the truth , he had never called Wadham that where anyone could hear him . For countless evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listened to Wadham talk And each evening , at the end of the hour  --  it had , in fact , been always more than an hour  --  he had joined in the applause . Then he had hurried out the door , jammed his hat on , lighted his pipe , and walked slowly homeward . He had walked slowly for two reasons . In the first place , there was something genuine and wholesome about the fresh air . In the second place , he had plenty of time if hewalked slowly to try to square himself with himself for having sat there and listened . He had never , of course , been able to square himself , but he had had time in which to cuss Wadham out . And that was something . In ten long years one picks up a good many ringing epithets and cuss words , words that , as Stevenson says somewhere about words in general , come bidding to be used . Well , Higgins had used them all , off and on . But none was the equal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noun . Higgins had actually thanked God for the word . Why should n't he ? God must be good , he had often told himself , to have supplied man with a word like that . He was suddenly aware of the night  --  the tiny star pulsings and the full , round glow of the moon . The universe must , after all , be moral . At the heart of things , that is , there must be a profound sense of right and wrong . Higgins had , ordinarily , little faith in man . He had little faith in himself . He should have denounced Wadham long ago . And yet , man , in the lump , must be damnably wise . Or rather there had been a few wise men to leaven the lump . Mind and matter . The universe was a universe of mind in spite of such clods as Wadham . In the end mind would triumph . Prophetic of that triumph was its gift to man of that little word . It was a good hour 's walk from Hig-gins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to hold forth on the Book of Job . Higgins was , as usual , on his way there . He kicked himself for being on his way there , but he was on his way , nevertheless . Still , there was a difference . This time he had made up his mind to let the lecture run along for half an hour , say , and then he would jump to his feet and call Wadham an ass . It was a thing that for years he had been intending to do . Well , he would make amends for his long silence by doing it to-night . He must do it to-night . Higgins looked rather young . But he was n't young . He was fifty . And after fifty there is not much time left . Anything might happen . His heart . The doctor had ordered him to give up smoking . He had n't , though , given it up . He somehow relished the idea of standing out against the doctor . He had stood out against so few things  --  openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Wadham . He would call Wad-ham an ass . It would create a stir . But why should n't he , for once in his life , create a stir ? The Chancellor would be there . The Chancellor was always there . The Chancellor was everywhere . The fact is that Higgins would n't have gone to hear Wadham more than once had the Chancellor not always been there . The Chancellor , he reflected , had a way of counting noses . Or was it the Chancellor 's wife ? Anyhow , that was one of the worst things about a small church school . They counted noses . Wadham was , moreover , Higgins ' colleague ; and one owed it to his colleagues to listen to what they had to say whether one 's colleagues had anything to say or not . Job , the man of Uz , as Wadham had published him on his placards . Job and Wadham . Job among the ashes . Job covered with sores , and Wadham there to dwell onthe ashes and expatiate on the sores . Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did Job know the word or its equivalent ? He should have known it . He had had bitter need of it . The history of damning vocables , Higgins reflected , as he passed the city library , would be the record of man 's intellectual and moral achievement . There was a profound resentment and protest in such words . Or they were so many verbal clubs with which men of common sense had bludgeoned the fools of the world , bludgeoned them , occasionally , perhaps , into momentary silence , just as , this night , he hoped to bludgeon Wadham into a golden moment of silence . It would , of course , be only a moment , for Wadham would go on . Wadham always went on . Wadham would , unquestionably , go on and finish his speech . Then , two weeks hence he would talk again ; every fortnight , in fact , thereafter . And the Chancellor would be there . More people than ever would be there . The Chancellor . The people . They liked Wadham . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have the Chancellor to reckon with . The Chancellor would fix Higgins . He would be glad , doubtless , of a chance to fix Higgins . For one thing , the Chancellor did n't approve of Higgins ' pipe . But it would be worth it all . Luckily , Higgins did n't have a wife and family , though here again , it seemed , he came in for the Chancellor 's disapproval . The Chancellor had a notion that without a wife and children one could not know the richer meanings of life . Higgins recalled that the Chancellor had had three wives . He had had two , that is , and was now undergoing the third . A wizened-up , chin-whiskered little fellow , but with an ungodly constitution , Three wives . Three of them . Good God ! But anyhow , Higgins had only himself to look out for . And whatever the consequences of this evening , they would be a small price for that moment when he , John Higgins , would come to his feet . In that moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the beginning of time , had suffered , or were now suffering , from Wadhams . To whom , he wondered , had that little word been first applied ? Better yet , who had been the man first to apply it ? He would like to shake hands with that man and with all men whosoever that had , at the end of their patience , jumped up and called someone an ass . The philologists had , he felt , neglected an opportunity in not having made a study of words like this . Or had they overlooked these words ? Probably not . They seldom overlooked anything . Wadham , by the way , was something of a philologist . He was a little of everything , Wadham was . But he was all of an ass . Higgins recalled men who had known the word , known it , that is , really  --  known it as a thing of life . They were wise , these men . They were mature . One of the surest signs of maturity is that a man prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain sense we may be said to live only as we make such words our own . Some words we never make ours . They are too much for us , too far above us . A word like this one , for example . To many people it could never rightfully belong . But there had been men of Higgins ' acquaintance whose word it was . They often came to his mind . His father , for instance . His father had been a preacher , a Methodist preacher of the old school . Higgins pictured him now as , some forty years ago , he had called his leading deacon an ass . The deacon  --  Gore , his name was  --  had agitated a movement against the tough element intown . It was a little town , with only one saloon and three churches . To start things off , the deacon asked Higgins ' father to flay Mart Fabian . Mart was the saloon-keeper . But Higgins ' father would n't use his pulpit to flay Mart . For one thing , he liked Mart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , to such a matter as Christian charity . But he would n't have flayed Mart even if he had n't liked him . The deacon got the whole church up in arras against Higgins ' father and brought the presiding elder over from the county seat . The presiding elder tried to calm things down , but they would n't calm down . So Higgins ' father had to resign . But some time before he resigned he met Gore down town on the street . A. number of people were standing about . Higgins was only a little shaver then , but he bad been there , too , his hand in his father 's hand . His father and the deacon had talked for a minute or so , and then his father had called the deacon an ass . It had frightened Higgins , the quick pressure of his father 's hand and the deep quietness of his voice . He wondered why his father had said that . But he knew now , and he was glad . It was a fine thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached . But the word had not , in that far-off day , been Higgins ' word . It had been his father 's word . And his father had used it well . But now Higgins- was grown up , and the word was his , too . Forty years had given him the word . Or was it his ? Could he really claim the word until such time as he should have used it openly and bravely , as his father had used it . Well , he would prove title to it to-night even though he lost his job just as his father had lost his . The ability to use that word in the right place was , he knew now , a test of a man 's intelligence . And the APROPOS OF ASSES courage so to use it was a test of a man 's character . In a little while he would be at the auditorium . There was the seven-fifty train pulling out for the West , and whistling every now and then for a crossing . Higgins liked the whistle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were on that one . It would not be long , though , after this night , until the Chancellor would give him numerous reasons for taking some train or other . But anyhow it was good to hear the whistle . It was fine to have ears for sounds like that . With these same ears , though , one must listen to Wad-ham . Ears . These twin appendages , as Lamb called them . What would Lamb have thought of Wadham ? Ears were funny things . Good for nothing unless there was somewhat to be heard . That was the way with life . This or that because of something else . The thorn in the side . But the thorn was nothing without the side . So , too , with words . That little monosyllable in particular . It , also , had a reason for being . Many reasons , in fact . People like Wadham , for example . Wadham on the man of Uz . Wadham on anything . Paradoxically enough , however , the world , so far as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debt . For it was the Wadhams who , after all , occasioned the word 's currency , insured it , moreover , against that verbal decrepitude which overtakes so many words . But there must , of course , be someone with the good sense to apply the word , someone to hammer the Wad-hams . Higgins thought it a hopeful sign , in a way , that the expression was widely current in America , and he accounted it no mean privilege to have heard it in the mouths of men in all walks of life , His own barber , a not incompetent judge of epithetical fiavors , was given to the word ; likewise , a doctor he knew , and an old-time negro . It was a downright pleasure , moreover , to come across the word in print . Mark Twain had used it , Higgins suspected , with more gusto than any other writer . And he felt a certain kinship with Mark , for he , Higgins , would use it , too , and that shortly . In a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pitcher and a glass . Midway in his lecture he would pause , fill the glass slowly and then as slowly drain it . Wadham always did this did it , Higgins knew , for an effect . To-night , however , Higgins would create an effect on his own account . It would be just after Wad-ham had set the glass down , clinking it a little against the pitcher and then moving it , with a thoughtful hand , six inches , say , from the pitcher . Well , the clinking would n't have died away when Higgins would spring to his feet and clink , or rather clang , that little noun on the sound-box , so to speak , of Wadham 's head . But first there were the people entering the auditorium . Higgins could see them now , over a block away . He drew nearer . The Chancellor and his wife were doubtless already inside , already in their seats up front . You could depend on the Chancellor . He was always in a room ahead of you , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a space that you must fill . Higgins felt , though , that he had always filled , as it were , only a little space in the Chancellor 's eyes . Higgins in a little space . Wadham in a big space . Wadham on the platform . But no , the Chancellor and his wife had n't gone in yet . They were just crossing from the other side of the street . They were on the sidewalk now , just ahead of Higgins . A monstrously big woman , the Chancellor 's wife . Or did she look that way merely because the Chancellor himself was such a little fellow ? Anyhow , she was a waddling bulk that crowded the Chancellor , now and then , off the sidewalk . But he would see her under the sod yet , along with the other two , Higgins fancied . Higgins hoped the Chancellor had n't caught sight of him But the Chancellor had , somehow , and was waiting for him at the steps . One could n't escape the Chancellor . Higgins thrust his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Chancellor . " I knew you by your hat . " It was true Higgins did look like his hat . He cursed his hat . But then if it had n't been his hat it would have been something else . " You 'll have to begin wearing another hat , Professor , " laughed the Chancellor 's wife , as she gave him her hand . She had a deep , corpulent laugh and a fat , but strong , compelling hand , a hand that could , Higgins had often thought , make or unmake professors . " Well , it is n't so much the hat as what 's under the hat , eh , Higgins ? " said the Chancellor . With his thumb he poked Higgins in the ribs . The Chancellor enjoyed a pleasantry or so . It kept the school in good spirits . But just what , Higgins wondered , did he mean by poking him , Higgins , in the ribs ? He had never done that before . It was a thing Higgins had n't counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . Had Wad-ham ever , Higgins asked himself , been poked in the ribs by the Chancellor ? But the little Chancellor had Higgins by the arm . His wife was on up the steps , talking to a couple of faculty women . The Chancellor was saying something in a low voice . " Between you and me , Higgins , and the gate-post , it 's good of you to get out so regularly . I know how you feel . But you 'll find them everywhere  --  everywhere , Higgins , everywhere . He makes a big hit , though , with the people and the trustees  --  with the trustees , Higgins . " Higgins stood there for a moment , not knowing what to think or say . That poke in the ribs . Now this . Was the Chancellor up to some game ? He turned and caught the other 's eye , and he felt suddenly sorry for the little Chancellor . He took him by the hand . Three wives . The trustees . And on top of all that , Wadham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to her , though , Higgins , " whispered the Chancellor . " She thinks he 's hot stuff , too . " Then arm in arm Higgins and the Chancellor went up the steps . But just as they got to the door the Chancellor held back and drew Higgins aside . " He 's not hot stuff , though , Higgins . He 's an infernal ? " " Your pardon , Chancellor , but allow me ? " " No , Higgins , no . In this I 'll stand on whatever prerogative may still be mine . You sha n't say it for me , Higgins . All these years , Higgins , I 've been holding in , but now I 'll out with it . He 's an ass , Higgins , an infernal ass ! " " And yet , withal , " said Higgins , " an inconsequential ass . " " Alas , Higgins , not so . Not an inconsequential ass . The trustees , Higgins . Remember the trustees . An ass he is , but an ass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ass , nevertheless , " said Higgins . " A blasted and colossal ass ! " " Agreed , Higgins , agreed , " said the little Chancellor . " An ass , as it were , of the first magnitude . A most phenomenal and stupendous ass ! " Then they went inside , Higgins reflecting the while that the adjectives did after all help somewhat .
