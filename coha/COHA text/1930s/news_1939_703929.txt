txt Britain 's guarantees extend to The Netherlands , Switzerland and Denmark , Prime Minister Chamberlain indicated yesterday , at the same time as he promised that the government would hold military talks with all the countries to which pledges had been given .

LONDON , April ** Minister Neville Chamberlain assured the House of Commons today that Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it was apparent from his guarded answers to questioners that the pace of the effort was slowing down . The Anglo-Russian talks have been suspended pending the arrival in Moscow of Ambassador Ivan Maisky , who flew from London this morning for consultations with his chiefs . The Anglo-Turkish conversations are much farther advanced , but they , too , are moving slowly in their final stages , and their outcome may be affected by decisions reached in Moscow in the next few days . Thera is no doubt of the British eagerness to guarantee Turkey or of the Turkish willingness to receive a British pledge and accept important obligations in return . But the Turks are anxious not to give too much publicity to their acceptance of counter-obligations , such as a pledge to other Balkan States and an agreement regarding the use of the Dardanelles to help Rumania in the event of aggression . Accordingly , Mr. Chamberlain had to follow his cautious procedure of the early days of the Anglo-Polish negotiations , when he explained he could not " throw all the cards upon the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question today , he simply said : " His Majesty 's Government has continued its close consultation with other interested governments , including the government of the U. S. S. R. I am not yet in a position to add anything to the statement made on behalf of the government in the course of the debate on April 13 . " In that debate Mr. Chamberlain announced the British pledges to Greece and Rumania . ) But Mr. Chamberlain did add something today by promising that " the government will maintain all necessary contacts in military as in all matters " with the countries with which military obligations had been undertaken . These countries now include not only Poland , Greece and Rumania , but also France , Portugal , Egypt and Iraq , with which Britain had previous commitments . " Interest " in Other States As for The Netherlands , Switzerland and Denmark , Mr. Chamberlain told another questioner : " His Majesty 's Government has entered into no specific engagements with the three countries named . It is unnecessary for me to insist on the interest that His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Although Mr. Chamberlain 's answer was literally correct , it did not tell the whole story . It has been generally understood that when President Albert Lebrun of France visited London last month Mr. Chamberlain agreed with Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet of France that the two countries would resist any aggression against the independence of The Netherlands or Switzerland and that when Foreign Minister Josef Beck of Poland was here the case of a threat against Danish independence was similarly discussed . There is no question of entering into a " specific engagement " with any of these three countries , which are all anxious to remain neutral ; any engagements concerning them have been made among Britain , France and Poland . Mr. Chamberlain told the House briefly of the " great satisfaction " with which the British Government welcomed President Roosevelt 's message to the German and Italian dictators last week-end . Earl De La Warr , President of the Board of Education , speaking at Edinburgh today , expressed the government 's appreciation more warmly when he said that this country 's response had been immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome the fact , " said Lord De La Warr , " that Chancellor Hitler and Premier Mussolini have not given a hasty or negative answer . There is no hostility or bitterness in this country against the German people , but there is a spirit of determination to prevent further aggression which any wise nation will hesitate to challenge . " But- guarantees and alliances must have force behind them if they are to be effective , Lord De La Warr went on . And , in a hint that may be significant , he declared that sacrifices must come from capital as well as from labor . " Either this country must mobilize its maximum strength here and now , " he said , " or we shall continue to be blown hopelessly before the advancing gale . " It is not yet clear how far the government is ready to go to mobilize all its strength . Nevertheless , Mr. Chamberlain made one advance today beyond his previous policy when he hinted to the Commons that the government had at last decided to establish a Ministry of Supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Chamberlain said he could make no announcement about it today , but he hoped to do so in the near future . It is understood that such a department will primarily be concerned with army supplies , as the Air Ministry is having no difficulty in getting all the supplies it needs and the Admiralty has always been able to take care of its own needs , even in the days of the Ministry of Munitions during the i World War .
