Commander John Hanson challenges an appalling denizen of the watery world Hydrot . Illustration : His head reared itself from the ground . " Good afternoon , sir , " nodded Correy as I entered the navigating room . He glanced down at the two glowing three-dimensional navigating charts , and drummed restlessly on the heavy frames . " Afternoon , Mr. Correy . Anything of interest to report ? " " Not a thing , sir ! " growled my fire-eating first officer . " I 'm about ready to quit the Service and get a job on one of the passenger liners , just on the off chance that something exciting might eventually happen . " " You were born a few centuries too late , " I chuckled . Correy loved a fight more than any man I ever knew . " The Universe has become pretty well quieted down . " " Oh , it is n't that ; it 's just this infernal routine . Just one routine patrol after another ; they should call it the Routine Patrol Service . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " At the moment , Correy meant every word he said . Even old-timers develop cases of nerves , now and then , on long tours of duty in small ships like the Ertak . Particularly men like Correy , whose bodies crave physical action . There was n't much opportunity for physical activity on the Ertak ; she was primarily a fighting ship , small and fast , with every inch of space devoted to some utilitarian use . I knew just how Correy felt , because I 'd felt the same way a great many times . I was young , then , one of the youngest commanders the Special Patrol Service had ever had , and I recognized Correy 's symptoms in a twinkling . " We 'll be re-outfitting at the Arpan sub-base in a couple of days , " I said carelessly . " Give us a chance to stretch our legs . Have you seen anything of the liner that spoke to us yesterday ? " I was just making conversation , to get his mind out of its unhealthy channel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her early this morning , lumbering along like the big fat pig that she is . " A pig , I should explain , is a food animal of Earth ; a fat and ill-looking creature of low intelligence . " The old Ertak went by her as though she were standing still . She 'll be a week and more arriving at Arpan . Look : you can just barely make her out on the charts . " I glanced down at the twin charts Correy had indicated . In the center of each the red spark that represented the Ertak glowed like a coal of fire ; all around were the green pinpricks of light that showed the position of other bodies around us . The Kabit , while comparatively close , was just barely visible ; her bulk was so small that it only faintly activated the super-radio reflex plates upon the ship 's hull . " We 're showing her a pretty pair of heels , " I nodded , studying our position in both dimensions . " Arpan is n't registering yet , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right , sir , " replied Correy . " Most useless world in the Universe , I guess . No good even for an emergency base . " " She 's not very valuable , certainly , " I admitted . " Just a ball of water whirling through space . But she does serve one good purpose ; she 's a sign-post it 's impossible to mistake . " Idly , I picked up Hydrot in the television disk , gradually increasing the size of the image until I had her full in the field , at maximum magnification. * * * * * Hydrot was a sizable sphere , somewhat larger than Earth -- my natural standard of comparison -- and utterly devoid of visible land . She was , as I had said , just a ball of water , swinging along uselessly through space , although no doubt there was land of some kind under that vast , unending stretch of gray water , for various observers had reported , in times past , bursts of volcanic steam issuing from the water . Indeed , as I looked , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot not far from the equator of the strange world . In the television disk , it looked like a tiny wisp of white , barely visible against the gray water , but in reality it must have been a mighty roaring column of smoke and steam and erupted material . " There 's life in the old girl , anyway , " I commented , indicating the image in the disk . " See her spout ? " We bent over the disk together , watching the white feather of steam . " First time I 've ever seen that , " said Correy . " I know volcanic activity has been reported before , but -- look , sir ! There 's another -- two more ! " Undoubtedly , things were happening deep in the bowels of Hydrot . There were now three wisps of steam rising from the water , two of them fairly close together , the other a considerable distance away , arranged to form a very long pointed triangle , the short base of which ran close to the equator , its longer sides reaching toward one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to view the image . The columns of steam seemed to increase in size . Certainly they mounted higher into the air . I could imagine the terrific roar of them as they blasted their way through the sullen water and hurled it in steaming spray around their bases , while huge stones fell hissing into the water on all sides . The eruption must have shaken the entire sphere ; the gushing of those vomiting throats was a cataclysm of such magnitude that I could not guess its effect . Correy and I watched tensely , hardly breathing . I think we both felt that something was about to happen : a pent-up force had been released , and it was raging . We could almost hear the rumble of the volcanic explosions and the ear-splitting hiss of the escaping steam . Suddenly Correy clutched my arm . " Look ! " he whispered , " Look ! " I nodded , not trusting myself to speak . I could see the water crawling inside the triangle formed by the three wisps of steam : crawling in white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlong , in mighty tidal waves , away from the center of that triangle . The columns of steam flared up with fresh strength , darkening as though with smoke . Here and there within the triangle black specks appeared , grew larger , and ran together in crooked lines that widened continually . " A -- a new continent , sir ! " said Correy almost reverently . " We 've seen a new continent born . " Correy had put my thoughts into words . We had seen a new continent born ; on the gray surface of Hydrot there was now a great irregular black blotch from which mounted three waving pillars of smoke and steam . Around the shores of the new continent the waters raged , white and angry , and little threads of white crawled outward from those shores -- the crests of tidal waves that must have towered into the air twice the Ertak 's length . Slowly , the shore-line changed form as fresh portions arose , and others , newly-risen , sank again beneath the gray water . The wisps of steam darkened still more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fed them had been exhausted by the travail of a new continent . " Think , sir , " breathed Correy , " what we might find if we landed there on that new continent , still dripping with the water from which it sprang ! A part of the ocean 's bed , thrust above the surface to be examined at will -- Could n't we leave our course long enough to -- to look her over ? " I confess I was tempted . Young John Hanson , Commander of the Special Patrol ship , Ertak , had his good share of natural curiosity , the spirit of adventure , and the explorer 's urge . But at the same time , the Service has a discipline that is as rigid and relentless as the passing of time itself . Hydrot lay off to starboard of our course : Arpan , where we were to re-outfit , was ahead and to port , and we were already swinging in that direction . The Ertak was working on a close schedule that gave us no latitude . " I 'm afraid it ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking my head . " We 'll report it immediately , of course , and perhaps we 'll get orders to make an investigation . In that case --  " " Not the Ertak ! " interrupted Correy passionately . " They 'll send a crew of bug-eyed scientists there , and a score or so of laboratory men to analyze this , and run a test on that , and the whole mess of them will write millions of words apiece about the expedition that nobody will ever read . I know . " " Well , we 'll hope you 're wrong . " I said , knowing in my heart that he was perfectly right . " Keep her on her present course , Mr. Correy . " " Present course it is , sir ! " snapped Correy . Then we bent together over the old-fashioned hooded television disk staring down silently and regretfully at the continent we had seen born , and which , with all its promise of interest and adventure , we must leave behind , in favor of a routine stop at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gladly given years of our lives to turn the Ertak 's blunt nose toward Hydrot , but we had our orders , and in the Service as it was in those days , an officer did not question his orders . * * * * * Correy mooned around the Arpan sub-base like a fractious child . Kincaide and I endeavored to cheer him up , and Hendricks , the Ertak 's young third officer , tried in vain to induce Correy to take in the sights . " All I want to know , " Correy insisted , " is whether there 's any change in orders . You got the news through to Base , did n't you , sir ? " " Right . All that came back was the usual ' Confirmed . ' No comment . " Correy muttered under his breath and wandered off to glare at the Arpanians who were working on the Ertak . Kincaide shrugged and shook his head . " He 's spoiling for action , sir , " he commented . Kincaide was my second officer ; a cool-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever wore the blue-and-silver uniform of the Service . " I only hope -- message for you , sir . " He indicated an Arpanian orderly who had come up from behind , and was standing at attention . " You 're wanted immediately in the radio room , sir , " said the orderly , saluting . " Very well , " I nodded , returning the salute and glancing at Kincaide . " Perhaps we will get a change in orders after all . " I hurried after the orderly , following him down the broad corridors of the administration building to the radio room . The commander of the Arpan sub-base was waiting there , talking gravely with the operator . " Bad news , Commander , " he said , as I entered the room . " We 've just received a report from the passenger liner Kabit , and she 's in desperate straits . At the insistence of the passengers , the ship made contact with Hydrot and is unable to leave . She has been attacked by some strange monster , or several of them -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to report the matter to Base yourself . " " Yes . Thank you , sir . Operator , please raise Base immediately ! " * * * * * The Kabit ? That was the big liner we had spoken to the day before Correy and I had seen the new continent rise above the boundless waters of Hydrot . I knew the ship ; she carried about eighteen hundred passengers , and a crew of seventy-five men and officers . Beside her , the Ertak was a pygmy ; that the larger ship , so large and powerful , could be in trouble , seemed impossible . Yet --  " Base , sir , " said the operator , holding a radio-menore toward me . I placed the instrument on my head . " John Hanson , Commander of the Special Patrol ship Ertak emanating . Special report for Chief of Command . " " Report , Commander Hanson , " emanated the Base operator automatically . " Word has just been received at Arpan sub-base that passenger liner Kabit made contact with Hydrot , landing somewhere on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kabit reports itself in serious difficulties , exact nature undetermined , but apparently due to hostile activity from without . Will await instructions . " " Confirmed . Commander Hanson 's report will be put through to Chief of Command immediately . Stand by . " I removed the radio-menore , motioning to the operator to resume his watch . Radio communication in those days was in its infancy . Several persons who have been good enough to comment upon my previous chronicles of the Special Patrol Service , have asked " But , Commander Hanson ! Why did n't you just radio for assistance ? " forgetting as young persons do , that things have not always been as they are to-day . The Ertak 's sending apparatus , for example , could reach out at best no more than a day 's journey in any direction , and then only imperfectly . Transmission of thought by radio instead of symbols or words , had been introduced but a few years before I entered the Service . It must be remembered that I am an old , old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of the Universe was born -- that I am writing of men who , for the larger part , have long since embarked upon the Greatest Adventure . * * * * * " Base , sir , " said the operator after a moment , and I hastily slipped on the radio-menore . " Commander John Hanson , standing by , " I shot at the operator at Base . " Have you orders ? " " Orders for Captain John Hanson , Commander of the Special Patrol ship Ertak , " emanated the operator in a sort of mental drone . " Chief of Command directs that the Ertak proceed immediately to the scene of the reported difficulty , and take any necessary steps to relieve same . I will repeat the orders , " and he droned through them a second time . " Orders are understood . The results of our operations will be reported to Base as soon as possible . " I tore off the radio-menore and hurried from the room , explaining to the sub-base commander as I went . Correy was standing beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they both looked around quickly and hopefully . " What 's up , sir ? " asked Correy , reading news in my face . " A change in orders ? " " Correct ! That big liner , the Kabit , landed on Hydrot , and she 's in some sort of mysterious trouble . Orders from the Chief himself are to proceed there immediately . Are any men away from the ship on leave ? " " If there are , we can do without them ! " shouted Correy . " I 'll stand a double watch . " " The crew is on duty , sir , " said Kincaide quietly . " Mr. Hendricks is aboard directing the taking on of supplies . We can leave any time you order , sir . " " We leave immediately , gentlemen , " I said . " Mr. Correy , will you give the necessary orders ? " " Yes , sir ! " grinned Correy , his eyes dancing like a schoolboy 's . He was in the navigating room jabbing attention signals and snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more leisurely , had entered the ship . * * * * * Hurtling through space at maximum speed , it took us two days , Earth time , to come close enough to Hydrot so that we could locate the unfortunate Kabit . She had landed on a level plain near the shore of the new continent , where she lay , just a tiny bright speck , even under the maximum power of our television disk . " It 's an odd thing , sir , that we ca n't raise her by radio , " commented Hendricks , who was on duty . " Have we tried recently ? " " We 've been trying constantly , at intervals of but a few minutes , " I replied grimly . " Several times , the operator reports , he has been able to get a muffled and garbled response , utterly unintelligible . He says that the signals sound as though the radio emanation-plates in her outer hull were damaged or grounded . We 'll just have to wait until we get there . " " As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her atmosphere , so that we can break out masks , if necessary . " Hendricks , while young and rather too impulsive , was a good rough-and-ready scientist , as well as a courageous and dependable officer . " When Mr. Correy relieves you , please inform him that I am taking a watch below , should he need me . " Hydrot was looming up in the television disk , and I wished to be rested and ready for action when we landed . * * * * * I was awakened by an uncomfortable warmth , and when I glanced at my watch the explanation was obvious . We had penetrated the outer gaseous envelope of the world that had so recently given birth to a continent , and Correy was driving the Ertak through at reckless speed . When I entered the navigating room , Correy glanced up guiltily at the surface-temperature gauge and then hastily saluted . " We 're reducing speed , sir , " he said . " Atmosphere is rather denser than I had expected . Hendricks reports the air breathable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , what do you make of the appearance of the Kabit now ? " I bent over the hooded television disk anxiously . The Kabit was in the center of the field , and the image was perhaps a third of the disk 's diameter in length . Instead of a tiny bright speck , I could see now the fat bulk of the ship , its bright metal gleaming -- but across or around the ship , were broad spiral bands of black or dark green , as sharp as though they had been painted there . " What are the bands , Mr. Correy ? " I asked sharply . " Have you formed any opinion ? " " I have , sir , but I 'd rather not offer it at this time , " said my first officer gravely . " Look about the ship , in the immediate vicinity , and see if you find anything of interest . My eyes may be playing me tricks . " I glanced curiously at Correy , and then bent my attention on the image in the disk . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any details of the background , save that the country round seemed to be fairly level , with great pools of gray water standing here and there , and a litter , as of gigantic , wilted vegetation , spread over everything . And then , as I looked , it seemed to me that the Kabit shifted position slightly . At the same time , the spiral bands seemed to move , and upon the ground around the ship , there was movement also . I looked up from the disk , feeling Correy 's eyes upon me . We stared at each other , neither wishing to speak -- hardly daring to speak . There are some things too monstrous to put into words . " You -- you saw it , sir ? " asked Correy at last , his voice scarcely more than a whisper . " I do n't know . I think I saw something like a -- a snake . Is that what you mean ? " " Yes . Something like a snake . A snake that has wrapped itself around the Kabit , holding it helpless ... a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror in his eyes . I think he had convinced himself he had only imagined the serpent , until I had seen the same thing . " Have you stopped to think , Mr. Correy , " I asked slowly , " how long the creature would have to be to wrap itself like that around a liner the size of the Kabit ? It -- it ca n't be ! " " I know it , sir , " nodded Correy . " I know it . And still , I saw it , and you saw it . " " Yes , " I muttered . " I saw it . I -- I saw it move ! " * * * * * We maintained a speed that kept the surface-temperature gauge dangerously close to maximum permissible reading , and despite the forced ventilation of the ship , we were dripping with perspiration . Atmospheric speeds are maddeningly low after the reckless , hurtling speed of space travel , but our vaunted scientists have n't yet found a way of eliminating friction , and we had to make the best of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew larger and clearer , relentlessly confirming our original conclusion . The Kabit was wrapped in the coils of a mighty serpent ; a monster that must have been the height of a man in diameter , and whose length I could not even guess . Four coils were looped tightly about the Kabit , and we could now see the terrible tail of the thing , and its head . I have always been glad that the details of that ghastly head became visible gradually : viewed suddenly , in full relief , it was a sight that might well have threatened the reason of any man . The serpent 's mouth was lined with a triple row of long , fang-like teeth , tilted gullet-ward at a sharp angle , and the breathing holes were elevated to form warty excrudescences near the end of the snoutish upper jaw . Long colorless tentacles fringed the horrible mouth : barbels that writhed incessantly , as though they sought food for the rapacious jaws they guarded . From a point slightly above and to the rear of the tiny , ruby eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , rose twice the height of a man . Like the antennae of a butterfly , they were surmounted by tiny knobs , and were in constant motion . The whole head was armored with great plates or scales , dark green in color ; and apparently of tremendous thickness . A short distance behind the head were two tremendous reddish-brown fins , with strong supporting spines that seemed to terminate in retractile claws . In the water , these fins would undoubtedly be of tremendous value in swimming and in fighting , but on land they seemed rather useless . Aside from a rudimentary dorsal fin , a series of black , stubby spines , connected by a barely visible webbing , the thing had no other external evidences of its marine origin . " You 've been restless for action , Mr. Correy , " I commented grimly . " I believe this chap will give us all you could desire . " Correy , still staring down into the disk , fascinated by the terrible details there , shook his head . " It should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The ray will make quick work of him once we 're within distance . " " Yes -- and of the Kabit and all on board , " I reminded him . " If he has the strength his size would indicate , he would crush the liner in his death agonies , or , failing that , would heave it about so violently that those within would be maimed or killed outright . This is a case for cunning , and not might . " " I think , sir , both cunning and might will be needed , " said Correy soberly , looking up from the disk . " Cunning alone will not dispose of that lad . Have you any plans ? " " Rough plans only ; we 'll have to develop them as we go along . We do n't know what we 'll be up against . We 'll land a safe distance away , and a small expeditionary force will attack as it sees fit ; probably , dividing itself into two or three units . The Ertak will be manned by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect itself or , if possible , to aid any of the expeditionary parties . " " What weapons , sir ? " asked Correy , his eyes gleaming . " I 'll give the orders now ! " " It 's too soon for that ; it 'll be an hour at least before we land . But I believe every man , including officers , should be armed with pistols , at least six atomic bombs , and there should be a field disintegrator-ray unit for each party . And each member must be equipped with a menore ; communication will be by menore only . You might call Mr. Kincaide and Mr. Hendricks , and we 'll hold a little council of war . " " Right , sir ! " said Correy , and picked up the microphone . Kincaide and Hendricks were in the room almost within the minute . We laid our plans as best we could , but they were n't very definite . Only a few things were certain . Somehow , we must induce the monster to release his grasp on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the big liner and her passengers were safe . It was a desperate mission ; an enterprise not of the Ertak , but of individuals . " One thing is certain , sir , " commented Correy , taking over by visual navigation , and reducing speed still more , " you must remain in charge of the ship . You will be needed --  " " I understand your motives , Mr. Correy , " I interrupted , " but I do not agree with you . As Commander of the Ertak , I shall command the activities of her men . You will have charge of one landing force , and Mr. Hendricks of another . You , Mr. Kincaide , I shall ask to remain in charge of the ship . " " Very well , sir , " nodded Kincaide , swallowing his disappointment . I should have liked to have Kincaide with me , for he was level-headed and cool in an emergency -- but it was because of these very things that I wanted him in charge of the Ertak . " We 're close enough now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in Correy . " There 's a likely spot , a safe distance away and apparently level , almost on the shore . Shall I set her down there ? " " Use your own judgment , Mr. Correy . You may order the landing force to arm and report at the exit port . As soon as you have made contact , you and Mr. Hendricks will report to me there . " Mr. Kincaide , you will remain on duty here . I am leaving the conduct of the ship entirely to your judgment , asking you to remember only that the rescue of the Kabit and her nearly two thousand souls is the object of this expedition , and the safety of our own personnel can not be given primary consideration . " " I understand , sir , " nodded Kincaide gravely . He held out his hand in that familiar gesture of Earth , which may mean so much more than men ever dare put into words , and we shook hands silently . There were to be three landing parties of five men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty passenger liner in its coils ! " I wish , sir , that I were going in your place , " said Kincaide softly . " I know that . But -- waiting here will be the hardest job of all . I 'm leaving that for you . " I turned and hurried out of the room , to make my entries in the log -- perhaps my last entries -- and secure my equipment . * * * * * There are times , in setting down these old tales of the Special Patrol Service as it was before they tacked a " Retired " after my name and title , that I wish I had been a bit more studious during my youth . I find myself in need of words , and possessed only of memories . I wish I could think of words that would describe the sight that confronted us when we emerged from the Ertak and set foot upon the soil of that newly-born continent of Hydrot , but I find I can not . I have tried many times , and I find my descriptions fall far short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ground was a vast littered floor of wilted marine growths , some already rotting away , while others , more hardy , or with roots reaching into as yet undried ooze , retained a sort of freshness . Crab-like creatures scuttled in all directions , apparently feasting upon the plentiful carrion . The stench was terrible , almost overpowering at first , but after a few minutes we became accustomed to it , and , in the intensity of the work we had undertaken , it was forgotten . Progress was not possible on the ground . Sheltered from the sun by the thick growths it supported , it was still treacherously soft . But the giant marine vegetation that had retained something of its vigor provided a highway , difficult and dangerous and uncertain , but passable . I remained with the party taking the most direct route to the unfortunate Kabit , while Correy and Hendricks led the parties to my left and right , respectively . We kept in constant touch with each other by means of our menores . " I believe , " emanated Correy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good view of him a few seconds back , and his head was elevated and pointed this way . " " It 's possible , " I replied . " Be careful , however , to do nothing to alarm or excite him . All men must keep under cover , and proceed with as little noise and commotion as possible . I 'm going to see , now , if I can get in touch with anyone on the Kabit ; with full power , communication might be possible even through the Kabit 's grounded hull . " " It 's worth trying , " agreed Hendricks . " These new menores are powerful . " I adjusted the little atomic generator to maximum , and replaced the instrument on my head . " On board the Kabit ! " I emanated , trying by sheer mental effort to drive the thought over that stinking waste , and through the massive double hull of the liner . " Ahoy the Kabit ! " " This is Captain Gole , " flashed back the answer instantly . " Captain Gole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ertak ? " " Commander Hanson of the Ertak emanating . How are conditions on the Kabit ? " " Ghastly ! " I could sense the feeling in the word , faintly as it smote upon my consciousness . " My officers are keeping the crew under some sort of control , but the passengers are unmanageable . They are frantic -- insane with terror . Two or three have already gone mad . I am on the verge of insanity myself . Have you seen the thing that has us trapped ? " " Yes . We are coming to your aid . Tell your passengers to calm themselves . We 'll find a way out of this somehow . You know the motto of our Service . " " Yes : ' Nothing Less Than Complete Success ! ' I have already issued a bulletin to the effect that I am in contact with your ship . I think it has had a good effect . The clamor is quieting somewhat ; you do n't know what a terrible strain this has been , sir ! " I could well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Zenian , and the Zenians are too high-strung to stand up under a severe strain . " It may help us if you 'll tell us , very briefly , the history of your experience here , " I suggested . " We 're going up against something we know nothing about . Perhaps you can give us some valuable information . " " I doubt it , for there 's very little to tell . Undoubtedly , you have the report which I managed to get through to Arpan before our radio emanation plates were put out of commission . " Against my better judgment , we set down here upon the insistence of the passengers . The television instruments revealed nothing more dangerous than the small life in the marine growths left stranded by the receding water . " I unsealed one of the exit ports , and a small party of the more curious passengers , under the escort of my second officer and six men , ventured forth on a little tour of exploration . A goodly portion of the remaining passengers huddled close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suddenly there was a great sound of shouting from the exploring party . Not knowing the danger , but realizing that something was wrong , the passengers rushed into the ship . Helplessly , for we are utterly defenseless , I watched the fleeing party of explorers . " For a moment , I could not see why they fled ; I could only see them scrambling desperately toward the ship , and casting frightened glances behind them . Then I saw the thing 's head rear itself from the slimy tangle of vegetation , and behind it the wilting growths were lashed to shreds . " The head drove forward . My second officer , courageously bringing up the rear , was the first victim . Perhaps his bright uniform attracted the beast 's attention . I do n't know . " They were close now ; very close . I knew that we were in danger , and yet I could not bear to seal the port in the faces of those helpless men racing towards the ship . " I waited . Twice more the terrible head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleeing ranks . It was terrible -- ghastly . " The rest of them reached the ship , and as the last man came reeling through the port , the door swung shut and began spinning upon its threads . Almost instantly I gave the order for vertical ascent at emergency speed , but before the order could be obeyed , the ship lurched suddenly , rolled half over , and swung back with a jolt . As the power was applied , the ship rose at a crazy angle , hung there trembling for a moment , and then sank back to the ground . The load was too great . I knew then that we were in the power of the thing that had come wriggling out of that sea of rotting weeds . " I got the message off to Arpan before our radio emanation plates were grounded or destroyed by the coils of the monster . At intervals , I have tried to pull away , but each time the thing tightens its coils angrily , until the fabric of the ship groans under the strain . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been waiting for you to reach me with the menore . You have come at last , and I am at your orders . If you can not help us , we are lost , for we shall all go mad . " " We 'll have you in the clear very soon , " I assured him with a confidence I did not feel . " Stand by for further communications , and -- are your generators working ? " " Yes . They 're in perfect order . If only the beast would uncoil himself --  " " We 'll see to that very shortly . Stand by . " * * * * * I reduced power and asked Correy and Hendricks if they had both followed the conversation . They had , and had now reduced power , as I had done . We all realized that our counsels might not be reassuring to Captain Gole . " As I see it , gentlemen , the first thing we must do is to induce the beast to leave the Kabit . And the only way that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correy . " He 's hungry . He knows there 's food in the Kabit . If we can get him to leave the liner and come after us , the problem 's solved . " " But he can run faster than we . I can hardly crawl over this slimy mess , " objected Hendricks . " I 'm ready to try everything , but remember that we 've got to lead him away far enough to make him release the Kabit . " " I 've got it ! " emanated Correy suddenly , his enthusiasm making the vibrations from the menore fairly hammer into my brain . " I 'll cut a long , narrow swath with one of the portable disintegrator rays ; long enough to take him far away from the Kabit , and just wide enough to pass a man . I 'll run along this deep groove , just below the reach of the monster . I can make good time ; the serpent 'll have to slash and wriggle his way over or through this slimy growth . How 's that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hope of success , but its dangers were obvious . " What happens when you reach the end of the path the ray cuts ? " I asked grimly . " You and Hendricks , with your men , will be on both sides of the path , not opposite each other . When he passes , you 'll let go your disintegrator rays and the atomic bombs . He 'll be in a dozen pieces before we reach the end of the path . " * * * * * Spread out here before me , in all its wordy detail , it would seem that a long time must have elapsed while Captain Gole related his story , and my officers and myself laid our plans . As a matter of fact , communicating as we were by menore , it was only a minute or so since Correy had emanated his first comment : " I believe the beast sees us . His head was elevated and pointed this way . " And now Hendricks , who was peering over the ruffled edge of an undulating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Disobeying my strictest orders , he fairly screamed his frantic warning : " He sees us ! He sees us ! He 's coming ! " I ran up the twisted , concave surface of a giant stem of some kind . To my left , I could hear the shrill whine of Correy 's disintegrator ray generator , already in action , and protesting against a maximum load . To the right , Hendricks and his men were scrambling into position . Before me was the enemy . Slowly , deliberately , as though he did not doubt his terrible ability , he unwrapped his coils from the Kabit . His head , with its graceful antennae searching the air , and the tentacles around his mouth writhing hungrily , reared itself ten times a man 's height from the ground . His small red eyes flashed like precious stones . Beyond , the mighty greenish coils slashed the rotting weed as he unwrapped them from the Kabit . I snatched off my menore and adjusted it again for maximum power . " Captain Gole ! " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling and pitching . " " In a moment you 'll be free . When I signal ' Rise ! ' ascend as quickly as possible to a safe distance . Stand by ! " " Hendricks ! Be ready to follow Correy 's plan . It 's our only chance . In a second , now --  " The last coil moved , slipped from the blunt nose of the liner . " Rise ! " I ordered . " Rise ! " I saw the ship rock suddenly , and roar hollowly toward the sky . I felt the rush of wind made by her passing . Then , head still elevated and swaying , the two great reddish-brown fins fanning the air like grotesque wings , the serpent lashed out towards us , coming at amazing speed . * * * * * Correy , sure that he was observed by the serpent , leaped down from the huge leaf upon which he had been standing . Hendricks and I , followed by our men , scrambled desperately toward the deep path or lane that Correy 's ray had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan had given some promise of success , had we had time to put it into proper operation . As it was , neither Hendricks or I had had time to get into position . Hendricks , on my right , was working his way as rapidly as possible toward the path , but he had a long way to go . Unless a miracle happened , he would be too late to help . The portable ray machines would be helpless against such a mighty bulk , except at close range . I reached the path and glanced hastily to the right , the direction , from which the great serpent was sweeping down on us . He was less than the Ertak 's length away . " Hide , men ! " I ordered . " Under the vegetation -- in the muck -- anywhere ! " I glanced down the lane to the left , and saw , to my relief , that Correy and his men were a goodly distance away , and still far from the end of the swath their ray had cut for them . Then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a spongy , spotted growth , listening , above the pounding of my heart , to the rapid slithering of the serpent 's ponderous body . Of a sudden the sound stopped . I was conscious of an excited warning from Hendricks : " He 's stopped , sir ! Run ! He 's seen you ... he --  " Startled , I glanced up -- directly into the hideous face of the snake . * * * * * It seemed to me he was grinning . His mouth was partially open , and the pale , writhing barbels that surrounded his mouth seemed to reach out toward me . The long and graceful antennae were bent downward inquiringly , quivering tensely , and his small eyes glowed like wind-fanned coals of fire . The brownish fins were rigid as metal , the retractile claws unsheathed and cruelly curved . He was so close that I could hear the air rushing through his crater-like breathing holes . For an instant we stared at each other ; he with confident gloating : myself , too startled and horrified to move . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scaly head raked the clothes from one side of my body , and sent me , sprawling and breathless , into the welter of sagging weeds . I heard the sharp whine of my ray generator going into action , but I took no chances on the accuracy of my men . They were working under tremendous difficulties . As I fell , I snatched an atomic bomb from my belt , and , as the horrid head drew back to strike again , I threw the bomb with all my strength . I had thrown from an exceedingly awkward position , and the bomb exploded harmlessly some distance away , showering us with muck and slimy vegetation . Evidently , however , the explosion startled the serpent , for his head slewed around nervously , and I felt the ground tremble under me as his mighty coils lashed the ground in anger . Scrambling to my feet , I seized the projector tube of the disintegrator ray and swept the beam upward until it beat upon that terrible head . The thing screamed -- a high , thin sound almost past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me -- the heavy dust of disintegration . In the distance , I could hear the slashing of the tail as it tore through the rubbery growth of weeds . With half his head eroded by the ray , the serpent struck again , but this time his aim was wild . The mighty head half buried itself in the muck beside me , and I swung the projector tube down so that the full force of the ray tore into the region above and behind the eyes , where I imagined the brain to be . The heavy reddish dust fairly pelted from the ugly head . Correy had come running back . Dimly , I could hear him shouting . " Look out ! " I warned him . " Keep back , Correy ! Keep the men back ! I 've got him , but he 'll die hard --  " As though to prove my words true , the head , a ghastly thing eroded into a shapeless mass , was jerked from the mud , and two tremendous loops of tortured body came hurtling over my head . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hooked talons ripping one of Correy 's men into bloody shreds . Correy himself , caught in a desperate endeavor to save the unfortunate man , was knocked twenty feet . For one terrible instant , I thought the beast had killed Correy also . Gasping , Correy rose to his feet , and I ran to assist him . " Back , men ! " I shouted . " Hendricks ! Get away as far and as fast as you can . Back ! Back ! " Half dragging Correy , who was still breathless from the blow , I hurried after the men . Behind us , shaking the earth in his death agonies , the monstrous serpent beat the plain about him into a veritable sea of slime . * * * * * From a point of vantage , atop the Ertak , we watched for the end . " I have never , " said Correy in an awed voice , " seen anything take so long to die . " " You have never before , " I commented grimly , " seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty body ; it is but natural that , even with the brain disintegrated into dust , the body would not die immediately . " " Undoubtedly he has a highly decentralized nervous system , " nodded Hendricks , who was , as I have said , something of a practical scientific man , although no laboratory worker or sniveling scientist . " And instinct is directing him back toward the sea from which , all unwillingly , he came . Look -- he 's almost in the water . " " I do n't care where he goes , " said Correy savagely , " so he goes there as carrion . Clark was a good man , sir . " Clark was the man the serpent had killed . " True , " I said . Making the entry of that loss would hurt ; even though the discipline of the Service is -- or at least , used to be -- very rigid , officers get rather close to their men during the course of many tours of duty in the confines of a little ship like the Ertak . " But the Kabit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We all looked up . The Kabit was no longer visible . Battered , but still space-worthy , she had gone on her way . " I suppose , " grinned Correy , " that we 'll be thanked by radio . " The grin was real ; Correy had had action enough to make him happy for a time . The nervous tension was gone . " Probably . But -- watch our friend ! He 's in the water at last . I imagine that 's the last we 'll see of him . " * * * * * Half of the tremendous body was already in the water , lashing it into white foam . The rest of the great length slid , twitching , down the shore . The water boiled and seethed ; dark loops flipped above the surface and disappeared . And then , as though the giant serpent had found peace at last , the waters subsided , and only the wreaths of white foam upon the surface showed where he had sunk to the ooze that had given him birth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left is for the scientists to flock here to admire his bones . They 'll probably condemn us for ruining his skull . It took them a good many thousand years to find the remains of a sea-serpent on Earth , you remember . " " Some time in the Twenty-second Century , was n't it , sir ? " asked Hendricks . " I think my memory serves me well . " " I would n't swear to it . I know that sailors reported them for ages , but that would n't do for the laboratory men and the scientists . They had to have the bones right before them , subject to tests and measurements . " That 's the trouble with the scientists , I 've found . Their ability to believe is atrophied . They ca n't see beyond their laboratory tables . Of course , I 'm just an old man , and perhaps I 'm bitter with the drying sap of age . That 's what I 've been told . " Old John Hanson " they call me , and smile as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm old ! But the years behind me are not empty years . I did n't spend them bending over little instruments , or compiling rows of figures . And I was right about the scientists -- they did put in a protest concerning our thoughtlessness in ruining the head of the serpent . They could only estimate the capacity of the brain-pan , argue about the cephalic index , and guess at the frontal angle : it was a terrible blow to science . Bitter old John Hanson !
