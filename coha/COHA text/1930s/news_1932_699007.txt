The only exception is France , whom Mussolini proposes to keep stirred up by urging total disarmament .

Similarly , unless the Wall Street bears stage an unexpected and altogether improbable rally , college presidents will be in a position to assure us that democracy has not collapsed after all , but on the contrary is only entering on its heyday . Similarly , if the buoyancy in railroad bonds and municipals persists , we shall discover that the American people will never tolerate the timid French outlook upon life , with its insistence on thrift , its reluctance to take a chance , and its hostility to instalment selling . Similarly , it will be only a few more days now before the magazine editors are in a position to decide whether to fill up their October number with articles calling for a Planned United States or with articles describing America 's Comeback .

New York never remembers anything more than six months . If Mr. Walker is ousted now , people will have forgotten by the beginning of 1933 that there ever was a Tammany Mayor who fell somewhat short of the ideal .
