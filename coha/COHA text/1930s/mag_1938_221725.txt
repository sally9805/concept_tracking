How a ship 's captain may dislike vessel , ocean and passengers was comically demonstrated by Cinemactor Walter Connolly in The Captain Hates the Sea . Last week a real captain of a real ship was heard on the subject . Near Westport , Wash. , a bottled note cast overboard in mid-Pacific last July was washed ashore . It was written by Captain W. J. Fowler , then first officer of Oceanic &; Oriental Navigation Co. ' s Golden Horn which had just been through 18 days of rough weather . <P> " This vessel is bound from San Francisco to Yokohama and Oriental ports with general cargo and one passenger . In all , there are 41 souls aboard , that is if those damn fools who go to sea can have souls . . . . Should this be picked up by a boy contemplating a sea career , let him ... go into the purser 's department of an American company . After a surprising short time , by tattling on the ships ' officers for breaches of decorum ... he will be moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the 978 vice presidents . . . . Bless those others on these seas and give them better , faster ships , and in the generations to come give us honest shipowners who will give a thought to the man . ... I cast the bottle containing this into the bosom of the cruelest of mistresses , the sea . " <P> By last week when the note was found , Captain Fowler was selling automobile tires in San Francisco .
