txt Representative Christopher D. Sullivan was elected leader of Tammany yesterday at a meeting of its executive committee to succeed the late James J. Dooling . By the election of Mr. Sullivan , last of the original " Sullivan clan , " once a major power in the organization , control of Tammany Hall after many years returned to south of Fourteenth Street . County Clerk Albert Marinelli , who shares the leadership of the Second Assembly District with Mr. Sullivan , is now regarded as the most powerful Tammany district leader . Former Governor Alfred E. Smith and Surrogate James A. Foley were said to have had a large part ' in bringing about Mr. Sullivan 's election . The new leader announced that he would give active support to Senator Royal S. Copeland , TamMany candidate for the Democratic nomination for Mayor , and the latter 's associates , Frank J. Prial , candidate for Controller , and Borough President Samuel Levy , candidate for President of the Council . Mr. Sullivan replied in the negative to a question as to whether he expected to confer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the withdrawal of both Senator Copeland and Grover A. Whalen , the rival Mayoralty candidates , thus checking for the present the movement for the substitution of former Supreme Court Justice Jeremiah T , Mahoney . Candidates Designated Selection of candidates for Borough President and county offices were deferred until evening . In the meantime , Mr. Sullivan talked with Mr. Smith and Senator Copeland over the telephone , and received their congratulations . The evening meeting took only a few minutes and the following candidates were designated unani-mously : For Borough President  --  Alderman Timothy J. Sullivan , a leader of the Eighteenth Assembly District . For District Attorney  --  Assistant District Attorney Harold W. Hastings , member of the District Attorney 's staff since 1919 . For Sheriff  --  Daniel E. Finn Jr. , a leader of the First Assembly District . For Register  --  Miss Martha Byrne , incumbent . For Justices of the City Court ? Vincent S. Lippe , Henry S. Schimmel and Frank A. Carlin , incumbents ; Justice Carlin by appointment by Governor Lehman . Smith in Role of Adviser With Mr. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tammany , the organization , or approximately two-thirds of it , has become definitely anti-Roosevelt and anti-New Deal . On the present line-up the issue will be fought out in the primary election . District leaders opposed to the election of Mr. Sullivan expressed belief that he would have difficulty in continuing as Leader if Senator Copeland should be defeated in the primary . The unanimity of Mr. Sullivan 's election was merely technical . After William P. Kenneally , chairman of the executive committee , had called the meeting to order , Charles W. Culkin of the Third Assembly District moved that a vote be taken as to whether a leader should be elected forthwith . Mr. Marinelli was reported to have been active in directing the Sullivan supporters to vote for an immediate election . A standing vote was taken . More than a third of the committee members , it was said , voted against as immediate election , thereby registering their opposition to the election of Mr. Sullivan . Those opposed to the election of Mr. Sullivan , not so much from objection to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domi- nance of Mr. Marinelli , included members of the group headed by James J. Hines of the Eleventh District , who is allied with the proRoosevelt leaders of the other counties in support of Mr. Whalen and who suffered a perhaps only temporary defeat by the action of the committee . Mr. Sullivan then was placed in nomination by Clarence H. Neal Jr . of the Twentieth District , and seconded by William Solomon of the Seventeenth District , the , two district leaders credited with having been with Mr. Marinelli and the leaders in the surprise move to call an executive committee meeting over the head of Mr. Kenneally and line up a majority of its members for Mr. Sullivan . City Clerk Michael J. Cruise of the Twelfth District moved that nominations be closed and that the secretary be instructed to cast one ballot for Mr. Sullivan . This motion was adopted without dissent , and Bert Stand , the secretary , declared the ballot cast and Mr. Sullivan elected unanimously . Mr. Mahoney , leader of the Fifteenth District , congratulated Mr. Sullivan on his election and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan Thanks Committee Mr. Sullivan , addressing the committee , said : " I wish tr thank the members of this committee for the great honor you have conferred on me today . In return I want to promise each and every one of you to do all that is in my power to foster the success of the Democratic party . " Mr. Sullivan 's first official act as leader was to . ask Mr. Stand , who was appointed by Mr. Dooling , to continue as secretary of Tammany . During Mr. Dooling 's long illness Mr. Stand stood loyally by his chief , which for a time slightly estranged him from members of the Sullivan group , to which he naturally belongs . The cause of friction between Mr. Stand and members of the Sullivan group was , of course , removed when the latter formedan alliance with Mr. Dooling to support Senator Copeland . The committee adopted unanimously a resolution expressing sorlrow over the death of Mr. Dooling . It then took a recess until 7:30 in the evening . The meeting of the committee was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite news of the election of Mr. Sullivan was brought by Mr. Cruise , who shouted as he descended the stairs : " It 's Sullivan  --  unanimously . " Crowd Cheers Sullivan More than a thousand persons who crowded the reception room and corridors set up a cheer . " Hurrah for Christy ! " shouted a voice . Continued cheering followed , and there was another outburst of applause as Mr. Sullivan stepped from an elevator and walked into the leader 's office , pausing to shake hands and address by name the many who congratulated him . To the accompaniment of the popping of flashlight bulbs in the hands of a score of photographers , Mr. Sullivan , seated in the leader 's chair , gave his first interview . There was great applause from onlookers when he posed for a photograph shaking hands with Mr. Kenneally , a Hines ally . Mr. Sullivan declared that he ' proposed to " get right on the job " to win the coming election . He was asked if he expected to confer with the Democratic leaders of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the withdrawal of Senator Copeland and Mr. Whalen and the substitution of another Mayoralty candidate upon whom all five county leaders could agree . " I do not , " he replied . " I am supporting Senator Copeland . The rest of the ticket stands , too . It 's Copeland , Prial and Levy . " Mr. Sullivan said he intended to talk with those district leaders who voted against the resolution to I designate Senator Copeland to try to bring them to support of the Tammany city ticket . Not Quitting CongressAsked if he intended to continue as Representative , he replied with a smile : " I 'll discuss that later . I 'd miss that check just now . " I am going to stay xight on the job here . If my presence in Washington is required for a record vote on any important bill I will leave for Washington by train at midnight and fly back . " Questioned about the Borough President and county ticket , Mr. Sullivan said : " I have an open mind on that . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to make commitments for me . " After a little more hand shaking , Mr. Sullivan left with Mr. Standpeace and consolation which no and John T.
