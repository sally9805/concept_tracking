txt Chairman Dies of the special House committee investigating un-American activities made formal denial today of President Roosevelt 's charges yesterday in an attack on the committee 's motives and methods , and went on with the investigation . As the morning session opened twenty minutes late the chairman read what he said was a just-finished statement in reply to the President . He asserted that the inquiry had been opposed by the Administration from the start , accused Secretaries Ickes and Perkins of joining in a " well-planned campaign of misrepresentation , sarcasm and ridicule " against it , and said that " even the President was induced to repeat the silly Shirley Temple fabrication " directed at the committee . Defending the evidence received as coming from Republicans and Democrats , the chairman proposed , if the President doubted its acceptability in any court , that a committee of three lawyers be picked to pass on that question . Recounting evidence received on the Lansing " labor holiday , " he characterized it as " open and undisguised rebellion " with Governor Murphy looking on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . As Chairman Dies adjourned the committee for the day , he received and read a telegram from Homer Martin , president of the United Auto Workers of America , who was to appear tomorrow , asking to be excused from testifying . Mr. Martin wired that he ' was now engaged in " extremely delicate negotiations " to maintain peace in the motor industry this Winter . Conditions were badly strained last Winter , he asserted , because employers were maintaining labor spies , but are now much better , largely due to the positions taken by President Roosevelt and Governor Murphy . These harmonious relations , he added , might easily be jeopardized by the " opening up of old wounds " if he appeared before a body " which has unwittingly become embroiled in partisan political controversy by men who have not the truly American will for peace in our industrial democracy .

" After earlier adjournment of two hours for private examination of briefs submitted by California witnesses , Mr. Dies permitted the trio , one of whom was until lately secretary of a political association headed by the Republican candidate for Governor there , to charge that practically the entire Democratic State ticket in California is composed of Communists or close Communist allies . Harper Knowles and Ray E. Nimmo , who have been on the stand this week , had presented earlier their brief on alleged Communist political activities . It was noted that the chairman asked the witnesses if they had affidavits and other proof for all their charges , sought assurances that the Legion 's investigation had - been " absolutely nonpartisan , " and that both Republicans and Democrats had engaged in the inquiry and refused permission for quotation from a speech by Representative Clare Hoffman of Michigan , a labor critic , on the ground that a speech by a member of Congress " has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former committee policy of letting witnesses proceed largely in. their own way and with little or no crossexamination .
