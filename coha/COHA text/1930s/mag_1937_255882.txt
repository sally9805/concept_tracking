His Majesty 's Government and the whole Royal Family were busier last week than at any time since the Coronation last spring . <P> With members of the Lords and Commons gathering for the final meeting of the only Parliamentary session ever opened by King Edward VIII ( TIME , Nov. 9 , 1936 ) , and for the first meeting this week of the first Parliamentary session to be opened by King George VI , there was every reason why the Chamberlain Cabinet must score quickly a triumph of some sort , preferably in foreign affairs .

America at the present time is the only country which can afford to take risks for Peace . <P> Premier Mussolini , far from actually treading harder on Mr. Eden 's toes last week , instructed spade-bearded Italian Ambassador Dino Grandi obligingly to ease up at sessions of the London International Committee on Non-Intervention in Spain , and this enabled the British to score a " diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Thus all was set for members of His Majesty 's Government to come beaming with success to the final meeting of Edward VIII 's Parliament last week .
