SINABADA - Elinor Mordaunt - Greystone ( $2.75 ) . <P> Most autobiographies are marked by significant omissions . Elinor Mordaunt 's has at least two . The first : that Somerset Maugham once sued her for libel when she tried , in Gin and Bitters , to lay him out as he had tried to lay out Thomas Hardy in Cakes and Ale . The other gap in Author Mordaunt 's autobiography is a period of two and a half years when she was married to a Mauritian sugar planter . He was not a good husband . He put her up as a stake in a card game , tried unsuccessfully to give her away to a sea captain . Because of these interesting omissions , what is left in Sinabada is mostly travel-adventure and a long hard-luck story . <P> An ugly , fuzzy-haired , sour-tempered little tomboy born of English gentry , Author Mordaunt started life trying to keep up with her strapping brothers , one of whom was champion spitter at his school . In spite of her parents ' insistence that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting seems to fancy you , " she got herself engaged to a handsome protege of Cecil Rhodes . Soon after his sudden death in Africa , Author Mordaunt married the sugar planter-a mistake born of pity , for which she blames most of the hard luck that dogged her thereafter . <P> After her getaway from her husband , she went to Australia on a sailing vessel , gave birth to a baby shortly after her arrival . Followed a period of seven and a half years of grinding poverty , with pneumonia and a broken leg thrown in for good measure . Back in London , where a doctor prescribed " love , leisure and a balance at the bank , " she wangled a newspaper assignment to go to Jamaica , fell on deck and broke her leg again . Subsequently she had a serious operation , the flu , heart trouble , high blood pressure , another broken leg . But between mishaps she managed somehow to visit Africa and the South Sea Islands , where she won Sunday supplement fame as " Lady King " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good mixer with savages , she has been visiting them ever since . <P> Looking back on her 66-year life , Author Mordaunt does not , despite a stout attempt , make much sense of it . Nor does the reader . Most difficult to make out is the connection between her career and her comforting moral : " Never love , never pity ; keep one end in view-your own success , and all will go well with you . "
