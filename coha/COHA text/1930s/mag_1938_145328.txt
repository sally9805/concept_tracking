Up the River ( Twentieth Century-Fox ) . Bill Robinson , Preston Foster , Phyllis Brooks and Arthur Treacher in an amusing remake of a 1930 comedy satirizing 1 ) realistic prison drama , by showing a pen- itentiary which resembles a glorified country club ; 2 ) college sporting drama , by showing the bizarre doings of the Rockwell Prison football team . <P> Say It in French ( Paramount ) . Screwball comedy raised a few notches above average by the presence in the cast of three masters of offhand humor , Olympe Bradna ( Stolen Heaven ) , Ray Milland ( Three Smart Girls ) , William Collier Sr. ( Madison Square Garden , The Bride Comes Home ) .
