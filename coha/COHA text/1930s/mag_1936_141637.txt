St. Helena ( By R. C. Sherriff and Jeanne de Casalis ; Max Gordon , producer ) . This play by the author of Journey 's End presents British Actor Maurice Evans in a quiet , minutely drawn portrayal of Napoleon Bonaparte 's last years on the rocky island of St. Helena . With his handful of faithful generals , the exiled emperor arrives with a grim swagger , never doubting that he will soon be leaving as he left Elba . At once he foregoes his precious daily ride on horseback when he learns that a British guard must accompany him . But hope springs up when he reads of riots in Paris . <P> Trouble continues with the British , who tighten their watch and insist , on calling the prisoner simply General Bonaparte . <P> Napoleon makes his harassed but pompous jailer , Sir Hudson Lowe ( Percy Waram ) , wait for an interview , refuses finally to see him at all . At a birthday dinner , he wonders if he had not better died after one of his victories . The ensuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little group begins to splinter . The generals complain of pains and illness , long to be away . The faithful Corsican attendant Cipriani ( Jules Epailly ) dies . Las Cases ( Alan Wheatley ) , smugly cherishing his biographical notes , is sent away by the British - without his notes . Gourgaud ( Joseph Macaulay ) , sulking like a jealous mistress when anyone else approaches his idol , finds his lot unendurable , weeps , departs . Suffering from confinement and a bad liver , Napoleon is haunted at night by the spectres of his mistakes . He can not forget , he says , that if he had not attacked so soon at Waterloo , he would have had 12,000 more men . The imperial manners gradually give way to those of a lonely and embittered country squire . <P> Feeling death upon him at last , he hears that a comet has appeared in the sky . <P> " There was a comet when Caesar died , " he recalls . The comet turns out to be only a meteor . " We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonaparte . The play ends with Marchand reading to him from the wars of Hannibal . <P> Assembled with Producer Gordon 's customary lavishness , effectively mounted and costumed by Jo Mielziner , St. Helena naturally invites comparison with Manhattan 's other current play about a famed historical character , Victoria Regina . <P> Whereas the latter gains pace by compressing a whole career into ten scenes , Mr. Sherriff 's play loses it by stretching a single phase over eleven scenes . St. Helena is one of those plays which seems to gain stature in remembrance , with the sidelights dimmed and the details fused into a moving portrait of a crumbling conqueror , resigned but unrepentant , who clings to his destiny and keeps his iron soul to himself to the end .
