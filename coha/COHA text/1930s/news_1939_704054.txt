txt The road from Zoppot to Danzig for a distance of some ten miles was lined with police and Elite Guards this morning when Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels , the honor guest of Danzig Nazis for " German Cultural Week , " drove to the Danzig theatre to deliver his speech . Ordinary traffic was halted for two hours . Contrary to expectations , his speech to a filled house of enthusiastic supporters contained but few pointed references to Danzig . It was a eulogy of German culture and almost entirely devoted to that subject . Some 1,500 listened to the speech in the square in front of the theatre , but the day was clear , sunny and hot and many Danzigers preferred the Baltic beaches and the countryside to the stuffy cafes and restaurants in town where they were told to listen to the speech . Nazi extremists again were disappointed . The Goebbels visit , which brought to a climax a week of festivities for which thousands of Storm Troops , Elite Guards and members of the Labor Service were brought from East Prussia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a speedy return to the Reich . The city was full of " tourists " in uniform and plain clothes . The Nazis invited several thousand guests from East Prussia , but the number of Polish " tourists " was also considerable . Had the German " tourists " shown an inclination to do other than attend Nazi meetings the Polish " tourists " would have certainly manifested interest in their German opposite numbers . Around the Danzig frontiers there was increased activity among the Polish troops massed there since the end of March . Moreover , thousands of members of Polish sporting and semi-military organizations were brought from all over Poland for a mass convention  --  a replica of the Danzig show . Danzig a " German City " DANZIG , June 18 ( R ) . ? Danzig is German and " no amount of diplomacy or power politics can change this fact , " the German Propaganda Minister , Dr. Joseph Goebbels , told a cheering audience today in this Nazi-dominated Free City . Dr. Goebbels spoke for fifty-nine minutes at the closing session of Danzig 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ideas on culture , but he found occasion to weave politics into culture and to mention Danzig 's desire to return to Germany . " In these hard and tension-filled times we can depend on him ! Chancellor Hitler , " he said . " Before us stands a Reich strong and solid ; behind us stands the nation ; over us stands the Fuehrer . " Powerful means for our defense stand at our disposal . Since 1933 the German people have grown enormously in strength . Today we are a people under arms . The sword watches over the Reich . Reich Fears No Power " We need not fear any power in the world . I need not say again that the German people in its compactness stands by you and that you need have no anxiety for the fate of your city or the so-called Free State . " The State Theatre in which Dr. Goebbels spoke was packed , with brown-shirted Nazi Storm Troopers predominating . A large crowd stood outside . " Political frontiers disappear with time , but frontiers formed by blood remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Danzig I see men who I speak the German language and who uphold German culture . I feel myself on this side of the political border . " The German character of Danzig , he said , can not be a matter for parliamentary discussion , adding : " In cultural matters everything is perfectly clear . This city is in the center of political agitation , but not so in cultural matters . " Dr. Goebbels spoke after Nazi District Leader Albert Foerster told the crowd that the Propaganda Minister 's visit " means more at this time than can be pressed , because Danzig is at the center of world attention . " Turning to the Nazi Minister , Herr Foerster said : " Your speech yesterday more directly than anything that has yet happened gives us courage in this hour and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts . " Discusses Outlook on Culture This was in reference to an informal speech last night in which Dr. Goebbels said the union of Danzig with Germany was inevitable and could not be prevented by any power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a discussion of the Nazi outlook on culture , leaving politics aside for the moment . " We do not need any democratic schoolmasters for our cultural outlook , " he declared , " and we do not need to be compared with any other State . " Already , in 1933 , we cut away from Jewish influence in German art . In the last few years we have cleansed of all Jewish influence not only cultural creators but also those who receive culture . " He did not hide from his Danzig audience the economic situation of the country they seek to join . " We Germans politically and economically are under wartime leadership , " he said . " We obey only one order . Other States possess great empires and need not count every penny . " It must honestly be said that we Germans are living from hand to mouth . We are poor have-nots . " The Nazi leader spoke sarcastically of " nigger music , " saying : " We are the top-ranking music people of the world  --  with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians " mere hand workers " compared with Herr Hitler who he said was " an artist . " " Only an artist could have built the Fuehrer 's Nazi state , " he added . Held Warning to Intriguers BERLIN , June 18 GP ) . ? Nazis were quick today to interpret Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels 's Danzig speech as a new warning to " international intriguers " in general , and Poland in particular , to keep hands off the Free City issue . Germans asked with revived interest : " How and when will Chancellor Hitler move ? " That question remained unanswered but Herr Hitler 's newspaper , the Voelkischer Beobachter , observed that " all Danzig knows today that it never under no circumstances will stand alone and that it will obtain justice , come what may . " The newspaper 's heading over its comment , " Danzig Comes to Life , " was interpreted in some quarters as meaning that Germany - might soon renew pressure for the return of the Free City and for a motor road across Pomorze , the Polish Corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The official Nazi organ of Cologne , the Westdeutscher Beobachter , declared : " It is entirely unnecessary to waste words on the German right to Danzig . Danzig as a territorial province of Poland would be unbearable to the German people . " The newspaper said : " With the English blank authorization in their hands , the Poles think they can disregard the relations as they are ; never before have we seen a nation show such a catastrophic megalomania . " They do not note at all that in the meantime she , Poland has been selected as the airplane mother ship of the Western States against the Reich , just as the Benes State former Czecho-Slovakia was previously . " The newspaper , the Montag , said Danzig 's tumultous welcome to Dr. Goebbels was in effect a plebiscite that demonstrated to the world that the city wished to become a part of Germany . The outer world , said the Montag , " seeks to deny Danzig justice because to give justice would tear the web of encirclement of Germany at precisely the point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
