" The constitutionality of the TVA program , " cried he in vast relief . <P> " Do you challenge the authority of the Government to sell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By all means ! We undoubtedly do , for non-Government purposes . " <P> " Then that is your point , is n't it ? " pressed the Chief Justice . <P> " Of course it 's my point .
