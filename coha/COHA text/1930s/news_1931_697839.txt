txt New Jersey was upheld in its suit to prevent New York City from dumping garbage off the Jersey shores , but New York City shall have a " reasonable time " to construct an adequate incinerator system before the injunction takes effect , the Supreme Court ruled today in a decision from which there was no dissent . The court 's opinion followed the recent recommendations of Edward K. Campbell , special master , and in pursuance of his suggestion that a special master be named to determine the " reasonable time " for building the incinerators , Mr. Campbell himself was appointed for this task . The decision , given by Justice Butler , denied the contention of New York City that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction . Justice Butler reviewed Mr. Campbell 's report to the court and his conclusion that New York City was maintaining a " public nuisance " on the property of New Jersey , adding that " the evidence abundantly sustains the findings of fact . " New York City , Justice Butler noted , maintained that Mr. Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing incinerators . Little Diminution Shown . " The record shows that garbage gathered in the boroughs of Queens and Richmond has not been dumped at sea , " Justice Butler continued . " The quantities shown to have been so dumped were taken from the boroughs of Manhattan , Bronx and Brooklyn . " Citing tables which showed that the amount of garbage dumped at sea was almost as much in 1929 as in 1924 , he said : " Further discussion of the evidence would serve no useful purpose . It is enough to say that defendant New York City has suggested no adequate reason for disturbing the findings . They are approved and adopted by the court . " Defendant contends that , as it dumps the garbage into the ocean and not within the waters of the United States or of New Jersey , this court is without jurisdiction to grant the injunction . But the defendant is before the court and the property of plaintiff and its citizens that Is alleged to have been injured ' by such dumping is within the court 's territorial jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether within or . without the United States , is of no importance . Plaintiff seeks a decree in personam to prevent them in the future . The court has jurisdiction . " There is no merit in defendant 's contention , suggested in its amended answer , that compliance with the supervisor 's permits in respect of places designated for dumping of its garbage leaves the court without jurisdiction to grant the injunction prayed and relieves defendant in respect of the nuisance resulting from the dumping . " There is nothing in the act that purports to give to one dumping at places permitted by the supervisor immunity from liability for damage or injury thereby caused to others or to deprive one suffering injury by reason of such dumping of relief that he otherwise would be entitled to have . There is no reason why it should be given that effect . " After Mr. Campbell determines the " reasonable time , " he must , " with all convenient speed , report to the court his findings and a form of , decree . " Work on Incinerators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Supreme Court 's decision against dumping of the city 's garbage at sea , Leonard C. L. Smith , its engineering member , said yesterday that plans had already been drawn up to reduce the pollution within a comparatively short time . " We are going to get the incinerators ready and take care of this situation as quickly as we can , " he said . " They should be ready within the next two years , possibly by the end of next year . We are not surprised at the decision . We anticipated it and prepared our program accordingly . " In any event , we should have gone ahead with the plan for the disposal of garbage by incineration . Fifteen incinerators are in course of erection at a cost of $17,375,000 , exclusive of the cost of sites . Five are in Manhattan , four in the Bronx and six in Queens . " Mayor Walker said that he had not had opportunity to read the decision and would not comment on it until he had . He said he was familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation and expressed his confidence that the problem would be under satisfactory control without any unnecessary delay . While the construction of incinerators will take care of garbage disposal , the Sanitation Department recently announced a huge program to reduce harbor pollution in general . This plan looks ahead ' for the next fifty years and contemplates an expenditure of about $378,000,000 . In addition to the construction of incinerators it provides for the reduction of sewage to sludge , which may either be dumped at sea or converted into fertilizer . Incinerators and sewage disposal plants have been planned at various points about the harbor , and if the plan is adopted no more sewage will be discharged into the harbor waters . Even when this machinery is in operation sanitation engineers say that the harbor can not be thoroughly niirifiPd . The waters surrounding New York will be brought back to the condition they were about 1905 . As the first concrete step in this program contracts have already been let , for the construction of a large sewage disposal plant on Ward 's Island to serve upper Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take care of one-eighth of the sewage now discharged into the Hudson and East Rivers , and it is included as a unit in the general plan of incinerators and sewage disposal plants .
