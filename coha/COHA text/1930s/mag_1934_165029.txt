Up Capitol Hill last week marched a cohort of Birth Controllers for their annual harangue before unheeding Congressmen . At the head of the column strode Mrs. Margaret Sanger in green cloth , and Mrs. Thomas Norval Hepburn in black . <P> Mrs. Hepburn is the wife of a Hartford physician , the mother of famed Actress Katharine Hepburn , the cousin of Alanson Bigelow Houghton . An ardent worker for Causes , she once picketed the White House for suffrage . Following the well-tried formula of the past three years , Birth Controller Hepburn induced a Congressman , this time old ( 72 ) Representative Walter Marcus Pierce of Oregon , to introduce a bill exempting the medical profession from the Federal ban on the shipment of contraceptive information and material . Four times before in the last ten years had a House Committee heard arguments on similar legislation and four times before had done nothing . The fifth time promised only the same . <P> The Judiciary Committee 's big chamber lacked room for the Birth Controllers . So all paraded to the huge marble caucus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take pictures . Comely Mrs. Hepburn , like her actress daughter , objected . Her dissent provoked a vote by the Committee : for photographs , eight ; against , three . Mrs. Hepburn disappeared during the picture taking . <P> With a gallery of special-interests and hangers-on breathing heavily , Mrs. Hepburn started the show by attempting to anticipate Congressional skepticism and Roman Catholic slurs . " We are not connected , " she insisted , " with any commercial interest We are here because Mrs. Sanger in her nursing experience of 20 years became convinced that Birth Control was necessary for the welfare of women . . . . Race suicide talk is just as ridiculous as was that of those who said , when we women wanted the vote , that it would destroy the home . " <P> Mrs. Sanger. slim and tense , recited her old piece to the glum , fidgeting Committeemen : " The forgotten woman can have her child 's teeth and adenoids cared for at clinics . She can send her children to get free luncheons . She can do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little riot developed when Religion 's spokesman for Birth Control , Rabbi Edward L. Israel of Baltimore , exclaimed : " If you members of the Committee think birth control is immoral , then pass a law that will drive contraceptives out of every home in the nation . " <P> Up hopped Committeeman John Camillus Lehr of Monroe . Mich. , to shout : " I want it to appear on the Committee 's record that there has never been a contraceptive in my home . I have six children . " <P> Representative Pierce : " I also have six children . " Mrs. Hepburn : ' ' I also have six children . " <P> Rev. Charles Edward Coughlin , radiorator of Detroit 's Shrine of the Little Flower , utterly antagonistic to Mrs. Sanger 's movement , brought down the house : " The Negroes are out-begetting the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic races in this country . So are the Poles . . . . Distribution is what we need . There are n't enough hungry mouths in this country to consume the wheat we raise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! boo-oo-ooh ! " <P> Father Coughlin : " I 'll take care of them over the radio . "
