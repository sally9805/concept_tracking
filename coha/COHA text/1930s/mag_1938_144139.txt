When Runner Glenn Cunningham first made sport headlines in 1931 , the world 's record for a mile on foot was 4 min. , 9.2 sec . A 4:05 mile was unthinkable . <P> Last week barrel-chested Glenn Cunningham , now 28 , and the father of a nine-months old daughter , went to Hanover , N. H. with the express purpose of running a 4:05 mile on Dartmouth 's fast board track . This deliberate move was not wholly undramatic . The world 's record of 4:06.4 , set by England 's Stanley Wooderson last summer , had been officially recognized by the International Amateur Athletic Federation just three days before . <P> Paced by six Dartmouth runners , with handicaps ranging from five to 600 yards , Cunningham ran his race almost exactly as he planned : the quarter mile in 58.5 sec. , the half mile in 2:02.5 , the three-quarter mile in 3:04.2 and-pumping his piston-like legs as fast as he could-the mile in 4:04.4 . <P> Not only did his amazing performance establish Glenn Cunningham as the fastest miler in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent . Only 18 times in foot-racing history has a man run a mile under 4:10- the dividing line between milers and super milers . Superman Cunningham did it last week for the eighth time . Track experts predicted that Cunningham will do a 4:03 mile .
