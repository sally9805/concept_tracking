C LIVEDEN SET ? There is no such thing ! It is a fantastic invention . It has no existence . I t , never did exist . So Lady Astor received the suggestion that she should discuss the sensational stories about the " Cliveden Set " which have gone round the world . Yes , I know this tale of the Three Black Crows has been printed in America and all over the Empire . I get letters from hundreds of people I 've never seen  --  from Australia , Canada , Hong Kong  --  everywhere . They call me Nazi , pro-Fascist , traitor , and worse ! This is what they say : That my family and friends ought all to be taken out and shot ! That I 'm the center of a vicious and degenerate gang which , in some mysterious fashion , has got control of England 's foreign policy , and uses it . to keep tight hold of their own fortunes , at the expense of England 's honor and to the destruction of the Jews . It puts Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing that all this mischievous rubbish should have grown out of a false and stupid story published in a Communist rag a little more than a year ago . Alt this vicious violence  --  it originated in a perfectly untrue statement about a week-end party in October , 1937 . They said Lord Halifax 's visit to Berlin was planned then , and that it caused Mr. Eden to threaten to resign . Tho truth was that the government had already arranged to send Lord Halifax to Berlin , and Mr. Eden himself  --  and not Lord Halifax  --  was our guest at Clive-den at that week end . There was , too , the notorious party supposed to have been held at Cliveden in January , 1938 . Here it was that the wire-pulling took place which led to Mr. Eden 's resignation in February . Among the plotters assembled to do this dark deed , if you believe the Communists , were Lord Astor and I , the Prime Minister , Lord Halifax and Lord Lothian . The easily demonstrable truth is , believe it or not , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , Florida , Lord Lothian was in India , and wherever the Prime Minister and Lord Halifax were , it was not at Cliveden , because the house was closed . There was no one at Cliveden , nor is there any other possible foundation for the legend . The whole monstrous tale was fabricated by the Communists from nothing and copied by writers for whom fiction always is stranger than fact . Of course , I do n't mind anybody knowing about my home life . Heaven knows , it 's public enough . That 's one of the penalties of public life . Your private life is also public . But mine is a mixture . My public life is really very homelike and my private life is really very publiclike . I want to help those people who hate to think the story is true and wish it was n't . I should like to show them what our home here , or in Loudon , really is like , what the entertaining we do really means , and get them to understand it . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Virginian . My father entertained , and his father before him . We carry out Saint Paul 's instructions . We Virginians show hospitality no matter where we be . No , we do not entertain with any plan or plot . With a purpose , yes , for our life has a purpose ; but not a plot or plan . I am too impulsive to plot or even to plan long ahead . Naturally , we entertain politicians , and politicians include peers and paupers . But they are only some of the guests . They 're mixed up with Labor men , social workers , writers , our TEE SATURDRY EVENING POST American friends , religious teachers , temperance workers  --  all sorts . We 're deeply interested in social reforms . We 're democrats in the widest . sense . I 'm not a Communist ; I 'm not a Nazi ; I 'm not a Fascist . I 'm a passionate believer in democracy . I believe the world moves on by putting together all kinds of honest minds . The object of our parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to get together and hear one another 's views . My husband and I have worked rather hard in public and private life for social reforms . We believe in reforms and not in revolutions ; reforms last longer and leave fewer scars . We 're not built on party lines , and reformers are few in any party . My husband went against his party when he voted for Lloyd George 's health insurance , and la ter when he advocated state control of the liquor interests and exposed the political and social ramifications of the trade . We March 4 , 1030 lems between members of all parties and none . try here to get exchanges of opinion on social prob- Realize that , and then think of the charge that we , I of all people , have a vulgar desire to keep the aristocrats on top I My husband 's work in the House of Commons , in which he was passionately interested , ceased when his father died and he succeeded to the title and had to go to the House of Lords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of becoming a viscount and continue his work in the Commons . He even drafted and brought in a bill to enable the eldest sons of peers to escape succeeding their fathers if they wanted to . He was a very sad man when he failed to get it passed into law . That was twenty years ago . 1 took my husband 's seat in the House of Commons , and they said it was a historical occasion . The first woman in the Mother of Parliaments was a Virginian . Now I am almost an ancient monument , but I am still a Virginian , and still a democrat and an ardent believer in women 's rights and social reforms . Well , how on earth could such a combination as that believe in Musso lini , or Hitler , or Stalin , or in any dic 57i tator ? May I say that for certain columnists to write columns of invented nonsense about people whom they have never spoken to , seems to me to be carrying freedom to dangerous lengths . Patrick Henry spoke my sentiments some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or give me death " ; but I do n't believe that he meant this kind of liberty . We both believe that the only true system of freedom is the democratic one , and that real democracies must include women voters as well as men . How anyone who is a feminist and has seen the effect of the women 's interest upon public affairs could believe in dictators , I ca n't conceive . This Communist lie has gone all over the world . It shows how easy it is , when you have a world-wide organization , to get a lie around quickly . Some of the columnists have implied that my objection to Communism is that this creed threatens wealth . Nothing of the sort ! Communism denies God and religion . It breaks up the family . These , to my mind , are the fundamental crimes of Communism . That 's why I have fought it as a political faith . The English Credo B UT this lie has been sent out not as ostensible Communist propaganda . Oh , no , the Communists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in the name of democracy . Communism and democracy are as ill bedfellows as Fascism and freedom . Neither of these can go together . They just wo n't mix . I want to dispel this outrageous fiction of a Cliveden Set maneuvering for political power , dispel the idea that we are pro-Nazi , or pro-Fascist , or anti-Jew , We believe in the traditional liberty and the sense of fair play which are the basis of the democratic creed and make England the mother of modern democracy . I am grateful for having been born into the English way of thinking , which , to my mind , spells political and religious freedom . If freedom survives in this distraught world , it will survive because of this way of thinking . Political and religious freedom was born here in England ; if it dies here , it may die even in western lands . But I do n't believe for a moment that any of the creeds which deny freedom  --  Marxism , How vividly it all comes back ! The doctor , himself fatigued , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Mr. Wilson 's room , finding him seated with his head bowed , deeply depressed . I asked if he felt badly . He said wearily : " I always feel badly now , little girl , and somehow I hate to have Grayson leave . " I said : " He is still downstairs . Let me run and tell him , and he will stay . " Woodrow caught my hand to ' stay me . " No , that would he a selfish thing on my part . Ho is not well himself and needs the change . " Then he added , slowly : " It wo n't be very much longer , and I had hoped he would not desert me ; but that I should not say , even to you . " Though the words were like an echo of the death knell that had already sounded in my own heart , I set myself to divert and cheer him . Mr. Wilson spent a restless evening on January twenty-ninth . At one A.M. ? January thirtieth  --  he was not asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About that time Scott readjusted our patient 's pillows and he dozed off . On waking after daybreak . he did not leave his room , but had Randolph bring his Communism , Nazism , Fascism  --  I do n't believe they can ever grow in countries that have this way of thinking . We think for ourselves . We refuse to put our thinking out . We will be led , but not bullied . As to anti-Semitism  --  why , long before most people had heard of Zionism , we were getting Doctor Weizmann to meet Mr. Arthur Balfour at our house . We certainly had but one idea in that  --  to help the Jews . Yet I believe I am described now not only as a Hitlerite , but as a violent anti-Jew . Is it . not right to call the fiction outrageous ? How deeply Cliveden must have compromised Will Rogers ! He was a frequent guest at Cliveden , and a much-honored one . He arrived one day with a note from my brother-in-law , Dana Gibson . I realized at once that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He met peers and poets at our home , and his meeting with J. M. Barrie was not only a high spot in his life but a high spot in Barrio 's life . We dined and talked  --  at least Will Rogers talked and we laughed  --  until one o'clock . Then this remarkable incident occurred . Barrie walked Will Rogers back to his flat , and there , at Adelphi Terrace , they talked until dawn . That did n't often happen to Barrie . Will Rogers ' humor was just what people here like . It made a good , honest thing better , but it punctured sham things . How he loved to prick a bubble with some sharp little wisecrack , and how wo loved him to do it , and how we miss him . Como and look at the Cliveden Visitor 's Book , which everybody signs . Then you 'll see what the Cliveden Sets are . They 're all there , or nearly all , except the visitors for a day , like the Rhodes scholars , who have been deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have met politicians of all sorts and conditions , writers and artists . I can show you a photograph of Bernard mail , to which he dictated no answers , only indicating the replies my brother should make . On his table lay , unsigned , lettere dictated on other days . By nigh tfall he was very ill . I called in Doctors Ruffin and Fowler . The next day , when Doctor Grayson reached the bedside , there seemed little hope . We sent for Margaret and Nell . Jessie was in Siam . My dear one lay in a stupor , but when I would leave the room for a moment and return , he would lift his hand to take mine . Night succeeded day , and the day the night , the hours ticking on unheeded . Thus passed Friday and Saturday , the first and second of February . The nights were chill , but throughout them both knots of men and women remained in the street . Sunday , February third , dawned radiant and beautiful . While church bells called people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and praying , the frail body which had been racked with pain for so many years relaxed , and the enduring spirit took its flight . The peace which passeth all understanding had come to Woodrow Wilson . Editorin Note  --  Thin in the Lent of a aeries of arbolca by Mrs. WilsonShaw receiving them . That 's a Clive-den Set with a purpose  --  that they should meet people like Bernard Shaw . Not sinister enough ? Well , here 's another . Do you remember when Krassin was sent to England by the Soviet. ? E. F. Wise , an Englishman who represented certain Russian interests in Britain , happened to he a friend of my husband . He told us that Krassin was eager to see some financiers , and that he understood Sir Ernest Cassell was willing to meet him under a neutral roof . Would we have them both to meet ? Remember , this was in the days when people in England felt as strongly about Bolshevik persecutions and massacres in Russia as they do now about what 's going on in Germany . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luncheon it was . Krassin , Sir Ernest Cassell , Lord Robert Cecil and Joe Devlin . How Joe Devlin got there , I ca n't remember ; lie must have been coming anyhow . He was an Irish Nationalist M.P. , a real orator and a great friend . He leaned over and whispered in my ear , one night when I was making a speech in the House , " I do n't know what you are going to say , but I am here to back you . " So at our house Krassin met his capitalist . We entertained Krassin not because we sympathized with Communists but because I sympathized with the starving children in Russia . Sokolni koff , too , when Soviet ambassador to England , often came . Be was intensely interesting . He had accompanied Lenin on his entry into Russia , in disguise , to overthrow Kerensky . Some time ago ? Yes , certainly . But typical . It would be better called a Kremlin Set than a Cliveden Set , would it not ? There are dozens of instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What it all means is that we like people with every kind of honest thought to meet here , whether they 're Russians , Jews , Americans , Germans or British . // We are horrified by all the persecutions in Germany , Russia and Italy , so it 's galling to be described as pro-dictator . My father once said in despair that I respected nothing but goodness  --  and this brings me to Gandhi . He came several times to St. James 's Square , and he mot strange company , including a crown prince who is as good as Gandhi . Those two had much in common . He also met Charlie Chaplin , but they did n't seem to click . This does n't mean that I personally agreed either with Charlie Chaplin 's belief in Douglas credit or with Gandhi 's civil disobedience . But I liked both men . There is another example . I had a little Cliveden Set all by myself with Lawrence of Arabia , when , as Air-craftsman Shaw , he was stationed near Plymouth . There was nothing political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives would have made certain I bad turned pro-Arab ! I loved the joy of his companionship and it was one of the high spots of my life when he took me off pillion riding on his motor bicycle  --  especially as my husband came round the corner unexpectedly and saw us start off like that through my constituency . Lawrence escaped being " compromised by Cliveden . " But now our friendship with Lindbergh is being turned into a political intrigue , and that really makes me angry . No one thought of it till this Cliveden-Set myth started . One of the things I 'll never forget is the first time we met Lindbergh . It was after his great Atlantic flight , and we took him down to the House of Commons . I knew the members would give him a warm welcome , but their real emotion at . meeting him showed , too , and surprised us all . Lindbergh has never changed . Few heroes have borne themselves so heroically . His whole life and work is an epic of heroism . No plot could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father-in-law , Dwight Morrow , later on became one of my heroes . I do n't believe my Virginian friends thought it sinister that a Yankee Republican should become a Southern Democrat 's hero . Dwight Morrow met General Smuts at our house ; they came to have a brief chat and talked rem . hours . Names In Our Guest Book Ordinary entertaining ? Yes , of course , it is . And there is nothing else at Cliveden . My brother-in-law owns The Times ? He does , and my husband owns The Observer . Most newspapers have to have owners . Lord Halifax comes to see us ? He does ; he was at school and college with my husband . So have Emma Goldman visited Cliveden , and Walter Page , and Hoover , and Ramsay MacDonald , and Philip Snowden , and Anthony Eden . Even Franklin D. Roosevelt was compromised ; he once helped us cut the grass when Cliveden was a war hospital . Gen. Evangeline Booth is in the Cliveden Set up to the neck . She often comes to our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as women members of Parliament . She might meet politicians from all parties , but I doubt if she has ever met plotters of the Right or Left . Our friends do n't plot ; they talk openly and freely . Last spring , on his return from Florida , my husband asked the Prime Minister to come to lunch to meet some American journalists . An awful lot of nonsense wits talked about that . He was accused of trying to put a pro-Hitler policy across ! Nobody who knew the American journalists would have thought of that . The reason for that party was that we wanted the American newspapermen to meet Neville Chamberlain , whom they did not know . Surely there 's nothing sinister in getting pressmen acquainted with leading politicians . We 've done it for Lloyd George and Ramsay MacDonald in the past . ' What opinions these premiers hold is not so much my concern as the fact that they ought to be helped to meet responsible newspapermen. . /Is Others See Us The only sots of ' people that have come regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group to think out a ten-year edueal ional plan for children , another group on nursery schools , another on temperance reform , and several groups on agricultural policy- . My husband has long been interested in this , and his groups have published several books . But I do n't know how I can hope to convince people who want to believe in traitors and wire-pullers , and like to think things are managed by backstairs influence . The very latest version of the myth contained in an American paper purports to set out the names of twelve leading members of the Cliveden Set . Of these twelve , there are five whom I do n't know at all . There are four others whom I know slightly , two of whom have never entered my home . The remaining three include my husband and myself . The thing has its humors . I have before me a French newspaper cutting with a. charming word picture of a Cliveden party . All about Mr. Neville Chamberlain with three fishing rods and a pair of guns , our two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five horses , most of which have run in the Derby , at the disposal of the guests . And a Canadian newspaper 's comment : " This picture of Lady Astor sending her collected ambassadors , statesmen and bankers out riding on Derby graduates is a very beautiful one . " Writers of humor and common sense balance this nonsense . One well-known wit , in a London daily , described how two visitors were reported to have arrived at . Cliveden at dead of night up the River Thames in a battle cruiser flying the Swedish flag , and everyone in the neighborhood believed that the two mysterious visitors were Miss Garbo and Mr. Stokowski . Only later did it transpire that they were Hitler and Mussolini . I have met only two dictators , Stalin and Ataturk . I was far from expecting to meet Stalin when I went to Russia , but he wanted to see Bernard Shaw , who was in our party . I remember that we talked of Great Britain , and how strange it was that such a small island governed one third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of it was the British character . " Look at the map , " I said . " It ca n't be might ; it must be right . It 's something in their thinking . " We also saw Krupskaya , Lenin 's widow . In connection with the Russian fraternization , I got into hot water with my political caucus and Conservative supporters in Plymouth for wanting to have a trade agreement with the Soviet , and being photographed out there with Radek and Lunacharsky. // ( Continued from Pogo 76 ) I had a good deal of admiration for the other dictator , Ataturk . I met him when attending an international conference of women at Istanbul . People of ten have teased me about my admiration for Ataturk ; they did n't see what he was striving to do . He was trying to get Turkey ready for a democratic form of government , though he knew it could not come in his day . The fine thing about him was his genuine admiration for the democratic system of government . He was the only dictator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His whole purpose was to lead his people toward democracy . He also realized that Turkish women must play their part in the nation 's life . Being a dictator , he could , and did , free them with a stroke of the pen . He is a great loss to Turkey and Europe . Yes , it is quite true that I am a supporter of Chamberlain . Why should n't I be Chamberlain is a complete contrast to the dictators . There 's nothing spectacular about what he says and does , and he makes few promises , and only when he sees a way to keep them ; and he 's a first-class administrator , and a real progressive social reformer . I was an admirer of Neville Chamberlain long before the public heard much of him ; I saw his work in the House of Commons when he was Minister of Health . I liked his tidy mind . It was he who gave us the scheme of widows ' pensions , and broke up the old poor law and gave us a sound scheme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed the lives of the children the state has to look after . Anyone who knows anything about health and housing will tell you that , for knowledge of the problems and wisdom in solving them , there 's no one can beat Neville Chamberlain . That is domestic , not foreign policy ? Surely . But no man is going to be wise in international affairs if he 's unwise in internal affairs . A Word About Munich I backed up Chamberlain in trying to get appeasement in Europe . Make no mistake . If we do n't get appeasement , we shall get war . I think he has been right to make a serious attempt to reach an understanding , even with the countries whose internal policies are different from our own , and in pushing on with rearmament at the same time . A word about Munich . Some are not proud of the whole of this settlement . But Munich was neither a deliberate betrayal of democracy nor a pusillanimous sellout to a bluffer . Since September , oven our Left newspapers have discovered that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Britain was short of antiaircraft guns . Soviet Russia , being separated from Czechoslovakia by the intervening territories of Poland and Rumania , could not get an army there quickly . Germany had her troops concentrated on the exposed Austrian frontier of Czechoslovakia . These military facts may explain why Daladier and Chamberlain tried to save at least some of Czechoslovakia by mi.se , and the world from a bloody war . Might Makes Fright Munich has made me realize that firmness in foreign policy is impossible unless backed up by adequate force . Mouth fighting does not frighten dictators . Mr. Chamberlain may fail in reaching an understanding . But , I repeat , this hope for peace and understanding does not mean that I 'm a Fascist . In this country , and in America , we are all free to hold our own opinions , and long may we be free to do so . The last word about the silly Cliveden-Set myth , so untrue and unfair : Long before the war a group of young and brilliant men were intimate friends of ours . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to work out the union . We opened house to them and many times gave hospitality to groups from the dominions and colonies who were in - England for consultation and conference . They were called " The Round Table " ? they gave their name to the quarterly they ran . Among them were Lionel Curtis , Philip Kerr  --  now Lord Lothian , and Secretary of the Rhodes Trust  --  Geoffrey Dawson  --  now editor of The London Times  --  Robert Brand  --  my brother-in-law  --  Lionel Hichens and Alfred Zimmern . That was twenty-five years ago . Most of them married , and marriage is ruination for groups . The fact that these young men later in life became bankers , or directors of big firms , or editors does not mean that today I am in the pocket of international bankers , or that I direct the policy of their newspapers . I often wish that I did . My compatriots must have lost their sense of the ridiculous if they swallow this nonsense about my directing cabinet policy and exercising more power than Queen Elizabeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
