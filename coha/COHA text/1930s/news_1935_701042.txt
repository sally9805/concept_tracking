txt l'or forty years Kenneth McCalltan , who is now 72 and silvery of hair , has been developing a philosophy of life . It is eminently simple . " I go along until I get hungry , " he said yesterday , " and then I steal a pair of pants . " Ile was sitting in the detective bureau , where he had been taken after store detectives seized him as he was leavings Sears , Roebuck &; Co. with two pairs of his favorite loot , valued at $9.96 , plus sales tax . His record had been looked up , and it showed that he had been arrested in New York , Detroit , ' Cleveland , Pittsburgh , St. Louis , and Chicago almost an in. finite number of times , and always for purloining pants . Ashamed ? Not He . " There is nothing to apologize for in my caree ? , " he asserted . " I in. vented it , and it gives me a living . I never stole anything but pants in my life . Coats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But pants ! Ah , my boy , half the world needs and must have them . You can sell ' em anywhere , if I had a thousand pairs I could walk into offices In the loop and get rid of them in a few days . " " But does n't your conscience hurt You ? " lie was asked . " No , " said the pioneer pants stealer , " I ca n't say that it does . MY operations help clothe people who would n't be able to pay the regular prices . A Noble Calling , Indeed . " Putting pants on the public seems to me to be a worthy calling . If I go to the BridewelII woik in the kltchen and get plenty to cat . And l'stay off the relief . " " After this , though , you 'll probably reform , " his questioner suggested : Kenneth McCallum shook his : guy head . " No , " he replied , " 1 guess not ... We all have to eat , and you - know the saying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out again I 'll go hack east and steal some pants . "
