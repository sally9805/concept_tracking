Twenty-six years ago Louis Eckstein , rich Chicago merchant and real-estate operator , began sponsoring summer music in Ravinia Park , 37 acres of woodland which he owned on Chicago 's North Shore . Depression interrupted the concerts in 1932 and Patron Eckstein died in 1935 before they were resumed . When his widow agreed to let Ravinia be used for summer music again , 25 businessmen raised $30,000 and reopened Ravinia last summer ( TIME , July 13 ) . Back to Chicago last week went Lucrezia Bori , Leon Rothier and Mario Chamlee ( Archer Ragland Cholmondeley ) who had helped make Ravinia opera nationally known . Day of the opening , Chamlee developed laryngitis , had to be replaced by Tenor Armand Tokatyan who in turn had to be replaced by Rolf Gerard at the Cincinnati Zoo where he was scheduled to appear . In honor of Patron Eckstein , Miss Bori gave her services free . Old Gennaro Papi , a longtime Ravinia favorite , postponed his European trip so he could conduct the Chicago Orchestra . After the opening night , Sir Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other conductors scheduled : Swiss Ernest Ansermet , Hans Kindler of Washington 's National Symphony , Hans Lange , St. Louis ' Vladimir Golschmann , Cincinnati 's Fritz Reiner . On July 17 at Ravinia , Mischa Mischakoff , recently made concertmaster of the NBC Orchestra ( TIME , May 10 ) , will play his last for Chicago . <P> Rain deferred the opening of the Detroit Symphony 's free concerts on Belle Isle . When the series finally began last week the temperature fell to nearly a record low for July . Nevertheless , 1,500 people stayed for a concert of Mendelssohn , Saint-Sans , Leoncavallo , Lehar . Because donors had provided about $35,000 , Manager Murray Gordon Paterson was able to promise a full six-week season , running every night but Monday . Hungarian Victor Kolar , associated with the Detroit Symphony since 1919 , was newly back from Europe and planned to conduct the whole series . At a later concert he planned to make the 1812 Overture louder than Tchaikovsky intended by setting off time-bombs instead of cannon . <P> The summer sun beat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman who , whirling to the strains of a sweating , shirtsleeved orchestra , sang and danced passionately around a plaster head on a property platter until her feet hurt and print dress was damp and dusty . She was Erica Darbo , the Scandinavian soprano whose U. S. debut set Cincinnati agog last February in Strauss ' Salome , rehearsing for her first New York appearance . The night of the performance , in costume and against a background of stars and sultry violet , Miss Darbo gained full credit for the force and fury of her acting , but New Yorkers were not impressed with her wiry , imperfect voice , scarcely at its best in the open air . They thought her dance of the Seven Veils more realistic than graceful . Ivan Ivantzoff was more secure as cowardly King Herod . Conductor Alexander Smallens made the score taut and exciting , shared honors with Stage Director Ernst Lert who has produced creditable Salomes at Freiburg , Leipzig , Frankfurt , Basle , Milan . Manhattan applauded the ingenuity with which Lert changed the Stadium platform into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Edmond Dulac .
