Last week a lieutenant from Randolph Field , the Army Air Corps training centre in Texas , missed the town at which he was instructed to land on a cross-country flight . He turned up with a novel excuse . Said he : his navigation was so accurate that he passed directly over the town , was so intent on scanning the terrain on both sides of his course that he never noticed it .
