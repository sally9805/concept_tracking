Does it apply to my business . After reading volumes and listening to hundreds of opinions , I am still definitely confused . I manufacture upholstered chairs . I have ceased shipping interState . I get most of my raw materials from out of State , such as lumber , fabrics , springs , tacks , etc . Does the fact that getting my materials through interState Commerce make me subject to this act even if I do n't ship interState ? <P> I wrote Mr. Andrews several weeks ago , but so far , no answer .
