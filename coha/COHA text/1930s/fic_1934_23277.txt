illiweitrrowto0 14,11111P . NATURAL ENOUGH A STORY BY SUSAN ERTZ " W HAT on earth are you going to do about him ? " Mrs. Blythe asked . She was resting on the couch in her bedroom , her big , solidly built body , which yet tired so easily , covered with a peach-colored silk eiderdown , while silk cushions of varying shades swelled plumply under her head . The room might have been designed for a Pompadour , so rich was it in brocades and silks and mirrors and silver , and it enabled Mrs. Blythe 's heavy , homely face to look triumphantly out of place . But though she contrasted so oddly with these extravagant , feminine , eighteenth-century surroundings , she conquered this discordance by her sturdy genuineness and by her complete unconsciousness of self . She lay looking with a half-humorous , half-grudging affection at Louise , about to go home , who was carefully wriggling her small fingers into a pair of tight , black kid gloves . " I will see first what he is like , " said Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entirely unruffled , and as she sat there , severely neat , she was as out of place in that room as Mrs. Blythe herself . Her small , pointed face looked precisely as usual , her becoming , fashionable little hat was perched , as always , on her smoothly brushed hair , and even the familiar white imitation gardenia was in its accustomed place on the collar . " Yes , but after that ? " persisted Mrs. Blythe . " And after that and after that ? " she wanted to ask , to satisfy her greedy interest . She was an ogress , a kind ogress , for news . She wanted to hear everything , everything . She frankly wanted to poke and pry , and in her friendly , sympathetic curiosity squeeze out the whole truth about this astonishing situation . These things , naturally , did n't happen to oneself . How then was one to know about them unless one asked and asked ? " After that , I do n't quite know yet , " said Louise . That extraordinary calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because she was a Frenchwoman . Some Frenchwomen would have been excited , hysterical , voluble . No , but it was because she was a certain type of Frenchwoman  --  the quiet , matter-of-fact , fatalistic sort . And a very perfect specimen of the type besides . Even so , her quiet acceptance of this thing was astounding . " But how can you keep so calm ? I 'd be nearly out of my mind with worry . I think that in a way it 's the most awful situation I ever heard of . " " It is interesting , " said Louise , thoughtfully . " Interestingl " Really , thought Mrs. Blythe , could any word be more in-adequate ? " One must take things as they come in this life . I will give the children their lessons this week as usual . After that , I do n't know . " " Of course , " said Mrs. Blythe , " I do n't want to stand in the way of your happiness ; but how can you be sure ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be throwing away . You 're making quite a good living now . You 're perfectly free and independent . You 've made good connections . . . " " Grdce a vous , madame , " said Louise quietly . " Part of it was due to me , I admit , but you 've got a way with you , Louise . People like you . You 'd better stay Just dig your toes in and say you wo n't go . Surely he ca n't make you . " " No one can make me go to Australia or any other place if I do n't wish , " said Louise , smoothing the thumb of her glove . " Well then , " said Mrs. Blythe . " On the other hand , " Louise went on , " I do not find it amusing , living alone . " Mrs. Blythe was startled by this intrusion of a fundamental need and faintly annoyed . " If that is n't just like a Frenchwomanl " she exclaimed . " Really , you shock me , Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " " I am sorry , madame , but surely it is natural . Men and women should live together . It was doubtless intended by the good God . " Mrs. Blythe wondered , for a fleeting second , if it was by the Divine Intention that she herself occupied that large , satiny apartment and Mr. Blythe its slightly more masculine counterpart on the far side of the bathroom . " That dreadful French logic of yours , " she said , returning quickly to the business in hand . " I hardly know what to say to you . But in spite of all you 've done , in spite of the hideous mess you got yourself into , I 'm convinced you 're a thoroughly nice woman , and I 'll never forget what you 've done for Roland and Catherine . I 'm really very fond of you , Louise . " " I am very fond indeed of you , madame , " said Louise , with decorous warmth , " and I love Roland and Catherine next to my own son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely it was natural enough . I was an ignorant , neglected young girl . I had no mother . My father forgot me most of the day only to remember me with annoyance . You can not expect the wisdom and prudence of forty on the shoulders of seventeen . But even when all that is admitted , I have my son . In ten years , when I am not quite forty-three , he will be twenty-five , Think , what happiness for me then to have a fine son who is already a man of the world . It is true I have suffered much for him , but all that is now behind me , and doubtless my love is all the greater for it . " " I do n't know where you get so much philosophy , at your age , " said Mrs. Blythe , in half-unwilling admiration . " What was the young man like ? Ca n't you remember him at all ? You 've told me very little , you know . " " I saw him twice only , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first time he was sober . The second time he had been drinking . Not badly , but a little . He was doubtless like many other young men . He could be chivalrous if it did not cost him too much . He was on leave and was spending a few days in Paris . Wishing for a little excursion , he took a boat down the Seine to Mantes , and so came to the aubcrge kept by my father . He saw me first in the garden , with the baby in my arms . I was crying . When he heard my story ? " " What did you tell him ? " Mrs. Blythe asked . " But the truth , naturally . That I was engaged to a young soldier who , at eighteen , had just been called to his regiment . It was in the last year of the War . I told him what I told you , madame , that we had anticipated our marriage , and so suddenly was he sent for that there was no time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my baby when it was born had no father . My own father was very angry , for now he had two on his hands , and the crying of the child was an added irritation . He worked hard only to have leisure to read , and he read Voltaire and Rousseau and Diderot . He cared nothing for his family ; only mankind existed for him . It is a type . So when the young man heard my story he was sorry for me . He himself had had a serious disappointment . He had been engaged to a young English girl , but she had married his best friend instead . " " So he was feeling reckless , I suppose , " said Mrs. Blythe . " He said he did not care what happened to him . He offered to marry me and leave the same day . I should then if he were killed , as he expected to be , receive his pension . Also my child would have a name . My father was pleased , and so it was done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him since . " " Well , but then after he left , " prompted Mrs. Blythe . " Then a kind English lady who sometimes stayed at the auberge , brought me to England to live with her for a while . She taught me English , and I taught her and her friends to speak French . Soon I took a room and with my teaching kept my child and myself . Now fifteen years have passed since my marriage , and I have not heard one word . Suddenly my husband returns from Australia , goes to Mantes to see my father , and gets my address from him . To-morrow he comes to London to ask me to return with him to Australia and to livewith him as his wife . I do not say 1 am not a little troubled . That is natural enough . But I must decide what it is best to do for the sake of my son . " " It 's an extraordinary situation , " said Mrs. Blythe . " It is curious , but doubtless not unique , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts were busy with her own life . One married , oneself , after the marriage had been carefully considered and approved of by one 's family . Then , after a conventional honeymoon in the Lake District , one settled down to housekeeping and children , moving as the years passed from one comfortable house to another more comfortable . One 's husband increased in girth and wealth , and one soon gave up the struggle to preserve one 's figure . What contrasts life could and did embrace ! " I shall miss you dreadfully if you do go , " she said , her thoughts winging back again , " and Roland and Catherine will he inconsolable . But , as you say , you must think of yourself and your son . How do you imagine you 'd like living in Australia ? " " I find one place very like another , " said Louise , with composure . " And even in Australia I can doubtless continue my French lessons . My method , / believe , is superior to other methods , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But your friends ? " said Mrs. Blythe . " Ab , that is different . To leave you and the children and a few others to whom I have become attached , that is a real grief . Now I must go , madame . Louis will have returned from school and will want his supper . " Mrs. Blythe held out her hand . " Good-by , Louise . I 'll be thinking of you . It seems to me a ghastly situation , but I suppose you 'll deal with it in your own way . We 'll expect you the day after to-morrow then , and I hope I sha n't hear that it 's for the last time . " Louise went down the stairs with her usual quiet dignity , and along the hail to the front door , her small heels tapping the marble floor of the vestibule . Lawson , the head parlor-maid , heard her , and came hurrying to let her out . Louise was a great favorite in the house , and Lawson always liked a word with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Williams . Nasty day for walking , I 'm afraid . Its horrid and wet underfoot too . if Crawford was here he 'd give you a lift as far as the bus , I 'm sure , but he is n't back yet from taking the children to their grandmother 's . " " Never mind , Lawson . I have my umbrella , " said Louise , taking it from the stand . " I would rather ride than walk , that is natural enough , but it is better that I take exercise , even though it is raining a little . " " And how is the boy ? " asked Lawson . " Back in school again , I hope , after that bad cold he had . " " Quite well again , thank you . It is kind of you , Lawson , to remember . " She walked briskly away toward Oxford Street , and so vanished , temporarily , from the lives of the Blythe family in their comfortable house in Bryanston Square . After some delay she succeeded in boarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit , shop-infested length of the Edgware Road . When she reached the far end of it , a five minutes ' walk brought her to a new block of flats whose square , dark bulk was pierced by lighted windows . After climbing three flights of stairs she opened a door marked Number IS . She had acquired this flat at a considerably lower rental as , by some ironic coincidence , there had already been a death from illness there and a suicide . Louise , not being superstitious , cared nothing for this , but regarded it rather as a fortunate circumstance . It was sad that such things happened , but happen they did , and if someone were able , indirectly , to profit by them , so much the better for them . She closed the door and called , " Louis ! Louis ! Here I am . Now we will have supper at once . " A dark , handsome boy of fifteen or so came down the passage to meet her . He kissed her affectionately and said in French , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup on to heat , I have lighted the fire , I have done everything but make the omelette . " " Speak English , speak English then ! " his mother said . She took off her hat and coat and changed her shoes in a tiny bedroom that was almost completely occupied by a large , old-fashioned double bed , the only piece of furniture the flat contained that had come with her from Mantes . After putting her things neatly away , she washed her hands and went to join her son . The whole flat was in perfect order and shone with cleanliness . In the one small living room a table was laid for two and a fire was burning . The curtains and chair-covers were all of washable material , and had been made  --  and recently washed  --  by Louise herself . She gave the room a quick survey and then pointed to her son 's schoolbooks which were lying , still in their leather straps , on the sofa . " Oh , bother ! " said the boy , in English this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black mark , I suppose . " " I do n't expect you to be quite perfect , " his mother said , " and apart from that , you have done well . Now I 'll make the omelette . " The kitchenette was as neat and shining as the rest of the flat . Louis stood watching while his mother broke three eggs into a bowl , mixed them with a few strokes of the fork , seasoned them , and poured them into a hissing , buttered omelette pan . She shook and stirred with expert hands , then pushed the mixture away from her , folded it , and with a cunning turn of the wrist , slid the oblong shape out of the pan upon the waiting dish . " That 's what I call magic , " said Louis . He covered the dish and bore it into the living room , where he set it down by the fire to keep warm .. Louise followed with the soup . As she was breaking her bread into it she said : " Louis , to-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you often enough before , you have a father living in Australia . That is , he married me after your own father was killed in the War , and gave us both his name . He left me as soon as we were married and went to Australia , where his work is . I have not seen or heard from him since . Now he is coming to England for a short visit . He arrives to-morrow . He is coming here to see us , and he wishes us to go back with him to Australia . " The boy gave a long whistle and stared at his mother with astonished eyes . " That 's what I call a surprise ! Shall I like him ? Will you be glad to see him ? " " That I can not tell , " she said . " It is so long since I 've seen him that he will be a complete stranger to me . But complete , complete ! If you ask me what he is like , I can only answer that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . He was young , he was healthy , he wore the uniform of an Australian soldier . That is all I can say . " " Australia ! " said Louis . " I knew a boy at school who 'd been to Australia . " Louise saw that his interest and excitement were growing . " Yes , well , it is not yet settled by any means that we shall go . Not by any means . Now the difficulty is this . It takes a long time to know someone well as a rule , and unfortunately I must decide quickly , as he will be here less than a week . So I have been thinking very hard what it will be best to do , and what steps I shall take . Bring the omelette now , and I will tell you my plan , for I will need your help . " When Louis had gone to bed in his little room next to the kitchen , Louise went carefully through all her papers , burning a number of recent letters and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness before laying it on the flames . She then went to bed , for she intended to get up very early so that she would have time to do all the things she had to do before going to the station to meet her husband . Mrs. Blythe thought of Louise most of the following day . " What is she doing now ? " she wondered . " Has he arrived yet ? " And , " What was the meeting like ? How did he behave ? How did she feel toward him ? " She had broken the news to Roland and Catherine that their beloved " Mrs. Louise , " as they called her , might soon be leaving them for good . There were tears , and Catherine was not the only one to shed them . " Now do n't cry , children , " Mrs. Blythe said . " I only wanted to warn you that she might he going . I thought it better for you to know . There must be plenty of nice Frenchwomen in London who 'd be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they 'd be as nice as Mrs. Louise , of course , but you 'll soon get used to doing without her . I shall probably miss her longer than you will . " At two-thirty on Thursday , prompt to the minute , Louise arrived . Mrs. Blythe intercepted her on her way to the schoolroom , unwilling to wait till the lessons were over to hear the news . " Well ? " she asked . " I am going to Australia , " said Louise . " What ? You 've decided already ? " " It is better to make up one 's mind quickly , I think , than to hesitate between yes and no . That is too fa-tiguing . " " Will you come and tell me about it while I 'm resting ? " " But certainly , madame . You shall hear everything . " " Are you happy about it ? " she asked , trying to guess what was under that quiet , composed manner . " I will tell you everything , madame , at half-past four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , " said Mrs. Blythe . Louise went on her way , and Mrs. Blythe went out to do some shopping . She bought , among other things , a set of fine underwear for Louise . " Though I do n't suppose she needs it , " she thought . " Frenchwomen will go without anything else , but they 'll always contrive to wear nice undergarments . " By half-past four she was in her dressing-gown and on her sofa . Poor health weighed lightly on her , for she was indolent by nature . She gave generously to charities , asking only that she be spared the trouble of sitting on committees . Lawson brought in tea , which she placed on a table beside the couch . She brought up a chair for Mrs. Williams , poked the fire into a blaze , and left the room . Mrs. Blythe waited in delicious anticipation . Five minutes later Louise came in , a trifle behind time , she explained , owing to the children 's farewells , and Mrs. Blythe thought she saw moisture in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " sit down and do n't make me drag it out of you . You know how interested I am . I need n't stir from here for an hour , when some people are coming in for sherry , so stay as long as you can . " " As long as you please , madame , " said Louise . " I need not even hurry home to give Louis his supper . " " Do you mind telling me about it ? You must n't , of course , if you 'd rather not . My husband says I ask far too many questions and am far too much interested in other people 's affairs . " " But , madame , I look upon you as my best friend . But certainly I will tell you . First of all I should explain what it was that I decided to do . Here is a man , I thought , who has come all the way from Australia , hoping to take his wife and her son back with him , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough . Well , how will he behave ? He will do his best to please . He will be very polite . He can not take his wife by force ; he must try , therefore , to persuade by pleasant behavior . So I decide I will not make that too easy . I tell Louis what I propose to do and I ask for his help . " " How did you manage to explain to the boy what it was all about ? " " I tell him the facts , quite simply . Well then , he is anxious of course to help as much as he can . So I get up early and take the clean covers from the chairs and the sofa , showing the faded covers in which I bought them . I leave the breakfast dishes unwashed , the kitchen in disorder . I make everything untidy . I leave the beds unmade , the hearth uncleaned . I buy a bottle of whiskey , open it and leave it on the sideboard . Madame , you never saw such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis , and go to the station to meet my husband . Twice I pass him by , looking for someone quite different . At last we find each other . He is not at all bad , I think . His face is brown , his teeth good . His manners , perhaps , are a little rough , but be has been nicely brought up . These are my impressions . We shake hands , then he kisses my cheek . We talk about the voyage , and this and that . He says I have changed very much , but he makes me some compliments . We take a taxi , as he has some suit-NATURAL cases , and drive to my fiat . On the way we look at each other and think perhaps , ' Well , he is not so bad , ' and , ' She is well enough ; she is better than I expected . ' I tell him I am very busy , that I have many engagements that day , and that I must leave him at the flat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I go . " " What ? You left the boy all alone there with a strange man ? " Mrs. Blythe asked . " Louis is no longer a child . He understands quite well what to do . I go next to his school and say I am keeping him at home because his father has just returned from Australia after many years . After that I do what I please to kill the time . I look at shops , I lunch at a dairy , I go to picture galleries , I go at last to a shilling cinema . Then it is time to go home . I open the door of my flat and go in . " Louise paused , recollecting the scene of which Mrs. Blythe was now to be told . " Really , " she went on , " he is extraordinary , that man . I told Louis that if his father wished to make the flat tidy before I returned that was a good sign , and he could help him . Very well , madame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than that , there were flowers everywhere . Flowers even in my bedroom . He had bought bowls to put them in , and they were nicely arranged . He had bought fruit and nuts and sweets . He had bought ? " she paused , to give effect to her words ? " a wireless set . You can imagine , madame , the joy of my son Louis , who has never had a wireless set . When I went in they were playing it . The fire was burning well , and they had had tea . You may be sure I was pleased to see all this . And another thing , the bottle of whiskey had been put away . He had not drunk any of it . The beds were made , and though my own bed was not made quite as I like it , that was soon put right . That evening we had a splendid dinner . But a splendid dinner ! He can grill a steak , that man , to perfection . You see , madame , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations in Australia  --  he has had to do much for himself . In spite of this he is a man of some taste and refinement . Really , I was most agreeably surprised . " " I suppose in time , " Mrs. Blythe suggested , " you might grow quite fond of him . " Then as Louise paused at some memory of her own , she said , " Go on . Tell me the rest . " " Well , " said Louise , " when Louis and I told him how we had made that test of his orderliness and good temper he was much amused . In fact we all laughed a very great deal . We were like children . Louis and he are the best of friends now . And I told him that as for myself there was but one thing I could complain of , and that was the way he had made my bed . But he excused himself for that . He said that in Australia he had been sleeping for some years on a camp bed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to him when we woke up , ' Well , Jack ' ? his name is Jack , madame ? ' I never expected , yesterday ' ? but perhaps madame has heard enough , now , and it is time for me u-end my story . " " This morning ! " cried Mrs. Myth ( staring at her . " When you woke ur What on earth do you mean , Louis , You do n't mean to tell me that  --  almc complete strangers as you were ? ? " " But certainly , madame , " s2 Louise , smoothing out , upon her kn the fingers of her neatly fitting , bl : kid gloves . " He is my husband . I after all natural enough . "
