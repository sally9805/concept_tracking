GREAT BRITAIN The Commons : Chuckled at a whimsy of Sir Arthur M. Samuel , Conservative M. P. , onetime Financial Secretary of the Treasury , who had just returned from the U. S. To fellow M. P. 's who quizzed him about the U. S. , Sir Arthur handed a card on which is printed : <P> " I do not understand the Roosevelt plan . " Nor does Mr. Roosevelt . " So please do n't ask me to explain it . " Ask the Brainstorm Trust . " <P> Received from Sir Henry Bucknall Betterton , Minister of Labor , precisely the sort of bill to " reform " the British Dole which might be expected from a graduate of Rugby and Christ Church College , Oxford , and a member of the arch-Tory Carlton Club . <P> Sir Henry 's bill made Laborites see red and swear purple . It would take discretion in dole cases away from the local boards appointed by Britain 's municipal councils , many of which have just been captured by Labor in sweeping gains at the last municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government board , staffed by civil servants , would administer a much restricted dole , based on division of the jobless into three classes : 1 ) " the occasionally unemployed " ; 2 ) " the chronically unemployed " ; and 3 ) " the unemployable destitute " who would get only such relief as is provided in the Poor Laws established by Queen Elizabeth . Able-bodied dole applicants could be sent , at the discretion of the government board , to " vocational training centres . " Gone would be what wits have called " the dignity of living on the dole . " <P> Not debated last week , Sir Henry 's bill will come up for action after Parliament adjourns this week and at once reassembles to be " opened " by George V on Nov. 21 with his Cabinet 's autumn declaration of policy , the Speech from the Throne . <P> Voted down by a smashing Conservative majority a resolution against the National Government 's plan to extend the Labor Laws Act of 1920 which gives no protection as to working hours to children under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profiteers ! " stormed Lady Astor , opposing the Government despite the fact that she is a Conservative . Continued the Noble Lady : " We Conservatives are supposed to back the Government but we sometimes feel more like kicking you than backing you ! " <P> Ho-hummed at an announcement by President of the Board of Trade Walter Runciman that His Majesty 's Government in Great Britain will withdraw on Dec. 7 from President Roosevelt 's once-famed " Tariff Truce " ( TIME , May 22 ) .
