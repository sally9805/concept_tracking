Sheer animal vulgarity , including flea-scratching and grimaces , makes her a frantic success in British music halls . So while King George receives only some $550,000 per year , chiefly for being dignified , Miss Fields last year received a reputed $750,000 for being both undignified and vulgar . Four years ago , when the Manchester Guardian announced that the 4,000,000th Gracie Fields phonograph record had just been pressed , it definitively opined , " The only singer who may have exceeded Gracie Fields ' number was Caruso , but in his time figures were not carefully kept .
