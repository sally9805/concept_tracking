Momentously the Cabinet announced it has completed drafting the bill by which on July 1 , 1942 all coal in the United Kingdom is to become the property of the State . The present private owners were asked some years ago at what figure they would be willing to sell out , replied $750,000,000 . The new bill is to force them to sell out for $330,000,000 and its expected passage will provide another $50,000,000 to compensate them for special losses expected to arise in so huge a transfer . <P> The Church of England is today the largest recipient of royalties from British coal , draws some $1,850,000 yearly , while the Duke of Hamilton gets $565,000 and the Marquess of Bute $545,000 . The Church is not expected to protest as Conservative Socialism cuts its revenues , wisely figuring that , if it gets as much as Mr. Chamberlain wants to give , it should in these times thank God .
