A stooped , bespectacled man disembarked last week from the Swedish ship Drottningholm , hurried to the campus of Pennsylvania 's sedate Swarthmore College where he delivered the first of a series of endowed lectures on respiration . His first audience-biology students , faculty members , townspeople-numbered about 150 . <P> Schack August Steenberg Krogh won a Nobel Prize in 1920 for his studies on the mechanism of blood supply to muscles , showing that a muscle 's capillaries work in squads or shifts , most of them remaining closed when the muscle is resting . His great work on respiration , published in 1916 , was on the mechanism of gas exchange ( carbon dioxide for oxygen ) in lungs . Last week he pointed out that animals make structural adaptations to the available oxygen supply as to any other environmental circumstance . Frogs and toads living in oxygen-deficient waters grow abnormally large , those in oxygen-abundant waters abnormally small . South American lungfish develop extra gills when they go down to guard eggs on the oxygen-deficient bottom . Whales when diving supply oxygen only to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four or five . <P> Dr. Krogh pointed out that the oxygen intake among animals varies enormously according to bodily activity . Per kilogram of body weight , the sluggish mussel uses only 22 cubic centimetres of oxygen per minute while the busy bee consumes 17,000 cc . Man , whose activity rate varies considerably , takes in 200 to 3,000 cc . <P> On this U. S. visit , Professor Krogh will lecture at the Universities of Minnesota and Chicago as well as Swarthmore , attend biological meetings in Manhattan and elsewhere , taking with him his plain , patient wife , who is a doctor of medicine and has done valuable research on metabolism . Born to a brewer in Denmark 's Jutland 65 years ago , August Krogh ( pronounced Krug ) was fascinated by beetle larvae at the age of four . At the University of Copenhagen he ripped with great speed and facility through courses in physics , chemistry and biology , specialized in zoology , studied the respiration of marine animals on a Greenland expedition , learned to like seal meat ( " sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copenhagen the Kroghs have their living quarters in the same building with their laboratory , which makes it convenient to get to dinner from work and back to work after dinner . He drinks a lot of Carlsberg beer , more from a sense of duty than for any other reason , for the profits of this famed Copenhagen brewery go solely to support institutions of science and art . He could get no Carlsberg beer in Swarthmore last week , because in that pious Quaker town no beer , however philanthropic , is sold .
