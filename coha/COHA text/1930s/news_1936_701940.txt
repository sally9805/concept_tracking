txt Mr. JOHN R. TUNIS gives in Scribner 's the results of his patient . study of the biographies of 500 members of the Harvard class of 1911 , written for its twenty-fifth anniversary . As in similar records of most colleges , the majority have gone into business . The present-day college might almost be called a preparatory school for business . What do you make ? seems to be the most important question asked of the graduate . Thus the " insurance men make on an average $1,200 a year . " Taking thirty names at random , Mr. TUNIS finds an average income of $4,500 , " certainly not a large sum for " a preferred class with the supposed " benefits of a college education . " Since " everybody " goes to college nowadays , perhaps college graduates may fairly be registered as common stock . Thirteen clergymen represent the purpose for which the college was founded , unless we add the twentyfive farmers . Both occupations were generally followed by country pastors of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . " I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Protestant minister . " I am Roman Catholic and work at it . " These men are faithful to the Harvard of 1636 . In spite of their ancient hostility , Catholics and Puritans had more in common than they knew . The class made a good war record . The married members have been able to stay happy . No heaven-born genius , no high distinction in the arts and sciences , no leadership in thought or public life , has come to any member . What of it ? College graduates are multitudinous . Genius is apt to turn up in unexpected places . Even the glories of " Who 's Who " are often faint and ephemeral . " Apparently , we have contributed little to the world , " writes Mr. TUNIS , beyond the fact that most of us have been good citizens , raised families and paid taxes , which does not distinguish us from the mass of good citizens throughout the nation . Why should they expect to be distinguished ? What they have done is enough . Each one entitled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgotten Man . " Besides , there is nothing new in their status . The author of an old history of an old Massachusetts town lists a long row of Harvard graduates from 1642 to 1828 and a few graduates of other colleges . Their life , " he writes , " as well " as that of scholars in general , has " shown that the anticipations in refer " ende to them have not been altogether " realized . " And most of them were godly and painful preachers . Admiral BYRD when in solitude where the lines of longitude converge , where there is consequently no East and no West , where the whole earth stretches away in one direction only , found himself in the most favoring position , especially in the days and nights of his solitary vigil , to think of the world as a whole and of the human race as a unity . With such an  --  experience he has chosen to devote himself to helping to bring the peoples of the earth into a sense of their common fate and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitation . All those who have at heart the welfare of mankind will welcome the new adventuring of this hero of the two Poles in a cause more important to the race than all the physical data that the polar regions may yield . GOD speed you , " gallant gentleman . "
