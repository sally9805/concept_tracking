txt  | because Slijkhuis , the Netherlander with the bright orange panties , had moved between them . But there 's something of the old firehorse to the Mad Czech , who nobly responded to the signal for the bell lap . He was galvanized into action and sent the crowd into a dither as they stood on their seats , pounded their palms and screamed in delight . He cut down a dozen yards and nailed the Hollander as the last turn was approached . On he came , on and on in impossible fashion . The gap narrowed because Reiff had no answering sprint . Step by step Zatopek gained as the spectators howled themselves hoarse as he looked to be about to attain his totally hopeless objective . However , the Mad Czech ran out of running room much too soon . He was barely two yards back as Reiff snapped the tape . The Belgian was timed in 14:17.6 for a new Olympic record while amazing Emil from Czechoslovakia also was clocked under Gunnar Hoeckert 's old mark of 14:22.2 with a quite dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dreary afternoon , the discus throw and the pole vault . American chances were little better than so-so in the one while in the other ? well , that was locked away in the vault beyond disturbance . Our main discus hope was Fortune Gordien of Minnesota , who had been unbeaten all year but was nowhere near as good in the Summer as he 'd been in the Spring . He 'd gone over the hill while two Italians still were on the upward climb . One of them was Adolfo Consolini , now a veteran with previous Olympic experience since he 'd been a teen-ager at Berlin . He was hot on this chill day as he and his teammate , Giuseppe Tosi took turns breaking the Olympic record of 165 feet 7 %2 inches that Ken Carpenter of Southern California had set in 1936 . Gordien had to wage the fight against them alone because his two fellow Americans , Vic Frank of Yale and Bill Burton of the U. S. Army , had been too handicapped by the morning rains to qualify . Consolini scaled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tosi also surpassed the old mark with 169 feet 10 %2 inches . For that matter Gordien did it , too , with his 166 feet 7 inches . The pole vault was expected to be a one-two-three sweep by the  | United States but that was without taking into account the horrible conditions under which the contestants had to perform . The vaulting was hampered more by the rain than any other event . Not only was the runway slippery but the poles were slippery , too . All during the long afternoon the vaulters kept ducking into a tunnel , poles in their hands , and they 'd emerge only long enough to vault . Then they 'd disappear again . America 's best and most consistent operative , A. Richmond Morcom , University of New Hampshire alumnus , aggravated an old knee injury and elected to pass up an intermediate height in order to conserve his efforts for a greater height . And he missed it , to finish a most disappointing sixth . By way of following the original script , though , victory went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California . It was ironic that he triumphed because the 28-year-old veteran of eighteen months of combat flying with the Army Air Force had been advised by medical specialists many months previously to quit competition in order to protect a torn cartilage in his knee . But he did n't quit , and an Olympic championship was the result even though his final vault of 14 feet 1 % inches was made in semiprivacy . His was the last event and even the hardy English had all departed the rain-drenched area by then . Earlier in the afternoon the amazing Fanny Blankers-Koen of The Netherlands , a 30-year-old Dutch hausfrau and mother of two , won the women 's century , the first of her many stunning performances . Under a rapidly closing blanket of darkness with a dreary drizzle adding to the dreary setting , another Olympic show passed into history . The next day , Tuesday , Aug. 3 , was not much of an improvement as far as weather conditions were concerned . The sky was slate-gray , pregnant with rain , and the day eternally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drenching it had been receiving , precluding any performances of real merit . Although the undiscouraged Britons sent the turnstiles whirling once again , they whirled them only to the extent of a gathering of 70,000.  | It was n't capacity by any stretch of the imagination or any shrinkage of the seats , but it was a truly remarkable outpouring of the faithful . It was n't Bank Holiday but merely a normal week-day . Still the Britishers spewed out of the Underground and other methods of conveyance for another look at the greatest show they 'd had in forty years . Or at least since the Coronation ? which , mind you , was for free . Besides , there were only three finals . The most important of these was in the 200-metre dash . Patton , the Pell-Mell Kid from the Coast , had sorrowfully said after the 100-metre event was completed , " What a terrible way to end a career ! " He 'd been a miserable fifth then and seemed to have the notion that his shot at Olympic glory had passed him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't showed any clear-cut superiority in any of the preliminary heats . In fact , this race was one of those wideopen affairs where the main contenders seemed to be Patton , Ewell , La Beach , the Panama ace , and McKenley , the shoo-in winner of the 400 which still was to come . However , there is something unsatisfactory about any race which is staged in lanes with a staggered start . Leaders are never clear cut and obvious . For the final McKenley was on the pole , Patton in No. 2 , La Beach in No. 3 , Ewell in No. 4 , Cliff Bourland of Southern California in No. 5 and the utter stranger , Leslie Laing of Jamaica in No. 6 . But Patton , who never was a particularly notable getaway artist , really got a lift for the big one . He burst off his marks and it soon was evident that he and Ewell would battle it out . Only once did he falter in his smooth , rhythmic striding . Fifty yards from home , when Barney had catapulted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached into his reserve strength to find the answer . This had been a two-man race all the way , surprising as that , might seem in the light of the class of the other contestants . Yet the dominating figures were Patton and Ewell , vivid contrasts in everything except the white uniforms they wore . When the 30-year-old happy-go-lucky Ewell made his supreme bid , the Pell-  | Mell Kid matched him to win his Olympic championship by a scant foot in the great time of 21.1 . The real record-wrecking of the day , however , came at the hands of the shotputters . When they opened up shop for business the Olympic mark stood at 53 feet 1 % inches , the property of Hans Woellke of Germany . But a trio of American muscle-men just about whipsawed that record to death while making a clean sweep of the event . The champion was Wilbur ( Moose ) Thompson of Southern California and the Los Angeles A. C. , a 27-year-old former staff sergeant . He put his full 195 pounds behind one toss to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56-footer in the annals of the sport . Second to him was James Francis Delaney , Notre Dame graduate from the San Francisco Olympic Club with 54 feet 8 %2 inches and third was Jim Fuchs , a Yale football star , with 53 feet 10%2 inches . It was Fuchs , the Old Blue , who was the first to crack the old record and the rest of our boys followed his example until they were surpassing it with virtually every throw . The day 's other final was in the hop , step and jump , a test in which the United States has been notoriously weak for the better part of a half-century . Our triple-jumpers went to London just for the ride and none of them qualified . So the order of finish became Arne Ahman of Sweden , Gordon Avery of Australia , K. Sarfalp of Turkey , Preben Larsen of Denmark , G. Oliveria of Brazil and K. J. V. Rautio , of Finland . The winning distance was an indifferent 50 feet 6 ? inches . Wednesday , Aug. 4 , being the birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brought her out to see the Olympics , the first inspection their Majesties had made of the proceedings since the Opening Ceremonies . A gathering of 80,000 , braving threatening skies , turned out to greet them . Before the Games began , the British had pointedly stated that their national anthem would be played only twice , at the Opening and at the Closing . They added with some understandable mischievousness that this was exactly 478 fewer times than the German anthem had been played at Berlin in 1936 . But they had to change  | that count to 477 . When the royal party arrived , the band struck up , " God Save the King . " The King and the Queen witnessed the prettiest event on the entire program , the 110-metre hurdles final . Everyone knew , of course , that an American would win it and everyone suspected that it might even develop into an American sweep . And that 's precisely what happened . In Bill Porter of Northwestern University and Craig Dixon of U.C.L.A. , the United States possessed a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts glistened at the sight of them . The third of the American hurdlers was Clyde ( Smackover ) Scott , a football halfback at Arkansas of All-American rating . Strength , speed and grim determination always have been his forte rather than intrinsic hurdling skill . He just bulls over them and , being " the world 's best competitor , " he had gone much farther than his talents would indicate . Since Porter had won both the National AAU championship and the final Olympic tryouts , he was the natural favorite . A rangy 160-pounder who stood 6-foot-3 , he had become a hurdler by accident in high school . He tried to be a baseball player at the Hill School but failed to make the squad . Since athletics are compulsory for all students there , he switched to track , discovered that he was too slow to be a sprinter and took a fling at hurdling . By such fortuitous occurrences are champions born . Porter was the winner in the Olympic record time of 13.9 while Scott , the runner-up , and Dixon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clocking equal to the old mark that Forrest Towns of Georgia posted in 1936 . The officials erred somewhere . It was obvious from the stands that Dixon was only inches behind Porter and , if Scott split between them ? the press box tenants did n't think he did ? all three of their times should have been 13.9 or 14 flat at worst . But it was all in the family and no one was going to argue very vehemently about either the placings or the clockings . Although the United States representatives invariably are outclassed in the javelin throw , this was one time when we were deemed to have an outside chance . Our main hope rested on the  | strong right arm of Dr. Steve Seymour , an osteopath who was born in New York , educated in Philadelphia 's Temple University and who has established Los Angeles as his home . His throw of 248 feet 10 inches a year ago was infinitely superior to that ever turned in by any other American , even though he had n't come close to matching it during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching it at London . If he had been able to do so , he 'd have won in a breeze . The favorite in the test had been Sven Daleflod of Sweden , but he was ill and unable to take a shot at it . The winner proved to be Kaj Tapio Rautavaara of Finland , who is , of all things , a movie actor . Never did he have a more rewarding role than this one as he hurled the spear 228 feet 10 inches . Seymour was second with 221 feet 7 inches . That quite " Marvelous Mama " from Holland , Fanny BlankersKoen , achieved the first women 's double since Babe Didrikson when she broke the world 's record in the 80-metre hurdles ? she had equalled the old mark of 11.3 the day before ? with 11.2 seconds . The Hollander later was joined as a double-winner when Micheline Oestermeyer of France added the shotput title to her javelin crown . The women 's broad jump was captured by Mrs. Olga Gyarmiti of Hungary . The sixth day of the track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured down steadily all morning and the track was a dull , soggy bowl of mush by the afternoon . Despite the dismal rain and mist , the hardy Britishers kept the turnstiles spinning the same merry tune . Some 67,000 of them braved the elements and thereby broke the only Olympic record the British were to fracture . It was the one for total receipts for the track and field phase of the program , the $1,400,000 they paid surpassing all others , including the ones at Los Angeles whose attendance they also topped . The attraction was a sure-fire one , the 400-metre final where McKenley was supposed to have his date with destiny . Perhaps this is the proper spot to tell something about the light-complexioned Negro from Jamaica . In his five years in the United States , first at Boston College and then at the University of Illinois , he developed into the finest quarter-miler in the world .  | He drove the world 's record for the 440 yards to 46 seconds flat and the world 's record for the 440 metres to 45.9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race he ran that year was under 47 seconds , utterly incredible going . Of all the 6,000 athletes in the Olympic Games , he was more certain of winning than any of the others . McKenley was in the perfect spot for the final , however . Bolen was on the pole , a position rarely envied because the runner has the mental hazard of the curbing and usually travels wide of it , thus adding extra yards to his journey . The best position of them all , though , is the second lane where the athlete is not bothered by curbing , and where he can see from the staggered start the other four contenders . McKenley was in the second lane . Lady Luck could not have smiled more sweetly on him . Even the temperature was to his liking since he prefers it on the coolish side despite the fact that his 45.9 was achieved in 90-degree heat . Perhaps the Jamaica Negro with the Oxford-English accent was thinking too hard about a statement he once made . It was : " Once I go around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody is going to beat me . " It was not said in vainglory . It was a simple and well-proved exposition of fact . And Hustling Herbert hit the homestretch in the lead . He rocketed off his mark at such furious gait that he kept picking up one rival after another in their staggered lanes . Some unofficial clockers caught him in 21-seconds flat for the 200 , faster time than Patton had achieved in winning the 200-metre dash itself . He pulled even with Wint , with Whitfield , with Guida and almost with Curotta , all from their staggered lanes . As they all straightened out for that stretch run , there was an automatic gasp of amazement from the crowd at the size of his lead , now apparent for the first time . McKenley had four full yards on Wint , eight over Whitfield . The " surest thing " in the Olympics never looked surer . But his fellow Jamaican was wearing his most fashionable set of sevenleague boots . With his 9-foot stride Wint began to climb . Inch by inch and foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd went wild . They had grown to like this amiable 6-foot-4 giant , the  | 26-year-old son of a Presbyterian minister , ever since he had joined the Royal Air Force in Britain during the war and then stayed on to become a medical student at the University of London . As the big fellow thundered after his more redoubtable foe , McKenley , the flawless runner who never faltered , actually began to tie up . For the first time it became quite apparent that he might be beaten . With relentless stride Wint slashed after him , cutting that margin to shreds . A dozen yards from the finish he made it . At the wire it was Wint by two full yards in the magnificent time of 46.2 seconds to equal the Olympic record which Bill Carr of the United States had posted at Los Angeles in 1932 . There was one other final , the 3,000-metre steeplechase , on which the Swedes were acknowledged to have a hammerlock . They did . They took turns leading and , when the Smorgasbord was finally sorted out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagstroem . The decathlon men began their arduous ten-event grind on this dismal , misty afternoon and completed half of their chores . The leader was Enrique Kistenmacher of Argentina , an Army officer , followed closely by Ignace Heinrich of France , a 20-year-old from Alsace . Then followed the three Americans , Bob Mathias , the " baby " of the Olympic team , from Tulare , Calif. ; Floyd Simmons of the Los Angeles A. C. and Irving ( Moon ) Mondschein of New York University . The Argentinian had the day 's top performance in the 100 , the 400 and the broad jump but the man ? except boy would be the better word ? whom all were watching was Mathias , the 17-yearold , who was the most likely winner . Unlike most decathlon men he had no strong events and no weak events . He was just very good at all of them . In fact he vas. very good at everything , the most versatile athlete the United States had had since the immortal Jim Thorpe ruled supreme thirty-six years ago . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent physique that no one could feel sorry for him . Nor did anyone ask that he be separated from the men and forced to play with the boys . The best high school football player on the Pacific Coast , he also was a - basketball performer of such  | skill that he had merely averaged 18 points a game the previous season . Mathias was the glamor boy of the Olympic Games and he proved it the very next day . That day was a most gloomy Friday , Aug. 6 . It probably was the absolutely worst day of the entire Olympic tournament , perhaps the very worst day in Olympic history . If not , it was at least the runner-up . The rain came down in buckets in the morning and in junior-size buckets in the afternoon . Ignoring the weather conditions and the weather forecasts with true British indifference , a small ( Ahem ! ) crowd of 75,000 bounced blithely out to Wembley . Zounds and Gadzooks ! No wonder those British won the war . They proved that they can stand anything . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,500 , always a high spot of the Games . But they also had worked up an irresistible curiosity over the decathlon and the fate of the remarkable infant prodigy , Robert Bruce Mathias . He started to compete at 10:30 A.M. under abominable weather conditions . Twelve hours later he finished his grueling labors in the semi-darkness of flickering lights in the stands while the Olympic flame cast a golden glow from the peristyle . The physical handicaps under which he performed were monumental , and the mental handicaps so enormous that a less talented or less indomitable athlete must have wilted under such malevolent pressure . Mathias did not wilt . That 's why his victory in the decathlon must rank as one of the truly great exploits in Olympic history . The decathlon contestants had been divided into two groups and all those in the first group contrived to finish up before nightfall . However , Mathias was one of the unfortunates in the second group while every one of his chief rivals was in the first , a disturbing item which hardly could have helped the infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully planned time schedule topsy-turvy . For twelve hours Mathias was huddled under a blanket in the rain , emerging only to compete . His only food consisted of two box lunches and by the evening he was too tired even to eat . Everything went wrong for the boy . One careless official picked up the flag which had marked the spot where the young Cali-  | fornian had scaled his discus . So the officials feverishly searched for an hour and a half before they could find the tiny hole in the turf where the mark had been . He had to pole vault in the ghostly , ghastly half-light from the stands . The cross-bar was an indistinct blur that was barely perceptible as he charged down the slippery runway with a slippery pole in his hands . Yet no one vaulted higher than his 11 feet 5 3/4 inches . It was so dark when his turn came to throw the javelin that he missed the take-off line entirely and then required the aid of a flashlight , which was beamed on the foul line , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But by that time he had only one event remaining , the 1,500-metre run , and his point total was of sufficient size to assure him of victory , even though he did little more than jog through the metric mile . By that time also the 75,000 spectators had dwindled only to a scattered handful , including his parents , Dr. and Mrs. Charles Mathias , and two of his brothers . It was a fantastic performance under preposterous conditions . The King of Sweden said to Jim Thorpe thirty-six years previously . " You , sir , are the greatest athlete in the world . " If King George had been around when the decathlon competition ended , he could have used the identical words to Mathias . Just to keep the records straight , here are his ten performances : 100 metres , 11.2 seconds ; 400 metres , 51.7 seconds ; high jump , 6 feet 1% inches ; shotput , 42 feet 9% inches ; broad jump , 21 feet 8 %z inches ; 110-metre hurdles , 15.7 seconds ; discus throw , 144 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; javelin throw , 165 feet 1 inch , and 1,500-metres , 5:11 ? all adding up to 7,139 points . Only an achievement of the herculean proportions of Mathias could have taken the play away from the classic 1,500-metre run , one of the top events of any Olympic program . This test had been conceded to the Swedes long before it started because they packed too much fire power . And the heaviest gun in the entire armory was Lennart Strand , a wisp of a blond at 5-foot-8 and 145 pounds . He 'd been elected as much of a " sure thing " in his event as McKenley had in his specialty . The irony of that was to become apparent .  | Strand , the co-holder of the world record for the distance at 3:43 , is an elfin-footed runner of graceful bounding stride . But he could n't do much bounding in the puddle-strewn track where the sticky clay imprisoned his feet with every step . So wretched were the conditions that it was a day for strength rather than sheer speed . That strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28-year-old fireman from Gavle who was the third ranking member of the Smorgasbord Swifties and who had never beaten Strand in his life . Yet in the most important duel they ever were to wage , he did it . Strand 's only excuse ? and a good one , too ? could have been the leaden , soggy track . He was in good position all the way , trailing Hansenne , the French half-miler , for the first 1,000 metres . But then Eriksson gathered himself together and made his bid . He passed Strand and he passed the tiring Frenchman . Once he took the lead he never yielded it . But Strand , relying on his stronger sprint finish , permitted Eriksson to blaze the trail into the home stretch . Then he moved into high gear , climbing steadily down the straightaway until he had advanced to the shoulder of his compatriot . According to the script , Eriksson should have given way then and there . But apparently he had n't bothered to read the script . In his ignorance he just kept on running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , realizing that he did n't have what it takes , gave up the ghost . Acknowledging defeat , he looked around to see if his runner-up role was secure and discovered that it was n't . Slijkhuis , the Hollander , was climbing up his back on the inside . So Strand veered in to shut him out and they collided just as the finish line was reached with the Swede still second . Eriksson 's winning time was a very remarkable 3:49.8 and , had the track been drier , he could n't have missed cracking Jack Lovelock 's Olympic record . This being a day for shattering precedents that flaxen-haired Dutch girl , Fanny Blankers-Koen , shattered a big one . She won the 200-metre sprint , a new event on the program , and thereby be-  | came the first triple winner that the female of the species ever has produced in the Olympics . Little did the Olympic jury dream , though , what monumental work still lay ahead of it . The last day of the track and field , Saturday , August 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those nasty things , creating ill will and giving the Olympics a bad name . An American relay team was disqualified for illegal baton-passing and it took four days for the jury to decide the justice of the protests . Before another sell-out crowd of 83,000 , which set a new Olympic record for track and field receipts at $2,000,000 , Great Britain won its first Olympic championship . But Britain did n't win it the way this vast crowd would have preferred , by fleetness of foot . The United States quartet of Barney Ewell , Lorenzo Wright , Harrison Dillard and Mel Patton soundly trounced the Britons by six yards in the 400-metre relay only to have an official issue the ruling that the baton exchange between Ewell and Wright had been made outside the legal zone . Thus did the English win a championship that they 'd yearned so desperately to attain . Yet the sportsmanlike crowd gave a far more rousing ovation to the disqualified Americans than to their own lads , who had really backed into the title instead of winning it on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four days , in this space , to see what happened to the formal American protest of the ruling . The Olympic Jury of Appeal made a careful study of J. Arthur Rank 's official movies and there was nothing they could do except countermand the observation of the slightly astigmatic judge who had detected an illegality which never existed . The movies demonstrated beyond doubt that the baton pass had been made well within the proper chalk lines . At the same time they revealed that the track was crisscrossed by so many markings that the error was understandable if not excusable . Four days later the band had to unplay ? if that 's the word ? " God Save the King " and toot out the " Star Spangled Banner . " More embarrassing still , the authorities had to pry loose the gold medals from the four Britons and give them to the Americans . They also had to take the silver medals from Italy and hand them to the 211  | British . Worse still , they had to separate the Hungarians from their bronze medals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more substantial than receipts . Oh , yes , Canada was fifth and Holland sixth . The other men 's relay final of the last day also produced a most unsatisfactory ending . The American quartet of Art Harnden of Texas A. &; M. , Bourland , Cochran and Whitfield was right in the midst of giving the Jamaica team an unholy drubbing when things happened . Cochran , the 400-metre hurdles champion , had extended his lead on the massive Art Wint , the 400-metre flat victor , to a full fifteen yards when the Jamaica giant clutched at his leg and went reeling off the track in complete collapse . A leg cramp had finished him and thus made secure an American victory which was nine-tenths won already . But it did take some of the savor from the victory . The winning time was a smashing 3:10.4 with France , Sweden and Finland taking the other places . Neither Jamaica nor Italy was able to finish . Third of the relay finals saw Fanny Blankers-Koen of The Netherlands become a blond , female counterpart of Jesse Owens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the women 's 400-metre relay for her country in 47.5 . This feat earned the Dutch matron her fourth gold medal . In the only other women 's event Alice Coachman of the United States won the high jump at the record height of 5 feet 6 %a inches , winning the crown from Mrs. Dorothy Tyler of Great Britain on fewer misses . The marathon always has been a big moment in the Olympics , but it 's to be doubted that any previous marathon produced as unlikely a champion as this one , even though unknowns have made a habit of marching off with the top prize . There were favorites , part favorites and dark horses but no one ever had been heard to mention Delfo Cabrera of Argentina , including the Argentinians . To them he was merely their third stringer , a 29-year-old fireman from Buenos Aires , who did n't have a ghost of a chance . He certainly did n't seem to have it for the better part of the torturous grind of 26 miles , 385 yards , over one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympics . For seventeen miles Etienne Gailly of Belgium , a 22-year-old ex  | paratrooper , led the parade . Then the leader was a little Korean , Yun Chil Choi . At twenty-five miles , though , Gailly took a new lease on life and also took over the pace-setting task . While the marathoners were plodding about the English countryside , the spectators in the stadium were kept apprised of what was happening over the loud-speaker system . There was a rumble of electric excitement when word was issued that the leaders were approaching . Necks craned eagerly toward the tunnel beneath the royal box and a figure burst through . But there were gasps of dismay at sight of him . Groggy , limping and bent over , he staggered onto the track and gazed around him in vacuous-faced bewilderment . It was Gailly , so far in distress that he was in imminent danger of toppling over on his face . Hardly had he stumbled onto the track for one final lap when another figure dashed out of the tunnel , running strongly and the obvious winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , he overhauled the rubber-legged Belgian and was off to claim the crown . The other of the day 's finals was the 10,000-metre walk which went to John Mikaelsson of Sweden as the first five finishers broke the Olympic record . The spectacular track and field part of the Olympic program had come to a close . It was a magnificent show , magnificently handled and magnificently attended despite scorching heat , relentless rain and the most miserable conditions imaginable . The enthusiasm of the British public was particularly extraordinary in the light of the fact that the Games had been so unadvertised in advance as to resemble the best-kept secret of the century . The United States fell just one short of matching its twelve victories which had been achieved at Berlin but its eleven gold medals were not to be scorned . Neither were the four silver medals nor the nine bronze ones . In the runner-up post was Sweden with five firsts , three seconds and four thirds , a rather exceptional job in view of the fact that the populations of the two contending nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed that eight Olympic records were smashed and two tied by the men , a rather high output under execrable weather conditions .  | Although this narrative , as has been so often said , is primarily an account of the track and field , it might be well to take one quick glance at what happened elsewhere . From an American standpoint , the men 's swimming was sufficient to take one 's breath away . We had been expected to score heavily but even the most optimistic soul in camp did n't dare dream that we 'd make an unprecedented clean sweep of the entire program . The " certain winners " in track had failed but the certain winners ? without the quotation marks ? in swimming proved to be precisely that . The invincible Joe Verdeur of Philadelphia 's La Salle College , the greatest breast stroker in the history of the world , set a new Olympic mark in winning the 200-metre breast stroke in 2:39.3 . The backstroke favorite , Allen Stack of Yale , came through on schedule with 1:06.4 . Just by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark . The real stunner , though , came in the 100-metre free style where Alex Jany of France was supposed to be such a shoo-in that even Bob Kiphuth of Yale , the head coach of the American natators , was far from sanguine . He was even less sanguine when Wally Ris of Iowa , his best operative , came down with housemaid 's knee or its equivalent ? actually it was a trick football knee ? on the eve of the Games . But the strapping Ris ploughed through to victory in 57.3 seconds for an Olympic record . Bill Smith set an Olympic record with 4:41 in the 400-metre free style . Our 800-metre relay team , anchored by Smith , the Irish-Hawaiian heavyweight , not only set an Olympic record but a world mark of 8:46 as well . Jimmy McLane , a 17-year-old Andover schoolboy , barely missed new figures when he was timed in 19:18.5 in the 1,500-metre free style . Bruce Harlan of Ohio State won the springboard diving and Dr. Sammy Lee , a Korean-American from Occidental College and the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed , though . Mrs. Victoria Manalo Draves of Los Angeles won both of the dives and the very photogenic Ann Curtis won the 400 in record time even though Greta Andersen of Denmark beat her in the 100 . The handsome Miss Curtis also swam the anchor leg on the winning relay team . Karen  | Harup of Denmark cracked the Olympic figures in the backstroke and Nel van Vliet of The Netherlands did the same thing in the breast stroke . The rowing was both disappointing and stimulating from an American standpoint . The biggest disappointment came when Jack Kelly , Jr. , of the University of Pennsylvania , the best sculler in the world , failed to win the single sculls as his father had done before him in 1920 . Winner of the Diamond Sculls and every major sculling title , the handsome Philadelphia youngster was so weakened by a heavy cold that he collapsed at the finish line and was eliminated by Eduardo Risso of Uruguay in the semi-finals on the rain-lashed Thames . Risso , in turn , later was beaten by Mervyn Wood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program came when the United States captured the four-oared shell with coxswain , our Olympic victories being few and far between in any event under the fulldress eight-oared test . This was won by a University of Washington quartet , the stern four of the boatload which had swept the Hudson at Poughkeepsie but failed in the final tryouts . California surprised by winning the eight-oared trials but it did n't surprise by winning the Olympic crown , the third victory for the Golden Bears in Olympic competition and the easiest of the three . Other rowing triumphs were scored by Great Britain with two and both Italy and Denmark with one each . The basketball tournament produced the expected American success . The U. S. squad , especially composed of the Phillips Oilers and the University of Kentucky quintets , was much too big and too skillful for any other nation . It was especially too big ; Bob Kurland of the Oilers , a former Oklahoma Aggie star , undoubtedly was the tallest athlete the Olympics ever have produced . He stood an even 7-feet in his stocking feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rally to turn back Argentina , 59-57 , midway through the tournament . But that was their only close call as they went on to crush France , 65-21 , in the final . Not only did the United States have the tallest man in Kurland but they also had one of the smallest in Joe Di Pietro , a 4-foot-6 weight lifter , who was one of four American victors in the weight  | lifting . The muscle-men set Olympic records in every weight division as our other winners were Frank Spellman , Stan Stanczyk and John Davis , our best international showing . In wrestling the United States produced two champions , Glenn Brand of Iowa State , a middleweight , and the unbeaten New York police detective , Henry Wittenberg , a light-heavyweight . Americans even won in canoeing , shooting , yachting and equestrian . By the time the accountants and statisticians had added it all up , this country had taken a lion 's share of the swag from the lair of the British Lion with thirty-eight Olympic crowns . Sweden was next with seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unofficial one always is kept .

The gargantuan show ended on Saturday , August 14 , in as dramatic and soul-stirring a fashion as it had begun . For the first time the temperamental English weather behaved perfectly , a rich , warm sun warming the hearts of the 80,000 who packed Wembley Stadium for the grand finale . The crowd thrilled to the superb jumping of the equestrian competition earlier in the afternoon . Then as shadows lengthened over the arena and a fading sunset bathed it in a ruddy glow , they thrilled anew to the glorious pageantry of the Closing Ceremonies as staged by those masters of pageantry , the British hosts . At six o'clock on the dot , flag-bearers carried the flags of all competing nations into the stadium in alphabetical order with Greece again holding its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards , attired in their ceremonial bearskin helmets and scarlet tunics , played the " March of the Gladiators . " The Greek national anthem was played , then the British and finally the Finnish because it is Finland which is to be host to the 1952 Games . J. Siegfried Edstrom of Sweden , president of the International Olympic Committee , formally recited the closing ritual . Royal trumpeters sounded a fanfare . Cannons roared in salute . The Olympic flag slowly descended the mast at one end of the  | arena and the Olympic flame dwindled away and quietly died at the other end of the stadium . The Games of the Fourteenth Olympiad were over . With some feelings of trepidation instead of the usual bold assurance , the true Olympians looked toward Helsinki and 1952 . Hardly had the shouting and the tumult died , hardly had the echoes of the saluting cannon faded down the tunnels of time , when an ominous political note intruded itself .

What was the precise coloration , a true rosy tint or an ominous Red ? For more than half a century the Olympic movement had lived dreamily and idealistically in a microcosm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung from the cloud of supra-nationalism , far above the provincialism and chauvinism of the world at large . Not only was it completely divorced from politics but it was blinded to the very existence of politics . However , the Olympians soon discovered that it was as impossible to ignore Red communism as it would be for you to ignore a huge bear which plumped itself down in your living room and carelessly flicked cigar ashes on your cherished oriental rug . Even before the Olympic year had dawned , the sporting fraternity was asking itself the identical question which had been perplexing the world at large for a much longer time : What will the Russians do ? The Soviet Union had expressed a mild interest in the 1948 Games , even sending observers to St. Moritz and to London . But the athletic pace behind the Iron Curtain accelerated between Olympics . The Russians joined more and more international sports federations in order to gain Olympic eligibility . They even had  | made a few ventures into the free world for athletic competition after retreating into their shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental miscalculation involving Russian weight lifters in the world championships at Paris . The Soviet was positive it would win . But an undermanned , hastily recruited American team was assembled at the last minute . And what did our decadent capitalists do but triumph . Thereupon the red-faced Reds had to buy a trophy to take back to Moscow as symbolic of their " victory . " The Russians entered the world boxing championships at Milan in 1951 and then sat in stony-faced silence in the stands , inexplicably refusing to compete . They entered the European track championships at Brussels in 1950 and won by a whisker , thanks mainly to the point sweeps their Amazons made in the women 's events . There was one disturbing incident , though . A relay heat was ordered re-run by the officials after a mix-up in lanes . The Soviet runners flatly refused until they first had consulted with the Kremlin . Apparently they were ordered to re-run the race . They did . What 's more , they won it . However , nothing quite like that ever before had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help viewing these strange proceedings with an attitude of disquiet and uneasiness . In other words , the Soviet was as unpredictable and as far removed from normal patterns of procedure or behavior in the world of sports as it was in the world at large . That 's why the shadow of the Russian Bear loomed so hugely over all Olympic thoughts as to dominate them completely . It was impossible to mention the Olympics without adding the inevitable corollary : What will the Russians do ? The first folks to have to ask that question in something resembling official tones were the Organizing Committee for the Winter Olympic Games in Oslo , the capital of Norway . The Norwegians had done a magnificent job and were justifiably proud of what they had to offer . They never claimed that they had invented snow but no nation knew better what use to make of it . It was Sondre Nordheim of Morgedal in Telemark , a  | Norwegian of course , who is deemed the father of modern skiing . And the Norsemen have dominated the Winter Olympics from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medals and in total points . On top of all that , Oslo had perfect weather conditions , so unlike all other Olympic sites which had been embarrassed by thaws and lack of snow for most previous competitions . With understandable smugness the Norwegians boasted , " Weather conditions for skiing in Oslo are perfect nine months of the year . During the other three months they merely are a little less favorable . " Oh , yeah ? But before the Norwegians had a chance to be at all concerned about the weather for their Olympic show from Feb. 14 to 25 , they anxiously awaited the start of the Olympic year for more reasons than one . New Year 's Day was the deadline on entries . They , too , had begun to ask the now ageless question : What will the Russians do ? The Reds , it seemed , were not going to do anything . They let the deadline pass as twenty-eight nations formally entered . A week later the totally unpredictable Soviet formally entered the Olympics ? but it was the Summer Olympics at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later the Red brothers cautiously sought admission to the international ice hockey federation as a preliminary to being represented at Oslo . However , their application was turned down as being " too late " and also " too vague . " That settled that , even though the post entries of both Israel and Chile were accepted to bring the number of competing nations up to thirty . Even without the Soviet , though , the Norwegians held their collective breath when the teams from two Russian satellites , Poland and Bulgaria , detrained at the Oslo station at the same time as the West Germans . But the athletes merely eyed each other curiously and passed along without any incident . In fact , curiosity was the only emotion to be stirred in both sets of Olympic Games by the mingling of the East and the West . What really scared the Norwegians was that their " perfect weather " began to misbehave . Not only did they start to run out  | of snow but forecasts for the future were even more alarming . Not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were less than a week away . By way of making things worse , gales persisted in blowing away what snow still remained on the ground . The hardy Norsemen then officially admitted that snow conditions were critical . They closed off the Roedkleiva slalom course , the last remaining ski track still usable . At Norefjell , where most of the ski events were scheduled to take place , a perspiring crew of three hundred volunteer workers ? soldiers , firemen and civilians ? shoveled snow and pumped tons of water and snow onto the ski tracks . Training was so risky an operation that even the most expert skiers fell like novices . The runs either were covered with too much ice or too little snow . Or both . Nor were the tender sensibilities of the disconcerted Norwegians alleviated by the fact that winter resorts in both Switzerland and France , as well as America 's Lake Placid , impishly offered to rescue the harassed Norse by replacing Oslo as an Olympic site . Norwegian officials saw nothing humorous in these offers . " The Games will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official spokesman . They even got so stubborn about the matter that they refused to change the courses for the alpine competition from Norefjell to snowier spots in Norway , up nearer the North Pole , for instance . The only concession they grudgingly made was to shorten the course for the women 's giant slalom course some 200 metres in order to eliminate the treacherous icy finishing stretch . They also postponed the women 's downhill race a couple of days . Two days before the formal opening of the Olympics , the volunteers were ma ' - ing good progress in their snow-shoveling activities . But that did n't hearten the red-faced host nation half as much as the wonderful news the weather forecaster uncovered . A snowstorm , he announced , already was en route from Iceland . Dear old Iceland ! How the Norwegians loved every glacier on it ! The snow arrived on schedule , two delightful inches of it . And the Norse smiled happily for the first time in weeks . Competition actually began a day before the formal opening of  | the Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an American , no less , becoming the initial Olympic champion of 1952 . Flashing down a mountainside through fifty-nine artfully placed control gates of the giant slalom course , a slender 19-year-old housewife from Rutland , Vermont , Mrs. Andrea Mead Lawrence , whisked to victory . With the gifted artistry of a ballerina she spun and twisted and sped to a hair's-breath triumph over the strikingly beautiful Austrian movie actress , Dagmar Rom , while the American beauty queen , Katy Rodolph of Denver University , muscled into the points with a fifth place . Thus did the United States , never before a power in winter sports , take the lead in the unofficial team standings that Olympic authorities have been deploring and condemning from time immemorial It was a tenuous lead , of course . By the time Princess Ragnhild of Norway formally opened the Games the next day it had almost vanished . The Princess was acting as representative of her grandfather , King Haakon , and her father , Crown Prince Olaf , both of whom were in London for the funeral of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good , as Norway , the host nation , made a runaway of the competition . The Norse finished with 125 %2 large but unofficial points to 89 ? for a surprising American team ( the best Winter Olympic showing in our history ) , 72 for Finland , 60 for Austria , 50 ? for Germany and 29 ? for disappointing and disappointed Sweden . The brilliantly staged Norwegian show ( once Oslo weather reverted to normal perfection ) had several highlights . Not only did Mrs. Lawrence win the giant slalom but she also won the regular slalom with a performance which bordered on the impossible . In the first of her two runs down the course , she spilled . It should have eliminated her , but it did n't . Quickly regaining her feet ? or her skis ? she tore recklessly down the course . She was even more reckless in her next run and was so much faster than anyone else that she triumphed on the combined time totals almost with room to spare . There also was the highlight of Hjalmar Anderson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one in Olympic record figures and another in world record clocking . Ken Henry of the United States took the only other event , the 500-metre sprint , which eluded the sturdy-legged Norseman . There was the highlight of the incomparable Dick Button of the United States retaining his Olympic figure skating championship for the fourth American victory , our biggest gold medal sweep in winter history . There also was the highlight of the vast and record crowd of 150,000 packed around the Holmenkollen hill for the ski jumping . It was won by Arnfinn Bergmann of Norway , symbolically enough , as King Haakon and the entire royal family watched from a portable platform just below the take-off . The only sour notes came from the only bodily contact sport of the winter show , ice hockey . Americans got into fist fights with Poles in one game and a Swiss was slugged in another . That second one caused the bigger commotion as a Swiss newspaper characterized Americans as " rowdies " and demanded an end to " the pollution of European hockey by overseas teams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a right-handed slam at us because the vigorous play of athletes from this continent does n't fit in with the more polite tactics of Europeans . When Canada 's Olympic champions were held to a 3-3 tie in the grand finale of the hockey tournament by the United States , the charge was bluntly made in the Moscow press that the Canadians had " thrown " the game to the Americans as part of a dirty , behind-the-scenes plot to keep Czechoslovakia , a Soviet pet , from tying the United States for second place . Oh , yes . When Oslo 's show was over , a Russian sports spokesman stated in effect , " The Soviet Union would have won the Winter Olympics if it had bothered to enter . " It was the most soulstirring declaration since a little boy in a street fight tearfully boasted to his conquerors , " My old man kin lick your old man . So there ! " What it actually amounted to in the final analysis was that the Russians , even in absentia , were never entirely out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been most concerned about the Soviet was valiant , ruggedly independent Finland . The Finns were the host country for the huge Summer Games ; they rested against the fringe of the Iron Curtain ; they had fought Russian invaders only a few short years before ; they were paying promptly , as is their deeply ingrained habit , the crushing , back-breaking reparation debt the Reds demanded , and they had reason to fear that some trifling incident might be magnified out of all proportion by the overly-sensitive Soviet . The Finns should have had the jitters from the dawn of the Olympic year until the Games were safely over . But they acted throughout as though they just did n't give a hoot . They probably did n't , either . In their quiet and efficient fashion they went about their preparations with total unconcern . They may have paused with puzzled shakes of their heads on one occasion . But they said nothing . They could have said a lot . Tradition calls for the lighting of a torch in the sacred grove of Olympia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site of the Olympic Games . There it is used to light the huge Olympic flame which burns majestically until the Games are ended . The Finns , planning the route from Olympia to Helsinki , made formal request of the Soviet that a tiny corner of Estonia be traversed in order to save several thousands of miles of an aroundthe-Baltic detour which would be necessitated if the bid were refused . It was a simple and reasonable request because Russia would handle the relay-running chore with its own nationals from border to border . Nothing doing , said the Russians for some obscure reason no one yet has figured out . The Finns merely shrugged their shoulders and planned a new route up over the Arctic Circle through Sweden to Finland and then down to Helsinki at the southern corner . While American preparations sped with sure-footed swiftness from a strictly athletic standpoint , they lagged most disconcertingly and alarmingly from a financial standpoint . Public response for donations to the Olympic fund was apathetic despite violent flag-waving that made the trip to Helsinki sound like a crusade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the sloganeers , so that they can beat the Russians . But a fortnight before the athletes were scheduled to depart the fund-raising was half a million dollars short of its goal of $850,000 . Then came a most remarkable occurrence . Bing Crosby and Bob Hope , perhaps the most sportsminded of all Hollywood stars , came galloping to the rescue . They agreed to act as joint masters of ceremony at a round-the-clock television show , the Olympic Telethon as they called it . These two amiable whacks would accept pledges in person as the entire entertainment world volunteered to appear on the show . Pledges rolled in at a fantastic rate under good-natured CrosbyHope prodding . Some fifteen hours after the Olympic Telethon had begun its attempt to raise a half million dollars the giant board on the stage revealed that $1,000,020 had been pledged . Do n't overlook that word " pledged . " Not every promise was a genuine or sincere one . Treasurer Owen Van Camp still was searching for funds when the first of five plane-loads of athletes departed . It later developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time he left Helsinki after the Games were over . But it also had moved out of the red and into the black before the treasurer had completed his journey back to the United States . Contributions trickled in for months afterwards to assure a surplus for 1956 and the Olympic Telethon is credited with direct raising of more than $350,000 , a rather high percentage for appeals of that type . On July 5 the Olympic flag was raised above the Olympic Village at Kapyla in simple ceremonies by Baron Erik von Frenckell , Mayor of Helsinki and chairman of the Organization Committee . On that identical day a freighter arrived unannounced in Helsinki harbor and the last doubt fled that Russia might not compete . The freighter brought twenty tight-lipped Soviet sailing competitors and their boats for the yachting races . Not until then did the rest of the world become aware of the fact that the Reds had brought a piece of the Iron Curtain with them . Instead of mingling with other athletes at the regular Olympic Village , the athletes from the Soviet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village at Otaniemi on the far side of town , enclosed by barbed wire and near the big Porkkala Naval Base that the Russians grabbed from the Finns in their peace settlement . The Russians were unapproachable . They spoke to no one and would n't even admit the Finns , their hosts , to their camp . Newspapermen , regardless of nationality , were turned away at the gates . Suddenly their icy reserve melted , presumably on orders from the Kremlin in a high-level change of policy . Although casual sightseers were barred , they freely gave admission passes to the press and other authorized visitors . Even American athletes wandered in to exchange pleasantries with their future rivals . They found them formally polite and not completely at ease in the presence of foreigners . Only the oarsmen seemed to approach true comaraderie and be free from restraints . When entries were formally filed for the Olympic competition , it was discovered that Heino Lipp , an Estonian shotputter who ranked with the world 's best , and several women world recordbreakers , were missing from the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically unreliable , " something new and unprecedented in Olympic history . Try as they might , however , the International Olympic Committee never could keep politics completely out of the Games . East Germany applied for recognition as a separate entity and the IOC contrived to sidle away from that by continuing its recognition of the West-Germans , who held the equivalent of the original Olympic " franchise . " China was different , though . Both Nationalist China and Red China held separate memberships in the various international federations and the original Chinese Olympic Committee was split in personnel into the two camps . The IOC stalled on this ticklish question until the Games were about to begin and then straddled the fence by accepting both . The aggrieved Nationalists thereupon withdrew in indignation , muttering that this step was highly illegal and improper . That left the field to Red China , a rather empty victory because the Communists did n't have any athletes on the premises anyway .  | While the International Olympic Committee was in session it elected a new president to succeed J. Sigfried Edstrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first American ever to achieve this distinction . Brundage was elected , 30 to 17 , over Lord Burghley of Britain , the Olympic 400-metre hurdles champion of 1928 , as most of his lordship 's support came , surprisingly enough , from the Iron Curtain countries . The formal opening of the Games was still five days away when the efficient Finns began to pare down the unwieldy fields in some of the competitions , principally basketball , soccer and fencing . Thus were many of the athletes finished as Olympic performers even before the Olympics themselves had properly begun . As the Games grew even closer the athletes grew more and more pessimistic in one regard . Most of them were agreed that the Helsinki track would defy record-breaking . Although the coppery dust-brick track had been completely rebuilt a fortnight before Opening Day , it was much too soft , they claimed , and the abnormal rains which had just descended made it even softer . Not a record could possibly be made . Once again a cynical observer must whisper : Oh , yeah ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day that the gallant and admirable Finns had dreamed about and yearned for ever since Werner Jaervinen , " the big Finn , " had given this indomitable little nation its first Olympic champion in 1906 . At long last this most wonderful of days had arrived , the day for the picturesque , breath-takingly beautiful Opening Ceremonies . And it rained ! Most mortified of all the people in the stadium were the members of the Organizing Committee . They had chosen this particular date because a study of Finnish weather reports for the past century have revealed that this was the most propitious date of them all . On Finland 's happiest of days the skies had to spoil the festivities by crying . Yet nothing , it seems , can dampen the spirit of these Finns . They came trooping out to the exquisite , modernistic stadium and jammed it to its 70,000 capacity , every one of them bubbling over with mystic fervor . Rain bounced off them unnoticed .  | Where the rain could n't help being noticed , however , was on the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parading feet of a record 5,780 athletes from a record total of sixty-seven nations ( Syria scratched at the last minute and Red China never did make it ) . Nor did the spiked heels of the gals help any , every heelprint being a direct stab into the groundkeeper 's heart . Long , long weeks of careful manicuring of the track were going for naught . It was truly a mess . At the moment , though . the Finns did n't care . They were gripped by their own rhapsodic emotions . Somehow or other the athletes still managed to look smart during the parade . In accordance with tradition they marched in alphabetical order except for Kreikka ( which is Greece in Finnish ) and Suomi ( which is Finland ) . The Greeks traditionally lead every parade as the founders of the Olympics and the host nation always is last . Next to last , it so happened , was Yhdysvallat . As every schoolboy should know ? or should he ? ? that 's merely the Finnish way of saying the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray slacks ( or skirts ) and white buckskin shoes that never would be the same again . The Russians were striding in white flannels , only their red ties hinting at their political beliefs . The Finnish spectators applauded them with reserved politeness . They lost their restraint , however , in giving a rousing reception to the Norwegians and to the Americans and finally to their own national heroes . When the parade was ended Juho K. Passikivi , the president of Finland , stepped to the microphone and spoke the magic sentence , " I proclaim open the Olympic Games of Helsinki , celebrating the fifteenth Olympiad of the modern era . " Quivers of excitement ran up and down the spines of the assembled Finns . The great moment had come . A cannon boomed in 21-gun salute , thousands of pigeons fluttered up on their release from cages to swoop symbolically over the massed athletes on the glistening green grass far below and the flame arrived . The Olympic flame had been lit originally in the Temple of Zeus on Olympia and carried by thousands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come across Europe , over the Baltic to Sweden and up over the Arctic Circle where Laplanders merged its fires with the fires they had lit by magnifying glass at the stroke of midnight , from the rays of the Midnight Sun . The Finns had known full well that the Olympic flame would be carried into the stadium to light the torch atop the peristyle . But well-kept was the secret as to who would carry it . Then out of the tunnel leaped a balding man with bounding stride . There were gasps of ecstatic delight from the spectators . It was Paavo Nurmi ! This was the crowning moment and the perfect touch for the emotion-drenched ( and rain-drenched ) Finns . For more than thirty years the Finns had worshipped at the shrine of the incomparable and immortal Nurmi , the greatest of their Olympic champions and record-breakers . His stride was still flawless , still flowing and still smooth as he bounded out of the tunnel in his old Olympic uniform with the torch upraised in his hand . The supposedly stolid Finns ? well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , they shrieked , they cried unashamedly . All the symbolism of the Olympics and all the prideful glory of Finland was personified by the bounding figure of the worldfamous Flying Finn . Around the water-soaked track ran this patron saint of Finnish athletics amid tumultuous scenes of rapturous delight from the stands . Nor were the athletes , massed on the field , able to control their excitement . They broke ranks and rushed to gaze in awe on one of the mightiest of all athletic gods . Nor were the Russians any exceptions . They were jumping up and down unrestrainedly to get a glimpse of him . Just short of one full lap of the track , Peerless Paavo came to a halt in front of the peristyle . He plunged the torch into the basin and flames shot up to blaze with unending brightness until the Games were formally closed . Then Nurmi handed his torch to the No. 2 god in the Finnish pantheon , old Hannes Kolehmainen , the first of the Flying Finns and a double Olympic winner in 1912 . Old Hannes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the greatest distance runner of his era . He  | bounced blithely up the steps to the top of the 272-foot tower which rose in its stark simplicity above the stadium . There he lit the second Olympic flame . Applause was thunderous . The spectators , limp to the exhaustion point by this emotional jamboree , sagged back in their seats in the pause which came before Heikki Savolainen , the veteran Finnish gymnast , solemnly took the Olympic oath for all the competitors . Suddenly there was an excited buzz , one caused by obvious puzzlement . A buxom , Junoesque woman in flowing white robes left her seat in the lower stands near the backstretch and began to run around the track in the direction of the platform where the Olympic dignitaries were gathered . Every part of the program had been run off in such letter-perfect fashion ? except for the non-cooperative weatherman ? that everyone supposed that the white-clad damsel naturally was a part of the pageantry , a bit of symbolism yet to be unfolded . Perhaps she was the spirit of victory or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in astonishment , each wondering if the other was attempting to top the surprise of the Nurmi appearance with some still-secret arrangement . She had run perhaps 300 yards when she reached the podium at the Tribune of Honor directly in front of President Paasikivi . Still slightly out of breath , she grabbed the microphone . " Friends , " she gasped in Finnish . That 's as far as she got . Horrified officials suddenly realized that she was n't part of the act . They grabbed for Juno , tugged her away from the microphone and hustled her unceremoniously off the platform before taking her to the police station for questioning and perhaps to the local psychopathic ward afterwards . No one ever did find out what eventually happened to her . It developed that she was Barbara Rotraut-Pleyer , a 23-year-old student from Stuttgart in West Germany and a fanatical peace idealist . She merely wanted to make an appeal for peace . Because the authorities had given her the brush-off in all her attempts to seek audience with them , she merely had taken matters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that she was a Communist who had  | attempted to use the Olympic Games as a sounding-board for the eternal Russian cry of " Peace . " As far as anyone could discover , though , she was not a Red and the Soviet was blameless for her appearance . But she made everyone uneasy for a while , fearful that more propaganda pyrotechnics might be attempted . The Finnish Organizing Committee was deeply chagrined and downright mad . To them she marred perfection . Yet this was only a minor blemish on that perfection . Even Juno and the weather could not take from the enthralled Finns the grandeur of the occasion . They gloried in every moment of it . By the time the athletes of sixty-seven nations had slogged out of the arena , though , the track resembled a hog wallow . Already considered too slow by the experts for any sort of record-breaking , the cinder path now looked too hopeless ever to be restored to its former sleekness . But nothing ever terrifies the Finns . They have been achieving the impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full stride . So masterful was the job they did in tidying up the track that not a cinder was out of place for the start of the track and field competition the following day , Sunday , July 20 . It was not to be an ordinary day for the simple reason that no session of this set of Olympic Games could be separated from any of the others . As valiantly as the International Olympic Committee had tried to disown and condemn any and all methods of compiling " team scoring , " it had been common newspaper practice to print such standings with points being awarded on a basis of 10 for first , 5 for second and then 4 , 3 , 2 and finally 1 for sixth . In the old days the United States was usually so far ahead in everything that it hardly was worth bothering about from an IOC standpoint . The authorities officially recognized only gold , silver and bronze medal-winners as individuals . If Americans wanted to pat themselves on the back for the folks at home by printing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worthy of formal or official frowns . But it was different this time . The Russians made it so . The Soviet had boasted long and loud about the high calibre of its athletes . Because it always has been Communist practice never to  | enter any endeavor deliberately unless it had more than a reasonably good chance of winning , the mere fact that Russia was represented at Helsinki indicated an overwhelming confidence . Never before were Olympic values so distorted . Instead of a great athletic carnival involving the athletes of sixty-seven nations , this had become in the eyes of the entire world a dual meet between the United States and the Soviet Union . Not for a moment did it ever escape from that unfortunate characterization . The U.S.A. vs . U.S.S.R. motif was set the very first day . It was a glorious day . Finlandia 's blue skies smiled serenely as a capacity crowd of 70,000 trooped happily out to the stadium , . there to find the running track impeccable . The first Olympic champion of 1952 did not win his medal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit and he won easily . Walter ( Buddy ) Davis , a 21-year-old giant from Texas A. and M. , justified his role as favorite by not only winning but by also setting a new Olympic record . Davis came a long way to achieve his magnificent success . He came all the way from the hospital bed of his childhood . Stricken by polio when he was an 8 year old , he turned to high jumping as a helpful exercise , little dreaming that it would bring him not only health but fame . The tallest high jumper ever to compete in the Olympics ? he stands 6-foot-8 and weighs 205 pounds ? the tall Texan twisted over the bar a fraction over his own height at 6 feet 85/ 6 inches for a new Olympic record . He tried earnestly to boost this another inch but five and a half hours of competition , he confessed , " shore tuckered me out . " Not only did this altitudinous Texan , who also is a crack basketball center , win for the United States but Ken Wiesner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This onetwo sweep , which was expected but unattained four years before at London , was a most auspicious start . While Davis was still jumping industriously away in an effort to add to his new Olympic record , the 10,000-metre run got under way with an unwieldy field of thirty-three starters . It was so un-  | wieldy that they had to jam up into two rows and the mad rush for the first turn looked like the charge of the Light Brigade . In the second row and with his hands clutched tightly against his chest as though he already were in agony was Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia , the defending champion . The experts were a bit dubious about the bouncing Czech . He had been ailing for most of the spring and shortly before the Olympics he was beaten in a fast 5,000-metre race by Vladimir Kazantsev , the Russian star distance performer who was to be the overwhelming favorite to win the 3,000-metre steeplechase . However , it was another Russian , Aleksandr Anoufriev , the Siberian strong man , who was deemed his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch for Alain Mimoun-o-Kacha , the French Algerian who had been his runner-up at London . The only thing that lent an element of doubt to this race was the state of Zatopek 's health . If he 'd been blooming with vigor , victory would have been conceded to him in advance . But no one in the crowd knew his true condition except Zatopek himself and he was n't talking . Nor does it help any to look at him . The Czech Army captain runs with his face contorted in agony , hand clutched to heart as though in the last stages of an angina pectoris seizure . Every step seems to be his last . He dies , so to speak , from start to finish . The ambulatory Zatopek deathbed never moved to the head of the procession until the backstretch of the sixth lap . But then Walter Pirie , a 21-year-old bank clerk from Britain , came galloping past as if the bank adjusters had just found a shortage in his accounts . He overhauled the bouncing Czech and regained the lead from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't examine too critically . The grotesquely nicknamed Beast of Prague whisked past Pirie once more and was never headed again . That did n't mean , however , that Zatopek was free from pursuit . For mile after mile of this approximately six-mile affair Mimoun , the Algerian , hung on grimly . Pirie stayed with them for fifteen laps and then began to fade . There were no new challengers to take his place . Zatopek was still dying all over the track , face contorted in  | anguish , as he reached the nineteenth lap . It was then that he decided to dispose of Mimoun . He poured on the speed until his ungainly body seemed about to burst at the seams in some sort of inner explosion . The Algerian tried hard but it was no use . No human could run at so killing a pace . Zatopek is n't human . He 's a running machine . He opened up fifty yards on his chief pursuer . The Finns , who had been looking at the greatest of all distance runners all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kolehmainen in their palmiest days were n't in the Czech 's class . But when the bell sounded for the last lap , they got even more pop-eyed . Zatopek sprinted in earnest and won by a hundred yards . His time ? It just had to be a record . It was . The 30-year-old Army captain was timed in 29 minutes and 17 seconds , thus slicing the incredible chunk of 42.6 seconds off the Olympic record he had set in London four years previously . But Emil was n't a bit happy about it . " I was disappointed in my time , " he said . " I was not fast . It was not a very good run . I have done better . " What does he want ? jet propulsion ? The bouncing Czech spread-eagled the field so badly that the others were strung out far behind . Yet he 'd pulled them all along at so giddy a pace that all first six finishers were under Zatopek 's former Olympic record of 29:59.6-Mimoun of France , Aleksandr Anoufriev of Russia , Hannu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Nystrom of Sweden . The Americans were completely outclassed as expected , Curt Stone and Fred Wilt finished twentieth and twenty-first . The most significant part of the 10,000 , outside of Zatopek 's stunning victory , was the third place finish of Anoufriev . The Siberian strong man thus became the first point-scorer and first medal-winner ever credited to Russia in the Olympics . But it was n't long before the Reds had leaped ahead from that initial take-off . The women 's discus competition was held and firm was the belief that the Amazons from the Soviet would sweep everything in sight on the distaff side . They did . Three stalwart Amazons from the steppes , each built  | like a tackle on the Chicago Bears , scaled the Hellenic platter for all three medals . The winner was Nina Romaschkova with a new Olympic record of 168 feet 8.845 inches . Ordinarily no one pays much attention to women 's track and field performances , especially reporters . But the dual meet overtones of this Olympic Games yanked the gals into the headlines . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the U.S.S.R. was ahead of the U.S.A. , 23 points to 15 . The three finals had produced three records , not bad for a layout which was n't supposed to produce any . Yet that was n't all the record-breaking for the day . Charlie Moore , a Cornell graduate from the New York Athletic Club , eased up in the homestretch of a 400-metre hurdles heat but still broke the Olympic mark . With a glittering 50.8 seconds he shattered Roy Cochran 's 51.1 clocking which had been posted at London . The second day of track competition was not a particularly nice day . The track was hit by both rain and hail in the morning . By the time of the afternoon finals the racing strip was dull and soggy . Presumably that again eliminated a chance of record-making although the experts were already beginning to distrust their own presumptions . The big race of the day was to be the 100-metre final , a test which automatically carries with it the distinction of producing " The World 's Fastest Human . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite . In every preceding Olympics the Americans always produced at least one favorite and occasionally co-favorites . That they did n't always win is beside the point . They were the marked men . However , the two best 100-metre men in the world were n't even on the premises . One was Jim Golliday of Northwestern who broke down with pulled muscles in training and did n't even make the team . The other was Andy Stanfield of Seton Hall , an oversize Jesse Owens with the same speed , smoothness and power . But Stanfield had been so plagued by a series of muscle injuries over a span of years that he passed up the 100 and concentrated on the 200 , qualifying for one sprint instead of two .  | That left the United States without a Man of Distinction . Our best was Arthur Bragg of Morgan State College , rated a shade better than Dean Smith of Texas and the San Antonio A.C. Oh , yes . The third man , the forgotten man , was Lindy Remigino of Manhattan College . Who was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a relay runner on Manhattan 's wondrously fast sprint relay team . He was n't the best man on that team , either . So discouraged was he at his lack of success as a sprinter that he was ready to quit the track team in disgust three months before the Olympics . Only the persistent coaxing of George Eastment , his coach , kept him in circulation . A bit to his surprise the 21-year-old native from the sidewalks of New York found himself in the Olympic 100-metre final . It hardly ranked as the swiftest field of finalists ever assembled . Herb McKenley of Jamaica had judged its calibre shrewdly . McKenley , you might remember , was the odds-on favorite to win the 400 at London in 1948 . He finished second . He also took a fling at the 200 where he finished fourth . But this time Hustling Herbert shot for an unprecedented double . He had originally been a sprinter when he came to Boston College from Jamaica . However , at both Boston College and at the University of Illinois he established himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the possibilities in the various events at his Bronx home near the Yankee Stadium , he reached a decision . The century , he concluded , was " the easiest event in the Olympics . " There would n't be a standout in it . So he entered it himself , a flexibility of choice possible for little Jamaica , which held no tryouts , but impossible for big America , which did . Hustling Herbert sure knew what he was doing . In one semifinal MacDonald Bailey of Great Britain beat Dean Smith of the United States as Arthur Bragg pulled a muscle and was eliminated . In the other semi-final McKenley beat Lindy Remigino . Obviously the final would be a wide-open race . It was . Remigino was off flying . The Young Man of Manhattan churned down the soggy track at the crack of the gun , leaving McKenley and Bailey at the post . That fast start was to be most  | important . The Jamaican and the Briton flashed after him with such speed that they steadily cut into his lead . Twenty yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fast-disappearing yard with the long-legged McKenley coming on like a whippet . Hustling Herbert was still coming at the tape . He lunged for it . Lindy thrust out his chest . They hit almost simultaneously . A foot beyond the finish line McKenley definitely was in front . But where was he at the finish line itself ? Only the phototimer could tell . Bravely swallowing his disappointment , the heartsick Remigino walked over to McKenley and congratulated him . They were still having their pictures taken when someone rushed over to Lindy and whispered in his ear that the photo-timer had seen it differently The Young Man of Manhattan was most apologetic as he approached McKenley once more . " Gee , Herb , " he said , almost mournfully , " it looks as though I won . " Remigino sat in stunned disbelief in his dressing-room long afterwards as interviewers descended upon him en masse . There probably never was a more modest Olympic champion . Someone asked him how it felt to be the World 's Fastest Human . " Are you kidding ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not even the best sprinter we have . If Golliday and Stanfield had been in this race , I would n't even be here . " Remigino was the Cinderella of the 1952 Olympics and the nicest part about it was that the witching hour of midnight never struck for him . The winning time of 10.4 seconds was just ordinary as McKenley of Jamaica took second , Bailey of Britain third , Dean Smith of the United States fourth , Vladimir Soukharev of Russia fifth and John Treloar of Australia sixth . The broad jump furnished just as great a surprise . The overwhelming favorite was George Brown of U.C.L.A. , the only 26-footer in the Olympics . Twice he fouled and on his third leap he overstepped the take-off board by inches for what was the longest jump of the day . The announcement that he 'd fouled out came  | booming through the loudspeakers just as he crashed into the loam pit , his dream castle crashing down there with him . He lay there for a minute , too broken in spirit to arise . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanfare of the Olympic victory ceremony . It was for Remigino to mount the pedestal . It rang mockingly and hollowly in Brown 's ears . Remigino who could n't possibly win an Olympic championship had won one . Brown , who could n't possibly lose , had lost . But that broad jump title still stayed in the family . Jerome Biffle , an Army private from Denver University who had been retired from competition for two years , triumphed at 24 feet 10.03 inches . The runner-up for a Small Slam was Cornell 's Meredith Gourine . The two Americans were well in front of the other place winners , Oedoen Foeldesi of Hungary , Ary Facanha de Sa of Brazil , Jorma Valtonen of Finland and Leonid Grigorjev of Russia . In the shotput , though , the United States achieved a Grand Slam with a 1-2-3 placing . Parry O'Brien , a curly-haired , blue-eyed , 20-year-old giant from Southern California , broke the Olympic record with a toss of 57 feet 1 V2 inches . Another 20-year-old giant from Texas A. and M. , Darrow Hooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inch . The ailing world recordholder , Jim Fuchs of Yale and the New York A.C. , took third , well ahead of Otto Grigalka of the persistent Russians . Another Russian was to be a prime surprise in the 400-metre hurdles final . He gave the favored Moore a bitter fight . The powerfully built Moore had never been defeated in this event . He was , so to speak , bred for it . His father , Crip Moore , had been a 1924 Olympian and he pointed his son at the Olympic goal that he himself had missed . The Cornell alumnus was unlucky in drawing the outside lane where the soggy track was heaviest and where he could see no rivals in the staggered start . At the third hurdle he took the lead . His first real challenger was John Holland of New Zealand . Moore fought him off . His next challenger was Yuri Lituyev of the Soviet . He was tougher . He hung on , two yards back , at the last hurdle when Charlie poured it on to win by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Olympic record that  | Moore had established the day before . On a faster track he could n't have missed a world record . Not only did Lituev take second ahead of Holland , the New Zealander , but another Russian , Anatoli Julin , was fourth . A Britisher and an Italian took the other places . Americans figured that they 'd swept the day with the victories by Remigino , Biflle , O'Brien and Moore . Technically , they did n't because Giuseppe Dordoni of Italy set a new world and Olympic record in the 50,000-metre walk with a mark of 4 hours , 28 minutes and 7.8 seconds . The unexpectedly fine balance of the Russians was demonstrated by their taking fifth and sixth behind a Czech , a Hungarian and the Briton . Newspaper headlines the next day emblazoned the news that America had " wrested the lead from Russia , " 72 points to 40 . But one day later they sang a different tune as the Soviet went in front , there to stay up to the final day . Truly had this become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and condemn it as Olympic officials did with ever-increasing vehemence . As far as the track and field phase of the competition ? this is the heart and soul of the Olympic Games ? was concerned , however , it was no contest . The Americans already had exceeded early expectations . Even at his most optimistic moment , Brutus Hamilton , the head coach of the U.S. track team , did n't dare hope for more than eleven championships as the absolute maximum . But before the third day was over the United States had won eight of the ten men 's crowns and was rolling along in high gear . That third day was a pleasant one which drew 65,000 spectators to the arena and it carried plenty of drama of its own . Once again records were shattered all over the joint . The feature was the 800-metre final with Mal Whitfield , the sleek-striding Air Force sergeant from the Lockbourne base in Columbus , Ohio , defending the championship he won at London . In the four years between Olympic Games life changed for Whitfield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail gunner on a bomber over Korea . But his pattern of running did n't change a bit . The man obviously was in a rut . At London Whitfield defeated Arthur Wint , the giant from Jamaica , in 1:49.2 , a new Olympic record .  | At Helsinki Whitfield defeated Arthur Wint , the giant from Jamaica , in 1:49.2 , a new Olympic record . Oh , well , maybe the record was n't so new in 1952 . But his clocking at least equaled the old figures of 1948 , which still is a pretty good trick . This was a beautifully run race , plotted by the highly intelligent Whitfield with uncanny exactitude . He miscalculated only in the early pace . Yet that was n't his fault . He had expected that Heinz Ulzheimer , the swift-moving German , would blaze a swift early pace . But he did n't . It was a slowish 54 seconds for the initial quarter Serenely confidently , Whitfield eased snugly into last place at the start , letting the others do the scrambling and the work . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first lap and slipped into a tranquil third behind Ulzheimer and Wint at the 400-metre halfway mark . In the middle of the backstretch he fled past the German with so invincible a surge that he also collared the huge Wint just before the final curve was reached . They both fought back furiously as the three whirled into the homestretch . But Whitfield , silkenly-smooth in his striding , always had something extra . When the 6-foot-4 Wint charged up to within a yard of the Air Force sergeant , Whitfield gave with a burst of his jets and made it a safe two yards . The track was heavy , he was fighting a headwind in the stretch and he had a long series of 400-metre and relay heats ahead of him . Victory was the important thing , not a record . So Whitfield watched Wint out of the corner of his eye as the tape approached , giving just enough of himself to win with reasonable comfort . That he should equal his own record under circumstances such as this was ample testimony of his greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled over on the turf in mountainous weariness . Ulzheimer just collapsed into the infield . The other scorers ? Gunnar Nielsen of Denmark , Albert Webster of Britain and Guenther Steines of Germany ? were all in sad states of disrepair . Whitfield smilingly relaxed on the turf , hands folded under his head and feet up on a campstool , perfectly at peace with the world .  | There even was drama in the discus throw , for a change . Adolfo Consolini of Italy , a teen-age competitor at Berlin in 1936 but the defending champion after London in 1948 , responded nobly to the challenge . Twice the Italian veteran broke his own Olympic record of 173 feet 2 inches with a best of 176 feet 5 inches . It was n't enough . Sim Iness , built like a California redwood tree , broke the old Olympic record every time he scaled the platter , six times in all . Iness stands 6-foot-6 and weighs 240 pounds . He had a superlatively successful track season at the University of Southern California and he was still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate 180 feet 6 inches for a new Olympic mark . About all that Consolini achieved was to split the Americans and prevent another Grand Slam . As it was Jim Dillon , a giant from Auburn , broke the old Olympic record and could finish no better than third . Fortune Gordien , ex-Minnesota , just missed the old mark in taking fourth . A Hungarian and another of those persistent Russians took the two remaining places . Most dramatic of the field events , perhaps , was the pole vault . The United States had the only 15-footers in the meet , the Rev. Bob Richards and Lon Laz . Because the Vaulting Vicar has been the world 's most consistent performer , he was the natural favorite with Laz rated for runner-up honors . It was an awfully tight fit . Considering the fact that only Japan ever has been able to challenge America in this event during the past quarter century , there was some quite remarkable vaulting by the Europeans . The Olympic record of 14 feet 3 % inches had been set by Earle Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That mark survived all assaults until the boys went to work on it in earnest at Helsinki . The bar went up to 14 feet 5 inches . It was expected that both Richards and Laz would clear it . They did . But it was not expected that anyone else would clear it . However , Ragnar Lundberg of Sweden whisked over the crosspiece as pretty as you please amid low whistles of astonishment from the press box pundits . Those low whistles soon turned to fullthroated roars of disbelief , though , when Peter Denisenko of Russia also twisted over the bar . A Russian , of all people , had also  | broken the old Olympic record in the trickiest and most technically involved event of them all . Yet before the Americans in the crowd could get too apprehensive , the bar was boosted to 14 feet 9% inches and that was to prove a mite too high for the two finest vaulters that Europe has yet produced . Both of them missed with Lundberg awarded third place over Denisenko on the basis of fewer misses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once , oddly enough , teammates of the University of Illinois . Each cleared the 14:9 ' ' % and up went the bar to 14 feet 11.14 inches . Each failed on his first try . Each failed on his second try . Laz failed on his third and that left the issue completely up to Richards on his last leap . The Vaulting Vicar , a 26-year-old teacher and minister , came thundering down the runway , sailed up , twisted clear and plummeted into the sawdust pit below . No sooner had he landed than he glanced up anxiously at the cross-piece . It was still resting on the pegs . Richards was the Olympic champion . The reaction was as though someone had just given him a hotfoot . He leaped up , screaming . In a transport of ecstatic joy Richards jumped and danced in the pit , hands flung over his head . He bolted down the runway , leaping into the air every few strides with a happy skip . He blew kisses at the crowd . Suddenly blocking his path was Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score . Perhaps he 'll be exiled to Siberia for what he did but the Red athlete just could n't help himself , so great was his admiration . The Soviet vaulter embraced Richards in a bear hug and lifted him as high as he could . The attempt of the Rev. Robert to become the first 15-footer in Olympic history was strictly anti-climactic . They raised the bar a fraction above the magic height for him . But four hours and a half of unexpectedly rugged competition had taken its toll . He failed and for the first time in his life he did n't care . The main objective had been reached . He had won an Olympic championship . There was one other final , the women 's 100-metre dash . It was won by Marjorie Jackson , a 20-year-old typist from Australia . She equaled the world and Olympic record of 11.5 seconds in both  | semi-final and final . An American girl , Mae Faggs , took sixth place and the Amazons from the Soviet did n't score at all . The most noteworthy occurrence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5,000-metres . Emil Zatopek , winner of the 10,000 metres and favorite to achieve the Woolworth double ( the 5 and 10 ) , led into the last lap of his preliminary after alternating in the pace-setting chores with Aleksander Anoufriev of the Soviet . As the bouncing Czech neared the finish line , he made a longrange obeisance to Stalin , Lenin and other gods in his Communist pantheon . He imperiously summoned the Siberian to pass him and then lagged behind to serve as traffic cop , flagging down Bertil Albertson , the blond Swede . They chatted pleasantly as they jogged the rest of the way . The Siberian shook Zatopek 's hand warmly afterwards and thanked him profusely . More important , perhaps , was another heat where Herbert Schade , a curly-haired mite of a German , did 14 minutes 15.4 seconds to break the Olympic record by more than two seconds . Ordinarily no one pays the slightest attention to any phase of the Olympics until the track and field events are completed . But this was no ordinary Olympics . The Russian soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , had come from far behind in the closing minutes of a game a few days previously to gain a 5-5 tie with the hated Yugoslavians . This news was heralded triumphantly from Bucharest to Vladivostock . But on this day the crack Red booters were eliminated , 3 to 1 , by pro-Communist but anti-Russian Yugoslavia to give the Soviet its most bitter disappointment of the Games . However , the Russian gal gymnasts suddenly bobbed up with 601/2 points to none for the United States . Ordinarily that feat would have caught no one 's eye . This time it caught the headlines because it indicated to gullible readers that the Soviet was leading . America in total points , 1371/2 to 115 . This condition was to get worse . The next day the unofficial totals were 266%Z for Russia and 202 for the United States . The entire world was beginning to take notice and the Reds , reluctant  | at first to believe their good fortune , cautiously let the news leak into their controlled press . It was an astounding and uncomfortable situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Reds were scoring in the minor leagues . A Kitty League team had become of equal importance to the Brooklyn Dodgers . Yet the American Olympic team continued to enjoy that unprecedented success . In fact it began to get slightly ridiculous by the time the fourth day of competition was completed on Wednesday . Three men 's finals were scheduled and the Star Spangled heroes were given a chance to win only one . That was the 200-metre sprint . The favorite was Andy Stanfield of Seton Hall University in New Jersey , who has been described as " tall , tan and terrific . " A few years ago it had seemed as though the mantle of Jesse Owens was his for the asking as a triple Olympic champion . He runs with the same effortless ease , gliding rather than running over the cinders . However , a crippling injury jinx dogged his footsteps as he repeatedly pulled muscles in his legs . He quit broadjumping and for the Olympic year decided to quit the 100 as well . If he became too greedy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reasoned well . The 200-metre final was held before a thrilled crowd of 70,000 on a soggy track under bleak and dripping skies . It made folks wonder what Stanfield might have done if he had had his full health . The powerhouse runner , moving with fluid drive , never was headed as he streaked over that heavy path in a dazzling 20.7 seconds to equal the Olympic record which the fabulous Owens had set in Berlin . He finished , glancing behind him in the hope that his two teammates , Thane Baker of Kansas State and Jim Gathers of the Air Force and Boys High in Brooklyn , would make a sweep of it . They did . Thus did the United States make another Grand Slam . That , it was supposed , finished us for the day . Admittedly , we had the best javelin throwers in our history and yet we never have been in the class with the Europeans , especially the Scandinavians . The favorite was Toivo Hyytianen of Finland  | and the large crowd was attracted in the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympics began to take on aspects of the ridiculous and an air of unreality . Never had an American won the javelin or even come close except for a surprise second in 1948 . And along came Cy Young to give himself the nicest of all birthday presents on this his twenty-fourth birthday . He 's a rancher from Modesto , California , and a most massive man , 6-foot-5 and a solid 220 pounds . He won the event but made the winning of it totally implausable by hurling the spear a distance of 242 feet to break the Olympic record . The fans were still rubbing their eyes in disbelief when Bill Miller , a Marine from Phoenix , just missed the old mark himself but took second place for a completely undreamed of 1-2 Small Slam . Hyytianen , the Finnish favorite , took third but highly significant was the fact that Russia came through with a fourth and a sixth . In many respects this was to be a record day in Olympic annals . It is to be doubted if there ever were more made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale lots . The chief wholesaler appeared to be Adhemar Ferreira da Silva from Brazil . A colorful performer in his eye-catching uniform of yellow shirt and green pants , he caught all eyes as he thundered down the runway in the hop , step and jump . Six times he took off into space and four times he broke the world record . He finally left the mark at 53 feet 2.59 inches . Then he jogged around the track , waving his victory bouquet at the fascinated , cheering customers . The fellow he beat for the gold medal was Leonid Scherbakov of the Soviet , who certainly turned in an amazing performance for a relatively inexperienced triple-jumper . He did 52 feet 5.14 inches , less than an inch under the old record . The United States , which never did well in this event , finished fourth with Walter Ashbaugh , the ex-Cornell man . The gal broad jumpers warmed up in the preliminary round by thoroughly dislocating the Olympic record . Then the damsels really let go in the final . Yvette Williams of New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet 5% inches as  | all six place scorers went sailing past the old standard . One Russian Amazon was second and another tied for fifth . There were lots of feminine shrieks to be heard after the times were announced for 80-metre hurdles preliminaries and semi-finals ( female division ) . This gets a little involved . So please listen carefully In the qualifying round Shirley Strickland de la Hunty equaled the world record and broke the Olympic record ; Marija Golubichnaja of Russia broke the Olympic record ; Fanny Blankers-Koen of Holland , the " Marvelous Mamma " of the 1948 Games , equaled the Olympic record . Then in one semi-final the first three qualifiers broke the world record ; the fourth qualifier broke the Olympic record and the fifth qualifier tied the Olympic record . Got it ? The Australian doll with the long name remained best with 10.8 seconds . The real hurdlers ( masculine division ) also began operations . If you turn your mind back to 1948 , you will recall that Harrison Dillard of Baldwin-Wallace College , the world 's greatest hurdler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurdler but did qualify for the last place as a 100-metre sprinter . And then , in the most stunning surprise of the Games , Dillard , who was in there on a rain-check , won the 100-metre championship . In 1952 Dillard decided to cash in his rain-check . He made the team as a hurdler . Then in his very first heat and without going all out , he fled over the sticks in 13.9 seconds to equal the Olympic record . The qualifying trials in the 3,000-metre steeplechase were not expected to produce very much except to furnish a glimpse at Vladimir Kasantsev of the Soviet , the overwhelming favorite for the only Olympic championship the Russians could be positive of winning . He once covered the route in 8:48.6 , which is the equivalent of a world record and almost borders on the impossible . Kasantsev , tall and strong , ran in powerhouse fashion and lived up to his press clippings . He shattered the Olympic record with an easy , unpressed 8:58 first heat . That set the tempo as eight of the twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievable of these qualifiers was Horace Ashenfelter , a 29-year-  | old F.B.I . agent who graduated from Penn State and currently was running for the New York Athletic Club . Although no American in history had ever beaten nine minutes , Ashenfelter stunned everyone with an 8:51 performance which promptly broke Kasantsev 's brand-new Olympic record . Not all the excitement was contained in the Olympic Stadium , however . The rowing course was alive with activity . The crack eight-oared shell from the U.S. Naval Academy , smartly coached by Rusty Callow , won by open water . But ahead of Australia , Great Britain and Germany , all with deep rowing traditions , came a Russian shell whose oarsmen had not the foggiest notions as to proper technique . They did it on brute strength . So green were they at this thing that they did n't even know enough to peel off their shirts and present them to the winning crew , a custom as old as the sport itself . The race rated second in importance to the eight-oared shells is the single sculls . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The winner was Jurij Tjukalov , a Russian , who outstroked the defending champion , Mervyn Wood of Australia , as unexpected a result as the Olympics were to produce . The United States did score , much to its surprise , in the pairs without coxswain . A little-regarded pair from Rutgers did the winning , Chuck Logg , Jr. , son of the Rutgers coach , and Tom Price . The next day was mild and balmy ? in Finland , that is . In the United States it was just balmy as newspaper headlines screamed : " Russia leads U.S. by 102 %2 points . " The Soviet had shut us out in gymnastics , 188 points to zero , and the unofficial point tabulation , which was irritating Olympic authorities more and more , stood at 323 ' /2 points for the U.S.S.R. and 221 for the U.S.A. at the end of the sixth day of competition . Performances matched the wonderful weather and the wonderful crowd of 70,000 capacity . It had poured out mainly to see Zatopek , the Czechoslovakian crowd-pleaser , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eluded him at London . He made the 10 then but missed the 5 as Gaston Reiff of Belgium held him off to the wire .  | Once again it looked as though the bouncing Czech had overreached himself . His opposition was overwhelmingly strong and fleet . There was Reiff , the defending champion ; Schade , the German who had set an Olympic record in qualifying ; Anoufriev , the pride of Siberia ( if Siberians have any pride ) ; Mimoun , the French Algerian , who was his runner-up in the 10,000 ; Pirie , the British bank clerk who had been so bothersome in the 10,000 ; Christopher Chataway , a red-head from Oxford and others . Although Schade handled most of the pace-setting chores , this was primarily a jockeying duel . Five times the tortured and tormented Beast of Prague , face grimaced with pain , bolted into the lead . Every time he 'd lose it , he would seem to falter as if the pressure of that excruciating pace had killed him off . It killed off Reiff , the defender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , exhausted . Zatopek 's last big spurt came at the start of the final lap . He flashed into the lead and appeared to draw the other contenders right with him as if they were puppets on a string yanked by a madman . In the backstretch of the last lap , some 200 metres from home , the madman looked done . Schade flashed past him . So did Chataway . So did Mimoun . The grotesque , contorted wreck in the red jersey was done , three faltering yards behind the sleeker-moving leaders . They rushed into the curve at the end of the backstretch and Chataway , noted for his strong finishing drive , overhauled Schade to take command . This appeared to infuriate the Czech . He exploded past Mimoun , past Schade and past Chataway . The Oxonian tried gamely to match his human sprinting ability against Zatopek 's inhuman self-flagellation . He wavered under the strain , stepped on the curbing and fell . He picked himself up and was lucky to finish fifth . The bouncing Czech defied all laws of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He won by four yards from Mimoun , with Schade third . He broke the Olympic record with a breathtaking 14:06 performance as both Mimoun and Schade were under the old mark themselves . The 110-metre hurdles final followed the script with infinitely  | more saneness and exactitude . Only Zatopek does things in implausible , exaggerated , super-dramatic fashion . Harrison Dillard reached the starting line , ready to cash in the rain-check he 'd been treasuring for four long years . Yet the world 's greatest hurdler had to go all out in order to cash it . Jack Davis , a 21-year-old Texas-born undergraduate at Southern California , stayed with Dillard until the last hurdle . He nicked that barrier slightly and that was it . Dillard , clearing the sticks flawlessly , triumphed over Davis by a yard with Art Barnard , Southern Cal graduate in the Navy , a yard further back for a 1-2-3 Grand Slam . The winning time was 13.7 seconds for a new Olympic record while a separate set of watches caught Davis in the identical figures even though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record also went in the final of the women 's 80-metre hurdles as Shirley Strickland de la Hunty of Australia did 10.9 seconds which broke all records except the 10.8 she 'd turned in the day before . There was a record in the heats for the 10,000-metre walk as Bruno Junk of Russia was clocked in 45:05.8 . The hammer throwers not only sent their weighted balls crashing into the turf . They sent them crashing into the record book . The unexpected star of this show was Josef Csemak , a 20-year-old Hungarian powerhouse , who obviously had been well schooled by Imry Nemeth , Hungary 's defending champion . The big youngster broke Nemeth 's world record by almost eighteen inches with a titanic heave of 197 feet 11 inches . He also broke by more than twelve feet Karl Hein 's Olympic mark . In fact , he did that four times in all . The runner-up was Karl Storch of Germany , the co-favorite with Nemeth , who had to be satisfied with third place . The United States did not score but well-balanced Russia did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake on this amazing day of amazing record-breaking , the women 's javelin throw . It was to be something out of Hollywood or perhaps dreamed up at a fiction writers ' convention as the most preposterous romantic plot of all time . Naturally , it had to involve Zatopek , a totally implausible fellow anyway .  | Not long after Emil had scored his unbelievable victory in the 5,000 , a solidly-built hausfrau in Czechoslovakia 's red uniform let fly with the spear 165 feet 7 inches for a new Olympic record , almost twenty feet further than she 'd ever tossed the thing before in her life . This whisked the Olympic championships right away from the three Amazons from the steppes who 'd expected to fight for the prize themselves . Instead , they finished second , third and fourth . Who was the winner ? Do n't bother trying to answer because you 'd never guess in a million years . Naturally enough , she was Mrs. Emil Zatopkova , wife of the distance-running marvel . They had been fellow Olympians at London when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Zatopkova she could n't miss . The boys in the press box , intrigued by the first husband-andwife Olympic bracketing , fought off temptation for a while but eventually succumbed . They referred to them as " Czech and double Czech . " Credulity already had been strained to the breaking point by the time the sixth day rolled around before a gathering of 60,000 . Then it got worse , almost beyond the breaking point . The 3,000-metre steeplechase was responsible for this touch of utter insanity . There was no doubt as to who the winner would be . He would be Kazantsev , the Russian . No one questioned that . But the trial heat performance of Ashenfelter had aroused a lot of curiosity . A week before the Olympics none conceded him much chance of placing . After his record-breaking feat in the trials , however , the feeling had grown that he might even take second to his more polished and experienced Soviet foe . Horace was a bit new at the dodge . He 'd been a distance runner of no distinction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar event that has hurdles artfully strewn about the turf course . Most wicked of the barriers is the brush-covered one which rests on the edge of the moat . This is the water jump , knee-high on the inside of the pit and graded upwards for ten or a dozen feet . No matter how adroit he is , a steeplechaser ca n't help getting his tootsies wet .  | The distance of 3,000 metres is slightly less than two miles . The further he runs the higher the hurdles seem to get . By the time he reaches the water jump on the very last lap , the obstacle looks as formidable as scaling Mount Everest and then plummeting into the Niagara Gorge . It is a most exhausting race . Being an F.B.I . man , Ashenfelter was soundly schooled to be both inquisitive and observant . One day at the training track he watched Olavi Rinteenpam , a friendly Finn whom Americans affectionately dubbed Rin-Tin-Tin . The Finns have always been the best steeplechasers and know the intricacies of the event better than most . Rinteenpam explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump was all wrong . Our lads hurdled the barrier and plunked into the drink where it was deepest , a tiring and time-consuming method . The best way , he said , was to leap to the top of the barrier with one foot and then push off with a jump into the shallowest part of the pit . It conserved precious energy and precious seconds . That 's just the way Ashenfelter rehearsed for the Olympics . He 's a formful runner with wiry frame , 5-foot-10 but only 140 pounds . It was obvious from the beginning of the race that Kazantsev had decided that willowy Horace was the man he had to beat . He remained behind him all the way , even when the F.B.I . man lagged well back at the opening gun . What progress was made in picking up stragglers was made together . It certainly was a switch from what we 'd grown to expect on this side of the water . Instead of the normal " F.B.I . man trails Communist " it had become " Communist trails F.B.I . man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invincible Kazantsev made his bid . He surged past J. Edgar Hoover 's Special Agent and into the lead . It was all over . Oddly enough , Americans did n't feel too badly about this denouement . Ashenfelter had done nobly in getting even that close . However , Horace held on doggedly as they approached the last big jump , the water jump . Then he remembered Rinteenpam 's instructions as vividly as he ever was to remember anything in his life . Rhythmically he strode into the barrier , gauging his step per-  | fectly . He took off with his left foot and his right foot landed atop the barrier . Strongly he pushed off , landing with his left foot on the shallow outer edge of the water . Immediately he was in full stride . Kazantsev hit the water and lost both his rhythm and self-possession . He had to scramble to get out . Dark was his despair when he looked up to see the decadent capitalist a full five yards in front and flying . The incredible Ashenfelter then sprinted incredibly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beating the supposedly invincible Russian by thirty yards and breaking Kazantsev 's new record of 8:58 . The Soviet ace barely saved second place from England 's , fast-closing John Disley as all six place-winners were caught under Volmair Iso-Hollo 's old Olympic mark of 9:03.8 . This was the stunner of stunners . Nothing in this entire Olympic Games could take precedence over Ashenfelter 's most astounding feat . There was one other final on this bleak , threatening and chilly day . It was the 400-metre test where Mal Whitfield , the 800-metre winner , was shooting for the same double which had eluded him in London . The Air Force sergeant , bogged down by a head cold , never was a factor . He started dully , ran dully and finished dully in sixth and last place . Even at that , though , he was not much worse than Arthur Wint , the London medical student from Jamaica , who faded to fifth in defense of his Olympic championship behind Karl Haas of Germany . Up ahead it was a rousing battle between two American-trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tall and spindle-legged graduate from Morgan State , and the other was Herb McKenley , the hard-luck loser to Wint in the 400 four years previously and the hard-luck photo-finish loser to Remigino in the 100 a few days previously . Hustling Herbert gave it a brave try although Rhoden had definitely succeeded him as the world 's fastest quarter-miler since London . Rhoden roared into the lead at the gun and was never headed . McKenley gained ground steadily but could n't gain quite  | enough . He finished a yard behind Rhoden but some five yards in front of 011ie Matson , the 200-pound fullback wonder of the University of San Francisco football team . A quirk in timing gave the same clocking to Rhoden and to McKenley , manifestly impossible as this must be . However , Rhoden 's time , being the only one which counts officially , was a brilliant 45.9 seconds for a new Olympic record , three-tenths under the old figures . Records also went by the boards in the women 's 200-metre dash trials . Nadezhda Khnykina of Russia set a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than five minutes . Marjorie Jackson of Australia , the 100-metre winner , did 23.6 for a new Olympic standard , time that also equaled the world record . That lasted less than an hour . In her semi-final race the 20-year-old typist from New South Wales was caught in 23.4 for a new world 's record . Long before any of these contestants had begun operations and long after they had finished their chores for the day , the gruelling and all-important decathlon competition was grinding away . Not until well into the evening , ten hours after it had started , did they finish the first five events of this ten-event supreme test of versatility The favorite was the old man of the competition , the defending champion from the London Olympics , Bob Mathias . This graybearded ancient was now a senile 21 years of age . The Infant Prodigy of the 1948 show and an Olympian champion at the tender age of 17 , he had grown to a man 's estate , bigger , stronger and handsomer . Here was the Olympic ideal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fullback on the Stanford University football team , this tremendous athlete actually had become better and more proficient in every event . He qualified for Helsinki by breaking his own world record , just by way of serving warning on his foes that he had n't yet slipped into athletic senescence . He ran 100 metres in 10.9 seconds , broad jumped 22 feet 10%8 inches ; put the shot 50 feet 53/4 inches , high jumped 6 feet 2% inches and ran 400 metres in 50.2 seconds for a total of 4,367 , just  | 27 points behind the pace he 'd held in setting his world record in the tryouts . Weariedly he slumped after the day 's ordeal was over . " Never , " he said grimly , " have I been so tired in my entire life . " And he still had another five events to go on the morrow . Some 250 points behind was a new wonder boy , the 18-year-old Milton Campbell , Plainfield , ( N.J. ) schoolboy , with another American , the 29-year-old Floyd Simmons from Charlotte , North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the European champion , was fourth . While the United States was busy slamming out home runs in the major leagues , the Russians were still beating out scratch hits in the minors . At the end of the day 's competition it was carefully noted that " Russia continues to lead with 348 %2 points to 250 for the United States . " Some twenty-four hours later it was the same old tune and the same old margin of 98 points although the totals had advanced to 392 %2 for the U.S.S.R. to 294 for the U.S.A. But folks were beginning to talk and ask questions . The main one was : " Will America ever be able to overhaul the Soviet ? " The propaganda talking point that the Reds were winning even had State Department officials unofficially worried . During those twenty-four hours the United States was achieving one of its most glorious individual victories . Mathias the Mighty retained his Olympic decathlon championship . It was an heroic achievement . Night is short and fleeting in Finland 's summer where the Midnight Sun gives darkness little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 P.M. , twelve hours after he had started . It was so late that the only illumination came from the pale , unpenetrating lights of the electric scoreboard . Exhausted from the physical strain , which was made even more acute by a muscle injury suffered in the high jump the day before , the California colossus swore the blood oath . " Never again will I do this , " he promised . He had said it at London but this time he meant it . He had become the first man in history to win two decathlon titles and secure is his hold on sports immortality . In typical Mathias fashion he made his farewell to the decathlon a magnificent one . He broke his own world 's record .  | Neither fatigue nor injury could balk this lion-hearted youth . He ran the hurdles in 14.7 , threw the discus 153 feet 10 inches , pole vaulted 13 feet 1 ? inches , hurled the javelin 194 feet 3 ? inches and ran 1,500-metres in 4:50.8 . The significance of those performances rested in the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in the final two events in order to gain his record . So he did exactly that . The winning point total on the revised record tables ? they were revised after London ? was 7,887 points , 65 points better than the world record he 'd set in the final Olympic tryouts . What is more , he led the way for another Grand Slam as Campbell and Simmons took second and third behind him . Heinrich , the Frenchman , did n't even finish the grind . So fourth place went to a Russian , no less . No one was surprised that Mathias should win , of course . But the day 's other final was an eye-popper all the way . It was the 1,500-metre run . The overnight favorite had been Werner Lueg , a 23-year-old German , who startled track fans in a pre-Olympic meet by equalling the world record of 3:43 on his road to Helsinki . If he did n't win , Europeans expected that Roger Bannister , an Oxford medical student , would do so , following the same pattern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was pretty much of a wide-open race . Most lightly regarded of the many outsiders were Joseph Barthel of Luxembourg and Bob McMillan of Occidental College in California . It was difficult to decide which was the more obscure . Barthel , a fair half-miler , had never beaten 3:51 until he did 3:48 in a qualifying heat . McMillan 's sole claim to fame was that he had made the 1948 Olympic team as a steeplechaser and had almost drowned after tumbling into the water jump at London . At 1,500 metres his best was 3:49.3 while winning the final Olympic tryouts . The blond Lueg was the pace-setter for almost the entire distance while Barthel and McMillan , both in reverse gear , waged an unstirring struggle for last place . The 24-year-old American finally won sole possession of last place as the Luxembourger left him there to take second to Lueg at the halfway mark . He shadowed the German into the backstretch just as McMillan began to show signs of awakening from his snooze . Before the backstretch run  | was over , McMillan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had captured fourth position in the parade . Lueg was on top , followed by Barthel and Bannister . Into the homestretch they whisked . Barthel made his bid as the crowd of 70,000 roared . The German glanced back to see what was the cause of the excitement . Before he could swivel back his head Barthel was past him . So was McMillan , who ran the last hundred yards in approximately ten seconds flat , a sprinter 's gait . The German was done and the Luxembourger was almost done . Barely could he salvage the last yard of a fast-dwindling lead at the wire . But Barthel did contrive to salvage it and thus became the Olympic champion . He may have been a surprise champion but he was no fluke champion . His time proved it . The unknown Luxembourger was clocked in 3:45.2 for a new Olympic record . McMillan was caught in the same figures in second place , the fastest 1,500 metres ever run by an American . Lueg in third place , Bannister in fourth , Patrick el Marbrouk of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olow Aberg of Sweden in seventh and Ingvar Ericsson of Sweden in eighth were all under Lovelock 's record of 3:47.8 . It was a remarkable demonstration of speed and indicates how uniformly fast this field was even though it had few " name " stars . Not to be outdone by the males , the females of the species also went in for some fancy record-breaking . Marjorie Jackson , Australia 's winner of the 100 , made a double of it by capturing the 200 as well . Her time of 23.7 was well under the Olympic mark but did n't quite match her world-record clocking of 23.4 in a semi-final heat . But the shotput record apparently was offered at wholesale prices and those bargain-hunting damsels just could n't resist . Before the competition was over the old Olympic mark had been surpassed twenty-one times . Galina Zybina , a big blonde from Russia , topped the old figure on all six of her tosses . Her best was 50 feet 19/i6 inches for a new world record . The Amazons from the Soviet also took third and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program approached its conclusion , the swimming and the basketball began to pick up mo-  | mentum . Clark Scholes of Michigan State broke the Olympic record with 57.1 in the 100-metre sprint while two Hungarian gals set new standards in the 100-metre free style and the 200-metre breast stroke . All were made in qualifying heats . The American basketball team , the overwhelming favorite to take the dribble championship , continued to struggle along unimpressively . Despite overconfidence , the U.S. quintet was still able to win as it awaited its match with Russia 's European champion , the only thing sure to jolt it from its lethargy . The final day of the track program , a Sunday , drew another capacity crowd of 70,000 curious people . Their curiosity was provoked , naturally enough , by Emil Zatopek . Not satisfied with winning the 5,000 metres and the 10,000 metres , the rubbery Czech announced that he would also be a starter in the marathon , a distance of 26 miles 385 yards . This was in spite of the fact that he never had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep down in his heart , that he could win . " If I did n't think I could win , " he said disdainfully , " I would n't have entered . " He was n't boasting . He merely was telling the truth . By golly , maybe he would win , impossible as it seemed . The marathon was to start and end in the Olympic Stadium . In between , though , it pierced through the countryside , up hill and down dale , on pavement and dirt roads . For Zatopek this would be the test supreme because he would n't be running on the cushiony and level cinder path without even a pebble out of place . For ten and a half miles he trailed Jim Peters , Britain 's hope , as hundreds of thousands of Finns lined the course . There were grandmothers and babes in arms . They peered from balcony windows in the city itself and from rocky eminences in the country . But at the eleventh mile Zatopek took command . One observer , a droll fellow , noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Communist he is . But all observers noted that the bouncing Czech did no showboating . He did n't grimace in stimulated agony . He merely ran in the most effortless fashion possible , wasting no motions . By the twentieth mile he 'd killed off Peters and he 'd also killed off practically everyone else . He 'd lost all pursuers by the time he re-entered the Olympic  | Stadium and was half a mile in front . It was easy the way Emil did it and the Finnish spectators , more than those of any other nationality appreciative of distance-running greatness , gave him an ovation which must have been heard up at the North Pole . Emil even smiled as he snapped the tape . Then he strolled down the track , kissed his wife and chatted pleasantly as he whipped off his red Communist jersey and donned his blue pullovers . He was n't even out of breath . Zatopek was calmly munching an apple when Reinaldo Corno of Argentina , his runner-up , entered the stadium to be followed by Gustaf Jansson of Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Finland and Delfo Cabrera , the defending champion from Argentina . All six of them had broken the old Olympic record of 2 hours 29 minutes and 19.2 seconds . Zatopek had destroyed it beyond recognition with 2:23:03.2 , the equivalent of a world record . Even in the flush of victory his only comment was smack on the target . " The marathon , " observed Emil , " is a very boring race . " While the marathoners were getting bored in their tour of the countryside , the stadium spectators were n't a bit bored . They were watching some very exciting relay finals and the not-so-exciting 10,000-metre walk and women 's high jump . The pedestrian event went to John Mikaelsson of Sweden in 45:02.8 , just two-tenths under his old Olympic record . The jump went to Ester Brand of South Africa at 5 feet 5.75 inches . The extraordinary part about it ? it almost was a reason for an embarrassed blush ? was that she failed to break any record at all even though the margin of failure was one millimeter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break a world record although the scorching 40.1 seconds was only three-tenths away . But the quartet of Dean Smith , Harrison Dillard , Lindy Remigino and Andy Stanfield ( the last three being Olympic champions ) achieved a prize they regarded as more important . Thanks to Stanfield 's blazing anchor leg for a four-yard victory , they beat Russia , Hungary , Great Britain , France and Czechoslovakia . The big one was Russia because this race afforded Soviet athletes their last opportunity to win a gold medal . It made the shutout complete .  | The United States missed out in the 1,600-metre relay but Americans felt that they had at least a proxy claim to the championship ? three-quarters of it , anyway . A team from little Jamaica not only won it but won it in stupendous fashion with a breath-taking 3:03.9 for a new world 's record . They had to run that fast to win because the American quartet of 011ie Matson , Gene Cole , Charlie Moore and Mal Whitfield also broke the world record , a skimpy tenth of a second behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and France took the other places . The odd thing about the Jamaica team ? and here 's where that proxy business comes in ? is that Arthur Wint is a London medical student ; Leslie Laing , a California collegian ; Herb McKenley , a graduate of the University of Illinois , and George Rhoden , a graduate of Morgan State College near Baltimore . Both McKenley and Rhoden live in the Bronx . It was a titantic race where Laing , slowest of the eight , did a clinking 47 seconds flat while McKenley , fastest of the eight , did an incredible 44.6 seconds on his leg ( the world record is 45.8 ) and picked up thirteen yards on Moore , whose 46.2 leg was the fastest of his life . The splits certainly are worth recording . Matson beat Wint by a yard as both did 46.8 ; Cole 's 45.8 opened twelve yards on Laing 's 47 flat ; McKenley 's 44.6 sent him a yard in front of Moore 's 46.2 and that was to be the margin of victory as Rhoden and Whitfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the women 's 400-metre relay as an American quartet of Mae Faggs , Barbara Jones , Janet Moreau and Catherine Hardy was clocked in 45.9 as a second-place German team also was under the old figures . The American victory was a real surprise . But it added up to the most astounding record orgy in Olympic history on a track the experts deemed slow . In men and women 's events there was a total of 151 records made . Of the twenty-four men 's events Olympic records were broken in nineteen and tied in two . Six of these were world 's records . In nine women 's events Olympic records were set in eight , world records in four and a world record equalled in one . WOW !  | There was only one swimming final as Scholes , who had set an Olympic record the day before in the 100-metre sprint , won after a bad scare . " I swam a foolish race , " he moaned . He went out too fast in the beginning and barely had enough left to head off Hiroshu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the championship , which was the main idea in the first place . At the day 's end the point score , still unofficial but still watched with mounting interest by the world at large , showed Russia even further ahead with 496%2 to 376 . The Soviet had piled up points heavily in Greco-Roman wrestling where the United States was n't even entered . So bright were things looking for the Reds that they began to post team totals on a huge scoreboard in their private Olympic Village . Just to be on the safe side and to give themselves a slightly better edge , they cleverly invented a point-scoring system of their own . Designed to counteract the big American first-place bulge , the Russians awarded only 7 points for a first instead of 10 , assigning to the others the same 5-4-3-2-1 . It was at this stage in the program that the Russians formally proposed to the Congress of the International Athletic Federation that it recognize team scoring . The move was quickly voted down but it was obvious that the Russians were beginning to feel their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Monday , that score stood at 502 %2 for Russia and 425 for the United States . Although the Soviet had begun to run out of events in which it might pick up points , the Americans were rapidly running out of time . It would take maximum effort and peak production to bridge the gap and balk a Red propaganda victory . On that tenth day came the long-awaited basketball clash between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. Before this tensely awaited struggle took place , however , the one disgraceful " incident " to mar these Games stole away the spotlight . Vincent Farrell , a basketball referee from Newark , New Jersey , found himself officiating in a tight , bitterly-waged contest between Uruguay and France . Just before the end the Frenchmen had a 68-66 lead when Farrell 's whistle signalled a foul on a Uruguayan .  | It was too much for the trigger-tempered South Americans to stand . Wilfredo Palaez charged Farrell and swung a right which would have done credit to Luis Angel Firpo , the Wild Bull of the Pampas . It struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Farrell from the court , the players ' bench and the stands . Someone choked him from behind and someone else kicked him while he was on the floor . It took the police to restore order as Farrell was lugged off to the American infirmary for repairs This incident took some of the zing out of the Russo-American game . Coach Warren Womble and his assistant , Phog Allen , did n't have to give any pep talk to their squad , a combination of Phillips Oilers and University of Kansas . The boys were " high " for the first time in the tournament . Despite frantic Soviet efforts to slow down play , the Americans crushed the Reds , 86 to 58 . Our big men , the 7-foot Bob Kurland and the almost-as-tall Clyde Lovellette , were too much for the Russians . The nearest thing to an incident came when Lovellette fell atop Otar Korkiia , the Soviet star , while pursuing a free ball . Since the Kansas giant weighs 240 pounds , he did n't improve Korkiia 's health . The Reds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They made no protest . In the nearby swimming pool Skippy Browning of Dallas won the springboard diving to set up a Grand Slam for the United States as Miller Anderson and Bob Clotworthy took the other two medals . In the day 's other final a pretty brunette from Hungary , Katalin Szoke , won the women 's 100-metre free style in a race so close that it took the judges ten minutes to determine the champion . Olympic records were set by a Japanese team in an 800-metre free style heat and by Per-Olaf Ostrand of Sweden in a 400-metre free style trial . The relay record lasted only one day . An American quartet of Wayne Moore , Bill Woolsey , Ford Konno and Jimmy McLane shaved an astounding eleven seconds off it as they did 8:31.1 to upset the favored Nipponese . A magnificent anchor leg by McLane did the trick .

By nightfall that point score , looming larger and larger , stood at 514 ? for Russia and 440 for the United States . One day later , a Wednesday , it stood at 523 %z to 463 in accordance with the universally accepted method of tabulating this unofficial team scoring . The Russians , using their own arithmetic , placed the count at 453 to 349% in their favor . What is more , they were openly predicting victory and even Radio Moscow bleated blatantly away . " We are certain to win , " proudly boasted a spokesman On that particular day progress was slow . Mrs. Patricia McCormick of Long Beach , California , won the women 's springboard div , ing from Mady Mareau of France and from Mrs. Jackie Jensen , the Zoe Ann Olsen of the 1948 Olympics and wife of the Washington Senators outfielder . But Boiteux , the 19-year-old Frenchman , upset all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 400-metre free-style championship as Wayne Moore and Jimmy McLane , the Yale boys , disappointed by taking sixth and seventh . It was no fluke because the Frenchman did 4:30.7 for an Olympic record . This was the day American weight lifters grew indignant because some European newspapers said that Russia had beaten the United States in the strong man competition . However , our muscle men produced four of the seven champions in Tommy Kono , Pete George , Norbert Schemansky and John Davis , the other three titles going to the Soviet . The U.S. made eleven world records to six for the Reds and won the team title on that same " unofficial " basis , 50 to 49 . On Thursday , the thirteenth day of the Olympics , the big news was the basketball victory of the United States over Argentina , 85 to 75 , to gain the Olympic final . And who else should make it but the Russians , only because their earlier defeat by the Star Spangled boys had n't eliminated them . They 'd won everything else .  | More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling on dry land . Joan Harrison of South Africa won the women 's 100-metre backstroke final in non-record time but marks fell to Yoshinobu Oyakawa , 18-year-old Hawaiian in a 100-metre backstroke trial ; Jerry Holan of Ohio State , Herb Klein of Germany and Ludevic Komadel of Czechoslovakia in 200-metre breast stroke trials ; Evelyn Kawamoto , Honolulu-born American , and Daphne Wilkinson of Great Britain in the women 's 400-metre free style , and all eight qualifiers in the 1,500-metre free style . Best time was turned in by Shiro Hasizume of Japan who knocked 38 seconds off the old mark . At the end of the day those point totals found the margin narrowing . But would it ever narrow in time ? It stood at 523 %2 to 465 . The fourteenth Olympic day stirred up hope . By golly , maybe it could be done . Maybe Russia could be overhauled . Major Sammy Lee of the Army Medical Corps captured the platform dive and Oyakawa , the Hawaiian , not only won the 100-metre backstroke but set a new Olympic record . Another Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important thing was that the United States , scrapping and clawing for every place , gained a total of 34 points in the swimming alone . The gap had grown smaller in the race for the unofficial team championship as the Russian advantage dwindled to 533 ' /2 to 499 . However , just one full day of real competition remained if the equestrian tests at the Closing Ceremonies were to be discounted . They could n't make much difference anyway . Thus it was that the final Saturday was reached with America 's Olympians backed up to the wall for a last do-or-die effort . They were equal to the occasion . They more than met the challenge , scoring an amazing 111 points to surge into the lead , 610 to 5331A . That very evening curious observers peeked in at the huge scoreboard in the Russian 's private Olympic Village to see just how this worked out under the Soviet system . The scoreboard was blank . The numbers , which had once been proudly put in place , had disappeared . " I do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presi-  | dent of the Soviet Olympic Committee , as he edged toward the nearest exit . " I do not know how we stand . " The most unexpected part of the rally came when five American boxers ? Nate Brooks , Charles Adkins , Floyd Patterson , Norval Lee and Eddie Sanders ? won Olympic championships , our biggest boxing sweep ever . Ford Konno of Ohio State set an Olympic record in winning the 1,500-metre free style and Mrs. Patrick McCormick won the high board dive . We also scored in the men 's 200-metre breast stroke where John Davies of Australia set an Olympic record and in the women 's 400-metre free style where Valerie Gyenge of Hungary did the same . However , the basketball final did give us a bad scare . The Reds played possession ball , uninterested in shooting themselves but so controlling the ball that the Americans could n't do much scoring . It was a tight one all the way before the United States won by the startlingly low count of 36 to 25 . The Olympic Games ended the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Prix de Nations equestrian competition the Americans picked up a third for an extra four points , making the final margin over Russia 614 to 553%z . It was a glorious ending to a glorious set of Games . In twenty sports the United States took the most gold medals , 41 to Russia 's 23 ; the most total medals , 75 to 68 ; the most unofficial team championships in different sports , 7 to 5 . After the Olympics had ended Pravda , the Soviet 's newspaper mouthpiece , hailed the " world superiority " of the Russian athletes and proudly asserted that they had won more medals than anyone else . They offered no figures or substantiation . Two days more of point juggling in Moscow , an arithmetical juggle that was continued until it added up satisfactorily , brought an official admission . It was that the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. had ended in an absolute dead heat , each with 494 points . Thus did another Olympic year depart into its place in history . It was a year of overwhelming distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union as a most formidable  | sports power . It could very well have marked the end of the United States as the dominant force in these quadrennial Games . Despite an appalling ignorance of proper techniques , the superbly conditioned Russian athletes , government-trained and governmentsponsored , made a superlative showing . Helsinki will be ever-memorable . A wonderful people staged a wonderful set of Olympic Games . They staged them on the fringe of the Iron Curtain and enticed Russian athletes out from beyond that Iron Curtain . But was it for better or for worse , this lurking of a coldly realistic nation into the dreamy never-never land of Olympic idealism ? Only time , the inscrutable , will be able to supply the answer .  | MELBOURNE 1956 NEW YEAR 'S DAY of 1956 came hurtling out of the East on schedule .

Tropic north and frigid south ? Sure , this is the upsidedown land at the bottom of the world where their summer is our winter . The Aussies do n't walk on the ceiling , or anything like that , but there had to be something of an Alice-in-Wonderland aura of unreality about the Melbourne Olympics . It was to be studded with anomalies from the very beginning . Prior to 1956 the Olympic Games had always been a Northern Hemisphere proposition , the midsummer night 's dream of the world of muscle . That meant a sixteen-day show somewhere between the middle of July and the middle of August .

Furthermore , there was a solid core of diehards among them who were ready to become Indian givers and yank back their gift if the Aussies offered the slightest excuse . And the Australians promptly began behaving in a pattern which is ? well , er , Australian . It just defies any other description . Rugged individualists and nonconformists that they are , the folks Down Under started acting as though they 'd set a new Olympic record for kicking over the traces . This was astonishing because Australia is undoubtedly the most sports-mad nation on the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that outsiders got the impression that the Aussies really were n't too interested in staging this greatest of international shows . The trustees of the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the most logical site for the major events , grumpily decided that they did n't want their sacred turf dug up . It would have interfered with the cricket matches and the football . This was in 1950 or thereabouts . But a couple of years later the trustees reconsidered the matter and came to the reluctant conclusion that somebody better start doing something some time . The Melbourne Cricket Ground would just have to be yielded to Olympic idealism , no matter how violently cricketeers and footballers disapproved . The neighboring but unneighborly city of Sydney jeered openly at Melbourne 's indecisiveness . These two cities are not unlike Dallas and Fort Worth or even a couple of Kilkenny cats . The family argument not only had Melbourne snapping at Sydney and vice versa but even the top political figures on the continent became involved ? Robert Gordon Menzies , the Prime Minister , and John Cain , the Premier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year 's Day of 1953 the alarm over Melbourne 's total lack of preparation even had the International Olympic Committee in a tizzy . Avery Brundage , the president of the IOC , dispatched cablegrams to the three Australian members of the IOC and asked for " an official picture of the situation . " Brundage also hinted that Rome , which would be the site of the  | 1960 Olympics , was so much further advanced in preparations than Melbourne that it even could accommodate the 1956 show . Two months later the international president announced that he 'd fly Down Under for a personal inspection tour . He was getting anxious to the point of desperation . " Do n't waste your time , " said the Australians in effect . Arthur Coles , chairman of the Organizing Committee , was slightly more specific . " If Brundage came now , " he told newsmen , " there would be nothing to show him . All we could do would be to put him in a plane and fly him over the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . ' " If the rebuff to Brundage accomplished nothing else , at least it led to a renewal of the fighting and bickering among the Aussies . The Australian government flatly refused to permit an army barracks to be used as an Olympic Village . The Victorian government , faced by a housing shortage , backed away from the idea of wasting housing money on athletes . The federal officials charged the state officials with being spoilers and angry Victorians flailed back with countercharges of the same character . Each branch of the government then took a firm stand . Premier Cain of Victoria , a Laborite , barred state funds from being used for construction of the Olympic Village . " If the Village is to be erected , " he proclaimed , " the Common- wealth must build it . We do n't have the money . " j Prime Minister Menzies , a Conservative , barred the use of federal funds because he had no intentions of permitting the Victorian Labor government to use the Olympics as an excuse for prying extra housing money out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year , " he said tartly , " to build five Olympic Villages . " Suddenly and in typical Australian fashion , the Aussies stopped fighting among themselves and banded solidly together to fight the rest of the world . The federal government graciously consented to loan the state government $4,500,000 to begin instant construction of the Olympic Village . After years of constant fumbling the ball in the end  | zone , the Aussies finally had taken a firm grip on it and were heading downfield toward the right goal-line for the first time . Hardly had they crossed the 5-yard line , though , when a surprise tackler almost upended them . On the eve of an all-important meeting of the International Olympic Committee at Mexico City in April of 1953 , the committee representatives from Down Under found themselves bedeviled by their strict laws quarantining horses . There could be no escape from it , either . The law specified that no horses could be admitted to Australia unless they first had passed six months ' quarantine in New Zealand , Ireland or the United Kingdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equestrian competition with the Prix de Nations jumping events an integral part of the Closing Ceremonies . The quarantine would eliminate this as effectively as if the Aussies had hamstrung every horse . So the members of the International Olympic Committee were frowning more than usual at their Mexico City meeting . This was merely another black mark on a report card which showed mighty few passing grades . Yet spokesmen from Down Under talked convincingly enough in the closed session to persuade the top brass of the IOC that Melbourne should remain as the Olympic site . One month later Arthur W. Coles , the chief planner for the Games , resigned and charged the Victorian government with a breach of faith , repudiating promises he 'd made to the IOC on its behalf . " Something must be seriously wrong down there , " remarked Brundage . You said it , kid . The Victorian government , which had approved Fawkner Park as a site for the swimming stadium , bowed to Labor Party pressure . The Laborites insisted that this was a violation of the sanctity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Olympics . The International Olympic Committee squirmed uneasily all over the globe . In March of 1954 the contractors moved in ? somewhat tardily , it might be added ? to build the Olympic Village and to increase the capacity of the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Some of the more  | whimsical members of the IOC wryly thought that Rome was not built in a day , but Rome already was further advanced for the 1960 Games than Melbourne was for the 1956 show . The belligerently free and independent Australians issued one rule about their Olympic Village , however . It would house all athletes of all nations without exception . The Russians could not have a separate Olympic Village for themselves and their satellites as they did in Helsinki . They 'd mingle with the other blokes or they could go jump in the ruddy lake ? preferably a Siberian one . At any rate the Australian progress apparently had advanced far enough by May of 1954 that the Athens meeting of the IOC never even raised the question of taking away the Games from Melbourne . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted to separate the equestrian events from their normal place in the main show and stage them in Stockholm in I June of 1956 . But by April of 1955 a worried Brundage flew down to Australia for a personal look-see . He stayed worried . " I leave Melbourne with the question on my mind : Can the job be done ? " he said as he headed for Canberra and a conference with Prime Minister Menzies . " Mr. Brundage is not noted for undue silences , " cryptically remarked the Prime Minister after the international Olympic president had departed for home . Being no respecters of persons , the Aussies did n't hesitate to call a strike of building workers against the Olympic Village contractors during the Brundage visit . No sooner had he left than the carpenters went on strike in the main stadium . Union labor is allpowerful Down Under . But while the old decathlon champion was in Melbourne he spoke some blunt words . Brundage always speaks bluntly . " Melbourne has a deplorable record of promises upon promises , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of management , bickering . Today more than ever the world thinks we made a mistake in giving the Games to Melbourne " I hope that the Games do n't have to be taken away but I would f  | like to leave with the assurance that the job will be done . I am not satisfied with the progress being made . Too much still is in the planning stage . " The reaction to the Brundage prodding was astonishing . The Aussies are a sensitive , touchy people who are quick to resent attacks by outsiders . But they took this jab without blinking and without complaint . Then they really went to work . Brundage was in Paris a few months later when reports of real progress reached him . " At last they are awake to their great responsibility , " he said happily . At that same approximate time General William Bridgeford , the executive director of the Games , was showing the Olympic sites and sights in Melbourne to touring journalists from all over the world . " The corner is turned , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world straight in the bloody eye . Let 's have a drink of gin . " A year before the Olympics were scheduled , the Aussies had made such rapid strides in their progress that it was apparent even to the worst pessimist from Sydney that Melbourne would be ready . Thus the arrival of New Year 's Day of 1956 did more than herald the Olympic Year to the folks of Australia . No longer did they have to dread its approach or greet it with anxiety and embarrassment . They could watch it with heads held high , justifiably proud that they 'd achieved the impossible . It 's no wonder , therefore , that the sigh of relief was so profound when the Olympic Year came bounding briskly off the International Date Line and landed without misadventure on the carefully prepared cushion the Aussies had made ready for it . Three hours later the new Olympic Year came streaking westward . It brushed against the topmost peaks of the Dolomite Alps in Italy and hurried on its way . The villagers in Cortina d'Ampezzo , the picture-postcard resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but made no fuss , breathed no sighs of relief and casually accepted it . This also was their Olympic Year but they 'd been ready for its coming for ages .  | Cortina d'Ampezzo was the site of the Winter Olympics and the Italian hosts had only one concern . Would the weather behave ? Everything else was set . Their uneasiness was admirable , understandable and natural . With a perverse , ghoulish sense of humor the weather gods have always persisted in playing pranks on the refrigerated section of international show . It normally never snowed enough or snowed too much at the Winter Olympics . And invariably it was too warm or too cold . Two weeks before the Opening Ceremonies , scheduled for January 26 , the Cortina citizenry began to fear the very worst . There had n't been as much as one flake of snow out of the skies in twentyfour days . The ski runs showed bare , ugly patches of brown earth instead of glistening carpets of white snow . " We 're jinxed , " moaned the commandant of the Alpine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been performing the rather unsoldierly task of transporting truckloads of snow from the upper Alp to Cortina proper . Then on January 9 the snow-shoveling detail let out whoops of joy . It began to snow . It was n't heavy but it sure was better than nothing at all . It kept floating down and Cortina smiled . On and on the snow came for twenty-four hours , a two-foot blanket of such wondrous beauty that the innkeepers were supplying the " vino " on the house . Five days later those same innkeepers were grumpy enough to make everyone pay for his drinks . A January thaw had descended on Cortina and all that marvelous snow was shrinking out of sight . After three days of thaws the athletes were dashing off to other winter resorts in other countries in a wild attempt to get some extra practice . The odd part about it was that Europe was being lashed by its worst winter in memory . It even snowed in the French Riviera and in parts of the continent that never even had seen real snow before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice slopes had uneven snow conditions and a heavy toll was taken of contestants even before the Olympic goal was in sight . Katy Rodolph , America 's best skier , broke a vertebrae in her neck . A Yugoslav gal broke an ankle . A  | German fraiilein broke an arm . An Icelander broke his leg . A Belgian bobsledder broke his arm . Three Russian skiers were carted to the infirmary with ( 1. ) a broken leg ; ( 2. ) a sprained right ankle ; ( 3. ) a sprained left ankle . Even Tenley Albright , American figure-skating champion , was a casualty . She tripped over a hole in the ice and sliced her leg with her skate . However , the athletes who attracted the most attention at all times were the Russians . The eyes of villagers and tourists popped at the sight of the businesslike and generally unsmiling Soviet competitors . This was their debut in the Winter Olympics and that could only mean that they were ready . Four years earlier the Comrades failed to show up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sure did case the joint with the thoroughness of Willie Sutton about to pull off a bank stick-up . " We 'd have won if we 'd bothered to enter , " said a Soviet spokesman " Oh , yeah ? " said the rest of the world , laughing cynically . But when the Reds made so strong a showing at Helsinki that summer , all cynicism disappeared . Maybe the spokesman was n't exaggerating after all . Which of the 32 nations was numerically strongest at Cortina ? Soviet Russia , of course . Four days before the Olympic opening , time trials were held for the speed skaters at Lake Misurina . Two Russians broke the world record for 500 metres and a third Russian tied the old mark . One American skater slipped on a turn and landed in a ditch of icy water . There could have been something symbolic about those performances . " We have fifty men for each event , " boasted one Russian official . " And they are so evenly matched we had to draw lots to decide who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogwash because the Soviet tries to leave nothing to chance . And yet the exaggeration manifestly had some factual basis . The day after the Russians did their record-smashing , the marks were disallowed on the charge that they 'd jumped the gun .  | " Every time we set a new record , somebody tries to find a hair in the soup , " sourly commented Sergei Semanov , a Soviet official . Nor were these the only overalls tossed into Mrs. Murphy 's chowder . The American skaters packed their belongings and moved out of their hotel because there was no heat . The most unbelievable complaint of all came from the French . They said there were too many distractingly pretty girls in Cortina . What 's happened to France ? One day later the gripes grew more serious and more alarming . No snow . The injury list mounted to twenty-seven and the Olympic infirmary was more than half full . " The Olympic downhill ski competition will be a race to the death if it does n't snow soon , " warned Maurice Martel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no snowfall in sight . Worried Italian officials shifted the first ski event , the giant slalom for women , from the ice-coated , rock-dotted slide to a course higher up in the mountains . Yet that one was no bargain either . On the eve of the competition there was a fitful snowfall which was too sparse to be reassuring . The Italians began to wonder if they had been wise in not hiring a wintry version of a " rainmaker . " They 'd tried it a few years previously but the " snowmaker " missed his target . Not a flake hit Cortina as blizzards struck all surrounding areas . So the hosts put their reliable Alpine troopers to work , shoveling snow onto the ski courses . They did n't get it on in time to help Eugenie Sidorova , the Russian doll who was rated the best slalom performer . She cracked up , severely wrenching shoulder and knee . " But it wo n't make any difference , " gloomily said Friedl Pfeifer , the American coach . " The Russians are platoon deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day arrived under dishearteningly bright skies . But for the Italian hosts it was a proud day nonetheless . They jammed the palings along Italia Corso , the main street of the tiny mountain village , and cheered the arrival of the Olympic flame which was brought by torch relay from the Temple of Jupiter in Rome . Into the modernistic pine stadium swept Guido Caroli , the Italian  | speed skating champion . To him was given the honor of lighting the huge bowl within which the Olympic flame would burn majestically for the eleven days of the competition . Giovanni Gronchi , president of Italy , smiled appreciatively at Caroli and the skater turned toward him in salute . It was a mistake . The torchbearer never did see the long lines of wires which had been strung across the track for the microphones . He tripped in the most inglorious and most embarrassing pratfall in all Olympic history . Then he scrambled to his feet and continued his mission in red-faced confusion . " I did n't let the flame go out , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It will be remembered . The whole incident will be forever remembered . He can be sure of that . Bedecked in leather jerkins and Florentine peaked hats , trumpeteers sounded a fanfare as the flags of 32 nations were raised slowly to the tops of the staffs . The Olympic parade began with a Greek as the traditional leader and the host country bringing up the rear . It was , as always , a colorful spectacle . President Gronchi formally opened the Winter Games and the Russians flexed their muscles , more ready than any others to take charge . Apple-cheeked Ossi Reichert , an innkeeper 's daughter from Germany , won the first medal , the women 's giant slalom . The second gold medal went to a Finn , Veikko Hakulinen , who outlegged the Russians in the 30-kilometre cross-country race . How did he do it ? " Our Finnish walkie-talkie information set-up kept me posted that the Russians were in trouble , " he said . Not even the marvels of electronics could check the Soviet thereafter . One day later the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they scored little Slams in two events with firsts , seconds and fourths . Yevgeni Grishin , the Russian whose world record of 40.8 seconds for 500 metres had been disallowed earlier in the week , made that disallowal unimportant as he ripped off 40.2 seconds . The race was so fast that a dozen skaters all broke their national records . Ken Henry , the defending champion from the United States , shattered the old Olympic record and finished only seventeenth .  | In the women 's 10-kilometre cross-country race a student from Leningrad , Lyubov Kozyreva , won by only a few yards from another Russian . Thus it was that the Soviet took firm command of the unofficial point score standings with 46 to only 15 for Finland and Italy . The Italians took the first two places in the boblet competition But the panic was on . A day later Boris Shilkov set an Olympic record in the 5,000-metre speed skating . However , Toni Sailer of Austria , the handsome 21-year old glazier , made a farce of the giant slalom with a run so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end . He was to become the only individual in the Winter Olympics who could steal spotlight or headlines from the steppers from the steppes . He was to win three ski titles in all . When it all was over the Comrades had taken three of the four speed skating championships , two skiing titles and ? horror of horrors ? the ice hockey crown . The Soviet puck-chasers routed the Americans , 4-0 , and then upset the Canadians , 2-0 . Thus did the Russians win more gold medals than any other country and scored more unofficial points , 121 , with Austria a distant runner-up at 78 ' /2 . Well down the line in sixth place was the United States . The sun shone brightly for the Closing Ceremonies but the Italians no longer cared what the sun did or did n't do . Cortina had staged a beautiful set of Winter Olympics and even the shadow of the Russian Bear was not the slightest bit terrifying . In fact few complained when Nikolai Romanov , the Soviet sports minister , threw out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here expecting triumphs in our strong events , " he said , " and expecting to gain experience in others . We did both . " He paused for effect . " And we 're going to be ' way out in front at Melbourne , " he added thoughtfully . Nor was the sports commissar just speaking for exercise . He meant every word of it and later happenings were to prove that he was n't talking through his fur hat . But before the Olympic spirit and the Olympic ideals whisked halfway around the globe from Cortina to Melbourne , they had  | to make a slight detour . They went flitting into Stockholm in June to accommodate the equestrian events which had been quarantined out of Australia . This phase of the Olympics went off nicely with Sweden , long a power in the horsey competition , winning three of the six gold medals . Two went to Germany and one to Great Britain . All the points scored in Stockholm were stored in a safe place by the unofficial point-tabulators for inclusion later on in the Melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian show . Yet there were countless uncertainties throughout the world as to how to prepare best for the upside-down seasons Down Under . In no country , perhaps , were those hesitancies as magnified as they were in the United States . No longer was it possible to be sure that the old , time-tested system was the proper way of determining the personnel of the American Olympic squad . One school of thought insisted that all final tryouts should be held in October . The other school of thought argued that the regular time of late June or early July was still the only sensible way of doing things . They claimed that all athletes would be at their peaks then and that those who made the team would be able to rearrange their college semesters in advance without having to make haphazard , last-minute arrangements . The second group of thinkers won out . Now that it 's over , it is quite clear that they chose the right course . Pride and patriotism combined to keep the stand-by Olympians in tip-top shape until the November fly-away time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That this would be the strongest track and field team America ever sent to an Olympic Games was rather obvious . Sure , there were heartbreaks at some who failed to qualify . Most notable , of course , was Dave Sime , a big red-headed sprinter from Duke , who kept smashing world records all season only to bob up with a crippling injury just before the tryouts . But those tests produced the first 7-foot high jump in history as the 19-year-old Charlie Dumas went a half inch over the magic mark . Bobby Morrow and two others equaled the world 100-metre  | record . Three men , led by Glenn Davis , went under the world mark in the 400-metre hurdles . Lou Jones blazed 400 metres for a new universal standard . It was a mass assault on the athletic almanac " These boys will do even better when they get to Melbourne , " said Jim Kelly of Minnesota , the happy head coach of the track team . It was no idle boast . Not too long thereafter the Russians held their tryouts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage the 1964 Olympics . They were n't happy at all . Most of their performances were disappointing and Pravda snarled at the athletes while officials beat their breasts until they resounded like African tomtoms " What 's the matter with our sprinters ? " screamed the controlled press . Nothing was the matter with them except that they carry too much lead in the wrong places . Even the Kremlin has n't the power to use the factory speed-up system in foot racing . Before autumn began , all was in readiness for the first Olympics below the equator . The physical plant at Melbourne was glistening in new paint , anxiously awaiting the start of the show . Acceptances were pouring in from all over the world , thus allaying earlier fears that travel distances , added expense and out-of-season competition might cut sharply into the entry lists . By the end of October the lists had swelled to a record of 74 nations , five more than the previous record which had been set four years earlier at Helsinki . The Soviet headed the rolls with 510 athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the host country of Australia had the surprisingly large number of 360 . But the Aussies never had a chance to get muscle-bound from slapping each other on the back . From the least expected quarter came new difficulties . Like the mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb , war clouds billowed over Hungary and Suez in black , ominous fashion . The Hungarians rebelled against their Russian masters after unrest in Poland had given them encouragement . But the Soviet ruthlessly cracked down on Hungary with tanks and guns . Then Britain and  | France followed an Israeli attack on Egypt by moving into the Suez Canal area themselves . The whole world held its collective breath because big wars grow out of little wars just as five-alarm fires grow from stray sparks . To the Australians , however , the timing of such imminent disasters was far more catastrophic than would be the case ordinarily . None really could blame them for such an attitude . Having achieved the impossible by getting ready for the Olympic Games , the folks Down Under could see them snatched away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all was that the strong Hungarian Olympic team already had started on its journey . Most of the squad was in a staging area in Czechoslovakia . But one batch already was en route on ? of all things ? the Russian merchant ship , Oruzia . It was a gigantic , hideous jest since 91 Soviet athletes were shipmates of 17 Hungarians . The rumors flowed in both directions at once : Hungory would compete in the Olympics and Hungary would not . Three Arab nations ? Egypt , Lebanon and Iraq ? withdrew in prkiest against the action in Suez . Two total neutrals , Spain and the Netherlands , withdrew in protest against Russia 's savage and murderous treachery in Hungary . Then Switzerland did the same . That last step embarrassed Otto Mayer , the chancellor of the International Olympic Committee , because he is a Swiss . He exerted pressure by propounding the cardinal Olympic principle that the Games were above and apart from politics . So the Swiss saw the light and recanted . They 'd compete and catch the next plane for Melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had departed without them and they could n't get another . They asked the U.S. Air Force to supply transportation for some reason which defies comprehension . It was no dice . Hence the Swiss sat home after all . Then Red China got its nose out of joint ? this is not a difficult ideological trick ? when the Aussies ran up the Nationalist Chinese flag in the Olympic Village . Out went Red China without a single tear being shed . Bold words were uttered by Australia 's Olympic heads that the Games would be held " irregardless . " Few listeners believed , how-  | ever , that the spokesmen were quite as confident as they sounded . The most mournful remark of all was credited to the idealistic Avery Brundage . " In ancient days , " he said sadly , " nations stopped wars to compete in the Games . Nowadays we stop the Olympics to continue our wars . " However , he also insisted that it would be the equivalent of " business as usual " during the attempted " alterations " in Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , athletes kept streaming into the Olympic Village . Arrival times were posted in advance , as orderly and scheduled as a railroad terminal . Only the Russians insisted on being mysterious . Their merchantman , Gruzia , seemed to have disappeared in the Indian Ocean with its strange cargo of Russian and Hungarian athletes . The anxious Aussies kept expecting it to heave into port any day but inquiries met a wall of silence . The Gruzia never acknowledged . Nor was there any word from Moscow as to when the main body of the team would depart by plane . Only in their more panicky moments did Australian authorities wonder if the Soviet would withdraw completely . But then practicality calmed them down . The Russians wanted that Olympic competition for its propaganda value . Tensions eased with a dispatch from New Delhi which stated that the Red brothers were passing through India en route to the land Down Under . Still no word from the Gruzia , though . It lay hidden behind its own Salt-Spray Curtain , bobbing idly on the ocean and presumably waiting for orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the Essendon airport in Melbourne . A 63-man contingent spilled out , grim and unsmiling . Only the 7-foot Jan Kruminsh , the gangling basketball center , betrayed a human emotion . He grinned toothily and waved his hat to the crowd . Later that night the Gruzia broke silence . The overdue ship reported that she would dock in another two days . It was taken for  | granted that none of the Hungarians aboard would have to walk the plank in mid-ocean . But the large colony of former Hungarians in Melbourne , the thousands who had fled from Communist rule in their homeland to settle in Australia , seethed in an emotional torment . They 'd followed the news of the bloody Soviet reprisals in their native land with anguish and with anger . Hatred of Communism boiled to a new white heat . No sooner had the advance guard of the Hungarian team arrived at the Olympic Village than the athletes swiftly hauled down the Hungarian flag , ripped off the Communist emblem on it and proudly returned it on high . By a quirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government during its brief stay in power in Budapest . Thus was Hungary 's national flag of yesteryear the official one and Nagy 's puppet successors did n't dare order a change . That evening the main body of Hungarians arrived . Thousands upon thousands of their former countrymen swarmed to the airport to give them a tearful greeting . The new colonists carried armfuls of flowers and the old red , white and green flags . They shouted the ancient Magyar battle cries . They sang their national anthem , " God Bless Hungary . " They screamed in defiance , " Long live Free Hungary . " The Olympians were visibly shaken by their welcome . Nor did they miss the significance of the black arm bands of mourning which were worn by the Hungarian emigres . The Hungarian athletes joined their strong , young voices to the shouts for a Free Hungary . Then Julius Hegyi , the gray-haired chief of the team , addressed the crowd . Said he : " We thank you for your warm-hearted welcome . We promise you our youth will bring glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were to be all sorts of rumors for the next few days , but the political ferment ? the word " political " is used here only in the broadest , most generic sense ? soon subsided . Even the Russian athletes started smiling and they fraternized without any semblance of self-consciousness with their fellow tenants in the Olympic  | Village . Some of the disciples of Marx and Lenin even danced with American girls and took enthusiastically to rock ' n ' roll . As soon as athletic workouts began , however , visitors to Melbourne became aware of the weather . It ranged from being just mediocre to being downright nasty . The press box residents took a quick study of Australia 's upside-down calendar and realized for the first time that the Olympic fortnight from November 22 to December 8 was not in Australia 's summer but in the late spring . The folks Down Under did n't dare set a midsummer date or they 'd have bounced into a new year , thereby departing too violently from any semblance of normalcy . The training tracks too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little America at the South Pole . It was unpleasant to an extreme , even for picture-taking . That 's when Cliff Blair , the hammer thrower , had his first run-in with Coach Jim Kelly . Blair flatly refused to peel off his sweat-suit and expose his epidermis to the breezes for photographers . Later on , the big weight thrower was dropped from the team because he served as an amateur correspondent for a Boston paper and declined to desist . He was ousted for " lack of cooperation , " among other reasons . " It rains on all alike , " said Bob Giegengack , the Yale coach , in a bold clutch at straws . But everyone was worried and Bob Richards , the defending pole vault champion , confessed that he 'd lost his form and had had to change his style of vaulting . Only the Russians seemed oblivious of conditions . They trained twice as long and twice as hard as any others . Yet the Australians never lost their optimism as the big day approached . They kept telling visitors that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples of all four seasons in one day . No one was that greedy for variety , though . Most were willing to settle for just one season , summer . And then summer arrived . It was almost as though the Aussies had guarded it as carefully as the Olympic flag , stored away with tender care until the Opening Ceremonies . Sedate Melbourne began boiling with an excitement that was quite contrary to its prim habits and Victorian traditions . The  | saloons still closed at 6 P.M. but the approach of the Olympic Games was an intoxicating drink by itself . Crowds milled up and down Bourke Street and Collins Street almost like New Year 's Eve celebrants in Times Square in the good old days . But the Aussies were more orderly , more sober and more eager . The sun had not even set on Olympic Eve when the queues began to form outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the Standing Room Only tickets . The most sports-mad nation on the globe was ready to give proof of its athletic insanity . And then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly fashion , almost as if it had received formal blessing from on high . Forgotten was the cold , rainy , miserable weather of the recent past with temperatures in the 40-60 degree range . The thermometer shot up to 70 and did n't stop . Not until after it had passed 80 did it slow down and hover . The Olympic Stadium was jam-packed until it bulged with overeager spectators . There were 103,000 at hand for the Opening Ceremonies . There were to be 103,000 for the Closing Ceremonies and also for each day of the track and field competition in between . These were truly remarkable turnouts for a nation whose entire population is approximately the same as New York State . The throng came early and the entertainment was supplied by massed military bands , most wearing pith helmets . They played " Waltzing Matilda " so often that it almost seemed as though the needle was stuck . At the appointed hour of 3 P.M. a black Humber limousine rolled onto the red track . In the open tonneau sat the Duke of Edinburgh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made one complete circuit , waving to the happy , cheering crowds . Then he greeted Olympic dignitaries in casual , friendly fashion before taking his place in the tribune of honor in the stands . The Olympic parade began as some 4,000 athletes from 67 nations stepped smartly over the brick-red surface of the running track . First to appear , as always , was Greece . If the leader of the Greek delegation seemed familiar to California members of the  | American team , it was understandable . He was George Roubanis , a sophomore pole vaulter at U.C.L.A. Onto the field they streamed , big squads , little squads and inbetween squads . The costuming was as varied as a masquerade party and even more colorful . The Bermuda team , for instance , wore Bermuda shorts . What else would you expect ? The Czechs waved hands ardently as they marched along . The Hungarians were sad-faced . Yet they received a tumultuous ovation every step of the way . The Americans were smart-looking in white blazers , blue slacks and white berets . They , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alphabetical procession came the representatives of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics . The gals were bareheaded . One whimsical observer , Red Smith , said this was out of respect for Nina Ponomareva . She was the female discus thrower who was arrested for shoplifting in London a few months earlier , after she 'd been caught snitching five cheap hats . Nina and the rest of the Russians received formally decorous applause of medium decibel content . And then came the Australians in the traditional rear place that the host nation takes . The Australian crowd roared in a deepthroated delight that was genuinely touching . When the parade ended , the massed bands struck up " God Save the Queen . " It rolled across the green turf and cascaded over the densely packed stands in rich , thunderous , majestic tones . There was a cathedral hush after the final note . Then the roar of the crowd reached a new crescendo . Down on the field the rostrum at the side of the track was ascended by Avery Brundage of Chicago , the president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he formally invited the Duke to open the games . The Duke traveled 16,000 miles to utter 16 words . That 's a thousand miles a word . He spoke them in firm voice : " I declare open the Olympic Games of Melbourne celebrating the Sixteenth Olympiad of the modern era . " Cannons boomed , trumpets blared and the skies were darkened by the release of thousands of white pigeons . Up to the main mas-  | terhead arose the white Olympic flag with its varicolored , interlocking rings . All eyes turned instantly to the far end of the track where the torchbearer was to appear . This was the anchor leg of a transglobal relay . It had begun at the Temple of Jupiter when the flame was lit , a flame which was to be flown across oceans in the shielded confines of a miner 's lamp . It had gone hand-to-hand from thousands of relay runners across the island continent of Australia . And now it had arrived . It was carried by the 19-year-old Ron Clarke , a young Aussie miler who had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track for a dramatic moment and began to jog around , aluminum torch in strong right hand . What few knew was that the torch was filled with fiery chunks of napthalene which spewed out with singeing effect . He was without regret when he dunked his crematory machine into the huge urn which was the Olympic flame . It caught with a resounding " Phoom ! " The cheer from the pageant-saturated crowd was deafening . The spectators were enjoying every thrill-packed minute . But down on the field there was action of an unexpected sort . The prankish weatherman was behaving like an exasperated apartment-house superintendent who wearied of having tenants clang on their radiators for more heat . So he gave ' em a full head of steam . After weeks of cold , the heat of Opening Day was almost unbearable . Athletes and standard-bearers just keeled over quietly in various stages of heat prostration . The most incongruous touch of all came when Galina Zybina of Russia , " the strongest woman in the world , " fainted just like an ordinary human . Then John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of 3:58 , stepped quickly to the microphone and took the Olympic oath for all the assembled athletes . That ended the formalities . Up on the giant scoreboard throughout the Opening Ceremonies were lettered the passionately idealistic words of Baron Pierre de Coubertin , the founding father of the modern Olympics . Declared they :  | " The Olympic movement tends to bring together in a radiant union all the qualities which guide mankind to perfection . " Lower down on the scoreboard was a realistic message from the Olympic authorities . Destined to be totally ignored , it was a halfwarning , half-plea to all press box denizens . It said : " Classification by points on a national basis is not recognized . " What it meant was : There are no such things as team standings . Please do n't invent them . One day later the headlines all over the world clarioned the news that Russia had taken a 43-35 lead over the United States in the unofficial team standings . For that second day of the Olympics , the first day of actual competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . No one rapped on the radiators for more warmth , however , because it was n't quite as chilly as it had been in the pre-Olympic period . The only fellow who thought it was a lovely day was 19-yearold Charlie Dumas from Compton Junior College in California . Yet even he was n't certain for the longest while . His responsibilities were rather heavy for one so young because he was the huge favorite to win the high jump . After all , he was the first person in all history to break past the magic height of seven feet , setting a world record of 7 feet Y2 inch in America 's final Olympic tryouts . It was at 10 A.M. that he took his first leap . Much was to happen before he took his last one at 7:40 P.M. Early in the competition Dumas lost his strongest ? or so he thought ? challenger when Nils Bengt Nilsson of Sweden failed to qualify . An injured leg had hamstrung him . But by 6 P.M. the American boy began to bemoan his luck . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kachkarov , a burly Russian , and Charles ( Chilla ) Porter , a bespectacled unknown from Australia . Dumas was n't familiar enough with the rules to know better but he thought that they 'd toss coins for the Olympic championship in the event that they tied . At coin-tossing he knew himself to be an abject failure . He always lost . However , Coach Jim Kelly let his worries wander in a different  | direction . He knew that the rules settled standings on fewest misses in the event of a tie . And the Russian had the fewest misses . Up went the bar to 6 feet 101/2 inches . Kelly stopped worrying when Kachkarov missed at that height for third place . But the amazing Porter cleared it as 60,000 Australians ; the diehards of the original capacity crowd , yowled in glee . Then Dumas cleared it , too . Darkness had begun settling down over the arena by that time as both knocked off the bar twice at 6 feet 11 ? inches . Neither could see the crosspiece distinctly because they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoreboard lights showing them the way . Then Dumas , sat down to pull on his light blue spiked shoes made of Australian kangaroo skin . Kangaroos also are good jumpers . He measured the distance , jogged up with gathering speed and put on the brakes . " Doggone , " muttered Charlie to himself . " That was a bad approach . I 'd never have made it . " He tried again . Up went his right foot . With a surge of power his left foot kicked clear . Over the bar he floated . He 'd made it . But wait . Porter still had one more try . However , the youngster from Down Under had been Up Over some three inches higher than he 'd ever gone before . He failed . Dumas was the Olympic champion . " It was wonderful , " babbled Dumas . " Porter was wonderful . Everything was wonderful . " It was a reasonably accurate estimate because the first four men in the event all surpassed the old Olympic record of 6 feet 8 ? inches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had adopted a new hero . He was Vladimir Kuts of Russia , who is either a Red Army officer or a Red Navy officer , depending on which interpreter did the translating . When the field lined up for the start of the 10,000-metre run ( six miles plus ) , the joint favorites were Kuts , holder of the world record for the distance , and Gordon Pirie , Britain 's unpredictable paint salesman who beat Kuts while setting the world 5,000-metre mark .  | No one was more aware of this than the corn-haired blond in the red jersey . He was so anxious that he almost committed the unforgivable sin of making a false start , an unthinkable breach of etiquette for so long a race . But he wanted the lead and he got it . The pace the Russian set was a scorcher . He reeled off lap after lap in time close to 61 seconds , a pace that good milers would consider spanking . But this guy was running more than six miles . Tightly tied to him by an invisible thread was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go a burst to open his margin and Pirie would have to sprint to match it . They fled past 3,000 metres in world record time and did the same at 4,000 metres . At the 5,000 metres the Soviet wonder was caught in figures equaling Emil Zatopek 's Olympic record of 14:06.6 . The man was n't human . Pirie began to think along those lines , too . Those unorthodox spurts were bothering the Briton seriously . Pointedly he refused to accept Kuts ' bait when the Russian moved wide into the second lane to let Pirie pass . The Englishman remained in line . Then Kuts moved wide again . This time he waved Pirie on with his left hand . The offer was refused . But then Kuts slowed down to walk and Pirie had to take the lead . Kuts watched him contemplatively . Then the Russian sprang his trap , the softening-up process completed . He raced past Pirie and raced completely away from him with five laps to go . The Britisher was a gone goose . He could n't even hold second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into eighth . " Kuts murdered me , " he moaned . " It was n't the fact that he beat me but the way he beat me that hurt . I hope I never have to run against anyone like him again . " Kuts was the winner by forty-five yards , waving a hand as he crossed the finish line in 28:45.6 , a new Olympic record . In a fast finish for the silver medal Jozef Kovacs of Hungary outhustled Allan Lawrence of Australia as both also went under the old Olympic mark . Kuts thus became the first Russian to get a gold medal in men 's track and field . It was noted that Kovacs , the Hungarian , pointedly avoided shaking hands with the Soviet ace . Four years ago at Helsinki Nina Ponomareva ( she then was Nina  | Romaschkova ) set an Olympic record in winning the discus . But few outside of Russia ever had heard of her until she made headlines in Britain for being light-fingered . Her theft of the cheap bonnets gained her a universal notoriety . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne and lead another Russian sweep . Nina broke her own Olympic record by two feet and that was n't sufficient because she finished a shocking third . The surprise victor was a buxom but pretty Czech , Olga Fikotova . She scaled the plate ? not a bad trick for a housewife at any time ? a distance of 176 feet 2 , some eight feet better than hatloving Nina 's old mark . Irina Begliakova , another Russian , was second , while a major shock came when Mrs. Earlene Brown , a 226-pound Californian , took fourth . The weight lifting competition also got under way and the United States produced the first two winners in Charles Vinci , bantamweight , and Isaac Berger , featherweight . But the most stunning development of the day occurred on the rowing course at Ballarat , seventy miles down the pike from Melbourne . The Americans had naturally taken for granted that the great Yale crew would make the usual sweep of the waters in the feature of the rowing . That 's the way it always happened . Maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale was money in the bank . Suddenly both Australian and Canadian crews cracked the safe . However , the big heist of Ballarat was perfectly legal . The two Empire crews whipped the huge American boatload in the firstround race with a thoroughness which made many despair . " I still predict that we 'll win the gold medal , " said Tippy Goes , the chairman of the American Olympic rowing committee . He tried hard to sound unlike a man whistling past the graveyard . He did n't succeed . And it was to be a few more days before anyone could test the accuracy of his remark because Yale was not eliminated completely . It could still qualify in the repechage or extra heat for losers . Before the day had ended Squadron Leader Hicks , the band leader , played his first national anthem in the Olympic victory  | ceremony . It was " The Star Spangled Banner . " And Dumas was the first champion to thrill to it . Actually he was one of the few to get a full rendition because Squadron Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopped off the end in a truncated version which would have horrified Francis Scott Key . The Australian Toscanini began to feel that he really was overdoing it on Saturday , the third day . There were five track and field finals . It was " Oh , Say Can You See " four times . This was the afternoon when the Russians refused to accept the three victory cakes they 'd ordered from a Melbourne caterer . So the Americans gleefully accepted them instead . The Comrades had been absolutely certain of winning the hammer throw , very certain of winning the 50-kilometre walk and reasonably certain of winning the broad jump . They goofed on all three . Mikhail Krivonosov of the Soviet had dominated the hammer throw during the interval between Olympics . He kept adding and adding distance to his world records until none could question his supremacy . At about the same approximate time that the Russian began his upward climb , Harold Connolly graduated from Boston College and then pasted a picture of Krivonosov on the visor of his auto windshield . His was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withered slightly since birth and he 'd broken it some four or five times since while wrestling or playing football . As an exercise for strengthening his arm he began throwing back the hammer to the regular hammer throwers at Boston College . " When I found I could throw it back farther than they could , I took it up seriously , " said the Boston Irishman . The improvement of this 220-pound six-footer was steady but not overwhelmingly spectacular . Then the 25-year-old history teacher found his groove this spring and he was charging on the record heels of the Russian . Soon they were taking turns in breaking the world record with Connolly getting in the last word with an unofficial new mark of 224 feet 10%z inches .  | Yet the consistent Krivonosov was the solid favorite to win . He acted as though he expected that triumph . " I 'll beat you , " said the Red to the Bostonian before the final . " We 'll see , " said Connolly cautiously . Yet he noticed that his rosy-cheeked rival was inordinately nervous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toss of 206 feet 8 inches , an Olympic record . But he was so jittery that he fouled all three of his last throws , falling out of the ring and never getting the hammer away in his final effort . Connolly fouled his first throw , which was his best by far . But then he used extreme care . It was on the fifth of his six throws that he sent the iron ball crashing into the turf 207 feet 3 inches for a new Olympic record . In fact all six place-winners broke the old mark of 197 feet plus . They went past it a total of fifteen times . First to congratulate the American was the rueful Krivonosov . Just before Connolly began to munch on the victory cake that the Russians had originally ordered , he announced that he was retiring from competition . He also said that he now could take down the picture of Krivonosov from the windshield of his car . It had no further value as a reminder because all Connolly 's goals had been achieved . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana who broad jumped 25 feet 81/4 inches to beat by half a foot his teammate , John Bennett , the Marquette alumnus . Although the sun heated up the temperature to 80 degrees , there was a strong , gusty wind blowing in the faces of the sprinters and broad-jumpers . It was so strong away from the stadium that most of the rowing races had to be postponed . Except for the two Americans the broad jumping was definitely inferior , presumably owing to the wind . But the wind had no effect on Norman Read , the black-uniformed New Zealander . He won the 50-kilometre walk in a breeze ? if you do n't mind the pun . Read received a warm ovation from the Aussies for his entire 31-mile journey and he was alone when he returned to the stadium after touring the countryside . Once he crossed the finish line , the New Zealander broke into a happy dogtrot . Then he had to wait fifteen minutes for the runner-up to  | arrive . He was Eygani Maskenskov , the Russian for whom the victory cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he finished . Most eye-catching of the day 's performers , perhaps , was Bobby Morrow , the 21-year-old sprinter from Abilene Christian College in Texas . The handsome youngster had been an electrifying figure in the final Olympic tryouts when he won both sprints . But a virus attack laid him low just before the Games and he was beaten in tune-up meets to the consternation of the railbirds . By the time the big show got under way , however , Morrow had regained the ten pounds he 'd lost and was back at a powerful 180 . His jowls flap , they say , when he 's running at his relaxed best . They flapped this day as the big Texan with the nine-foot stride glided over the track in the same effortless display of " floating power " which Jesse Owens once used . Morrow had four 100-metre races in all , three heats and a final . He did n't come close to losing one . In fact he seemed to loaf through a 10.3 heat which equaled the Olympic record . He did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no telling how fast he 'd have gone in the final if that wind had not been blowing up the straightway against the century finalists . As it was , Morrow was clocked in 10.5 . But he won by open daylight from Thane Baker of Kansas , the runner-up also at Helsinki . Hector Hogan of Australia interrupted an American Grand Slam by beating Ira Murchison for third place . " Nuts to the time , " said the happy Morrow . " I just wanted to win . " The Grand Slam came , surprisingly enough , in the 400-metre hurdles . This was an event on which the Russians had concentrated ever since the 1952 Games . Yuri Lituyev had broken the world record and kept lowering his own mark . But this event is not on the normal track meet schedule in this country , and Americans rarely bother with it until the Olympic year rolls around . Then it invariably attracts an odd assortment . One of the best Americans was Glenn Davis of Ohio State , an all-round athlete in high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went out for the hurdles " because there was no other way to make the team . " Another highly regarded prospect was Eddie Southern , an 18-year-old from the University of Texas . He 'd been a wondrous schoolboy sprinter but he knew that he could n't begin to match the blazing speed of our topflight Olympians . So he also went in for the 400-metre hurdles . It was in the semi-finals that Southern demonstrated how far he 'd come . He beat Davis in 50.1 for a new Olympic record . Yet both had previously skimmed over the sticks faster . In the final Olympic tryouts the 21-year-old Davis had done an incredible 49.5 with Southern hitting 47.7 while Josh Culbreath , a 23-year-old Marine , had qualified in 50.4 . That last time equaled Lituyev 's world marks . Some two hours later all four of these slick timber-toppers squared off for the Olympic championship . The tousle-haired Davis was in command of a superbly run race all the way . He also touched 50.1 but he was running scared ? by his own admission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stride for safety 's sake , he let out a burst of speed after clearing the last barrier . " When I crossed the finish line , " he said soulfully afterwards , " I just looked up to the sky and said , Thanks . ' " Southern was second and Culbreath third for an American Slam while Lituyev was fourth . The point score at this stage in the proceedings was 108 for the United States to 88 for Russia . These were completely unofficial , of course , and not especially important . There then was an off day , Sunday . Melbourne has almost a Victorian primness to it in many respects and does n't even print newspapers on the Sabbath . Naturally , there was no Olympic competition . But folks had a chance to do considerable thinking before Monday 's resumption and most of them began to be convinced that Russia 's Olympic threat was as empty as a Khrushchev vodka glass . By Monday evening the margin had widened to 172 to 107 . The race which made another huge Aussie crowd babble almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many respects this was the highlight of the entire Olympic foot racing  | program , an unforgettable thriller that dripped with drama and suspense all the way . Two Americans were slight favorites . One was Arnie Sowell , a slim half-miler from Pitt , who is a beautiful stylist with floating power . He 'd repeatedly defeated big Tom Courtney of Fordham for all major championships and the Olympic 800-metre title had been earmarked for him years earlier . Yet by the time of the final Olympic tryouts Courtney had come far . He 'd been able to train better in the Army than he ever had been able to train while studying at Fordham . He sharpened his speed in the National A.A.U. championships by winning the quarter-mile title in stunningly fast time . Then he outfooted Sowell in another scorching race to win the Olympic tryout event . Nor could the fleet Auden Boysen of Norway be overlooked . He was a great pace-setter and had done 1:46.4 for the distance in preOlympic competition . But so had Courtney . Sowell proved he belonged with 1:46.7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day when someone left the front door open and a chill wind bustled down the homestretch . Courtney went into the final with a consciousness that he had to beware of the dilemma on which he could become impaled . Both Boysen and Sowell had the early speed and he 'd have to stay close . But Derek Johnson of Britain , a solid Britisher with only a medium-sized international reputation , could be dangerous because he had an almost invincible closing burst . The big Fordhamite , 180 pounds of him , decided to take his dangers as they came . When neither Sowell nor Boysen showed any disposition to blaze the trail , he went out in front himself so as to take some of the sting out of Johnson later on . But then Sowell moved with feathery stride past Courtney in the backstretch of the first lap . A quarter of the distance had been traversed . The slim Pittsburgher stepped up the pace with Courtney falling grimly a step behind and with both Boysen and Johnson a stride or two in back . They still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halfway point , 400 metres , in the phenomenally fast fractional time of 52.8 . Not until they hit the turn for home at the head of the home-  | stretch did they shift positions . They fanned out . Courtney was in the third lane , outside of Sowell . In tortuous fashion he began to inch up . It was an agonizing effort , made even more so by the effortless way Sowell glided along . Then they were even . Then the big Fordhamite was a foot ahead , two feet ahead . The roaring crowd suddenly hit an even higher decibel content . Johnson , the little-regarded Britisher , had burst between the two Americans and had wrested away the lead with only fifty yards to go . Maybe Johnson was n't an Aussie but he was at least a cousin from the British Empire . The acclaim went thundering up from the stands . The greatest upset of the Olympics was in the making . Everyone knew that a runner ca n't make two sprints in the homestretch . Courtney already had made his and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious as Johnson pulled a yard in front . The most moving description of what happened thereafter came , oddly enough , from Courtney himself . ran out of steam thirty yards from the tape , " he said with a tired smile . " And then the Lord really helped me the rest of the way . I did n't seem able to gather myself from my usual stretch drive . I just kept lunging and lunging for the tape , wondering all the while why it never got any closer . " I was completely fagged out . My legs were like rubber . I did n't pass out at the finish but I could hardly stand up . I knew rather vaguely that I had hit the tape but to make sure I had won I asked Johnson . " The marvel of it was that Johnson knew because Courtney beat him by only a foot in the Olympic record time of 1:47.7 . It was an extraordinary finish to an extraordinary race . The Fordham boy had accepted defeat in his mind and yet his flaming spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten inadequate yards of the race remained when big Tom lashed himself into a superhuman effort . He was on the verge of a blackou hen courage alone flung him into an Olympic championshipi uch was his complete exhaustion that the victory ceremony had to be delayed an hour while the boy from Fordham reassembled his scattered faculties .  | When he climbed the victory pedestal , however , he was not flanked by Sowell as well as by Johnson . Boysen of Norway had done some homestretch charging of his own to snatch away the bronze medal from the Pitt youngster . But all four men broke Mal Whitfield 's once-proud record of 1:49.2 . Johnson was 1:47.8 , Boysen 1:48.1 and Sowell 1:48.3 . As a matter of fact the fifth man , the surprising Mike Farrell of Britain , equaled the old figures in fifth place while Lon Spurrier of the United States was only a tenth behind in sixth . There was nothing even approximately as dramatic about the pole vaulting of the Rev. Bob Richards , America 's defending champion . He 'd had his drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaulting vicar has had more fifteen-footers than any man who ever lived . Yet he almost flunked out at 13 feet 1 %2 inches , a height he normally can clear while carrying a suitcase in his hand . He was unconcerned when he first missed . Such accidents occa- , sionally will happen . So he did n't even put his pole down as he confidently awaited his next turn . He swooped easily down the runway and sailed over . But as he landed in the sawdust pit , the bar tumbled after . A look of utter consternation and dismay spread over his features . He was only one jump away from elimination at a height most self-respecting American schoolboys can clear . Richards talked anxiously to the officials . He conferred with Bob Gutowski , his teammate . He examined the ground and the vaulting slot . He stood there impatiently with the pole in his hand . But then his worried frown grew deeper . He dropped the pole and jogged around the track to limber up . He changed his shoes . He studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shook a cold bead of perspiration from his brow and cleared the ridiculously low height . When he had to do six inches higher a few moments later , he did it with nonchalant ease . After that unexpected taste of purgatory , the reverend found the finals a heavenly relief . He won as expected at the Olympic record height of 14 feet 111/2 inches and it was the cold , blustery wind which prevented him from attaining his normal 15-plus . Gutowski  | gave the United States second place at 14-10% while the Greek undergraduate at U.C.L.A. , George Roubanis , took the bronze . The day 's big whopper as a performance , though , came in the javelin throw . This was an event which had seen the record particularly vulnerable to assault ever since the last Olympics when a new model designed by Bud Held of the United States added to all distances . Just prior to the Olympics , Held 's world record ? Held himself failed to qualify for the American team ? was shattered by Janusz Sidlo of Poland at 274 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egli . Danielsen , a black-haired Norwegian electrician , had thrown within three inches of that mark . It was the 23-year-old Danielsen who electrified the crowd on his third-from-last toss . Out sailed his white spear past the chalk line marking the old Olympic record and past the line marking the world record . It came to a quivering stop at the unbelievable distance 281 feet 2% inches . This was as giant-size a mark as the Games were to produce . Sidlo was second , a Russian third , a German fourth and a Pole fifth , all with marks better than the Olympic standard of 242 feet that Cy Young set at Helsinki . Far out of the competition in eleventh place came Young , the defender . Giving the day a touch of added perfection ? at least to the Australian crowd ? was a heart-warming victory by Betty Cuthbert , the pert Aussie miss who won the 100-metre dash in 11.5 seconds . She thereby tied the Olympic record set by Margie Jackson , also from Down Under , at Helsinki . The weight lifters drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light-heavyweight championship for the United States but because the heavyweight competition also was staged that day . This was the one where America had entered Paul Anderson of Georgia , " The Strongest Man in the World . " But Anderson had his troubles with Humberto Selvetti of the Argentine . This was a stunner . The Russians had been so convinced that the round man from Georgia was so superior to anyone else they did n't even enter anyone against him . Yet Selvetti matched Anderson pound for pound as the en- p 300 thralled spectators watched in disbelief . When they had finished , it still was a tie in total poundage lifted . The muscle boys settle such ties by awarding the victory to the smaller man . This was the surprise to end all surprises . The 304-pound Anderson ? it was a shameful discovery ? was the smaller man . The Argentinian outweighed him by twelve pounds . That 's how Paul Anderson happened to win an Olympic championship . Onward the sweep continued as another day arrived . More triumphs were to come both from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any doubt about Bobby Morrow in the 200-metre sprint because he had just enough extra running room to obviate any chance of mistakes . So the winner of the 100 went on to score the first dash double since Jesse Owens at Berlin two decades earlier . The Texas powerhouse even gave it an additional flourish . Running with the same effortless rippling rhythm that Owens had once used , Morrow streaked to a one-yard victory over Andy Stanfield , the defending champion , in 20.6 , time which shattered the Olympic record that Owens had set in 1936 and that Stanfield equaled in 1952 . There even was something coincidental about the fact that the defending champion raced the metric furlong in the identical time for both Olympics . Once it was worth a gold medal . Four years later it earned only a silver . Thane Baker , second to Stanfield at Helsinki , was rudely pushed back to third place at Melbourne . However , it still added up to a Grand Slam for the United States . The order of finish in the 200 was in exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discus throw . The big favorite was Fortune Gordien , the Oregon cattleman , who was on three Olympic teams and who is the holder of the world record . Just before the finals began , Gordien let go a 198-foot practice toss . " Oh , oh , " said Al Oerter , a 20-year-old native New Yorker who was a junior at the University of Kansas . " The man is hot . No one will beat him for the Olympic championship . " So the 228-pound youngster was completely relaxed when he spun out his first throw . The platter scaled out 184 feet 11 inches . This was not only the longest toss Oerter had ever made in his life  | but it broke the Olympic record by more than four feet . It scared Oerter to death . " I just went to pieces , " he confessed with a grin afterwards . " My arm tightened up and my nerves were shot to blazes . " Apparently Gordien also felt the strain because he finished five feet behind the kid from Kansas while Des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected Grand Slam . There was nothing upsetting about the hop , step and jump . Adhemar da Silva of Brazil retained his Olympic title just as everyone expected he would . No one even raised an eyebrow when he triple-jumped 53 feet 7 %2 inches for an Olympic record . The major surprise came when Vilhjalmur Eirnarsson of Iceland ( his fellow undergraduates at Dartmouth call him ' Willie ) sailed out 53 feet 4 inches for second place , a mark that also was better than the old Olympic record . In the women 's broad jump a pigtailed gal from Poland , the 17-year-old Elzbieta Krzesinska , equaled her own world record with a leap of 20 feet 9% inches . Much more of a surprise was the achievement of Willie White of Tennessee State , also a 17-year-old , who shattered the American record by doing 19 feet 11% inches for second place . As spectacular as were the events at the Melbourne Cricket Ground this day , they could not command complete attention . Most of the sportswriters and most of the top-ranking officials ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ballarat and the shores of Lake Wendouree for the finals of the rowing . The shocking defeat of the Yale eight-oared crew in the first round had produced a totally unexpected feeling of uneasiness , although the Eli sweep-swingers had done handsomely thereafter to reach the final . Yet the Americans no longer were as supremely confident of success as they once had been . In honor of so momentous an occasion , the Aussies produced a glorious , sunshiny day and the 2,000-metre course was a shining ribbon of blue water that cut through the rushes which crowd the edges of the shallow lake . And the eight-oared final was to be worthy of its brilliant set-  | ting . There were four crews lined up at the start , the United States , Canada , Australia and Sweden , with only the Swedes disregarded as genuine challengers . After all , it had been the two British Empire boats which had swept past the Yale shell in the opening round . Bob Morey , the Eli stroke oar , set a beat of 34 at the start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fierce foemen . Even that was n't enough in the beginning , though , because Canada and Australia were the early leaders until the blue-tipped oars of the Americans cut past them at the halfway mark . Up shot the Yale stroke to a beat of 38 , killing off the rangy Aussie eight . Then they had to go up to 40 near the end to hold off the fastclosing Canadians . The Elis just made it . They gave everything they had and there was a mass collapse after they crossed the finish line . John Cooke at No. 3 keeled over and had to be treated in the hospital for exhaustion . Charlie Grimes at No. 6 was the real " engine room " of this crew , a 210-pounder who stands 6-foot-7 , but he slumped over until water was splashed in his face . The Yale victory certainly was no major surprise but it did set the tempo for the greatest day America ever had in Olympic rowing . Stanford graduates won both the pairs without coxswain ( Jim Fifer and Duvall Hecht ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kurt Seiffert ) . But for the third straight Olympics , failure again overtook Jack Kelly , Jr . The handsome brother of Princess Grace of Monaco was striving to emulate his distinguished father , the single sculls winner of 1920 . The best he could do was a bronze medal for third place , beaten by both Viktor Ivanhov , a 19-year-old Russian newcomer , and Stuart Mackenzie of Australia . Kelly tipped his Kelly-green cap to his conqueror and called it a career . " This is it , " said America 's finest sculler since his old man dominated the waves . " This winds me up . I 'd have liked that gold medal but the Russian was great , really great . " The point totals for the unofficial team championship had reached such one-sided proportions by this time that they stopped commanding headlines . At the end of the fourth day of competi  | tion it had leaped up to 262 to 150 . Few realized at the time that this was to be the widest margin the United States was to enjoy over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as America 's lead became 306 to 214 . Where Russian improvement was noticeable was on the brickred track . Vladimir Kuts , the 29-year-old Ukrainian , was out to show that his victory in the 10,000 was not an isolated dish of borscht . He also was going to seek the Woolworth double that Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia had achieved at Helsinki with triumphs in the five and ten . Kuts already had his ten , the 10,000-metre medal . Now he was about to go after the much tougher , much more elusive five , the 5,000-metre test . In it was Gordon Pirie of Britain , the holder of the world record . In it also were two other Britons , Chris Chataway and Derek Ibbotson , as well as Laszlo Tabori of Hungary . All three had burst through the four-minute mile barrier but were so much better at the longer distance that they eschewed the metric mile of 1,500 metres in favor of the 5,000 . This was an extraordinarily fast field . However , Kuts is as much an automaton as Zatopek ever was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was affected by the Bouncing Czech , but he 's no sleek picture runner . He has a waddling style with too much arm motion , but there is a remorselessness to him that almost is frightening . An observer senses that , if Kuts has to kill himself in order to kill off the opposition , he has enough suicidal dedication to run himself to death . Supposedly the Russian had crushed Pirie 's spirit with his murderous cat-and-mouse tactics in the 10,000 . This time Pirie had friends with him in Chataway and Ibbotson . They led the pursuit until Chataway faded away in the last half mile with stomach cramps to finish a most disappointed and disappointing eleventh . Kuts set a blazing pace . It was so fast that he fled past the intermediate point at two miles in the astonishing time of 8:47 . In the last half mile the Ukrainian waved a figurative farewell to his British pursuers , stretching his 15-yard lead to 40 by the bell lap and then doubling that margin to 80 yards at the wire .  | Far down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit was broken ? or so they said . For a man with a broken spirit , he still had plenty of fight . He came roaring up on Ibbotson , the lean Yorkshireman , and beat him out for second place . Milos Szabo of Hungary was fourth and Albert Homas of Australia was fifth . All five broke Zatopek 's Olympic record . Kuts broke it by twenty-seven seconds with a stunning 13:39.6 . " He 's a wonder , " commented Pirie . Then in a surge of generosity he added , " And if the track had n't been so soft , he 'd have broken my world record , too . He can do 13:20 . " Kuts thus became the second Russian male track and field victor in all Olympic history . Both , by the way , were named Vladimir Kuts . But a third was soon to appear on the scene . He was Leonid Spirine in the new event , the 20-kilometre walk . He crossed the line and then planted a kiss on his runner-up Antanas Mikenas . Both bussed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first Grand Slam . Unkissed , however , was Inessa Iaounzem of Russia who won the javelin throw ( female division ) with an Olympic record heave of 176 feet 8 inches . This was eleven feet beyond the mark set in 1952 by Mme. Dana Zatopkova . In the same afternoon , therefore , two historic husband-and-wife records disappeared , the ones that had been so lightheartedly attributed four years earlier to Czech and Double Czech . The Russians also achieved a major upset in the modern pentathlon , a five-sport competition which embraces riding , swimming , running , fencing and shooting . They could n't head off Lars Hall of Sweden for the individual championship but they had the balance to win the team trophy . The loudest cheering the Australian crowd did all day , however , was during the running of the women 's 80-metre hurdles . They had reason to cheer . Their own Shirley Strickland de la Hunty gave a smashing exhibition in defending her championship . Not only did she crack her own Olympic record but also her own world record with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games was much more subdued than usual , the spotlight hit twice with blinding glare . The first  | wearer of the Stars and Stripes that it struck had a familiar look to him . He was Parry O'Brien , the defending champion in the shotput . There was no more solid favorite in the games than the 230-pound Californian because he 'd not only become the first 60-footer in history but had even gone beyond 63 feet . O'Brien broke his Olympic record of 57 feet 1'h inches on his first throw . He was most apologetic . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I was very nervous . Besides , they gave me a brand new shot that was slippery . " The best he could do in the final round was a nervous 60 feet 11 inches . Pleased at winning , O'Brien still was disappointed that he had n't moved the record out near 63 feet . But he did lead the way to a Small Slam for the United States . Bill Nieder of Kansas was second and Ken Bantum of Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skobla of Poland who took the bronze medal . Most spectacular event of the day in many respects was the 110-metre high hurdles final . The only element of doubt to it was the identity of the American who would win . Barring an upset of cataclysmic proportions , it had to be either Jack Davis , the Southern California graduate , or Lee Calhoun of North Carolina College . Davis was the Navy lieutenant who finished an eyelash behind Bones Dillard at Helsinki as both were clocked in the Olympic record time of 13.7 seconds . On the road to Melbourne strange things happened to Davis . In the National A.A.U. championships , a tryout semi-final , he streaked over the sticks in 13.4 for a world record . But Calhoun defeated him in the final . Then they ran a dead heat in the final Olympic tryouts . Ten days before the Games a warm-up meet at Bendigo saw Davis hammer the world 120-yard record down to a phenomenal 13.3 . Never was a man sharper . Yet the Navy man could n't help but wonder if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just hope I do n't have another letdown as I did after that other world record , " he said uneasily . Strictly speaking , he did n't have a letdown . But the parallel was there . He knew it . Calhoun knew it . The Carolinian also knew that  | he 'd need a perfect start to hold off the fast-closing Davis . He got that perfect start . Furthermore they ran a perfect race . Neither as much as ticked a hurdle . What jump Calhoun got on the getaway , he lost to Davis ' ferocious drive from the last stick home . They finished only a thin , red whisker apart , both timed in the Olympic record time of 13.5 seconds . But who won ? " Congratulations , Lee , " said Davis , offering his hand . " You got it. , , It still was n't official . Only the photographs could split them . Davis was correct . Calhoun was the new Olympic champion . And a third place by Joel Shankle of Duke University made it still another Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the Olympic Games . The Australians probably never heard this Brooklynese word before , but a dispute is a dispute in any language . And the Aussies reacted to it with the same jeering disdain that Dodger fans have used from time immemorial . The 3,000-metre steeplechase is one of the most grueling events on any track program . The runners have to clear thirty-five obstacles in all , including the devilish water jump . And the further they travel the higher those barriers seem to grow and the more satanic the water jump seems to become . The favorite in this race was Sandor Rozsnyoi of Hungary , the holder of the world record . But Britain offered a stern challenger in Chris Brasher , a 28-year-old Cambridge University graduate whose principal claims to fame were that he 'd acted as a stalking horse for Roger Bannister in the first break-through of the fourminute barrier and that he 'd once been considered qualified for a Mount Everest climb . This had been an unusually thrilling steeplechase . The early leader was Ernst Larsen of Norway and he blazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took command . A half circuit later it was Seyon Rzhishchin of Russia at the head of the parade . Industriously working his way up from the rear while others were shuttling back and forth was Brasher . He eased into fourth .  | At the bell lap the Hungarian and Norwegian were abreast as they sailed over an obstacle around the turn . But Brasher was closing fast himself and he went over between them . Then he tore off in front and won by twelve yards from Rozsnyoi , Larsen , Heinz Laufer of Germany and Rzhishchin , all of whom were caught under the old Olympic record of 8:45.4 . Brasher set the new mark at 8:41.2 and the Australian crowd went wild at the success of a British Empire cousin . But in bustled a most officious official who charged that Brasher had interfered with Larsen over the turn . So the referee , who did n't know his business either , disqualified the Britisher . The howl of indignation from the spectators was as violent as any at Ebbets Field . At no time was Brasher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any interference . It was a summary court martial , Soviet model , without any review of the evidence . Jack Crump , the head of the British Olympic forces , lodged formal protest with the red-coated Jury of Appeals . " I honestly could n't remember such an incident , " testified Brasher . " You know how it is in the excitement of a race . " They knew . " I felt something bump against my left shoulder , " testified Larsen . " But it had no effect on the outcome of the race . " The Jury of Appeals unanimously restored the Olympic championship to Brasher . " Boy , it 's really hard to win these medals , " said the grinning Brasher when he formally was presented with his gold award . The most stunning upset of a bitterly cold and windy day was in the 400-metre final . This had been earmarked all along for Lou Jones of New Rochelle , New York , a Manhattan College graduate . He had won the Pan-American championship in world record time . He broke that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final Olympic tryouts . But Jones had the misfortune to draw the outside lane for a race that 's run with staggered starts . Hence he had no way of judging the whereabouts of any of the other finalists . So he reacted as a man  | of his experience never should have done . He burst off his starting blocks as fast as he could , heedless of pace . At 250 metres Jones saw a red-jerseyed streak out of the corner of his eye . It was Ardalion Ignatiev of Russia . " It made me freeze , " said Jones with a shudder later on . " Running in the outside lane , I never should see anyone coming so close to me , and it sort of frightened me . " The Manhattanite had a tremendous lead of eight yards on the field at that point . It obviously was too much and he immediately began to pay the penalty . He started to tie up . Out in front went Ignatiev as Jones faltered . But the Russian had been deluded by the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also had to pay . And along came Charlie Jenkins , an undergraduate at Villanova College outside of Philadelphia . The 22-year-old Jenkins had looked like a world-beater during the indoor season but would win nothing outdoors . He barely qualified for the team behind Jones and Jim Lea . When Lea was eliminated in a preliminary heat and when Jones started to fade in the final Jenkins certainly seemed a forlorn hope . Yet the youngster was equal to his challenge . He went whirling past Ignatiev some twenty-five yards from the wire and then had the strength , courage and speed to fight off Karl Haas of Germany whom he vanquished by a yard . The fading Ignatiev was tied for third by Zoitto Hellsten of Finland while the tiring Jones had to be content with fifth . The time of 46.7 was excellent in the light of the brutal headwind he had to buck down the stretch . Before Jones ever had a chance to congratulate Jenkins , the Villanova boy beat him to the conversational punch . " I 'm sorry you did n't run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerity . " I 'm both glad and sad at the same time . Oh , gee . You know what I 'm trying to say . " Jones gave him a bear hug . In view of the atrocious conditions the performances of America 's two best decathlon performers , Milt Campbell and Rafer Johnson , were decidedly on the sensational side . The massive Campbell ? he weighs 216 pounds and stands 6-foot-3 ? started operations  | in a nasty morning rain and finished in the chill dusk of a miserable day . A schoolboy phenomenon who was the runner-up to Bob Mathias at Helsinki , Campbell had been an end on the Indiana University football team before being summoned into the Navy . In the interval between Olympics he 'd concentrated on the hurdles and gained top rank . In fact , he barely missed qualifying as one of the 110-metre timber-toppers . Johnson also had been a schoolboy phenomenon and had broken the Mathias world record while a sophomore at U.C.L.A. His specialty had been the broad jump and he actually qualified as a leaper . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long jump at Melbourne , the injury impairing his effectiveness in the all-around . Campbell was never headed . He won the first event , the 100-metre dash in 10.8 seconds . Then he was a close second in the broad jump at 24 feet %8 inch ; first in the shotput at 48 feet 5 inches ; second in the high jump at 6 feet 2 % inches and second in the 400-metre run at 48.8 seconds . This gave him the eye-opening total of 4,564 points at the initial day 's halfway mark , a world record pace . Not far behind was Johnson with 4,375 as all others were outdistanced . Thus did the competition roll into another day . And Campbell rolled right with it . He sizzled over the sticks in his specialty , the high hurdles , in 14 seconds flat . That 's better than par for the course . Par is always a thousand points . Big Milt gathered in 1,124 . He took a second in the discus throw at 147 feet 63/4 inches and the press box experts gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a mockery of the competition with never worse than a second place in the first seven events . And then disaster overtook him . He cleared only 11 feet 1% inches in the pole vault for only 476 points . On the verge of tears , Campbell was inconsolable . " It 's my own fault , " he said in self-condemnation . " The runway was fast and I just neglected to correct my steps . It was my own stupidity . " All he could think of was that he 'd regularly done 12 feet 8  | inches . That would have been worth an extra 200 points . It would have meant a world record , too , even though he did n't realize it at the time . His javelin throw was a fair enough 187 feet 3 inches for 668 points . Then he headed for the killing 1,500-metre run , a murderous finale for exhausted athletes . His spirit was no more willing than his flesh at that stage . But Ian Bruce , an Australian , became both a friend in need and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time to go , " Bruce kept screaming at the big American . Campbell responded to the goad as best he could , staggering over the line in 4:50.6 for 330 points . It gave him a total of 7,937 points , fifty points better than Mathias ' Olympic record and a scant 48 under Johnson 's world mark . Costly indeed was the vaulting slip-up . In second place came Johnson with 7,587 while third went to Vassily Kouznetsov of Russia , the European champion , with 7,465 . Oh , yes . Campbell lost twelve pounds in the two days of decathlon strain . While the all-around men were still struggling against the weather and each other , the distaff division was settling a pair of finals . To the vast delight of the Aussie crowd , the 18-year-old Betty Cuthbert streaked off with the 200-metre dash in 23.4 , equaling the world and Olympic records . Betty is a lissome lass , which would be a far from adequate description for the other female winner . She was Tamara Tychkevitch of Russia , a Miss Five-by-Five . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Olympic record and thereby dethroned another muscle moll , Comrade Galina Zybina , who finished second . The first five in this event broke the Olympic record . This was a relatively light day on the track because of the decathlon but the foot racers , jumpers and hardware heavers were nearing the end of their competition . Other sports were attracting more and more attention while swimming made ready to leap to the center of the stage . The natators were even too impatient to await their turn . No sooner had the trials begun in the modernistic fairyland of glass and concrete which was the swimming stadium than records be-  | gan to go . Bill Yorzyk of the United States set a world record of 2:18.6 in the 200-metre butterfly preliminaries as ten men broke the Olympic record while qualifying . It was the first final , however , which was to serve as an ominous warning signal for the United States . American mermen and mermaids had pretty well dominated the waves from the time swimming and diving appeared on the Olympic program . Hence there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us huge blocks of points , no matter how we fared elsewhere . The 100-metre free style was a bit on the disillusioning side . The 21-year-old Jon Henricks of Australia outsprinted his two teen-age countrymen , John Devitt and Gary Chapman , to produce an unprecedented ? for Australia ? Grand Slam as all three went under the Olympic record of 57.1 seconds , Henricks doing 55.4 . The women 's 200-metre breast stroke , won by Ursula Happe of Germany , saw Mary Jane Sears of Washington beat her American record by a full second . What did it get her ? Seventh place . It was a real shock and a portent of what still was to come . The newspaper reports , which had ceased giving any emphasis to the U.S.A.-U.S.S.R. race for the unofficial team championship because it was so lopsided , suddenly began to become aware of it again . The Russians , scoring heavily in canoeing and pistol shooting , were closing in . America 's margin had shrunk to 350 to 266%2 . It was on the final day of the track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made its last big haul of the Games . It was a lovely day for a change and the temperature was up to 80 . The stands were jammed as they had not been jammed since opening day . The attraction ? The most obtuse blockhead Down Under knew the answer to that one . It was John Landy . Australia 's greatest national hero not only had followed Roger Bannister past the four-minute mile barrier but had broken Bannister 's record with his untouchable 3:58 . No man ever had run as many fast miles as the curly-haired butterfly chaser ? six under 4:00 . But a fortnight before the Olympics , Landy had run so badly in a tune-up meet that he moaned despairingly , " I 've had it . " ? The Aussies could n't have been more horrified if their island continent had sunk into the sea without a trace . Nor were their  | spirits revived when Landy qualified unimpressively in the slowest heat . After all , their idol was a runner rather than a racer . He did best against time , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , was to blaze so fast a pace no one could outsprint him . There never was a faster field in all history than the one which lined up for the " Olympic Mile , " the 1,500-metre run . Five of the ten men who had broken four minutes were in the test . They were Landy , Ron Delany of Ireland , Brian Hewson of Britain , Laszlo Tabori of Hungary and Gunnar Nielson of Denmark . One of the ten , Istvan Rozsavolgyi of Hungary , had not even qualified . The other four were spectators ? Roger Bannister , Chris Chataway and Derek Ibbotson of Britain and Jim Bailey of Australia . The field of twelve was so fast and so well matched that position meant little in the early going because the shuttling for places was constant . There was an awed hush from the vast crowd as the gun crackled the start . Hewson and New Zealand 's Murray Halberg broke on top . Delany was sixth , Landy ninth and Nielsen last . At the end of one lap Delany , an undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dead last . With the race half completed ? it 's 120 yards short of a regulation mile ? the last three in the test were three of the chief contenders , Delany , Landy and Nielsen . Up front it was Mery Lincoln of Australia , Halberg , Hewson and Stanislav Jungwirth of Czechoslovakia . Yet they were so tightly bunched that a ten-yard blanket could have covered them as the bell sounded for the final lap . Lincoln was the leader but Landy had begun his drive and glided into fourth place , a more strategically different race than he 'd ever before run in his life . The thrill-sated Aussies in the stands went wild . Delany pattered along in tenth position and none paid him heed . Suddenly he was worthy of notice . Hewson was leading in the backstretch when the 21-year-old Irishman , youngest man in the field , began to come . He never stopped . He zoomed into sixth in the straightaway and roared into third around the last turn . Then he was second to a real dark horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on came Delany with his feathery stride that , they say ,  | resembles a leprechaun flitting over the peat bogs in the moonlight . Seventy yards from the finish the Celt nailed the German and beat him by a smashing five yards in 3:41.2 , an Olympic record . Delany 's last quarter , by the way , was an unbelievable 54.2 seconds . Thunderous as were the plaudits he received , they were drowned out in the roars which greeted Landy 's courageous sprint ? never before did he show a sprint ? to clinch third place , inches away from Richtzenhain . Then came Tabori and Hewson as the first five men fled under the Olympic record . After the smiling Irishman crossed the finish line , he dropped on his knees , clasped hands together and bowed his head . Landy , puffing from his exertion , stood reverently behind him and waited for Delany to complete his prayer of thanksgiving . Then the Aussie helped the Galloping Gael to his feet and congratulated him most enthusiastically . " I think Delany could easily run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He combines stamina and speed to perfection . " " I would still be running miles in 4:05 if it were n't for John Landy , " said the grateful Irishman in a separate interview . " He taught me how to relax and make full use of my abilities . I owe everything to him . " The Delany triumph was only a left-handed victory for the United States because the points the American-trained collegian made went to Ireland . However , the United States gathered in both expected and unexpected points before the day was out . Most unexpected of all was the gold medal won by Mildred McDaniel of Tuskegee Institute in the high jump where she broke the world record at 5 feet 9 ? inches . All the railbirds knew in advance , however , that America would win both men 's relays . The 400-metre sprint team of Ira Murchison , Leamon King , Thane Baker and Bobby Morrow had the speed and baton-passing slickness to shatter the world record that had been untouched since the Olympians anchored by Jesse Owens set it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39.5 as Morrow , winning his third gold medal , beat the Russians by three yards . The Soviet quartet was surprisingly fast since it was caught in 39.8 , the old record .  | The 1,600-metre relay had been earmarked for the United States also . However , Lou Jones had run an indifferent anchor leg in the trials and had not run well in the 400-metre individual race . So Coach Jim Kelly juggled the order to take the pressure off the shaky Manhattanite and gave the honor of anchorman to Tom Courtney , the 800-metre champion . So Jones led off in 47.1 for a three-yard lead . Jess Mashburn held it with 46.4 and Charlie Jenkins , the 400-metre champion , blew the race apart with 45.5 for a ten yard lead . Courtney yielded not an inch as he did 45.8 for a sparkling 3:04.8 . The third relay of the day , the women 's 400-metre test , went according to the form charts . The Australian team that was anchored by Betty Cuthbert broke the world 's record with a 44.5 performance . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great events of every Olympics is the marathon . Three times in the 1948 and 1952 Games a swarthy , Algerian-born Parisian , Alain Mimoun , had been balked of victory by that indefatigable running machine , Emil Zatopek . So the 36-year-old Frenchman entered his first ? and last ? marathon . He won it . What 's more , he beat Zatopek at long last and left the aging Czech in sixth place . When the dark-visaged Frenchman with the fierce black moustache entered the stadium at the marathon 's end , no pursuers were in sight . He indignantly waved aside officials who held blankets outstretched before him just beyond the finish line . His winning time was 2 hours 25 minutes . The crowd cheered him wildly but Zatopek got just as big an ovation when he cheerfully made his appearance . For the first time in his life the bouncing Czech seemed to be running merely for fun and he was enjoying himself thoroughly . That ended the track and field phase of the program , the hub around which the entire Olympics revolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty-four gold medals in the men 's events and one in the women 's for an unprecedented total of sixteen . Yet even on the day the track and field operations ended , all was not serene . Bob Clotworthy won the dive and Bill Yorzyk won the 200-metre butterfly , both for the United States . But Aus-  | tralia 's gal free stylers were just as swift as their male counterparts had been earlier in the 100-metre sprint . Dawn Fraser , Lorraine Crapp and Faith Leech produced a Grand Slam with Miss Fraser setting a world record of 62 seconds flat . At Helsinki the Americans had taken five boxing titles but at Melbourne they got only two , Jim Boyd , light heavyweight , and Pete Rademacher , heavyweight . The United States basketball team slaughtered the Russians in the court final , 89 to 55 . However , the United States was running out of events in which it had any chance of scoring points . In wrestling , for instance , the Soviet tallied 37 points to win while America finished a rousing last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minor league competition . As everyone paused for a rest on a rainy , cheerless Sunday the statisticians tabulated the unofficial points . The count read : United States , 463 ; Russia , 3901/2 . On Monday , with five days of competition left , the margin faded to 468 to 419 %2 as gymnastic points began toppling into the Soviet basket . The feature swimming event was the 800-metre relay where Australia 's youthful wonders ? Kevin O'Halloran , John Devitt , Murray Rose and Jon Henricks ? not only won easily from the United States but gave their performances the extra flourish of a world record , 8:23.6 . A ten-point pick-up marked the Red advance on Tuesday as the totals reached 490 to 452 ? . Mrs. Patricia McCormick gave the United States its twenty-ninth gold medal by retaining her title as springboard diving champion . But in the 400-metre free style America 's George Breen swam the fastest race of his life and discovered that it earned him only third place . The winner was the 17-year-old Murray Rose of Australia in the Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world record . It was on Wednesday that the Reds drew within twenty points of the Americans , 538 ? to 5181/ . But there was some comfort for the wearers of the Stars and Stripes . Shelley Mann of Arlington , Virginia , led Nancy Jane Ramey and Mary Jane Sears in a Grand Slam of the 100-metre butterfly in the Olympic record time of 1:11 . A British girl , Judy Grinham , won the 100-metre backstroke by an eyelash from 16-year-old Carin Cone of
