Great Britain and France won War II 's biggest victory last week , but the scene of success was neither at the front nor on the sea nor in the air , but rather in quiet , faraway Ankara , capital of Turkey , 1,600 miles from the guns of the Western Front . There , 25 years almost to the day after Sultanate Turkey had entered World War I on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary , a new Turkey , now republican in form , signed a treaty with Britain and France which made the onetime enemies allies-on condition . <P> An intricate affair sprinkled throughout with " ifs , " the treaty provided that : 1 ) all three nations will go to the others ' help in case of war in the Mediterranean ; 2 ) Turkey will aid Great Britain and France in honoring their guarantees to protect Greece and Rumania . Big condition in the treaty was the provision , made in an adjoining protocol , that Turkey would not be compelled to war against Soviet Russia . <P> Behind the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intrigue , the threat and promise of arms . Undoubtedly assisting French Ambassador Ren Massigli and British Ambassador Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen in their talks with Turkish statesmen was the fact that they could promise an immediate large credit . Impressive also to practical-minded Turks must have been the fact that in nearby Syria that old French Near East campaigner , General Maxime Weygand , had collected an imposing Army of 50,000 Frenchmen and that farther south in Jerusalem Lieut. - General Archibald Percival Wavell , who during War I was a British liaison officer to the Russian Imperial Army fighting the Turks , commanded a force of 60,000 Britons . Both these veterans came to Ankara to help their Ambassadors explain that Turkey , unlike Poland , would not be left to fight Germany alone should she sign up with Britain and France . <P> More complicating and difficult was Soviet Russia , with whom Turkey had enjoyed 20 years of uninterrupted friendship . For three weeks before the alliance was finally signed Turkish Foreign Minister Shokru Saracoglu had been in Moscow . In between visits to the Soviet Agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissar Viacheslav Molotov , who was just then also heavily engaged in conversations with various Finns , Estonians , Lithuanians , Letts . <P> What Comrade Molotov demanded of M. Saracoglu was kept veiled in Oriental secrecy . A good guess was that the Soviet Union wanted Turkey to : 1 ) close and keep closed the Dardanelles to belligerent warships-an action which would prevent Allied aid to Rumania ; 2 ) give active assent to Russia 's snipping Bessarabia and Bulgaria 's snipping Dobruja off Rumania . <P> M. Saracoglu refused all demands , and at length departed , with Soviet and Turkish flags decorating the Moscow station , a band alternating between the Internationale and the Turkish national anthem and a courteous Soviet communique announcing that the two countries still retained their friendship . Later , however , the Moscow newsorgan Izvestia ominously hinted that Turkish-Russian relations had soured . At the same time in Ankara , German Ambassador Franz von Papen entrained for Berlin , there to explain to Fiihrer Hitler why he had failed to win the Turks away from the Allies .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
