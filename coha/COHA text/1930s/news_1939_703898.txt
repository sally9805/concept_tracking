txt Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia , appearing before nearly 9,000 persons in Public Hall here today with Dr. Eduard Benes , former President of CzechoSlovakia , joined a tribute to the republic 's founder , Thomas G. Masaryk , with a vigorous denunciation of Adolf Hitler and the German " kidnapping " of the republic three weeks ago . " We are here to hail the ever-living Republic of Czecho-Slovakia , " the Mayor said . " As long as my government continues to recognize that republic , I shall continue to do so . " Czecho-Slovakia has not been captured . She has been kidnapped . When a kidnapper talks of a ' protectorate ' he means that he prgitects the kidnapped child until he gets his ransom or until he murders his victim . An international kidnapping is no different from an individual one . " Mr. La Guardia invited comparison of the " calm , logical , deliberate statement of the statesman , Dr. Benes , " with the " crude , callous , bombastic utterance of the head of the German Government made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilhelmshaven speech . " Side by side are the philosophy of a statesman and the hope of an international gangster , " he said . " I base that on what the gentleman in the brown shirt says himself , and I use the word gentleman only because there are ladies present . " La Guardia Praises Masaryk In a tribute to Mr. Masaryk , Mayor La Guardia said that the founder built a nation out of conditions created by 300 years of Habsburg attempts to " stimulate and provoke " hatreds among peoples of the same blood . " Dr. Benes has told you that Nazi Germany could not tolerate the existence of a prosperous State on its border . He expressed it in diplomatic language . In order that Berlin may understand , may I say that crime can not live surrounded by respectability . " The Mayor said that Chancellor Hitler " frankly conceded " that Germany needed food and raw materials and would have to have these supplies . " We have no quarrel with the law-abiding , decent German people , " he continued . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the government before the war and from Hitler 's regime on . He they must suffer ! No opportunity of protest , working long hours . No wonder his Wilhelmshaven speech was cut off . He was telling the world how good they were . They ought to know . " Mr. La Guardia said that America could prevent war by letting the world " know that we reserve the right to put the finger on the aggressor nation , and by giving aid and comfort to the nations who are defending democracy . " " To whom shall we sell arms ? We can use the same policy as In New York  --  issue pistol permits . " The Mayor quoted the statement of Sumner Welles , acting Secretary of State , in refusing to sanction the annexation of Czecho-Slovakia by Germany , and ended : " As a nation we have seen the birth of this baby republic . We have seen it grow up Into a sturdy nation in twenty short years . We want to breathe into its nostrils and bring it back to life again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in Prague . " Benes Predicts Victory CLEVELAND , April 2 . ? Dr. Benes and Mayor La Guardia , meeting on common ground today , described the European situation as far more critical than it was in 1914 but expressed the belief that a re-establishment of Czecho-Slovakia was certain . " The victory will come , " said Dr. Benes , who was second president of the nation . " It will be the victory of a free Europe . " Dr. Benes withheld an announcement , expected by some of his audience , outlining plans for maintaining remnants of Czecho-Slovakia in nations outside that territory itself . One associate said that the plan might encompass virtually a provisionary government , with headquarters in one of the embassies refused to German emissaries . This source said that Dr. Benes was awaiting the removal of certain impediments before outlining the , situation . In this connection , Thomas Sidlo , Cleveland attorney who presided at the meeting , said that he was informed of the " compelling " reasons which forced Jan Masaryk to forego today 's meeting and sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divulge them . Mr. Masaryk , son of Thomas Masaryk , was Prague 's former Ambassador to London . " It seems that Czecho-Slovakia was too successful , too prosperous , too democratic from the viewpoint of its totalitarian neighbors , " Dr. Benes told the audience , much of which was of Czech or Slovak descent . " Dictatorship can not afford to have a successful democracy in a near-by State . " Dr. Benes declared that there was " no conciliation possible between Masaryk 's ideas and the spirit of his free people on the one hand , and the German Nazi regime of today on the other hand . " " I am not suggesting that we meet brute force with brute force , " he added . " But the world is beginning to see that an end must be put to such moral and social disintegration as we see it now in certain States in Europe , or our civilization will perish . " Frequently applauded , , like Mr. La Guardia , Dr. Benes was hissed and interrupted by one spectator , a WPA worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . Subdued , he said that he wanted to ask Dr. Benes " What did you ever do for Slovakia ? "
