txt When Larry Gould , Byrd 's second in command in the Antarctic , went to a camera shop in New York to buy supplies for a hip to Soviet Russia , they tried their best to stuff his pockets with I0-mm. newsreels ? of the Coronation , the Hindenburg , even a couple of reels centeling on the Duke of Windsor  --  just as though Mr. Gould were n't headed for a place u here a newsreel is born every 60 seconds ! But it shows what is going on , in the way of preparation to supply a public demand for up-to-date films . And for Eugene W. Castle 's part , the sooner people realize that , while it is fun to have reels of home movies of Junior from the age of one day , to date , it Is not only fun but painlessly educational to possess libraries of contemporaly news events , which can be added to from stock , In Band 10-mm. sizes and projected at home . Mr. Castle has the satisfaction of being a pioneer in the field to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news- reel , for amateur consumption . The *lea came to him when he got a look at figures showing how many home projection machines were being sold . He mulled the thing over , being a careful man who would rather plan what he is going to do ahead , than make a lot of mistakes and have to go over the same ground twice . He was just about to go to bat with a newsreel of the life of George VI when the Hindenburg incident came along , so he went through with the arrangements for the Coronation but prepared a Hindenburg reel especially edited which would trace the historic significance of the gi eat ship , but lack all the unhappy details of her untimely end . A week after the Hindenburg went down , 18,000 camera supply stoles all over the United States had on hand both silent and sound reels , 8-nnd 16-mm. size and , lo , almost before you could open the telegrams , 0,000,000 feet of film had been sold . Then , when the figures were tallied on the Coronation reel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold . The one about the Duke of Windsor is still popular . With that test all spread out on the table to look at , Mr. Castle- had to decide where he 'd go from there . Since It was clear that people would take newsreels home jf.tbey , could get them , he made standing arrangements with two companies , under an agreement stipulating anonymity , to supply him with staff-taken pictures . In addition , he threw a force of his own men into the field of newsreels , two with roving assignments in and ' around New . York ; three to the West Coast , two in Chicago , one down South , and another overseas quick as a flash to London . Then , like others before him , Mr. Castle had to find a title for his project . Ever since Roy Larsen and his associateS set a new high in pat phraseology with their March of Time , title-choosing has taken on new impottance . Mr. Castle picked " News Parade . " There will be additions td the newsreel library at intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been laid down for a treasury of 65 educational and travel subjects , likewise 8- and 16-mm. size , for release through next season . It seems that people buy newsreels from September to the end of Mny . In the summer , presumably , they 're off , making their own movies . Mr. Castle was in on the original fabrication of Fox Movietone News , so he knows what he is about , when he goes to work making newsreels . Eighteen years ago he found himself with the sum of $500 which he ear11 ; : stly desired to turn into capital to finance himself in business . He dug up a railroad president on the Pacific Coast who thought pretty highly of his railroad , and he gave Mr. Castle a commission to say that it was a good one , in pictures . He did n't make an awful lot of money on his original investment , but he earned elbow room , in which to branch out into making 35-mm. pictures of about , every conceivable moving picture subject . Since the Wilt Hays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18-nun. films for school classrooms , it is clear that Mr. Castle has a good idea . Jack Connolly and Courtland Smith  --  who used to be with Pathe News  --  have said they were going into the field to open a chain of theaters which would show newsreels on 10-mm. stock . In the fall , a commercial movie house In New , York- , the World ? is spit g to be equipped to show 16-mm. feKture length pictures made by amateurs ' : . Mr. Castle thinks that , for every newsreel of his that goes for , family entertainment , the family will eventually tam out one reel of its own . It wo n't hurt the commercial moving picture theater business , because there is nothing in this world so avid as a lot of amateurs , when they have got hold of a new idea and want to learn the fine pants . The commercial theater will be able to supply the visual evidence of those fine points for yeais to come .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
