In every part of the Reich , long lines of workers formed last week at the local branches of German Labor 's KdF ( Strength through Joy organization ) . The day had come when they could sign up to buy a luxury never before available to European peasants and proletarians : a motor car . Since Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 , he has driven the conservative tycoons of the German automobile industry frantic by demanding that they produce a really cheap " People 's Car . " Last May he finally took the job away from them and at Fallersleben laid the cornerstone of a factory nearly two miles long by a mile wide , " The Largest Factory of Any Kind in Europe . " This plant is not scheduled to turn out cars until winter after next , but when orders were accepted last week , German workers scrambled so eagerly to sign on the dotted lines that in a few hours every KdF order blank in the Reich had been used up . <P> While more blanks were being printed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying for cars in blocs of 100 through KdF leaders . All who signed have to begin at once paying installments of five marks ( $2 ) per week toward a car which is to cost about $400 , and no interest will be paid on the weekly deposits . If 1,000,000 of Germany 's workers subscribe , $104,000,000 will pour in to help build the KdF factory . Meanwhile , batches of apprentices , supplied with free board &; lodging , are in training for the " high honor " of working in the new factory . <P> Dr. Robert Ley , leader of the German Labor Front , bubbled with enthusiasm , even foresaw the use of People 's Cars as Nazi baby buggies : " Within ten years every German who works will or can be the owner of a KdF car . No manna falls from heaven ! If you want socialistic advantages you must work for them . National Socialism is not weakly but manly Socialism ! We hope the KdF car will even raise the German birth rate by encouraging German families to have four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the first section of the KdF factory , which will have an annual production of 450,000 cars , will have a roof over its head ! " Taking his cue from the KdF car , radiorating Minister for Propaganda &; Public Enlightenment Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels announced last week that on Sept . <P> 1 , 1938 , he will have ready for sale 100,000 People 's Radios at 35 marks ( $14 ) each . This is cheap for a good small set in Europe , where the price of radios is everywhere so high that people continue to use antique models . " We now have 9,500,000 radio sets*-which is 5,500,000 more than before Adolf Hitler became Chancellor , " declared Dr. Goebbels . " Now , with the new People 's Radio , we shall become the greatest radio country in the world ! " Technicians who have inspected the People 's Radio say it has been designed to give poor reception of distant i.e. , foreign stations , is primarily intended to confine listening as much as possible to German stations . <P> *The estimated number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has a 77% greater population than Germany ) is 37,000,000.
