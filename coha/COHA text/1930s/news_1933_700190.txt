Samuel Seabury , chairman of the , Fusion campaign committee , speak- ' ing at two Fusion rallies in Brooklyn , made the direct charge that Mr. , with former State Senator John A. Hastings of Brooklyn , also known as the " boy friend " of former Mayor Walker , had furthered the Equitable , bus deal . Earlier in the day he asked Mr. if , while President of the Board . Aldermen , ) 11 ) bjadnot relzieteted former Otte ; 4Xarainer , Francis T. , in return for an agreement by the latter to withdraw an affidavit in which he had made serious charges against Mr. . Mr. lost no time in denying the statement . LaGuardia , Repeats Attack . F. H. LaGuardia , Fusion nominee for Mayor , addressed two audiences in Manhattan during the day and four in Brooklyn at night . He defined his educational program at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Progressive League at the Town Hall Club , Mr. LaGuardia returned to the Willard case despite the assertion of Mr. Seabury the night before that Secretary of State Edward J. Flynn and Mr. must be acquitted of all blame in connection with the suicide of Louis H. Willard . The nominee reiterated that both Flynn and were identified with the Bronx County Democratic machine , which had created a situation that led to Willard 's taking his life . " Ed Flynn was the boss of the machine in the Bronx , " Mr. LaGuardia said . " Conditions there could not exist without his knowledge and must have been known to Joseph V. . The vicious political system that now exists there is responsible for everything that has happened in the Bronx , including the Willard case . Let us not quibble about words or confusion of names . It is a vicious , cruel system . " Politicians have a code , just like the underworld . Their code says : ' Thou mayest steal but not squeal . ' That is the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flynn , Bronx Commissioner of Public Works , whom Willard accused of persecuting him and . Regardless of what they say , that is the issue . " Scoffs at " Red " Charge . Mr. LaGuardia also replied to Mr. 's attack upon him as a radical of the Moscow school . " Mr. has a radical obsession , " the Fusion candidate said . " It is typical of the untrained mind which has our , a veneer of learning . He has had that obsession all his life . He even regarded woman suffrage as radical . By this time he should have grown up and ought to know better . Mr. was selected as head of the Recovery party 's slate because he could be depended upon to stay put . He stayed put for seven years as President of the Board of Aldermen . " It was said yesterday in Fusion circles that the last had not yet been heard of the case . Mr. " Seabury framed his veiled charge against Mr. in the form of a question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a fact that the real reason he reinstated Mr. was that Mr. served upon him an affidavit in which he made serious charges against Mr. ? Is it not a fact that upon rMr. 's agreement not to file the affidavit , Mr. reinstated him ? " " ft is absolutely , untrue , " said Mr. , when the question was outlined to him . When asked whether he would accede to Mr. Seabury 's demand that he tell why he reinstated Mr. , he said : " My answer , I have given you . I will stand on my answer to Mr. Seabury 's question . " Mr. Seabury in his statement referred to the Willard case when he said : " The attempt to garble and misinterpret Mr. LaGuardia 's statement is only an attempt to inject another false issue into the campaign . " Equitable Bus Challenge . Returning to his attack on the Recovery party candidate in the evening , Mr. Seabury , in an address prepared for delivery at the Brooklyn meetings at the Erasmus Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Board of Estimate Mr. had voted for the Equitable bus franchise . " The Equitable bus franchise , " he said , " was an attempt by a group of politicians to monopolize the franchise wealth of this city . They figured on a profit of $19,000 , - 000 in the first few years . It failed only because the Transit Commission refused to grant it a certificate of convenience and necessity , after its investigation showed that it was a financial cripple . " It is no fault of Mr. 's that the plan did not succeed ; he did all in his power to help it . I have asked him time and again since this campaign started to state what justification he claims there was for his vote in favor of that grab . Instead of answering that question , he has ignored it and , as a substitute , he has introduced various irrelevancies in an effort to obscure and becloud the question which I have put to him . " The reason he does not answer it is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same lame excuses that Hastings and Walker gave in the investigation and that Walker repeated before Governor Roosevelt , all of which were shown to be fictitious . The Equitable bus franchise grab is one of the big blots on our political history . It reflects upon everybody who participated in it , and was one of the principal participants . " McCooey Downfall Predicted . Mr. Seabury declared the people of Brooklyn were becoming aware of the fact that the McCooey organization was largely responsible for the evils in the city government . fie predicted that on Nov. 7 the voters " are going to rise in their might and throw all the politicians who have plundered them , including McCooey 's pawns , out of office . " " That furnishes an awful prospect for McCooey , " Mr. Seabury said . " His opportunity to plunder through'controlled political officials is about to come to an end and he is desperate . His strategy now is to save from the wreck at least some little crumb if he can . He is concentrating all his energies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The office he is seeking furnishes more opportunities for political favoritism than any other . " Mr. Seabury said that the fact that no evidence was presented against Mr. Hesterberg before the Hofstadter committee was no proof that he had properly administered his office . He added that Brooklyn should have received more attention in the inquiry than it did . " Mr. ? Hesterberg 's record is certainly not one upon which he can ask re-election , " said Mr. Seabury . " He always has been and still le merely the tool of John . H. McCooey , a political spoilsman whose leadership consists in running the government wherever he can , not for the benefit of the people , but for the enrichment of the politicians and the filling of their tin boxes . " As opposed to such a type of candidate , consider the candidate offered to you by the Fusion party , Mr. Ingersoll , a man of unimpeachable character , whose knowledge of the wants and needs of the people of Brooklyn is second to none . If you entrust to him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rest confident in the conviction that he will administer its duties with an eye single to the public good . " For rotten , 13artisan , machine government , which is what the people of Brooklyn have had , you will have clean , nonpartisan government , administered by a man who represents the highest type of public servant which the city is able to offer . I urge the independent voters not to divide their votes between Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Joseph J. Baker ( Recovery party candidate , but to throw the full support of the independent sentiment of this great borough in favor of the man most worthy to receive it  --  Raymond V. Ingersoll . " LaGuardia on the Schools . equipped and ' zealous teacher could not depart except to risk punitive measures against him . " The conditions ' which prevail in our public schools-are merely a part of the political system which Fusion is fighting , " he said . " Neither a Curry-McCooey ticket nor a FlynnFarley ticket , for all the highsounding phrases which the heads of these tickets may utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonpartisan and purely educational basis . " At Our Lady of Peace School Hall , Mr. LaGuardia prefaced his speech by a declaration that he would refuse to descend to " mudslinging . " " The condition of the city is of such great importance to the people that have a real unselfish interest is its.welfare and it means so much to a million families in New York City that I refuse to be dragged down to the low level of a mudslinging campaign , " the candidate said . " Mr. can not separate himself from the political machine sponsorship and his associations with machine politicians during his entire political life . The people of this city are interested in saving their city by a new administration ? and that means a Fusion administration  --  and what this will do is the one big interest with the business men , taxpayers , rentpayers , workers and the unemployed and even with the 1,000,000 school children . of our city . " Mr. LaGuardia and his fellowcandidates , W. Arthur Cunningham and Bernard S. Deutsch , were warmly acclaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was estimated that , including the outside crowds , some 14,000 persons heard the Fusion candidates speak . Every hall was crowded . The nominee for Mayor told all his audiences that unless Mr. ' Ingersoll was elected Borough President of Brooklyn , he would regard a victory for himself barren . He returned again and again during his Brooklyn tour to his defense of what he had said regarding the suicide of Willard . Mr. LaGuardia announced that he would announce his financial program , including a plan to handle tax arrears , at a meeting in Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening . At the Fusion headquarters it was declared that assertions that Republicans were flocking to the Recovery party were without foundation . It transpired that for the first time in a decade or more the Republicans have been making a partial pre-election canvass in the city . James Marshall , Fusion campaign manager for Manhattan , said that the first survey made had shown Mr. LaGuardia to have unusual strength in districts that normally returned a large Tammany plurality , but not so strong in districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side . A canvass made since the controversy over the article dealing with Jewish attendance in the public schools , it was said , had revealed an increase in the LaGuardia strength all over the residential areas on the West Side . Clergymen Back Fusion . The Fusion campaign committee made public last night an appeal . issued by clergymen how organizing a nonpartisan committee in support of the Fusion ticket . " Every principle of civic decency , every high standard of moral life , all the welfare and happiness of our citizens depend upon the rescue of the city government from the machines , " the appeal said . The signers include the Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick , the Rev. Stephen S. Wise , the Rev. John Howard Melish , Bishop Francis J. McConnell , the Rev. John L. Elliott , the Rev. John Howland Lathrop , the Rev. Edmund Chaffee and the Rev. James W. Brown . Joseph M. Price , chairman of the Independent Fusion Committee , declared that the destiny of the city , for the next decade at least , would be determined at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonpartisan character of the Fusion movement , the election of whose candidates , he said , would result in twelve Democratic votes and only four Republican votes in the next Board of Estimate . This , he declared , was proof that neither State nor national politics had entered Into the calculations of the Fusion Leaders . " Fusion has one enemy onlyPammany Hall , split in two , one part in control , the other part seeking control ; the political ideals of both parts are the same , " Mr. Price said . " New York City can be releemed only by a group opposed to that sort of municipal politics . " Philip Bongiorno , Supreme Master of the American Sons of Italy , leclared in a letter to Albert Ot ; inger , former Attorney General , that this organization was the only Fraternal organization of ItalianAmericans with which Mr. LaGuarlia had been affiliated . The letter ienied a statement by Mr. Ottinger n a speech for the Recovery party that the Fusion nominee had been expelled for being a political " red . " Mr. LaGuardia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall and Bay Ridge High schools , Arcadia Hall , and Our Lady of Peace School Hall , all to in Brooklyn . He pledged himself to the establishment of a nonpartisan Board of Education , the abolition of the Board of Superintendents and the shifting of its functions to a Superintendent who would be the chief administrative officer of the department , the appointment of an advisory educational council and a survey of the public school system with a view to remedial legislation . Boys and girls in the public schools , Mr. LaGuardia said , had been made the " victims of political adventurers . " Corruption and dishonesty , he declared , permeated the administration of the public schools . " Large sums have gone to jobholders , grafters and boodlers , " he said . " In the selection of school sites and in the purchase of supplies political enemies have been punished and friends rewarded . For similar reasons useless administrative posts , carrying huge salaries and bonuses , have been created . School funds have been used in the building of a political machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This I pledge to stop . " Mr. LaGuardia declared that deadening mediocrity had been established as a standard inl the public schools from which the well
