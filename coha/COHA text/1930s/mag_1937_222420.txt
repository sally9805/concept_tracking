Before boarding the Zeppelin Hindenburg for Europe , passengers used to wait in a bare , high-ceilinged room at the Lakehurst , N. J. Naval Air Station . Fortnight ago when fire destroyed the Hindenburg at Lakehurst ( TIME , May 17 ) , this chamber became a temporary morgue and 26 corpses lay there for two days awaiting identification and burial . Last week a Federal board of three investigators* and a crowd of newshawks sat down in the same room hopefully awaiting some clue to the disaster 's cause . At week 's end they had not found it but they had listened to a mass of testimony of which two highlights were Commander Charles Emery Rosendahl , head of the Lakehurst base , and Werner Franz , the Hindenburg 's twelve-year-old cabin boy . <P> On the stand , Commander Rosendahl woodenly reviewed the course of the disaster , confessed he was mystified by it . Afterward he unbent to reporters , uttered thoughts that must have rushed through many heads when the 803-ft. airship suddenly spouted flame : <P> " When I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also thought that there would immediately be an explosion which would flatten every building at the field and kill everybody looking on . I thought it was curtains for all of us . " <P> Rumple-headed Werner Franz was caught by a sentry while trying to get away with a bit of metal from the wreck . Brought into the inquiry , he revealed one of the most amazing escapes of all . Cornered on a narrow catwalk when the gasbags all around him leapt into flame , young Franz jumped through the fabric , fell to earth so hard he was stunned . He would have burned to death as the blazing hulk settled upon him , but a ballast tank burst above him , drenching him with cold water which both revived him and extinguished his burning clothes . Unharmed , he groped his way to safety . <P> Other aftermaths of the disaster last week : <P> Three members of the New York Police bomb squad declared after probing the wreck that they could find no evidence of sabotage . <P> On a North German Lloyd-Hamburg-American pier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 28 flag-draped coffins while a U. S. Navy blimp circled overhead . <P> Capt . Max Pruss of the Hindenburg was declared out of danger , but other crew members remained in a serious condition , and one more passenger died at the Paul Kimball Hospital at Lakewood , N. . , bringing the death total to 36 . <P> A week after the fire officials chugged down New York Bay to meet the Europa , bringing sad-eyed Dr. Hugo Eckener to help the investigation . Saying little , the world 's No. 1 airship expert poked about the twisted girders of his greatest zeppelin , talked to survivors , watched the newsreels for the first time , took an active part in the inquiry . <P> Five years ago the Akron was approaching the mooring mast at Camp Kearney near San Diego , Calif , when a sudden updraft tossed her 1,000 ft. aloft with three members of the ground crew dangling from a line . Two presently fell to their deaths ( TIME , May 23 , 1932 ) . With this spectacular incident in mind , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hindenburg 's ground crew at the crucial moment , thus missed the first flare of flame . The investigators last week appealed for any amateur film which might shed new light .
