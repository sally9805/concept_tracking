The house of Habsburg-Lorraine last fortnight sent a stalking horse back into the Austrian Republic which had banned all Habsburg-Lorraines who had not renounced their claims to the throne . A tall , white-chinned man of 71 with the Habsburg horse face , he stepped off the train from Switzerland at Vienna 's West Station and looked into the faces of a notable company : the Minister of War . Prince Alois von Schonburg-Hartenstein ( ' ' Our venerated and beloved Field Marshal ! " ) ; the son of Archduke Franz Ferdinand whose assassination detonated the War ; the heads of the great houses of Mens-dorff-Pouilly and Pallavicini ( " Imperial Highness ! " ) ; and the new arrival 's cousin , the Archduke Anton and his wife Princess Ileana of Rumania . For it was the best beloved of the archdukes , old Eugen Ferdinand Pius Bernard Felix Maria , grand master of the Teutonic Order , chevalier of the Orders of the Golden Fleece , the Black Eagle , the Seraphim , etc . And before his arrival in Vienna he had renounced nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephan 's Cathedral and heard mass , then walked to the palace of the Teutonic Order , then to another church to pray . When he saw troops of little girls in starched white dresses with paper flowers in their hair , it seemed a good omen . It was the first Thursday after Whitsunday , Vienna 's traditional day for confirmations . Said he : " I have returned as a private person and I am glad to be able to spend the eventide of my life in the Fatherland . " The Government announced that his reception in Vienna was thoroughly unofficial . <P> Last week it became more official to 100,000 Viennese on the pavements for the Corpus Christi parade . There marched Chancellor Dollfuss . Vice Chancellor Prince von Starhemberg . Minister of Public Security Emil Fey . And behind them came old Eugen. tall and deliberate , the ceremonial robes of a Grand Master of the Teutonic Order swinging about his calves . A shout eddied along beside him : " Eugen ! Eugen ! " The Habsburg knew Vienna liked him . <P> Pleased with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later called on Eugen at the Teutonic Order 's palace .
