SCENE : The dining-room of a cottage somewhere in the suburbs of a manufacturing town in eastern Ohio . The room is clean , neat , bare and sunny . It is seen in the morning of a spring day , not long ago . There is an inner door at the right ; another at the rear leads to the kitchen . At the left there are an outside door and an eastern window . The table is set for breakfast . HANUS , an elderly workman , comes in from the right wiping his face and ears with a towel . He stops short with the towel in his hands , looks at it , and tries to think what to do with it . HANUS WICKS Muttering to himself , as is his wontMust have picked this up somewhere . Always finding something in my hands , not knowing where I got it . He hangs the towel on the door-knob and goes to the window . Fine sunny day , they 'll say . Sure , I 'll say , fine sunny day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine sunny day and wish it would rain once in a while . " Wish it would rain , " you say . " Huh , " they say . " There goes Hanus , says he wishes it was going to rain .  --  He 's screwy , " they say . Why ca n't a man like rain ? Everybody else likes what he likes . He turns to the table . By the Jumping Jiminy Whosis she 's got that scrap-iron set out for breakfast again . I ca n't eat scrap-iron . Roughage , they call it . That 's a mild word for it , roughage . It 's got a cutting edge like a diamond drill . MARTHA , an elderly housewife , enters from the kitchen , carrying a pan. p. 3 MARTHA MINCH He 's not here yet ? HANUS WICKS No , ma'am . MARTHA MINCH The car goes in fifteen minutes . HANUS WICKS I know it does , ma'am . I 'll call him . He starts out . MARTHA MINCH Hanus ! HANUS WICKS Yes , ma'am . MARTHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HANUS WICKS I ? No , ma'am . MARTHA MINCH No ? HANUS WICKS Yes , ma'am , I think I did . MARTHA MINCH Have n't I told you ten thousand times to leave the towels in the bath-room ? HANUS WICKS I was n't sure where I got it . MARTHA MINCH You were n't sure  --  for God 's sake , Hanus , where would a person get a towel ? HANUS WICKS Yes , ma'am . He takes the towel and starts out . As he goes he mutters again . Anyway Steve was in the bath-room . That 's what happened . Steve must have been in the bath-room so I just could n't think what to do with the towel  --  p. 4 MARTHA MINCH Hanus ! HANUS WICKS Yes , ma'am . MARTHA MINCH Quit talking to yourself ! I ca n't stand it the way you talk to yourself ! You do it all the time . It drives people crazy . We 'll all be as crazy as you if you keep on . HANUS WICKS Do you think I 'm crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ? HANUS WICKS Yes , ma'am . He picks up the towel , looks at it , and starts nervously to put it in his pocket . Steve was in the bath-room , that 's it . MARTHA MINCH Going into the kitchenI give up . HANUS WICKS You should n't scare a man to death . A man ca n't  --  ca n't think when he 's scared . You get me so scared I do n't know what you say , and then you say you give up . G. Whosis , I gave up away back in 1915 . He takes out the towel and contemplates it . STEPHEN , a pleasant , gentle , submissive little man of more than fifty , enters . He is also carrying a towel . STEPHEN MINCH Good morning , Hanus . HANUS WICKS You better put that towel back in the bath-room. p. 5 STEPHEN MINCH Towel ? Oh , yes . He starts to hang it on the knob , then crams it into his pocket . No time . Sorry . He sits . Sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lap . MARTHA enters with toast . Do you mind if I do n't eat my bran this morning , Martha ? It 's twenty-five past . MARTHA MINCH Taking the towel from his pocket and the other from HANUS ' kneesEat anything you like , both of you . She goes out with the towels . STEPHEN MINCH This is not one of our best mornings , Hanus . HANUS WICKS No , Steve . We 're low this morning . We 're away down . STEPHEN MINCH Beautiful morning , birds in the trees , sun out , dandelions looking right back at him , but the wife 's under a cloud . HANUS WICKS I wish it would rain . STEPHEN MINCH There 's going to be a bad storm . I can feel it in my bones .  --  I guess I 'll go . I do n't want any breakfast . He starts to rise . MARTHA re-enters . Is something the matter , Martha ? p. 6 MARTHA MINCH If we must live in the same house with a complete half-wit you might at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his half-wit tricks ! You 're more like Hanus every day . STEPHEN MINCH What have I done ? What have I done now ? MARTHA MINCH Hanus ! Must you dunk your toast in your coffee ? HANUS drops his toast . STEPHEN MINCH And you 're wrong about Hanus ! He 's smarter than most people . I tell you I could n't get along without him in the laboratory . MARTHA MINCH Just the same I ca n't get along with him here . STEPHEN MINCH More than that , did n't he save my life ? MARTHA MINCH Yes , tell me all about that again . You 'll have just time before the street-car goes . Tell me about the picnic and how you fell in the water and hit your head on a rock and went down for the third time . And how all your life went before your eyes in a flash  --  only Hanus pulled you out , so you lived . Was n't that how it was ? HANUS WICKS It was n't anything . The water was just taking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the hair . That 's all it was . MARTHA MINCH Thirty-five years ago ? p. 7 HANUS WICKS Yes , ' m . He eats . On the Fourth of July . The same Fourth of July when you got engaged to Stephen . MARTHA MINCH It 's nice to know gratitude lasts so long . I ca n't think of any other emotion that hangs on that way .  --  He saved your life thirty-five years ago , so he still eats off you and cadges off you and has a bed in your house . If you cared half as much for me as for him you 'd have told him long since I could n't stand it and he 'd have to board somewhere else . HANUS WICKS I  --  I did n't know  --  STEPHEN MINCH He would n't have anywhere to go , Martha . Besides , you do n't know what Hanus does in the laboratory  --  MARTHA MINCH Oh , yes , I do .  --  STEPHEN MINCH No , you do n't . We work together , and he earns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get paid ? STEPHEN MINCH Because they do n't understand about him . When I 'm working at something I get stuck sometimes , and just do n't know what to try next . And Hanus works right along with me , not saying a word  --  MARTHA MINCH Oh , not saying a word ? p. 8 STEPHEN MINCH Well , just talking to himself , you know , the way he does . Only when I 'm really stuck , he 'll put his head into whatever I 'm supposed to be doing , and then he 'll say , " Why do n't you try this ? " And it 'll be some fool thing I never thought of , and probably no good , only it 'll make me think of something that is good , so then I 'll go ahead  --  and maybe figure it out . MARTHA MINCH Oh , that 's what Hanus does in the laboratory ? Why could n't you think of it for yourself ? STEPHEN MINCH I do n't know . Only I could n't . MARTHA MINCH You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . STEPHEN MINCH I do n't want any breakfast . HANUS WICKS I do n't want any , either . MARTHA MINCH Then you 'd better wipe the egg off your chin . STEPHEN MINCH MildlyMartha . MARTHA returns . MARTHA MINCH Look , Stephen  --  we 've been married thirty-five years  --  and every year of that thirty-five you 've told me you had to have Hanus with you to help with inventions . And every year I 've hoped and waited , hoped and waited , till my hope 's worn thin , and I 'm worn thin . Every year you invent something , and every year I think maybe it 's going to mean something to you and me . Maybe we 'll be able to have an apartment in town , and a servant , and I wo n't have to cook and wash and make my own garden . And every time an invention comes along what happens ? It belongs to the company . And do you get a raise in salary , so we could live a little better , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even go to a concert  --  ? No , the company makes the money , and you 're still in the laboratory at $27.50 a week , and a barnacle called Hanus star-boarding with us. p. 9 STEPHEN MINCH Martha . MARTHA MINCH Ca n't you get angry ? If you got angry with me just once it might mean there was some hope of your getting mad enough to stand up for your rights at the factory ! Twenty-seven fifty a week , a man of your ability , a man with your record ! You invented one of the first automobiles , and sold it , and it 's made so many millions they do n't know what to do with the money ! You invented a washing-machine that everybody else in the world can afford except me . You built a piano action , but I have n't any piano . The best-selling vacuum-cleaner in the world is the one you put together to clean Hanus up after the near-beer exploded ! I do n't know anything you have n't invented except a way to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes the credit away from you , and steals the patents  --  and nobody 's ever seen you angry  --  nobody 's ever heard you complain  --  or ask for a raise ! STEPHEN MINCH But I 'm working for the company , Martha . They pay for my services . MARTHA MINCH Do they ? How many times a millionaire is Mr. Charley Duffy ? And what did he ever do ? STEPHEN MINCH I guess I ca n't explain to you , Martha . MARTHA MINCH I do n't want you to explain it to me . I want something to happen . p. 10 STEPHEN MINCH Maybe I 'll get a raise . MARTHA MINCH You know you wo n't , though , because you 'll never have the gumption to ask for it . STEPHEN MINCH No , I  --  I guess not . HANUS WICKS We 've got to go , Stephen . STEPHEN MINCH I 'm sorry , Martha . MARTHA MINCH It does n't matter . It 's too late to do anything about it now . STEPHEN MINCH Are n't we still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we ? Being in love does n't last forever on $27.50 a week . STEPHEN MINCH I thought we were . MARTHA MINCH You have n't thought about it . You have n't thought about me for so many years I ca n't believe it ever happened . You think about inventions , and Hanus , and the company , and the rights of man , and the war in Spain , but not about me . You should have married someone else . STEPHEN MINCH It 's not much good saying things like that . MARTHA MINCH No , but I mean it . You might have been somebody if it had n't been for me . And I might have been somebody , too . STEPHEN MINCH You ca n't say you 've kept me back , Martha . p. 11 MARTHA MINCH Oh , yes . You sold the car engine patent so we could get married , and then you took a job in the factory , and we 've never had any money since . You should have married Hallie . STEPHEN MINCH Hallie who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN MINCH I ca n't remember her much . That was away back . MARTHA MINCH Well , I remember . You should have married her and I should have married  --  someone else . STEPHEN MINCH Who ? HANUS WICKS We have to go , Stephen . STEPHEN MINCH Who ? HANUS WICKS We 'll be late to the factory . STEPHEN MINCH You mean the banker boy  --  the one with the long neck ? MARTHA MINCH He 's in New York now . He owns a whole steel company . You should have married her and I should have married him . We 'd both be rich now . STEPHEN MINCH I wish I knew what to do , Martha . MARTHA MINCH Go to work . STEPHEN MINCH There 's something I meant to tell you this morning . I 've been working on something , sort of on the side , that  --  that  --  oh , they 'll have to give me a raise if I finish this one , wo n't they , Hanus ? And I 'll be somebody . p. 12 HANUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTHA MINCH Another invention ? STEPHEN MINCH That 's it . MARTHA MINCH On company time ? STEPHEN MINCH In a way  --  MARTHA MINCH Then the company will own the earth , not you . STEPHEN MINCH But you do n't know what this one is ; Martha , it takes your breath away . It  --  it 's so incredible I do n't dare talk about it . You know how it makes me feel ? As if I 'd written a poem , a great  --  sort of poem  --  all in symbols and lines of light  --  HANUS WICKS Like Berton Braley  --  STEPHEN MINCH Only much better  --  as if I 'd happened on the  --  the equation they 're all looking for  --  by accident , sort of  --  because I never would have dared to look for it  --  only it 's there  --  and I found it  --  MARTHA MINCH No doubt they 'll make a lot of money out of it  --  STEPHEN MINCH And there 's another thing I think  --  Martha . It 's that  --  just working at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . Sometimes I think they can have the money  --  because I have the best part .  --  They can have all the money , if they 'll let me work there at things and find them .  --  That 's the best part  --  it 's so good if they knew I had it they 'd take it away from me. p. 13 MARTHA MINCH You 'd better tell your employers . Maybe you 're holding out on them . STEPHEN MINCH I am . I 'm holding out the best thing in the world .  --  Do you see what I mean , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH No . I 'm an old woman and I 've never had anything . And now I 'll never have anything . If people are crazy enough , like you two , they can imagine they have something , but I 'm not crazy enough . I 've never had a car , I 've never had a house , I 've never had pretty clothes , nothing but the satisfaction of doing my own work  --  and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piano we could n't keep up the payments and they took it away . STEPHEN MINCH You wish you 'd married that tenor with the high collar ? MARTHA MINCH Yes , I do . For both of us.  --  Look  --  here we are  --  old people  --  and what have we had ? STEPHEN MINCH Just each other . Because we were in love . MARTHA MINCH Yes . People fall in love when they 're young , and they think that 's all there is , and they 'll never want anything else . But that wears out after a while  --  the living on nothing and worshipping each other  --  that wears out . And then the rest 's work . Maybe it 's fun for you . A street-car passes with the bell clanging. p. 14 HANUS WICKS That was our car . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , I know . HANUS WICKS We 'll be late now . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , we 'll be late .  --  I wish you could see it , Martha . MARTHA MINCH I wish I could . STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out . CURTAIN p. 15 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONE : SCENE II SCENE : A room in the laboratory wing of the Arlington-Duffy factories . It is practically unfurnished except for a number of stools along the bench and sink that line the right wall , under-neath shelves and cabinets . There is a door in the right wall down stage from the bench . In the rear there are two windows , and on the sill of one of them a small letter file . At the left stands a peculiar apparatus , looking much like a time safe , only taller , narrower , having many dials on its face , a rail or handle on each side , and a silver dome on top . It is set on high casters , so that a mechanic may crawl under it to make adjustments . A clock on the rear wall points to 9:30 . Old ANGELA , a scrub-woman with a dark , brooding face , is finishing the floor under the windows . PARK and RIPPLE , two young chemists , enter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . You can take a look at it . RIPPLE Funniest looking contraption I ever saw . What are these ? PARK Pretty hard to say , since he does n't put any marks or numbers on ' em . RIPPLE Looks like a safe . PARK That 's my guess , too . RIPPLE How long 's he been working on it ? p. 16 PARK Quite a while . RIPPLE On the company 's time . PARK Sure . Uses company materials , too . RIPPLE They do n't give me that much leeway . PARK They do n't give anybody that much leeway . He 's been here a long time , of course . RIPPLE They say he knows more about rubber than anybody in the business . PARK Maybe he does . He 's worked on it plenty . He 's supposed to be working on it now . RIPPLE Turning out that new tire ? PARK Yeah . RIPPLE I hear that 's good . PARK Oh , he knows his stuff . Never had any education ; one of these so-called intuitive guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time than anything else in research . PARK Sure it does . Only what are you going to do ? Once in a while they hit on something . Just often enough to keep going . To ANGELAAre n't you pretty late in here ? ANGELA I always do this one last . He never complains . Not a word . Not a word . Everybody else complains . Him , not a word . p. 17 PARK I see . RIPPLE At the benchWhat 's he doing with the rubber ? PARK Just trying it out . You know , same old business , trial and error . RIPPLE They can take all these trial and error guys and use ' em to putty the windows . PARK That 's what I say . APFEL , a bustling executive , enters . APFEL Steve 's wanted in the office , boys . Will you tell him ? PARK Steve ? He 's not here yet . APFEL Not here ! Cripes , the old man 's just about ready to detonate now . He 'll take the roof off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PARK I do n't know . Just did n't come in . APFEL The old man came down early to see him , and came in boiling , too . When he hears this it 'll affect the seismographs in Tokio . Send Steve over when he comes in , will you ? PARK Sure . How about Hanus ? APFEL No , thanks . We do n't need Hanus . APFEL goes out . PARK Well , well . p. 18 RIPPLE Wrong day to be late , evidently . PARK Yeah . He walks over to the machine . How long 's Steve been working at this thing , Angela ? ANGELA That ? I do n't know , sir . PARK You must know how long it 's been here . ANGELA Maybe four or five years . PARK You do n't know what it is ? ANGELA No , sir .  --  Yes , sir  --  he said it was a safe . He said he was making himself a safe . CHARLES DUFFY OutsideWhat do you mean he 's not here ? Good God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning the employees can get here at nine in the morning , and you 'll see they do ! APFEL OutsideYes , sir . CHARLES DUFFY Opening the door I gave up my golf to get here at nine , and the God-damn staff wanders in when they God-damn please ! One of the penalties of responsibility , no doubt  --  well , by the Almighty , I 'll see to a few penalties for other people around here ! Park ! APFEL follows DUFFY in. p. 19 PARK Yes , sir . CHARLES DUFFY What in hell 's the matter with Steve Minch ? PARK I do n't know , sir . CHARLES DUFFY Well find out , somebody , find out and get him here ! Is this company run for the convenience of a lot of God-damn communistic employees or are we in business by any chance ? Who are you ? RIPPLE My name 's Ripple , sir . CHARLES DUFFY New man , huh ? Well , dig in , dig into that carbon idea , and maybe you 'll get somewhere . What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . Looks like a safe . CHARLES DUFFY Looks like a safe ? Do n't you get reports ? Do n't you know what it is ? APFEL No , sir . Steve does n't always make reports . CHARLES DUFFY I thought he was working on that rubber analysis ! APFEL He is . He 's supposed to be . CHARLES DUFFY Well , is n't he ? APFEL Well , yes , he is , but he seems to put some time on that thing , too . CHARLES DUFFY I 've had enough . I 've had enough right now . Who else knows about rubber around here ? p. 20 APFEL Ripple 's studied it , of course . PARK I specialized in it over at the Brook plant . CHARLES DUFFY Have you followed this stuff Steve 's been doing ? PARK In a general way , yes . CHARLES DUFFY Could you handle his work , that 's what I want to know ? And mind you , I want quick results ! PARK I think I could . I 'm certain I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUFFY Then you 'll get a chance . By God , you 'll get a chance ! Tell Minch to report to me when he comes in ! He goes out , slamming the door so hard that a pane falls out and breaks on the floor . APFEL Hell and high water . He goes to the door , looks out through the broken pane , salutes the two chemists and goes out gently . RIPPLE Boy , I know about as much about rubber  --  as you do . PARK I know enough . RIPPLE Why do you want me in on it ? PARK Just for fun . RIPPLE You want to get us both fired ? p. 21 PARK Listen . Steve has all the possible formulae for rubber worked out and put away in a card index . I 've seen them . RIPPLE What good does that do us ? PARK They 're in that letter-file over there . RIPPLE He 'll take them with him if he goes . PARK They belong to the company . RIPPLE He 'd leave ' em here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PARK He is . It 's painful . RIPPLE Jeez . It 's criminal . PARK Well , there it is . STEPHEN and HANUS come in . STEPHEN MINCH ' Morning , boys . PARK ' Morning , Stephen . RIPPLE ' Morning . PARK We were supposed to tell you the boss wants to see you at once , Steve . STEPHEN MINCH Thanks . I 'll go right over . Apfel told me . We 'll put a couple of tubes on to boil and go right over . Late as the devil this morning . HANUS WICKS RushingLet me at these , will you ? PARK and RIPPLE move away from the bench. p. 22 PARK I guess a fellow like you can afford to be late . STEPHEN MINCH Why ? PARK Oh , you 're needed around here . You 've got a lot under your hat . STEPHEN MINCH Does n't make a damn bit of difference . I 've seen too many boys come out of college and go right up to the top , over my head . I 've seen seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as goats , going up over my head like sparks on the wind . You 'll do it yourselves . He fits a tube to a tester . PARK Oh , no . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , yes . They all do . PARK Well , I guess you 're pretty busy . We 'll blow . STEPHEN MINCH O.K. boys . Thanks . PARK and RIPPLE go out . Set ? HANUS WICKS Who 's been messing with my stuff ? I laid a tube down here , and it 's been moved ! STEPHEN MINCH Angela ? ANGELA I never touch the bench . Mr. Park was looking at it . HANUS WICKS I knew he was , the college snoop . He talks while they work . Barging in here with their arms full of diplomas , trying to last long enough so they can date all the stenographers in the outer office . No more brain than a lightning-rod. p. 23 STEPHEN MINCH You can work faster if you talk less . HANUS WICKS Pawing over the test-tubes , looking at our ma- chine.  --  It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beaker in his hand . STEPHEN MINCH You know what I think , Hanus ? HANUS WICKS No . STEPHEN MINCH I think maybe there 's something we 'd rather do than talk to the old man this morning . You know what it is ? HANUS WICKS We better not . STEPHEN MINCH We ought to see him now ? HANUS WICKS You 're damn right we ought to see him now . STEPHEN MINCH You know what I think ? In ten minutes we 'd have it done . Charley can wait . HANUS WICKS Done so it works ? STEPHEN MINCH Done so it works . He caresses the machine lovingly . And then what 's he going to say ? HANUS WICKS We better not . STEPHEN MINCH Watch the dials a minute . He crawls under the machine. p. 24 HANUS WICKS I do n't want to have to go home and say we got fired  --  STEPHEN MINCH Under the machineWhat do you get now ? HANUS WICKS Sixteen hundred . STEPHEN MINCH A.D. ? HANUS WICKS That 's right . STEPHEN MINCH Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HANUS WICKS April . STEPHEN MINCH Hour ? HANUS WICKS Seven P.M. STEPHEN MINCH It 's a little off somewhere . Reach in and turn the set-screw one notch . HANUS tips the silver dome and reaches inside . The other way . That 's it . That 's enough . HANUS WICKS Why did you build this thing , Steve ? STEPHEN MINCH Why ? HANUS WICKS Yeah , why ? STEPHEN MINCH Because I  --  sort of happened on it  --  and it was a great idea . HANUS WICKS You were n't thinking of using it ? p. 25 STEPHEN MINCH We might try it out . HANUS WICKS I would n't want to get stuck  --  somewhere away back . HANUS replaces the dome . STEPHEN MINCH Keep your mind on your work . Now what do you get ? HANUS WICKS December fifteenth , 1878 . ANGELA Does it tell fortunes ? STEPHEN MINCH Why ? ANGELA That 's my birthday . She goes toward the door . HANUS WICKS ScornfullyDoes it tell fortunes . ANGELA I can tell your fortune , Mr. Hanus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be fired today . HANUS WICKS Do n't say that . Do n't say it ! ANGELA You 're going to be fired , and Park and Ripple are going to take over the rubber . They 've got it worked out to use the figures in your file there . STEPHEN MINCH What 's that ? He gets out from under. p. 26 ANGELA So that 's your fortune . You better do something quick . STEPHEN MINCH How do you know ? ANGELA They were in here talking about it . She goes out . HANUS WICKS I knew it  --  the college graduates ! The dumb B.A. 's . STEPHEN MINCH We 'll go see Charley , Hanus . I 'll tell him about this machine . Maybe that 'll fix it up . The door opens and DUFFY enters with APFEL . STEPHEN is still on the floor . HANUS finds the beaker in his pocket , where he thrust it to work on the machine , pulls it out , drops it , saves it with his toe , and retrieves it , embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry to interrupt you , I 'm sure . Buried in work this morning , are n't you ? STEPHEN MINCH We were just  --  CHARLES DUFFY Did you get my message ? STEPHEN MINCH We were just coming . HANUS WICKS Yeah , we were just coming . CHARLES DUFFY Oh , were you ? Well , that 's a concession . A couple of giant intellects like yours taking time off to communicate with the president of the company . I should n't have expected it . No , no , let me come to you . Do n't let me take you from your work . HANUS finds a towel in his pocket and surreptitiously thrusts it back again . Who the hell do you think you are ? p. 27 STEPHEN MINCH We  --  we were late this morning . CHARLES DUFFY That explains everything . You were late this morning . Well , I was n't late . I came in early to see you . I came in early because that tire you turned out for the spring models will have to be redesigned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN MINCH I see . Well , that can be done  --  CHARLES DUFFY Oh , it can ? Dies , molds , presses , formulae  --  the whole damn set-up to be readjusted , and ten thousand sample tires scrapped  --  all in a week . That 's easy  --  and who got us into the jam ? Who gave us the formula for that tire ? STEPHEN MINCH Was there something wrong with it ? CHARLES DUFFY Wrong with it ? We ca n't wear it out , you dumb cluck ! We 've worn out two cars on one set of those tires ! They 've gone a hundred and thirty thousand miles on the proving track , and we ca n't wear the tread off on the rear wheels ! STEPHEN MINCH But  --  you asked me to increase the mileage . CHARLES DUFFY I asked you to increase the mileage by about five thousand miles ! I asked you for a twenty-two thousand mile tire ! I did n't ask you for a hundred and thirty thousand mile tire ! Do you want to wreck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 STEPHEN MINCH I should think the better the tire was  --  the more miles you could get  --  would be fine  --  CHARLES DUFFY Now look , Stephen  --  you 're not as stupid as you let on . I 've known you forty years  --  and you know as well as I do the profit in the tire business comes from replacements . If we equip our car with tires that wo n't wear out we stand to lose seven millions a year ! What 's more we 're pledged to the Rubber Association not to make a tire that 'll do better than thirty thousand miles ! You knew that , and you slipped over a formula that 'd wreck our business and get us in Dutch with all our competitors ! It 'll never wear out  --  never ! They 've been going crazy with it out on the proving ground , and I 've been going crazy in the office ! Because the squawk comes back to me ! And you knew it would ! STEPHEN MINCH No , sir . No , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUFFY Did n't understand what ? STEPHEN MINCH I thought you wanted as good a tire as I could make  --  CHARLES DUFFY But I told you , did n't I ? STEPHEN MINCH I guess I did n't believe you . It did n't look quite honest to me , not to make it as good as we could make it . p. 29 CHARLES DUFFY Well , now you know , do n't you  --  ? Now you understand ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir . CHARLES DUFFY When can I have the formula for a twenty-two thousand mile tire ? STEPHEN MINCH Tomorrow . APFEL I thought I told you to work out a whole series , from fifteen thousand miles to fifty . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir . I have n't got it all yet . Not the low mileage ones . CHARLES DUFFY Why not ? You 've had time enough ! STEPHEN MINCH I  --  I 've been doing something else . CHARLES DUFFY What ? Something more important , no doubt ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir , much more important . CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweetheart , son-of-a-bitch , what a sweetheart  --  CHARLES DUFFY What are you saying  --  HANUS WICKS I was n't saying anything  --  son-of-a-bitch of a sweetheart  --  CHARLES DUFFY Who lets that crank in here ? Apfel , is he on the payroll ? p. 30 APFEL No , sir . HANUS WICKS I 'll be a son-of-a CHARLES DUFFY They 're both fired ! Go get his check for him  --  and never mind about tomorrow . We 'll get along  --  APFEL goes out . STEPHEN MINCH But about this machine , Mr. Duffy  --  if you knew what it was  --  CHARLES DUFFY I do n't care what it is ! STEPHEN MINCH You will , though . You will when you hear about it . CHARLES DUFFY All right  --  what is it ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's something nobody would believe . It 's like the radio was when it first came out  --  you could n't believe it . It 's like the airplane was  --  the papers would n't even report it because they thought it could n't be true . CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN MINCH I ca n't even tell you the principle of it , because I do n't really know what it is . I just know it acts the way it does . It 's like radio that way  --  nobody knows why the waves work the way they do ; they just know how they work . Marconi did n't know why the wireless worked . He said he did n't . But it worked just the same . This is a machine that picks up waves , too  --  only it picks them up anywhere  --  a year ago or two years ago  --  p. 31 CHARLES DUFFY You mean it picks up old programs ? That 's not much good . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , no , it picks up anything , anywhere . The kind of thing we used to think was a miracle . CHARLES DUFFY Can you give it a name ? STEPHEN MINCH We call it the  --  Star-Wagon . DUFFY steps back a little . You do n't really ride in it . We just call it that . CHARLES DUFFY That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interesting  --  He begins to edge toward the door . STEPHEN MINCH You see , they always thought time was a sort of string with beads on it , as if we were all beads on a string , but it 's not that way at all  --  CHARLES DUFFY No , I can see that  --  Jesus  --  beads on a string  --  STEPHEN MINCH It 's more like a moving platform , but you can get on it anywhere , and off it anywhere  --  it 's hard to explain  --  you do n't have to be in one place or time  --  you can change it  --  CHARLES DUFFY Yeah ? Write it down  --  make a report . He turns and finds HANUS between him and the door , which is closed . You hear , Hanus , have him make a report  --  p. 32 STEPHEN MINCH Some people understand it better if you say time is like the banks of a canal , and we 're canal boats moving between the banks .  --  Now the banks are always there  --  they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a way of making our boats go back and forth in the canal  --  HANUS WICKS With this you just press a button , and there you are . CHARLES DUFFY Why you poor fish  --  I always knew you were crazy , but I thought you were harmless . What 's that door shut for ? HANUS WICKS So they wo n't listen out there . He turns the key in the lock . CHARLES DUFFY He mutters . Give me that key ! Canal boats ! Canal boats ! HANUS puts the key in his mouth and begins to search his pockets in confusion . STEPHEN MINCH First you set it for place and time , then you press the button and keep hold of the railing on the side . Then you do n't move and the machine does n't move , but everything else moves . Time and place . It all goes past you like a shot and leaves you where you want to be . CHARLES DUFFY Damn it .  --  Where do you think I want to be ? p. 33 STEPHEN MINCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in my own office  --  STEPHEN MINCH When ? CHARLES DUFFY When ? Why half an hour ago , you lunatic  --  or last year , if it suits you better ! STEPHEN MINCH I 'll make it last year . He sets the dials . CHARLES DUFFY Give me that key ! He snatches the key from HANUS ' mouth . Move ! He opens the door and steps into the doorway . As I said before , you 're fired , and before you go home you 'd better have your head examined ! STEPHEN MINCH I assure you you 're making a mistake  --  CHARLES DUFFY And before you get your last check you 'll turn in your rubber analyses . They belong to the company . Apfel ! APFEL OutsideYes , sir . He enters . CHARLES DUFFY Have that nut-machine scrapped for the materials . God knows what they 've poured into it . APFEL They requisitioned thirteen pints of mercury and three pounds of platinum wire . p. 34 CHARLES DUFFY That 's five thousand dollars tied up in the mess . Rip it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it scrapped tomorrow . HANUS WICKS Striding up to him I 'll rip your  --  yes , by God , I 'll rip your  --  CHARLES DUFFY What ? HANUS WICKS CollapsingYou must n't do this , Mr. Duffy . CHARLES DUFFY Why ? STEPHEN MINCH Do n't you see we 've happened on the one thing everybody 's looking for , Charley  --  ? CHARLES DUFFY Do n't Charley me  --  STEPHEN MINCH GulpingMr . Duffy  --  the one thing they 've all said we 'd find .  --  Up to now it 's all been theory about the fourth dimension .  --  Everybody said it was there  --  the mathematicians said it was there  --  the physicists said it was there , only when they quit writing their books they went right back into Euclid again , and they could n't find any way out . But Euclid 's nothing but an illusion , honest he is  --  you can walk right through him . There are n't any right angles in space , and there are n't any straight lines  --  and there 's nothing positive about time or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time  --  and matter is n't solid  --  materials are n't any more solid than a wave of light from the sun  --  . I 've got it all set down here , but it 's in symbols  --  He stops in despair. p. 35 CHARLES DUFFY Treat ' em gently , Apfel . They 're raving  --  ! Raving mad ! APFEL Yes , sir . DUFFY disappears . STEPHEN MINCH Mr. Apfel , I do n't know how to put things in words  --  I 've never had to use words  --  but do n't take it apart  --  I 'd never have the heart to build another  --  and I 'll pay for it when I can  --  and it 's a thing that 's never been in the world before  --  it 's a key to all the great things men are trying to say in all the laboratories there are  --  it 's the alchemists ' secret  --  there 's nothing to it but a series of mathematical relations  --  but when you know them they build up into the mystery of how things happen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like a chord  --  in music  --  He stops again , looking at APFEL 'S face . APFEL Here 's your check . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir . APFEL ushers them out . HANUS WICKS Sweetheart  --  CURTAIN p. 36 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT ONE : SCENE III SCENE : The laboratory after midnight , in complete darkness except for a flash light which someone is manipulating outside the window . The place is seen in glimpses , then the window opens to the pressure of a jimmy and STEPHEN puts his head inside , shouldering up the frame . He crawls in , HANUS following him . They turn on a light . HANUS WICKS Is the machine all right ? STEPHEN MINCH I 'll look it over . You open the outside door for ' em . HANUS WICKS Listen , Steve . Those fellows are n't mechanics . They 're burglars . STEPHEN MINCH Well , let ' em in . HANUS WICKS In here ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes , in here . HANUS WICKS Are you going to steal the wagon , Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha we were fired and the company smashed my invention . I 'm going to take it away before they bust it up . HANUS WICKS Well , I 'll let ' em in , but they look too professional to suit me . HANUS goes out . STEPHEN examines the machine carefully . HANUS re-enters with two evil-looking THUGS. p. 37 1ST THUG When does the watchman come round again ? STEPHEN MINCH Not till half past one . 1ST THUG Only got an hour . STEPHEN MINCH Sometimes he 's late . 2ND THUG Sometimes . STEPHEN MINCH Now if you gentlemen will let me explain  --  this probably is n't the kind of work you 're used to  --  1ST THUG What do you mean it 's not the kind we 're used to  --  ? STEPHEN MINCH I  --  I beg your pardon  --  I 'm afraid I assumed that  --  I took it for granted  --  1ST THUG Well , you watch yourself , what you take for granted , see ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir . 1ST THUG Well  --  get rolling . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THUG How do we move it ? STEPHEN MINCH Has to go out the window . 1ST THUG Looking outOut there ? STEPHEN MINCH Only about seven feet to the ground . p. 38 1ST THUG We could drop it out . STEPHEN MINCH Good God , no ! 1ST THUG Why not ? You ca n't hurt a safe , can you ? STEPHEN MINCH There 's things in it that would break . 1ST THUG What ? STEPHEN MINCH And it 'd make more noise than a fire-alarm , falling in the court . HANUS WICKS Did the company wreck it ? STEPHEN MINCH No . It 's just the way we left it . 1ST THUG Now listen , baby , what do you want us to do ? And make it fast . STEPHEN MINCH We 'll have to slide it out the window . I thought we could use planks . 1ST THUG I do n't see any planks . HANUS WICKS There 's a truck gangway in the basement . 1ST THUG Let 's see it . STEPHEN MINCH That 's it . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes toward the door. 1ST THUG You two fetch it . We had our exercise for today . STEPHEN and HANUS pause , looking uncertainly at the THUGS. p. 39 STEPHEN MINCH All right , fine . We 'll  --  we 'll fetch it . HANUS WICKS Oh , we do the work , huh ? And the ugly mugs get paid to sit around on their cans . I do n't like those two ; I do n't like anything about ' em . 1ST THUG What 's that you said ? HANUS WICKS Me ? Nothing .  --  Couple of WPA workers , that 's what they are . STEPHEN and HANUS go out. 1ST THUG Let ' em work . If they think I 'm going to bust a gut hoisting a safe out the window they 're cuckoo . 2ND THUG I do n't like this job . 1ST THUG The only thing to do with a safe is open it or blow it . 2ND THUG Want to beat it ? 1ST THUG Do n't go into a panic . I 'm here because I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is this guy ? 1ST THUG All I know is he come up to me in the skoff-house and says , " Want a little job ? " and I says , " Money in it ? " and he says , " I 'll give you twenty bucks . It 's all I got . " " Give it to me now , " I says . " Oh , no , " he says , " I 'll give it to you when it 's done . " " Tough , " I says . " What is this blankety-blank job ? " thinking he was a parson . " I want to move a safe , " he says , " and it 'll take anyway two men . " " I got a friend , " I got a friend , " I says , think-of you , see ? p. 40 2ND THUG Yeah . 1ST THUG So I says how far 's this safe being moved and he says out a window . So here we are and there 's the safe and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do n't move any safe out any window . I got other ideas . 2ND THUG I get you . 1ST THUG Sure . The door opens and STEPHEN and HANUS enter , breathing heavily as they lug in the truck gangway . They set the thing down to get their breath . STEPHEN MINCH Think that 'll do it ? 1ST THUG Sure . That 's fine . STEPHEN MINCH Want to help run it out the window ? 1ST THUG No . You two do that part of it . I go a weak heart . STEPHEN and HANUS pause again , looking at the THUGS , then shove the window up farther and proceed to slide the gangway out to the court below . The THUGS calmly investigate the contents of the shelves and cabinets , helping themselves to a few odds and ends . Hanus . While he worksWe would n't want you to spoil your hands doing rough work , of course . A crook has to keep his fingers delicate so he can feel the tumblers dropping in a lock . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 41 STEPHEN MINCH We 'll get along faster if you do n't talk so much . 1ST THUG I certainly like to watch a couple of good men work . It does me good just to see it . STEPHEN and HANUS finish , and sink down , wiping their brows . That 's just about the whole job . What 's this ? He opens the letter file and takes out the cards . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , those are n't mine ! 1ST THUG What are they ? STEPHEN MINCH Rubber formulae all worked out for the company . Do n't  --  do n't mix them up  --  they 're  --  1ST THUG What ? STEPHEN MINCH Well , they 're very valuable , and they 're all in order . 1ST THUG Putting them in his pocketWell , now they 're mine , see , very valuable and all in order . STEPHEN and HANUS again stand looking at the THUGS . What 's the matter ? STEPHEN MINCH You ca n't do that . 1ST THUG I guess I can . Do n't mind about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . He continues to paw things over. p. 42 STEPHEN MINCH But  --  1ST THUG I say go right on with your work ! STEPHEN MINCH I do n't know how we 're going to get it up to the window . 1ST THUG I do n't either . You 're both pretty light . He lights a cigarette . HANUS WICKS Boy Scouts . The THUGS make no move to help , and STEVE and HANUS try to adjust the gangway . It falls with a crash and the THUGS jump to their feet. 1ST THUG What are you trying to do ? STEPHEN MINCH It fell . The gangway fell . 1ST THUG You let it fall . 2ND THUG There 's somebody coming . Footsteps are heard. 1ST THUG Say the right thing , brother . The door opens and MISTY , the watchman , enters tentatively . MISTY Is everything all right here ? 1ST THUG Sure , everything 's all right . MISTY I do n't know you . 1ST THUG What the hell ! He thinks we 're robbing the laboratory ! Speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , Misty . MISTY You did n't put your name down , Mr. Minch . You did n't put your name down when you come in . STEPHEN MINCH I forgot it . MISTY Now look . You fellows are always doing something like that . How was I to know it was n't burglars in here ? 1ST THUG Yeah , how was he to know ? You might have got me in trouble , too , see ? MISTY So you put your names in the book after this . He goes out. 1ST THUG Jesus , are you all like that here ? STEPHEN MINCH You better give us a hand with this now . 1ST THUG You 're certainly amateurs , are n't you ? STEPHEN MINCH Amateurs ? 1ST THUG At safe-cracking ? STEPHEN MINCH We 're not cracking any safe . 1ST THUG Looks like a damn funny business to me . HANUS WICKS What 's funny about it ? 1ST THUG If you 're moving a safe , you do it by daylight . If you 're cracking it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always . 1ST THUG Absolutely .  --  What 's in it ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's my own . 1ST THUG How about going shares ? STEPHEN MINCH Shares ? On what ? 1ST THUG On what 's in it . STEPHEN MINCH But there 's nothing  --  there 's nothing you 'd want . 1ST THUG I 'll know better after I see it . STEPHEN MINCH After a pauseWe 'd better see if we can get it up to the window . 1ST THUG O.K. STEPHEN MINCH We 'll all have to help . 1ST THUG I do n't get the philosophy of this , boys . We got a safe here with something in it we want . We hoist it out the window and run it into the court . What 's the sense of it ? You can open it here and save yourself all that exertion . STEPHEN MINCH I 'm not going to open it ! 1ST THUG Are you taking it home for a keep-sake ? Do n't you know if you start wheeling that box through the streets you 'll be stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 45 STEPHEN MINCH But you see , really , I 'm just paying you to help me . I did n't ask you to tell me what to do . 1ST THUG Only I 'm telling you . I 'm telling you now . Give me the twenty bucks . STEPHEN MINCH It is n't yours yet . 1ST THUG Taking out a gunTake it from him , Cully . The 2nd THUG goes to STEPHEN . This is in case we get hungry tomorrow . STEPHEN MINCH It 's in the bill-fold . The 2nd THUG extracts it. 1ST THUG Now we 're going to help you . And you 're going to do just as I say . Go over there and manipulate them dials . STEPHEN MINCH I can't. 1ST THUG Why not ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's  --  it 's a time-set. 1ST THUG Then  --  just to be helpful  --  we 'll blow it . STEPHEN MINCH Blow it ! You mean  --  smash it open ? 1ST THUG This is soup , professor . It takes the lid off anything . STEPHEN MINCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THUG Not if you open it up  --  no . STEPHEN MINCH It ca n't  --  it ca n't be done  --  1ST THUG Then we drill it for soup . STEPHEN MINCH Well , I say you wo n't ! 1ST THUG Oh , you say I wo n't ! Well , your woman 's going to have a lot of patching to do if I start taking you apart . HANUS makes up his mind and rushes the Ist THUG , who calmly knocks him down . Want any more ? HANUS WICKS From the floorYou keep your hands off him or I 'll murder you ! 1ST THUG Shut up ! Come on , Cully , this one gets the same . STEPHEN MINCH Listen , Mr.  --  I do n't know your name  --  1ST THUG Never mind my name  --  STEPHEN MINCH I just want to tell you  --  I work here , you see  --  I 'm an inventor  --  and this is something I made  --  something extra that 's my own  --  only now the company says it belongs to them and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  because they 're taking it from me to smash it , and I 've worked all these years , and it 's the best thing I ever hit on  --  it 's better than anybody knows  --  better than you know .  --  If I could only tell you  --  p. 47 1ST THUG The longer you stand there the harder you hit the floor , see ? STEPHEN MINCH You must have wanted something , back before you  --  got this way  --  and it seemed as if you could n't go on if you did n't get it  --  1ST THUG You 're certainly asking for something , bo ! And you wo n't go far after you get it . STEPHEN MINCH And when I asked you to come here it was because I was desperate , do n't you see ? I did n't care if they shot me for it , I had to try to save this thing I made  --  even if I was to die for it  --  1ST THUG Are you talking about that safe ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  I 'll fight for it  --  2ND THUG Ah , let him have his little machine  --  1ST THUG Now what 's the matter with you  --  ? 2ND THUG Come on ; we got the twenty dollars  --  let 's get out of here  --  1ST THUG Now you 're belly-aching ! For Christ 's sake , what do you think he 's putting up the song and dance for if there 's nothing in it ? I 'll play fair with you , professor . I 'll give you half . You trust me. p. 48 STEPHEN MINCH You got your twenty dollars , and you did n't do anything for it , now you get the hell out ! 2ND THUG He 's crying , big boy , why do n't you let him have his machine ? 1ST THUG I 'll make hash out of all three of you , you bunch of mushheads ! Get out of the way before I fracture your dome ! He shoves STEPHEN aside and goes to the machine . Where in hell 's the lid of this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll make one . We have n't got much time , and it 's going to make a noise , but we 're going to see the inside of it if I have to shoot the watchman . He takes out a hand drill . HANUS WICKS You better do something with it , Steve . 1ST THUG That 's the idea , baby . The quickest way 's to open it . HANUS WICKS You better push the button , Steve . 1ST THUG What button ? HANUS WICKS It 's something you have to do with the machine . STEPHEN MINCH It 's out of sync , Hanus . I never had time to true it up . I do n't think it 'll work . p. 49 1ST THUG Well , if it do n't work you do n't lose anything . STEPHEN MINCH No , there 's nothing to lose now . And maybe a lot to gain . I 'll try it . He goes to the machine . The THUGS stand back . You 're going to smash it if I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll say I am . STEPHEN MINCH All right . You help me , Hanus . Slide under a minute , will you ? HANUS gets underneath the machine . HANUS WICKS What do you want ? STEPHEN MINCH One . HANUS WICKS Yeah . STEPHEN MINCH Nine . HANUS WICKS Yeah . STEPHEN MINCH 0 . HANUS WICKS Yeah . STEPHEN MINCH Two . HANUS WICKS Check . STEPHEN MINCH July 4th . HANUS WICKS Yeah . STEPHEN MINCH Nine A.M. HANUS WICKS Right . STEPHEN MINCH The bicycle shop . It 's on the map at the left . p. 50 HANUS WICKS The bicycle shop ? On the Fourth of July ? Look , Stephen , you 've got the whole world to pick from , and you pick a Fourth of July in a bicycle shop . STEPHEN MINCH That 's the Fourth where everything happened , Hanus  --  when you saved my life , and Martha and I fixed it up together . HANUS WICKS I see . 1ST THUG What kind of a funny business is this  --  ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's a time-set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It better work . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , it 'll work . Maybe it wo n't work the way it should , but it 'll work . HANUS WICKS O.K. I got it . The bicycle shop . July fourth . 1ST THUG If that 's a combination , I 'm a Vassar girl . STEPHEN MINCH It 's all right . Just give me a minute . Let me check the platinum a minute . He tips the dome , looks inside , and puts it back . Grab the other handle now , and help me swing it . HANUS climbs out and takes the handle opposite STEPHEN . I do n't know what 's going to happen , so hang on everybody ! He looks up at the clock . One o'clock . Here goes . He pushes the button . The lights dim sharply , there is the noise of an electric motor and the Two THUGS go backward out of the room , through the door that opens of itself . The lights go out entirely . There is a crash outside , and a terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eastern Ohio in the year 1902 . The place is a large one-room shell , formerly a blacksmith shop , with a window at the rear , large doors to the right and small door at the left . A few bicycles are ranked at the left rear . At right rear a repair bench is set against the wall under the window . At the extreme right stands a horseless carriage , with an engine under the seat . Tires are hung on a stanchion over-head , and a few accessories of the period are piled on shelves above the bench . There is a small mirror over a shelf on the rear wall , a calendar beside it . In the left corner stands the Star-Wagon . HANUS and STEPHEN are revealed still clinging to the handles as the lights come up . Their voices are heard from semi-darkness for a few moments . HANUS WICKS He could n't have dropped the nitroglycerin . STEPHEN MINCH Why ? HANUS WICKS Because he did n't drop it coming in . STEPHEN MINCH Maybe what we heard was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve , look where we are . There 's the car you built . And there 's the calendar you figured out  --  p. 53 STEPHEN MINCH Seeing the calendarJuly 3rd . I told you it was out of sync . It was set for the fourth . HANUS WICKS I never thought I 'd see the old bicycle shop again . STEPHEN MINCH No.  --  I thought it was larger . HANUS WICKS So did I.  --  Gee , it 's a peach of a little shop . The lights come up full , and they are revealed as young men . That 's big Minnie 's bicycle . She ran into a hydrant and bent the front fork . I 'm supposed to be working on it . STEPHEN MINCH Now I 'll tell you what I think , Hanus . When we let go the handles we 'll go right back into the old groove .  --  So we better figure what we 're going to do . HANUS WICKS Jeez , it scares you .  --  Look in that mirror , Steve . STEPHEN MINCH What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? Did I look like that ? HANUS WICKS And look at me . No wonder I never got married . STEPHEN MINCH Maybe it 'll be different this time . p. 54 HANUS WICKS What are you going to do-now you 're back here , Steve ? STEPHEN MINCH I 'm going to change everything . Martha can marry the celluloid collar boy , the way she wanted to . I 'm going to marry the other one . HANUS WICKS Do you think you can do it ? STEPHEN MINCH I 'm going to try . HANUS WICKS Did you remember there was a whip socket on the dash-board ? STEPHEN MINCH Sure . That 's so if the engine stops and you have to use a horse you 'll have a whip to drive with . HANUS WICKS Is n't that the prettiest little car you ever saw ? STEPHEN MINCH I never liked any other car as much as that one . MARTHA MINCH OutsideStephen  --  Stephen  --  will you pump up a tire for me ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's Martha . Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . MARTHA , a young girl in black bloomers , wheels her bicycle into the shop . Oh , oh  --  oh oh  --  what the  --  HANUS takes the bicycle from MARTHA. p. 55 MARTHA MINCH How do you like them ? She turns about . STEPHEN MINCH Fine  --  fine . MARTHA MINCH No you do n't . STEPHEN MINCH I never thought I 'd see you in things like that . MARTHA MINCH We 're all going to get them  --  all the girls in the choir . Do n't you think they 're nice , Steve ? STEPHEN MINCH Well  --  they  --  they  --  they do n't leave much to the imagination , do they ? MARTHA MINCH You 're horrid ! You 're perfectly horrible . She sidles behind a chair , blushing . STEPHEN MINCH Fascinated in spite of himself No , they 're all right . They 're very  --  fetching . MARTHA MINCH I thought you 'd like them anyway . They 're just to ride a bicycle in . STEPHEN MINCH I know . HANUS is busy pumping up the tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can just look . STEPHEN MINCH They 'll certainly look , all right . p. 56 MARTHA MINCH I 'd better go , I guess  --  STEPHEN MINCH I mean , a fellow 's pretty funny if he does n't look at you , no matter what you 've got on . MARTHA MINCH Stupid . But she smiles . STEPHEN MINCH Did I say something wrong ? MARTHA MINCH If I stood here all day , and waited , you 'd never think of the right thing to say . STEPHEN MINCH I like you just as much as if I did . Maybe more . MARTHA MINCH There 's choir practice tonight , you know . STEPHEN MINCH I was coming . MARTHA MINCH Mrs. Rutledge says you have a really good voice if you 'd work at it . STEPHEN MINCH How does a person work at his voice ? MARTHA MINCH Takes lessons , silly . STEPHEN MINCH I 'd feel pretty silly taking lessons in how to sing . Anybody can sing . MARTHA MINCH She says you have an excellent natural placement , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know anything about placement , either . p. 57 MARTHA MINCH It 's where you place your voice , singing in your mouth and not back in your throat . STEPHEN MINCH It does n't sound like a thing you 'd need to take lessons for . MARTHA MINCH Some people never can learn it . It 's awfully hard for me , but you do it without trying . STEPHEN MINCH What 's phrasing ? MARTHA MINCH Meanings . Bringing out the meanings by where you breathe and things like that . HANUS WICKS Every time a person goes to Europe he comes back with a lot of foreign notions . Now they 're teaching you how to sing . What I always say if you want to sing , sing , and if you do n't , play the piano . MARTHA MINCH I guess if you pump up that tire you 'll be doing all that 's expected of you . HANUS WICKS I pump the organ for you , do n't I ? MARTHA MINCH To STEVEYou probably have n't even looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have . I learned it by heart . But there was n't anybody to play the music for me . MARTHA MINCH We could stay after choir practice tonight . p. 58 STEPHEN MINCH All right . There 's an awkward squawk outside , and STEVE looks out over her head . It 's Arlington 's White Steamer . MARTHA MINCH If they 're coming in , I 'm going . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , do n't go . MARTHA MINCH Maybe you think I do n't know what Hallie Arlington 's up to . She 's got her cap all set to marry you . STEPHEN MINCH Oh now , say , Martha  --  what in the world would she want to marry me for ? MARTHA MINCH I do n't know , but I 'll bet her family 's relieved to have her running after you after some of the specimens she 's run after .  --  Give me my machine . MR . ARLINGTON OutsideNow you want a bicycle , I suppose ? HALLIE ARLINGTON OutsideOh no ; I would n't think of riding one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn , dear . It 's pretty simple , but after all  --  HALLIE ARLINGTON Entering with her fatherWhy , Martha  --  I did n't know you in that outlandish  --  why it is n't even a skirt ! HALLIE wears a duster and goggles. p. 59 MARTHA MINCH No , it 's bloomers . Good-bye . She trundles the bicycle out . HALLIE ARLINGTON But is n't that  --  almost immoral  --  ? I mean , are n't there laws  --  ? MR . ARLINGTON As a matter of fact there are . It 's illegal for a girl to wear pantaloons . HALLIE ARLINGTON HopefulWill she be arrested ? MR . ARLINGTON She ought to be . HALLIE ARLINGTON The sheriff might see her going up the street . MR . ARLINGTON Hank ? Yes , he might . HANUS WICKS MutteringProbably Hank likes a pair of legs as much as anybody in town . You do n't lose your taste for legs by being sheriff . HALLIE ARLINGTON What did you say ? HANUS WICKS Ma'am ? I was n't saying anything . MR . ARLINGTON Tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating around the bush . That expert that looked over your auto-mobile made a very interesting report . Very interesting . They all look at the carriage . He says for a young man you 've done a most unusual job . p. 60 HALLIE ARLINGTON It 's much prettier than our car . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , no . It 's just made out of odds and ends . MR . ARLINGTON What I wanted to ask you was , is it patented ? STEPHEN MINCH Why no , I just made it for fun  --  to ride around in . Not much use trying to patent it . Anyway it 'd cost a lot . MR . ARLINGTON Should be done , though . STEPHEN MINCH To tell the truth , it 's not really original . I read about the engine in the papers . MR . ARLINGTON Well , I do n't want to over-praise it , but that expert said it had some remarkable features  --  the way the valve 's set , for example . And the way it started  --  he said that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a strap around the drive shaft . MR . ARLINGTON It saves cranking , does n't it ? STEPHEN MINCH Oh , you do n't have to crank it . Hardly ever . MR . ARLINGTON I wonder if you 'd start it for us . STEPHEN MINCH Sure thing . Open those doors , will you , Hanus ? He picks up a pint bottle and looks through it . Gasoline 's running pretty low . HANUS opens the end doors . STEPHEN empties the bottle into the fuel tank. p. 61 HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'm so excited ! I ca n't breathe !  --  Will it go ? STEPHEN MINCH Once in a while she 's balky . He climbs in . It 's going to make a lot of noise , you know . So brace yourselves for it . MR . ARLINGTON Burns gasoline ? STEPHEN MINCH That 's right . He pulls a strap on the foot-board , pulls it again , again and again . HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'm going to be so disappointed if it does n't go . STEPHEN MINCH Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls the strap again , and is rewarded by a terrific concussion . Just one , but it blows HALLIE backward . HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'm all right ! It did n't hit me ! STEPHEN MINCH It wo n't hurt you . He gets another explosion . HANUS WICKS Has she got power ! Land o ' Goshen , has she got power ! STEPHEN MINCH This time . Another pull and the engine starts . STEVE lets in the clutch and the car moves. p. 62 HALLIE ARLINGTON Wait ! Wait ! I want to ride in it ! She climbs in beside STEVE , and they drive out the door . MR . ARLINGTON I wonder if the thing 's safe . HANUS WICKS With him , it is . He can spin it on a four-leaf clover . He can do anything with it . MR . ARLINGTON Do you know much about it ? HANUS WICKS I helped him build it . MR . ARLINGTON Why did he put the valve on the top ? HANUS WICKS Saves fourteen moving parts , setting it there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in the carriage factory ? HANUS WICKS Me ? Maybe I 'm better off here . MR . ARLINGTON He ca n't pay you much . HANUS WICKS I like it here . MR . ARLINGTON I see . The car is heard approaching outside , and now suddenly reenters with a roar , stopping abruptly where it was . HALLIE ARLINGTON That was n't far enough , Steve ! You only went round the yard ! STEPHEN MINCH We 'll go some other time . p. 63 HALLIE ARLINGTON That 's a promise . STEPHEN MINCH When I have more gasoline . It 's almost empty . HALLIE ARLINGTON Tomorrow ? STEPHEN MINCH Tomorrow 's the picnic , you know . He helps her down . HALLIE ARLINGTON Are you coming ? STEPHEN MINCH The Fourth of July ? Certainly . HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'll make up a specially good basket  --  if you 'll carry it . STEPHEN MINCH Wait till I see which is the heaviest . HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'll put bricks in mine . HANUS WICKS Oh , oh . MR . ARLINGTON Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bush . Just for the fun of it I 'd like to buy that car  --  as she stands  --  including all future rights , patents and so on . STEPHEN MINCH You can use it any time . MR . ARLINGTON I 'd like to buy it . STEPHEN MINCH It 's not much to buy . MR . ARLINGTON I 'll give you five hundred . p. 64 STEPHEN MINCH Five hundred ! For that ! MR . ARLINGTON Is it a fair price ? STEPHEN MINCH Fair ! It 's robbery ! MR . ARLINGTON I would n't want to go any higher . STEPHEN MINCH Good Lord , no ! I 'd be robbing you . MR . ARLINGTON Well , I 'll take a chance . STEPHEN MINCH I do n't really want to sell it , you know . It 's been a lot of fun , and I like to have it around , but  --  MR . ARLINGTON I just made an offer , that 's all . Take it or leave it . STEPHEN MINCH I suppose I 'd be crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over if you want to  --  A pause STEPHEN MINCH No . I 'll take five hundred . MR . ARLINGTON Good . He offers a hand . Call it done . STEPHEN MINCH Shaking with himYes , sir . MR . ARLINGTON And I hope it wo n't be the last business we do , either . In fact , I 'll give you a chance to put that five hundred right back into my carriage factory with me , if you like , and it 'll start earning for you from the word go . Only not if you 'd rather do something else , mind you . You do just as you please . p. 65 STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir . MR . ARLINGTON Hallie there 's taken quite a fancy to you , and maybe you two could hit it off , and we could sort of make a little combine . I would n't mind it a bit . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir . HALLIE ARLINGTON Why , papa , what are you talking about ? MR . ARLINGTON Just trouble to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in looking ahead a little and anticipating your grandchildren . If she does n't have ' em with one she 'll have ' em with another , so it might as well be a good one .  --  As a matter of fact , Steve , I would n't advise you to sell that machine unless we can sort of work out a combination . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir . There is a sound of escaping steam outside . MR . ARLINGTON Well , come on , puss  --  our boiler 's blowing off out here . Tomorrow 's the Fourth . See you the fifth  --  and we 'll fix it all up . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , sir . HALLIE ARLINGTON Au revoir . STEPHEN MINCH ' Bye , Hallie . HALLIE and ARLINGTON go out . HANUS WICKS Jeez , I hate to see it go . p. 66 STEPHEN MINCH We can make another one , and make it better . You know what I ought to do ? HANUS WICKS No . STEPHEN MINCH I ought to hook up with her , and put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WICKS You wo n't do it . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , I will .  --  I feel a little hollow , though . He walks back to the window , looks out , then , turning , touches the Star-Wagon as if by accident . He takes one of the handles . Hanus ? HANUS WICKS Yeah . STEPHEN MINCH Come here a minute . HANUS goes to him . Take hold of this thing . This is a hell of an afternoon . I did n't like it the first time and I do n't like it any better-now . I want to move on a little . HANUS WICKS Why do n't you do something different ? You 're doing exactly what you did before . You tried to marry Hallie that time , but you did n't . STEPHEN MINCH I know . I 'll fix it all up tomorrow . HANUS WICKS Well , if you 're going to press that button I wish you 'd pick some time before a meal , and not after . I hate to be full of food and not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said something about choir practice . I guess I could see Martha just once more . He tips the dome , then replaces it . Push the button , will you , Hanus ? HANUS does so . The lights darken  --  then go out entirely . CURTAIN p. 68 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO : SCENE II SCENE : Faintly and far away , so that you ca n't be sure you hear it at all , the strains of Handel 's " Largo " creep into the theatre , played on a pipe organ . As it approaches the last chord the lights begin to seep in , and the scene is found to be a choir loft in a small church . MARTHA sits at the organ , playing ; a choir of eight , including STEVE and HALLIE , are seated just in front of the manuals , and MRS . RUTLEDGE , elegant in black lace , stands before them . HANUS has opened the little door behind which he sits to pump the organ . The pump handle is visible across his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , OGLETHORPE , CHRISTABEL , and DELLA . MRS . RUTLEDGE That 's excellent , Martha . I have no criticism of your playing . I might only suggest that it would be as well to omit some of the deep pedal notes which require a rather unlady-like extension of the lower limbs . MARTHA MINCH I love the low notes on the pedals . MRS . RUTLEDGE I know , dear . But one occasionally sacrifices art to what one might call the decencies . I 've hesitated to speak of this , but there are men in every congregation who might be distracted from their devotions by the vision of feminine proportions in more or less athletic attitudes . The playing of the pipe organ requires the use of the feet , but a woman of refinement will instinctively confine herself to the middle register , easily accessible without  --  without  --  uh  --  without  --  p. 69 HANUS WICKS She means without spreading the legs apart . MRS . RUTLEDGE You may close your door , Hanus . HANUS WICKS Yes , ma'am . He does so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , without extravagant motion under the skirt . MARTHA MINCH I could wear my bicycle bloomers , of course  --  There is a little smiling in the choir . MRS . RUTLEDGE That will do , Martha . You must accept my criticism seriously , and in the spirit in which it is given , or I shall refuse to continue longer in my position as leader . A silenceIt 's growing late , and we have one more hymn to prepare for the evening service , also Mr. Minch 's solo . Turn to 172 in the Victory Songs . The CHOIR rises , exhibiting the styles of the period , and holding hymn-books open . MARTHA plays a three-chord prelude , and they sing , Mrs. RUTLEDGE beating time . THE CHOIR Hark , ' t is the Shepherd 's voice I hear , Out on the desert dark and drear , Calling the sheep who 've gone astray , Far from the shepherd 's fold away . CHORUS  --  Bring them in , bring them in , Bring them in from the fields of sin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wand'ring ones to Jesus . p. 70 MRS . RUTLEDGE Third stanza , please . THE CHOIR Out in the desert , hear their cry , Out on the mountains wild and high , Hark ! ' t is the Master speaks to Thee  --  " Go find my sheep where'er they be . " CHORUS  --  Bring them in , bring them in , Bring them in from the fields of sin ; Bring them in , bring them in , Bring the wand'ring ones to Jesus . MRS . RUTLEDGE Now the chorus again very softly . Very , very softly . She beats time . THE CHOIR PianissimoBring them in , bring them in , Bring them in from the fields of sin ; Bring them in , bring them in , Bring the wand'ring ones to Jesus . MRS . RUTLEDGE Very , very moving . There 's nothing so affecting as a delicate nuance of tone  --  a thing for you all to remember . And now  --  She snaps open the gold watch , worn on a long chain at her waist , and gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be at the foreign missions meeting before nine . I fear I 'll have to omit the solo after all .  --  Dear , dear , it 's vexing  --  MARTHA MINCH I could stay and play for Mr. Minch. p. 71 MRS . RUTLEDGE Not without proper chaperoning , of course . I fear it 's out of the question . HANUS WICKS Opening his door I 'm here . MRS . RUTLEDGE You may close your door , Master Hanus . He does so . Your presence would hardly suffice . No , we 'll dismiss now . The CHOIR begins to move away . But I am vexed . If Mr. Duffy and Miss Arlington could remain  --  HALLIE ARLINGTON Yes , of course , Mrs. Rutledge . HANUS WICKS Opening his door againThe janitor 's out there . And if you knew how hot it was in this coffin you 'd let me leave the lid off . MRS . RUTLEDGE Will you be quiet , and draw the door to ? You have no sense of propriety ! I suffer through every service in this church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , a veritable gargoyle , staring out at the congregation from the bowels of the instrument ! HANUS WICKS That 's not a nice word . He closes up again . MRS . RUTLEDGE And now you take it upon yourself to correct me ! p. 72 HALLIE ARLINGTON We could stay , Mrs. Rutledge . I 'd like to stay . MARTHA MINCH And Mr. Minch and I have n't the least interest in each other , have we , Stephen ? STEPHEN MINCH No 'm , I mean  --  MRS . RUTLEDGE My dear Martha  --  it is n't that I do n't trust you implicitly  --  it 's only that there are certain civilized usages.  --  However , in this case  --  . I shall instruct the janitor to close the church within half an hour . She turns to go . And I shall be gratified if some one of you will convey my displeasure to  --  Master Hanus  --  and inform him that he will not be expected to join us on our picnic tomorrow  --  nor in any future merry-makings  --  She bites her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL REIGER Yes , ma'am . MRS . RUTLEDGE Good night . THE CHOIR In scattering chorusGood night , Mrs. Rutledge . Mrs. RUTLEDGE has taken a step or two toward the exit when HANUS ' door opens , showing him poised like a bird on his bench , his arms drawn up to imitate wings. p. 73 HANUS WICKS FlappingCuckoo ! Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! His door shuts . Mrs. RUTLEDGE pauses , biting her lip again , then thinks better of it and goes out . PAUL REIGER Good Lord ! STEPHEN MINCH Well , she had it coming . MARTHA MINCH Stephen ! How can you encourage such actions ? STEPHEN MINCH Well , but , Martha  --  MARTHA MINCH How can you ! HALLIE ARLINGTON She really likes you , Hanus . That 's why she says all those things . HANUS WICKS I 'll bet it is . I like you , too . PAUL REIGER Thought maybe I could see you home , Martha . MARTHA MINCH You 'd have to wait half an hour , Paul . Do n't bother . PAUL REIGER Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to . Stephen will see me home . PAUL REIGER Well , in that case who 's going to Schmid 's for ice-cream ? SEVERAL I am ! PAUL REIGER Come on then . p. 74 OGLETHORPE So long , all you cuckoos . PAUL REIGER See you at Schmid 's . STEPHEN MINCH Fine . They all leave except STEVE , MARTHA , DUFFY , HALLIE , and HANUS . CHARLES DUFFY Do I have to wait around while the bicycle man makes noises like " Jerusalem The Golden ? " STEPHEN MINCH It 's no pleasure to have you here . CHARLES DUFFY It 'll be punishment to me . HALLIE ARLINGTON Oh , please stay ; Mrs. Rutledge would be furious if we did n't . CHARLES DUFFY She 'll never know . HALLIE ARLINGTON I want to hear Stevie sing . CHARLES DUFFY I do n't , and can you blame me ? MARTHA MINCH We 'll come over for ice-cream afterward . HALLIE ARLINGTON Will you , Steve ? STEPHEN MINCH Right away  --  as soon as this is over . HALLIE ARLINGTON All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , now . DUFFY and HALLIE go out. p. 75 MARTHA MINCH Maybe you 'd rather have somebody else play for you . STEPHEN MINCH What 's the matter ? MARTHA MINCH Oh , nothing . Where 's the music ? STEPHEN MINCH Here . MARTHA MINCH Tell him to pump . STEPHEN MINCH Give it air , Hanus.  --  I do n't know this very well , you know . I just picked it out with one finger . MARTHA MINCH It does n't matter . Some people just sing , you know . They do n't need any instruction . They just sing like birds . STEPHEN MINCH If you do n't want to play for me  --  MARTHA MINCH You come in here , see . I 'll play the prelude . She plays the opening bars , STEVE watching her nervously . When she reaches the solo he begins to sing , at first tentatively , then with more confidence till at the end he is doing his excellent best . The song is " Jerusalem The Golden , " and both the organist and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Song I  --  Jerusalem the golden ! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With milk and honey blest , Beneath thy contemplation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sink heart and voice opprest.I know not  --  oh , I know not &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What joys await me there , What radiancy of glory , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What bliss beyond compare ! II  --  They stand , those halls of Zion , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All jubilant with song , And bright with many a loved one &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all the angel throng.There lifts the throne of David , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there , from toil released , The shout of them that triumph , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The song of them that feast . As STEVE finishes , MARTHA puts her head down on the music-rest and begins to sob p. 76 STEPHEN MINCH What is it , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH It 's so beautiful , that 's all . And you do sing like an angel .  --  I 'm sorry  --  I said what I did . He puts out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch me . We have to go . STEPHEN MINCH Not yet .  --  Please . MARTHA MINCH Why ? STEPHEN MINCH I ca n't go just yet .  --  The music  --  does something to you  --  so that you want  --  I do n't know  --  so that you want  --  more music  --  only so much greater  --  MARTHA MINCH Taking his hand suddenlyDo you feel that , too ? STEPHEN MINCH I do right now . MARTHA MINCH Oh . I thought nobody felt that but me . Only I could never say it  --  so well  --  STEPHEN MINCH I never say anything well . MARTHA MINCH Would n't it be marvellous if we could be great people  --  and I could play and you could sing  --  ? Somewhere  --  I could almost imagine it  --  STEPHEN MINCH That would be wonderful . p. 77 MARTHA MINCH Only  --  there 's nobody that knows enough to teach us  --  out here .  --  We 'd have to be where people love music  --  where a whole nation loves music  --  not here  --  STEPHEN MINCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really does n't , Steve . STEPHEN MINCH Is n't she kind of a fake , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH Maybe she is . No , it is n't fair to say that . She does as well as she can . STEPHEN MINCH I guess an old maid never could be much . MARTHA MINCH She 's not an old maid . She 's a widow . STEPHEN MINCH Well , she acts like an old maid . MARTHA MINCH Yes , she does act like one . STEPHEN MINCH You 're marvellous , Martha . MARTHA MINCH No , I 'm not . I do n't like to hear you say that . I 'm silly , and all I know is just what I could learn in high school , and probably I 'll never get any farther  --  STEPHEN MINCH But I do think you 're marvellous . Do n't you like to hear me say it ? MARTHA MINCH No. p. 78 STEPHEN MINCH Why ? MARTHA MINCH Because I had a glimpse of something  --  in the music  --  that was better than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss you . She takes her hand away . I want to love someone  --  that 's much too good for me  --  and a person like that  --  never would love me  --  but that 's why I 'd love him . STEPHEN MINCH Who is it , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH Nobody I ever saw . But you might be like that  --  some time . STEPHEN MINCH I wonder if I could . HANUS opens his little door softly , sees them close together , and half closes it again . MARTHA MINCH Does it seem to you as if we said all this once before , once long ago ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes . MARTHA MINCH Maybe we did . Away back when the earth was n't the same  --  and even the north star was n't the north star at all . STEPHEN MINCH When you were a queen and I was a slave ? MARTHA MINCH No . I would n't want you to be a slave . He puts out a hand again . Do n't touch me . It makes me feel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MINCH Maybe I am . MARTHA MINCH I guess so . I guess we both are . Only I like to think , just tonight  --  that there 's something we can have  --  that 's like the music  --  nobler than we are  --  STEPHEN MINCH I know . MARTHA MINCH Do you mind if I play a little more  --  to see if it will come back ? STEPHEN MINCH No , Martha . HANUS begins to pump , and MARTHA touches the keys , playing the Largo again . The lights dim and go out . CURTAIN p. 80 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT TWO : SCENE III SCENE : The picnic ground is at the edge of a cliff . Above one can see the party gathering with baskets on the grass . Beneath them a shallow cave hollows into the rock , hidden from those on the upper level . A ledge from the side affords an entrance to the cave . Mrs. RUTLEDGE and the members of the choir are arriving at the picnic site . As they come in STEVE is carrying HALLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings up the rear . MRS . RUTLEDGE Before anything is unpacked it becomes my duty to say again the few words with which I prefaced our last year 's outing . Your attention , please , Master Hanus . It is , of course , incumbent on all of us to conduct ourselves at all times like ladies and gentlemen . At all times , but even more when an occasion arises which places a certain amount of responsibility upon us . I am here , as you know , in the thankless capacity of chaperon . You will make my duties easier , and my day pleasanter , by conforming to certain rules of decorum , rules of which you are all aware . It is , no doubt , more largely incumbent on the young ladies of our company than on the gentlemen to maintain the standards of society , for women are in general the civilizing and restraining influence . But I shall expect complete cooperation from the young men as well .  --  Hallie ! Miss Arlington ! That is exactly the kind of thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman 's pocket ! For any purpose ! p. 81 HALLIE ARLINGTON I was taking a piece of candy , Mrs. Rutledge . MRS . RUTLEDGE If Mr. Minch wishes to offer you candy he will do so . HALLIE ARLINGTON But he would n't give me any . He said if I wanted it I could help myself . MRS . RUTLEDGE Stephen ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes , ma'am . MRS . RUTLEDGE Is that cooperation ? STEPHEN MINCH No , ma'am . HANUS WICKS She wanted to put her hand in his pocket , that 's what she wanted . MRS . RUTLEDGE Hanus , be quiet . HANUS WICKS Yes , ma'am .  --  Only what you think a fellow carries candy for except for bait ? MRS . RUTLEDGE For what ? HANUS WICKS Nothing . PAUL REIGER He said for bait . MRS . RUTLEDGE Master Hanus was not invited to this outing . He is here on sufferance only . The less attention paid to him the better . HANUS WICKS Yes , ma'am . MRS . RUTLEDGE Now , shall we spread our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I must keep you all within sight at all times . The girls will understand my reasons for that request , and will obey implicitly , I am sure . I am responsible to your parents . She steps out to the right . Martha and Della , if you 'll help me for a moment . MARTHA , DELLA , REIGER and OGLETHORPE follow her out. p. 82 HALLIE ARLINGTON Reaching into Steve 's pocketUm  --  candy corn  --  I love it . HANUS WICKS Chicken feed . HALLIE ARLINGTON Hanus does n't like me . STEPHEN MINCH Who cares ? He 's just jealous . HALLIE ARLINGTON He ought to go home anyway . He was n't invited . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , Hanus can stay . HALLIE ARLINGTON You always have Hanus around . STEPHEN MINCH Sometimes he 's useful . HALLIE ARLINGTON You think more of him than you do of me , do n't you ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's different . HALLIE ARLINGTON What are we going to do after we have lunch ? CHARLES DUFFY Mrs. Rutledge said something about playing Sacks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's all go down under the ledge . STEPHEN MINCH What good 's that ? HALLIE ARLINGTON She wo n't know where we are . STEPHEN MINCH Oh . p. 83 HALLIE ARLINGTON Would you go , Charley ? CHARLES DUFFY Sure , I 'm game . It 's better than Sacks to the Mill . HALLIE ARLINGTON Would you , Christabel ? CHRISTABEL We really should n't , Hallie . HALLIE ARLINGTON I know , but just for fun  --  oh , Steve , please , pretty please . STEPHEN MINCH All right . HALLIE ARLINGTON And then afterward we could slip away and go swimming . CHRISTABEL Oh , Hallie ! HALLIE ARLINGTON It 's oceans of fun to go swimming . HANUS WICKS Take her out and drown her . HALLIE ARLINGTON Anyway , it 's not very nice of you not to do what we girls want to do when we 're on a picnic , is it , Christabel ? CHRISTABEL Well , if they do n't want to  --  HALLIE ARLINGTON Oh , if they do n't want to we 'll get somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? HALLIE ARLINGTON In my basket . You can sneak it out when she is n't looking . p. 84 STEPHEN MINCH Gee , you 're a hell-bender , are n't you ? HALLIE ARLINGTON I would n't go in with just everybody , but I would with you . CHARLES DUFFY Ah , come on , Christabel  --  say you 'll get wet . CHRISTABEL I never did such a thing  --  but if Hallie does  --  HALLIE ARLINGTON It 's oceans of fun  --  and wo n't the old hen be furious  --  ! MRS . RUTLEDGE At rightLunch is ready , everybody ! HALLIE ARLINGTON Um  --  am I hungry  --  come on , Stevie ! She runs out to the right , beckoning . STEVE is about to follow her . MARTHA comes in from right with REIGER . DUFFY and CHRISTABEL go out toward the lunch . PAUL REIGER TO MARTHALet 's sit over here . MARTHA MINCH TO STEVEI brought you something , Steve . STEPHEN MINCH Thanks , Martha . MARTHA MINCH Want to sit with us ? STEPHEN MINCH TornI guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 85 MARTHA MINCH Is n't this a heavenly day ? STEPHEN MINCH I guess I had n't noticed . Getting pretty hot , is n't it ? HANUS WICKS Why does n't it ever rain ? MARTHA MINCH Listen to Hanus . Wishing it would rain . STEPHEN MINCH That 's his idea of a picnic . HANUS WICKS I like rain ! Ca n't you ever get the idea a fellow might like rain ? Same as you like this darn hot weather ! MARTHA MINCH TO STEVEIt is warm , but then it 's July . You could open the top button of your shirt . This way . She does it for him . PAUL REIGER I 'm beginning to feel like a crowd . He gets up . STEPHEN MINCH Just the right kind of day to go swimming . MARTHA MINCH Boys have most of the fun , do n't they ? STEPHEN MINCH Why ? REIGER goes out right . CHRISTABEL runs in past him and out to the left . DUFFY enters and looks round for her . MARTHA MINCH Oh , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't girls swim ? MARTHA MINCH I suppose they could .  --  Did Hallie ask you to go swimming ? STEPHEN MINCH Maybe . How did you know ? MARTHA MINCH Oh , she always does . Why did you carry her basket ? STEPHEN MINCH She asked me to . MARTHA MINCH Did n't I tell you ? HALLIE comes in with two plates of food , sees STEVE occupied , bites her lip , and goes up to DUFFY , who is about to follow CHRISTABEL . HALLIE ARLINGTON It 's awfully good , Charley . Pt de foie gras . CHARLES DUFFY Is it ? The way I look at it , it 's liver . HALLIE ARLINGTON You always say the most delightful things ! I brought it for you . CHARLES DUFFY Taking itThanks . If I put two together maybe they 'll amount to something . HALLIE ARLINGTON A big strong man like you ought to eat more than a girl . CHARLES DUFFY Oh , I keep up my strength , do n't worry . HALLIE ARLINGTON I love to see men eat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pounds and pounds of things . I just sit and watch them and think how extraordinary they are . p. 87 CHARLES DUFFY In that case I could show you a good time every day , and no charge at all . This is woman 's food . HALLIE ARLINGTON That 's what I always say . Sandwiches are just woman 's food . She looks at STEVE and MARTHA , then whispers to DUFFY . CHARLES DUFFY Why not ? HALLIE and DUFFY start out left , HALLIE looking back a moment . STEVE glances at them as they go out . MARTHA MINCH It 's a free country , you know . STEPHEN MINCH What do you mean ? MARTHA MINCH If you want to see how she looks in the completely , now 's your time . HALLIE ARLINGTON Outside , shriekingOh , Charley  --  the things you think of to say ! Charley ! STEPHEN MINCH I can live without . MARTHA MINCH You 'll be the first ever refused . STEPHEN MINCH Well , that 's something . MARTHA MINCH Do you think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN MINCH I never noticed . p. 88 MARTHA MINCH I am , though . She rises . Oh , I ca n't bear it  --  and I wo n't ! Why should I care whether you like me or not ? Why does a girl have to care whether anybody likes her or not ? It 's disgusting  --  to care . It 's a curse  --  and we carry it with us everywhere  --  just like the curse of Eve ! There should n't be men and women ! There should be just  --  people . STEPHEN MINCH Why , Martha . I never heard you talk that way . MARTHA MINCH You 're a man . You would n't understand . STEPHEN MINCH Where are you going ? MARTHA MINCH Anywhere ! Nowhere ! Only do n't come with me unless you want to . I wo n't play any game for anybody . It 's not worth it ! She goes out left . STEVE starts after her , and then pauses . STEPHEN MINCH Hanus . HANUS WICKS Yeah , Steve . STEPHEN MINCH It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going right straight ahead and marry Martha again . And she 'll hate me for it  --  all over again . HANUS WICKS Well , if that 's the way it is  --  that 's the way it is . STEPHEN MINCH We came back to get another chance , and we ca n't go all through it again . Only  --  I 'm falling for her again , Hanus . I 'm in love with her all over again  --  and I just ca n't quit .  --  p. 89 HANUS WICKS What can I do ? STEPHEN MINCH You 'd better jam the machine , Hanus . Do n't spoil it too much . Just fix it so it does n't work for a couple of minutes . HANUS WICKS I guess I can do it . STEPHEN MINCH Lift the wire off the wheel . Do n't break anything . Lift it off and then put it back on again . HANUS WICKS I 'll go back to the shop now . STEPHEN MINCH All right . And afterward you 'd better find me and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STEVE goes out left . Mrs. Rutledge . Calling from the rightHallie ! Charley ! Martha ! Stephen ! Mr. Oglethorpe ! She enters from the right . Where are they ? HANUS WICKS On his way outI do n't know , ma'am . HALLIE and DUFFY , out of sight of Mrs. RUTLEDGE , go softly along the ledge to the right . MRS . RUTLEDGE I was gone only a moment  --  one moment , and when I returned there was no one , not one of them  --  after all I said about the behavior to be expected of ladies and gentlemen ! Is there no such thing as honor among young people ? Is the whole world changing  --  so that there 's no principle left , so that girls do n't care what 's said of them  --  or  --  or what they do ? Hallie ! Martha ! She peers over the ledge , then sits. p. 90 HANUS WICKS They just went away by themselves to spoon . They do n't like anybody to see them when they 're spooning . HALLIE and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you  --  you unspeakable person  --  you 're the only one left here to tell me.  --  Oh , I shall die of shame and rage ! What use am I , what good am I in this world ? When I wanted to be so kind to them , and they have so little respect for me  --  She breaks down and cries . I want to die , I want to die and be out of it all  --  alone in the world  --  and nobody but these nasty children  --  HANUS WICKS Why , Mrs. Rutledge  --  MRS . RUTLEDGE Do n't call me Mrs. Rutledge ! I 'm human as much as they are  --  and they 've no right to  --  oh , what good am I ? I want to die  --  HANUS WICKS Gee , I 'm sorry  --  MRS . RUTLEDGE I do n't hate you , Hanus . I do n't hate anybody . Only you say such unspeakable things -- and I 'm so alone  --  She pauses and wipes her eyes . Would you  --  would you sit here with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes  --  ? HALLIE and DUFFY gape at each other , listening . Would you please ? p. 91 HANUS WICKS Me ? MRS . RUTLEDGE Never mind . HANUS WICKS I 've got to go back to the bicycle shop . MRS . RUTLEDGE Very well , Hanus . I 'll tell them . HANUS goes to the right . Mrs. RUTLEDGE rises and looks around . Hallie ! Martha ! DUFFY and HALLIE slip out to the left along the ledge below her . MARTHA and STEPHEN come in along the ledge from the right . Charley ! Stephen ! Mr. Oglethorpe ! She goes out to the left . Stephen ! STEPHEN MINCH She was calling me . MARTHA MINCH Seating herself on the rockDo n't go . STEPHEN MINCH She seemed pretty excited . MARTHA MINCH I know , but  --  we 're not children  --  and I want you here . STEPHEN MINCH Sitting beside herThen I wo n't answer anything but a fire-alarm . MARTHA MINCH Are you glad you sold the automobile ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes . p. 92 MARTHA MINCH Why ? STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop . And when I have a real place  --  I have some ideas  --  things I want to make  --  MARTHA MINCH Automobiles ? STEPHEN MINCH Maybe  --  oh lots of things . MARTHA MINCH I thought you might think of going in with Mr. Arlington . STEPHEN MINCH I do n't know . MARTHA leans back and closes her eyes . Let me put my coat under your head . MARTHA MINCH Would you ? He does so , is tempted to kiss her , then refrains . STEPHEN MINCH Do you want to talk about music ? MARTHA MINCH If you do . STEPHEN MINCH I do n't know enough . You 're lovely , leaning back there . MARTHA MINCH You know , Stephen , a girl that tries to be good is always at a disadvantage . STEPHEN MINCH How ? MARTHA MINCH I 've never let anybody kiss me , except in games . Some girls let you kiss them , do n't they ? p. 93 STEPHEN MINCH Only I 'd never expect you to . I would n't ask it . MARTHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare .  --  It was true , what you said last night , about wanting something better than just being like the others . MARTHA MINCH Only today  --  I do n't mind at all --  STEPHEN MINCH IncredulousYou mean -- if I touch you ? MARTHA MINCH Her eyes still closedYes . STEPHEN MINCH Taking her hand reverentlyI thought you'd -- be angry . MARTHA MINCH Some days a girl wants -- just that -- only she does n't dare -- tell you --  A pause STEPHEN MINCH Leaning over to kiss her lips lightlyYou 're sweeter than honeysuckle . MARTHA MINCH It 's sweet -- but it 's terrible -- and tragic , too . STEPHEN MINCH Is it ? MARTHA MINCH Because we 're alone here -- in this world -- and so many things could happen -- but when I let you kiss me then only one thing can happen -- and it 's frightening --  because if you make a mistake -- there 's never any way out --  p. 94 STEPHEN MINCH It would n't be a mistake , Martha . MARTHA MINCH Men are always so sure . It 's like a man to be sure . But a girl . She sees so many things that could happen --  and she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hungry for something -- maybe she lets the wrong person kiss her -- and then she 's a slave -- to what he wants to do . All her life long . STEPHEN MINCH Do you think I might be the wrong one ? MARTHA MINCH Oh , Stephen -- would you always be good to me ? STEPHEN MINCH Always . MARTHA MINCH But you do n't know . None of us know what we 'll be . STEPHEN MINCH I know I 'd always be good to you . MARTHA MINCH Men are so sure . STEPHEN MINCH Could I kiss you again , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH Yes.  --  He does so . There 's nothing we can do . There 's no use trying to be wise . STEPHEN MINCH You mean we just have to fall in love -- and -- and take our medicine ? MARTHA MINCH Oh , you poor Stephen -- is it as bad as that ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's what I want -- that 's all I know -- the only thing I want . p. 95 MARTHA MINCH You say the most blundering , stupid things -- and then you say just the right thing -- and oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking her in his armsAnyway I have the five hundred now , and we can get married . MARTHA MINCH Oh , but you 'll need that -- to put in the shop --  STEPHEN MINCH Only a little of it . MARTHA MINCH Stephen , Stephen -- I do n't want to spoil your chances --  STEPHEN MINCH My chances --  ! I 'm going to be a great man , Martha . MARTHA MINCH And I wo n't make it more difficult ? STEPHEN MINCH You 'll make it possible.  - -  I do n't care about a lot of money ; I just care about the things I want to do . Inventions and mathematics and machines . MARTHA MINCH But if you do n't care about money they 'll always take it away from you . STEPHEN MINCH Maybe . But they ca n't take away the things I do . I do n't want to put money into Arlington 's business . I 'd rather you had some furniture  --  for our house . MARTHA MINCH You mean we could start out with  --  real silver , and real liren p. 96 STEPHEN MINCH Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will . She Sits up . And I 'll make an end to being afraid of it . You are the one , and you always have been . STEPHEN MINCH God knows you 're the one , and always will be . MARTHA MINCH And , Stephen , I have kept myself for you , just for you -- and I know people said I was a prude and a blue-stocking -- but now -- now it 's decided -- I could even go swimming with you.  - -  I would n't care if you saw me . I 'd be proud . STEPHEN MINCH Let 's go . Let 's slip away and go . MARTHA MINCH Stephen -- over and over again I have such a strange feeling -- did n't we sit here before , and say all these things ? STEPHEN MINCH Did we , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH Every word , just as we said it now . There is a sudden , dramatic darkness , as if a veil had been pulled over the sun . They look up . MARTHA MINCH It must be going to storm . Hanus was wishing it would rain . STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the day . p. 97 MARTHA MINCH As if somebody 'd cut off the lights . STEPHEN MINCH It must be Hanus , fixing the machine . He rises . MARTHA MINCH Now , darling , I know you think a lot of Hanus , but do n't get him mixed up with the Creator . It grows even darker , a frightening dark . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , Hanus must have got back to the shop . MARTHA MINCH He wo n't get wet , then , will he , even if we do ? Off to the right HALLLE can be heard callingHallie . Stevie ! Stevie ! Are n't you coming ? MARTHA MINCH It 's Hallie . Well , perhaps she can wait . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , it 's Hallie . He takes a step to the right . MARTHA MINCH What is it , Stephen ? I 'm frightened . What is this darkness ? STEPHEN MINCH I do n't want to go , Martha . I want to stay and say I love you . But I asked Hanus to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so terribly unhappy -- and I won't --  MARTHA MINCH Stephen ! STEPHEN MINCH Yes . p. 98 MARTHA MINCH What are you saying ? I love you , Stephen . STEPHEN MINCH It 'll be better . Better for both of us . HALLIE ARLINGTON OutsideStevie ! Stevie ! STEPHEN MINCH I'll -- I 'll have to go . That 's part of it . MARTHA MINCH Part of what , Stephen ? Your face is hidden , and I 'm frightened ! STEPHEN MINCH You 'll know , Martha . You 'll know when it happens . HALLIE ARLINGTON OutsideStevie ! STEPHEN MINCH Yes , I 'm coming . He goes out to the right . The lights go out entirely . MARTHA MINCH From the darknessStephen , darling -- Stephen ! CURTAIN p. 99 Act 2 , Scene 4 ACT TWO : SCENE IV SCENE : While the stage is still in darkness HALLIE can be heard calling sharply . HALLIE ARLINGTON Quick , somebody ! Hurry ! He does n't come up , and I think he 's drowning ! Hanus ! Please , Hanus ! Where are you ? HANUS WICKS Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the bank ! HANUS WICKS Get out of the way ! There is a pause . HALLIE ARLINGTON Oh , I 'll never forgive myself ! Never ! HANUS WICKS Will you shut up ?  - -  You 'll be all right , Steve . You 'll be all right . You 've got to be . The lights come up gradually and STEVE is seen standing alone , feeling his way blindly . STEPHEN MINCH Where am I , then ? The river was just beyond ; I was going toward it , and I seemed to fall and stepped into cloud . This is nowhere , I 'd say , nowhere at all . The circle of light extends a little , and an OLD WOMAN is seen to be kneeling with her back to him . If it 's someone I know I could ask where I am . I know who it is . It 's Angela . No , it could n't be Angela --  it 's the herb woman . She told fortunes too . She used to spend the summer pulling ginseng for her witches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd find her . Can you tell me where we are ? I 'm lost here . You must know the path to town . The OLD WOMAN shifts on her knees and looks up at him . Her face is like Angela 's . She turns away again . That time the boys threw stones and one of them cut your face , I was n't there . I never threw at you -- I tried to stop it When I was with them . She turns toward him again . Once when I was sick you brought your kettle and brewed medicine over the fire ,  - -  and then you sat with me all night -- and I 'd have died , my mother said , only for you . Do n't you remember ? p. 100 THE HERB WOMAN ChucklingHuh , huh ! You were a pretty boy . Oh , you were a goner , if it had n't been for me and my old basket , eh , a goner . She peers at him .

Nothing will do but picnics when we 're young ; picnics and boys and girls . Ribbons and trousers , that 's what it is . STEPHEN MINCH Well , keep it to yourself . I 'll find it alone . THE HERB WOMAN So hot , my little man ? Aye , you 'll follow a ribbon far enough , back through the stars , and forward through your time till you come back to the land 's end . When you have one you must have t' other . When you have t' other to kiss she 's not the one . STEPHEN MINCH How do you know ? THE HERB WOMAN But bide and wait , your own will come to you .

What have you wished now ? STEPHEN MINCH Never mind what I wished . THE HERB WOMAN I can tell your fortune . STEPHEN MINCH I do n't want it . THE HERB WOMAN Give me your hand . STEPHEN MINCH Well , tell it . THE HERB WOMAN God , what a paw ! Would you wish to know the secret , why it is I can tell fortunes ? STEPHEN MINCH What is it ? THE HERB WOMAN There are no fortunes , good or bad . All fortunes are alike . Tell one and you 've told all .

THE HERB WOMAN Your destiny 's your shadow on your path , falling before you where you want to go . Where are you going now ? STEPHEN MINCH Back to find Hallie . Not that I want to , though . Only I have to . THE HERB WOMAN Then it 's your destiny , too much of it . Aye , you shall have your Hallie ; be wary what you wish for when you 're young for when you 're old you 'll get it .

THE HERB WOMAN There 's Hanus . Ask it of him . HANUS is seen standing in the rear . STEPHEN MINCH Hanus ? HANUS WICKS You 're all right , Stephen . You 'll be all right . p. 103 STEPHEN MINCH Where are they all ? HANUS WICKS Not far . I jammed the wagon , and the sky went so black I lost the path , but I got back in time . He points . Over this way . STEPHEN MINCH Why , sure , it 's easy . Where 's the old woman ? HANUS WICKS Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was out picking ginseng . HANUS WICKS I did n't see her . She has disappeared . STEPHEN MINCH She had me scared for a minute , gabbling about my fortune . " No place or time " and " It never happened " . The figures disappear . CURTAIN p. 104 Act 2 , Scene 5 ACT TWO : SCENE V SCENE : On the ledge . STEPHEN is lying face down over a rolled-up coat , HANUS bending over him . HALLIE runs in bare-foot , buttoning her dress , her hair down . STEPHEN 'S clothes are dripping from the water . The sun is still under a cloud . HANUS WICKS The water 's out of him . He 's coming to . He turns STEPHEN over . HALLIE ARLINGTON Is he going to live ? She stands at a little distance . HANUS WICKS Oh , shut up.  - -  Yes , he 'll live . HALLIE ARLINGTON I did n't mean to do it . HANUS WICKS You did it.  - -  Come here and hold his head up , will you ? HALLIE ARLINGTON ReluctantI 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dead , you crawfish , no thanks to you . HALLIE ARLINGTON All right . She kneels and takes STEPHEN 'S head on her knees . HANUS WICKS Do n't let go now . He takes a bottle from his pocket and forces a few drops into STEPHEN 'S mouth. p. 105 HALLIE ARLINGTON Oh , Hanus , do you carry liquor ? HANUS WICKS Shut up . HALLIE ARLINGTON He's -- he 's alive . STEPHEN MINCH Opening his eyesIs it Martha ? HALLIE ARLINGTON No , it 's me . It 's Hallie . STEPHEN MINCH Hallie ? Oh , yes , Down at the pool . I must have --  what happened to me ? HALLIE ARLINGTON You fell in -- I -- I pushed you backwards --  STEPHEN MINCH I must have hit my head on the rock --  HALLIE ARLINGTON I did n't mean to , Stephen.  - -  He 's going to be alive , Hanus !  - -  You did n't want to go swimming , and I thought if you were all wet you 'd have to . STEPHEN MINCH I certainly got -- all wet . Inside and out . HANUS gives him anothor drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WICKS Fire-water . STEPHEN MINCH Let me have the rest . I need it . He gulps down a long draught . That 's better , if it stays where I put it . He shivers . I 'm getting you all wet . p. 106 HALLIE ARLINGTON I hope nobody comes . STEPHEN MINCH Why ? HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'm a sight . Do n't look at me . STEPHEN MINCH You look fine . Anyway you 're warm . He snuggles his head back . HALLIE ARLINGTON Ooh -- you cold beast ! She puts her arms round him and brushes back his hair . Now I 'll have to marry you , wo n't I ? STEPHEN MINCH Why ? HALLIE ARLINGTON For what I did . STEPHEN MINCH Yeah , I guess so . HANUS WICKS You could n't do worse . HALLIE ARLINGTON Do you mean it , Stephen ? STEPHEN MINCH Sure . HALLIE ARLINGTON Oh , you darling . She leans down and kisses him . STEPHEN MINCH Do you mind ? I 've been drinking . HALLIE ARLINGTON I love it . She kisses him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 107 HALLIE ARLINGTON Will you bring me my shoes and stockings , Hanus ? HANUS WICKS Why not ? I always have to wait on his women . He goes out right . HALLIE ARLINGTON Why did you run away from me all day , Stevie ? STEPHEN MINCH I did n't . HALLIE ARLINGTON Yes , you did . It looks as if you had to be hit over the head before you could like me , does n't it ? STEPHEN MINCH Let 's make it the last time . HALLIE ARLINGTON All right . She seals her promise with a kiss . DUFFY looks in from the left along the ledge , and beckons to CHRISTABEL , who slips up behind him . She puts her fingers to her lips and they retreat . STEPHEN MINCH How did I get here ? HALLIE ARLINGTON Hanus carried you . STEPHEN MINCH Good old Hanus . He always rescues me . HALLIE ARLINGTON You mean he rescued you before ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes -- all the same . Only it was a different girl that time . HALLIE ARLINGTON What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . HALLIE ARLINGTON Maybe it will all come out the way papa said , Stevie . STEPHEN MINCH Maybe it will -- this time . HALLIE ARLINGTON Are n't you happy ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes . DUFFY and CHRISTABEL come back along the ledge , bringing OGLETHORPE and DELLA . DUFFY lifts his hand for a baton and they all sing . The Quartet I 'm dreaming now of Hallie ; Sweet Hallie , sweet Hallie ; I 'm dreaming now of Hallie , For the thought of her is one that never dies . HALLIE ARLINGTON I do n't know what you think 's so funny .

The laughter is suddenly hushed . HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'm glad if you think it 's amusing , because I do n't . I 've heard it too often . MRS . RUTLEDGE I shall remember this , Mr. Duffy . She passes the QUARTET and sees HALLIE and STEPHEN . So this is where you are . Within easy distance of my call , where you must have heard me . Hallie , have you been in swimming ?  - -  You have . HALLIE ARLINGTON What if I have ? HANUS enters with Hallie 's shoes and stockings ; also a chemise . CHARLES DUFFY He fell in and she pulled him out . STEVE sits up . MRS . RUTLEDGE Very likely .

STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneels beside him. p. 111 MARTHA MINCH Where did you go ? I looked for you everywhere . CHRISTABEL Did you know , Martha ? Stephen and Hallie are going to be married . MARTHA MINCH Stephen and -- Hallie ? CHRISTABEL Is n't it marvellous ? MARTHA MINCH Is it true , Stephen ? STEPHEN MINCH MiserableYes , Martha . MARTHA MINCH Was it all a mistake ? What we said ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes , Martha . MARTHA MINCH Yes , it's -- it 's marvellous.  --  She steps back . I must have sounded pretty tragic . She turns to Reiger . Here we come dashing to the rescue , and it's -- it 's a wedding announcement ! I hope you 'll be --  She turns away to hide her face. happy . HALLIE ARLINGTON You must n't mind too much , Martha . We were so much in love it just had to happen . MARTHA MINCH Oh , I can see that ! and I do n't mind at all . It makes everything so easy . She runs out . REIGER follows her. p. 112 MRS . RUTLEDGE And now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves more presentable -- please . The CHOIR starts out . Give me the shoes and stockings , Hanus , and the underthings . He does so . If you do n't mind , Hallie , we 'll find a covert where you may dress with some privacy . The CHOIR has made its way off stage . HALLIE ARLINGTON Yes , ma'am . She follows Mrs. RUTLEDGE out. @x SCENE : The drawing-room of Stephen Minch 's house , a smugly palatial affair , existing in the false future of his marriage with Hallie , say about 1937 . There 's a front door at the right , a rear door at the left , a staircase winding down from the upper floor , a grand piano and any amount of Middle Western pictures and furniture . A small man in a dress suit sits with his back to the audience , a full cocktail tray beside him , drinking alone . He finishes one glass , takes another and downs it . He rises and wanders to the piano , and is seen to be STEPHEN MINCH , an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts out a hand to the keys , glances upstairs and refrains . He has taken a third cocktail with him , and still carries it . HANUS , not so young as he was , comes down the stairs in his old clothes but wearing a stiff collar . HANUS WICKS I do n't know what the women do to a man to get him into one of them monkey-suits . Dress ' em up like so many movie ushers and drive ' em past a grand-stand full of butlers  --  in formation-every woman holding the reins on her own gelding . I could n't stand it , so I left home . Not much home to leave , with that anthem-croaking old prissie hiding my tobacco behind the toilet-seat , but what there was of it I left . Looks difficult before you do it , but after you do it you would n't go back for money . p. 115 STEPHEN MINCH Are you going to live here now , Hanus ? HANUS WICKS Am I invited ? STEPHEN MINCH Not by Hallie . Personally I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WICKS I never should have married her , Steve , never should have married anybody . STEPHEN MINCH We 're not eating at home tonight . You 'll have it all to yourself here . HANUS WICKS Then this comes off , and the butler can choke to death watching my Adam 's apple . He takes off his collar and tie , and pockets them . That butler of yours never should ' a ' gone through Harvard . Every time he looks at me he suffers concussion of the brain . STEPHEN MINCH Setting down his empty glass and risingThere 's something I want to tell you about , Hanus He pauses . HANUS WICKS I 'm waiting . I 'm all braced and waiting . STEPHEN MINCH You have n't got a chance , Hanus . You do n't give yourself a chance . HANUS WICKS What 's it about ? More about my clothes and general deportment ? You were n't born in one of those things yourself , you know . I 've seen you bare , and you 're human as I am . Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 116 STEPHEN MINCH Oh , the hell with it . HANUS WICKS What is it , Steve ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's no use . HANUS WICKS I 'd go quite a distance for you , Steve . Further'n you go for me probably . I 'll put the damn thing back on again . He reaches for his collar . STEPHEN MINCH No , that 's not it . It 's nothing . Nothing I can do . HANUS WICKS O.K. He helps himself to a cocktail . Humming-bird poison . Made up to tickle the women into sleeping with the wrong men . Hits ' em right between the legs . STEPHEN MINCH For Christ 's sake , turn off the record , will you , and stop bleeding around like a stuck pig ! Do you think I like the place any more than you do -- or the clothes I wear , or the company I keep ? I have n't been in the laboratory for ten years ! I 've done nothing but sit in an office figuring out how to out-smart somebody out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it tougher for me ! I 've been trying to make it easier for you ! I 've been trying to warn you to fit in and play the game , but if you wo n't learn you wo n't ! HANUS WICKS Maybe I 'm too dumb to learn . HALLIE , growing old hysterically , descends the stairs in evening dress , and crosses to the cocktail tray. p. 117 HALLIE ARLINGTON To STEPHENWhen we 're having guests for cocktails you might at least wait till the guests arrive . HANUS WICKS Jeez , I thought I was a guest . HALLIE ARLINGTON As for Hanus , his dinner 's ready , and he may as well eat it now . She eyes HANUS with distaste . HANUS WICKS You do n't want me out of the room any faster'n I want to go . He goes out into the dining-room . HALLIE ARLINGTON This ca n't go on , you know . STEPHEN MINCH What ? HALLIE ARLINGTON Hanus staying here . STEPHEN MINCH I never said it could . HALLIE ARLINGTON But he 's here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His room 's a sty , he never changes his clothes , he insults me every time I see him , and he takes it for granted he has as much right in this house as I have ! STEPHEN MINCH When it comes to value received , maybe he has . HALLIE ARLINGTON And what does that mean ? STEPHEN MINCH Anything you like . p. 118 HALLIE ARLINGTON You 've been drinking . STEPHEN MINCH You 'll be drinking , yourself , in a couple of minutes . HALLIE ARLINGTON That 's cheap . STEPHEN MINCH We 're all cheap . The whole gang of us , except maybe Hanus . HALLIE ARLINGTON Well , I warn you , I wo n't put up with Hanus much longer . STEPHEN MINCH I guess you wo n't have to put up with him much longer . HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'm glad to hear it .  --  I forgot to tell you  --  you wo n't have to bring me home from the Melton dinner . Mr. Duffy 's going to be there . STEPHEN MINCH If you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . It makes the neighbors talk to see you coming home in a dinner dress around noon . HALLIE ARLINGTON I have a perfect right to sleep at the club . STEPHEN MINCH So has my old pal Charley Duffy . And you have a perfect right , under the Constitution , to be a tramp . HALLIE ARLINGTON I 'm not a tramp , but if I can find a little consideration and a little feeling for beauty away from home I shall take it . p. 119 STEPHEN MINCH That 's what I said . If you can find a little consideration and a little feeling for beauty away from home you have a right to go after it . And when it comes to Charley , he certainly goes around feeling for beauty , right and left . HALLIE ARLINGTON I do n't know why I live with you ! STEPHEN MINCH You don't.  --  But I can tell you why you do n't divorce me . HALLIE ARLINGTON I 've wondered for a long while . STEPHEN MINCH Because you 're afraid the alimony might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry you any more than I 'd do it again myself . HALLIE ARLINGTON Maybe I know more about that than you do . STEPHEN MINCH I hope you do . The door-bell rings and DUFFY 'S voice is heard in the hall . Duffy . OutsideOh , walk in , folks . Enter the palace of Stephen Minch and behold our guzzling host with his fair consort ! DUFFY enters , followed by REIGER and MARTHA , dressed for dinner . They are , of course , older , except for DUFFY , who is much as before . What , no butler ! He poses as one . Mr. and Mrs. Paul Reiger , of West Terrace , Reigerville , Ohio ! Mr. Charles Duffy , pirate , unattached , slightly squiffed , but able to drive ! Sorry to be late , Hallie , but the triffic was teraffic as they say in New York . God , are n't you beautiful ? How do you like my new tails ? He revolves before her. p. 120 HALLIE ARLINGTON Gorgeous . CHARLES DUFFY Gim me a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN MINCH Hello , Paul . Hello , Martha . MARTHA MINCH Hello , Stephen . CHARLES DUFFY Where 's Hanus ? STEPHEN MINCH Eating his dinner . CHARLES DUFFY We 've got to get it over with tonight , you know . STEPHEN MINCH All right , get it over with . CHARLES DUFFY You girls go upstairs . HALLIE ARLINGTON I do n't know why . MARTHA MINCH Something disreputable , no doubt . HALLIE ARLINGTON What do I get to go upstairs ? CHARLES DUFFY Diamonds , darling  --  pearls and rubies . Also affection . HALLIE ARLINGTON If Hanus is being fired I want to watch . CHARLES DUFFY Well , he is . HALLIE ARLINGTON From what ? CHARLES DUFFY We turned over part of that holding company to him  --  you know , to avoid income tax  --  and now we 've got it all fixed to do a little merry-go-round with the stocks and he wo n't play ball . p. 121 HALLIE ARLINGTON You mean he wo n't turn over the stock ? But that 's dishonest ! CHARLES DUFFY I 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? CHARLES DUFFY We have n't got a majority without him . MARTHA MINCH It looks as if Master Hanus was in control of the situation . CHARLES DUFFY That 's what he thinks . HALLIE ARLINGTON Why is n't he ? CHARLES DUFFY Never mind why  --  only he is n't . PAUL REIGER I thought his old woman was coming over . CHARLES DUFFY She is . HALLIE ARLINGTON Coming here ? Now Charley ! MARTHA turns to the book-case and takes down a book . CHARLES DUFFY Had to be done . She ought to be here now . Call him in , will you , Steve ? STEPHEN goes into the dining-room . HALLIE ARLINGTON You were pretty silly to trust Hanus . PAUL REIGER He 's no thief , you know  --  just a plain fool . STEPHEN and HANUS come in from the dining-room , HANUS carrying his napkin. p. 122 CHARLES DUFFY Now listen , Hanus . We 're asking you to do only one thing  --  and that 's to vote your stock for the reorganization . That 's all we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to put the napkin in his pocket , discovers his collar and tie , and thrusts them all in together . PAUL REIGER What 's in the other pocket ? Rabbits ? HANUS WICKS You do n't get it . CHARLES DUFFY Then I 'll tell you what we 're going to do . You 're crazy , and you 've been crazy ever since I first saw you . We 're going to have you declared crazy , have you put away and let your wife vote the stock for you . HANUS WICKS You ca n't do it . CHARLES DUFFY The alienation officer says I can . He 's outside waiting . There 's a ring at the door . That 's your wife now . STEPHEN goes to the door and brings in the woman we remember as Mrs. RUTLEDGE , now only a little older , it seems , than the others . STEPHEN MINCH Come in , Mrs. Wicks . Hanus is here . She comes slowly forward . MRS . RUTLEDGE Oh , Hanus , you 've been cruel leaving without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 123 CHARLES DUFFY He 's crazy . MRS . RUTLEDGE Yes , I think he is . I honestly think he is . CHARLES DUFFY Would you swear to it ? MRS . RUTLEDGE Oh , I 'd have to , would n't I ? Does n't it seem as if I 'd have to ? CHARLES DUFFY If you want the stock in your name you 'd have to . MRS . RUTLEDGE Yes , indeed I think I would . HANUS WICKS Look , Charlie , I do n't mind cheating the government . That 's what you put the stock in my name for , and nobody minds that . But when it comes to wrecking the holding company to clean out the investors and swipe the whole kit and kaboodle for yourselves , I ca n't figure it . It 's a dirty steal of twenty million dollars from people that ca n't afford it , and I 'm not voting . CHARLES DUFFY Here 's something you might consider . You can keep the stock . Take it as a gift . Only vote our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Why are you so hot about reorganizing ? You do n't need that twenty million . PAUL REIGER As a matter of fact , we do , Hanus . We pooled our assets in the new company , and we 'll come out plucked if it does n't go through . p. 124 HANUS WICKS Maybe you 'd be better off without so much money . CHARLES DUFFY We 'll get it anyway , you know . Only one way 'll be unpleasant for you , and the other you 'll be on easy street . HANUS WICKS You ca n't do anything to me . CHARLES DUFFY Why not ? HANUS WICKS Because Steve wo n't let you . CHARLES DUFFY Oh , wo n't he ? HANUS WICKS No , he wo n't . CHARLES DUFFY I think he will . Steve ? STEPHEN MINCH As a matter of fact , I wo n't ! You can all get the hell out of here ! All of you ! And take your five cent alienist with you ! CHARLES DUFFY How will you look when I begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat as Hanus , I should judge . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , it 's me now . I 'm tagged . He walks across to the piano , sits down as if to play , strikes one violent chord , then turns to HANUS . STEPHEN MINCH Vote your stock for them , Hanus . HANUS WICKS I ca n't do it , Steve . STEPHEN MINCH I say vote your stock for ' em , the crooks ! p. 125 HANUS WICKS Well , I wo n't . STEPHEN MINCH Oh , you wo n't ! He leaps up . Then you can go sit in a padded cell for a while ! I wash my hands of you ! Maybe you think you 're a little tin Jesus being crucified  --  all right , be a tin Jesus and get yourself crucified !  --  What difference does it make ? The world 's made up of crooks and thieves , and if you want to do business and eat regular meals you have to be one of them ! We ca n't afford to lose all we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stenographer ! You can vote the stock the way they want it or else ! For all I know you are crazy ! I know I am ! MARTHA MINCH Stephen  --  you 'd put Hanus away ? STEPHEN MINCH I 'm doing it . HANUS sits . CHARLES DUFFY To HANUSWell , say something . We 're going to dinner with the tin-plate king and his collection of Titians , whatever that is . PAUL REIGER Blondes , probably . CHARLES DUFFY Looking at his watchSo , say something . HANUS is silent . MARTHA MINCH With a book in her handsDid you ever read any Dryden , Paul ? p. 126 PAUL REIGER I heard of him in school . MARTHA MINCH Listen to this : All , all of a piece throughout:Thy chase had a beast in view ; Thy wars brought nothing about ; Thy lovers were all untrue . ' T is well an old age is out , And time to begin a new . PAUL REIGER Watching HANUS , not listeningIt rhymes . MARTHA MINCH Yes , it rhymes . HANUS WICKS All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handing him a paperSign the proxy then , and it 's all over . HANUS signs . STEPHEN plays a few wild chords on the piano . PAUL REIGER Are we going ? CHARLES DUFFY Come on , let 's get out of here . HALLIE ARLINGTON A very good idea . STEPHEN MINCH I 'm staying home . HALLIE ARLINGTON Very well . I 'll manage . PAUL REIGER Good night . But nobody answers him. p. 127 MARTHA MINCH You 're better than all of them , Hanus . Anyway , you believe in something . HANUS WICKS Looking upNot any more . They all go out , but MARTHA , HANUS and STEPHEN . MARTHA MINCH You 're changed , Stephen . You 're like the others , bitter and cruel . You 've never done anything like this before . STEPHEN MINCH What of it ? It had to be done . MARTHA MINCH I can remember a time when you 'd have lost everything , and never given it a thought , before you 'd betray Hanus . STEPHEN MINCH It 's Hanus ' funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's yours . Your  --  funeral . STEPHEN MINCH It all went wrong a long time ago , Martha  --  when I married Hallie and not you . But it 's done with and gone and there 's nothing to do now . I know what I am , and I do n't like it . I 'm not real . And you 're not real . We 're all a big sham  --  but there 's no changing it . Too much has gone under the bridge . MARTHA MINCH Why did you marry Hallie then ? STEPHEN MINCH Because you wanted me to . p. 128 MARTHA MINCH I never said so . STEPHEN MINCH Oh yes , you did . Yes , you did ! Do n't you remember ? Do n't you  --  no , you would n't ! Go on  --  go with the others ! They 're waiting for you  --  and it 's all too late ! Go on ! MARTHA goes out . After a pause STEPHEN makes up his mind and goes to HANUS . STEPHEN MINCH Now forget it . HANUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  HANUS WICKS HardYeah , you 're everything you can say . STEPHEN MINCH Because you 're my only friend , Hanus  --  except for Martha . You 're the only one I care about , or that cares about me . They 'd all cut my throat for a quarter of one per cent of almost anything . HANUS WICKS Well , you 'd do the same to me . STEPHEN MINCH Maybe I would  --  but  --  HANUS WICKS But what ? STEPHEN MINCH Hanus  --  where 's that machine we used to have ? HANUS WICKS Up in my room . STEPHEN MINCH What kind of shape 's it in ? p. 129 HANUS WICKS I do n't know . It 's just sitting there . It would n't work a couple of years ago when I tried it . STEPHEN MINCH You tried it ? HANUS WICKS Yeah . I got desperate . But it would n't work . STEPHEN MINCH We might be stuck here  --  forever . HANUS WICKS We are stuck . STEPHEN MINCH Let 's go tinker with it . It 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? STEPHEN MINCH Might as well be dead as here . HANUS WICKS Sure , let 's tinker with it . They clasp hands . CURTAIN p. 130 Act 3 , Scene 2 ACT THREE : SCENE II SCENE : The lights go up slowly , revealing the dining-room of Stephen 's cottage as in the first scene of the play . The table is set for breakfast again . In the corner at the left STEPHEN and HANUS have just let go of the Star-Wagon and are looking at the table . HANUS WICKS She 's set it for breakfast . How long have we been away ? STEPHEN MINCH Twenty-four hours . HANUS WICKS I do n't figure in hours any more . They do n't mean a thing . STEPHEN MINCH I still get hungry . HANUS WICKS No scrap-iron today . Maybe she ran out of scrap-iron . STEPHEN MINCH Maybe she remembered you did n't like it . HANUS WICKS Would she know about  --  all that  --  that happened ? STEPHEN MINCH I do n't know . She was there . HANUS WICKS Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm wearing . HANUS WICKS Might as well sit down . STEPHEN MINCH I do n't know where Martha is . We 've been gone all night , you know . p. 131 HANUS WICKS All night ? How do you mean ? STEPHEN MINCH From her point of view . It 's just a matter of the point of view , time is . He goes into the inner room . HANUS sits at the table . HANUS WICKS From my point of view it was thirty-five years . And do you know how long thirty-five years is , boy ? It comprises the entire Triassic period , including the Pleistocene , whatever that is . It goes back to before God made the earth , and all I can think of to want now is breakfast . MARTHA comes in from the street , wearing a hat and coat . MARTHA MINCH Oh , Hanus  --  where 's Stephen ? HANUS WICKS In there looking for you . MARTHA MINCH Oh . Is he all right ? HANUS WICKS He 's fine . STEPHEN re-enters . STEPHEN MINCH ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I  --  do you want breakfast ? STEPHEN MINCH I guess so . MARTHA MINCH It 's all ready . Where have you been ? STEPHEN MINCH When ? p. 132 MARTHA MINCH All night . STEPHEN is silent . Where were you , Hanus ? HANUS WICKS Why , I 'll tell you  --  some other time . MARTHA MINCH What 's that ? She looks at the Star-Wagon . STEPHEN MINCH We were  --  trying out a new machine . MARTHA MINCH I wish you 'd told me . STEPHEN MINCH We did n't know . MARTHA MINCH I 'll bring your breakfast . She goes into the kitchen . HANUS WICKS She does n't know . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , she does . HANUS WICKS Oh , my God ! STEPHEN MINCH What ? HANUS WICKS I 'm not married any more ! He jumps up . Yipee ! Yipee ! Yipee ! Give me something to break ! Give me my hat ! I want to jump on my hat ! You better hold me , Stephen , before I shy a plate through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's any cause for celebration you have n't told me about it ! I do n't know where you were last night or what you were doing , but whatever it was you left me sitting here all night without a word of explanation ! I suppose there were no telephones where you were  --  and surface transportation broke down all over the city ! I suppose you ca n't remember that yesterday was pay- day and you left me without a cent of money in the house  --  p. 133 STEPHEN MINCH SoftlyMartha . MARTHA MINCH What is it ? STEPHEN MINCH Did n't you sleep last night ? MARTHA MINCH No , I did n't sleep . I sat in the chair by the window . STEPHEN MINCH Did you want me to come back ? MARTHA MINCH I think you stayed away just to frighten me . STEPHEN MINCH Martha  --  did you ever read any of Dryden ? MARTHA goes slowly to the table and sets the pan down . Your wars brought nothing about ; Your lovers were all untrue.It 's well the old age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTHA MINCH Did you have the same dream ? STEPHEN MINCH Yes . MARTHA MINCH What does it mean ? STEPHEN MINCH It means I like it better here . And Martha  --  when you did n't like it  --  it was all my fault . There is a knock at the door . HANUS opens it and DUFFY enters . CHARLES DUFFY Good morning . p. 134 STEPHEN MINCH Good morning , Charley . CHARLES DUFFY Good morning , Martha . MARTHA MINCH Good morning . CHARLES DUFFY How are you , Hanus ? HANUS WICKS Did you speak to me ? CHARLES DUFFY I did  --  I said how are you ? HANUS WICKS I 'm fine . How are you , Charley ? CHARLES DUFFY Up a little earlier than I like , but able to get around . You boys have a way of getting me up early these days . STEPHEN MINCH We have ? CHARLES DUFFY Who else ? When you ca n't think of anything else to do you rob the plant . Oh , it 's all in the day 's work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed . MARTHA MINCH Who robbed what plant ? CHARLES DUFFY These boys . But it 's all right  --  a little matter between friends . As a matter of fact I was n't going to talk about that at all . I came over to make you an offer . MARTHA MINCH Tell me what happened , please . CHARLES DUFFY Well , the watchman called me up this morning to say there was a window forced in the laboratory last night and somebody 'd run a truck gangway out a window and made off with Steve 's contraption there . He looks at the Star-Wagon . Now I know pretty well who it was , and I did n't give a damn , but pretty soon it turned out there was something else missing . p. 135 HANUS WICKS That 's all we took . CHARLES DUFFY And now we can prove you took it , because there 's the contraption . If you took one you took the other . STEPHEN MINCH But that 's all we took . CHARLES DUFFY Think a minute . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time  --  that is , I did n't want anything else . CHARLES DUFFY Now , look , Stephen . After you left yesterday I had a little talk with Park and What's-his-name , the fellows who were going to take over the rubber . When I pinned them down it turned out they did n't know much about rubber , but they did know where you kept your analysis . They were all filed away in that little case on your window-sill . And we did n't have brains enough to put those cards away for safe-keeping . That filing case was empty this morning . We were slow in the head , Stephen , and you pulled a fast one . HANUS WICKS The burglar lifted them . CHARLES DUFFY What burglar ? I mean which burglar ? Because I happen to know who two of them are . STEPHEN and HANUS exchange glances . Now I need those cards . And I could put you boys in jail . Where are they ? p. 136 STEPHEN MINCH I do n't know . CHARLES DUFFY Give ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing said . STEPHEN MINCH We do n't know where they are . CHARLES DUFFY They 're no good to you , Stephen . If you keep ' em it 's only to get back at me . But it hurts you worse . STEPHEN MINCH They got lost  --  in the shuffle . CHARLES DUFFY Is that your last word ? STEPHEN MINCH I ca n't do anything about it . DUFFY claps on his hat and strides to the door , then turns on his heel . CHARLES DUFFY You 're smarter than I knew you were , Steve . It 's the first time I ever knew you to pull anything crooked , and I thought you did n't know how , but you win . It wo n't help me to put you in jail . I 've got to have the dope on that tire by tomorrow afternoon . And I do n't know where else I can get it . Are you coming back to the lab. or not ? STEPHEN MINCH We 're fired . CHARLES DUFFY Forget it . STEPHEN MINCH I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUFFY What is it ? p. 137 STEPHEN MINCH You would n't understand it , Charley . There 's a lot of things you would n't understand . And one of them is that I 'll never take orders any more . It 's not worth it . I might do you a favor if I liked you , but I wo n't be threatened and I wo n't take orders . CHARLES DUFFY What 's come over you ? STEPHEN MINCH I know now there 's no good or bad fortune . Fortunes are all alike . CHARLES DUFFY I can walk out this door and fetch you more bad fortune than you could shake a stick at . STEPHEN MINCH No , Charley , you could n't . And you do n't even know what I mean . CHARLES DUFFY Sitting down and taking off his hatI do n't know , Steve . Maybe you 're bluffing and maybe you 're not , but if you 're bluffing you ought to play poker . You 'd be good .  --  This is the way I 've run the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose and you ca n't keep him any other way I make him a partner . You should have been a partner long ago , only you did n't make any play for it . A partnership carries two hundred shares with an income of about seventeen thousand . What do you say ? STEPHEN MINCH Do I have to do it , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH No . He does n't want a partnership . p. 138 CHARLES DUFFY Martha ?  --  What is this , anyway ? MARTHA MINCH I do n't want him to have a partnership . I do n't want him to be like you or Reiger or any of the others . I want him the way he is . No matter how little we have to live on . CHARLES DUFFY It does n't hurt a man to be a partner . MARTHA MINCH I 've known it to .  --  CHARLES DUFFY How about a salary as consulting engineer , no regular hours , just to look in on us when we 're in a jam like this one ? STEPHEN MINCH But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . STEPHEN MINCH Would it be all right , Martha ? We could buy a piano then . MARTHA MINCH I do n't need a piano , Stephen . CHARLES DUFFY Say two hundred a week . And Hanus rates fifty . STEPHEN MINCH All right . To MarthaYou 're going to have one anyway . To DuffyAll right . CHARLES DUFFY God , you had me sweating there for a minute . He rises . You do n't dislike me , do you , Steve ? p. 139 STEPHEN MINCH No.  --  After all , you married Hallie . CHARLES DUFFY That 's right , you were sweet on Hallie yourself , were n't you ? STEPHEN MINCH But I got over it . CHARLES DUFFY Yeah , you got over it .  --  You  --  yeah , you got over it . He pauses , thinking . Sometime you might do a little more work on that string-of-beads , lines-of-light , time-like-a-canal idea , Stephen . There might be something in that . STEPHEN MINCH What makes you think so ? CHARLES DUFFY As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never mind . Funny thing about last night  --  well , never mind .  --  We 'll get along better now . STEPHEN MINCH Yes , we will , Charley . CHARLES DUFFY And I 'll get that rubber formula ? STEPHEN MINCH Do n't worry . CHARLES DUFFY I 'm leaving it to you . Good-bye . STEPHEN AND MARTHA Good-bye . CHARLES DUFFY So long , Hanus . HANUS WICKS So long , Charley . DUFFY goes out. p. 140 STEPHEN MINCH Is everything all right , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH Yes , Stephen . She comes over and sits beside him . HANUS WICKS Do you want me to live somewhere else ? MARTHA MINCH Do you still believe in Stephen ? HANUS WICKS Yes , I do , Martha . MARTHA MINCH Then I want you to live here . STEPHEN MINCH I guess you want us to tell you about  --  the machine . MARTHA MINCH That ? What is it ? STEPHEN MINCH It 's a sort of radio , for picking up  --  old programs . MARTHA MINCH Did n't I see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were young ? STEPHEN MINCH Did you ? Maybe . HANUS WICKS We call it the Star-Wagon  --  and it runs along on a thread of time , like a cash-basket on a wire . Anywhere . Let me show you . He goes to the machine . MARTHA MINCH You do n't need to , Hanus , not now . HANUS WICKS But just an easy one , like half an hour ago , before Duffy was here . He pushes the button . Nothing happens . p. 141 STEPHEN MINCH No ? He goes over to it . It 's set . It should work . Something 's gone wrong . HANUS WICKS But it did work , Martha . STEPHEN MINCH It 's hard to believe , is n't it ? MARTHA MINCH You do n't have to prove it to me . I know it 's true . I was there . STEPHEN MINCH Were you , Martha ? MARTHA MINCH Yes . I do n't know how . STEPHEN MINCH What do you remember ? MARTHA MINCH All of it . I liked the choir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  the way you wanted to be . STEPHEN MINCH No , Martha . If I 'm a great man then there are n't any great men . I found out that much . MARTHA MINCH But suppose you build more of these so people can go anywhere  --  back and forth  --  and it changes the whole world ? STEPHEN MINCH That 's another thing I found out , Martha . It would n't change the world . Nothing changes it . Every new thing we find just makes it more mysterious . And maybe more terrible . MARTHA MINCH But the people would change . p. 142 STEPHEN MINCH Do you think so ? I do n't . They 'd just take it for granted after a while , and they 'd be the same . All these new inventions come along , and we think the whole world will be different , but pretty soon they 're on the market for a dollar down and two dollars a week , and people go on living as usual . And the inventors are n't any wiser than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , and studied , and maybe I had a gift for mathematics and things like that . And finally I put my finger on something  --  partly by accident  --  and I saw through the veil  --  and there was something nobody 'd known about .  --  But I 'm not different . I 'm just a little man , like the rest , only more stupid about most things .  --  I looked through the veil and saw a mystery , and pretty soon everybody can look through and see it . But they wo n't know what it means , and I do n't . It 's a way of remembering better than we used to , and maybe that 'll make us a little wiser , maybe not . But I hope so . MARTHA MINCH It made me wiser . I do n't want to go back any more . And I do n't want to change anything . STEPHEN MINCH We were right all the time , were n't we ? MARTHA MINCH Yes . All the time .  --  Let 's not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's have a piano  --  and sing sometimes . p. 143 STEPHEN MINCH I do n't know whether I can any more . MARTHA MINCH It 'll all come back when I play for you . I know it will . She hums a little and moves her fingers on the table as if pressing the keys . STEPHEN sings very softly , then with more assurance as he proceeds . STEPHEN MINCH SingingThey stand , those walls of Zion , All jubilant with song , And bright with many a loved oneAnd all the angel throng . As STEPHEN sings , HANUS leans to pump the imaginary organ.
