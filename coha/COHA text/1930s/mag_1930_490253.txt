IN our morning mail comes a roundrobin letter from some poets . It is signed by Joseph Auslander , William Rose Benk , Witter Bynner , and other poets , and it asks us to subscribe to a Publication Fund . It says the fund will be a " valuable aid in encouraging poets and creating for them a sympathetic audience . " Since when have we favored creating a sympathetic audience for poets ? The devil take such an idea . Our poets are suffering from overly sympathetic audiences  --  what they need is a hard , bitter , hypercritical audience . The letter goes on to say that the fund would open up for poets avenues for publishing their work " without their being thwarted by the usual magazine limitations . " The devil take that idea too . Were poets not limited by space and periodicity and sour editors , were they not angered to the point of frenzy by rejection slips , there would arise in the land such a loud and uncontrolled drunken singing as would deafen us and sicken us . Poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow fat and soft , with their easy dactyls . Raise funds for poets ? Never . Discipline them , thwart them , pinch them hard , till in their extreme agony they sing mighty songs of blood and death and life . THE morning mail , incidentally , is a daily index of the mad comedy of these , our beloved times . Take a sample batch . After the letter urging us to pamper poets , we open one from a firm in Richmond , Virginia , announcing the formation of the Hama-Month Club . For nine dollars the firm would enroll us as a member and send us , every month , a native peanut-fed Virginia ham cooked and ready to serve . Presumably if one also belonged to a hook club , one might eat the ham while reading the hook . Next letter  --  an anonymous communication beginning " Good luck in Flanders Field " and instructing us to copy the entire contents three times and send it within twenty-four hours to three other people to whom we wished luck . The chain , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier . Well , it ends with us , we regret to say . And now a letter from our bank , concluding : " We shall be glad to introduce you to the officers of the Company at any time . " No , thank you . It took us two years to win recognition from the paying teller  --  what chance would we have with an officer ? So it goes  --  a letter from the S.P.C.A. sympathizing with us about Daisy 's arrest and seeking our support for new dog legislation ; a letter from Lambda Sigma Phi , a fraternity devoted to the interests of those seeking the companionship of a sweetheart ; a letter from a yacht club , and will we join ; a letter from a dentist appointing an hour for breaking ground on a root canal ; finally ( and this is where we ceased to go on ) a letter from the New York Life , reporting a conversation between their Mr. Kingsley and a Mr. and Mrs. Coolidge . OO UR campaign for small inoffensive N.- , taxicabs goes right on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider the rise to pomp and power of the present cabs . They used to he merely second-hand cars , slightly remodelled . Then Yellow began making real cabs and selling them to individuals and to companies . The own-your-own drivers bought them ( on the installment plan ) , partly to meet comp.etition and partly to satisfy their own desire for beauty and luxury . Then came the Luxor , the Paramount , all the others , dolled up with extra colored lights and fancy trimmings  --  products of the **30;595;TOOLONG period . A vicious circle began to be apparent  --  cabs getting grander and more expensive , taking up more space , as we said last week . The more space they took up , the more acute the taxi situation , and the grander they tried to he . The luxury faction controls the streets today , complicated by the fact that the cabs are so expensive to buy and operate that the drivers drive about ninety miles an hour to try and get out of debt . The solution , if there is any , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take up less room , and look less beautiful . OF course everybody read in the papers that the Circuit Court of Appeals had decided that Mary Ware Dennett 's sex pamphlet was not obscene . This struck us as too much intelligence for a Circuit Court of Appeals to be showing . Any right decision like that has a tendency to make the populace moody . There is no tonic in the world so good for the system as a wrong decision by a higher court . To get up in the morning and he able to make a sharp bitter remark about the Circuit Court of Appeals is the proper way to start the day . To open the paper and turn to one 's wife and say : " Look here , will you look at what the Circuit Court of Appeals has decided  --  they 're going to send Mrs. Dennett to jail ! What kind of a lousy country is this we live in ? " ? to say that is to get in good condition for a hard day at the office . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one morning last week , and discover that a higher court had made a good decision filled us with lassitude , and we had to go back to bed . The Green Pastures IT 'S not true that the negro actors in " The Green Pastures " were picked from Harlem night clubs . Most of them are professional actors with plenty of experience . An exception , however , is the man who plays the Lord , Richard B. Harrison . Of summers he has been a teacher in the Agricultural and Technical School at Greensboro , North Carolina , and of winters has been touring the country giving readings and recitations in schools and churches . He turned out to be pretty hard to direct , owing to his rather excellent English diction , with no trace of negro accent . He had to he coached in negro dialect by a white man who had played negro parts . Harrison is an octoroon , horn in London , Ontario . His parents were two former slaves who had escaped and met there . As a boy he worked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterwards he got into teaching and lecturing . He has a wife and two children in Chicago . The son conducts a jazz band , which he organized , and the daughter dances in a cabaret . He is actually several shades lighter in color than he appears in the part of the Lord  --  has to get blacked up . Another amateur in the cast is one of the angels . Mr. Connelly borrowed her from a friend 's house , where she was a maid . Most of the cast , which numbers ninety-Eve , have worked in the theatre before , however , many of them at the Howard negro theatre in Washington . Wesley Hill , the Gabriel in the show , played in " Porgy " and has been on the stage forty years . Daniel Haynes , the Adam , played in the talkie , " Hallelujah , " and understudied Jules Bledsoe in " Show Boat . " Several in the cast have other occupations besides acting . The man who plays Noah is New York correspondent for a Chicago newspaper , the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angels is a concert pianist , Haynes has a printing shop in Brooklyn . Mr. Connelly wrote much of the play on a boat going to and from New Orleans . He went there to visit Roark Bradford , author of the book from which the play is taken . Connelly himself is a native of Pittsburgh and never lived in the South . He finished the play one evening a year ago , typing the last page at 6 : 55 P.M. , and dashing off to dine with Jed Harris at seven and read the play to him . Harris turned it down because Connelly-insisted on directing it and Harris was afraid he would n't have much to say about how it was to he put on . The Theatre Guild next rejected it  --  afraid their suhscrihers would n't like to see the Lord on the stage . Arthur Hopkins read the script three times and liked the play but said he did n't see how it could he staged . Crosby Gaige said it was the funniest play he had ever read but that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from unimaginative Wall Street agreed to produce it , Rowland Stebbins . He had retired from a big brokerage house a year or two before and had produced two plays . He is the " Laurence Rivers " of the program . That name came from a favorite story he has read since boyhood , a ghost story called " The Gateless Barrier , " by Lucas Malet . Since the show opened no one has made any fuss about por-traying the Lord on the stage , but on the other hand approval h as come from many ministers . Harrison , playing that part , had misgivings , but they are gone . So far he has been cheer-ed by the audience after every perform-ance . Mr. Bradford , author of the stories upon which the play is based , is in Santa Fe , New Mexico , where he has been held ten months by the illness of his wife . Last Saturday night he read the play to the assembled patients in the sanatorium where she is confined . Musk Lacketh Charm T w  --  people told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany now , conductor at the Berlin State Opera , Herr Muck was rehearsing the orchestra one day when something went wrong , sadly wrong . With a violent gesture he brought all instruments to a stop and , waving his arms wildly , berated the offending musicians , calling the gods to witness that they were a bunch of leatherheads . After the outbreak he repented , and apologized . " I am sorry , " he said . " It 's because I love music so  --  I get carried away with it sometimes do n't know what I do  --  you must excuse me , gentlemen . " He then resumed the composition . A little later he noticed one of the violinists making strange little jerky movements with his how , and heard strange jerky little sounds . He held up his hand for silence and this time kept grim hold of his emotion . He addressed the offender in sorrow , not anger . " What is wrong , sir ? " he asked quietly . The fiddler gazed at him sadly . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I hate music . " Art ' vs . Law HE calm of one of the smaller 1 . art galleries in Fifth Avenue was broken not very long ago by the advent of a city marshal with a cigar , a derby , and an assistant . He startled the proprietor and a few people who were peering at faience figurines and Burmese sculptures by announcing that he had come to collect six hundred dollars in a court judgment rendered against the place . The owner stepped forward and moaned that he could not pay the amount at once , whereupon , with very little more ado , the marshal began tossing objets d'art into an old burlap sack , while his deputy made a list of the loot , " Madonna ' : an ' Child , " announced the marshal , after reading the label on a small bit of sculpture . " In de hag ! " intoned his deputy . " Head of Old Woman with Wimple , " sang the marshal . " In de bag ! " responded the assistant . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay two hundred dollars and give a note for the remainder , to be paid in a week . This caused the marshal to ponder . He looked about , puzzled , and finally ' picked on a gentleman who had been browsing around . " Hey , fella , " he said . " Should I take the offer or should I take the junk ? Personally , I would n't give twenty cents for the whole lot  --  would you ? " The gentleman thus accosted thought a moment , glanced at the perspiring proprietor , and said no , he would n't give twenty cents for the lot . This convinced the marshal . He took the cash and the note , and departed , and the art dealer silently shook hands with the stranger who had saved his shop for him . Disillusionment LlR recent little story about how NJ Miss Eva Le Gallienne got her citizenship papers in time to qualify for the Pictorial Review 's annual prize for being the outstanding American woman of the year was  --  er  --  over dramatized , it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Le Gailienne 's agents have called us up , lawyers  --  God forbid  --  have called us , and the Pictorial Review called in person . The fact is , Miss Le Gallienne did n't slip into court dressed as a beggar lady nor did Mrs. Moskowitz arrange with a court attendant to base the name mumbled . Miss Le Gallicnne went into court dressed as Miss Le Gallienne , although one witness is willing to swear that she did wear an unusually large and floppy hat . She was made a citizen on October 3 , 1927 . The award was made on October 28 , 1927 . She was handily under the wire and , anyhow , it was a pretty technical matter and nobody 's good faith was questioned . ThePictorial Review did n't have anything to do with it ; did n't know about it . Neither did Mrs. Moskowitz . Someone did telephone her but merely to ask a question . He wanted to know how much publicity would ordinarily attend a granting of citizenship to a person of prominence . Mrs. Moskowitz reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oddly enough , there was n't any when the time Caine . We 're sorry the subject ever came up . Subway Express A car of a downtown express was nearing Seventy-second Street from up Columbia University way when the passengers were startled by a large , militant woman who suddenly began to address the passengers at large . " I hope you people will excuse me , " she shouted , " but I have a room for rent in the Gerard Apartments on One Hundred and Sixteenth Street , near the campus . " Everybody was abashed but a gray-haired woman , seated across the aisle from the speaker . " I bin thinking of moving closer downtown from Washing-ton Heights , " she shouted , " and I 'd Eke to talk to you . " The two then got together to talk it over . When the train pulled into the Seventy-second Street station , a policeman , standing near the centre doors , who had taken in the little scene , spoke to a gentleman who brushed past him .

" Good Egg ONE thing that happens every Washington 's Birthday is the annual ball of the Egg Inspectors ' Union , No. 11,254 . It was held in Webster Hall this year and practically every prominent egg-candler in New York was there . ( An egg-candler is a man who holds an egg up to the light . ) Unless you get down around Chambers , Greenwich , Duane , and Jay Streets , you probably know very little about egg-candling . This magnifi-cently important work goes on in dark basements , one of which we visited the other day with Mr. Charles Siegel , busi-ness manager of the union . He took us to see candlers candling , and the spectacle was in-teresting . The place was pitch-black save for seven small gleaming eyes from seven candling lamps . Seven candlers , in ghostly white , stood at the Icing table , silently picking eggs nut of a crate , holding them to the edge of their lamp , and passing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shadows danced on the black walls , and the air was damp and cellarish . Eggs have to be candled  --  it 's a law . Formerly , candles were used . Now , electric lamps are used . The idea is the same . The lamp is a small black metal box , containing the bulb . In the front is a small hole , protruding , against which an egg fits snugly . The candlers separate the eggs into four divisions : Grade A , which are perfect eggs ; Grade B , which are eggs slightly shrunken inside ; Grade C , which are eggs very shrunken inside ; and unclassified eggs  --  water eggs , spot eggs , hatched eggs , sour eggs , lime eggs , grass eggs , rotten eggs . For doing this a candler gets either a minimum union wage of forty-five dollars a week or a piece rate of forty cents a case . A good candler , in a happy frame of mind , can inspect some ten thousand eggs in a day . Rotten eggs , to get right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe leather . The other kinds of unclassified eggs , unfit for regular consumption , are sold to bakeries for use in cake-making , and will anybody have a piece of cake ? Just as George Washington is the father of his country , so one Adolph Liebling is the father of the Egg Inspectors ' Union . He has spent his life in dark cellars , a patriarch of a silent , stoical tribe . Many of the candlers come from the Ukraine  --  a town called Wolochesck , which is the centre of the egg industry in Russia . One of the candlers showed us , pridefully , an egg with a double yolk . Once in a while a triple yolk turns up . Once in a lifetime ( and what a day it is in the life of an egg-candler ) along comes a four-yolker ! Crisis in Radio ACCURACY first , or nearly first , is the watchword of Radio . Liv-ing up to this ideal caused a tense few minutes at the National Broadcasting Company 's studio in Fifth Avenue a few days ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Builders , " which is a program sponsored by the Great Northern Railway . During the course of this tryout , with the time for actual broadcasting only fifteen minutes off , someone said he had never heard a train whistle like the one they were using . This whistling noise came from a phonograph record especially prepared by the railroad people and forwarded here . Such a doubt about the authen-ticity of the sound , arising with only twelve or thirteen minutes to go , un-manned a lot of the personnel , but the production manager , Mr. Knight , did not lose his head . He calm-ly reached for the telephone . He put in a rush call for St. Paul , Minnesota , and ap-pealed to the Great Northern officials who were assembling there listening to the final rehearsal over a special wire . " That train whistle , just as it goes into the tunnel was it right ? " Mr. Knight asked . " It seemed shrill and funny to us here . " " The whistle is right , " pronounced St. Paul , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular steam whistle . That is a work train , and it is hacking into the tunnel . When a work train backs into a tunnel that 's the way the whistle sounds . " This , of course , set everyone 's mind at ease . The program proceeded , while a platoon of property men removed a wide variety of apparatus which had been assembled around the microphone for possible use in the event that the whistle had n't been right . ?

Old Clothes WE wandered through Elizabeth Street one cold day recently and came on the old-clothes market , a melancholy and unsavory Hoek just west of the Bowery .

Here , as in every business , there are specialists  --  men who deal only in hats , men who deal only in shoes , pawnbrokers , wholesalers , retailers , exporters . Suits that are fairly
