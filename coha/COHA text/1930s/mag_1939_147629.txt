THE WITCH IN THE WOOD-T . H. White-Putnam ( $2.50 ) . <P> This book is a sequel to The Sword in the Stone , shows faintbrained , sweet-natured King Arthur confronted with the first problems of his position : how , with horn-rimmed Merlyn 's help , to defeat rebellious kings ; how to enlist Might in the cause of Right . Half-fantasy , half-burlesque , like its predecessor it mixes wisecracks and Morte d'Arthur , scrambles legend and topical satire . While her husband King Lot is away fighting Arthur , Queen Morgause , comic symbol of the egocentric wife , attempts the seduction of lovesick King Pellinore ( 3.2 Don Quixote ) and Sir Grummore Grummursum ( Sancho Panza on rye ) . Meanwhile her neglected sons Gawaine , Agravaine , Gaheris and Gareth confound their Saracen tutor Palomides , who talks rather like Charlie Chan , and beg stories from heretic St. Torealvac ( parody brogue ) , who inhabits a beehive and drinks mountain dew . <P> T. H. White 's well-timed , wild dialogues are suggestive of the better ( not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogies make the book " profound , " in the publisher 's opinion , as well as " funny . " There is an ice carnival , a burlesque of chivalry complete with pratt falls ; there is an affecting and terrible sequence , in somewhat doubtful taste , about a unicorn . The book as a whole might be described as a shake-up of British rectory humor , Evelyn Waugh , Laurel &; Hardy , John Erskine , and the Marquis de Sade , quite well enough blended to please the palate of Sword-in-the-Stone partisans , to assure its author definite standing among such cult men as A. P. Herbert , P. G. Wodehouse , Lewis Carroll .
