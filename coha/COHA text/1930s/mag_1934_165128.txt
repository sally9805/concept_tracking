If Frank Finley Merriam had stayed in Iowa where he was born 68 years ago he would have been spared a lot of trouble last week . He taught school , published a newspaper , gravitated from the Midwest to Long Beach . Calif. , became a bank president , a realtor , a Knight of Pythias , a politician , and six weeks ago upon the death of James Rolph Jr. , Governor of California just in time to face the best brand of California dynamite-a strike . <P> It was not big bald Frank Merriam 's fault that strikes in California are not like strikes elsewhere in the U. S. The Pacific Coast is still generations closer to frontier days than any other part of the country . Its businessmen , not inoculated with the chronic malaria of labor trouble , see Red at every labor agitation . Some of them hate labor unions with the hate their trail-blazing fathers had for Indians on the warpath . And they do not flinch from rough &; tumble with their enemies . Labor , too , has still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lumber camps . <P> Under such conditions Washington 's polite formula of a three-man board to mediate a strike was not enough last week to avert several funerals in San Francisco . From early May , when 12,000 unionized longshoremen struck on the Pacific Coast , a grim state of siege has prevailed in all Pacific ports north of Los Angeles . <P> For a fortnight past Seattle and Portland shipping men had loaded and unloaded a handful of ships at a couple of docks under the menacing eyes of resentful strikers . In their ports close to 75 ocean ships lay helpless . At Los Angeles ' well-defended port , shippers were masters of the situation and kept cargoes moving about as usual . But in San Francisco hardly a vessel could load or unload . Scores of freighters had dumped their cargoes on the docks and sailed away in water ballast . Out in the Bay 89 deep-water ships swung idly at anchor . The Dollar Line had diverted all its trans-Pacific passenger traffic to Los Angeles and the Grace Line had eliminated sailings north to Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco 's five-mile Embarcadero ( see map ) had not opened for eight weeks to let a bale of silk , a bag of sugar or anything of the $50,000,000 worth of goods they held pass into commerce . When the first door opened last week , out surged something akin to War . <P> San Francisco 's Industrial Association had warned that it would open the port . The spot chosen for the attempt was Norton , Lilly 's Pier 38 , opposite the tough warehouse district which is known to oldsters as " South of the Slot . " - Freight cars on the Belt Line Railroad which runs the full length of the broad brick and cobblestoned Embarcadero and is owned and operated by the State were spotted to screen the pier while police cars lined up to keep an open runway . Out of Pier 38 thundered five trucks bearing packaged birdseed , coffee , automobile tires . Before sundown 28 truckloads had been moved safely to a nearby warehouse . Strikers , 3,000 strong , failed to stop the movement . Police fought them off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were broken , 26 men were injured , but the only trucks stopped were those of some non-combatants not plying to and from the docks .
