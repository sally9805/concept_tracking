txt Will New York Clean House ? To the Editor of The New York Times : The most substantial and inspiring phase of the present Mayoralty campaign was the forward note sounded in all of the speeches at the Fusion party rally in Madison Square Garden last night . Permanent change in the control of New York City 's government is the real issue in this campaign , but it has seemed to be overlooked until now . For six weeks we have been floundering in a welter of personal and factional conflict , of no concern to anybody except the politicians engaged in the fracas . The municipalities of this nation are tremendously interested in discovering if New York can clean house and set up a modern , honest system of government . If it can and does , other cities will take courage and follow . The nation is not concerned whether Curry or Farley rules Tammany , but it is mightily concerned in seeing the Tammany system overthrown in New York and every other city in America . The leaders of the Fusion movement now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of New York take new hope . BYRON R. NEWTON . Bayside , N. Y. , Nov. 3 , 1933.
