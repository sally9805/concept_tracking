txt Mary Lou ' Southard , 1430 Chicago avenue , Evanston , daughter of C. D. Southard , general manager of Butler Brothers , a general merchandise concern , came home last Friday to tell her parents she had been bitten by a dog at Dempster street and Chicago avenue . Mr. Southard made inquiries in the neighborhood , but failed to learn the name of the dog 's owner . Then he had handbills printed and distributed , in the neighborhood . The circulars asked the owner of the dog to realize that unless the animal was placed under observation ' the child I would have to receive antirabies1 serum . Yesterday his advertising brought results . Mrs. Elizabeth Herb , 2713 Walnut avenue , Evanston , saw one of the handbills and promptly called the Southard home , explaining she did not know the child had been ' bitten . She sent the dog to an animal shelter for ten days ' observation .
