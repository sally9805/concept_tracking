Amazed were greybeard fishermen of Hampstead and Wilmington , N. C. , last week , by the fatback ' " miracle " of nearby Topsail Inlet . The menhaden , or fatback , is a herring-like fish , not usually eaten but valuable for oil and manure . It grows to about 18 inches , feeds on microscopic sea life , breeds near shore in enormous shoals . <P> One day last week , fishermen put out in a small boat into Topsail Inlet , a cove varying in width from 1,300 yards to a mile , surrounded by flat , marshy , wind-raked country . Some distance offshore they came on a school of fatbacks so dense that their boat could make no headway . One fisherman plunged an oar into the writhing mass , and as far down as he could reach felt fish . The boat turned back . An onshore wind drove the fish , alive and dead , onto surrounding beaches , until fishermen estimated $300,000 worth had been killed . A. W. King , 65-year-old Hampstead native said : " They completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so thick they smothered each other to death . Folks carried off two truckloads of big sharks that were trapped in the run and smothered . "
