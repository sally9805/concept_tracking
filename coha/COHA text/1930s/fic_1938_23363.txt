THE DIAMOND-EATER A STORY BY GEORGE SHEPHERD ? Tou say you ca n't eat diamonds , but I that is n't so . Plenty of people are living on diamonds if you only knew it . Perhaps they have four or five , perhaps they have a handful , or maybe more . Quite a lot of diamonds do not take up a great deal of space . They are not hard to carry around and if you have to leave the country you can take them with you . If you do not want anyone to know you are taking them , you can tie them in a little sack around your middle , or something like that . Then when you get where you are going the diamonds are as good as money . Say you have five diamonds  --  maybe they are worth a thousand dollars apiece . Then you have five thousand dollars . Or maybe you have a hundred diamonds ; then they are worth a hundred thousand dollars . Or they might be worth more than a thousand dollars apiece , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe as much as five . It depends on the size and color and brilliancy and whether they are flawed . Personally , I do not care for the new flat-cut diamonds . They do not seem to have any color or brilliancy . If you turned the old rose diamonds under a light it was like looking at the colors in the rainbow one by one ; but the new ways of cutting them  --  you might as well be looking at a piece of glass . Well once I lived in a room in Greenwich Village . You know , one of those small rooms that was left over when theymade the house into apartments , up in the attic , with the roof sloping down , and you climb lots of stairs to get to them . You pay about four dollars a week for them generally , and some of the people who live in them have lived there for years . The landlady is very proud of how long her tenants have been with her , and when you come to look at the room she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a nice house it is and how easy she is to get along with ; but I wrote advertising copy once and I 'm on to a lot of slicker sales presentations than that , so I was n't impressed and , besides , when you get a look at most of the old tenants they look like such a bunch of dead-heads that nothing short of an earthquake could get them to move anywhere . They stay maybe twenty or twenty-five years . I wonder what becomes of them when they die . When I was living in that room I was always afraid of dying . I wondered who would take care of my corpse . My family lived a long way away and they did n't have any money to come and get me if I died , and the landlady did n't know who they were or where they lived , so I did n't know they would even hear about it . And the maid came in only twice a week , so I figured if I died Monday night she would n't find me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead with nobody knowing anything about it . And when they did , what would they do ? Who would look after me when I was dead ? I worried about that and I worried about being sick , because there was no telephone and no way of getting in touch with anyone if I got sick , and I knew I could lie there from Monday to Thursday with a fever of a hundred and six and delirious , maybe , before the maid would come in and find me . I did a lot of worrying . It is not a good idea to tell people you are worrying about what will happen to you if you die . They get an idea that you are morbid . The guy in the room next to mine was a worrier too , I found out after a while . You know how it can be in New York , you live right next to a guy for a long time and never speak to him and practically never see him . You come in and go out at different hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time you may never meet . There were only two of us on the floor , besides a little old maid who was a writer and spent all day typing , and used to scurry to the bathroom and back for fear of meeting this other guy or me in the hall . She was small and rather old and shy . And this other guy , it was the way I say , we 'd only nod or say hello , and I only knew what his name was from the mailbox downstairs . It was Paul Saranov . This went on for a few months and then one day I got back from work early . Generally I did n't get out of the office much before six , and I would hear Saranov go out a few minutes after I came in , if he was n't out already , and sometimes I would see him , and he would be wearing a top hat and tail coat . It looked funny . I do n't mean the clothes were funny . do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you did n't have to wear one to see that his was everything a top hat should be , and so were the tails . What was funny was seeing them on a guy that lived in a four-dollar-a-week room . So anyway , this night I got in early Saranov knocked at the door and asked could I tend him a razor blade ; he 'd run out . I lent him a blade and thought no more about it , but damned if he did n't knock on the door the next night and hand mea fresh blade all done up in the wax-paper they come in . Well , there he was , standing in the doorway in his undershirt . It was a silk undershirt , very good quality . And he was holding out this razor blade and looked sort of embarrassed about it . He was a good-looking guy , with fair skin and fair hair , probably older than he looked because blonds do n't show their age as much as brunets . He was n't awfully tall , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked as if they had n't been used much . So he was standing there smiling and holding out the blade , and I thought what the hell , and I asked him to come in . He said he would for a minute , and that 's how we got to be acquainted , and pretty soon we knew each other fairly well . Why I asked him in was , I thought here was someone who would look after me if I died or got sick . And when we had talked three or four times and were beginning to get the feel of each other and found out that we got on together  --  you know what I mean , we were telling each other what we really thought and not making conversation the way you do with someone you do n't care anything about  --  well , it was n't long before I told him I was afraid of dying and lying in my room dead for several days , and I asked him to sort of keep an eye on me and knock on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all right , even if he did n't have time to come in and talk . You can say things like that to Russians because they will not think you are morbid . They have a lot of ideas like that themselves . And I found out that Saranov was afraid of getting sick and dying too . I suppose really everyone is who lives alone in a four-dollar room where there is no telephone and the maid only comes twice a week and the family is a long way away . All of them are afraid of the same thing , I guess , except the ones that are hoping for it , and maybe the ones who are hoping for it are afraid too , or else they would do something about it themselves . So I told Saranov where to send a telegram to my family in case I died , and he told me he did n't have any family left , only one sister who ran a dress shop in Chicago , and I was to telegraph her , and that 's how I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very banal . It is the kind of a story all the Russians tell  --  if you know any Russians you will find it very boring  --  only in his case I think it was true because he had the diamonds . Not that I think it is n't true in other cases too , but it is the kind of story you would n't have to use any imagination to make up ; you can read it in lots of books and lots of Russians tell it wherever they go ; and I think perhaps some of them tell that story because they think it is expected of them . Russians are very obliging people , and also they like to dramatize themselves and are fond of holding audiences spellbound . Any-way , when Saranov told it I thought it was true in his case , and I will just briefly outline it because if I put in all he told me it would be as long as a novel , and there is a good chance you know it already . Saranov was a Russian nobleman , like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all seem to be Princes or at least Dukes . He was not very old when the Revolution broke out , sixteen or seventeen , so he was thirty-six or - seven when I knew him , and he was older than he looked , just as I thought . They killed his family and burned his house , and he escaped with the diamonds tied round his middle in a sack , just the way I said . He was in Paris for a while and then London and then New York , and he lived on the diamonds . His sister was in Italy when the Revolution happened and she did not have many diamonds , only the few she took with her to wear for jewelry on her trip , and they did not last long , so now she had the dress shop in Chicago . And Paul wanted me to telegraph her if he should die , and also send her the diamonds , because he wanted her to have them if he did not need them any more . He had no one else to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept the diamonds , he did n't trust me that much . Perhaps he was right . He told me if hedied I would just have to hunt and I would find them all right . He said it was a great relief to him to have told me about the diamonds because before that he had always worried about his sister getting them if he died ; he 'd been afraid some stranger might steal them or perhaps they might lie round for years and nobody find them . He said his friends did not know he called himself Paul Saranov , he was living under an assumed name for fear of the communists . I think the communists would have found him whatever he called himself if they wanted to , but he felt safer that way anyway . Russians are very innocent in some ways . So I said to Paul that it was a funny way to live , eating diamonds . Why did n't he find some kind of work and earn a salary ? He got sort of mad then . He said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were eating diamonds ; suppose your father died , he said , and all he left was ten thousand dollars insurance , your mother could n't live on the income , she would have to spend her principal , and that was the same thing as eating your diamonds . So I saw he was right , plenty of people are in a position like that , eating their diamonds . Then he said , why should he work ? It was not a tradition of the nobility to work ; some of the nobility had been forced into it , like his sister for instance , but he was n't forced to , so why should he ? It was bad enough living in a four-dollar room , he said , but he did n't have to give parties there , so it did n't make so much difference and he preferred it because the less he spent for a room the longer the diamonds would last . But a room like that was a very nasty thing for a man with his traditions . And also he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great social demand owing to his title and good looks and tails and top hat and silk undershirts ; he had more invitations to lunch and tea and dinner and dances and the opera and receptions and that kind of tripe than he could accept . Well , all that gave me a swift pain . But then he said , suppose I wanted a job where could I get it ? Bet-ter men than me ca n't get jobs . Suppose I did get one , I 'd be keeping some man out of it that needs it . I do n't need it . That would be injustice . I saw his point about that and I shut up about his getting a job . Paul and I were quite good friends by this time and both of us felt better about living where we did because we knew we had someone to take care of us if we died . That was a great bond between us . Paul was a funny fellow all right , he was good-looking and had a lot of what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrivel up into nobody at all . He would look like one of those old men in shabby clothes who limp along the sidewalk close to the building line , with very dead eyes and all bent over . I found out that these were the times when he was coming to the end of a diamond . Right after he cashed one he would have a lot of money , he would ride in taxicabs and tell me how he took some friends to dinner or gave a cocktail party in the Persian Room ; but when his cash began to run out he would economize and walk sometimes fifty or sixty blocks to a dinner he was asked to , and he would drink cups of coffee in dingy cafeterias when he had to feed himself , instead of buying himself a decent meal somewhere else . I think that was because he was stingy about his diamonds . He hated cashing them . But he said , " No , it is not parsimony , my friend ; it is the fear of death , every time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see death come that much nearer . " Well , I know about the fear of death too , I lived with it a long time before I knew Paul ; but I am only afraid of what may happen to my body after I die , and I can not see how such a strong man as Paul could be such a coward as to be afraid of the dying , and I believe he made up that excuse to hide his being stingy about his diamonds . One day after Paul had gone through quite a long period of shrivelling I came in from the office Tate and Paul came out of his room when he heard my key in the lock and he took me by the throat andsaid , " What have you done with them , you thief ? " , and I said , " Done with what ? " And he said the diamonds . " What is the matter with the diamonds ? " I asked , and he said they were gone . He thought I had taken them , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I told him I had never seen his diamonds , and I calmed him down and we searched his room again but we did n't find them ; and I asked if he always pulled down the shade when he got out a diamond , and he said no , he never pulled it down at all . So I took him to the window and showed him there was nothing to it . Our rooms were on the back of the house , and the back of an apartment building was right opposite , across the yards . I showed him that any one of ten or twelve windows would have a view of his room , and anyone who saw him with the diamonds could easily come down the fire escape at the back of the apartment building and climb the fire escape at the back of our house and easily get from there to Paul 's window ; to say nothing of it maybe having been the maid . So Paul complained to the landlady and reported to the police , and they questioned the maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating over at the apartment and I do n't know where-all , but they never did find where the diamonds had gone to . Paul could n't even tell them when they had been taken because he had been living on one for a long time and he only looked at them when he wanted to take one out . I told you Russians were innocent . Paul did not know what to do . He continued living in the room next to mine because he did not know where else to go . He stalled the landlady about the rent , but that could n't last forever , especially as she knew he had lost all those diamonds . He borrowed some money from me sometimes , and I suppose from his other friends also ; but it hurt his pride terribly , and besides he did not get much that way ; it was n't like a steady job that brings in a regular salary that you can rely on . He did n't go out so much any more , so he would come into my room more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reading the classified advertisements , and he would say , " I do not see any jobs here that I could apply for , what am I going to do ? I could become a taxicab driver , I suppose , but it would be very embarrassing if I were hailed by some of my friends coming out of the Opera or the Ritz . I should have to keep to the unfashionable parts of town . " So I said I did not know what he was going to do , it was a tough break all right , and he said , yes , it was . And it was too ; you can see it was . It really was tough on Paul . So I told Paul one night that my agency was moving me to the Denver branch and I should have to leave him ; and he said could n't I take him to Denver with rne , and I said , " How would you be any better off in Denver than you arc here ? " and he said he guessed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with you gone I shall be afraid of dying again . " " Well , yes , that is a terrible thing , " I said , " but perhaps someone else will take this room who will look after you if you die , and anyway you do n't have to worry about getting those diamonds to your sister . " And he said , " No , that is one thing I do not have to worry about ; you are right , it is a great comfort . " He laughed when he said that , but I do not think he thought it was really funny . Oh , by the way , I said , going to Denver I shall pass through Chicago and I can give your sister a message if you have any to send . " No , " he said , " I do not think I have . Perhaps I shall soon go to Chicago myself if I can raise the money , perhaps I could find some work to do in my sister 's shop , in the shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . It would be easier for me to do that kind of work in a city where I do not know anyone . " " Oh , " I said , " well , that is a good idea . " So here was Paul  --  in the first place he had never sent his sister any of those diamonds and now he was planning to go outand sponge on her instead of making a living , and I said to myself , that is one hell of a kind of a brother if I ever saw one . That is about the Iast time I saw Paul , I guess , because I left New York . I did not go to Denver though . I do not like cold climates or winter , so I came down here to Haiti instead , and now I have a little house of a sort which I hope will not blow away in the hurricanes . I have two servants , so I am not afraid of what will happen to me if I die . I did not like agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a writer , which I always wanted to be ; but writing does not pay a great deal even if you get your writings published , and mine do not seem to get published very often , so it probably is a lucky thing that I still have some of the diamonds left . Of course the trip down and buying the house and living here with servants took quite a lot of them , and there really were n't so many as I thought in the first place . And Haiti is not a good place to sell diamonds ; it makes you conspicuous . Every time I do it I am afraid perhaps they will get to talking about me and suspect something . I could escape into the jungle if I knew in time , but I do not want to run into the jungle . Perhaps I should have gone to a country where they do not have extradition . Perhaps I should move to one , but that would take still more diamonds . I do not know what I shall do when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and get a job again and get out of the office at six o'clock and live in a four-dollar room . I do not like that , nor getting up so early in the morning , nor being afraid of what will happen when I die . I do not know why the diamonds go so fast . I do not seem to be as good as Paul at economizing them . I do not like to shrivel into nobody the way he did . The trouble with eating diamonds is like eggs or lettuces or anything else : if you want to keep on doing it you have got to have a great many of them in the first instance , unless you know where you can get some more .
