Last week neat , genial Joseph H. Nuelle was elected president of Delaware &; Hudson Co. to take the place of untidy , scowling Leonor Loree , who retired a month ago . Mr. Loree had run Delaware &; Hudson since 1907 , same year that Joe Nuelle ( pronounced Nelly ) started work for New York , Ontario &; Western . While Mr. Loree was maneuvering Delaware &; Hudson into a national prominence not strictly deserved by its present 847 miles of trackage , Mr. Nuelle was persistently working his way up from assistant engineer to principal assistant engineer to engineer of maintenance of way to chief engineer to general manager to president in 1930 . <P> Meantime Mr. Loree had completed the coup of his life : D. &; H. had bought into the Wabash and Lehigh Valley lines for strategic reasons , and when ICC ordered it to sell ( Pennsylvania R. R. was only too happy to buy ) there was a profit of $20,700,000 . In 1932 Mr. Nuelle 's O. &; W. , familiarly known on the Stock Exchange as the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I roads ( among which D. &; H. was not included ) making money . Then Mr. Loree made the blunder of his life : He used part of the Wabash and Lehigh Valley profits to buy 495,000 shares ( 10% ) of New York Central . He bought at $22 and held it . It reached $55 a year ago , is now $13-and there are convincing rumors that D. &; H. is taking its loss and selling . <P> Things are not so good for the Old Woman either . Last year Joe Nuelle left her to become president of Lehigh Coal &; Navigation Co. and shortly afterward , she filed under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act . There is another rumor around the Stock Exchange and roundhouses : She may be divided up piece by piece among other Eastern roads , and a large piece will go to Delaware &; Hudson .
