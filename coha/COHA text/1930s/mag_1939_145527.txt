Last week dumpy , soft-looking little Emperor Hirohito sampled the warfare on which his soldiers in China are fed . For breakfast he and his wife squatted before a low table on which rested a bowl of boiled rice and barley , and side dishes of powdered bean paste and pickled radishes . At lunch the menu read : millet gruel , side dishes of bean noodles , pork , boiled spinach and salty pickled plums . That evening the Emperor and Empress dined on boiled rice and barley again , had side dishes of dried fish , carrots and boiled lotus roots . One day of warfare was enough for the Son of Heaven . To date his army and people have had a year and half of warfare and are growing a little tired of it .
