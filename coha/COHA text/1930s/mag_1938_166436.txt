DEATH ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN-Louis-Ferdinand Celine - Little , Brown ( $2-75 ) . <P> " In the course of my life , " Celine once confessed , " I spent so many years as a bard , a hero , an official , and a doormat in the service of so many thousands of madmen that my memories alone would fill a whole insane asylum . " Readers of Journey to the End of the Night , which at 40 turned Celine ( real name : Louis Des-touches ) from an obscure municipal doctor to the most sensational of contemporary writers , may have thought that savage autobiographical novel was enough to fill a whole insane asylum by itself . But the Journey had left untold the story of Celine 's childhood and adolescence . <P> Death on the Installment Plan fills in the nightmare to his 20th year . It provoked less excitement in Paris literary circles than either his Journey , which started riots when it lost the 1932 Goncourt Prize , or his anti-Semitic " exercise , " Trifles for a Massacre ( TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death on the Installment Plan was merely expurgated and called the work of a communist , an anarchist and a maniac . As the U. S. edition follows the French , most readers ' imaginations are probably not strong enough to figure out what French publishers expurgated . English publishers threw out plenty . <P> The opening 36 pages consist of slum vignettes , gangrenous clinical talk and last-ditch confessions derived from Celine 's medical practice in a Paris charity clinic . ( He still clings to this job , which pays about $60 a month , although he has salted away some $25,000 in royalties . ) These pages give readers a sickening jolt . But Celine 's purpose is apparently to show that neither Ferdinand ( his autobiographical main character ) nor the world has improved since his boyhood . <P> Ferdinand 's earliest memories are only slightly less poisonous than his later ones . Son of an insurance clerk ( ' ' a drivelling great ape , with his head full only of fury , pretences and louder and louder yellings : a whole clattering chaos of idiocies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs a dilapidated antique shop , Ferdinand recalls malicious neighborhood gossip , scandals , a murder , a tough playmate who taught him much smut , another playmate who went to the country and died of fresh air . But these are among his lighter reminiscences . Most haunting memory is of his father accusing him of monstrous vices , and , because his trousers were usually dirty , predicting " a dung-coloured future in store for me . " <P> When , after his shuddering seduction by his boss 's wife , he is falsely accused of robbery , his family sends him to a private school in England . During his eight months there , he refuses to say a word-his comment on human trustworthiness . His only companion is a cretin who tries to swallow the silverware , drinks ink , knows only two sentences : " Do n't worry " and " Right as rain . " The night Ferdinand is leaving he is frenziedly seduced by the headmaster 's wife , who then jumps in the harbor .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
