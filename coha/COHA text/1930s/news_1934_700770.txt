" Mr. Hodson declared that before the end of the year the number of families that will have received relief would be increased to about 500,000 , made up of some 2,000,000 persons . The latter figure represents a population greater than that of any other American city with the single exception of Chicago , Mr. Hodson pointed out . " More and more people seem to come to the absolute end of their resources with each new month , " Mr. Hodson said after detailing the various forms of relief now being dispensed by the city .

" The Welfare Commissioner said in explanation of his report that he wished to acquaint fully every citizen of the city with what was being done to meet the growing relief needs of the unemployed and other dependents , Mayor LaGuardia 's plan for partly financing relief by a one-half of 1 per cent tax on gross volume of business " makes the relief program of the city more than ever , and properly so , the direct concern of every person in the city , and makes every person with an income a partner in the city 's unprecedented task of providing the bare necessities of life to the destitute unemployed , " Mr. Hodson said . Events Moved Rapidly . " The newspapers of New York City have been most enterprising and helpful in keeping the people informed of many aspects of the relief situation , " he continued . " Since Jan. 1 , however , things have moved so rapidly ; the whole relief problem and the methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city administrations have been so different than in previous years , and we have all been so engrossed in doing our best in a very bad situation that we probably have neglected to keep the community ? the partners in this enterprise  --  sufficiently informed of the state of affairs . " " We are repeatedly confronted with evidence that relatively few citizens have any real appreciation of the extent to which the City of New York is now meeting its relief obligations to the unemployed , of the vast scope of this undertaking and of the complexities and difficulties of the job . " We are , accordingly , issuing a detailed summary of the city 's emergency and normal relief activities during the first six months of this year and a projection of the city 's probable expenditures for relief during the balance of the year .

The expenditures for unemployment relief for the last six months will be $107,100,000 , with an additional $13,553,000 for other relief work . City 's Daily Disbursements . Mr. Hodson 's report showed that " on the average the city is now disbursing $550,684.93 a day , 365 days a year , or V% 945.20 an hour twentyfour hours a day , or $382.42 a minute , or $6.37 a second , every time the clocks tick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of this $6.37 about $1.60 represents the actual expense to the city and the balance of $4.77 is provided by the State and Federal relief administrations . " The relief load of the city has grown to these tremendous proportions , " Commissioner Hodson said , " despite the utmost care that is being taken in the investigation of applicants for relief at the time of their first application and at intervals throughout the granting of aid either in the form of home relief or work relief . Some relatively few , but vociferous , individuals and groups have been resentful of these investigations , but the administration is confident that the community as a whole approves of this effort to safeguard relief funds and to insure their use where the need is greatest .

" Summary of Relief Work . From the records for August Mr. Hodson summarized the present relief activities of the city as follows : 190,000 families are being assisted through home relief , the amount spent on each family varying from $5 to more than $150 during the month , depending on the minimum needs of the family and the extent of their own resources for meeting those needs ; the average aid to homerelief families is close to $40 a month . 125,000 persons , most of them heads of families , are being assisted through emergency work wages paid to them through the Works Division of the Department of Public Welfare . These , wages average $60 per month per person ; almost every trade , profession and occupation is represented among these 125,000 emergency workers who are engaged on 2,500 projects , all of a noncommercial nature and all designed to produce constructive and necessary results which , however , would not otherwise have been possible because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared for in boarding homes and institutions at the expense of the Department of Public Welfare . 19,000 other dependent children are being cared for in their own homes through grants from the Board of Child Welfare to their widowed or abandoned mothers . 9,000 homeless men and women were given food and lodging during the month of August . 22,500 aged persons are being assisted in their own homes through grants under the Old Age Security Act . 2,900 families of veterans are being assisted in the normal relief activities of the department , in addition to the 10,000 veterans ' families included among those receiving home relief . 800,000 free lunches were provided for children at the public schools . And ? 7,500 families under home-relief care received free medical and nursing service from , neighborhood doctors . and visiting , nurses paid by the Department of Public Welfare . " This , it should be remembered , is the picture of New York City 's relief activities during just one month , " Mr. Hodson said , " and the picture does not change greatly from month to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the absolute end of their resources with each new month . " The expenditures from Jan. 1 to July 1 for emergency relief and normal relief activities were itemized by Mr. Hodson as follows : Emergency Relief Activities .

" Aside from the growth in the . volume of relief , three facts are signifiCarit , - particularlyi when present emergency relief activities are compared to those of previous city administrations , " Mr. Hodson said . " First , home relief is being rendered to destitute families more promptly , with greater regularity , with more consideration for the varying needs of different families , and with more courtesy ; second , work relief projects are of a more constructive nature and workers are chosen with greater consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , the amount of relief per family is , we recognize , still inadequate in many cases . Every effort is being made to distribute available funds in the most equitable way possible , to recover relief funds illegally secured in the past by persons not actually in need , and to guard against further payment of relief funds or emergency work wages to persons not actually in need or not willing or able to do the work for which they are hired . " Discussing expenditures for the second half of the calendar year , Mr. Hodson said : " We shall be fortunate If the need for relief during the coming Winter is no greater than it is at present . On this conservative assumption , we should need for emergency relief purposes during the last six months of this year six times the amount spent during the month of June ( $17,850,000 ) or $107,100,000 and for the normal relief activities an amount equal to that spent for these purposes during the first six months of this year , $13,553,000 . This would bring the total emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $201,527,000 . This is , of course , a round . figure estimate . " Work Relief for Home Relief . He again emphasized a principle to which he had alluded often in the past ; namely , the desirability of substituting work relief for home relief . " I would be delighted , " the Commissioner said , " if it were possible to abolish home relief - altogether and to provide every able-bodied needy person in the city with a work relief job , preferably the job he is best qualified to do . This is not only the cheapest way of rendering relief , but from every point of view the soundest and the most humane . It would maintain the self-respect of the men and women who want to work for what they get and it would give the city permanent benefits in the construction of streets , sewers , parks , playgrounds and other needed improvements . " However , unless we are able to secure substantially larger appropriations from State and Federal sources it will be impossible to increase work relief rolls . " I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in entire agreement with the idea of giving people work rather than cash relief . The administration of New York City will be glad to cooperate with Mr. Hopkins in furthering this policy if the Federal Government helps us through increased relief funds .
