txt Snow that fell for more than thirty-six hours and was swept b3 a brisk nor'easter into deep drifts ' in rural and suburban areas blanketed the northern part of the nation yesterday . New York , already encumbered with piles of packed snow and glazed and rutted ice from last week 's storm , was buried under more than nine inches of fine pow. dery flakes . Many Long Island come munities and a few New Jersey , towns , notably Cape May , were isolated . Transportation lines were again delayed , planes ' were grounded and shipping blinded . The Long Island Railroad 's corn . muting trains were operated on a more and more haphazard schedule throughout the day , as the snow commenced to bank up above the third rails . Last night , during the rush hour , service was completely , disrupted . Later , delays were re . duced and for this morning 's rush hour " a clear line , subject to weather conditions , " was promised . No Coal for Relief . The threat of a coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was revealed when 8,000 families that have been receiving coal at police stations were told that there was no coal available , as the come panies making the deliveries had been tied up by the storm . This same situation was reported from various communities in Long Island and New Jersey and fuel was said to be running low in some cases . Commissioner William Hodson of the Department of Public Welfare said that the coal shortage might soon become serious , particularly , for those dependent on the city for relief , unless the weather relented and coal soon became available , He said that because of the weather no coal was being brought into the city . " It freezes in trains and barges , and the barges , incidentally , can not be towed because of the strong wind , " he declared . Supplies Running Low . Some of the snow-bound village-4 in Long Island , as well as in New Jersey , were reported to be running short of coal , food and milk sup . plies . Just before 10 o'clock last night , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of snow had reached 9.2 inches , which just equaled the total fall of snow in last week 's blizzard . In some parts of the city the snow stopped falling before 11 P. M. , but in others it continued , very lightly . The snow , falling steadily since 11:20 A. M. Sunday , was carried on a northeast gale , which along the Atlantic seaboard reached a velocity of forty miles an hour , but did not exceed twenty miles in New York , The wind , which shifted to the north last night and increased in velocity , brought clear skies shortly after last midnight , but cold weather , with a drop in tempera-4 ture to zero was predicted for dawn this morning . Nine storm victims died yesterday in the metropolitan area and at least fifty-five have been injured , The death toll in the nation front the freakish weather of the last few days  --  the cold and blinding snowstorms in the North and the tornadoes in the South  --  was esti ? mated at sixty yesterday , according to an Associated Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering and hardship were reported . Numerous small commue nities , particularly in New Eng . land , were isolated by high-piled drifts ; trains were delayed from the Mississippi to the Atlantic ; New England roads were blocked and bus schedules to the North were disrupted . To New Yorkers , slipping and skidding to work yesterday  --  their faces stung by the pelting particles of snow  --  the storm , for the second time within a week , revived memories of the " great blizzard of ' 88 . " But the thirty-six-hour fall did not approach in volume the snow of forty-six years ago that old residents still talk about . The 9.2-inch fall , added to the 9.6 inches that fell on Feb. 1 , and the 19.2 inch snow of last week  --  which for a time almost paralyzed the metropolitan area  --  gives to February , 1934 , a total of about twentynine inches , the greatest total for any one month since February , 1894 . Dr. James H. Kimball , characterizing this total as a " very respectable one , " said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been so dry . The fine sharp flakes packed down in a solid mantle . Yesterday 's snow ? fortunately for New York , the Weather Bureau pointed out  --  did not have a tendency to drift as much as last week 's gale-blown flakes .. Yesterday 's temperatures  --  though well below the usual " snow-point " of 32 , were not extremely low . The hourly readings follow : Midnight ** 2 P. M 211 1 A. M ' 3 P. M 2 A. M 18 4 P. M 3A .

' nofficlat street temperature at Times Square . which is usually four degrees above the official reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Winter as a whole , had been the year 's offender . January and December , generally speaking , were " mild , " and the Winter as a whole was not particularly unusual , but February has piled up a " very unusual " record not only in snow accumulation , but also in cold . The average daily temperature for the month has been ten degrees under normal . The storm centre that brought New York its white mantle was reported last night as moving up the coast , out at sea , and late in the evening  --  the " low " was centred off Nantucket . A high pressure area , centred last night in Kansas or Nebraska , was reported moving eastward , and it is this " high , " with its accompanying north and northwest winds of twenty to thirty miles velocity , which is expected to bring to New York the low temperatures predicted for this morning . The latest storm in February 's calendar will bring New York a bill of *2,000,000 for snow removal . Sanitation Commissioner Ernest P. Goodrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later in the day , with his overworked department almost bogged under , it was said that another *1,000,000 may be needed before the city digs out of the drifts . About 30,000 men , who will be supplemented today , 39,009 additional emergency workers , struggled all day yesterday , as the snow flakes covered their overcoats , with a rising tide of snow . Mr. Goodrich said last night that despite the efforts of the largest snow-fighting army ever enlisted in any of the city 's numerous battles against the vicissitudes of Winter , it will be more than a week before the streets will be clear . So much snow has fallen this Winter , the commissioner revealed , that among the city 's army of snow shovelers , recruited from the unemployed and with 1,000 National Guardsmen acting as foremen , there has sprung up a number of rackets , which be promised to crush . Transportation systems in the city itself suffered some delays yesterday , with the surface car lines and outlying bus lines as usual faring worse than the protected subways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight delay ; the elevated lines , though handicapped by the snow , were not seriously delayed . Of the railroads , the Long Island ? as in last week 's storm  --  reported the most delay . Thousands of COMmuters  --  many of whom clogged the Long Lone ' Island stations in Manhattan and Brooklyn last night in vain attempts to get home  --  spent the night in the city , and hotels and rooming houses were crowded with guests for a night . Other railroads reported relatively small delays . Commuters ' trains to Westchester , Connecticut and Northern New Jersey generally ran close to their schedules , though through trains from the West and South were in some instances as late as two hours . Thel New York Central reported that its Mohawk Valley division was particularly hard hit , though all trains pushed their ways through the storm without mishap . Ferryboats and harbor traffic were slightly delayed by ice and poor visibility . The steamer Richard Peck from Boston docked three hours late after becoming stuck in an ice floe near Hell Gate . Buses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; schedules to Boston and other New England points were abandoned , and persons who tried to venture off the main roads in the metropolitan area  --  roads which were kept fairly clear by snowplows  --  found themselves bogged in drifts many feet deep . As in last week 's storm , many automobiles were abandoned temporarily by their owners as snow heaped high about them . So severe was the storm In some parts of the city and its suburbs that many schools closed for the day when numerous children were kept at home by their parents . This was particularly true in Queens and in many parts of Long Island and New Jersey . The storm created so acute an emergency that Washington granted permission to the Civil Works Administration here to employ CWA workers for snow removal . Newark , already in financial straits , was cheered by the permission to use its CWA men , thus saving the city a tidy bill . As soon as permission was received from Washington telegrams were sent to local Civil Works administrators in various parts of the State . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off duty at 8 A. M. yesterday , were held at their posts all day . A repetition of last week 's emergency , in which many outlying sections of the city were blocked off by snow drifts and others were left without adequate fire protection when fire-alarm boxes went out of commission , was not expected , however . Harry A. Cronk , president of the Borden 's Farm Products Company , said last night that the city was assured of a full supply of milk for the next twenty-four hours at least . Point Lookout again was cut off by the storm , he said , but two days ' supply of milk , which was delivered there Sunday , will be sufficient to tide the section over , he predicted . Outlying districts of the metropolitan area bore the brunt of the storm . On Long Island many sections were completely " snowed in . " Coney Island 's boardwalk was packed deep In drifts . Sea Gate was cut off from transportation ; in Nassau County all schools were closed ; many roads were impassable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island Railroad 's schedule was disrupted by the storm . In New Jersey commuters were not so seriously delayed by the snow , but Atlantic City was buried under seven inches of snow ; Cape May was isolated , and nine pilots and twelve enlisted men of the Naval Reserve Aviation Squadron at Philadelphia were grounded there , stormbound with their seven planes . The main roads in Jersey were kept open by the State 's road plows , but side roads were blocked with snow . For the persistent commuters , the storm had its lighter moments . Many of them  --  so many in fact that New York reported a shortage of snowshoes and skis  --  employed new methods to get from their homes to the railroad stations . Others warned by last week 's blizzard , had stocked up on overshoes , ear-muffs and articles to such an extent that the supply of these articles was fast running out . As an aftermath of last week 's storm fifty-eight men and women were fined $1 each in West Side Court for failing to remove ice from sidewalks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
