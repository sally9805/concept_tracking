Most economists agree that sustained U. S. recovery depends on a real rise in demand for producer goods . Last week there were signs of such a rise . Meanwhile , General Motors ' report on 1938 earnings brought home last year 's ominous disparity between recovery in consumer and producer goods . <P> General Motors is the biggest unit in the great U. S. automobile industry ( consumer goods ) . G. M. had a 1938 profit of $102,320,000 compared to a 1937 profit of $196,436,598 . The last quarter of 1938 was the ninth best in G. M. history , contributing $63,932,000 ( about 62% ) of the year 's net . <P> U. S. Steel is the biggest unit in the biggest of U. S. producer-goods industries . Compared to a 1937 profit of $94,944,358 , U. S. Steel had a 1938 deficit of $7,755,914 - despite a final-quarter pickup in operations which earned a profit of $4,394,454 . <P> First among last week 's omens of better times was the news that steel operations reached a 1939 high of 53.4% of capacity and that U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , with heavy steels rising in proportion to light . <P> Other portents : Settlement of the TVA fight ( TIME , Feb. 13 ) apparently cleared the decks for utility modernization , and last week another major purchaser of producer goods-the railroads-seemed hellbent on a spending spree . Union Pacific announced a $15,000,000 expansion program-new rails , box cars , locomotives and remodeled coaches . Missouri Pacific ordered $1,500,000 worth of rails . All told , railway-equipment manufacturers said that already this year they had received orders for 375,000 tons of rails , only 25,000 tons less than 1938 's total orders .
