In 24 newspaper offices throughout the land excited groups of newsmen stood around an imposing array of switchboards , generators , motors , and lathe-like machines . Lights flashed on the switchboards - green , red , white . Needles swung on dials . Whistles shrilled from loudspeakers , then a voice : <P> " New York speaking . This will be the first official roll call for Wirephoto . " <P> " Baltimore ready . " <P> " Ready , " piped Syracuse . <P> " Ready , " drawled Atlanta . <P> " Ready , " barked Detroit , Chicago , Oklahoma City-24 cities from Coast to Coast . <P> Roll-call ended , New York announced : <P> " First picture will be an aerial view of the wrecked airplane just found in the mountains in upper New York . A fine shot . Will send it now . " <P> Switches clicked , the lathe-like machines began to hum . Seventeen minutes later in each of the 24 offices an operator opened the machine , withdrew a large cylinder , rushed it to a dark room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked airplane was on editors ' desks around a 10,000 mi. circuit . Thus last week Associated Press inaugurated its new $1,000,000-a-year Wirephoto service ( TIME , May 7 ) . <P> In principle the A. P. 's new service , designed by American Telephone &; Telegraph , is what the world has long known as Telephoto . But A. T. &; T. , which developed Telephoto at a cost of $2,800,000 only to junk it for lack of patronage , has applied to Wirephoto a new technique* whereby it can transmit a picture so perfectly that the result is almost as good as the original . And instead of eight scattered Telephoto stations , often far from the news , Wirephoto has 24 to start with , any of which can send and receive pictures with all others . <P> When the airplane picture had hummed over the wires last week , the loudspeaker conversations were resumed with A. P. 's Picture Editor Norris A. Huse in New York acting as interlocutor and traffic director . <P> New York : What have you got , San Francisco ? <P> San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl at the Chinese telephone exchange , sending New Year 's greetings . The other shows a holiday crowd of young Chinese girls and fellows with lots of confetti and stuff . <P> New York : Any confetti with that switchboard girl ? <P> San Francisco : No , just the girl . <P> New York : Send the confetti one . What have you got , Los Angeles ? <P> Los Angeles had film two days ago but it 's good , it 's cute . CUTE , cute picture . " Dallas had Mexican Red Shirts arrested in Mexico City and Kansas City somewhat wistfully offered a view of the last session of the Bi-Cameral Legislature in Nebraska . " Okay , Dallas . " or " Okay , Miami , you take the network , " Editor Huse would direct . Or , if San Francisco had a picture of a missing lowan , of no interest to outsiders , Des Moines could get New York 's permission to have the picture flashed to the Des Moines Register and Tribune when the network was not too busy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
