txt Definite decision by Mayor Walker on a successor to Grover A. Whalen al Police Commissioner will await the return today of John F. Curry , leader of Tammany , it was said yesterday by friends of the Mayor . Although the Mayor has indicated clearly that he has picked the man , It was said that he naturally would wish to consult Mr. Curry before offering him the appointment . The general opinion among those closely associated with the Mayor yesterday - was that Richard C. Patterson Jr. , Commissioner of Correction , probably was the man whom the Mayor had selected tentatively . This belief was strengthened by a growing conviction that the Mayor would not go to the uniformed force for Mr. Whalen 's successor and that there was less chance of the appointment of Major William E. Deegan , Tenement House Commissioner , than appeared a week ago . Deegan Chances Fade . It was said that Mayor Walker had not offered the place to Mr. Patterson yet , but it was learned that his appointment had been urged by many persons of influence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Mayor had indicated to Major Deegan that he was satisfied with his work in his present post , which was regarded as indicating that he intended to keep him there . There has been no such indication , it was said , in the case of Mr. Patterson , who , like Major Deegan , is the head of a city-department and an appointee of the Mayor . Mr. Curry , who witnessed the running of the Kentucky Derby at Louisville , will return today . He left for Kentucky before ** Walker 's return from Bermuda and has not had a chance for a conference with the Mayor for several weeks . It is not believed by the Mayor 's friends that either Mr. Curry or Tammany has a candidate for Police Commissioner . In fact , the policy of the late Charles F. Murphy of keeping Tammany as far as possible from the Police Commissionership has become a tradition in Tammany . Mr. Murphy believed that Tammany supremacy in New York City could be threatened only by a major police scandal and that it was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Department . There is no reason to believe that Mr. Curry will wish to change this policy . It was said , however , that this did not mean that the leader of Tammany might not use a veto power to prevent the appointment of a particular individual as Police Commissioner , if he should deem it advisable . In any event , it was regarded as certain that Mayor Walker would not wish to appoint a new commissioner without at least going through the form of consulting the head of the political organization to which he owes his nomination for the Mayoralty . Should Mr. Walker wish to appoint Mr. Patterson , it was said there was little probability of serious opposition from Tammany . Mr. Patterson is a Democrat , although not identified with Tammany , and there is not believed to be any hostility toward him on the part of any of the Tammany leaders . The question of Mr. Whalen 's successor is expected LI be settled by the time Mr. Whalen keeps his appointment to see Mayor Walker again tomorrow . Should it not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his post on Wednesday any way , leaving First Deputy Commissioner Philip D. Hoyt in temporary command o fthe department , as he has been during Mr. Whalen 's absences from the city . Mr. Whalen was reported to have about finished packing his personal belongings at Police Headquarters and to be ready to move out at any time . It became known yesterday that Mr. Patterson visited Mr. Whalen at headquarters last Friday , and , in company with Mr. Whalen , met several of the executive officers of the department . Two Deputies May Retire . With the retirement of Mr. Whalen the five Deputy Commissioners automatically tender their resignations . It was said that two of these , Third Deputy Commissioner John A. Leach and Fourth Deputy Commissioner Nelson Ruttenberg , probably would leave as soon as their successors could be selected by the new commissioner . Mr. Leach , who served for ten years as a city magistrate and twelve years as a Deputy Police Commissioner , was reported to be ready to apply for retireinentf He has been In charge of the police trials in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan , was said to wish to resume the practice of law .
