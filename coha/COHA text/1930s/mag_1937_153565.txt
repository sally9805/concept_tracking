The Federal tax on undistributed corporate earnings might have grieved Business less had it come a year later than it did , because it so happens that working capital is the particular need of industry in 1937 . This was made abundantly clear in the first statistical study of the subject published by Business Week last April at the suggestion of Vice President Fenton B. Turck of American Radiator &; Standard Sanitary Corp . By the end of last year booming sales had necessitated enormously bigger inventories and inventory costs had jumped with the prices of raw materials . Industrial payrolls , furthermore , had swollen 30% since 1934 . Needing cash to meet his current obligations and more cash to pay for repairs and expansion , the average manufacturer hated like sin to give the Government a cut of his profits . Result was that last Christmas U. S. Business showered down the biggest crop of dividends and extra dividends in years . <P> It was not love of their stockholders which moved many a board of directors to pay out as much as 99% of earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contented stockholders would buy more stock , return to their company as much cash or more than they received in dividends . One of the first big companies to go the whole hog on this method of making everybody but the Collector of Internal Revenue happy was Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , which paid out approximately all it earned to its 34,500 stockholders , then proceeded to sell them $43,000,000 worth of new stock ( TIME , Nov. 9 ) . Since then the necessity to replenish working capital funds depleted by year-end dividends has been a big factor in starting up belated activity in new capital financing . <P> In its annual report last week ( see col. 1 ) the Federal Reserve Board noted that in 1936 securities issued to obtain new capital amounted to $1,200,000,000 , or more than the aggregate for the previous four years combined . During the first five months of 1937 new corporate capital financing totaled $526,187,000 compared to $310,709,000 in the same period of 1936 . Notable issues : by Johns-Manville , $10,000,000 in common stock ; by Pennsylvania Railroad , $52,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock ; by Fruehauf Trailer Co. , $1,500,000 in debentures ; by Wilson &; Co. , $6,500,000 in debentures ; by Inland Steel Co. , $10,000,000 in bonds . June underwritings included a $75,000,000 debenture issue by Socony-Vacuum , $15,000,000 in Safeway Stores debentures . <P> Latest addition to this list was Standard Brands which last week offered through a Morgan Stanley &; Co. syndicate 200,000 shares of $4.50 cumulative preferred stock at $95 per share . It happened to be Morgan Stanley 's first flotation of preferred stock in its two years of underwriting history. *
