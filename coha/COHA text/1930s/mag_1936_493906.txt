The Spirit of Jazz BENNY GOODMAN was born in what he now refers back to as the Chicago ghetto twenty-seven years ago , and about twelve Years later showed up in knee pants on one of the river boats , to play in a small jazz band with Bix Beiderbecke , dead now and immortal ( Go away boy , Bix is reported to have said , Do n't mess around with the instruments ) . But Benny Goodman had with him a clarinet of his own which at that time must have been as long as he was , and he had a superior sense of music ; he played with the band all right . He played around all the time in those first days , studying under good men , mastering his difficult instrument , and going to high school a little , and after that forming a band with a few boys from . some sort of conservatory he attended ? historic names now , Bud Freeman , Dave Tuft , NIuggsy Spanier . And at the age of sixteen he went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as historic as the deuce . He stayed with the organization about four years , playing it out every night , working alongside such men as that force on the trombone , Mr. Jack ( Big-Gate ) Teagarden , learning . When he left Pollack he worked here and there in New York , in pit and stage and radio bands , recording and later getting up a band of his own . But that is all an interim period for most of us . The general public must have heard his music at one time or another , but there was no ballyhoo to announce where it was coming from . Then less than two years ago he started going to town for the general public , and reports came back from the Palomar in Los Angeles that you could not get within fifty yards of the stand , and afterwards you could hear over the Congress Hotel 's wire in Chicago that this might have been a sedate enough ballroom before . but now Benny was in and blowing the roof off , and they were yelling from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the main room at the Pennsylvania Hotel . The room as you come in is spacious and warm with the air of moderately well-to-do living , people and tables filling the space around the floor and around the raised walk on all tour sides , waiters and captains bustling in a quiet efficiency of silver and steam and flourish . But the far side of the room is the main side , where the boys sit high and easy in their chairs and Benny Goodman stands in front , quiet or smiling into the ? spotlight or tilting his instrument to the rafters as they rise to the take-off . Sooner or later they will lead into one of those Fletcher Henderson arrangements of an old favorite , and the whole riding motion of the orchestra will be felt even through the thick carpets and the babble of the crowd , and those with two feet under them will move out onto the floor , because the music can be heard best when it is fulfilling its original simple purpose , coming through the ears and the good living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choruses the boys will let out a little of that flash and rhythmic power which make these separate defined instruments into something indefinable , a thumping big band with the whole room under its thumb ( " Got the world in a jug " ) ; the floor will become solid with people , even some of the bare backs and stiff shirts will jolly up noticeably and perhaps do the truck a little ( dear , dear ) . And then even with the final blast of the out-chorus still echoing in the hall . everything is suddenly natural and work-a-day . The men put up their instruments , stretch , look about them , file off at random ; Benny stands leafing - through his music to give out the numbers for the next set , recognizing as many people as is expedient , later going off to sit at a table somewhere : How 's everything , that 's fine . Himself , he 's on the wagon tonight ; he drinks with glum heroism at a glass of plain water . " A scotch here and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ? You know ? " So now he feels better in the morning . He has a heavy voice coming from well down under the ribs and pleasant with the forthright lively concision of popular speech . Someone comes up , moving with vast importance , and desires that Benny should intervene with the Selmer people . They make clarinets and it seems they 've got some conspiracy of imprecise mouthpieces as against the gentleman in question : if she plays good high . then she do n't play good low ; likewise vice versa . Benny says come around after , he 'll see ; then presently out of the side of his mouth : Never was one of the things that would play right by itself , you have to nurse it . You know a clarinet ? What 's he think I can do about a damn clarinet , drive me crazy . Benny Goodman looks sadly at the scotch on the table and drinks his water . By now a slight and quiet young man has detached himself from the gossip and joshing of the musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano ? on which he has only time left to run through two numbers , if that . In a place like this , where there are too many dine-and-dancers too sure that a young man sitting at an upright piano ca n't be anything to hush your mouth about , Teddy Wilson is as fine an artist at starting late and quitting early as he is at his music , which is the finest . He runs through a few chords . Anyone who wants to hear it a little can move over to the piano . Some do . just playing to amuse myself is all , Teddy says . Well how about that Waller tune " Squeeze Me , " Teddy ; you used to play that pretty nice . Oh that ? he says with his fine smile . I believe I forgot that z THE NEW one by now . He feels through the chords with unerring musical sense and listens for the turn of phrase in some backward corner of his mind ? like the mind of any good jazz musician it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have thought lovely and then presently put aside for new toys . He finishes , repeats the last phrase . Hm , I knew I did n't have that one rightly any more , he says , shaking his head . But the song is hack for us , the song never died at all . He starts the first chords over and this time his right hand is released from concentration and free on the keyboard , and to get the pattern in music of those clear single notes without hearing the phrase as it is struck off , you would have to make some such visual image as that of a common tin plate scaled up into the sun , where there would be not only the flash and motion but the startling effect of flight , the rise and banking in curves , the hesitation and slipping off , and the plunge straight down coming suddenly . Wilson in his best mood of creation is something like that . These nights he shows to better advantage when he comes out with the quartet . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fine in many ways . Remember that he is a Negro in a white man 's world , a jazz player in a world where the thirst for music is so artificial it can not attend with comfort anything not solemnized . And then see the quiet repose and lack of cocksureness , strut or show , the straightforward and friendly absence of assumption that comes only from a secure awareness of the dignity of a person and of his work . But even if this were the place for oversolemn pronouncements , there is n't the time . The stand is filling up again , the boys sucking on reeds , limbering up valves ? doing whatever it is that musicians do with a sort of happy-go-lucky boredom . There is no more than time to say , as the first pop tune starts to go up in smoke , that memory may fade and the current musical note perish , but that fifty years around the recorded music of Mr. Teddy Wilson ( now craftily surprised that the band came back so soon ) should have established him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the best lyricists of any time or form . Swing in , swing out , the band is up again and drawing the people out like the sun in the fable . With Krupa , Reuss ( guitar ) and the inspired quiet Stacey ( piano ) laying down a thick rhythmic base , it plays on through whatever songs are the demand of the day , making most of them sound like something . This is an organization in the line of the great jazz bands ? jean Goldkette , Fletcher Henderson , McKinney 's Cotton Pickers , Ellington , Kirk , et al. ? a little lighter than some of these but more beautifully rehearsed and economical , and with cleaner edges . The reed section , scored as such , is more prominent than in older hot bands , giving a fuller lyric quality ; but the section ( five men counting Goodman ) has a hard skeleton of attack and swing that supports any relative lightness of brass . The band as a whole gets its lift from the // rhythm men and the soloists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than tailored ? thanks to the talent , ideas and leadership of one man . The recent spreading of interest in good jazz to some extent made Benny Goodman 's current music possible , and to some extent was made possible by Benny Goodman 's music . He got good men working together , got some ace arrangements of all the good tunes , new and old , and played them wide open though bands were n't supposed to be successful that way . It was n't so much that he made the people like it as that he gave them a chance to see what it was like when done well ( too many hot bands have sounded like a barnyard until they got going around 2 A.M. ) . And one of the important things about his show is that he went right ahead with the same method of getting good music when it came to the old color-line bogey . He would introduce Teddy Wilson as playing with the trio , and the people would bang hands for more ( they say on some nights he even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So hotel managers would get the point almost painlessly : and could no longer say No beforehand , on the ground that people would not stand for it . And when the trio got Lionel Hampton to play the vibraphone , the balance between black and white was even ( two of each ) , and still no kick . Stand for it ? ? the people stand up from their tables just to hear it better . They play every night ? clarinet , piano , vibraphone , drums , and they make music you would not believe . No arrangements , not a false note , one finishing his solo and dropping into background support , then the other , all adding inspiration until with some number like " Stomping at the Savoy " they get going too strong to quit ? four choruses , someone starts up another , six , eight , and still someone starts ? no two notes the same and no one note off the chord , the more they relax in the excitement of it the more a natural genius in preselection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigorously pure . This is really composition on the spot , with the spirit of jazz strongly over all of them but the iron laws of harmony and rhythm never lost sight of ; and it is a collective thing , the most beautiful example of men working together to be seen in public today . It is n't merely hell-for-leather either . Gene Krupa , a handsome madman over his drums , makes the rhythmic force and impetus of it visual , for his face and whole body are sensitive to each strong beat of the ensemble ; and Hampton does somewhat the same for the line of melody , hanging solicitous over the vibraphone plates and exhorting them ( Hmmm , Oh , Oh yah , Oh dear hmmm ) . But the depth of tone and feeling is mainly invisible , for they might play.their number " Exactly Like You " enough to make people cry and there would be nothing of it seen except perhaps in the lines of feeling on Benny Goodman 's face , the affable smile dropped as he follows the Wilson solo flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special feeling among them the first morning they recorded this piece , the ghost of the blues perhaps ; and when the clarinet takes up you will hear the phrases fall as clear as rain , with a sustained glow of personal essence that starts where command of the instrument ( the tension of mouth , delicate fingering . etc. ) leaves off . Then Hampton sings a chorus , his vibrant hoarse voice and relaxed emphasis so appropriate to the general color ; and when they take up again the instruments blend so perfectly as to be indistinguishable , singing in unison with a sweet breadth of tone that goes beyond the present place and time to some obscure source of feeling and native belief . The term swing ? no more definable in words than the term poetry ? is defined at its best in this piece , where the actual beats are lost sight of in the main effect , so that the inexorable and brute lift of the time signature as carried in Krupa 's great drum seems fused in the harmony and melodic line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing starts in the blood only that these four men are quite simple and wonderful together . that they are truly swinging . The quartet is a beautiful thing all through , really a labor of creative love , but it can not last forever and as the band starts again you realize that even in jazz there are several kinds of musical appreciation . For if they 'll agree to put on the " Bugle Call Rag " before the end of the evening I 'll be willing to say there 's nothing finer . There is some hidden lift to this old band standby , with its twenty quaint notes from the " Assembly " call dropping the barrier to a straight-out progression of simple chords ? and they are off , riding it with collective assurance and fine spirit , the men in their sections , the sections balancing . the soloists dropping back with care for the total effect . The guests are presently banked in a half-moon around the stand , unable to be still through it or move away either ; and as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of subtle thunder and Benny lacing in phrases , the air is full of brass and of rhythms you can almost lean on . The music seems more than audible , rising and coming forward from the stand in banks of colors and shifting masses ? not only the clangor in the ears but a visual picture of the intricate fitted spans , the breathless height and spring of a steel-bridge structure . And if you leave at the end , before the " Good-Bye " signature , you will seem to hear this great rattling march of the hobos through the taxis , lights and people , ringing under the low sky over Manhattan as if it were a strange high thing after all ( which it is ) and as if it came from the American ground under these buildings , roads and motor cars ( which it did ) . And if you leave the band and quartet and piano of the Goodman show and still are no more than slightly amused , you may be sure that in the smug absence of your attention a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message for your grandchildren to study through their patient glasses .
