In booking Bastress , Vaughan said that the prisoner " accepted a bribe while acting as chief inspector of the Bureau of Buildings . " Mr. Hastings was called on the telephone at 3 o'clock this morning , after Bastress had been put in the cell , and was asked if he could say specifically on what the bribery charge was based . " The charge is bribery , " he declared , " but I do not wish to say anything more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal the details at this time . " All day , folIcsving Mr. Higgins 's conference with Mr. Hastings , there were rumors in the district attorney 's office that there was a strong probability of indictments resulting from the Higgins investigations , which are to be conducted , not only in the Manhattan Bureau of Buildings , but in the other boroughs as well . Harvey Attacks Higgins . Borough President George U. Harvey of Queens made a scathing attack on Commissioner Higgins , charging him with inefficiency and negligence of his duties , and threat . ening to ask the legislative investi ? gating committee to investigate Mr , Higgins before it investigated aril other official . Mr. Harvey , apparentu ly provoked by the Higgins inquiry ' into the Queens Borough President 's office , said the Higgins investigators were " trying to put the only independent administration in the city on the spot . " He accused Mr. Higgins of digging up political propaganda with the purpose of diverting the attention of the Seabury investigation from Tammany corruption . Borough President Samuel Levy of Manhattan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superintendent , and ' Bastress , had resigned suddenly , said there had been no further resignations . Asked if any records of the Manhattan Building Department had been subpoenaed in any of the investigations under way , he said none had been . When he was asked what he thought of the recent developments in his department , he said : " I do n't expect a man who is getting $2,400 a year or less to have all the brains in the world , but I not only will expect honesty from him ; I will demand it . " Mr. Levy declined to specify who he meant or to amplify his statement . Both the officials who resigned earned more than twice the salary he mentioned . Mr. Higgins went to see Mr. Crain voluntarily . After giving him the results of the investigation thus far , he informed him that it was being continued in the hope that further information would be uncovered . Commissioner Higgins also informed the District Attorney that he was investigating the building bureaus in Queens and Brooklyn and expected to start similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scheduled to begin today . No date has been set for the beginning of the Bronx inquiry . Mr. Higgins has six men assigned to the Queens Bureau of Buildings and three other investigators have just finished an examination of the Brooklyn bureau . Harvey Assails Higgins . Mr. Harvey of Queens made his attack on Mr. Higgins In a statement issued last night from the Queens Borough Hall . The statement follows : " I believe that the key to the whole situation may be found in the records of the so-called investigations conducted by Higgins . The Commissioner of Accounts is supposed to keep things straight in the official household , but it appears that he was blissfully ignorant of things going on under his nose or was woefully negligent of his duties . " Mr. Higgins should be investigated before any other official . " Mr. Higgins moved ' into Borough Hall with us on Jan. 2 , 1929. and he has been here ever since . His investigator 's are with us every , day , poring over records and trying to find some way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York on the spot . " If Mr. Higgins had devoted his time to serious investigations of the various bureaus where politicians have been allowed to run rampant , New York City would have no scandal today . Instead . he , has devoted all his resources to the job of digging up political propaganda . It is especially noticeable around election time . when Mr. Higgins issues all sorts of , statements against candidates and parties opposed to his own crowd . Says Scandals Are Ignored . " Let us consider some of the in- ' vestigations launched by Mr. Higgins in the past with great fanfare and blowing of trumpets . There was the probe into the Street Cleaning Bureau of Queens which was dumped into my lap when I took office . Mr. Higgins made all sorts of charges and demanded the removal of everybody from Deputy Superintendent William Stevenson down . Not one charge was sustained in court . The only positive action was taken by me when I removed certain men on evidence that I obtained first hand . " Mr. Stevenson has been reappointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did Mr. Higgins do about the charges that jobs were being sold in the Board of Education ? What did he do in the scandal that broke in the probation office in Manhattan ? What did he do on the investigation of the milk scandals ? " And , of course , we must remember the passive role that Mr. Higgins played in the sewer scandals in Queens . Where was the city 's chief investigator when judgeships were being sold ? Where was he when the Bureau of Permits was held up to suspicion ? Predicts a " Counter-Irritant . " " Mr. Higgins has the power of subpoena and the right to investigate every department and bureau of the city of New York . He has the right to call every official , from the Mayor down , into his office for questioning . If he had honestly and thoroughly fulfilled his role as the city 's chief investigator , if he had been truly the ' eyes ' of the Mayor , the city administration would have been able to keep its house in order without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every move we make in this borough is reported to Mr. Higgins within twenty-four hours . The fact that he has kept us under such surveillance for more than two years without developing any serious charges against this administration should be regarded as a high compliment to our honesty and efficiency . " Now after years of being asleep at the switch , Mr. Higgins is becoming excited over irregularities in his own front yard . We fondly expect him to turn his full attention to the only independent administration in the City of New York for the purpose of setting up a counter-irritant to offset the activities of Mr. Seabury and the Legislative investigators . " If Mr. Higgins wishes to conduct an honest investigation in Queens , I will gladly give him my fullest cooperation . I have no illusions about Mr. Higgins , however . I know that he is worki with a political group that would like to divert the attention of Mr. Seabury from the rotten , corrupt and sinful practices that have been going on in Manhattan for years to some one not a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
