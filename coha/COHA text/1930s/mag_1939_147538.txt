Once again Californians are about to vote solemnly-on November 7-on a screwball proposition lovingly called " ham- &-eggs"-pensions; of $30 a week , payable every Thursday , to unemployed citizens over 50 , to be financed in part by a tax of 3% on gross incomes ( including securities sales ) of over $3,000 a year . <P> Last week , while betters were offering <P> 2-to-1 that " ham- &-eggs"; would be defeated and Marlene Dietrich , new U. S. citizen , was registering to cast her first vote ( see cut ) , many a California businessman was wondering what he would do if $30-every-Thursday became a reality . <P> Beyond the wondering stage and into reality went the San Francisco Exchange , which handles some $100,000,000 in sales annually , could clearly see its business vanishing into other States if " ham- &-eggs"; brought the threat of an annual tax of $3,000,000-a tax greater than the total of brokers ' commissions . If " ham- &-eggs"; passed , announced President William R. Bacon , the Exchange would move to taxfree , divorce-famed Reno , Nev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For last week papers for the incorporation of The San Francisco Stock Exchange Inc. were filed in Reno , and a Reno realtor was readying specifications for a handsome stock exchange building , safely across the line from California 's 3%.
