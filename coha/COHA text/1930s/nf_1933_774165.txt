Having accepted emancipation as a military measure , Lincoln was prepared to advocate an amendment to the Constitution in order to secure the proper basis for the prohibition of slavery . In Amendment December , 1863 , Representative Ashley of Ohio introduced into the House a resolution proposing such an amendment ; but it failed to secure the two-thirds majority necessary for adoption , and the matter rested there until the next meeting of Congress , in December , 1864 . When the momentous measure came before the House for final roll call on January 31 , 1865 , it received 119 yeas to 56 nays . In the campaign for ratification it required extraordinary exertions in order to secure the approval of the legislatures of three fourths of the states then theoretically composing the Union .

It required that a clear majority of the voters of any state take the oath of allegiance before reconstruction could begin .

Though the exigencies of war compelled Davis to be as " autocratic " as Lincoln , the temper and tradition of the South were far less favorable to executive centralization . Political opposition to President Davis 's conduct of the war was constant and bitter . Editors of influential papers called him " an incubus " and spoke of him as directing affairs " from his cushioned seat in Richmond .

Especially in the original states of the seaboard was there official resistance to the acts of Congress for the conscription of men , the impressment of food , the suspension of the writ of Habeas Corpus , the control of the militia , and the regulation of exports and imports . The impetuous Governor Joseph Brown of Georgia denounced the Conscription Act as " unconstitutional , " and after the fall of Atlanta threatened the Secretary of War , Seddon , that he would call all the sons of Georgia to " return to their state and rally round her glorious flag . " Governor Vance of North Carolina carried on an interminable correspondence with the authorities at Richmond , objecting to every measure of Congress or the executive that was designed to help win the war .

Early in 1865 the rumor was abroad in Richmond that a cabal in Congress had arranged to set aside President Davis and offer a dictatorship to General Lee . Notwithstanding all this opposition to the " tyranny " of Jefferson Davis , the Confederate administration was , on the whole , more observant of constitutional limitations than was the Federal government . While Lincoln was authorized lin 1863 to suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus whenever and wherever he pleased , the Confederate Congress withheld any such blanket authority from President I ) avis.

" ' One of the most striking dissimilarities between the sections lay in the different methods the respective governments used in providing the financial sinews of war . In the North there were large amounts of money in circulation and on deposit in the banks ; but the South , except in a few centers , like New Orleans , Charleston , and Richmond , had scant supplies of fluid capital . Southern wealth was in the cotton crop , and the eventual marketing of that crop was the resource on which the fiscal policy of the Confederacy was based . When the $20,000,000 or so of specie obtained at the beginning of the war 2 had been exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 J. C. Schwab , " The Confederate States of America , " p. 220. 2 This specie had been secured through the seizure of the money in the mints of the South and from a $15,000,000 loan at 8 per cent , the interest on which was guaranteed by an export duty on cotton .  | the government at Richmond turned with grim determination to the issuance of Treasury notes . It never realized more than trifling amounts from taxation or loans . While the precise volume of non-interest-bearing notes issued by the Confederate government is not known , conservative scholars estimate it at no less than $1,000,000,000 . By the spring of 1863 the Confederate paper dollar was worth only 33 cents in gold . After Gettysburg and Vicksburg it sank to 10 cents and at the close of the war to 1.6 cents . The inflation of the currency sent prices soaring and induced a fever of speculation in commodities . Flour sold at $1000 a barrel , shoes at $200 a pair , coffee at $40 a pound , and wood at $5 a stick . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , the government commandeered it by impressment . But the process was wasteful and inefficient . Beef , bacon , flour , and cotton were accumulated at points whence they could not be distributed for lack of an adequate transportation system , or were destroyed before the advance of the Federal armies or sold by dishonest agents . Although the Confederate government did not make its notes legal tender , ' it still found itself obliged to resort to partial repudiation . In February , 1864 , when the paper dollar was worth only 6 cents , the holders of the notes were given the option of converting them into 4 per cent bonds or accepting a new standard of value , in which three of the old dollars were equal to two of the new . This act gave the finishing stroke to Confederate credit .

Early in 1863 , when the military hopes of the South were high , Emile Erlanger , a Paris banker , agreed to float in Europe footnote 1 Some of the state governments , however , compelled creditors to receive the notes , and public opinion was exerted in various ways to coerce those who refused them .  | a loan of $15,000,000 bearing 7 per cent interest , the principal payable in New Orleans cotton at 12 cents a pound , within six months after the conclusion of peace . As cotton had advanced in England from 14 cents a pound in May , 1861 , to 44 cents in December , 1862 , the loan offered roseate promises of profit ? provided the South could get the cotton to Europe . ' Erlanger took the bonds at 77 and sold them readily in England at 952 , a figure from which they rapidly declined .

Only Erlanger profited by the transaction , clearing some $2,500,000 on the deal . The Federal government was at times sorely pressed for specie , but its financial condition was never so serious as was that of the Confederacy . In July , 1861 , Congress authorized Secretary Chase to borrow $250,000,000 , increased the tariff , and levied a direct tax of $20,000,000 on the states and an income tax of 3 per cent on incomes above $800 . By an appeal to the New York bankers , Chase secured a loan of $150,000,000 in August , but the opening of the year 1862 found the Federal government in debt $100,000,000 , with an estimated need of $250,000,000 more before the end of June .

Besides , new tax schedules would not yield their revenue footnote ' Of the 430,000 bales of cotton which the Confederate government secured from produce loans or impressment , less than 20,000 or 5 per cent , got through the inexorable Federal blockade . 2 The bondholders , who lost approximately $10,000,000 , continued for a score of years to entertain hopes of recovering their investment , though the Confederate debt was repudiated by the Fourteenth Amendment .  | for a year , and meanwhile the needs of the Treasury were pressing . The answer to the problem was found in the emission of an unsupported paper currency . Over the protests of bankers and economists , Congress passed an act on February 25 , 1862 , authorizing the issue of $150,000,000 non-interestbearing Treasury notes , which were to be legal tender , receivable for all debts and public dues except duties on imports . They were convertible into 6 per cent bonds , called the " fivetwenties , " due in twenty years but redeemable at the pleasure of the government after five years . A new tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every product of industry and process of exchange . On July 14 the tariff was raised . The legal-tender notes , popularly called greenbacks , were a source of injustice , since they furnished debtors with a currency for paying their debts cheaper than that in which the debts had been contracted . ' Moreover , the easy expedient of printing paper and endowing it with the quality of " money " by fiat proved so strong a temptation to a government in urgent need of funds that by 1864 the volume of greenbacks had reached $449,338,902 . The inevitable result was an inflation in prices and speculation in specie . In terms of the paper currency , gold stood at 172 in February , 1863 , and rose to 285 in July , 1864 , when General Early was threatening the defenses of Washington . The government thought it would be more profitable to issue greenbacks than to sell its bonds , which commanded approximately three fifths of their face value on the market , but it actually lost hundreds of millions by this policy . For with gold at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth only 35 cents and was paying in coin 17 per cent interest on its 6 per cent bonds . In January , 1863 , Secretary Chase was distressed by the plight of the Treasury . The bonded debt of the government was nearing $1,000,000,000 , and the expenses reached $2,500,000 a day . Gold was at a premium of 72 , reflecting lack of con- footnote ' Since the Constitution ( Art .

At this critical time the Secretary of the Treasury executed the most successful financial measure of the war in the creation of the national banking system . On February 25 , 181 ; 3 , Congress : authorized any group of five or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 10,000 inhabitants and of $50,000 in smaller centers , to organize a banking association . Having purchased United States bonds to the amount of at least one third of their capital stock , they were to receive from the Comptroller of the Currency notes equal to 9 ) 1 ) per cent , of the market value of the bonds . These " bank notes " were . a true national currency , receivable for all dues to the l ' nit ed States ( except customs duties , which must be in coin for the payment of the interest on the bonds ) and protected from the fluctuations of the state-bank currency by the credit of the United States bonds behind them . The National Dank Act was a blessing in every way . Besides creating a stable national currency to replace the notes of the state banks , ' it opened a market for the sale of the government 's bonds . The bankers , in addition to receiving the interest on the bonds , enjoyed the profits from the loan of the bank notes to their customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted in the support of the government securities which lay behind their currency . It was an ingenious device for distributing the burden of the debt through the community - without the sinister features of a forced loan or currency inflation , which characterized the issue of the greenbacks . And the national bank system served the country well until the twentieth century , when the bonded indebtedness of the United States became too narrow a basis for the support of a currency adequate to the increasing volume of business.2 footnote 1 In 1861 there were nine hundred state banks issuing notes without a ' specie basis . Almost all of the state-bank notes were subject to wide fluctuations in value and were easily counterfeited . By an act of March 3 , 1865 , a tax of 10 per cent was imposed on them , driving them out of circulation . 2 The remedy was found in the Glass-Owen Act of 1913 , which established the Federal Reserve banking system .  | In the Civil War , as in all wars , " the instincts of trade conflicted with the instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the North , the extremity of the goverment was the opportunity of the profiteer . Huge profits were made by selling supplies , often of inferior quality , to the government and by speculating in the fluctuating values of all commodities . Politicians , government officials , and even military leaders speculated in cotton . But the range of speculation was somewhat limited in the South . The region was not sufficiently developed in manufactures , transportation , banking , or capital accumulations to take care of itself . The blockade slowly crushed its economic life . The destitution of the South serves as a somber foil for the bright prosperity of the North . After a temporary embarrassment caused by the shock of war , the loss , of Southern markets , the drain of specie from the banks , and the disappearance of a metallic currency , Northern enterprises expanded rapidly . A bewildering array of statistics shows the progress in agriculture , manufactures , commerce , transportation , and public works during the four years of the war . ' The unprecedented demand of the government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons , blankets , shoes , clothing , and food , ? the enlarged European market for our grain and beef , and the issue of an abundant national currency , all stimulated industry and sent prices soaring . Millionaires multiplied , and the newspapers commented caustically upon the emergence of a wealthy class which knew not how to spend its newly acquired fortunes . Luxury and extravagance ran riot . ' footnote 1 See E. D. Fite , " Social and Industrial Conditions in the North during the Civil War . " 2 It should be noted also that contributions to charities and endowments were unusually large . The Sanitary Commission , Christian Commission , Ladies ' Aid Societies , and numerous other associations for the relief of the soldiers and their families were the precursors of the Red Cross , the " Y 's , " the Knights of Columbus , and other relief agencies of the World War . Women , both North and South , were tireless in their works of mercy , though the women of the South were called upon to endure a greater burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North .  | The war also brought important modifications in the relations of capital and labor . It hastened the tendency , already visible in the decade of the fifties , toward the consolidation of capital . The extraordinary needs of the government encouraged business on a large scale . The enormous currency issues and the huge profits furnished abundant capital for investment . Rising prices called for the reduction of expense in management and overhead costs . The multiplicity of taxes on products in every stage of manufacture made the combination of as many industrial processes as possible in a single establishment profitable . And , finally , the combinations of manufacturers into powerful associations enabled them to exert an influence on the government in its tariff legislation . These factors all worked against the small manufacturer , breaking up that " self-reliant localism " in industry which had prevailed generally before the war . The lion 's share of the benefits of the new industry went to the capitalists . Wages and salaries lagged behind prices and profits . As usual , those who felt the pinch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined economic pressure , like the unskilled laborers , clerical workers , clergymen , school-teachers , and college professors . ' Before the war there were very few labor unions in the country , and they were local in influence and limited in membership. , Little need of united action was felt in the decade before 1860 , but with the sharp rise in prices and the tightening of capitalistic control , labor began to organize on a national basis . Printers , carpenters , masons , tailors , cigar-makers , and a score of other trades were unionized . Fifty new unions were represented at a meeting in New York near the close of 1863 , and there was talk of the need for general labor solidarity . footnote i For example , seamstresses in New York City in 1864 , working fourteen hours a day , earned less than $1.50 a week , while eight hundred women in Philadelphia were teaching school for 80 cents a day ? less than a washerwoman 's wages . 2 The London Times of December 1 , 1863 , said : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clover , in which it was petted and humored , it certainly was this North American community . " The statement refers to the years preceding the war .  | Indeed , the modern problems of American labor ? the strike , the boycott , the lockout , the " scab , " picketing , collective bargaining ? came rapidly to the fore in the sharp bifurcation of capital and labor during the Civil War . This concentration of industrial life was simply one aspect of the general centralizing tendency of the war . Our country was first welded into a true Union in the fierce fires of that ordeal . The national state replaced the federation of states . The war was not only the triumph of the North over the South , of freedom over slavery  --  it was also the triumph of nationalism over states ' rights , of Webster over Calhoun . Besides creating a national currency , a national banking system , a national army , and new national taxes , the war extended and enhanced the power of the central government in a score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier generation , assessed a direct tax upon the states , raised a national militia within their borders , cut off the western counties of Virginia and admitted them as a new state to the Union . With unprecedented open-handedness it gave homesteads to Western farmers , endowed colleges in all the states for the promotion of agriculture and the mechanical arts , made imperial grants of land to the newly chartered Pacific railroad and underwrote its bonds . National Republicans of 1825 , like John Quincy Adams or Henry Clay , would have stood aghast at the nationalism of the Republicans of 1865 . The economic prosperity of the North was a significant factor in determining the drift of our foreign relations during the war . The governments of Europe , with Anglo American two conspicuous exceptions , were favorable Relations to the Union . Great Britain and France gave their official , and at times officious , sympathy to the Confederacy .

Aware of the gravity of the situation , Lincoln sought to placate British opinion and to smooth out all diplomatic difficulties with a patient but firm hand . His task was not  | easy . The governing class in England , drawn from an aristocracy which had not changed essentially since the eight eenth century , regarded the plantation regime of the South as a higher social system than the assertive , leveling democracy of the North , while the great mercantile and industrial Inter ests resented the protective tariff and the blockade of the cotton ports . This British animus against the Union was counteracted , however , by the active sympathy of those liberal leaders , like John Bright , who believed that the cause of the North was the cause of liberty throughout the world . Alter Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation was announced , the masses in England began to support strongly the policies of the government at Washington . This drift of popular opinion was undoubtedly strengthened by the growing conviction that England needed Northern grain quite as much as she needed Southern cotton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American grain in mounting quantities , at a time when British and European harvests generally were below normal , had any influence on international affairs , they did admit that a war to secure cot ton would have been costly in foodstuffs. , Though Great Britain maintained its official neat ralit v , President Lincoln had constant trouble with the Palmerston ministry . In the first place , the queen 's proclamation recognized the Confederacy as a belligerent power in May , 1861 , before the South had won a battle on land or sea and before the American minister , Charles Francis Adams , had arrived in London . Lord John Russell , the foreign minister , explained to Adams that this action was only Great Britain 's way of announcing her strict neutrality , but it was resented in the United States as a premature expression of sympathy for the Confederacy . Toward the close of the year this resentment against Great Britain found expression in a dramatic incident . Two Confederate agents , Mason and Slidell , accredited to Great Britain and France respectively , passed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the significance of Northern grain , see E. D. Adams , " Great Britain and the American Civil War , " Vol . II , p. 13 , n.  | Trent at Havana , bound for Liverpool . The next day Captain Charles Wilkes , in command of the American sloop-of-war San Jacinto , overhauled the English ship , took off the two commissioners , and carried them to a fort in Boston Harbor . While the whole North rang with cheers for Captain Wilkes , the administration was confronted with troublesome questions on the law of the sea . The deed was clearly a violation of international law as we had interpreted it in the years immediately prior to the War of 1812 . In the light of our earlier protestations it was an example of unjustified search and seizure . When news of the affair reached England the ministry dispatched troops to Canada and sent a peremptory demand that Mason and Slidell be released and an official apology made for their seizure . In the face of a storm of hostility toward Great Britain , Lincoln and Seward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Confederate commissioners were " cheerfully liberated " and sent on their way , much to the disappointment of the South and of the " war-mongers " in England , who were anxious to aid in the disruption of the Union . But the most serious matter of controversy between the two countries was the building of ships in British yards to prey on the commerce of the United States . An act of Parliament of 1818 , the Foreign-Enlistment Act , forbade any subject of the realm to " equip , furnish , fit out , or arm any ship to be employed in the service of a foreign state , to commit hostilities against any state at peace with Great Britain . " Confederate agents , seeking to buy armed ships to molest the commerce of the United States , persuaded British shipbuilders that it was permissible to build ships in Great Britain for any purpose , provided they were equipped and armed outside the realm . On the strength of this evasion , Laird and Sons at Birkenhead built the Oreto , which sailed for Nassau in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her armament and rechristened the Florida . The " 290 " was under construction at the same yards when Adams protested to the ministry and asked that the vessel be detained . While the legal authorities argued , the " 290 " was completed , slipped out to sea , and  | proceeded to the Azores , where she received her heavy armament . Delivered over to Captain Semmes of the Confederate navy as the Alabama , she became the most famous of the commerce-destroyers , accounting for sixty merchant vessels before she was sunk by the Kearsarge off the coast of Cherbourg , France , on June 19 , 1864 . As the construction of other ships went forward , the British ministry treated with amiable indifference the protests of the United States government . Finally , Adams , having made repeated attempts to get Earl Russell to detain two powerful ironclad rams which were being built at Birkenhead , wrote on September 5 , 1863 , in the language of an ultimatum , " It would be superfluous in me to point out to your lordship that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the Alabama , and impressed by the victories of Gettysburg and Vicksburg , had already given orders two days before to have the rams detained . With this virtual confession of her unneutral conduct , Great Britain ceased to give aid and comfort to the Confederacy. , The French government , less able than the British to embarrass us , was also far less scrupulous than Queen Victoria 's ministers in observing the obligations of a neutral . Napoleon III , that prince of adven- NMapexicole ? " o and turers , tried in vain to get Great Britain and Russia to join him in forcing the United States to agree to an armistice . He encouraged the extreme pro-Southern advocates in the British Parliament . He gave audiences to Jefferson Davis 's special envoy , Slidell , permitting him to have ships built for the Confederacy at Bordeaux and Nantes , provided their destination was kept secret . He was instrumental in floating the only considerable Confederate loan in Europe ( see page 404 ) .

In the autumn of 1861 Great Britain , France , and Spain agreed on a joint expedition to Mexico to force the payment of her debts to them and the better protection of their citizens . Great Britain and Spain withdrew their fleets in the spring of 1862 , but Napoleon , desiring to complete his uncle 's abandoned project of restoring the prestige of the Latin peoples in the Western Hemisphere , set up a state to his own liking in Mexico .

The administration refused to be stampeded into a war with France over the application of the Monroe Doctrine . As soon as Lee had surrendered to Grant , however , General Sheridan was sent to the Texas border as a warning that the forbearance of the United States respecting this flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the Mexican Republic was at an end .

As they surveyed the scene , the prostration of their section appeared complete . The devastated areas were a constant reminder of the economic and social ruin wrought by the war . Virginia was deeply scarred by the campaigns against Richmond . The beautiful garden of the Shenandoah valley had been transformed into a desert waste . Across Georgia and the Carolinas Sherman 's army had cut a swath of destruction so complete that the task of restoration seemed hopeless . From the Potomac to the Rio Grande the countryside was dotted with burned farmhouses , demolished bridges , and plundered villages . In the larger towns were the same scenes of desolation ? partially burned business blocks , vacant houses , rotting wharves , and grass-grown streets . Commercial activity was almost at a standstill . In large areas the transportation system had completely collapsed . Rolling stock had disappeared , rails had been torn up , the very roadbeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread ruin the Southerners faced other problems quite as serious . The emancipation of the slaves , valued at something more than two billion dollars , meant not merely a financial loss to the planter class . It involved , first , the necessity of reorganizing the economic life of the South on the basis of free labor , and , second , the responsibility of adjusting the freedmen to the social obligations of their new status . Furthermore , the vanishing value of Confederate bonds and notes left the former planter aristocracy either poverty-stricken or land-poor . The problem of securing capital and labor with which to bring neglected acres back to productivity was an insistent one . Finally , those who had once dominated Southern politics , as they had guided its economic development , were anxiously concerned over the political reorganization of the state governments and their restoration to normal relations with the other states of the Union . Left to their own counsels and resources , the Southern leaders would have found these problems difficult enough of solution . Their task took on the characteristics of tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of post-war problems which could be carried out only at the point of Northern bayonets . How the program of political reconstruction developed from the presidential purpose of getting the prostrate states back into the Union with the least friction into the congressional plan of chastising those states by imposing humiliating terms for readmission is an important chapter in the history of the reunited nation . President Lincoln , as we have noted ( p. 401 ) , had offered to recognize in any of the states a government based on the oath of fealty of 10 per cent of the men who were voters at the time of the state 's secession . He had refused to sign the Davis-Wade Bill because it would have interfered with his policy of clemency . Denying the validity of the secession ordinances as state enactments , and regarding the defection of the South as a great rebellion against national authority , Lincoln insisted that executive pardon , based on proper guaranties of future loyalty and conditioned on the  | acceptance of the abolition of slavery , was the proper way of restoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way he was proceeding when the assassin 's bullet struck him down . The immense burden of Lincoln 's uncompleted task fell upon the inadequate shoulders of Andrew Johnson of Tennessee . He had been put on the Union Republican ticket of 1864 , partly to reward him for his stanch loyalty during the war and partly to relieve the Republicans from the odium of being a purely sectional party . At heart Johnson was a states ' - rights Democrat , but his love for the Union and his hatred of the slaveholders had brought him into the Republican camp . He was wont to boast that , since his election as alderman of Greenville , Tennessee , at the age of twenty , he had spent over thirty-five years in practical politics as mayor , member of his state legislature , governor of Tennessee for two terms , representative and senator in the national Congress , and military governor of his state under Lincoln 's appointment . Still , the handicap of an illiterate youth in crude surroundings had never been overcome . Though he was wise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactless in his relations with his fellows and excessively proud of his own accomplishments . His essential coarseness of fiber , his fatal faculty for doing even the right thing in the wrong way , chill the approval which we would fain give to his policies . Johnson believed , as did Lincoln , that the political restoration of the South was a subject for executive action alone . With the support of his cabinet officers , all of whom had been invited to retain their portfolios on Lincoln 's death , he proceeded during the summer of 1865 to formulate his policy without summoning Congress in extra session . On May 29 he issued a proclamation granting amnesty to those persons formerly engaged in rebellion against the authority of the United States , on condition of their taking an oath to " support , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the states thereunder , " and to bide by all the laws and proclamations made during the war in reference to the emancipation of the slaves . Certain classes ?  | including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Confederacy , men who had left their seats in Congress or on the bench or their posts in the United States army or navy to serve " the pretended government " of the Confederacy , the governors of the seceded states , and secessionists owning property taxed above $20,000 were excluded from the benefits of the proclamation . Before the end of July provisional governors had been appointed for all the seceding states in which Lincoln had not inaugurated loyal governments ; namely , North Carolina , Mississippi , Georgia , Texas , Alabama , South Carolina , and Florida . Under the direction of the provisional governors conventions were called in all the states ( except Texas ) , constitutions were framed , legislatures were elected , the ordinances of secession were repealed or annulled ( except in Mississippi ) , the Confederate debt was repudiated ( except in South Carolina ) , and senators and representatives were chosen for the ensuing session of Congress . In reality the fate of the " Johnson governments " depended upon the attitude of Congress toward seating the members sent up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , 1865 , the packed galleries of the House followed with intense interest the roll call of the states , but they heard not the name of a single state of the late Confederacy . Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania , who had instructed the clerk of the House to make this omission , promptly moved that a joint committee of nine members of the House and six members of the Senate be appointed : to inquire into the con .. dition of the states which formed the so-called Confederate States of America , and report whether they or any of them are entitled to be represented in either House of Congress . " The ? motion was carried by a vote of 129 to 35 . The next day the Senate also agreed to ignore the work of Johnson and Lincoln , and to begin the reconstruction of the South de novo . The reasons for this momentous decision were many and various . In the first place , Congress felt that the time had arrived to redress the balance between the executive and the legislature which had been disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The adjust-  | ment of the relations of the states to the Union , it maintained , was the business of Congress and not of the President . Fur thermore , certain radical members of Congress , under the leadership of Stevens , insisted that no punishment was too severe for the crime of rebellion and that the " unrepentant South " should be treated as a " conquered province . " These sindictives " joined forces with Charles Sumner of Massachusetts , an uncompromising theorist obsessed with the humanitarian doctrine of the equal virtues and capacities of black men and white , and therefore insistent upon frill politi -- cal and civil rights for the Negro ? Lin the South . Stevens abhorred the program of the President chiefly because it let the South off too easily ; Sumner , because it did not include Negro suffrage . Partisanship , also , entered into the congres- , 6 sional decision . The abolition of slavery had annulled theta/74 three-fifths rule of the Constitution , and henceforth the rep- t resentation of a state in the House would be based on its total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatly enlarged Southern delegation , which would obviously be Democratic , might unite with Northern Democrats to endanger the results of the war or to oust the Republicans from power . Consequently , the practical politicians among the Republicans advised caution in receiving the representatives from the Southern states . After all , the party that saved the Union must rule it ! But it was not merely political theory , personal animosity , or partisan anxiety that determined the course of Congress in December , 1865 . The actions of the Johnson governments themselves contributed much to their repudiation . In the first place , they had purposely sent to Washington , as prospective senators and representatives , men who had been prominent in the civil and military affairs of the Confederacy . The Georgia legislature even chose Alexander H. Stephens as United States senator . In the second place , the new legislatures , especially in those states where the number of Negroes exceeded or equaled the white population , " d passed laws , designated as Vagrancy Acts , Apprentice ricts , and LaborControl Acts , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the Negroes from insolent abuse of their freedom . Although these black codes ' conferred some benefits on the Negro in the matter of protecting his property rights and his privilege to testify in court in cases in which the members of his race were concerned , they were condemned in the North as attempts to reduce the Negro again to slavery . Finally , the case of the South was further prejudiced by scores of incidents , some serious , some trivial . The inevitable clashes between blacks and whites were often magnified into horrible Negro massacres . The defiant assertions of a people smarting under defeat that they " had nothing to repent of " were reported in Northern newspapers as evidence of continued disloyalty . Official and unofficial observers insisted that the South was in a hostile mood and its every act must be watched . While the Joint Committee on Reconstruction was listening to testimony and working out its plans , a bitter quarrel between President Johnson and the congressional " radicals " broke out . In February , 1866 , Congress passed a law to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bureau , an organization created in 1865 to protect the newly emancipated Negroes . Although the head of the bureau , General O. O. Howard , was a conservative official , many of the agents were rascals who took advantage of the Negro 's gullibility by selling him painted pegs with which to stake out claims on his former master 's estate and promising him " forty acres and a mule " at Christmas . President Johnson vetoed the bill on the grounds that it entailed needless expense , was an unconstitutional extension of Federal control over the domestic concerns of the states , and would make the Negroes either wards of the nation or victims of unscrupulous adventurers . When the Senate failed to pass the bill over Johnson 's veto , it seemed as if the President held sufficient power to restrain the radicals . But he failed to take advantage of his victory . Instead of conferring with the moderate leaders in Congress and uniting them in support of his policy , he permitted his penchant for controversy to lead him into undignified attacks upon his opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to the White House on Washing-  | ton 's Birthday to commend the veto of the Freedmen 's Bureau Bill , the President replied in a most unhappy vein . Egged on by prompting voices from the crowd , he forgot all sense of decorum and delivered a " stump speech " in which he denounced Stevens and Sumner by name , declared t hat threats of assassination would not swerve him from his duty , and boasted inordinately both of his exalted statesmanship and of his lowly origin . Thereafter his chance of controlling a third of the members of Congress was gone . A Civil Rights Bill , conferring the privileges of citizenship upon the Negroes , was passed over his veto . The Freedmen 's Bureau Bill was revived and likewise passed over his veto . A constitutional amendment , reported from Stevens 's joint committee in April , 1866 , was quickly passed with the required two-thirds majority . This Fourteenth Amendment declared that every person horn or naturalized in this country was a citizen of the United States and of the state in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privileges of that citizenship . It penalized any state that should deprive the Negro of the suffrage , by cutting down its representation in the House in just the proportion that the number of disfranchised adult males bore to the total number of adult males in the state . It excluded from seats in either house of Congress and from national and state offices all persons who , having taken an oath to support t h e Constitution of the United States , had thereafter engaged in rebellion against its authority or given aid or comfort to the Confederate cause ; but it provided that these disabilities could be removed by a two-thirds vote of Congress . And , finally , it affirmed the validity of the United States debt and forbade the payment of the Confederate debt either by the nation or by any of the states of the secession . Although Congress made no promise to readmit the Southern states to the Union if they ratified the amendment , it actually did readmit Tennessee when that state rat ' d in the summer of 1866 . The ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majorities . Thus passed the second opportunity for a peaceful and orderly restoration of the Southern states .  | While the South was compassing the defeat of the amendnt , in the autumn of 1866 , a stirring campaign was being ged in the North between the radicals and the moderates the control of the Fortieth Congress . Johnson welcomed chance to appeal to the voters for a decision of the issue tween himself and the radicals . Invited to participate in dedication of a monument to Stephen A. Douglas in Licago , the President converted the trip into a campaign 1r as far as St. Louis . This " swinging round the circle " abled him to boast of his devotion to the Constitution and attack the " Northern traitors " as " foul whelps of sin " Lo were seeking to break up the Union . He bandied arguants and insults with the crowds that gathered round the ttform of his car to spur him on or to hiss and hoot him th cries of " Traitor ! " " Renegade !

The elections in November returned 143 Repubans , with few exceptions opponents of the President , and Democrats to Congress . Andrew Johnson was " reduced a cypher " in the government . As the short session of the Thirty-ninth Congress convened December , 1866 , Thaddeus Stevens raised a laugh by remarking , " I was a conservative in the last session of Congress , but I mean to be a radical henceforth . " He kept his promise . Before session closed he managed to push through Congress over President 's veto ( March 2 , 1867 ) a genuinely drastic : construction Act . It divided the former Confederate states ccept Tennessee ) into five military districts with a general the United States army in command of each . Under the - ection of these military chiefs , conventions were to be mmoned in the ten states , the Negroes were to be registered voters , and the whites who were disqualified by the Four:nth Amendment were to be excluded from the polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Negro suffrage , when these constitutions should ve been ratified in the states and accepted by Congress ,  | when the legislatures elected under them should have adopted the Fourteenth Amendment , and that amendment should have secured the indorsement of three fourths of the states of the Union , then the Southern states might be restored to representation in Congress.l Supplementary acts gave the generals complete control of registration and the power of removing all civil officers , state and municipal , within their spheres of command , subject only to the veto of the general of the army ( Grant ) . The Reconstruction Acts created governments in the South which were a sad travesty on republican institutions . In South Carolina , Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , and Louisiana the Negroes , without a trace of political education or experience , composed a majority of the registered voters . In the other states they were a large minority . More than seven eighths of them could neither read nor write .

Ninety-one of the members paid no taxes . In Alabama the members of the legislature paid altogether less than $100 in taxes . Clerks , supervisors , judges , and a host of other officials in town and county were elected who " could not perform the smallest operation in arithmetic or correctly spell three words in succession . " The sprinkling of competent and respected whites in the legislatures were unable to hold in check the combination of mercenary carpetbaggers , unprincipled scalawags , and gullible Negroes , who entered upon an orgy of extravagance and fraud , piling up an intolerable burden of debt , squandering millions in thieving contracts , and sapping such recuperative power as was left to the South after the exhausting shock of war .

For a decade it delayed the single-minded devotion of the South to the pressing problems of economic rehabilitation . It deferred for a generation the reconciliation of the sections . Though President Johnson had been reduced to political impotence , his enemies were not content . His impeachment and removal became for them a " political necessity . " Zealous as they were in ferreting out every clue , the radicals in the House found it difficult to secure an indictment against the President for " treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors .

" Scalawag " denoted the Southern whites who sought political preferment by supporting the radical reconstruction policy .  | denying to Johnson a privilege exercised by every president since Washington . If the congressional leaders hoped that Johnson would be tempted to disobey the act , they were not disappointed . During the recess of Congress , in August , 1867 , the President asked Secretary of War Stanton , who was " virtually a spy " in the cabinet , to resign . On the advice of the radical leaders Stanton refused in a curt and insolent note . Then Johnson suspended him and appointed General Grant Secretary of War ad interim . When Congress reassembled , the Senate refused to acquiesce in the suspension of Stanton , and Grant immediately relinquished the office to him , whereupon Johnson dismissed Stanton in spite of the Tenure-of-Office Act and named General Lorenzo Thomas in his place . A series of scenes followed , worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair was that Stanton held the fort , and the House immediately voted to impeach the President . The trial before the Senate , acting as court and jury , under the presidency of Chief Justice Chase , was opened on March 4 , and the final vote was taken on May 26 , 1868 . Of the eleven charges only the last one , accusing the President of violating the Tenure-of-Office Act , formed a plausible basis for impeachment . On this point Johnson 's able counsel showed , first , that the President 's motive in dismissing Stanton had been to bring the constitutionality of the law before the courts , and , secondly , that it was extremely doubtful whether the act applied to the relations between Johnson and Stanton at all . For the act protected cabinet officers from removal " during the term of the President by whom they had been appointed , " and Stanton had been appointed by Lincoln . But the implacable managers of the prosecution , led by Butler , Stevens , and Logan , made the trial " a party caucus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacobins of the French Revolution , they urged the tribunal to punish the self-convicted traitor rather than to try the privileged defendant . " Tyrant , " " criminal , " " apostate , " " usurper , " were some of the epithets descriptive of Johnson , who was to be " hurled from the White House and consigned once more to the fond embraces of his rebel confederates in the South  | and their faithful allies in the North . " In spite of brazen attempts to browbeat doubtful senators , the radicals could not muster the two-thirds vote ( 36 ) necessary for conviction . When the roll was called on the crucial article in the House charges , seven Republicans joined the twelve Democrats in voting " not guilty . " Thus the President was acquitted by one vote , 35 to 19 . The radicals retired from the field in defeat . Stanton withdrew from the War Depart nun ' , and the Senate promptly ratified the appointment of ( ; metal John M. Schofield as his successor . Throughout the North there was momentary disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved from an indefensible prostitution of the constitutional safeguard of impeachment to the ends of political vengeance . Four days after the first vote on the impeachment articles the National Union Republican convention met in Chicago ( May 20 ) and unanimously nominated General Grant for the presidency , with Schuyler Colfax , Speaker of the House , for his runningmate . The platform condemned Andrew Johnson , indorsed the radical program of reconstruction , denounced the repudiation of the national debt , and declared that while the regulation of the suffrage in the states of the secession belonged to Congress , in the loyal states it should be left to the people . The Democrats , who gathered at Tammany Hall , New York , on July 4 , were not content to rest their case on their opposition to the " unconstitutional and revolutionary " Reconstruction Acts . At the insistence of General George H. Pendleton of Ohio they included in their platform the " Ohio idea , " namely , that the government bonds , whenever legally possible , should be redeemed in " lawful money " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same currency for the bondholder and the p .. , ugh-holder " the Western delegations tried to swing the convention to Pendleton , but after twenty-two ballots the delegates stampeded to Governor Horatio Seymour of New York . Francis P. Blair of Missouri was nominated for vice president . As Seymour repudiated the " greenback plank , " the Democratic campaign consisted of a vigorous defense of  | the party 's record during the war and a scathing denunciation of the reconstruction program of 1867 . Grant won a decisive victory over Seymour in the electoral vote ( 214 to 80 ) , carrying every state of the North and West except New York , New Jersey , and Oregon , and every reconstructed state of the South except Georgia and Louisiana . When the Republican politicians came to analyze the election more carefully , however , they realized how necessary the Negro vote was for the perpetuation of their power . Without the 650,000 Negro ballots cast for him in the South , the popular war hero would not have had a majority at the polls . The radical Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of a Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution , forbidding the United States or any state to deny the right of voting to any citizen on account of " race , color , or previous condition of servitude . " This amendment , which passed Congress early in 1869 , satisfied the theorists who wanted Negro suffrage as a matter of " principle , " the vindictives who thought no punishment too severe for the sin of secession , and the practical politicians who wished to secure the Negro vote to assure the dominance of the Republican party . Six days after the passage of the amendment Johnson 's troubled administration came to an end , and the hero of Appomattox moved into the White House . PROBLEMS OF PROSPEROUS YEARS Reconstruction , in its broadest sense , covers a great number of political and social readjustments necessitated by the Civil War . That conflict settled three questions which had divided counsels ever since the foundation of the republic . It forever abolished slavery ; it firmly cemented the Union ; and it definitely established the supremacy of the national government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war raised new questions quite as momentous as those which it settled . A destitute South awaited rehabilitation , a national debt of $2,846,000,000 compelled the government to collect  | taxes amounting to $11.46 in gold for every person in the country . A tenfold increase in the volume of paper money resulted in the doubling of pre-war prices . Gold , which was relatively scarce , became an object of speculation instead of a standard of value . The code of business ethics was debased by conscienceless profiteers who sold the government . shoddy blankets and paper-soled shoes , and by shameless promoters who robbed the people through the sale of fraudulent , securities . The extravagance and vulgar display of the new-rich caused a regrettable lowering of the standards of popular taste . Finally , diplomatic controversies with France and Great Britain loomed portentously . While the war destroyed the economic basis of the slaveowning aristocracy , it assured the prosperity of Northern industrialists . " The truth is , " wrote Senator Sherman of Ohio , in the autumn of 1865 , close of the war with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of leading capitalists , far higher than anything ever undertaken in this country before . They talk of millions as confidently as formerly of thousands . " The war was floated in the Northern states on this rising tide of prosperity . To be sure , the cotton industry was temporarily crippled , and the merchant marine , which in 1853 had surpassed Great Britain 's , was ruined by the depredations of Confederate cruisers . On the other hand , the war demands of the government for blankets , horses , and munitions created an unprecedented market . Shoe factories , textile mills , and iron foundries , through increased output , kept pace with the bumper crops of the farms , while the discovery of oil wells in western Pennsylvania and veins of precious metals in the Rocky Mountain belt added spectacular and speculative elements to the industrial boom . The rapid growth of our national wealth during the quarter-century succeeding the Civil War was based upon the agricultural and mineral resources of the trans-Mississippi country . This magnificent domain , once the prize for which the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to farmers , miners , ranchers , and lumbermen . Con-  | gress enacted during the war a series of measures which set the stage for the exploitation of this domain . In the first place , the political map of the region was laid out on the same lines that it retains today . When Abraham Lincoln was elected president , Texas , California , and Oregon were the only states west of the Missouri River . In 1861 Kansas was admitted to the Union , the vast area of Nebraska north of 43 ? was erected into the Territory of Dakota , and the eastern and western portions of Utah became the Territories of Colorado and Nevada respectively . In 1863 the western half of New Mexico was made into the Territory of Arizona , and a new Territory of Idaho was formed from the western part of Dakota and the eastern part of the old Oregon region . In 1864 Nevada was admitted as a state , while the region between Idaho and the Dakotas was erected into the Territory of Montana . Save for the Territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1889 ) , all the boundary lines west of the Missouri were drawn before the close of Lincoln 's first term ( see maP , P. 435 ) . This vast Western domain was made " free " territory , in both senses of the word , by congressional legislation . It was forever closed to slavery by the act of June 19 , 1862 , and it was opened gratis to settlers by the Homestead Act of May 20 , 1862 . The policy of the government in the disposal of its public lands had always been generous , but the Homestead Act permitted the settler , if he cultivated his land five years , to secure full title to his 160-acre farm on the payment of a $10 registration fee . Such generosity was prompted by the desire to see the great West settled and by the conviction that the supply of public land would last for generations , if not for centuries . ' The unoccupied national domain still included more than 1,000,000,000 acres ? an area equal to footnote ' President Johnson thought that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied .

"  | half the United States and capable , if populated as densely as Europe , of supporting about 600,000,000 people . At the close of the Civil War the prevailing high prices , the demobilizing of the armies , the renewal of immigration , ' and the government 's encouragement of the trans-Missouri railroads all led to an eager rush for the West . Traffic west of the Missouri increased fourfold between 1863 and the close of the war , while millions of dollars were invested in the overland transportation business . During the three years following the war the amount of land granted under the Homestead Act alone rose from 1,160,000 to 2,302,923 acres , while the grants for railroads , agricultural and industrial colleges , public schools , soldiers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total annual distribution of the public lands to approximately 6,000,000 acres . By far the largest item in the government 's liberality was the aid in lands and money granted to the projected Western railroads . In the decade preceding the war the opposition of the South to further expenditures by the Federal government for the development of free territory had thwarted the project for a Pacific railroad as it had postponed the act for the free allotment of homesteads . On the withdrawal of the Southern members , however , Congress in 1862 incorporated the Union Pacific Railroad Company to construct a line from the western boundary of Iowa to a point where it should - eet the Central Pacific , building eastward from Sacramento , California . Half the public lands in a strip ten miles wide on both sides of the road were given to the companies , in addition to a subsidy of $16,000 in 6 per cent bonds for every mile of track completed .

But in spite of further favors granted by the government in July , 1864,1 capital was slow in seeking an investment whose returns seemed so remote and uncertain when hundreds of men were making a fortune overnight in oil or metals . Even after the first rail was laid , in 1865 , many sensible people insisted that it would be impossible to build a railroad across the desert wilderness and over the towering mountain ranges .

Though their methods of awarding contracts , which were exceedingly costly to the railroad , could not be defended , Ames and his associates rendered a considerable service in completing the transcontinental line seven years before the date set by Congress . The construction gangs working westward from Omaha and eastward from Sacramento met at Promontory Point , near Ogden , Utah , where the last rail was fastened with spikes of silver and gold on May 10 , 1869 . Wires connected with the silver sledge-hammer carried the welcome sound of the alternate strokes of President Stanford of the Central Pacific and Vice President Durant of the Union Pacific to telegraph offices all over the land .

As the buffalo herds were destroyed by amateur sportsmen and professional hunters , many of the tribes , having lost their chief source of food and clothing , were driven to a desperate resistance . Dishonest agents of the Indian Bureau sold the savages whisky and firearms , which made the task of the soldiers , who were trying to restrain ambush and massacres , almost impossible .

In 1871 the government ceased to treat the tribes as independent nations with treaty-making powers , and adopted a policy of regarding them as wards of the nation .

The Kansas Pacific , the Southern Pacific , the Northern Pacific , and the Gulf and Pacific not only pushed westward but also built branch lines , or " feeders , " piercing the trans-Missouri country in every direction . These roads , and a score of others , served the miners of the Rockies and the farmers of the Missouri valley . Between the farming and mining ontiers they tapped the vast grassy plains , where the Indian nunting-grounds were becoming cattle ranges .

Texas remained the chief breeding ground of the rapidly growing herds , but the Northern ranges , from Kansas to Montana , offered more nutritious pasturage . Each spring the cowboys starting on the " long drive " took hundreds of Texas herds northward to grow fat on the open ranges before being sold to cattle-dealers at the cow towns . It was an enterprise of adventure , filling the records of the Western ranches with many an exciting and colorful episode . The heyday of the cowboys , the round-up , the drives , the free range , and the cow towns came in the  | decade of the seventies , when more than four million beeves were driven up to join the herds bred on the Northern ranges .

Part of the new wealth was the result of honest toil and the legitimate expansion of business among enterprising people , but far too much of it was fictitious and fugitive . Speculation in railroads , metals , and oil 2 had introduced a spirit of reckless gambling into business enterprises . The transactions of the stock exchange far outran the balance sheets of the merchants and manufacturers .

In this program of buoyant industry the prostrate South had no part . It was absorbed in the all-important problem of dealing with the social and political status southern of the Negro . Voluntary associations , known Attacks on as White Leagues , Knights of the White Reconstruction Camelia , Boys of ' 76 , etc. , took upon themselves the duty of maintaining the supremacy of the white race , threatened , in the opinion of most Southerners , by the congressional policy of reconstruction . Of these associations the most important was the Ku-Klux Klan ( from the Greek kuklos , meaning " a circle " ) , which was organized by a group of young men at Pulaski , Tennessee , in 1866 , more in a spirit of fun-making than with any purpose of terrorism . Its leaders took advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of wholesome awe and deter them from cooperating with the carpetbaggers and scalawags in political activities . Troops of horsemen , with steed and rider robed in white sheets , would appear suddenly to break up Negro meetings , or a solitary rider would stop at night at a Negro 's cabin , and , calling for water , would pour a pailful or two down his neck into a rubber bag concealed beneath his disguise , casually remarking that he had not had a drink since he dug his way up from hell through the battlefield of Shiloh . The Klan spread rapidly over the South , organized as the Invisible Empire , with an elaborate hierarchy of officials ( Genii , Dragons , Hydras , Furies , and Goblins ) , reaching from the Cyclops of the local den up to the Grand Wizard of the Empire . As the Negroes , under the leadership of the carpetbaggers , were drawn into political activities through the Union Leagues of the South , the Ku-Klux methods grew sterner , Klan members frequently resorting to violence and brutality . Stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes came to the North with increasing fullness of detail , and roused emphatic protests . Congressional resentment flared higher as it became clear that state after state in the South  | was returning to white control and deserting the Republican party . In order to safeguard Negro suffrage , which had been guaranteed in the Fifteenth Amendment , an act was passed by Congress in May , 1870 , visiting with severe penalties any infraction of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments ; but the effect was only to redouble the activities of the Ku-Klux Klan and other " regulative associations . " In February , 1871 , a second Enforcement Act placed congressional elections under the control of supervisors appointed by Federal judges in the various states . This was followed in April by the famous Ku-Klux Act , which gave the President military powers for the suppression of the Ku-Klux outrages . In conformity with this legislation , Grant , in the autumn of 1871 , suspended the writ of Habeas Corpus in nine counties of South Carolina .

Trumbull of Illinois and Schurz of Missouri opposed the Ku-Klux Bill in the Senate .

But reconstruction at the point of the bayonet was only one of the counts in the rising hostility to the administration as Grant 's first term wore on . Few footnote i The Ku-Klux Act and several sections of the Enforcement Acts were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1875 . It may be said , in general , that the reconstruction policy of Congress was carried out with as little regard for the judicial as for the executive branch of the government .

Nevertheless Congress proceeded , by the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 , to " invest brigadier generals with power to abolish jury trials and to suspend the privilege of Habeas Corpus in time of peace .

He was the most popular man in the country , sharing with the martyred Lincoln the gratitude of millions for the preservation of the Union .

Although his own integrity was never questioned , Grant often failed to detect the shortcomings of public officials for whose conduct he was ultimately responsible . His inestimable services in the war for the Union can not be used as an excuse for his inability to remedy , or even to realize fully , the abuses which made the years of his presidency one of the most deplorable periods in our history . His failures , as he confessed in his last message to Congress , were " errors of judgment , not of intent . " Still , the American people have the right to expect rectitude of judgment as well as honesty of purpose in their chief magistrate . Tacitus 's terse comment on the Emperor Galba might have been written for Grant : " capax imperi , nisi imperasset .

A few months later the Secretary of the Interior , Jacob D. Cox of Ohio , sent in his resignation because the President would not support him in his fight to keep the Indian Bureau out of politics . The departure of Hoar and Cox left Hamilton Fish of New York , Secretary of State , as the only strong influence in the cabinet .  | Finally , Grant 's undisguised admiration for men of wealth had brought his name into an unfortunate connection with one of the most unsavory transactions of the period . Jim Fisk and Jay Gould , a pair of unscrupulous stockbrokers , conspired to corner the nation 's gold supply in the summer of 1869 .

So guileless was the President that he furthered their conspiracy by instructing Secretary Boutwell to make no further sales of gold without his permission . As the price of gold rose , legitimate business found it hard to secure the metal in which certain of its obligations had to be met . Grant became suspicious of the motives of Gould and Fisk and again gave his Secretary free hand to sell . Boutwell immediately threw $4,000,000 of the Treasury 's gold on the market . But Gould , having learned through Corbin of the President 's change of mind , began to unload his $50,000,000 of gold without taking his partner into his confidence . The unsuspecting Fisk bid the price up to 162 before the crash came . Wall Street became the scene of wild speculation and wilder confusion , as Gould poured his millions on the market and the Treasury 's sale of its surplus completed the destruction of the corner . This hectic day of Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokers down to ruin , is known as " Black Friday . " Though Grant was innocent in the affair , he had accepted the hospitality of Gould and Fisk and had appeared with his wife and daughter in Fisk 's box at the theater . Furthermore , the President 's brother-in-law and sister were deeply involved in the conspiracy . Naturally , Grant could not stand forth , as he should have done , as the nation 's leader in the protest against the low state of public morality which " Black Friday " symbolized . Protest , however , was not long delayed . It took the form of an anti-Grant movement within the Republican party , and its leaders called themselves " Liberal Republicans . " Missouri  | was the rallying point for the dissatisfaction with the administration . In 1870 those Republicans of the state who favored a more liberal policy toward the former secessionists won a decided victory at the polls , electing B. Gratz Brown governor and Carl Schurz United States senator . Since their success implied criticism of the congressional reconstruction policy , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's renomination could not be prevented , the Missouri Liberals issued a call for a national convention to meet at Cincinnati on May 1 , 1872 . This gathering proved to be a strange mingling of idealistic reformers , shrewd politicians , and indefatigable " cranks . " Its influential leaders strove to reconcile " many men of many minds " and drafted a platform which denounced corruption in high places , declared Grant unfit for the presidency , advocated general amnesty for the South , indorsed civil-service reform , and recommended referring the revision of the tariff to the voters . But whatever chance the Liberals may have had of defeating the organized forces of the administration was lost when the Cincinnati convention nominated Horace Greeley , famous editor of the New York Tribune , for president , with Governor Brown of Missouri for vice president . Greeley has well been called " a preposterous candidate . " His defects of temperament were well known , and his long career in politics and journalism had earned him a host of enemies .

But the electorate was greatly amused at the discomfiture of a party compelled to indorse a candidate who for years had been pouring his choicest vocabulary of invective upon the Democrats as " horse thieves " and " rebels . " In  | a campaign of unusual vituperation the result was a foregone conclusion . Greeley 's defeat was crushing . He carried only three border states ( Maryland , Kentucky , and Missouri ) and three of the states of the former Confederacy ( Georgia , Tennessee , and Texas ) , giving him 66 electoral votes to 272 for Grant .

Indeed , the whole diplomatic history of the years immediately following the war stands in pleasant contrast to the record of confusion and controversy over domestic issues . There are two aspects to that history . In part it is a chapter of the long " continued story " of American expansion . In part it is a chapter of reconstruction in the broader sense of that word ; namely , the adjustment of all the difficulties and complications that grew out of the four years of conflict . The heavy responsibilities of the war years did not prevent Secretary Seward from displaying a lively concern over American interests in the Far East . He became convinced that the acquisition of Alaska was a necessary prelude to the emergence of the United States as a power in the Pacific . It was with joy , therefore , that he received from the Russian Czar in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain east of Bering Sea .

It probably influenced Grant to recommend reforms in the tariff , the public-land administration , the civil service , and the coercive policy toward the South . It certainly stimulated Congress to pass a General Amnesty Act in May , 1872.  | larger than that of the thirteen original states of the Union . ' Seward won the powerful support of Charles Sumner , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , who believed in the manifest destiny of our republic to spread from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean ; and the treaty was ratified on April 9 with only two dissenting votes . There was much opposition to the treaty , however , in the press , and a determined attack on it in the House debate over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an enormous war debt and vexed with a disordered currency to spend $7,200,000 for a " dreary waste of glaciers , icebergs , white bears , and walruses " was the height of folly . If these critics who referred contemptuously to " Seward 's ice box " could have foreseen that by the close of the century Alaska would have yielded nearly $150,000,000 of wealth , while her timber resources remained virtually untouched , they would have called the land Seward 's treasure box . From the frozen North Seward turned to the Tropics , where he tried to promote American expansion . Six months after the purchase of Alaska he negotiated a treaty for the purchase of the Virgin Islands from Denmark , but the treaty was not reported until 1870 , when it was rejected by the Senate.2 Even less consideration was accorded his treaty for the acquisition of Samana Bay in Santo Domingo as a naval base .

" Those expenses were $5,800,000 , and they were paid by adding this sum to the original purchase price of $1,400,000 for Alaska . ( See " Letters of Franklin K. Lane , " pp. 260-261. ) 2 On the occasion of our entrance into the World War , in April , 1917 , we had vital interests to protect in the Panama Canal Zone and the Caribbean area , and we purchased these islands from Denmark for $25,000,000.  | Secretary of State with the matter by the casual introduction of the treaty at a cabinet meeting .

He secured the appointment of a commission which visited the island and reported in favor of annexation , but Grant now realized that ratification of the treaty was an impossibility and abandoned the project . The reconstruction phase of our foreign relations included diplomatic difficulties with both France and Great Britain . The action of Napoleon III in placing the Austrian archduke Maximilian upon an imperial throne in Mexico in 1864 ( p. 414 ) was doubly offensive to the United States , because it clearly violated the Monroe Doctrine by subverting the republican form of government in Mexico , and because Maximilian gave aid and comfort to the Confederacy by allowing ammunition and supplies to reach Texas across the Rio Grande . President Lincoln had frequently discussed with General Grant plans for driving the French army out of Mexico at the close of the war . When that moment came , Grant stationed Sheridan on the Mexican border with fifty-two thousand men and made plans to cooperate with the dispossessed Mexican president , Benito Juarez . But Seward , believing that Napoleon would yield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notes which ended in an ultimatum in March , 1866 . Meanwhile Napoleon had grown sick of his Mexican enterprise . Its cost was excessive , and it provoked the bitter attacks of the Republicans in the French Chamber . Furthermore , Napoleon was disturbed by the menace to France of Prussia 's emergence as leader of the German states . He abandoned Maximilian as readily as he had taken him up , ordering General Bazaine to send home the French troops . Maximilian 's beautiful consort , Carlotta , crossed the Atlantic to plead her husband 's cause with Napoleon , with her brother Leopold II of Belgium , and with the Pope ? all in vain . She lost both her entreaties and her reason . Prussia 's decisive  | victory over Austria in the battle of Koniggratz merely hastened the recall of the French troops , the last regiments leaving Mexico in March , 1867 . Maximilian could have gone with them , but he stubbornly refused to " abandon " his Mexican subjects . He was captured by Juarez 's soldiers , and , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shot ( June 19 , 1867 ) . Seward meanwhile was cautiously feeling his way toward a settlement with Great Britain for the damages done to the commerce of the United States during the Civil War by the Alabama and other Confederate cruisers built in British shipyards . At first the British ministers refused to admit that our claims were " founded on any grounds of law or justice . " They had acted strictly in accordance with the laws of the realm , and " used all means in their power to prevent the fitting out and arming of vessels in their ports to cruise against the vessels of the United States . " But with the rise of Prussia 's military power , the British government , fearing a general European war , concluded that it would be most annoying to have neutral maritime nations let forth " a swarm of Alabamas " to vex its own commerce . Lord Derby , therefore , encouraged the negotiations which resulted in January , 1869 , in the agreement between Reverdy Johnson , American minister to the Court of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which contained no mention of the Alabama , inerely'provided for a general reference to arbitration of any claims that the two countries might have against each other since their last negotiation in 1853 . On April 13 , 1869 , the Senate rejected the convention by a vote of 54 to 1 . This decisive action followed upon a speech by Charles Sumner of the Foreign Relations Committee , in which the " massive grievance " of the United States was set forth without moderation . Sumner presented Great Britain with a staggering bill of $2,110,000,000 for " indirect damages " caused by the prolongation of the war as a result of the aid given to the Confederacy by the British authorities . Sumner 's speech , virtually demanding reparations payments from  | Great Britain , appealed to the people of the country as a cogent statement of our just complaint against a power which we had been long accustomed to regard as unfriendly to the United States . Of course it did not help the new Secretary of State , Hamilton Fish , toward an amicable settlement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subject , in view of the excited state of mind of the people on both sides of the Atlantic . The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War , the collapse of Napoleon III 's empire , and the siege of Paris in 1870 gave force to the words of those British statesmen who advocated an amicable arrangement with the United States , in view of the possible complications for Great Britain in the European situation . Secretary Fish seized the opportunity to incorporate in the President 's annual message ( December , 1870 ) a sharp warning that Congress might find it necessary to assume the individual claims of our citizens against Great Britain . With the British cabinet disposed to enter upon fresh negotiations , it was not difficult to arrange for the submission of the various matters in dispute ( the Alabama claims , the northwest boundary , the Newfoundland fisheries ) to a Joint High Commission . The Commission concluded the Treaty of Washington ( May 8 , 1871 ) , which provided that the Alabama claims should be adjudicated at Geneva , Switzerland , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , the queen of England , the king of Italy , the president of Switzerland , and the emperor of Brazil . Before the arguments of the two nations were ready to be presented to the tribunal , the United States was in the midst of an exciting presidential campaign ( 1872 ) . The Fenian movement of 1866 ? a protest against England 's coercive treatment of the Irish agitators for home rule ? had enlisted wide support among the Irish of this country , resulting in attempts at armed invasions of Canada from points in northern New York and Vermont . The Grant administration could not risk losing the large Irish vote by any " truckling " to Great Britain at Geneva . Moreover , a brilliant diplomatic victory over the British might offset the criticism of Grant 's  | vulnerable domestic record . These political considerations probably explain why our " case " at Geneva included the claims for " indirect damages " which Sumner had advanced three years before . Not until we had limited our demands to direct damages , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the damages inflicted by Confederate cruisers Great Britain was held responsible , and the United States was awarded $15,500,000 damages , to be paid in gold . The other matters under dispute were settled by special commissions . Great Britain received $1,929,819 for injuries done to the property or persons of her subjects during the Civil War and $5,500,000 for our infringement of her rights in the fisheries of the north Atlantic coast . ' The peaceful settlement of these claims and counterclaims was a long step forward ? the longest that either country had ever taken ? toward the substitution of frank discussion and " sweet reasonableness " for the appeal to arms in international disputes . POLITICAL CONVALESCENCE In spite of such relieving features as the Geneva Award and the General Amnesty Act of 1872 , the decade between the close of the Civil War and the centennial of our independence presents a dismal record of frenzied speculation , business demoralization , political corruption , and financial confusion .

' Just a fortnight before Grant was inaugurated for his second term ( March 4 , 1873 ) , the Poland Committee reported to Congress on the scandals connected with the building of the Union Pacific Railroad ( p. 434 ) .

This committee , in collusion with rascally plasterers , plumbers , pavers , builders , and furnishers , robbed the taxpayers of amounts variously estimated at from $45,000,000 to $200,000,000 before the proofs of their guilt were revealed to the New York Times by a disgruntled member of the gang . George Jones , the proprietor of the paper , was offered $5,000,000 to hush the matter up , but he published the documents . The chief offender , Tweed , ended his days in the Ludlow Street jail .

The committee recommended that the House of Representatives expel Ames and James Brooks of New York , a director of the Union Pacific .

But the genial Vice President , Schuyler Colfax , became involved in a mess of prevarication and evasion , and retired at the close of his term a thoroughly discredited man. , While the press was still informing the country of the disclosures in the Credit Mobilier scandal , Grant delivered his second inaugural address . He pledged himself to labor for the correction of abuses in the civil service , the rehabilitation of our currency upon a specie basis , and " the restoration of good feeling between the different sections of our common country .

" How " happy " the rehabilitation of the South was might be judged from the conditions in Louisiana .

Both footnote The Congress which had been laboring through the mire of the Credit Mobilier exposures did nothing to redeem its reputation when it passed a bill for generous increases in salaries ( March 3 , 1873 ) . Since that part of the act which raised the pay of the senators and representatives from $5000 to $7500 was retroactive , carrying a bonus of $5000 for each member of the expiring Congress , it was denounced as a " salary grab " and " back-pay steal .

Kellogg and John McEnery , the respective candidates for governor , claimed the victory , and two competing governments were set up . In spite of " frauds and forgeries " in the election , Grant immediately determined to use Federal troops to seize the statehouse and install the Kellogg government . Had it not been for this interference of the administration the McEnery government " would have been peacefully inaugurated , " and the people of Louisiana would have been spared two more years of anarchy including riots , massacres , and a second intervention of United States troops ? before a peaceful truce was arranged between the factions . Conditions in several other Southern states were only less distressful than in Louisiana . The Negroes in the Mississippi legislature increased from 36 in 1869 to 64 in 1873 , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections where the blacks outnumbered the whites , riots were frequent , at times developing into brutal massacres of the Negroes . Governor Ames , a carpetbagger from Maine , requested Federal troops in September , 1875 , but the President , with a belated appreciation of the folly of the policy of coercion , refused the request . The I ) emocrats , left with a free hand , carried the state in the November election of 1875 , by the drastic suppression of the Negro vote . In South Carolina , where actual riot and massacre were not so evident as in Louisiana and Mississippi , the general tone of public life was debased beyond belief . The state legislature , almost completely " Africanized , " enacted a travesty in popular government which would have been as ludicrous as a minstrel show had it not been so disastrous to the credit of the state . In a carnival of extravagance the lawmakers voted huge sums for fraudulent public contracts , for elaborate furnishings for the statehouse , and for a hundred other crazy objects , even to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that amount on a horse race . Governor Scott ( from Ohio ) plundered the state for four years , and he was succeeded by a notorious scalawag named Moses , who led his people into a deeper bondage of debt . To a Northern observer in 1873 the people of South Carolina seemed " gloomy , disconsolate , and  | hopeless , " feebly struggling to avert " complete confiscation . " The tide turned in 1874 with the election of Daniel H. Chamberlain of Massachusetts , who vetoed bills of plunder , appointed honest men to office , and labored for the restoration of good feeling between his native state and his adopted state . But South Carolina , like Louisiana and Florida , was not delivered from the rule of the carpetbagger until the close of the Grant administration . Although Grant did not agree with those who felt no sympathy for the suffering of the Southern states under reconstruction , he allowed himself to he influenced by a few intransigent advisers , like Morton , Conk ling , and Butler , to pursue a policy which counteracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress of Grant 's second administration met , in December , 1873 , an economic crisis of unusual severity had overtaken the country . As far back as the autumn of 1865 Secretary McCulloch had warned his fellow-citizens against mistaking the fever of speculative extravagance for the healthy glow of industrial prosperity . Still the signs of the evil day were slow in appearing . The mileage of new railroad tracks increased steadily until 25,000 miles had been laid in the four years of Grant 's first administration . The demand for iron and steel , taxing the capacity of our foundries and mills , indicated a rising barometer in other industries . Workers were everywhere in demand , and wages consequently were high . Great banking houses , like Jay Cooke and Company , financed the new railroads until enough track had been built for the issue of bonds , and the public , purchasing the bonds , furnished capital for the extension of the roads . Optimism prevailed , though the earnings of the roads were declining . The investors ' dreams of golden profits accounted for a rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits increased only $43,000,000 . Foreign capital also had encouraged this inflation of credit . Suddenly , in the spring of 1873 , a panic on the Vienna stock exchange checked the flow of European capital to America and threw upon footnote ' James S. Pike , " The Prostrate State . "  | the Wall Street financiers the task of carrying the enormous burden of excessive pledges . Money grew tight . Sober calculation gave way to nervous apprehension as men realized that too much capital had been converted into enterprises whose ability to pay dividends waited upon future earnings . Jay Cooke was the J. P. Morgan of his day . His name , because of his services to the government during the Civil War , had become a synonym for financial stability . When , therefore , on September 18 , 1873 , the house of Jay Cooke and Company , which was marketing the Northern Pacific bonds , closed its doors , the failure came like a bolt from the blue . Nineteen firms on the stock exchange followed Jay Cooke into bankruptcy the next day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . ' I'lie Clearing House Association issued an emergency currency , and the Secretary of the Treasury brought some relief by purchasing $3,000,000 worth of bonds in the market and by reissuing $26,000,000 of the canceled greenbacks . Thus the financial confusion was relieved ; but a long period of industrial depression , the inevitable nemesis of fatuous optimism and reckless overtrading , set in . Within five years more than 34,000 firms had gone through bankruptcy proceedings , while up to January 1 , 1876 , the railway defaults of $779,000,000 represented almost one third of the mileage in the country . Until 1878 there was a dismal record of " declining markets , exhaustion of capital , a lowering in the value of all kinds of property , . . . laborers out of employment , reductions of wages , strikes and lockouts. " 1 Paris , Berlin , and Vienna , as well as New York , had their crises in 1873 . Business depression and tight money were general in Europe as in America .

The new structure of business confidence would have risen more quickly on the sound foun- footnote t J. F. Rhodes , " The History of the United States since the Compromise of 1850 , " Vol . VII , p. 52.  | dations of a specie basis than on the shaky supports of a paper currency . But there was strong demand in the heavily indebted communities of the West for an increase in the volume of greenbacks . This form of legal-tender note had been issued during the Civil War as an emergency currency . Soon after the cessation of hostilities Secretary McCulloch had begun to retire the greenbacks , reducing their volume from $400,000,000 to $356,000,000 before Congress put a stop to further contraction by the law of February 4 , 1868 . The reason for this reversal in financial policy was the growing conviction , especially in the West , that contraction was particularly hard on those who , having borrowed depreciated greenbacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which increased in value as the quantity of them in circulation was diminished . Many a financial expert , like Senator John Sherman , who believed that the elimination of the greenbacks from the currency was sound policy , appreciated , nevertheless , the hardship which a too rapid application of the policy would entail . But while the advocates of contraction recommended caution for expediency 's sake , the inflationists urged their demands as a matter of principle . They wished to pay their debts in currency of the same value as they had borrowed . Moreover , to the Western farmer , accustomed to the unreliable issues of the wildcat banks before the war , the greenbacks were a satisfactory currency , since they were uniform in value and stamped with the government 's guarantee . The inflationists made the panic of 1873 the occasion for flooding Congress with petitions praying for the relief of the financial stringency . After a lively debate both houses passed a bill in April , 1874 , to increase the issue of greenbacks to $400,000,000 . President Grant hesitated for a time between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never was so pressed in my life , " he said some years later , " to do anything as to sign that bill , never ! It was represented to me that to veto would destroy the Republican power in the West ; that the West and the South would combine and take the country , and agree upon some even worse plan of finance . " In the end conviction won . On the ninth day after  | the passage of the bill the President sent in his veto . Thus Grant frustrated the hopes of the inflationists and set the precedent for the resistance of the sound-money men to later schemes to commit the country to a policy of cheap money . The greenbackers , however , did not give up the fight . They formed a national party in 1876 , and in the three succeeding presidential campaigns put candidates in the field . As the mid-term congressional election of 1874 approached , the Republicans realized that they had been losing ground . veto of the Inflation Bill had stirred up resentment among the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electorate generally blamed the administration , as it is always wont to do , for the misfortunes of the financial depression . In addition , the administration was injured by new scandals which recalled the revelations of the Credit Mobilier . A protege of Benjamin Butler 's in Boston , named Sanborn , was found to have made more than $200,000 in fees from contracts with the Secretary of the Treasury , which allowed the agent who collected unpaid Federal revenue taxes to keep 50 per cent of the proceeds as a commission . Secretary Richardson resigned to avoid a vote of censure by the House . Alexander ( " Boss " ) Shepherd , appointed by Grant to be governor of the District of Columbia , enriched his friends of the " District ring " by fat contracts for paving , draining , and building , before the governorship was abolished and the District put under a commission form of government . When Grant even named " Boss " Shepherd one of the commissioners , the Senate overwhelmingly rejected the nomination . The Republican campaign committee in 1874 tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration by stressing Southern " outrages " as the issue of the campaign . But all to no avail . The Democrats won a sweeping victory , changing a Republican majority of over 100 to a Democratic majority of approximately 20 in the House of Representatives . The Republicans still controlled the Senate . The revival of Democratic strength in 1874 was one evidence that the end of the reconstruction era was at hand .  | The people of the North were no longer to be persuaded that the choice of a Democrat to office was a sign of treachery to the Union . For the first time since 1860 the Democrats had won the popular branch of the legislature . There were also unmistakable signs that the Supreme Court was " recovering from the war fever . " The first test of the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment had come in the famous Slaughter House cases in 1873 , when the Supreme Court had refused to interfere with a monopoly granted by the legislature of Louisiana . The right to relief from a monopoly , said the court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from state citizenship , nor did the United States by the Fourteenth Amendment mean to assert a jurisdiction over " the entire domain of civil rights heretofore belonging exclusively to the states . " This recognition of the police power of the state of Louisiana was a reversal of the policy of stark national control of the South so sacred in the eyes of the radicals in Congress . The Republicans hastened to utilize the last months of their control of Congress by the passage of several measures which would have no chance of success when the newly elected Democratic House should by the President on January 14 , 1875 , provided that the $382,000,000 of greenbacks outstanding should be retired gradually until they were reduced to $300,000,000 , and that on January 1 , 1879 , these $300,000,000 of greenbacks should be redeemable in coin . The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to accumulate gold for the redemption of the greenbacks by the sale of bonds . A tariff act of March 3 , 1875 , repealed the 10 per cent reductions on manufactured goods made the year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal-revenue taxes on tobacco and liquor . A Civil Rights Act giving the Negroes the privilege of enjoying equal rights with the whites in public conveyances , inns , theaters , and other places of amusement , and allowing them to serve on juries , was signed by President Grant on March 1 , 1875 . Eight years later , however , the  | Supreme Court held that the earlier clauses of this act were unconstitutional , since they dealt not with civil rights but with social rights , which were outside the jurisdiction of the Federal government . The election year of 1876 was also the centennial year of the independence of the United States . Congress , the state of Pennsylvania , the city of Philadelphia , and many private citizens of wealth had contributed to a great exposition which was opened by President Grant at Fairmount Park , Philadelphia , on the tenth of May . A grandson of Richard Henry Lee read the Declaration of Independence from the original yellowed parchment , and a chorus of a thousand voices sang Whittier 's " Centennial Hymn " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The centuries fall like grains of sand . During the summer and autumn months more than eight million visitors found rare educational opportunities as they studied the exhibits to which thirty-nine foreign nations had contributed . If our own country had little to show in the line of art or of the more highly finished manufactures , ? like Belgian laces , Bohemian glass , French jewelry , Italian marbles , and Oriental ornaments , ? our display of agricultural products , of farm implements , and of practical machinery was most imposing . A giant Corliss engine stood in Machinery Hall as the symbol of American achievement . Among the lesser novelties were the incubator , the typewriter , the high-wheel bicycle , and the " lover 's telegraph " ? the embryonic telephone . Great as the progress of a century of material civilization seemed to the American of 1876 , the man of today , could he stroll through the buildings of the Philadelphia exposition , would almost feel that he had been put back into the Middle Ages , with no sign of the utilization of electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trolleys or telephones , no automobiles or airplanes , no wireless or radio , none of the marvelous productions of the age of refined steel and coal tar .  | But self-gratulation was not the sole note sounded in the centennial year . Laments and protests caused by economic distress were still heard in the land , while the disheartening revelations of corruption in high places provoked bitter denunciations . The country had not yet forgotten the Credit Mobilier , the Sanborn contracts , and the " salary grab , " when Secretary of the Treasury Bristow discovered the existence of a whisky ring with headquarters in St. Louis , which had been defrauding the government of several hundred thousand dollars annually . The prosecution of the whisky frauds followed a nauseous trail to the very door of Grant 's private secretary , but the President , with misplaced " loyalty , " intervened to save Babcock from conviction . On March 2 , 1876 , W. W. Belknap , the Secretary of War , was impeached by a unanimous vote of the House for having received , with Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable privileges at government trading-posts in the Indian Territory . Belknap escaped formal condemnation by the Senate , but at the same time confessed his guilt , by hastily resigning on the very day that impeachment was voted . Under such a moral handicap the Republicans entered the campaign of 1876 . Though some of the administration leaders had wanted Grant nominated for a third term , the House of Representatives , after much talk of " Cwsarism , " adopted a resolution in December , 1875 , to the effect that a third term would be " unwise , unpatriotic , and fraught with peril to our free institutions . " The guns of the Grant boom were spiked . James G. Blaine of Maine was the favorite of the Republican convention which met at Cincinnati in June , 1876 . His name was presented by the great orator Robert G. Ingersoll in an impassioned speech designed to drown all the voices of protest in one magnificent burst of patriotic oratory . " Like an armed warrior , like a plumed knight , " Blaine had " marched down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lance " full and fair against the brazen forehead of every traitor to his country and every maligner of his fair reputa-  | ton . " , Had the balloting begun under the spell of Ingersoll 's compelling voice , Blaine might have secured the nomination . But the day passed in the presentation of other candidates . When the voting began on the morrow , Blaine was far in the lead , although the support of the administration " machine " was given to Senator Morton , the able war governor of Indiana , and Roscoe Conkling , the imperious senator from New York . Secretary Bristow , the prosecutor of the whisky ring , was the candidate of the reform element , while Governor Hayes of Ohio was one of the strongest of the " favorite sons . " For six ballots Blaine maintained his lead , without obtaining the necessary majority . Then a drift toward Hayes began , which on the seventh ballot swelled into a flood tide , carrying him into the nomination . Rutherford B. Hayes at the time of his nomination was serving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from generations of New England ancestry a habit of industry , a deliberation of judgment , a scrupulousness of conduct , which never failed him . His conspicuously gallant service as colonel of an Ohio regiment of volunteers had earned him a brevet major-generalship at the close of the war . He was elected to Congress in 1865 , and then to the governorship of Ohio in 1867 , 1869 , and 1875 . There was no hint of demagogism , smartness , or suspicious subtlety in his public career . Though he was acceptable to President Grant and the administration leaders , he commanded the confidence of the most influential Liberal Republicans of 1872 . He was a living exemplar of his own maxim , " Ile serves his party best who serves his country best . " If it was good strategy for the Republicans to try to revive the hatreds of Civil War days , it was equally advisable for the Democrats to denounce the corruption of the Grant administration . Of the two plans of campaign the Democratic seemed more likely to succeed . " If confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , in January , 1876 , to refuse amnesty to Jefferson Davis , and his spectacular defense on the floor of the House ( June 5 ) of his own conduct in regard to certain questionable transactions in railroad bonds .  | crats had been as strong as disgust with the Republicans , " says Haworth , " there would have been little need of holding an election . " But the Democratic party in the North and West had not yet lived down its reputation for sympathy with rebellion . Furthermore , its candidate , Samuel J. Tilden of New York , in spite of his good work in exposing the Tweed ring and in smashing the corrupt canal ring at Albany , was open to objection as a shifty lawyer-politician , who had shown too little conscience in making out his income-tax returns . He was mercilessly pilloried by the Republican cartoonist Thomas Nast as too busy to hear the call of his country in 1861 , but with ample leisure to devote to his political ambitions fifteen years later . As the election returns came in during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tilden was elected . He had carried the " doubtful states " of the North , ? Indiana , Connecticut , New York , and New Jersey , ? which , with the sure Democratic states of the South , gave him 184 votes , or only one less than the needed majority . The 19 votes of Louisiana , South Carolina , and Florida were in doubt ; also the vote of one Republican elector in Oregon , who was discovered to be ineligible because he held a postmastership ( Constitution , Art . II , sect. 1 , par . 2 ) . Hayes himself believed that he was defeated ; but the day after the election Zachary Chandler , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , boldly claimed every disputed vote , and the New York Times posted the bulletin : Hayes , 185 ; Tilden , 184 . There was no doubt of the fair claim of Hayes to the Oregon vote , but he needed every one of the disputed Southern votes to win . Louisiana , South Carolina , and Florida had all sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the president of the Senate shall , in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . " Evidently , if the Republican president of the Senate , T. W. Ferry of Michigan , was empowered to open such certificates and count such votes as he saw fit , Hayes would be elected . If , on the other hand , the disputed votes were thrown out , Tilden would still lack one vote of the ma-  | jority , and the election would be thrown into the House , which was Democratic . Unless some solution for this situation could be found before March 4 , there was danger of the anarchy of an interregnum and even of civil war . ' Congress finally resolved the difficulty by passing a special act in January , 1877 , creating an Electoral Commission , composed of three Republicans and two Democrats from the Senate , three Democrats and two Republicans from the House , two Democrats and two Republicans from the Supreme Court , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his four colleagues on the commission . It was expected that Judge David Davis of Illinois , an Independent , would be chosen as the fifth member , but he was elected to the United States Senate by a only Republicans in the Supreme Court , the commission was perforce made up of eight Republicans and seven Democrats . By a strictly party decision , eight to seven , the commission counted all the disputed votes for Hayes , who was declared elected on March 2 , 1877 , by an electoral vote of 185 to 184 . Three days later he was peacefully inaugurated , and the country breathed a sigh of relief . Historians will probably never agree on the validity of Hayes 's title to the office , because their judgments in the case depend upon the balancing of one set of frauds against another . The " visiting statesmen , " sent by both parties to watch the counting of the ballots at New Orleans , Columbia , and Tallahassee , presented voluminous reports , which serve rather to confuse than to clarify the situation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballots actually cast would have probably given the state to Tilden . It is equally clear , however , that a free election would have given the state to Hayes . That many Democratic votes were thrown out by the returning board is certain ; whether more or fewer than the illegal registration is uncertain . Whatever we may think of the expediency of the Fifteenth Amendment , the Negroes had the legal right to vote . But in one of the " bulldozed parishes " i For dire predictions of civil war see Rhodes , Vol . VII , p. 242.  | of Louisiana in which more than 2000 Negroes were registered not a single vote was cast for the Republican electors . To this and similar statistics the Democrats replied that the Republicans of Louisiana had either purposely refrained from voting so that they could get the returns thrown out on the charge of intimidation , or that " a large number of colored men who had heretofore voted with the Republican party voted with the Democrats at this election .

Under the stimulus of unprecedented demands and unusual encouragements , agricultural and manufacturing industries advanced at a rapid rate . The frontier moved steadily westward as the demobilized soldiers and new hordes of immigrants joined the rush to take up the homesteads offered by the government . The clatter of the reaper and the rumble of the locomotive were heard farther and farther out on the treeless plains that had stretched silent toward the setting sun . Between 1860 and 1880 our wheat export increased from 50,000,000 bushels to 550,000,000 bushels . The products of our mills and factories , protected against European competition by the uniformly high tariffs , outran local demands and sought wider markets overseas . In the decade following the war our production of pig iron doubled , our output of coal was multiplied fivefold , and our output of steel one hundredfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38,588,371 in 1870 , ? a gain of 22.6 per cent , ? our railroad mileage increased 43.6 per cent and our manufacturing establishments 79 per cent . But the economic revolution meant more than a mere increase in the productivity of factory , field , forest , and mine . It marked the beginning of the most astounding transformation that the world has ever seen in a single generation the transformation of an America of pioneer farmers , independent manufacturers , staid business partnerships , and production adapted to the demands of local communities into a vast complex structure of " big business , " with capital issues based on anticipated profits rather than on actual assets ; with speculative pro-465  |p466  duction for markets still unreached ; with overbold extension of railway mileage ; with cutthroat competition in rates and prices , preparing the way for huge combinations of capital in oil , steel , textiles , food products , transportation , and banking . There came a marked change in the basis and size of American fortunes . The few rich men before the war had founded their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Goelets , or in the pursuit of trade had become " merchant princes , " like A. T. Stewart and " Commodore " Vanderbilt . In 1855 a man worth $100,000 was reputed " rich . " But after the war such a figure sank into insignificance . The hundreds of square miles of anthracite and oil fields in Ohio , Pennsylvania , and West Virginia , the iron deposits in Michigan and Minnesota , and the rich veins of precious metal in the Rocky Mountains , all tied by iron rails to the Atlantic seaboard , stimulated visions of wealth beyond the fabulous tales of the Arabian Nights . The country was swept into a veritable vortex of money-making , devoting its best energies to the exploitation of its material resources . The moderating influences of the Old World civilization were strikingly lacking . We had no caste of ancient aristocracy settled on immemorial estates , no leisure class of assured position , no landed clergy , no rich and mellowed tradition of the arts . The one avenue to distinction that opened , broad and inviting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one disgrace was " failure , " in the sense which that word has preserved in business parlance . Preoccupation with money-making became the unenviable badge which distinguished our people in the eyes of Europe . The government at Washington , absorbed first in the relentless task of winning the war , then in the adjustment of the political , fiscal , and diplomatic questions raised by the war , paid little or no attention , during the period from Lincoln to Hayes , to these economic changes . The conspicuous activities of politicians and statesmen were centered on problems of a different kind . Occasional attempts to interest the government in socio-economic problems met with no success . For govern-  |p467  ments are naturally conservative . Long-established habits of administrative routine , apprehension of the dangerous lengths to which innovation may go , and the political necessity for keeping party solidarity intact , all act as deterrents to new departures in legislation and administration . Therefore petitions to Congress praying for the investigation and relief of untoward conditions in industry were laid on the table . The Windom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public regulation of the railroads , was not taken up . Plainly , the national government was not ready in the seventies to grapple seriously with economic problems . Nor does the reluctance seem strange when we remember that the traditions of the American people exalted individualism . The whole policy of the government in its disposal of public lands , in such help as it had given to canals , railroads , agriculture , and education , had been to encourage private enterprise . It had been generous , often lavish , in the bestowal of opportunities , but extremely unconcerned with the control of their use . That classic exposition of the theory of laissez faire ( or the doctrine of economic liberalism ) , Adam Smith 's " Wealth of Nations , " had been published in the year of American independence . It might be regarded , in a sense , as the birth certificate of the republic . The government of business was no part of the business of government . Government was to confine itself to its political functions of making and enforcing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defending the nation against internal and external foes . Business was an individual concern , governed by the natural economic laws of supply and demand . These theories , generally acceptable in the pre-war days of moderate fortunes , began to be seriously challenged when the organization and consolidation of both capital and labor had progressed so far as to make possible the concerted action of each . Was a government which permitted the economic subserviency of one section of the country or of one class of the population to another really providing for the " general welfare " ? The transportation , mining , and manufacturing interests were beginning to bring pressure to bear upon the national and state  |p468  legislatures through skillful " lobbies . " Ought the government longer to refrain from interfering with business when business was quite unblushingly interfering with the government ? Early in the decade of the seventies the farmers of the West called upon the government for relief from oppressive economic conditions . Their pleas and protests started the " agrarian crusade , " which with little intermission has continued under one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates , abundant paper currency , free silver , direct popular government , farm-loan banks , rural credits ? to our own day . To understand this persistent factor in our politics it is necessary to know something of the social psychology and the economic situation of the farmer . In the generation after the - Civil War he was still a pioneer , pushing our frontier westward year after year . If he lived east of the Mississippi he enjoyed social and material advantages not yet known to his fellows who had occupied the western part of that great river valley . But in either section his isolation was still unrelieved by the telephone , which might put him in touch with his distant neighbor ; or the rural delivery of mail , which could bring the news of the world to his door ; or the Ford car , which could carry him in an hour or two to the county seat with its general store , its theater , its library , and its railroad station ; or the radio , which could bring the voices of noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From seedtime to harvest he toiled in the fields , in the ever-recurring struggle against the manifold enemies of nature , to bring his crops to fruition and his stock to fertility . And through the frost-bound winters he and his sons did the heavier chores about the farm , while his wife and daughters continued to weave their Penelope 's web of cooking , mending , cleaning , sewing , and washing . Whatever leisure fell to his lot was apt to be as monotonous as the toil . For the cultural opportunities were limited to the scant supply of books which the family had been able to bring to their new home , and to such instruction and inspiration as the frontier schoolroom and the weekly sermon could furnish . One family 's life was much  |p469  like another 's . They were set alongside of one another like independent units rather than related in an organic interdependence . These conditions of isolated residence and monotonous occupation are in large measure responsible for the fact that the agricultural class , in contrast to the industrial workers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , however , to bring the farmers together into an association for mutual aid . In 1867 Oliver H. Kelly , a clerk in the Department of Agriculture at Washington , organized a sort of farmers ' league , . which he called " the Patrons of Husbandry . " Patterned on the Masonic order , with passwords , grips , symbols , and ritual , its purpose was not at all political , but educational and social . The meetings of the " Grange , " which was the local club of the organization , combined the features of a lyceum , an agrarian convention , and a county fair . There might be a lecture on fertilizers by an expert on the chemistry of soils , or a discussion of a plan for the cooperative buying of agricultural machinery , followed by games and races and a picnic supper cooked by the farmers ' wives . Beginning with a nucleus of " six government clerks and an apple-grower , " the Grange made slow progress in the first three or four years against the social inertia of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grangers began to attack specific economic and political disadvantages under which they were laboring , and the movement took on new life . The leaders of the agrarian protest listed various subjects of complaint : ( 1 ) the high rates charged by middlemen who marketed the grain crop ; ( 2 ) the unfair methods of handling farm mortgages ; ( 3 ) the inadequate representation of the agrarian class in legislatures ; ( 4 ) the discrimination against ' real estate as compared with personal property in the tax levies ; 2 and ( 5 ) the opportunities given to the manufacturer footnote 1 Though 47 per cent of the population was agrarian in 1870 , only 7 per cent of the members of Congress were farmers . 2 Illinois , for example , collected 79.82 per cent of her taxes from real estate and only 20.18 per cent from personal property in 1870 . The farmers of the state contended that agricultural property actually represented less than 50 per cent of the state 's wealth . Naturally , real estate can not be hidden from the assessor like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  |p470  and the inventor to exploit the farmer under the tariff and patent laws. , During the decade from 1860 to 1870 the railroad mileage of the country increased from 30,000 to 52,000 , an expansion enthusiastically welcomed by the Western farmer , who saw thousands of acres of homestead farms brought within easy reach of the market . The farmer himself invested in the securities of the new railroads and willingly paid the higher taxes necessitated by the purchase of the railroad bonds by his state and county . But with the new decade came a sharp reversal of feeling . Early in 1871 the surrender of Paris brought to an end the series of wars by which Prince Bismarck had welded the German Empire . The return of peace , coinciding with bumper wheat crops in Russia , checked the European demand for our grain , and the Western farmers found themselves with surplus bushels in a period of falling prices . Having no facilities for storing his grain , the farmer was at the mercy of the middleman , whose capital had been necessary to him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on helplessly while wheat for which the local elevator company paid him 90 cents a bushel was selling in New York for $1.50 , and to burn his corn in Iowa because , at 15 cents a bushel , it was the cheapest fuel that he could use . The agricultural classes were neither concerned with European conditions nor conversant with the intricacies of foreign trade . They only knew that the demand for their products had been steady , and the prices high , in the days when the government was circulating abundant millions of greenbacks . They had little comprehension of the enormous initial cost of railroad-building , but realized that the roads were owned by great capitalists of the East , and heard vague rumors of the crooked manipulation of their securities in Wall Street ; of salaries of railroad magnates exceeding those of governors footnote 1 The Western grain farmer in 1870 produced a commodity which formed a large part of the exports of the country and had to compete in foreign markets with the products of free-trade countries , but when he purchased machinery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of the protection against foreign competition afforded by the tariff laws .  |p471  of states ; of the tactics of railroad promoters in influencing legislators and judges . Therefore , when they saw the price of their wheat decline 33 cents a bushel in the years 1868 ? 1872 while freight rates fell only 9 cents a bushel , they believed they were being made the victims of the rapacious railroad and elevator companies . Their sense of injustice became greater as they considered the relatively high prices which they were compelled to pay for machinery and other supplies . They sought relief along three lines : promotion of cooperative buying and selling , control of freight and elevator rates through legislation , and agitation for a plentiful paper currency . In several states cooperative effort was the first weapon used by the farmers in their fight against economic distress . The Grange organizers stressed the value of quantity purchases based upon the pooling of the farmers ' buying power . By adopting such a plan the Illinois Granges were able to buy for $175 the reapers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their purchases of threshers , plows , wagons , and sewing machines . ' In the sale of their own products , as well as in the purchase of supplies , the Grangers sought to eliminate the middleman . Thirty grain elevators , operated by salaried superintendents , were controlled by local Iowa Granges in 1874 . So optimistic was the state organization in Iowa that it purchased the Werner harvester patent and undertook to manufacture machines in its own plant . Here as elsewhere , however , the farmers lost money in cooperative manufacture and , finding themselves involved in costly patent suits , soon abandoned the project . Though the cooperative ventures of the Grangers , including tool factories , grain elevators , flour mills , meat-packing houses , insurance companies , and banks , were numerous and in some cases successful , most of them had failed by 1880 because of mismanagement , dissension among the stockholders , or the vigorous opposition of the middlemen. footnote 1 In his " Monopolies and the People " ( 1873 ) D. C. Cloud claimed that the manufacturers , protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging the farmers $225 for reapers which cost $60 to make , and were selling the same reapers in England for $100 , freight prepaid .  |p472  The leaders of the Grange movement generally denied that the organization was in politics , but the members of the local societies were in the vanguard of the agrarian forces which strove for legislative control of the railroad rates . In Illinois , Iowa , Wisconsin , and Minnesota , which produced more than one third of the wheat grown in the country in 1871 , the Granger laws originated . Under the new constitution of Illinois ( 1870 ) , which gave a mandate to the legislature " to pass laws to correct abuses and prevent unjust discrimination and extortion in rates of freight and passenger traffic , " regulative measures were enacted in 1871 , but they were declared unconstitutional two years later by the supreme court of the state . The other Granger stales followed the lead of Illinois with similar laws . Not much came of them , however , for the railroads either refused to obey the laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more stringent regulative acts . Moreover , the farmers were absolutely dependent on the railroads , which could refuse to carry the grain of the " independent " farmer or could let it stand in damp cars and spoil , or could reduce their service until they made it so uncomfortable for the public that the Granger laws began to look to many less like measures of deliverance than provocations to persecution . But the farmers did not abandon the struggle . In Illinois they were so angered by the decision of the supreme court that they threw down the gage of battle to the powers of " monopoly " in their " Farmers ' Declaration of Independence , " published on the Fourth of July , 1873 . " We hereby declare ourselves absolutely free and independent of all past political connections , " ran the declaration , " and that we will give our suffrage only to such men for office as we have good reason to believe will use their best endeavors to promote the purity , honesty , and frugality with which our fathers inaugurated this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country only a few months after this declaration , gave point to its appeal and put an end to whatever illusion might remain in the farmers ' minds as to the benefits that they would derive from the rail-  |p473  road expansion of the previous decade . With more than one third of the mileage in the hands of receivers , the farmers saw their investments wiped out by the claims of preferred creditors . The Granges multiplied rapidly , from approximately 1000 in 1872 to 8400 at the close of 1873 . The Western states alone claimed a membership of 750,000 . Fifty-three of the sixty-six counties in Illinois chose anti-monopoly candidates in the autumn elections of 1873 . Four United States senators were elected by the anti-monopoly legislatures of Illinois , Kansas , and California . During the years 1873 and 1874 new parties were formed in eleven states , pledged under various names ( Independent , Reform , and Anti-Monopoly ) to fight for the public regulation of railroad rates , relief from the Eastern bankers , and economy and honesty in government . The greatest victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed its crest . In 1876 the United States Supreme Court , deciding the case of Munn vs . Illinois , upheld the right of the state to fix maximum rates for the storage of grain in elevators . Chief Justice Waite then made the significant remark , " When , therefore , one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest , he , in effect , grants to the public an interest in that use and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good . " These were alarming words to the ardent supporters of the laissez faire theory . In the case of Peik vs. the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad ( 1877 ) the same court upheld the right of the state of Wisconsin to regulate rates within the state , even though such regulation should affect persons outside the state , " until such time as Congress should legislate on this matter . " A less spectacular , but no less important , feature of the agrarian crusade was the movement to secure a bountiful supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap money were as obvious as the reasons for the demand for cheap transportation . The average farmer was a debtor , dependent upon mortgage loans , just as he was a producer dependent upon  |p474  prompt transportation to market . Now a community which is constantly using borrowed capital favors a cheapening currency ; that is , a dollar with a diminishing rather than an increasing purchasing power . The farmer who had borrowed dollars worth half a bushel of wheat during the war did not relish paying the interest and discharging the principal of his loan in dollars worth a whole bushel of wheat . The greater the number of dollars in circulation , the less would their value be in terms of wheat or labor . Hence the farmer demanded not only that the currency should not be " contracted " ( diminished in amount ) , but that it should be actually " inflated " ( increased in amount ) . Quite naturally the Eastern creditor took the opposite side . He advocated a policy of contraction , since fewer dollars would mean more valuable dollars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greater purchasing power than those which he had loaned . In financial circles , consequently , it was generally considered not only sound policy but also common honesty to retire the greenbacks , which had been issued as emergency currency , as soon as the state of the public credit would permit . But it is to be noted that this sound financial policy coincided with the Eastern creditors ' interests while it meant increased burdens for the Western debtors . We have seen how the government started to retire the greenbacks under Secretary McCulloch in 1866 , how the process was checked by Congress in 1868 , how President Grant vetoed the Inflation Bill of 1874 , and how the Resumption Act of 1875 provided for the return to specie payments on January 1 , 1879 ( see pages 455-456 , 457 ) . Spurred to action by this chain of events , the inflationists formed a political party and in 1876 held a national convention , which nominated the aged philanthropist Peter Cooper for the presidency . The platform advocated the increased emission of paper currency by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1875 , the prohibition of national-bank note issues , and the payment of the principal of the government bonds in greenbacks unless it was expressly stated at the time of the  |p475  authorization of the bonds that they were to be paid in coin . But the Greenback party could not win the inflationists from their traditional allegiance to the Republican or Democratic parties , and succeeded in polling only 82,640 votes out of a total of 8,000,000 cast in the election of 1876 . It was as yet too exclusively a farmers ' movement ; though , strangely enough , the agitation for cheap money did not originate with the Grangers , but was adopted by them after their crusade against the railroads began to wane . The brunt of the fight against the banker and the bondholder was borne at first by the industrial workers of the East . There had been a rapid increase in labor organization during the Civil War . Sixty-one new trade unions were formed in the years 1863-1865 . A National Labor Union held annual congresses , beginning in 1866 , and attained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards of wages and work as the demobilized soldiers returned to labor and the immigrants began again to flock to our shores . ' The Eastern factory hand had been disturbed by the lag of wages behind prices in the war years , when retail prices , measured in greenbacks , increased 76 per cent while wages advanced only 50 per cent . It is true that prices began to fall after 1865 and that wages continued for a few years to move upward , yet the wageearners still felt a grievance . If they were better off absolutely , still their relative well-being was not improved . They saw the great masters of industry growing rich ; and as the economic cleft widened between them and their employers they were sure that they were not getting a fair share of the new wealth which they were producing . A class consciousness developed rapidly among them , based on an economic " inferiority complex . " footnote ' Immigration , which had reached the 400,000 mark in the prosperous decade of the fifties , fell to one sixth of that figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and with the disturbed conditions in Europe , immigration increased rapidly , reaching 326,232 in 1868 . It was checked during the years of panic and depression ( 1873-1878 ) , but rose to unprecedented totals during the boom years of the early eighties .  |p476  In 1870 , when the Grangers of Illinois were beginning to formulate their grievances against the railroads , a congress of the National Labor Union , meeting at Cincinnati , voted for the immediate organization of a political party to be called the National Labor Reform party . When the new party held its first national convention , early in 1872 , the Liberal Republican movement was well under way . Between the two " reform " groups , however , there was no cooperation . Just as the Liberal Republicans " failed to catch the ground swell " of economic discontent among either the farmers or the laborers , so the Labor Reform party was little interested in such political questions as civil-service reform , amnesty for Southern leaders , or antagonism to President Grant . The Labor Reformers nominated Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey for vice president . When both nominees declined to run , the party leaders submitted the name of Charles O'Conor of New York , who received less than 30,000 votes for president . When the Greenbackers failed to make an impression in the national election of 1876 , they looked about for allies and found them in the states where the Laborites had kept an organization intact . The advantages of pooling strength were evident in 1877 , when the Greenbackers and the Laborites presented fusion tickets in Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , and Ohio . On February 22 , 1878 , the alliance between the two parties was consummated in a convention held at Toledo , Ohio . A platform was adopted advocating the usual financial remedies for the relief of the agrarian debtor and the urban laborer . The organization was baptized with the name of the " National Party , " but it is commonly referred to as the GreenbackLabor party . In the congressional elections of 1878 it polled 1,000,365 votes , its strength being greatest in Iowa , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , and New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted that it would sweep the country in 1880 . The results in that year , however , were disappointing to the new party . Its nominee , General James B. Weaver of  |p477  Iowa , made a " whirlwind " campaign from Maine to Arkansas , addressing audiences which aggregated more than half a million people . But the vote in November fell to less than one third the figure of the triumphant year of 1878 . The causes of the slump are not far to seek . The very success of the Greenback-Labor party in the mid-term elections had provoked a concerted attack by the apprehensive press of the regular parties . Dissension appeared in the ranks of the new party between those who favored fusion with the Democrats and those who insisted upon an independent ticket . In certain quarters the party was accused of sympathy with socialistic and communistic activities , which were beginning to appear in our rapidly congesting and heterogeneous urban population . Chief of all the causes for the decline in the movement , however , was the improved condition in our economic situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dissipate the clouds of depression . " The crops of wheat , corn , and oats in 1880 were larger than ever before in our history , exceeding by 50 per cent the value of the crops of 1878 . Gold was beginning to pour in from Europe , and a surplus to accumulate in the Treasury . The amount of currency in circulation increased from an average of $725,000,000 in the years 1876-1878 to $1,114,000,000 in 1881 . Wages were rising , and the laborer abandoned the Greenback cause . In spite of the meager political results obtained by the Grangers , the Greenbackers , and the Laborites in the decade 1870-1880 , the significance of the variegated reform parties in which they grouped themselves looms large as we look back through the perspective of half a century . These earnest , if sometimes misguided , crusaders were the advance heralds in the battle for social and industrial justice , as their fathers had been the pioneers in the great work of opening up the Western lands .

They scolded , harangued , and tormented a government which had been concerned only with political questions into realizing at least , if it did not yet attempt to remedy , the economic conditions which seemed to bear with intolerable weight upon large numbers of the people . Their influence continued , under other forms of organization , until many of their demands ceased to be regarded as the vagaries of madmen , and were enacted into sober law . STALWARTS AND HALF-BREEDS Rutherford B. Hayes belonged to that relatively rare class of public officials for whom principles are religious convictions of duty . On the eve of the election of 1876 he confided to his diary the pledge : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temptation is my purpose ; I shall show a grit that will astonish those who predict weakness . " He had need of all his grit ; for , perhaps with the exception of John Quincy Adams ( in whose character and policies we can discover many similarities ) , no president in times of peace ever had a more trying situation to meet . There was a cloud on his title . His face appeared in the cartoons of the opposition press with the word " Fraud " written across the brow . The Democrats had control of the lower branch of Congress during the first half of his administration , and of both houses during the second half . His own party was divided on issues of reform to which he was pledged , and the influential leaders in Congress ? Blaine , Morton , Conkling ? were not on his side . For Hayes the Republican party was an instrument to be used in the service of the country ; for his opponents within the party it was an end in itself , the country 's savior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen ! " What the President saw as an opportunity for reform they resented as a criticism of perfection . Could he not find enough regular Republicans for his cabinet without choosing for his Secretary of State ( William M.

Key ) a man from the " rebel " state of Tennessee ? The President 's critics complained that his cabinet contained only four real Republicans . ' In his speech of acceptance Hayes declared that if elected he would aid the Southern states " to obtain for themselves the blessings of honest and capable self-government . " He did not delay in redeeming this pledge . On March 23 he conferred with the rival governors of South Carolina , Daniel H.

During the previous week he had sent an investigating commission to New Orleans , where a carpetbagger from Maine , named Packard , was maintaining a legislature by the grace of several companies of United States troops , in rivalry with Nicholls , the native Democratic claimant for the governorship . When the President had secured from Nicholls a promise to respect the war amendments and to provide a system of public education , " so that all , without regard to race or color , might receive equal advantage thereunder " ( a promise more honored in the breach than in the observance ) , he gave orders for the withdrawal of the Federal troops ( April 20 ) , and the Packard government collapsed .

McCrary of Iowa ( War ) , Richard Thompson of Indiana ( Navy ) , and Charles Devens of Massachusetts ( Attorney-General ) .  |p480  As " humiliating " to the Stalwarts as the removal of the troops from the South was the zeal with which Hayes turned to the reform of the civil service . Under the odious spoils system , which had flourished unchecked since Andrew Jackson 's day , the dispensing of patronage seemed to be the chief business of the president . He was harassed by importunate office-seekers and persistent congressmen who dictated appointments in their respective districts . Thousands of Federal officials were merely " party workers , " who interfered brazenly in elections . Party machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses dismissed competent clerks to make places for party workers , however ignorant or untrained , who had to be " taken care of . " A few earnest men , like Senator Sumner , Congressman Jenckes of Rhode Island , George W. Curtis , and Dorman B.

Congress made a grudging appropriation .

James , who had continued to administer his office according to the rules of the commission ; and he appointed to the headship of the Department of the Interior , with its large control of patronage , one of the most ardent  |p481  civil-service reformers , Carl Schurz . He issued a general order to Federal officeholders stating definitely that he was opposed to assessments levied against the salaries of government officials for political purposes , and that he would not condone the activities of office holders in the " management of political organizations , caucuses , conventions , or election campaigns . " The inevitable conflict with Congress came when Hayes started to reform the New York customhouse . Chester A. Arthur , the Collector of the Port , and Alonzo B. Cornell , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Republican machine in New York State . With Senators Conkling and Platt , they constituted the " Big Four " who ran the politics of the Empire State . The President , having satisfied himself of the reprehensible tactics of these spoilsmen , intimated to Arthur and Cornell that their resignations would be acceptable , but they declined to relinquish their posts . When Hayes sought to replace the tenacious officials , the Senate , under leadership of Conkling , rejected his appointments . The President , however , refused to retreat , and finally , through the intercession of Secretary Sherman , won over enough senators to insure the confirmation of the new nominees , General E. A. Merritt and Silas Burt . Though Hayes won his fight for reform of the New York customhouse , he did not win the Stalwarts of the party for civil-service reform . That faction began to refer to the President as a " half-breed " Republican , but he continued to urge upon Congress legislation and appropriations for the extension of the merit system . He must be regarded as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency question , as on civil-service reform , Hayes maintained a consistent and inflexible position . " The only sound paper currency , " he declared emphatically , " is one which rests upon a coin basis , and is at all times promptly convertible into coin . " The law providing for the redemption of the greenbacks in coin , passed in 1875 , had only stimulated footnote 1 A civil-service reform association was organized in New York in 1877 , and in 1881 a national civil-service reform league was formed at Newport , Rhode Island .  |p482  the-efforts of the soft-money men . It required the powerful influence of the administration to dissuade the Senate from concurring with the Democratic House in 1877 in the repeal of the Resumption Act . Secretary of the Treasury Sherman went ahead energetically with his preparations for resumption , supported by the President at every step . Through the sale of bonds the Secretary had accumulated a gold reserve of $140,000,000 at the close of the year 1878 , and the greenbacks had risen to par value . Resumption of specie payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beginning of the new year , and the confidence of the people in the government 's pledge to pay its obligations in coin was shown by the fact that on the first day of resumption only $135,000 of greenbacks were presented at the Treasury for redemption in gold , while $400,000 in gold was exchanged for the more convenient paper money . While they were unable to stay the process of resumption , the inflationists won a partial victory in the passage of an act for the limited coinage of silver . The silver situation was a complicated one . It had been the policy of the government from the beginning to maintain both gold and silver as standard legaltender coin at a fixed ratio  --  the policy of bimetallism . The ratio of 1792 , fixed by Alexander Hamilton , was 15 to 1 ; that is , the United States mints accepted both gold and silver for coinage purposes , a dollar 's worth of silver weighing fifteen times as much as a dollar 's worth of gold . But a fixed mint ratio can not continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . Gold and silver , like other commodities , such as corn and cotton , fluctuate in relation to each other as values vary in the commercial market . When the mint began to turn out coins , gold was actually more than fifteen times as valuable as silver . This " undervaluation " of gold at the mint caused the metal to disappear from the currency , and in 1834 the ratio was changed to 16 to 1 . But the new ratio merely reversed the position of the two metals . Now silver was " undervalued , " and as a consequence none of it was  |p483  brought to the mint for coinage . ' In 1873 the coinage laws were again revised , and the silver dollar ( which had not been in circulation for decades ) was dropped from the list of coins . This legislation , which made gold the sole standard , occasioned little comment at first . Within a short time , however , the cumulative effect of several events tended to reduce the value of silver in the commercial market . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bullion market large sums of silver ; the countries of the Latin Union limited their silver coinage ; India ceased to absorb the great quantities of silver which she had for decades been importing from Europe ; and finally , vast new deposits of silver were opened up in this country , the Comstock lode in Nevada yielding $22,000,000 in the single year 1877 . As a result silver became so cheap that the mine-owners would have profited by selling it to the mint at the old ratio of 16 to 1 . From the small but influential group of Western mine-owners , who watched the value of their metal steadily decline , came the first protests against the government 's action in dropping the silver dollar from the list of standard coins . They spoke of " the crime of ' 73 , " as if the demonetization of silver had been a dastardly scheme of the " gold ring " in New York , and not the simple result of their own natural desire to sell their product in the most favorable market . Now that the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return to free and unlimited coinage of silver ; that is , that the United States mints be required to purchase as much silver as was presented , at a ratio of 16 to 1 with gold , and coin standard silver dollars.2 footnote ' This disappearance of an " undervalued " metal from the currency system , which is called Gresham 's law , may be illustrated as follows : If the mint pays an ounce of gold for sixteen ounces of silver when , in the commercial world , an ounce of gold is worth only fourteen ounces of silver , silver is " undervalued " at the mint . Consequently the silver-producers will not bring their metal to the mint for coinage , but will sell it to the silversmiths ; and the money-brokers will melt down the silver dollars and have two ounces of silver bullion as profit beyond the value of the " dollar . " The silver dollar will thus disappear from the currency , as it did in the years from 1834-1878. 2 If silver could be sold at the mint at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than in the commercial market . In 1875 it stood at 16.62 to 1 ; in 1877 , at 17.22 to 1 ; in 1879 at 18.39 to 1 in relation to gold .  |p484  The mine-owners had many allies . Free silver would increase the circulating medium and so please the inflationists . Debt-burdened farmers and urban wageearners believed that a large volume of money , in this instance silver , would enable them to secure higher prices for crops and better wages in industry . The Greenbackers , failing to persuade the government to issue paper money , naturally preferred as a second choice that the country should use silver as the cheaper and more abundant metal . These groups , irrespective of party affiliation , supported the proposal of Richard P. Bland of Missouri , familiarly known as " Silver Dick " because of his interests in the Nevada mines , that the government resume the free and unlimited coinage of legal-tender silver dollars at the ratio of 16 to 1 .

In February , 1878 , the Bland-Allison Bill passed the Democratic House by a vote of 203 to 72 and the Republican Senate by a vote of 48 to 21 . It was a sectional , not a party , measure . The senators from the states west of the Alleghenies cast only four votes against the bill , and not a senator from New England , New York , or New Jersey cast a vote in its favor . Hayes refused to yield to the inflationists and vetoed the bill , but Congress overrode the President 's veto on the day that it was read , and committed the government to the coinage of at least 24,000,000 depreciated silver dollars annually. , Unsuccessful as Hayes was in his fight for a thoroughgoing footnote 1 The Bland-Allison Act accomplished none of the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of his term to urge its repeal .

For more than a year after his inauguration the Democratic House threatened to reopen the question of his title to the presidency . The Republican Senate , however , got from the Western Union Telegraph Company some thirty thousand telegrams that had been sent out in code during the campaign . When some of the dispatches were translated and published in the New York Tribune , they proved so embarrassing to the Democratic managers that the attacks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not left in peace . Urged on by the members of their party from the South , the Democrats , who won both houses of Congress in 1878 , determined to repeal the Federal election laws , or " Force Bills , " which provided for the supervision of elections by appointees of the Federal courts and empowered the Federal marshals to use soldiers to keep order at the polls . Not having a two-thirds majority to override the President 's veto , they sought to win their end by attaching " riders " to the army bill and other appropriation measures necessary to carry on the government . Hayes met these efforts with vigorous veto messages in which he denounced Congress for its attempt to deprive him of his constitutional prerogative of veto by attaching an irrelevant " rider " to an essential appropriation in the hope that he would accept the amendment rather than veto the main provisions of the bill . Finally , in 1880 , after a long battle , the President won his point . He was contending not so much for the merit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure . Whether or not the time had come for the repeal of the election laws , there was no justification for the efforts to force this repeal by blocking the wheels of government . The only lawful method was by an act of Congress , signed by the president or passed over his veto , or by a decision of the Supreme Court declaring the laws unconstitutional .  |p486  At the beginning of his administration Hayes had announced his opposition to a second presidential term . There were , however , other reasons why he was not considered for renomination in 1880 . He had alienated the powerful Stalwart branch of the party by his conciliatory Southern policy and by his earnest fight for civil-service reform . Furthermore , he had refused to use his power of patronage to build up a personal following within the party ranks . In September , 1879 , the triumvirate of Stalwart senators ? Conkling , Cameron , and Logan ? started a third-term boom for General Grant , who had just completed a triumphal trip around the world . Before the Republican convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to pledge 304 delegates to the nomination of the " hero of Appomattox . " But Blaine also had a strong following among the Stalwarts , while the " HalfBreeds , " who approved the policies of the Hayes administration , were for John Sherman or Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont . A victory for Grant depended upon the ability of the triumvirate to enforce the " unit rule , " that is , that a state 's entire delegation should vote as the majority directed . The fight against the unit rule was waged successfully by General James A. Garfield of Ohio , leader of the Sherman forces , who thereby made the nomination of Grant virtually impossible . For thirty-three ballots the convention was deadlocked between Grant and Blaine , with Sherman a weak third in the race . The Blaine and Sherman forces represented a majority , but the gulf between the Stalwart leader and Hayes 's Secretary of the Treasury was too wide to bridge . Neither was it possible for Blaine and Conkling , the bitterest of enemies , to come to any agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 votes to Garfield and started the stampede which resulted in his nomination on the thirtysixth ballot . Grant 's " Old Guard " of 306 delegates remained faithful to him to the end . Chester A. Arthur was named for the vice presidency , " as a sop thrown to Conkling and the Stalwarts . " Garfield succeeded in rallying all the factions in his party  |p487  to his support . He was warmly commended by President Hayes and the " Half-Breeds " and was supported generally by the reform element of the party . Such Stalwarts as Conkling and Grant spoke for him at public meetings . The Democratic candidate , General Winfield Scott Hancock , the hero of Gettysburg , was , like Garfield , a gallant soldier'and a winsome man , but he was wholly without Garfield 's training and experience in politics . ' Although the platform stated that the " great fraud of 1876 " was the issue that " precedes and dwarfs every other , " the Democrats found the country singularly unresponsive . They were no more successful in their attempt to discredit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobilier scandal . The upward trend of business activities undoubtedly helped the Republicans much more than their efforts to make the preservation of the results of the Civil War an issue of the campaign . Garfield won the election by 214 electoral votes to 155 , but the popular vote was so evenly divided that he had a majority of less than 9000 . He carried all the states of the North and West except New Jersey , Nevada , and five of the votes of California.2 Hancock carried the " solid South , " which , from the election of 1880 to the election of Theodore Roosevelt twenty-four years later , did not contribute a single electoral vote to the Republican column . The result of the election proved that President Hayes had served his party well in serving his country well . He returned to private life on March 4 , 1881 , with a record unsullied by the temptations of ambition and with a reputation for statesmanship which has grown with the passing years . Ile met every public question with a calm decision that revealed the inflexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation of his gracious wife , Lucy Webb Hayes , made the footnote ' Hancock was much ridiculed during the campaign for his assertion that the tariff is " a local issue . " But our history has proved that if the tariff has not been a strictly " local " issue , it has always been a narrowly sectional one . The loss of votes in California was due to the anti-Chinese sentiment in the state . On October 20 there was published an alleged letter from Garfield to a Mr. Morey , approving the cheap labor of the Chinese on the coast . Garfield promptly denounced the " Morey letter " as a forgery , but its mischief had already been done .  |p488  White House the center of a quiet , dignified hospitality the influence of which penetrated the social life of the capital . When Hayes visited Harvard College at the Commencement of 1877 to receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws , he had an even more fitting title conferred upon him by the poet Oliver Wendell Holmes in the prophetic phrase " His Honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and sociological conditions which marked the generation following the Civil War were seldom apparent in the platforms of the two major political parties or in the campaign speeches of the Republican and Democratic politicians . They were reflected in somewhat distorted fashion in the " manifestoes " of the various " third party " movements . But a surer indication of the new kinds of problems with which the republic was to be concerned in the second century of its existence appeared in the voluminous records of the tenth census ( 1880 ) . It furnished the economic and social statistics which explain in large measure the political ideas developing in various parts of the country . It revealed the conditions of industry , commerce , and banking in the East which made that section a stronghold of conservatism in the generation to come ; it showed why the West was the recruiting ground for groups and parties advocating radical measures in agrarian legislation , transportation , and currency ; it heralded a " New South , " founded on industrial expansion and diversified production in place of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our political and constitutional history from colonial days to the present has been determined more by the competing or conflicting interests of certain sections of the population than by any abstract theories of government based upon political metaphysics , it will be helpful to consider some of the figures of the tenth census from the point of view of these sectional interests . For this purpose let us divide the country into three parts : ( 1 ) the group of twelve  |p489  industrial states lying north of the Potomac and the Ohio and east of Indiana and Michigan ; ( 2 ) the group of twelve agricultural and mining states of the West ; and ( 3 ) the group of fourteen Southern states , including the states of the secession plus Missouri , Kentucky , and West Virginia . The remaining ten states of our present Union were still under the territorial form of government in 1880 . The industrial states of the first group , comprising about one fourteenth of the country 's area , contained 34 per cent of the total population of 50,155,783 . This section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundry , and mill , was credited with 68.2 per cent of the total manufactured products of the nation . Although the modern " trust " had hardly made its appearance , the trend toward concentration in industry was already unmistakable . In the decade from 1870 to 1880 , while the number of manufacturing establishments with an output of $500 or more had shown little change ( 253,882 as against 252,148 ) , the number of employees had increased 36.8 per cent , and the value of the products 31.6 per cent . Mills and factories were drawing men , women , and children by the thousands from the farms and villages , and absorbing tens of thousands who came to our shores from the Old World . The 2,812,191 immigrants of the decade prior to 1880 increased to 5,246,613 for the following ten years . During this latter period the larger proportion of foreigners coming from eastern and southern Europe was noticeable in the records kept at the ports of entry . These newer immigrants , thrust out of their native lands by economic hardship or racial persecution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities in America and to the manufacturers ' demand for cheap labor . The industrial section of the country was rapidly becoming urbanized . Within its limits were to be found 166 of the 286 cities of over 8000 population , and 3,079,937 of the 6,679,943 foreign persons in the country . The social , economic , and political effects of this herding of people into the great industrial centers , which continued at an accelerating pace  |p490  during the decade of the eighties , were of enormous consequence . So busy were the municipal authorities providing fire departments , waterworks , police protection , and street paving that they ' neglected problems of housing , sanitation , health , and morals . Slums spread noisomely as the " proletariat " multiplied . Strikes and lockouts , picketing and blacklisting increased as capital and labor , ever more " classconscious , " engaged in open conflict . Controversies over wages , hours , the closed or open shop , the labor of women and children , the recognition of the unions , the liability of employers for the health and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns of the press . The presence of large numbers of newly arrived and hastily naturalized foreigners offered the " bosses " of the cities unrivaled opportunities for political demagogy . And the foundations were deeply and firmly laid for that regime of urban corruption which our foreign visitors like Mr. Bryce deplored as the canker of the American democracy , and which our own critics so mercilessly exposed in books on " The Shame of the Cities " and " The Boss and the Machine . " That humanitarian zeal which had been the driving force of the anti-slavery crusade found expression in many new causes . But it made distressingly slow headway in its warfare against poverty , disease , and vice . Men high in public life could openly sneer at reform and deliberately block remedial legislation without losing their own self-respect or the regard of their communities . Of course these deplorable conditions were only the seamy side of the fabric , the ugly reverse of the pattern in which we took great pride . Our national wealth had reached $43,600,000,000 , or $870 per capita . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agriculture , and mining was $10,395,000,000 as against $10,130,000,000 for Great Britain and $6,625,000,000 for France ? our nearest competitors . We already led all other nations of the world in the last three items , were surpassed only by Great Britain , France , and Germany in commerce , and by , Great Britain alone in banking . With the completion of our first century of national existence , the balance of trade turned definitely in our favor . figure  |p492  Until 1876 our imports had exceeded our exports in every year but three ( 1858 , 1862 , 1874 ) ; but since 1876 there have been only three years ( 1888 , 1889 , 1893 ) in which our exports have fallen below our imports . In spite of the phenomenal increase in manufacturing and merchandising , and the consequent drift of population from the countryside into the large cities , in 1880 slightly more than - 14 per cent of our population were farmers ; and of these , about 90 per cent were native-born as against 68 per cent in the manufacturing industries . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period 1860-1880 , and the Southern states 46.7 per cent , the agricultural and mining states of the West had more than doubled their population as a group , and in some cases had grown fourfold , eightfold , even fourteenfold . About 1,500,000 of this addition to the population of the West consisted of foreign immigrants , but the remaining 5,500,000 came mostly from the older states , drawn by the attraction of free lands offered by the Homestead Act , and by the advantages of the widening markets which new railroads and marvelous improvements in agricultural machinery provided . ' In the single decade from 1870 to 1880 the number of American farms grew from 2,659,985 to 4,008,907 , and a new acreage equal to the area of Great . Britain and France combined was brought under cultivation . The production of cereals throughout the country increased more than twice as fast as the population , leaving a mounting surplus for export . By 1880 we were already supplying half the needs of the wheat-importing countries of the world , with Russia , Hungary , Turkey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvests , especially in Russia and the Argentine , increased the world 's wheat supply by 262,000,000 bushels in the years 1875-1878 . As a result , the price was 98 cents a bushel in the latter year , compared with $1.38 in footnote 1 Between 1860 and 1880 the value of farm tools and machinery increased 65 per cent , and the per-capita production of wheat grew from 5.6 bushels to 9.2 bushels  |p493  1872 . Threatened with economic suffocation by the very abundance of their crops , and unable to control the transportation and storage agencies for their marketing , the farmers developed that psychology of cooperative protest which we have noticed in the Granger and Greenback movements . Next to farming , the mining of the precious metals was the most important industry of the West . Ever since the mad rush of the " forty-niners " to the gold fields of California , every new discovery of placers or veins had drawn its crowd of gamblers and desperadoes to the ephemeral mining camps . Gold was discovered on Cherry Creek , Colorado , in 1858 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of people flocked to this new El Dorado . Denver sprang from a stage station to a city , it might almost be said , in a night . A line of alleged cities arose along the east base of the mountains , like Jonah 's gourd. " 1 In the same year ( 1858 ) a vein of metalbearing rock was discovered in Nevada , but its value was so little suspected that it was sold to one Comstock for " a few drinks of whisky and a bobtailed pony . " From 1860 to 1876 , when its rich ores began to be exhausted , there were taken from the Comstock lode $234,000,000 in gold and silver ; and the population of the state ( admitted to the Union in 1864 ) rose from 6857 to 62,336 ? a gain of 808 per cent . In 1874 some miners in General Custer 's force discovered gold in the Black Hills of Dakota Territory , a part of the Sioux Indians ' reservation . The Indians had to retire before the rush of speculators , 2 who raised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1880 . In the latter year one sixth of the total gold production of the country was taken from the veins of the Black Hills . Soon after the discovery of gold in Dakota , large deposits of silver were found in Colorado ( 1877 ) . Again tens of thousands of fortuneseekers rushed to the diggings , throwing up towns of wooden shanties which housed the strange human aggregations whose footnote 1 Robert P. Porter , " The West from the Census of 1880 , " p. 373. 2 The ambush and massacre of General Custer 's entire force at the Little Big Horn River , in June , 1876 ( see page 437 ) ; was an incident of the protest of the Sioux against their removal .  |p494  spirit has been forever preserved in the prose of Bret Harte and Mark Twain . Stray Horse Gulch grew in a few months into the city of Leadville , " a city of 15,000 in a wilderness of sagebrush ten thousand feet above the sea . " By 1880 the state 's population had gained 467 per cent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , California , and the territory of Dakota , produced 90.1 per cent of the country 's yield of gold in 1880 and 93.5 per cent of the yield of silver . The gold was readily absorbed by our expanding business , as the currency tended to contract by the reduction of the bonded debt , upon which the national-hank notes were based . But the silver , of which nearly eleven hundred tons were mined in 1880 , depreciated steadily in market value ; hence the determined efforts of the Western mine-owners to stabilize the price of silver by its remonetization as legal tender at a fixed ratio with gold , and hence the alliance of the agrarian and silver interests against the Eastern bankers for a cheaper and more abundant currency . For the South the census of 1880 was both the reflection of conditions entailed by the war and the reconstruction era , and a harbinger of new and better fortunes . Although the states of the secession had not yet been completely released from political quarantine , they were all restored to home rule , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only upon their economic recovery . That recovery was slow , for the exhaustion had been complete . Of the three factors entering into the production of wealth ? namely , capital , labor , and land ? the first had disappeared entirely ; the second was in the most confused and demoralized state ; while the third remained , full of promise , but waiting for the cooperation of the other two for its fruition . Between 1860 and 1870 the total value of the land had declined almost 50 per cent . This cheapness of productive acres , coupled with the abnormally high price of cotton just after the war , offered to a large number of Southerners who could never have hoped to enter the " planter class " in the pre-war days the opportunity to try their hands in cultivating  |p495  the great Southern staple . As the old owners seldom had the capital to make the necessary improvements on their land or to hire laborers , and the new owners seldom had the money to buy their land outright , the system of " farm-cropping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sort of feudal land tenure . The proceeds of the land were divided between the owner and the tenant according to the shares of capital and labor furnished , or the risk assumed , by each . I f the tenant furnished labor only , he received generally one third of the crops or an equivalent sum of money after the crop was sold . If he provided equipment in addition to his labor , he received proportionately more , according to agreements struck . " Capital and labor entered into a real partnership , " says Professor Holland Thompson , " both embarking in a venture the deferred results of which were dependent chiefly upon the industry and good faith of the laborer. " i But there entered into the situation another factor , which was of the greatest importance in working out the problems of Southern rehabilitation ; namely , the system of agricultural credit . The farmer , whether he happened to be planterlandlord or tenant , all too frequently was compelled to secure advances of cash or commodities for his daily living . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ungathered , and perhaps even unplanted , crop . Until his debt to the merchant was discharged and it seldom was ? the farmer was in a state of economic servitude . He could not dispose of his crop in a free market or hold it for a rise in prices . He was obliged , on pain of having his credit cut off , to confine himself to the production of cotton or tobacco , because these crops were the " safest " in the eyes of the merchant-creditor . " Both could be stored conveniently with little danger of deterioration , neither was liable to a total failure ; a ready market for both was always available ; and neither tempted the thief until it was ripe . " 2 Furthermore , it was to the interest of the creditor-merchant to discourage the cultivation of foodstuffs in order that he might have a monopoly in supplying the community with corn meal , flour , hams , footnote ' Holland Thompson , " The New South , " p. 67. 2 Ibid. p. 63.  |p496  and bacon from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " farm-cropping , " with its credit arrangements , flowed important consequences . Diversification of crops was retarded ; a host of small money-lenders , many of them loan sharks , sprang up and flourished ; country merchants expanded their activities and emerged as brokers , commission men , and bankers in the larger towns . The commercial system took on the attributes of that of the North and West , and the cottongrower , like the grain farmer , struggled with problems of interest charges , transportation costs , middlemen 's profits , and declining prices . Although the road to economic and political rehabilitation seemed particularly rough and difficult for the South , there were certain factors which helped to smooth the way . If the region had its eternal Negro problem , it was nevertheless spared the labor agitation which vexed the industrial centers . The white population , except in Texas , was almost entirely native-born . In 1880 the Southern states east of the Mississippi contained less than 1 per cent of foreign-born inhabitants . Again , even if the exploitation of the resources necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton-growing in the lower South , those resources were nevertheless there in great abundance . By 1880 , coal , iron , and phosphates , which had lain untouched beneath the soil , began to be brought to the surface . Mills and factories , built on the sites of cheap water power , began to draw the rural population of the Piedmont region into towns . Cotton goods , flour , foundry products , agricultural implements , leather goods , woolens , drugs , and chemicals began to appear in the lists of Southern manufactures . While the lists were not yet long , and the total value of the manufactural products was less than one tenth of the output of the mills and factories of the North , a beginning had been made . An International Cotton Exposition at Atlanta , Georgia , in 1881 , impressed on its 300,000 visitors the ability of the South ? with its advantages of cheap land and labor , low taxes , lack of pressure from the labor unions , and abundant supplies of fuel and raw material ? to compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarser grades of cotton goods . Already the 300,000 cotton spindles of 1860 had doubled , and were to double again in the years 1880-1885 . The railroad mileage was expanding rapidly , keeping pace with the rate in the country at large . The old South had passed away in humiliation and pain . The census of 1880 heralded the birth of another order , which Henry W. Grady , of the Atlanta Constitution , in a speech of 1886 , proudly called " the New South . " ' The divergent interests of the various sections of the country , so well illustrated in the figures of the tenth census , cut across the old party lines . Just as there were many high-tariff and hard-money Democrats in the industrial East , so there were thousands of Western Republicans who supported the demands of the agricultural and mining interests . It was not until agrarian radicalism became strong enough , first to frighten both the great parties , and then to capture one of them , that the economic and social sectionalism found its full political expression . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of the South . The " New South " was also the " solid South . " The Republicans still bore the hated name of Radicals in the Southern states , and were the party footnote 1 A significant factor in the rise of the New South was the rehabilitation of the educational system . Not until certain funds donated by generous philanthropists were made available for joint disposition by Northern and Southern administrators , in communities freed from carpetbag control , did substantial improvement in Southern education begin . The happy era was dawning in 1880 . In that year , for example , Booker T. Washington was chosen principal of a newly founded normal school in Tuskegee , Alabama , and carried into the lower South his gospel of the redemption of his race through the work of its hands . In 1880 , also , Dr. J. L. M. Curry , a native of Alabama , became the agent of the fund given in 1867 by George Peabody , a London banker , and administered it for twenty-two years with unfailing wisdom . In 1882 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a little later Miss Anna Jeanes of Philadelphia gave a fund for the improvement of rural schools . All these agencies and other funds were coordinated by the Southern Education Board in 1901 , and two years later the General Education Board was incorporated , through which the late John D. Rockefeller donated several million dollars for the promotion of education and health in the South .  |p498  of the Negro and the scalawag . The white citizens generally ? whether of Whig or Democratic antecedents , whether of the social class of the planters or the " crackers , " ? under the name of Conservatives , steadily supported the Democratic party . Any adequate account of the bases of the new economic order would have to deal with a number of inventions and discoveries , bold business enterprises , and industrial exploitations , which it has been impossible even to mention in the limits of this chapter . Particularly significant were the achievements in the field of applied science . In 1876 Alexander Graham Bell knew that his telephone was a success . The following year Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his phonograph . At Menlo Park in New Jersey he perfected the incandescent lamp ( 1878 ) and built an electric railway ( 1880 ) . Other patents , notably the Brush arc lamp ( 1879 ) and the trolley car ( 1882 ) were likewise heralds of the coming era of electricity . According to the census of 1880 there were more than 70 plants in the country manufacturing electrical supplies , while 148 telephone companies maintained more than 54,000 central stations . Improved and cheapened methods of refining iron had resulted in the increase of our steel production from 9000 tons in 1863 to 1,400,000 tons in 1880 . After 1881 , pipe lines carried the mounting tide of oil from the Pennsylvania and Ohio fields to the Atlantic seaboard . Our railroads , reorganized following the depressing years of the middle seventies , were equipped with Westinghouse air brakes , Miller couplers , and Pullman cars . These were a few of the factors which almost miraculously transformed the life of a people accustomed to ride in rumbling horse cars , heated by rickety stoves , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel at twenty miles an hour over light rails and quivering timber bridges in wooden cars drawn by wheezy locomotives . The new age brought in the names of Armour and Carnegie and Rockefeller , of Harriman and Hill and Morgan , men of driving energy and masters of administrative art . It also brought its congenial philosophy of the dominance of private s  |p499  interest , ruthless , selfish , efficient , and sometimes lawless and corrupt ? a philosophy which , in the forceful words of Profes sor Beard , " held that all the natural resources of the country should be transferred to private hands as speedily as possible , at a nominal charge or no charge at all , and developed with dashing rapidity " ; which " believed that the great intangible social property created by community life , such as franchises for street railways , gas , electricity , should be transformed into private property " ; and which " looked upon state interference , except to preserve order and aid railways and manufacturers in their enterprises , as an intrinsic evil to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new age , with its glory of achievement for the few and its frustration of ambition for the many , came the conflict between two opposing interpretations of American freedom which has been waged in the last generation : freedom to be protected in the appropriation and development of the boundless resources of our country , and freedom to be protected by a democratic government in the enjoyment of equal economic opportunity and a fair share of the fruits of the labor of one 's hands .

Should the government deal with them , and if so , how ? Should it adopt a consistent currency policy , reform the tariff , regulate conditions of labor , restrict immigration , curb monopolies , purify the civil service ? Neither of the major parties was ready with a clear and unequivocal answer to these questions . Under the necessity of becoming all things to all men , they made their platforms " paragons of ambiguity " and their legislation chapters of compromise . Each seemed chiefly concerned to bring enough suspicion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and to keep it out of power when it was out . The pot called the kettle black , while the dinner waited . " Neither party has any clear-cut principles , any distinctive tenets , " wrote James Bryce . " Both claim to have tendencies . Both certainly have war-cries , organization , interests enlisted in their support . But those interests are in the main the interests of getting and keeping the patronage of the government . " These words of the distinguished ambassador from Great Britain explain why the decade of the eighties has a dull and drab aspect for the student who is not interested in the manipulation of petty party interests and the shift of party fortunes . ' In politics and in business it was a period of self-made men . The new president , James A. Garfield , was one of the most conspicuous examples of the type . Beginning his career on the footnote 1 The deadlock was largely due to the fact that until December , 1889 , the President did not have a clear majority of his party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress ( 1883-1885 ) , and the Senate was Republican during Cleveland 's whole term ( 1885-1889 ) .  |p502  towpaths of an Ohio canal , young Garfield made his way , by carpentering , farming , and teaching , to Williams College . At the age of twenty-six he was promoted from the professorship of ancient languages to the presidency of Hiram College in Ohio . Serving with distinction as an officer of volunteers in the Civil War , he was advanced to the rank of major general for conspicuous bravery on the field of Chickamauga . At Lincoln 's earnest request , he entered Congress ( December , 1863 ) , where he was of great service as chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs and , after the war , as an authority on public finance . Into the presidency he brought great gifts of intellect and a long experience in public affairs . But men who knew him intimately feared that his strength of will and moral purpose were not commensurate with his intellectual gifts . His inaugural address was disappointingly silent on matters of policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new president was not happy as the dispenser of jobs to office-seekers , nor was he powerful enough to quiet the factional quarrels between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds . The appointment of Blaine as Secretary of State infuriated Conkling , who determined to wage war against the administration as soon as he discovered that W. H. Robertson , his most prominent political foe in New York , had been nominated for the post of Collector of the Port of New York . Having failed to persuade the Senate to reject the appointment , Conkling , joined by his colleague , Senator Platt , petulantly resigned from the Senate and sought vindication at the hands of the New York legislature . To the surprise of the Stalwarts and the amusement of the administration , the legislators at Albany , after several weeks of balloting , upheld President Garfield and refused to return Conkling and Platt . ' Thus the Garfield-Blaine forces completed the discomfiture of the Stalwarts , which began when their candidate was defeated in the convention of 1880. footnote ' Conkling in high dudgeon retired from politics permanently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play an influential role as the " easy boss " of New York State .  |p503  But Blaine 's ambitious plans for a brilliant administration were shattered at the very moment when their promise seemed brightest . On the morning of July 2 , as President Garfield , accompanied by Blaine , entered the railroad station at Washington to take the train for a college reunion at Williamstown , he was shot in the back by a wretch named Guiteau , who had been vainly seeking an office and who , at his trial , boasted that he was a Stalwart and wanted to seat Arthur in the presidential chair . Garfield fought bravely for life during the summer , but finally succumbed at Elberon , New Jersey , on September 19 , the anniversary of his gallant service at Chickamauga . In the trial of Guiteau , which dragged through several weeks of nauseating testimony , there was abundant evidence that the whole political atmosphere was per meated with the mephitic air of factional strife . The personal character of men in high places was attacked unsparingly . Conkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoilsman , and the prosecution of the Star Route frauds by Postmaster-General James , with Garfield 's hearty support , had increased the venom of factional hate . The Star Routes ' were lines of mail transportation in the thinly settled West , which were let out by contract to the lowest bidders , who engaged to carry the mail with " celerity , certainty , and security . " Through clever detective work Postmaster-General James found that millions of dollars were being paid annually to contractors , often on fake " straw " bids , for mail never delivered and routes not opened . The graft was being shared by Second Assistant Postmaster-General Brady , ex-Senator S. W. Dorsey , secretary of the Republican national committee , and others in high position . ' When Garfield refused footnote They got their name from the stars , or asterisks , with which they were marked in the postmaster 's list . 2 Dorsey , a carpetbagger from Arkansas , was tendered a dinner in February , 1881 , at which General Grant presided , and Henry Ward Beecher asked grace ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly needed . At this dinner Vice President-elect Arthur raised a laugh by referring to the financial methods which Dorsey had used in carrying the state of Indiana for the Republicans .  |p504  to call off the investigation , Brady published a letter which the president-elect had written on August 23 , 1880 , to " My dear Hubbell , " chairman of the Republican congressional committee , showing that Garfield approved the system of levying assessments on government employees for campaign funds . It would be impossible to show any direct connection between these exposures and the assassination of the President , but Postmaster-General James expressed his belief that Garfield would not have been shot had he not antagonized the Star Route ring and its powerful friends . The trials of the conspirators dragged on until 1883 ; but , with the exception of one or two inconspicuous persons , the culprits all managed to escape conviction . The revelations of the Guiteau trial and the Star Route cases gave fresh impetus to the demands of the civil-service reformers . The tragedy of Garfield 's assassination seemed all the darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This machine politician , who had been Conkling 's chief lieutenant in New York , who had been removed for gross mismanagement from the only public office that he ever held , who seemed to be in his proper element as the arbiter of fashion among the club men of New York , and who had been given the vicepresidential nomination only to placate the faction of the Stalwarts , ? this " Chet " Arthur was now , to the amusement of the flippant and the consternation of the serious , President of the United States . But Arthur happily disappointed those who feared that he would bring the methods of the " pothouse politician " into the White House . A latent dignity in him rose to meet the grave responsibilities of his high office . He handled men and measures with wisdom , tact , and vigor , quickly assuming a position of leadership in the affairs of his administration . If the Stalwarts hoped that he would restore their shattered fortunes , they were grievously disappointed , for there was no proscription of Garfield 's appointees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his first annual message , which was highly encouraging to the friends of reform but wormwood to the Stalwarts , the President  |p505  recommended the retirement of the silver certificates , the reduction of the tariff , honest administration of the pension system , and , chief of all , the reform of the civil service . Perhaps the most important result of Garfield 's assassination was the elimination of James G. Blaine from office . The brilliant Secretary of State would have un- Blaine 's questionably been the dominating force in the Aggressive Garfield administration . ' In his brief term of Foreign Policy office ( March 4 to December 19 ) he had not only begun to build up the " Half-Breed " fortunes by his influence in distributing the patronage , but he had embarked upon a vigorous foreign policy as well . Blaine took a rather jingoistic tone toward Great Britain on the Isthmian canal , a subject of lively discussion at the moment because a French company under Ferdinand de Lesseps had obtained from the republic of Colombia a right of way across the Isthmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ignoring the ClaytonBuiwer Treaty of 1850 , which provided for a joint guaranty of the neutrality of the canal by Great Britain and the United States , Blaine announced that our treaty of 1846 with New Granada ( Colombia ) was a sufficient basis for the sole guaranty of the neutrality of the canal by the United States . Several months later , in pressing for the formal abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty , he took occasion to remark that the military power of the United States " is without limits , and in any conflict on the American continent altogether irresistible . " This truculent attitude was only a part of Blaine 's general program for the increase of the diplomatic and commercial prestige of the United States in Latin America . footnote ' Garfield 's cabinet included James G. Blaine of Maine ( State ) ; William Windom of Minnesota ( Treasury ) ; Robert T. Lincoln of Illinois ( War ) ; W. H. Hunt of Louisiana ( Navy ) ; Wayne MacVeagh of Pennsylvania ( Attorney-General ) ; T. L. James of New York ( Postmaster-General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Of this group Arthur retained only Secretary of War Lincoln . His other appointments were F. T. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey ( State ) ; C. J. Folger of New York ( Treasury ) ; W. E. Chandler of New Hampshire ( Navy ) ; B. H. Brewster of Pennsylvania ( Attorney-General ) ; T. O. Howe of Wisconsin ( Postmaster-General ) ; and H. M. Teller of Colorado ( Interior ) .  |p506  He intervened in a war between Peru and Chile , sending a special envoy to those countries to recommend terms of peace ; he interfered in a boundary dispute between Mexico and Guatemala ; and , finally , a few weeks before he left office , he sent invitations to the countries of Central America and South America to attend a Pan-American congress in Washington , disclaiming any thought of dictation or compulsion , although our commanding position in the New World might well give our government " a claim to authoritative utterance for the purpose of quieting discord among its neighbors , with all of whom the most friendly political relations exist . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revoked the instructions given to Blaine 's envoy to Peru and Chile , and withdrew the invitations to the congress . He likewise permitted the controversy over the Isthmian canal to die down , especially after the failure of the French project became evident . Meanwhile President Arthur had made little headway in securing the cooperation of his Congress . Bills for the reform of the civil service were brought in and conand signed to the committee graveyard . The urgent question of the revision of the tariff to reduce an embarrassing surplus , which in 1881 alone amounted to $100,000,000 , failed to get beyond reference of the whole matter to a commission of investigation . The only legislation of note passed during the long session of Arthur 's first Congress was the anti-polygamy 1 and Chinese-exclusion bills , which could injure the political prospects of neither party , and a " pork barrel " river and harbor bill footnote 1 The practice of polygamy , or plural marriages , was officially sanctioned in 1852 by the Mormons , who had established themselves in 1847 in the Salt Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utah . On March 22 , 1882 , President Arthur signed the Edmund 's Act for the suppression of polygamy in Utah . It imposed penalties of fine and imprisonment on those convicted of the offense . For several years the Mormon Church fought the act as an unwarranted interference with religious freedom , but in 1890 the Church gave way and withdrew its sanction of the practice , which gradually died out . In 1896 Utah was admitted to the Union , with a constitution containing the clause " Polygamy , or plural marriages , are forever prohibited . "  |p507  which satisfied the greed of both . The measure of 1882 called for $18,748,875 to meet the demands in five hundred localities , including the improvement of " rivers " whose names ( the Choptank , the Waccemaw , the Yallabusha , and the Cheesequake ) were known only to the congressman of the district . President Arthur vetoed the bill , declaring that the extravagant expenditure of public money produced " a demoralizing effect upon those who are intrusted with official duty through all the ramifications of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet in the nostrils of Congress . Both houses passed the bill over the President 's veto . The Chinese Exclusion Bill was a result of the growing antipathy toward the Chinese , based on both economic and social grounds . Prior to 1870 , laborers from the Celestial Empire had been welcomed on the Pacific coast , where their qualities of industry and frugality were appreciated . The Burlingame Treaty of 1868 had given Chinese subjects the unlimited right of immigration into the United States and the guaranty of the treatment here accorded to citizens of the most favored nation . Thousands of coolies had been imported by Leland Stanford to work on the Central Pacific Railroad . When that project was completed in 1869 , great numbers of them were thrown into competition with white labor , which at the moment was using its newly acquired strength to secure better wages , shorter hours , and an American standard of comfort . The Chinese , however , were willing to work far into the night and live on rice to amass the modest fortune needed to take them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European immigrants , they never became Americans , but remained unassimilable , with furtive traits and incomprehensible habits . Their quarters in Chinatown were squalid , reeking with opium and vice . In 1877 a sharp business depression in California threw out of employment thousands of men , who vented their resentment on the unresisting Chinese . Great crowds gathered on the " sand lots " to listen to the incendiary harangues of Denis Kearney on the text " The Chinese must go . " Paraders with placards demanding " Four dollars a day and roast beef "  |p508  invaded the quarters of Chinatown , maltreated the inhabit  - -  ants , and threatened them with death . " Kearneyism " stirred the congressmen from the Pacific coast to action . In January , 1879 , Congress instructed the President to notify the Chinese government that the privilege of free immigration would be withdrawn after the first day of July ensuing . But Hayes very properly vetoed this unilateral abrogation of the Burlingame Treaty and sent a commission to China , which induced the Chinese government to agree that the United States might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prohibit absolutely ) the immigration of Chinese laborers . On the basis of this concession Congress passed a bill in the spring of 1882 forbidding the entrance of Chinese laborers into the country for a period of twenty years . This bill President Arthur vetoed , and Congress enacted a second measure which reduced the period of restriction from twenty to ten years to meet the President 's objections . So far as results were concerned Arthur might as well have signed the first bill ; for the exclusion of Chinese labor was renewed by the Geary Act at the close of the ten-year period and became the established policy of the country.l With a persistence which surprised his associates of earlier days , President Arthur pressed upon Congress the need for reform of the civil service . His words had The Pendleton peculiar force in connection with the dis-Act graceful record of the spoilsmen who had dogged the footsteps of the martyred Garfield . While the politicians in Congress continued to evade the issue , years of agitation on the part of the reformers began to stir the electorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-term elections of 1882 to their failure to tackle the problem of civil-service reform , determined to champion a measure with some element of protection for Republican officeholders , who would undoubtedly suffer if the incoming Democrats were permitted to frame the bill . The outcome was the Pendleton Act of 1883 , designed to substitute merit footnote 1 A further restriction on immigration was embodied in an act of August 3 , 1882 , excluding criminals , paupers , convicts , and insane persons .  |p509  for political " pull " in appointments to the Federal service and to safeguard the government employees from dismissal for the refusal to contribute a percentage of their salaries to the party funds . The President was authorized to appoint a bipartisan commission of three men to aid and advise him in the classification of the grades of service and to supervise a system of competitive examinations by which the candidates might qualify for appointments . Political assessments were forbidden , and no one was to be removed from office for failure to make a " voluntary " contribution to a political campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform by appointing as chairman of the Civil Service Commission Dorman B. Eaton , who had drafted the Pendleton Bill , and by placing in the classified service 15,573 government posts , vacancies in which should be filled by selection from a list of the four highest names in the respective competitive examinations . While the act of 1883 applied only to future appointments and left almost 90 per cent of the Federal offices still subject to the spoils system , its provision for future enlargements of the classified list enabled later presidents ? notably Cleveland , Roosevelt , Taft , and Wilson ? to place a majority of Federal officeholders under the merit system . It was one of the finest pieces of legislation ever put upon our statute books , justly called by the publicist Ostrogorski " the Magna Carta of civil-service reform . " Unfortunately no such praise can be given to the tariff legislation of 1883 , which was only a feeble stop-gap designed to prevent more drastic reform . The tariff commission of nine members , appointed in May , 1882 , traveled through the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the protective system . In spite of the fact that its chairman , John L. Hayes of Massachusetts , was the secretary of the National Association of Wool Manufacturers , and that several other members were the avowed representatives of the protected interests of iron , wool , and sugar , the commission recommended " a substantial reduction of tariff duties . " But Congress was not disposed to delegate its  |p510  privilege of drafting legislation . Bills carrying duties higher than those which the commission proposed were prepared in both houses , and a conference committee finally reported a " compromise " bill which just squeezed through the Senate . It was a farcical procedure , which clearly revealed that neither party in Congress favored tariff reform . The bill , which President Arthur signed on March 2 , 1883 , left the general level of customs duties practically unchanged , although it reduced the surplus by removing a number of internal-revenue taxes . The Democratic House , which assembled in December , 1883 , made two attempts , both futile , to revise the tariff schedules . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Arthur 's administration ? of traveling commissions and conference committees and heated debates in Congress ? was an act reducing the rates approximately 2 per cent ! Before the barren session of 1884 came to an end in July the country was absorbed in the quadrennial turmoil of a presidential campaign . President Arthur was and the an eager aspirant for the Republican nomination , but there was little prospect of his receiving it . In the first place , the Stalwarts resented his defection from their ranks . Secondly , he had been unable to gain the support of the Half-Breeds after removing Blaine from the State Department . Thirdly , he had not lowered the dignity of his high office by using the patronage to build up a political machine for himself . And , finally , the party had suffered serious reverses under his administration , though not through his fault . His Secretary of the Treasury , Charles J. Folger , had been defeated for the governorship of New York in 1882 by Grover Cleveland . On the other hand , the way seemed cleared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . The Stalwart opposition which had blocked his nomination in 1880 had melted away . " Boss " Platt was actually at the Republican convention in Chicago , spreading the word that it was " Blaine 's turn now . " Only Logan of Illinois remained of the old Stalwart guard to contest the nomination , and  |p511  after receiving 63 votes on the first ballot he was content to take the second place on the ticket . But there was opposition to Blaine from the delegates representing the reform element in the party . Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and George William Curtis of New York were prominent among them , as well as young Theodore Roosevelt , who was serving his third year in the New York Assembly . Feeling that Blaine would be a vulnerable candidate , obliged to wage a defensive campaign against attacks on his record , they supported Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont , chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary , a man of sterling character and imposing dignity . But he lacked that personal appeal which made men burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Blaine . He was nicknamed " the presidential glacier " at the convention . Not even a union of the Edmunds and Arthur forces , however , could have prevented the nomination of the popular Blaine . He was the " man of destiny . " On the fourth ballot he was nominated amid a pandemonium of cheers . No sooner had Blaine been nominated than the independents began to compass his defeat . They called upon the Democrats to select a reform candidate to whom they could give their support . Over the protests of Tammany Hall and the spoilsman generally the Democratic convention responded by nominating Grover Cleveland , the governor of New York . Cleveland was as complete an antithesis to Blaine as could be imagined . There was not a trace of the histrionic in his nature . He had none of the ingratiating arts of the politician . He cared less , perhaps , than any other statesman in our history for the effects of his official acts upon his own political fortunes . He was deliberate in the formation of his opinions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Buffalo , sheriff of Erie County , and governor of the state of New York , he was unswervingly faithful to his own political motto , " Public office is a public trust . " Two weeks after Cleveland 's nomination a convention of more than five hundred independent Republicans , representing sixteen states , condemned Blaine as an " unfit leader " and issued a call for all the friends of reform to vote for  |p512  Cleveland , whose name was " a synonym of political courage and honesty . " Not all the men who had opposed Blaine 's nomination bolted the ticket . Lodge , Roosevelt , and Senator Edmunds himself gave it grudging support . But a host of influential Republican writers and speakers , including Carl Schurz , Henry Ward Beecher , Samuel Bowles , and President Eliot of Harvard , worked for Cleveland . Republican and independent papers , like the New York Times , the Philadelphia Record , the Chicago News , and the New York Evening Post , gave him their support . These Republican followers of Cleveland were called " mugwumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 Since the platforms of both parties were noncommittal on all subjects except mutual condemnation , the campaign degenerated into an exhibition of personal abuse , which the New York Nation said was " worthy of the stairways of a tenement house . " Cleveland was pictured as a sot and a libertine , a vulgar politician transferred from the back parlor of a Buffalo saloon to the executive mansion at Albany . Blaine was coarsely cartooned as the " tattooed man , " decorated with worthless railroad bonds , fraudulent contracts , and compromising letters . The story of his transactions with the Union Pacific and the Little Rock and Fort Smith railroads rose like Banquo 's ghost to plague him . Years earlier , while a member of the House , Blaine had written to an official of the Little Rock and Fort Smith expressing gratitude for being " admitted to participation " in certain enterprises , in his " present state of crippled and deranged finances , " and promising in return that he would not be a " deadhead " in the business . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter , just before the meeting of the national convention of 1876 , and James Mulligan of Boston testified that letters from Blaine were in footnote 1 This epithet was first used by the Indianapolis Sentinel in the Liberal Republican campaign of 1872 , but it did not become a common term in our political vocabulary until it was applied to the Cleveland Republicans by Charles A. Dana in the New York Sun ( which supported the Anti-Monopoly candidate , Benjamin F. Butler , in 1884 ) .  |p513  his possession , Blaine , much perturbed , " borrowed " them from Mulligan and refused to return them . Instead he read such parts of them as he wished in the House a few days later , while inviting the confidence of forty-four million of his countrymen . Though this audacious gesture carried the House off its feet , it did not satisfy all the forty-four million of Blaine 's innocence . Neither did the perusal of the letters in cold print as they appeared in the Congressional Record . Now , eight years later , the Mugwump leaders republished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hoping to counteract this attack on his record with the magnetism of his personal appeal , Blaine made a speaking tour through the Middle West during the last weeks of the campaign . He returned to New York , tired and overwrought , to meet with an experience which probably cost him the election . A group of clergymen gathered at the Fifth Avenue Hotel on October 29 to pledge him their support . Their spokesman , Reverend S. D. Burchard , had the effrontery to refer to the Democrats as " the party of rum , Romanism , and rebellion . " If Blaine heard the remark , he made a fatal mistake in not rebuking Burchard in his response . The insulting alliteration was featured by the anti-Blaine press and justly resented by every Catholic voter in the state . The same evening Blaine gave further cause for criticism by attending a " millionaires ' dinner " at Delmonico 's and hobnobbing with such conspicuous representatives of predatory wealth as Jay Gould , Russell Sage , H. H. Rogers , and P. D. Armour . The result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Cleveland carried the doubtful states of Connecticut , New Jersey , and Indiana , which , with the solid South , gave him 183 electoral votes , while Blaine had the 182 votes of all the other states except New York . Several days passed after the balloting before complete returns showed that Cleveland had carried his own state by the slight plurality of 1149 votes out of a total poll of 1,127,169 . The defeat of Blaine was attributed to various causes the Mugwump revolt , the Burchard incident , the Mulligan letters , the last flicker of  |p514  Stalwart revenge in Conkling 's refusal to support his old rival , the commercial depression of 1884 , and the bad weather on election day . Blaine himself attributed his defeat directly to the misfortune that " the Lord sent upon us ? an Ass in the shape of a Preacher , and a rainstorm to lessen our vote in New York , " 2 and indirectly to the lawless defiance of the South in suppressing the Negro Republican vote . That Blaine was weaker than his party was shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House and retained their control of the Senate by a slightly increased margin . THE RETURN OF THE DEMOCRATS TO POWER The Republicans greeted the advent of Grover Cleveland in 1885 with dismal prophecies of national ruin , as the Federalists had done on the accession of Thomas Jefferson in 1801 . The fruits of the war would he sacrificed ; the Democratic South would dominate the government ; the reforming zeal of the new president would upset political precedents and disturb legitimate business enterprise . In reality , Cleveland found himself hopelessly at variance with his Democratic House on the question of reform in taxation , the currency , and the civil service , while a Republican Senate confronted him with hostile defiance throughout his entire term . He was the elected president , but not the accepted leader of the country . Frustration was the keynote of his administration , as it had been of Arthur 's . In determining the personnel of his administration President Cleveland was largely guided by his resolution that sectional discrimination in the distribution of Federal offices should cease . It was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the stump for Blaine , Conkling had replied with quiet sarcasm , " You know I do n't engage in criminal practice . " 2 The 24,999 votes cast in New York for the Prohibition party candidate , J. P. St. John of Kansas , were drawn largely from the rural up-state counties , which normally were Republican strongholds . The Blaine supporters insisted that the fraudulent counting of Butler votes for Cleveland in various New York districts had robbed their candidate of his victory .  |p515  reinstated in Congress , had their share in the higher administrative posts of the government . Cleveland appointed as Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard of the border state of Delaware . For Secretary of the Interior he named L. Q. C. Lamar of Mississippi , who had shown his devotion to the restored Union by a touching eulogy on Charles Sumner , delivered in the Senate in 1874 . His Attorney-General was Augustus H. Garland , ex-governor of the secessionist state of Arkansas . ' The President redressed the balance in the diplomatic and consular offices by dividing the seventy posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests in the Senate against sending abroad to represent the United States government " Confederate brigadier generals " who had been fighting for its dissolution a score of years earlier . As a sincere advocate of civil-service reform , Cleveland had promised George William Curtis , president of the National Civil Service League , that he would enforce the Pendleton Act " in good faith and without evasion , " making removals from the classified service only in cases of " offensive partisanship . " But there were over 100,000 offices outside the classified service , and the pressure of a party excluded for a quarter of a century from the rich pastures of government patronage proved too strong for the reform President . Hundreds of Democratic politicians , encouraged by Vice President Hendricks , demanded that Cleveland make a clean sweep of the Republican incumbents . A popular cartoon of the day represented the President , with a club , confronting the snarling Tammany tiger and warned by the legend " Beware ! for he is very hungry and very thirsty . " In the postal service the First Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headsman 's ax with vigor . Reluctantly the President yielded to the pressure of his party . Eventually all the 85 internal-revenue collectors , 100 out of the 110 collectors of the customs , and 4 out of every 5 of the land footnote 1 The other members of the cabinet included : Secretary of the Treasury , Daniel Manning of New York ; Secretary of the Navy , William C. Whitney of New York ; Secretary of War , William C. Endicott of Massachusetts ; Postmaster-General , William F. Vilas of Wisconsin .
