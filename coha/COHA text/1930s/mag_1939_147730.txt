Although the Roman Catholic Church hates war as much as the next Christian , its attitude towards war has always been realistic . Modern simon-pure pacifism , as unrealistic as it is high-minded , has been fostered more by Protestants than by Catholics . Yet as World War II began to loom , widespread signs of pacifist leanings appeared among U. S. Catholics . At first , the pacifism of such leaders as Bishop John Aloysius Duffy of Buffalo had a narrow basis : fear that Catholics might be called upon to fight as allies of the U. S. S. R. With that fear removed , there remained the fact that this seemed to be England 's war-and most U. S. Catholic churchmen are of Irish origin . <P> Last week it appeared that 1,000,000 U. S. Protestant pacifists ( the estimate of peace groups ) might have to move over on the bandwagon to make room for some Catholics . Evidence during the fortnight : <P> &gt;If the U. S. enters the war , Catholics should " give serious thought to the question of whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Joseph Beckman of Dubuque , who helped Father Coughlin in his unsuccessful keep-the-embargo fight . <P> &gt;If the U. S. enters the war , only 20% of young Catholics would volunteer , 44% submit to conscription , while 36% would conscientiously object . So suggested America ( Jesuit weekly ) on the basis of a poll of 54,000 students ( both sexes ) in 141 Catholic colleges and universities . <P> &gt;If the U. S. enters the war , if Roman Catholics are drafted , and if they are not fully certain of the justice of the war , they must conscientiously object , " under pain of mortal sin . " So , in the pacifist Catholic Worker , wrote Monsignor George Barry O'Toole , Catholic University philosophy professor . Said he : " Nowadays justification for an offensive war is practically impossible-the presumption is totally against it . Only if the Holy Father , whose decision in moral matters is infallible , were to call a crusade , could we be certain that sufficient justification existed . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
