One of the few genuine pacifists left in the U. S. is Senator Lynn Joseph Frazier of Hoople , N. Dak . As usual when Congress opened , Senator Frazier offered an amendment to the Constitution , declaring : <P> " War for any purpose shall be illegal and neither the United States nor any State , Territory , association , or person subject to its jurisdiction shall prepare for , declare , engage in , or carry on war or other armed conflict , expedition , invasion or undertaking within or without the United States , nor shall any funds be raised , appropriated , or expended for such purpose . " <P> Never since 1917 was such a proposal more out of keeping with U. S. temper than last week . Hurry up calls from Washington sent Ambassadors Joseph P. Kennedy ( London ) and William Bullitt ( Paris ) hustling back to the White House from vacations in Florida . Ambassadors rarely appear before Congressional committees , and then only before foreign affairs committees . But Messrs . Kennedy &; Bullitt were promptly closeted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House &; Senate Military Affairs Committees . <P> " Secret " Congressional hearings are seldom secret long . Duly published were reports that Messrs . Kennedy &; Bullitt foresaw war in Europe within the year , that Germany has 6,500 new planes , 3,000 usable old ones , and can build 1,200 a month . Explaining that French resistance to Mussolini held the chief threat of war , Mr. Kennedy was reported as saying that in order to appease Adolf Hitler the British would even allow him to put a base in Canada ( which Franklin Roosevelt swears to defend ) . This Mr. Kennedy quickly denied . A story he did not deny was that much of his information came from Hero Charles Lindbergh ( TIME , Jan. 16 ) . <P> " Who 's going to fight ? " snorted North Carolina 's irrepressible Senator Robert Rice Reynolds , doubting that France and England would risk a war . But many of his colleagues were impressed by the Kennedy-Bullitt stories , and Congress was aquiver by the time Franklin Roosevelt sent up his message telling why and for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army and $720,000,000 for the Navy provided by the regular budget . <P> Program . To finance " a minimum program for the necessities of defense , " Franklin Roosevelt asked Congress to appropriate $552,000,000 extra . For : <P> &gt; " A minimum increase " of 3,000 Army planes-$300,000,000 . <P> &gt; " Critical " Army equipment ( guns &; ammunition of which the Army is particularly short ) - $110,000,000 . <P> &gt; " Educational orders , " promoted by Assistant Secretary of War Louis Johnson , to enable industry to prepare for quantity production of war materials in emergency - $32,000,000 . <P> &gt; Strengthening " the seacoast defenses of Panama , Hawaii and the continental U. S. " - $8,000,000 . <P> &gt; Financing the first year 's primary training of 20,000 citizen-pilots in commercial schools-$10,000,000 . <P> &gt; Increasing and re-housing the present garrison of 13,000 in the Panama Canal Zone-$27,000,000 . <P> &gt; Extending and strengthening the Navy 's bases in Pacific and Atlantic-$44,000,000 . <P> &gt; Additional Navy planes ( about 200 ) and aviation research-$21,000,000.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
