txt Objections to the Bridge More Details About Battery Span Are Wanted Before Estimate Hearing TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : If the hearing before the Board of Estimate on the Brooklyn-Battery bridge , set for June 8 , is to be of any value , more information should be given the public than the mere draft of a proposed contract between the city and the Triborough Bridge Authority . This contract can not become effective until Chairman Moses of the Authority files with the Mayor a certificate that the War Department has approved the location and plans of the bridge , and that " the Authority has made an agreement for the sale 00 its bonds which will adequately provide for the financing by " the Authority " of the expense to be borne by it . " The contract provides that the Authority will , at its own expense ( 1 ) complete the West Side elevated express highway from Duane Street to Morris Street , with connections to South Street ' and then to the bridge , ( 2 ) build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn , and ( 4 ) reimburse the city for all land to be acquired for approaches from the West Side Highway and for Hamilton Avenue highways . The Authority also agrees to " develop " Battery Park , provided the cost does not exceed $500,000 . The contract makes no provision for the continuation of the East Side Highway from Montgomery Street . It has been stated repeatedly that this will cost $7,500,000 , and so far as appears it will fall on the city . Specific Figures Sought Mr. Moses states that to comply with the requirements of the War Department he must add to the cost of the bridge $2,800,000 . This item has not been broken down , nor has the original estimate of $41,200,000 ; or if they have the breakdown , it has not been disclosed to the public . A public hearing without specific detailed figures furnished in advance will only darken counsel . May I add that if the new plan meets the objections of the War Department and is approved by the bankers and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , the objections based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast increase in traffic in the financial district and the so-called esthetic objections still hold . As to the effect of a bridge on the value of real estate , we have ample experience with other bridges . It may seem extraordinary that taxpayers have not made themselves heard . Large owners are proverbially timid , fearing , without reason , reprisals in assessment values . It is significant that no Manhattan taxpayer has expressed approval of the bridge . As to traffic , it should be observed that at Morris Street the Manhattan approach from the bridge swings down to the street , and traffic bound east is to pass under Battery Place and on reaching through an open cut the street level in Battery Park . will pass between the legs of the approach until it reaches Whitehall Street , over which it must climb . Esthetic Considerations The esthetic objections should be distinguished  --  the injury to Battery Park is one thing , the effect on the view of the city from the bay quite another . The new plan is for two bridges , not one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at an angle , with lower towers . As to Battery Park  --  let any one go down to Bowling Green and look at the unsightly elevated . The new highway express approach will be twice as high and three times as wide . The graphic picture prepared by three architects and published in The Sun May 20 shows how this structure would look from the Battery . Other pictures showing its appearance from Broadway and Bowling Green have been prepared but have not yet been published in the papers . Chacun h. son gout , as the French say . If Mr. Moses thinks that an obelisk , a fountain or what he calls armillary spheres would damage Battery Park , we must leave him to the aberrations of his own taste . No one can blame Brooklyn or her politicians for wishing to be more closely connected with Manhattan , but this enterprise will not aid Brooklyn financially or commercially . It will afford an admirable means for motorists to reach the ocean without traversing the mazes and masses of the Borough of Homes and Churches . CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teachers ' Position Defended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : G. Alvin Landau 's letter to THE TIMES is a very good example of the many misconceptions that exist in the public mind apropos teachers , their salaries , their responsibilities and educational matters in general . In the first place , Mr. Landau is entirely wrong when he says that teachers ' salaries were not reduced during the depression years . It is a matter of record that by means of pay cuts , enforced furloughs and voluntary contributions the educational staff of New York City contributed more than $35 , - 000,000 toward easing the burden of the taxpayer . Certainly , that is a very substantial sum to come from one-half of 1 per cent of the population . Secondly , there is no particular reason why teachers , above all others , should be called upon to prove their patriotism , as Mr. Landau insists , by accepting periodic reductions in their pay , the average of which is far from being the " swollen " sum that Mr. Landau pictures . Teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bought and sold by the pound or measured by the percentage of their salaries that they may or may not be willing to be deprived of . Finally , the teachers ' lobbies that Mr. Landau abominates are in no wise worse than taxpayers ' lobbies or merchants ' lobbies that were rushed to Albany to exert pressure in order to sway legislation in favor of economy . To pay lip-service to education as one of the foundation stones of our democ- ' , racy and then speak in the derogatory , and contemptuous tone of those who ! are charged with the task of laying that stone straight and true is but one morel , instance of the mental dichotomy that is the bane of present-day thinking .

Pump-Priming Is Opposed Canada 's Action Is Cited as Method of : Stimulating Industry To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TD.IES : There is renewed talk of ; government : pump-priming , in spite of its failure in the past six years to stimulate private ' ? enterprise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thist and plans are being prepared for thcii , government to take over their functions , to show them how they should fulfill ; their duty to the community , even if it involves more competition of govern- ? , merit with business . The curious thing about the New Deal ? is that it has not the courage of its own . convictions , for if it had it would advo- ' cate eight billions of deficit spending in one year , as that was the amount ofl , new corporate financing in 1929 , when we had a national income of eighty billion dollars , which is the New Deal. , goal . In 1938 the volume of new corporate , .4 , financing was only about one-tenth as ! much and of government deficit spend- ; , ing a picayune 1.4 billions , contrasted ' : with a peak of over four billions in ; 1936 , all of which proves that the New Deal has never had any real confidence in pump-priming and knows that if it ? should suggest eight billions of deficit spending in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to produce the national income at which it is aiming , . it would be laughed at by the whole , country . The one thing that New Dealers can not ' seem to see is that the only justification for a government or an indi- , vidual going into debt for the sake of stimulating business is when money can be invested in enterprises which are ; sure to be self-liquidating . Government , debt which means more taxes is always deflationary . Our politicians ought to look around , them occasionally and see how other , ' . countries are solving their unemplOy- , ment problem . Canada has not listened to the siren voice of J. M. Keynes , who , sold Mr. Roosevelt the pump-priming idea , and as a result business conditions in the Dominion have been much better than they have been here for several years .

Cutting the Budget TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial describing the mythical White House guest who finds himself unable to make a suggestion as to where to cut the budget reminds me of my own experience . My employer came ' to me and asked me where I could cut my personal budget . We went over the items one by one and neither of us could find one item in which a cut could possibly be made . In fact , I was able to show where certain budget items deserved to be raised . However , my employer was tougher than the President 's employer . He just said , " Well , your salary is going to be cut 20 per cent just the same . " After he was gone , I took my mythical book and I cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of it , the more I feel that this is quite a workable scheme . G. F. Albany , May 26 , 1939 . Written While Hot TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : What the blue blazes are we paying this alleged Weather Bureau for ? Every day it says showers and cooler , and every day it is dryer and hotter . I have no doubt but that the Weather Bureau is just ducky for fliers , deep-sea divers and diamond-cutters , but what use is it to the rest of us if it ca n't do better than this ? Doubtless this bureau will say that there have been showers and that it has been cooler within a hundred miles ; but since we paid nearly thirty dollars to the Indians for this ghastly island , of which I am a native , it does seem to me that we might do at least as well as the Indians did in the way of weather prophecy . But we do n't : we do worse . EDWARD HALE BIERSTADT . New York , May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YORK TIMES : Going by the predictions of the Weather Bureau , I carried an umbrella on eight occasions , had no use for it and lost it in the bargain . Three forecasts of clear weather caught me without an umbrella and I came home soaked . Ca n't we get the truth from any one ? WILLIAM GROEDEL . New York , May 31 , 1939 . Trees for Fifth Avenue To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The marked improvement in beauty of that portion of Fifth Avenue which recently acquired a few trees should encourage the speedy planting of more trees up and down the avenue . The shopkeepers must , of course , be considered and the kind of tree selected which will not , obscure the window displays . An occasional bench would not only add to the comfort of the pedestrian , but also to the picturesque aspect of the avenue , and the project would serve the utilitarian purpose of furnishing jobs for a few more members of the army of the unemployed .
