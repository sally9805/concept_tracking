The Press Gets a Code THE REQUIREMENT that they sign and . abide by a code under the National Recovery Act is probably the most annoying thing that has happened to American newspaper publishers in. the past forty years . Thousands of them regard it as nothing more nor less than an outrage ; it is the end of the Constitution and a Cossack inva ? sion of their private right , never heretofore ques ? timed , to enter unilateral contracts with their em ? ployees in the editorial departments , the employees to be subject to instant discharge at any and all times for any reason or none . No wonder the publishers raise the issue of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press ! Of course it has no bearing upon regulation of hours and terms of employment under the National Re ? covery Act , but they would n't know that . Not one in fifty has been an editor nor would one in a thou ? sand recognize a clear-cut issue of freedom of the press under constitutional guarantee if it confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rudely shocked by the unionization of their printers , who imposed and enforced terms of employment that transformed them from drunken tramps to sober , home-owning citizens , and now they are threatened with curtailment of their uncounted thousands of child laborers and loss of their right to discharge reporters and editors or cut their wages at will . The Red menace is at their door I No doubt the public discussion of the code ( which is still pending as this is written ) has brought to light facts that surprised many readers . I am sure they must find it hard to believe that these great institutions for spreading light and up ? lift were themselves far from model employers . On that point I have been amazed that politicians and business institutions such as the U. S. Steel Con , poration when under attack never replied with a few salient facts about employment conditions on newspapers . Ignorance must account for the over ? sight , because the facts have always been available , facts that would have exploded like a sixteen-inch shell . I recall that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on The San Antonio Express of San Antonio , . Texas , I was informed that my wage would be seven dollars a week and my hours from half-past noon until midnight , with Sundays off . I worked one year without a day off . My hours were from half-past noon until half-past two o'clock the fol ? lowing morning , which is to say fourteen hours a day seven days a week . From time to time I would get so tired that I simply could not stumble down to the office and would spend the day in bed . I was always docked for the lost day . This condition was common among newspapers outside of the very largest cities , and to a considerable extent still is . Any worker in the editorial department was ex ? pected to give two weeks ' notice when he wished to resign , and to the best of my knowledge all did dur ? ing the sixteen years that I spent in newspaper work , but only a very few newspapers ever gave notice when they discharged a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanted that day or any other day . Some of the more humane publishers had been troubled by the suffering this caused . They were also moved by the annoyance to their other employees when discharged men hung around trying to borrow small sums with which to buy food , and the more progressive discovered a remedy . They did not pay a new man his wages for the first two weeks so that when he finally left , usually discharged , he would get the two weeks ' wages that had been withheld . This custom was common in the Middle West for a quarter of a century and , I think , still is . I have been told that it was initiated by The Kansas City Star and I have heard it highly praised by newspapermen unaccus ? tomed to such thoughtfulness from publishers . The first time my pay was ever cut on account of hard times ( and the times really were hard ) I walked into the business office and was handed my pay envelope and discovered to my embarrassment that it was 10-percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assumed it to be a clerical error likely to cause a great deal of trouble . But the cashier calmly informed me that it was no error at all ; wages had been cut 10 percent . No one had been told anything about this . The heads of the institution were as gentlemanly a group as I have ever known in the newspaper world . What they did seemed perfectly natural to them because no one had ever heard of such a thing as an edi ? torial-department laborer having any rights . I an ? nounced at once and in no uncertain terms that I would have the rest of my money instantly or I would start a campaign of throat-cutting that ould n't leave manpower enough around the place get out a newspaper . Then I took my missing 10 percent and went upstairs to gather up my few belongings and go elsewhere to seek a job . But no re was angry with me and everyone who knew any ing about what happened was amused . They put e down as a hot-headed kid from Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newspaperdom . I tried to explain that they would have a perfect right to cut my wage for the follow ? ing week if they so elected and would give notice , but that to cut for the week already past seemed to me precisely like stealing . Well , that was funny . Nevertheless I declined to get to work until as ? sured that I would receive my full wage the follow ? ing week . They actually argued with me that to quit then and there was very , very wrong . I should give two weeks ' notice . But I would n't , so they promised that my wage would n't be cut , and it was n't . Since then my wages have been cut because of business conditions several times and never once with advance notice . I do not know what experi4 ence others may have had with wage cuts , but cer ? tainly I never have been notified one second in advance . Usually the printers would know what the situation was because the publisher generally made the mistake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They never did . And the result was that the publisher found the money to pay them . I have also seen pay day pass by with no pay envelopes distributed , but I have never been informed of this coming event by a publisher nor have I ever heard from one under such circum ? stances one word of apology , explanation or regret . The reader will please keep in mind that none of this refers to New York City , Chicago , Phila ? delphia , Boston or any other of the major cities . If it did , I should not consider it worth writing ; I am telling what I know of the general run of news ? paper employment where the vast majority of news ? papermen in this country are working , in the medium-sized and smaller communities . I have been managing editor , city editor , chief editorial writer and star staff man repeatedly , but I never at any time made the amount of money ordinarily earned by a union printer on those very newspapers at that time . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hated union printers as much as they did . They assumed that I would dislike the printers because they received larger pay envelopes than mine . Well , they were wrong . I did n't . I envied the printers . They , too , had been wandering tramps only a decade or so be ? fore I entered newspaper work , but now they could actually buy homes on the instalment plan , while in the editorial department I saw , month after month , the procession of brilliant young men wending their way from nowhere to nowhere , stopping a while but never calling the place home . Those who were go ? ing to amount to anything got out . One more story of newspaper work and wages and I close . This is such high comedy that I should hesitate to tell it if every person involved were not still able to testify . A friend of mine was sent as staff writer to Mexico City to do a series of feature articles , but revolution broke out suddenly so he gave that his attention instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cable office with shells exploding all around him and , for that mat ? ter , over a considerable part of the city . He could n't get out , but what a stroke of luck to be marooned in the cable office ! He remained there for a week with the artillery busy all that time . No other news ? paperman could reach the place . He scooped the world and his paper sold his dispatches to many other newspapers , garnering thereby much profit . It also did a prosperous business in extra editions . On his return , however , my friend found himself unable to make out his expense account because he had sent messengers through shell fire to get food at all hours of the day and night . He had had almost no sleep for a week and he was a nervous wreck . Be . ing a painstaking , meticulous person it grieved him to discover that neither notes nor memory would account for all of his expenditures , so he went to the business manager and confessed that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had certainly spent , but could n't remember . " That 's all right , my boy , " said the kindly chief executive . " You did a grand job and we appreciate it . We will not take the fifty dollars out of your first week 's salary because that might leave you short . We will just take it out five dollars a week , for ten weeks , so you run along and do n't give it another thought . " CHESTER T. CROWELL . Washington Notes Tardy Words on the Saloon ? The Right Enemies ? Liberals and Conservatives at It Again ? The Great Peacemaker N OW THAT the repeal excitement is subsiding , it is possible to look at certain more or less curious phases of the situation . One which seems to me particularly interesting and not without its humorous slant is that the really sore people should be not the leading Drys but the leading Vets ? especially the Democratic Wets . The thing , of course , that annoys them so intensely is that they made their entire campaign in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and confining the functions of the federal government to the prevention of rum-running and the protection of the Dry states . Now they find that the Democratic President , elected on this pledge , has established a federal control over the manufacture , sale and distribution of liquor far more drastic and complete than the Republican proposal which they so bitterly denounced . They writhe un ? happily under the new edict , point out that it is a complete violation of the platform pledge , that it sets up a bureaucracy which can easily become as offensive as prohibition enforce ? ment and will he equally susceptible to corruption and abuse . The more conspicuous members of the old Anti-Prohibition Association , such as Mr. Shouse and Mr. Du ? pont , feel exceedingly bitter about it and warn of trouble . A large number of people are puzzled as to how Mr. Roosevelt can get away with such a complete reversal of form as is involved in the establishment of a system the mere suggestion of which aroused Wet Democrats to fury while he was running for President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the President 's temperance sermon to the country , de ? livered as part of his official proclamation , and which so many of the Washington correspondents enthusiastically described as without precedent . Of course it was without REPUBL C December precedent , no such occasion ever having been paten before to a President . And , of course , no one could d anything but agree with the Roosevelt exhortation people not to indulge in alcoholic excess , to be and well behaved . The really remarkable part o proclamation , however , was the earnest appeal of the dent to the states not to restore the saloon . And this was remarkable chiefly because it came after all of the state which wanted the saloon ? and a good many of them did had already restored it by law . What I am trying to say is that Mr. Roosevelt 's request to bar the saloon was futile and hollow , and it is difficult to see how the man could make it in the face of the facts . However , these are details and Mr. Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his platform pledge in the federal control over liquor , or the absurd ? ity of asking states which had already restored the saloon not to restore it . The fact is that so long as Mr. Roose ? velt is actively identified in the public mind as battling with the crooked international bankers and the ' Wall Street in ? terests , he need not bother about little matters of con ? sistency , or whether this or that past of the New Deal program is operating too percent . So long as Father Coughlin and William Randolph Hearst picture him to the masses as the foe of the " blood money " plunderers of Wall Street ; and so long as the Sen ? ate Committee , with his backing , continues to reveal our leading financiers as greedy tricksters , escaping payment of their taxes by crawling through legal loopholes ; so long as the administration policy toward more and more rigid regulation of the banks and the stock market continues to be followed ? so long as these things go on , Mr. Roosevelt 's popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and criticism , of which there seems to be an in ? creasing supply . Regardless of the merits of his policies , the mistakes he has made and is making , and the dissatis ? faction with some of his department chiefs , the people are largely with him and no politician keen enough to judge local sentiment has any doubt about it . Moreover , those capable of analysis know that the basis for this public senti ? ment is in the administration attitude toward the great banking interests by which the country has so long been dominated and which have controlled so many of our Presi ? dents . The plain fact is that Mr. Roosevelt has arrayed himself against the most unpopular and generally distrusted element we have . It is the real source of his strength and it may as well be recognized . Early last week , the daily press was full of reports that the conflict between progressives and conservatives in the Roosevelt administration was rapidly coming to a head and that wholesale resignations among the progressives were not at all unlikely . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made another of his characteristically adroit com ? promises . He has settled much of the dispute between George N. Peek the the Wallace-Tugwell-Frank group by taking out of the Agricultural Adjustment Administra ? tion a number of the codes and transferring them to the N.R.A . The only ones left are those covering the " first processors " of agricultural products and middlemen who handle them before the first processing .
