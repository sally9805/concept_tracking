txt Major LAGUARDIA has declared that from the moment he enters the City Hall as Mayor ? if he does ? he will be " out of politics . " He meant , of course , out of State or national politics . They ought to be kept out of a municipal election , if for no other reason in order to comply with the plain design of the Constitution of the State of New York . President BUTLER on Friday evening recalled the fact that the State Constitutional Convention of 1895 , although it had a Republican majority , " corn " witted our party to the separation of " municipal from State and Federal " elections . " The principle involved was that the government of cities should be treated purely as a matter of honest , intelligent and capable business administration . In the present campaign , fairness compels the admission that the Republicans have lived up to their pledge . They have agreed to support a Fusion ticket largely made up of independent Democrats . They have left Mr. LAGUARDIA 'S hands entirely free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand of him . Yet when distinguished Republicans and leaders in the party organization meet to reaffirm their loyalty to the promises they made at the beginning of the Fusion movement , a cry goes up from the headquarters that a nefarious Republican " plot " has at last been uncovered . The Fusion ticket , it is asserted , is only a blind for a Republican scheme to gain control of the City of New York and from that entrenched political base make a partisan attack upon President ROOSEVELT . In other words , the intimation is that when Republicans stand up and make oath to their good faith they are unblushing perjurers . It is a pretty hollow pretense . In the very act there is a tacit admission of resorting to a mere political trick . If a candidate finds that he is losing ground , let him seek to ride into office on the popularity of President ROOSEVELT . Make the contest in this city not between rivals for the Mayoralty , but between the national Democratic leader at Washington and the next possible Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , it would reduce the municipal election to almost as low and imbecile a level as that of 1917 , when , according to the campaign slogans of that year , the great question before the voters of this city was whether they would permit the Hohenzollerns to occupy the City Hall . It is a sardonic comment upon this charge that the Republicans are injecting national politics into the city campaign that the campaign is managed by the Democratic Collector of the Port . He is loudest in railing at the Republicans for their under-cover partisanship . His own partisanship has not a rag to cover it . He is abandoning or neglecting the duties of his Federal office in order to bring about the election of a city official . The force of inconsistency and of impropriety could no further go . It is strange that the President , who declared himself absolutely " neutral " in this city campaign , does not restrain the offensive activities of this subordinate of his .               @ @ @ @ @ @
