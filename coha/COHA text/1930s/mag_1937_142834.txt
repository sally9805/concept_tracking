While hotspots from coast-to-coast observed moments of silence in her memory , while Broadway pitchmen hawked little copper medals stamped with her image and a Hollywood boy was gnawed by a 15-in. rat which crept up his pants during a memorial revival of one of her pictures , the late Jean Harlow went to her last rest last week in a manner which has come to be regarded by the film colony as quiet , conventional good taste . With a reliable force of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer company detectives on guard to see that there was no repetition of the mob scenes at Rudolph Valentino 's obsequies in 1926 , the body of Miss Harlow lay on a couch in the Tennyson Room of Pierce Brothers Mortuary , Hollywood 's largest . A portrait of the author of In Memoriam and a volume of his verse were arranged , as usual , nearby . In a " very beautiful but not overly expensive casket " purchased by the late star 's mother , Mrs. Jean Bello , Miss Harlow 's remains were taken to Forest Lawn Memorial Park 's Wee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's most extraordinary cemetery , which has become , in the last decade , the Valhalla of the cinema business . <P> MGM , Glendale and Forest Lawn patrolmen kept the public well out of sight as 200 of Miss Harlow 's friends , relatives and colleagues gathered at the Wee Kirk , whose nave had been converted into a scented bower by $15,000 worth of flowers . Clark Gable , * Miss Harlow 's Business Manager Edward J. Mannix , MGM Producer Hunt Stromberg , Director Jack Conway , Cameraman Ray June , Director William S. Van Dyke were pallbearers . Jeanette MacDonald sang Indian Love Call . Nelson Eddy sang Ah , Sweet Mystery of Life . A Christian Science reader-practitioner named Mrs. Genevieve Smith , longtime friend of Miss Harlow , read from the Psalms and from Science &; Health by Mary Baker Eddy ( Nelson Eddy is no kin ) , recited the Lord 's Prayer and a trenchant 48-word eulogy . The body was then taken to a $25,000 mortuary chamber purchased by William Powell , the inconsolable actor who was to have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable interment at the institution which Promoter Hubert Eaton has made as indispensable to Hollywood 's great dead as a footprint in the cement at Sid Grauman 's Chinese Theatre is to its living . <P> Twenty years ago Forest Lawn was a debt-ridden , unprepossessing necropolis . Hubert Eaton , a realtor and onetime mining engineer , was assigned to manage it . He was immediately struck by the ugliness of its tombstones , by the fact that most cemeteries are " unsightly stoneyards , full of inartistic symbols and depressing customs . " Mr. Eaton placed a ban on stones , substituting bronze markers laid flush with the grass . He forsook the word " cemetery " for more euphonious Memorial Park . Today under his chairmanship it has expanded to 200 acres , contains in one form or another the dust of some 55,000 humans , with room for about 150,000 more , and is divided into sections with names like Babyland , Vale of Memory , Resthaven , Eventide , Slumberland.                 @ @ @ @
