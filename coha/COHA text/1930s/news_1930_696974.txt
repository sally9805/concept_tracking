txt We have a report from the geological party so interesting that am going to send it northward just as it came from Dr. Gould ( Lawrence M. Gould , leader of the nartvA I wonder if it is generally realized that this little unit of our expedition is as the crow flies further from us than Boston is from Richmond ? That is a very long distance in this country . They have just completed a trip of 110 miles to the eastward of their present base , so that when they reach here the last part of January they will have traveled by dog team about 1,200 miles since leaving Little America . Not one of the party has ever before explored with teams , but now every member of this party and the supporting party we consider veteran trail hitters . The grueling training came last Summer when the dogteam men , most of whom had never before driven a team , . arried hundreds of tons of mategial over eight miles of the treacherous bay ice . Even now it does not seem possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the trail hitters have . done more than they set out to do .. The reason is easy to find . It is the spirit they put into their task , and some of them began to lick the job over . two years ago when three young men of Boston , three college friends , went on their own initiative to the Walden farm in New Hampshire to learn about dogs  | qualify themselves to help me . Trained Arduously for Tasks . For months they lived in a little shack and cooked their own meals . Now these three musketeers , Norman Vaughan , Eddie Goodale and Fred Crockett , are out there in the mountains doing their stuff with Larry Gould , Mike Thorne and Jack O'Brien . For eight months these fellows and the supporting party practiced skiing and planned and labored in preparation for the trip . The final plans contained forty typewritten sheets . There were many things they had to learn . Fred , for example , was given the job of making himself a radio operator . The results show how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobbler and rnade two pairs of excellent ski boots for Larry and himself for mid-Summer use . During the Winter months , the whole camp joined enthusiastically in making sleds , clothes , tents , cookers , sleeping bags , &c.,; for the trail parties . But the dog-team men , in addition to months of hard work in preparation themselves , did all the planning for their long and difficult journey and decided just what equipment would be most suitable . Now they have acquitted themselves brilliantly on the trail and have done even more than I asked or hoped . And so in this part of our work , as is the case with the many other branches of the expedition , my lob has been made easy by the spirit of my men . Message from Dr. Gould . This spirit is seen in the radio I have received from the leader of the geological party , likable , brilliant , able Larry Gould , and I leave it to him to tell of the very important geological discovery he has made : " Made trip to Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair near Amundsen 's cache . Weather permitting , we start northward for Little America tonight and shall be travelling at night from now on . " We are disreputable looking out- fit now for no one has washed or shaved since we left Little America . Norman looks.like an Italian bandit , Eddie like a Yankee farmer from far back In the woods , ' Mike a recent escape from Sing Sing , Obie a thug from any place , Freddy a Boy Scout trying to grow a beard , and I am said to resemble the dog , Rags . Do n't think you would be proud to own us as members of the expedition , but we are bringing back records which I hope you will be proud of . " Obie , Mike and I have roughly charted 150 miles of Queen Maud range . We have demonstrated that there is no Carmen Land , but that the range extends eastward beyond 140th meridian and therefore that the possibility of Ross and Weddell Seas being connected demands attennon again . Climbed Mountain for 6,000 Feet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my geolog1 ical studies will demonstrate that the great mountain ranges which take their rise far away on western side of Ross Sea are continued as major feature - of landscape in fairly unbroken fashion certainly as far az 140th meridian . " Capping Mount Nansen I did find sandstone with layer of highly carbonaceous material . This I am sure is beacon sandstone. - Had to climb up 6,000. feet in part over steep badly crevassed glacier to reach these cap rocks on Nansen . From distance had thought they were all volcanic rocks . " No symphonies I have ever heard , no work of art before which I. have stood in awe , ever gave me quite the thrill that I had when I reached out after this strenuous climb and picked up rock to find it- sandstone . Here was what I had come all way to Antarctic to find . " Eddie , Mike and Freddy who were with me will tell you that I even forgot to cuss . " Every one is happy , for we are heading back to you with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and perhaps a little more . In a splendor and beauty beyond realm of science the mountains and glaciers have exceeded our highest hopes , and we are all loath to ' leave them and the spell they have cast over us.
