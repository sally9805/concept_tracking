Late one afternoon last week Adolf Hitler stepped up on a platform in City Hall Square at Wilhelmshaven . German naval base on the North Sea . A few inches in front of him was a bullet-proof glass shield+ . Packed in the square beyond was an audience of 80,000 Heil-Hitlering Germans who had just attended the launching of the 35,000-ton battleship Von Tirpitz . Beyond them was a vast radio audience of millions in Germany , Britain , the U. S. waiting anxiously to hear a speech which had been widely heralded as the Fhrer 's answer to the bold , diplomatic anti-German moves by Britain , France , Poland . <P> Trembling with emotion , a discernible note of disappointment and frustration in his voice , the Fhrer began : " German compatriots : He who wants to have the deepest impression of the decay and resurrection of Germany most vividly must go and see the development of a city like Wilhelmshaven , which today reverberates with life and activity and which till a short time ago was a dead spot nearly without means of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> At that point , the radio audience heard no more from Adolf Hitler . In Germany , where the people are always commanded to drop whatever they are doing and cluster around when the Fhrer makes an important speech , a German springtime song , All the Birds Are Here Again , suddenly came over the air . Many Germans thought that an April Fools ' Day prank was being played . In the U. S. announcers quickly explained that the Fhrer 's speech had been unavoidably cut off . A rumor that the Fhrer had been shot even circulated in Manhattan . <P> Ecstasy . Two-and-a-half hours later a censored recording of the speech was rebroadcast . A polished , edited official version of the text was released from Berlin , while the Fhrer left the mainland to spend the week-end at Helgoland , fortified German island in the North Sea . Nazi officials did not bother to clear up the mystery of the reason for the shutdown . Theory given in London 's Sunday Express was : " Hitler had prepared no speech . He had spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger against Britain for her moves to curb his future planned aggressions . He was described as looking much tenser than usual . Suddenly his entourage realized when he began that , having prepared no speech , he might in a moment of oratorical ecstasy say something which it might not be wise to say . " <P> Peace . Herr Hitler has rarely delivered a worse speech . It was weak , unconvincing , rambling , discursive , formless . Never had Hitler seemed less sure of himself . He worked up no climaxes . He asserted that in seizing Czecho-Slovakia he had performed a " service for peace " and announced that the next Nazi Congress at Nrnberg would be called the " Party Congress of Peace . " His bitterest remarks were directed at Britain : <P> " When today a British statesman Neville Chamberlain demands that every problem which lies in the midst of Germany 's life interest first should be discussed with England , then I , too , could demand just as well that every British problem first is to be discussed with us.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
