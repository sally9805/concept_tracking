This week the No. 1 question in the world was what to do to help the Jews . Irish Catholic Joseph Patrick Kennedy , U. S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , got credit for having activated Neville Chamberlain 's negotiations in Paris which found a partial answer to the question . Nowhere were people more horrified at Adolf Hitler 's pogrom than in Britain . A poll showed that more than seven Britons out of ten , while sympathetic to Chamberlain , considered the Nazi terror a bar to Chamberlain 's " appeasing " relations with the Reich . <P> In Paris Prime Minister Chamberlain and Premier Daladier agreed to open their colonies at once to 10,000 German Jews apiece . In both London and Paris , banking houses were ready to lend to help the Jews get started there , in Ethiopia or elsewhere , and they wanted U. S. bankers to chip in . The U. S. Department of Labor was considering the possibility of hypothecating its German-Austrian immigration quota for the next three years to admit up to 81,000 refugees into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his Matanuska colony of dust-bowl refugees grew , it would open up a frontier where Jewish professional people would be needed and welcome . This was long-range stuff , however , and the Secretary was emphatic on the point that other U. S. territories like the Hawaiian Islands and Puerto Rico were already overpopulated . <P> Pending some sweeping total solution of finding a home for 500,000 persecuted and unwanted German Jews , last week some few shiploads of Jewish refugees continued to arrive in Manhattan , bringing such few Jews as can manage to escape from Naziland under present harsh conditions . Each Jew who came in last week on the S. S. Westernland , for example , was a human story of almost every overtone from courage to despair , or grief to joy . <P> Happiest of the lot was a handsome Viennese youth . Two years ago he began to correspond with then 14-year-old Lillian Wolfram , member of " The Pen Pals , " a Glenside , Pa. , high-school club which encourages boys &; girls of different countries to write to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with the Nazis , Father Wolfram undertook to get him out of the Reich and last week he arrived , a robust 18 to Lillian 's sweet 16 . " I am a Jew and just call me Harry , " he smilingly told ship-newscameramen for whom he readily posed . " I am afraid that , if I told you my family name , harm might come to my mother . " <P> Some other incidents of the week precipitated by the great World Question : <P> &gt;Some of the Irish wanted to help some of the Jews . A committee of Catholics and Jews was formed in Dublin under Frank Fahy , Speaker of the Dail , to make a public appeal for funds to rescue and house 20 families of German and Austrian refugees . <P> &gt;Some Afrikanders were not prepared to be hospitable to Jews . In Johannesburg a meeting of Boers turned into an anti-Jewish demonstration . There were shouts of " Down With the Jews ! " and 30 were injured in a disgraceful exhibition of South African hooliganism . <P> &gt;Commented the Berliner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed by Reader Max Rosenberg , who proposed that " professional killers " be freed from U. S. jails and sent to Germany to assassinate the Fhrer :
