Last week was Winnipeg 's bonspiel . A bonspiel is a curling tournament between clubs . For eight days , wherever you went in Winnipeg , you saw the curlers leaving one rink , on their way to another . Many of them were elderly men , all serious , carrying long brooms and heavy sweaters ; they looked up at the sky , which was tranquil , and said gloomily that it might bring baugh ice , meaning a thaw . <P> On the hard , slick ice of many Canadian cities the curlers use irons , but in Winnipeg , as in Edinburgh and other conservative places they use 35-lb. stones-solid bowls of granite or whinstone , beautifully smooth , with a twist of handle on top . Each side has four players , each player two stones . Players slide the stones at a tee at the end of a 114-ft. rink . One man runs his stone up dead ; his partner lays one to protect him . If a deft opponent may skid between them , knocking both aside , curlers say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Winnipeg bonspiel ; one woman , a Mrs. Snell , got into the men 's bonspiel somehow , but indignant curlers said this would never happen again . This time spectacled old Malcolm Cambell , who has been in every spiel since 1889 , did not win anything . Richard Waugh , Liquor Commissioner , Life Member of the Manitoba Curling Association watched many matches . Howard Wood 's team from the Granite Club won twelve times , was beaten only once , finishing first in the bonspiel and earning the right to represent Manitoba in the world 's curling championship .
