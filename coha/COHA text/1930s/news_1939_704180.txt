Service Planes Steal Show By FRED GRAHAM Special to THE Nsw YORK TIMES . CLEVELAND , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge municipal airport here today a parade of American wings as the nineteenth annual national air races opened . It was not the largest opening-day crowd in the history of the races , but it was an intent gathering . Frank Fuller , set a new record to win the Bendix Trophy race , the meet 's opening contest , and become the only person ever to capture the race twice ; stunt and comedy fliers dipped into their bags of tricks and parachute jumpers supplied thrills , but it was two groups of army and navy fighting planes that stole the show . Since a War Department order has closed all army air fields to visitors , this is the only place in the country offering a vantage point for seeing fighting planes . Fuller 's time for the 2,042 miles from Burbank , Calif. , to Cleveland was 7 hours 14 minutes 19 seconds and his average speed was clocked by the National Aeronautics Association at 282.098 miles an hour . Second in the Bendix race was Arthur C. Bussy of Royersford , Pa. , in a tri-motor Bellanca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 minutes 8 seconds , and his average speed 244.486 miles an hour .

Williams Maycock of Detroit finished sixth , his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weather conditions were ideal for the meet , and before noon several thousands were in the half-mile grandstands . Many carried portable radios tuned to news reports of events in Europe . The public address system used to announce events frequently interrupted running descriptions of the show to give news bulletins from Europe . Commercial Craft Parade One of the most impressive events on the program was a parade of American commercial planes ranging from tiny Piper Cubs , Taylorcraft and Aeroncas through the Stinson Reliants and Stinson 105 's , Beechcraft , Monocoupes , Darts to big Douglas transports . More than fifty commercial and pleasure craft flew around the 1 060-acre airport . Shortly before the Bendix racers started arriving , the famous " Red Rippers " of Squadron Four from the navy 's aircraft carrier Ranger went aloft . There were eighteen planes , pudgy , snarling little single seater Grumman fighters , under the command of Lieut . Comdr. 0 . A. Weller and they had the spectators ' mouths agape with their precision manoeuvres and parade formations . Perhaps the most impressive part of their act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 feet . Coming down over a corner of the stands the stubby silver craft snarled and whined as they leveled off only a hundred feet or so off the ground and started climbing . The crowd seemed awed . Not to be outdone by the navy group , eighteen Curtiss P-36 army pursuit ships from the Twenty-seventh Pursuit Squadron at Selfridge Field next took the air . The corps at West Point never showed more precision and parade ground finesse than the sleek camouflaged fighters as they gassed back and forth before the stands in various evolutions and finally executed an extremely tight Lufberry circle . The prize stunt of the day was performed by Mike Murphy of Kokomo , Ind . Murphy has been a stunt flier for many years but is never content with standard stunts . This year he flies a plane with landing gear on top of the plane as well as in the usual position . He takes off normally and lands upside down , while the crowd does n't know whether to watch or not . Tomorrow the Greve Trophy race will be flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not have so many planes as in recent years . Observers believe it will be fought out between Tony Levier of California and Art Chester , also from California . Fog Halts Miss Cochran BURBANK , Calif. , Sept. 2 ( 2 ) . ? Jacqueline Cochran , winner of last year 's Bendix speed air race , withdrew from the race today , explaining that she thought it unsafe to take off with such a heavily loaded plane in a fog .

A half-hour later they brought it back onto the field . She taxied to the takeoff point , then returned . It was after 8 A. M. , Pacific time , when she made her decision to withdraw . The deadline into Cleveland was 3 P. M. , Pacific time ( 7 P. M. , New York time ) , and she said that to arrive by that time would require an average of 285 miles per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test between here and San Francisco . She announced that she would board a commercial airliner for Cleveland to view the national air races .
