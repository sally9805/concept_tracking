Same day the Polish gold arrived , Paris experts announced they had totted up what they thought was a fair estimate of Soviet Russia 's gold reserve . Before World War I Russia ranked fourth among the gold-producing countries of the world . She has vast deposits in the Ural and Caucasus and in Siberia . But according to the Paris experts , the dust has not been panning out the way it should have . As a " considerable over-estimate , " the Frenchmen thought the Soviet might have in ready gold 21,000,000 ounces ( $760,000,000 ) - only four times as much as the U. S. produces in a single year ; at present less than one-twentieth of the total U. S. reserve . But as European gold reserves go , 21,000,000 ounces is sizable . <P> Last week Russia 's gold reserve was a cause of acute alarm to the British Government . A rumor reached London that Russia had shipped 17 tons of gold to Germany . At first the British Foreign Office was highly skeptical of the rumor , but later , when Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government was aware of the report , Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Richard Austen Butler replied : " Yes , sir , and my noble friend Foreign Secretary Viscount Halifax has reason to believe that this report is not without foundation .
