Sturdily up to the War Ministry in Berlin last week marched a delegation of farmers from East Prussia , " The Hindenburg Country . " They urged embarrassed War Ministry officials to do something about 30 East Prussian pastors in jail or concentration camps . " We want to render every possible service to the Fhrer-in peace time as farmers and in war time as soldiers-but there is one thing that must not be taken from us ! " declared the farmers ' spokesman . " We must be able to serve Our Lord , Jesus Christ , faithfully ! " <P> The War Ministry suggested that the farmers call upon Church Minister Hans Kerrl . At the Church Ministry it was suggested that they try new Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop . But even though the East Prussian farmers were thus shunted around they got action last week . The State , unwilling to have such horny-handed folk go back disgruntled to the Hindenburg Country and grumble , abruptly released most of the East Prussian pastors , none a nationally prominent figure in the Church . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers ' activities in Berlin or even their arrival . The State 's act of clemency and the story of the farmers were then released together last week , timed to blanket in the German press the ending of the Niemoller trial ( TIME , Feb. 21 ) . Heroic Rev. Martin Niemller , a Wartime U-boat commander who helped sink record Allied tonnage , was arraigned four weeks ago on charges which included sedition . During the trial , from which press and public were excluded , the State 's case apparently so far collapsed that all really grave charges against Pastor Niemller were dropped . The State was finally reduced to pressing nothing more than a nuisance charge of " misuse of the pulpit " under a law passed in 1871 under Kaiser Wilhelm I for the purpose of smacking , not too severely , sassy preachers . <P> Under this old law , the court last week sentenced Niemller not to imprisonment in jail but to " honorable detention in a fortress " * for seven months . Showing definite leniency , the court , which might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the sentence imposed while awaiting trial , need only pay a $600 fine to go free last week , so far as the court was concerned . <P> Stepping in the Nazi Secret Police settled Pastor Niemller 's hash by simply flinging him into a concentration camp where he will remain during Adolf Hitler 's pleasure . <P> * Such as Adolf Hitler endured after his Beer Hall Putsch misfired in 1923 . In the Fortress of Landsberg he lived like a fighting cock , occupied his leisure in writing Mein Kampf , the book , which fired all Germany .
