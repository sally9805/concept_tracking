A middle-sized , middle-aged lawyer stood on the rostrum one day last week before the House of Deputies of the sist General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church , continuing its deliberations in Atlantic City . <P> Churchmen and laymen had heard him read a minority report , launch into an impassioned argument . Suddenly , when another delegate interrupted on a point of order , they beheld the lawyer falter . Quick tears came to his eyes . His knuckles grew white clenching the rostrum . While the Deputies hushed , he fought to control himself , finally spoke in a low , choked voice : " I find it impossible to finish what I was going to say . This means so much to me . " <P> Then he left the rostrum . What meant so much to Dr. Joseph Henry Beale , professor at Harvard Law School , was whether his Church should delete " Protestant " from its name . A famed authority on Taxation , Public Utilities , Municipal Corporations and , above all , Conflicts in Law , Dr. Beale is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cambridge lay Deputy to General Convention . Last week he sat on a commission the majority of which believed it " inexpedient " to change the Church 's name . To do so , the majority felt , would alienate Protestants in and out of the Church , create unnecessary difficulties in any future merger with another Protestant denomination . <P> But Dr. Beale was ready to lead a minority truly convinced that the Episcopal Church is no more Protestant than the Church of England or the Eastern Orthodox Church and therefore should not so call itself . When Dr. Beale left the rostrum the House of Deputies broke two precedents . It burst into tumultuous applause , and its president , ZeBarney Thome Phillips , chaplain of the U. S. Senate , announced that Dr. Beale might resume his speech when he felt able , despite a parliamentary rule to the effect that no delegate can speak twice on the same subject . But Dr. Beale spoke no more , explaining later that he had suffered " constriction of the throat . " Said he : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically unable to continue my speech . " For all their respect for Dr. Beale , most of the Deputies did not like his proposal . <P> After wrangling for six hours over theological implications they voted 234-to-207 against changing the Church 's name . Meanwhile a committee of Deputies and Bishops had been deliberating over " national and international " problems as important and significant to the outside world as the change-of-name to Episcopal theologians . Yet whereas the change-of-name excited the Deputies and drove Dr. Beale to tears , the national and international problems elicited only weasel words from the committee , whose conservative majority included onetime Senator George Wharton Pepper , Major General Charles Pelot Summerall and Washington 's Bishop James Edward Freeman .
