txt With at least eighty-six air-starved men still entombed in the sunken British submarine Thetis , the stern of that vessel slipped from the grasp of rescuing ships in Liverpool Bay yesterday afternoon and from then on hope rapidly diminished of saving any more than the four men who yesterday morning floated to the surface from the submerged escape hatch of the ship . At 2 A. M. divers , who in a strong tide were endeavoring to attach pontoon cables with which the Thetis might be floated and dragged to shallower water , reported they heard faint tappings within the submarine . The Admiralty adamantly refused to disclose any of the messages that passed between the imprisoned men and the outside world . The depth at low water was approximately half the length of the submarine , and at most she was not tilted more than 45 degrees after h , er stern had slipped back , though it was understood the bow was deeply embedded in the mud . Up to 2 A. M. the vessel had been submerged for 36 hours 20 minutes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient for 36 hours . Tells of Loss of Hope Shortly after midnight an official of Cammell Laird , builders of the submarine , told relatives of the entombed men that there was no more hope for them . Mrs. G. H. Bolus , wife of the commander of the The ? t is , had spent many hours encouraging wives and relatives of her husband 's men  --  gathered at the Cammell Laird offices at Birkenhead . The Admiralty notified Mrs. Caroline Hole last night that her husband , a stoker aboard the Thetis , was believed to have lost his life while trying to escape . This was the first intimation that any men , other than the four saved , had attempted to leave the Thetis . Captain H. P. K. Oram , Commander of the Fifth Submarine Flotilla , who was the first man out of the Thetis , is said to have described a dramatic conference among the entombed men . It was decided , Captain Oram is reported to have said , that one civilian be paired with a naval man experienced in the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuated , for in the darkness of the escape chamber of the ship it was impossible for an untrained civilian to get out unaided . The provisional theory is that one of the civilians , possibly the one who accompanied Mr. Hole , got jammed in the escape hatch and . thus effectively closed the only avenue of escape to those remaining in the submarine . Salvage Expert at Scene Thomas , salvage expert who raised vessels of the sunken German fleet at Scapa Flow , arrived at the Thetis during the night , and , according to a lifeboat man who had been aboard one of the rescuing ships , an attempt was to be made during the night to drag the Thetis with the aid of pontoons into shallower water . The lifeboat man said it was believed all in the Thetis were dead . Divers failed to connect airpipes , he said , owing to the rush of the tide , and the idea of cutting a hole in the stern was abandoned when it was found the imprisoned men were unable to reach that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to raise the stern high enough to make cutting a hole worth while also failed . For many hours between the tides yesterday eighteen feet of the stern of the submarine were above water ? she was standing almost vertically on her nose in 130 feet of water ? but frantic efforts of the officers and crews of more than twenty Admiralty vessels on the scene failed to get another man out . Before a strong tide around 4 P. M. yesterday washed the subma- rine below the surface , an unsuccessful effort was made to cut a hole through the stern . The wouldbe rescuers had further failures when they attempted to lift the submarine bodily by pontoons or at least to keep the stern above water while a hole for escape was cut . British naval reticence has prevented any authentic statement from reaching the public from the men saved , but it is believed the submarine , which was completing acceptance trials , either struck a submerged wreck during a prolonged dive , damaging and flooding forward compartments , or that there was some failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tug Troon reported that when nearing the scene of the disaster , off Great Orme 's Head , their vessel " scraped over something , " and Captain Alfred Lamey shouted to one of the Admiralty vessels : " We have struck a submerged object . " It was suggested that that obstruction had disabled the Thetis . The four men saved by the Davis escape " lung " are Captain Oram , Lieutenant F. G. Woods , and W. C. Arnold , stoker , both of the Thetis , and F. Shaw , a mechanic employed by Cammell . Laird . Mr. Shaw is said to have told one of his rescuers that two men tried to escape through one of the hatches and were drowned , while " another went mad and died . " " When I left , " he is quoted , " the air was getting worse . The men were sprawled about in the compartments , but there was no panic . It was dark , and in a few more minutes I would have been too weak to escape . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them moving about and talking about sports . There is little hope of the others coming out alive . " Apparently one of the men to whom Mr. Shaw referred was the ' stoker , W. T. Hole , mentioned by the Admiralty in a message to his wife . At 12:35 P. M. yesterday a flotilla of tribal class destroyers , equipped with latest anti-submarine devices , dashed up after an allnight forced-draft drive from Portland . Then it was decided to attempt to cut a hole in the stern . Men with oxyacetylene cylinders and torches were put in rowboats and clambered upon the Thetis 's stern . There flashed blue flame , and sparks cascaded into the brown water of the bay . Anxiously , thousands of men thronging the decks of the surrounding fleet watched these acetylene experts racing against time . They lost ? beaten by the rushing tide . One surging swell caught the Thetis in its grasp , and as the torch-wielders jumped to safety the wave rolled the submarine like a great fish beneath the surface . The tide would not fall again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men , for it was calculated that even in the confined space there would be sufficient air to last them beyond last midnight . Cables were passed under the hull of the sunken craft and attached to huge pontoons , in the hope that the stern could be prevented from sinking deeper . Divers at the Scene But the air supply was the problem . There was no authentic information that divers  --  there were many on the scene  --  had been able to attach air pipes to emergency valves ringed with white circles on the hull . The rescue squads seemed baffled at every turn . There were reports that cables attached to the pontoons snapped under the enormous strain . And then , as the tide receded at 6 P. M. , the stern did not reappear as had been expected . The pontoons had failed to hold it , and the Admiralty sent out a grave message that hope of saving any more lives was diminishing . However , more and heavier pontoons had arrived , and the Warship crews worked desperately to get them to function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling , the destroyer Brazen , which with twenty-one other vessels had maintained a ceaseless all-night search , sighted an object protruding from the water about sixteen miles northwest of Great Orme 's Head . Racing up , the officers saw that it was the stern of the submarine , jutting up almost vertically . Her nose , perhaps shattered by some submerged wreck  --  there are many such relics of the submarine campaign of the World War in Liverpool Bay  --  was buried on the bottom . The water is about 130 feet deep there at high tide . As soon as the tide fell more and more of the submarine 's hull became exposed , until eighteen feet of the tail was out of the water . In a few moments boats manned by the Brazen 's crew were alongside , and officers , tapping messages in Morse code on the submarine 's side , were cheered when a reply from inside told that all the Thetis men were alive . Immediately news was flashed to the Cammell Laird offices at Birkenhead , where , in a large waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were keeping a strained vigil . Many , overcome , burst into tears at the report , which all too soon was taken to mean that safety was at hand . Back over the waters of Liverpool Bay the Brazen was calling for assistance . Just as other vessels were closing around her , the heads of Captain Oram and Lieutenant Woods , encased In their Davis escape apparatus , bobbed above the surface . They had waited until they knew for certain that the Thetis had been located , and then , either by order or through drawing of lots , had made their way through the escape chamber amidships of the submarine to report the position , and assist in the direction of the rescue of their fellows . It was learned afterward that the forward escape chamber had been flooded . A few minutes later , at 9:40 A. M. yesterday , Stoker Arnold , who had been in a similar accident off Malta , in the Mediterranean , when he was imprisoned in a submarine for thirty-six hours , and Mr. Shaw came to the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water for others to appear . ? All four of the rescued men were suffering badly even at that hour ? twenty hours after the diving of the submarine ? from carbon dioxide poisoning , but they told how . all the crew were still alive , though some of the older men were in dire straits . There was a long wait . It was then 10 A. M. yesterday . Something must have gone wrong with the escape chamber . Only those officers exchanging hammer signals with the entombed Men knew what was really amiss . It was announced that many more submarine experts were aboard the Thetis than was at first thought , among them Lieut . Comdr . R. N. Garnett , commanding the sister submarine Taku ; Lieut . Comdr . T. C. C. Lloyd , commander of the sister submarine Trident , and Lieutenant P. E. J. Ryan and Lieutenant Engineer A. G. Jamison , also of the Trident . In addition to the Thetis 's commissioned crew of fifty-eight , there were twenty-six officials and workers from Cammell Laird , three armament experts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Liverpool pilot . Relatives Told of No Hope BIRKENHEAD , England , saturday , June 3 UP ) . ? Sydney Woodward , secretary of Cammell Laird , builders of the submarine Thetis , brokenly told a crowd of the shipyards here early today : " I am sorry , but there is no hope for the ninety men remaining in the submarine . " Women in the crowd of nearly 1,000 wept as he spoke . Many were wives or relatives , and - some had been standing in the shipyards for nearly twenty-four of the thirtyfour hours that had elapsed since the submarine became disabled in diving in Liverpool Bay , which is part of the Irish Sea . The crowd was clustered around the gates of the Cammell Laird shipyard . Hundreds blocked the highway outside the gates of the plant . Four . of those who were in the vessel were saved through use of the Davis " lung " apparatus . Three others were said by a lifeboat crew to have perished in an attempt to follow the four to the surface . The wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the submarine , said today her husband was " dazed " and that after expressing deep concern for the safety of those left aboard he received a sleeping draught and was put to bed . Mr. Shaw was suffering from shock and was under a doctor 's care . He seemed " obviously shaken and somewhat unnerved , " said a naval man who brought him ashore . When he met his wife on the dock he embraced her warmly and talked briefly before being taken home . He praised Stoker W. C. Arnold for assisting him as they rose to the surface by the Davis lung apparatus , Mrs. Shaw said , but he did not give details . Those on shore yesterday could guess fairly accurately why the rescue efforts were failing  --  they could see the tide and the deepening darkness . They were told that the British Navy had no such rescue chamber as had saved thirty-three from the sunken United States submarine Squalus off Portsmouth , N. H. , last week . But no one had any clear-cut idea of ? just what happened Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? of Britain 's rearmament in a warlike world , became disabled in her diving test . All that was permitted to seep from the official wall of secrecy was that the four rescued men had said their companions expected to follow them upward in the escape apparatus . The shipyard was tense when Mr. Woodward , shortly after midnight , made his statement that hope had been given up . A crowd swarmed about him at the timekeeper 's office when he appeared . It was there that many of the civilian workers and technicians who went down in the Thetis had often drawn their weekly pay . " I must announce that the experiment of raising the Thetis 's stern has not been successful , " he began . Then he declared that there was no hope . " The best thing you can do is to disperse and go home quietly , " he concluded . There was a minute or two of silence . Some one yelled : " Where are your experts ? " But he was silenced by those around him .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
