txt To the nation-wide reputation of " Deadwood Dick , " known more prosaically as RICHARD W. CI.ARKE , the contribution made by the dime novel was more valuable than in the case of any other figure of the heroic Wild West . In the glowing imagination of millions of American boys born after the Centennial year 1876. it is primarily Deadwood Dick whose trusty derringer caused so many redskins to bite the dust . He was even more typically a frontier hero in this sense than Buffalo Bill , whose solid place in history was in no need of the services of the novelist . But without him Deadwood Dick would have fallen into the second rank of frontiersmen , Indian fighters , scouts , bad men , whom pious historical research brings back to life for a comparatively narrow public  --  the Jack Crawfords and the Wild Bill Hickoks . To Deadwood Dick fell the broader fame and the higher reality of a non-existent Nick Carter . We are not sure that he does not live in millions of individual memories as a grander hero than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers . That he should have lived into the year 1930 , though dying , to be sure , at the ripe age of 84 , is again a reminder of the extraordinary time perspective of American history beyond the Mississippi . Our Robin Hood in the form of JESSE JAMES lived not eight hundred but only fifty years ago . To go back into the very misty dawn , into the Homeric age of the Great West when covered wagons toiled across the plains and mountains , one must go almost as far back as the year 1842 ! Deadwood Dick was riding the Pony Express route , scouting for the American Army , fighting road agents , and aiding United States marshals to make a show of maintaining order in mining camps and along transcontinental trails , about the time GLADSTONE and DISRAELI were ruling the British Empire , the people of New.York City were fighting Boss TWEED , and the country was almost getting ready for the first Administration of GROVER CLEVELAND . No account of the Far West of this period , says ALLAN NEVINS , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this region exercised upon the older America . " It was a porch opening " upon free wide vistas . It gave " national life a sense of spacious " ness and adventure . " That effect is of course far from spent , but it is usually omitted from the reckoning by impatient critics of the rawness and immaturity of American life today . It is probably a great pity that so many millions of us should be in our literary tastes for the Owen Wister sort of thing , and so few of *us comparatively for the Dostoievsky sort of thing . But good people troubled by the thought that so few American novelists are prepared to write like DOSTOIEVSKY , and so few American workers are ready to organize a British Labor party , may find explanation if not solace in the fact that less than fifty years ago our Western plains were ringing to the bark of the sturdy derringer and the death-yell of crafty Indians engaged in biting the dust .                @ @ @ @ @
