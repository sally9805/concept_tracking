The port of Aden lies on the edge of a huge , volcanic rock on the tilted coast of southwest Arabia about 100 miles from the mouth of the Red Sea . Romans called the neighboring territory Arabia Felix . Kipling , with a sharper eye for the facts , called Aden " a barrick-stove . " It is one of the hottest , most forlorn spots in the British Empire , of which it became a part just a century ago . Its acquisition as Queen Victoria 's first colony made the young virgin Queen very happy . She , the Romans and Aden 's Governor , Lieut. - Colonel Sir Bernard Rawdon Reilly , who says he likes his rock-ribbed home , share their felicity virtually alone . <P> Aden 's rock is so bare that only three clumps of foliage can be seen from the sea . Having not one natural source of drinking water , residents must be satisfied with condensed sea water , with the trickles from artesian wells , one 1,500 feet deep , or with the stagnant liquid in rain-wells which ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonials ' rum-punches are earthy and their cats red-brown from omnipresent dust . Malaria and other tropical diseases are common . Only industries are manufacture of salt and cigarets ( which are sold very cheaply under pirated labels ) . Such sports as camel-racing can be indulged in when it is not too hot . The port , a strategic and impregnable naval base ( sometimes called the Gibraltar of the East ) bristles with guns . <P> In spite of all this , Sir Bernard thinks the Bedouins who live in Aden are lucky . Last week he let them in on some centenary pageantry-a ball , concerts , a show of arms , a special issue of postage stamps . Sixteen sultans from the outlying protectorate paraded in splendor . One real gift , worth waiting a century for in disease-ridden Aden : $30,000 for a Maternity and Child Welfare Centre .
