THE HORSE AND BUGGY DOCTOR- Arthur E. Hertzler-Harper ( $2.75 ) . <P> While publishers jump at almost any book about doctors , seldom have they published them as rapidly as they have the last three doctors ' autobiographies : William N. MacArtney 's Fifty Years a Country Doctor , Chevalier Jackson 's autobiography , Arthur Emanuel Hertzler 's The Horse and Buggy Doctor-the possible beginning of a trend that may yet make the late boom in foreign correspondents ' memoirs look sick . <P> Founder of the 150-bed Halstead , Kans. ( pop . 1,367 ) hospital which he gave away in 1933 to the Sisters of St. Joseph , " Pop " Hertzler , now 68 , is a lanky , Ichabod Cranelike surgeon whom a Civil War veteran described as " the homeliest man I seen since I saw Old Abe . " During his farm boyhood his favorite reading was Dr. Foote 's Family Physician , and Hertzler recalls with satisfaction the time when he walloped a mean teacher with a slate-it pointed to " the ability to act quickly , accurately and energetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hertzler 's three-year course at Northwestern . Later he supplemented his education by correspondence courses and two years ' study in Germany . His quaintest Americana are his adventures in kitchen surgery . Paying sick calls was no cinch . Horse &; buggy covered 20 miles in half a day , while " Pop " shot rabbits and fence posts , read , slept , fought blizzards and dogs that were as bad as the roads . As standard instruments he carried a six-shooter for the dogs , wire cutter , shovel and hammer to cut through fences when he got lost in blizzards . No farmer ever complained . <P> But once in the kitchen , ready to operate , " Pop " was content . While the instruments boiled , he tried to josh the patient into feeling as confident as he did , sometimes had them offering to sharpen his tools . When one kitchen was too small , he set up his plank- &-barrel; operating table under an apple tree . But despite these primitive conditions , says Hertzler , post-operative infections were not more frequent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Hertzler , is not a fancy operating room but thorough knowledge of anatomy and speed . In his own clinic , built with many a headache , he dispensed with masks . According to " Pop , " they only make the operating room look like a harem , give esthetic delight to the modern surgeon who rides to the hospital in a limousine , does nothing more strenuous than change his pants when he gets there . <P> Hankering after the good old days , but grateful for modern medical advancement , Hertzler 's main grievances are against neurotic female patients , most assistant surgeons , meddling parsons , quacks , lawyers ( malpractice suits " are dependent on the presence of a lawyer in a state of malnutrition " ) , believers in mental healing . During a tumor operation , when a patient 's friend stood by repeating " You think you see something , but there is nothing there , " " Pop " held himself in till he finished , then slammed the gory ten-pound tumor on her feet .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
