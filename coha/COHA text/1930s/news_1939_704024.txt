txt Young Bill Faults Merit Rating Condemned in Unemployment System To THE EDITOR OF ' THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am delighted to note that Term TIMES takes an editorial position in opposition to the 17 oung bill providing for merit rating in the unemployment system of our State . As you say , the advantages of merit rating are far from clear . This bill would embody into the law a principle as to whose ultimate desirability there is still great difference of opinion . Organized labor is strongly opposed to it , as are many of the welfare and civic organizations , and in this they are supported by the weight of expert opinion . After a year of study the Advisory Council failed to reach any agreement on the principle , while the legislative committee investigating unemployment insurance agreed that , in view of the complexity of the subject , any immediate action would be unwise . Indeed , it is difficult to know who , except for a small but powerful group of employers , is in favor a the measure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place , it involves the abandonment of one of the principles on which the original law was based . Essentially the amendment aims to adjust taxes so that in any year the sums collected shall merely replenish the fund for benefits paid out . In other words , the effect would be to keep the reserve down to Its status as of Dec. - 31 , 1940 . Premature Action Yet at the time the law was passed it was , urged as a major advantage of this method of providingiagainst unemployment that the imposition of a fixed State-wide tax over a period of years long enough to include both the upward and the downward swings of the trade cycle ? would permit the accumulation of reserves which would be available to meet drains on the fund in bad years . The Young bill , however , would permit all employers to enjoy tax reductions as a result of a year of good employment in the State as a whole , although it would , of course , allow - some employers to benefit more than others . Thus to . peg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 , would be both premature arid arbitrary . Three years of benefit-paying experience form an entirely inadequate basis for determining whether the reserve fund . accumulating on the basis of the present.rate of tax is sufficient to support future drains . In the second place , the proposed merit-rating device automatically insures that any surplus in the reserves should be applied to the reduction of taxes rather than to an increase in the benefits . Only experience a good and bad years can show whether the present benefits are unduly generous or unnecessarily limited . Duration a Factor This is especially important in regard to the duration a the benefits . For if insurance is a system of aid to the unemployed that for social and economic reasons is preferable to others , there are powerful arguments in favor of paying benefits of thie type for more than thirteen weeks . Indeed , current proposals for providing a uniform duration of benefits reduced the maximum period from sixteen to thirteen weeks precisely and only because of uncertainty as to what the fund might be able to stand . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solvency of the fund . For while it is provided that the general level of tax reductions shall be diminished whenever the fund falls below 67 per cent of its 1940 level , the maximum rate that can be collected is fixed at 3.5 per cent . On the other hand , reductions can be made downward in favorable years to the Jew minimum of 1 per cent . Since no large reserve will have been permitted to accumulate . it might take many years to replenish the fund after an unusually bad year , while several years of poor made might very well bring it to insolvency . In the fourth place , the proposal will not even achieve the alleged objectives of merit rating  --  namely , differentiation In tax rates in such a way as to encourage the stabilization of employment . An employer who by careful employment-policies had reduced his benefit wage ratio as low . as 12 per cent would find that the extent of his tax reduction . would be influenced by the general level of unemployment in the - State as a . whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no reduction ' at all , or even be assessed at the increased 3.5 per cent rate . On the other ' hand . in a year of good employment an employer whose experience we somewhat worse than the State average might be entitled to a tax reduction , and to one that was he excess of that permitted the stabilizing employer in a ' less favorable year . Another Shortcoming In the fifth place , because New York has adopted the calendar base year for - the determinatiofl of benefit rights , the benefit wages charged are not those gamed in the current benefit year , but those in the preceding calendar year . Hence the employer actually dismissing a man would not be charged with benefits unless he had paid wages to that man during the preceding calendar year in question . These are but the most Important of the shortcomings of the proposal embodied in the Young bill . It is , however , interesting to note that in a recent study of - various merit-rating - proposals by Professor Herman Feldman and Donald M. Smith , published by Industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheme embodied in the Young bill to a rigorous criticism , conclude that " no experience rating plan built on such insecure foundations could stand up for long . " This judgment is the more significant in that Professor Feldman is one of the few experts who is in favor of merit rating and is a recognized authority on personnel and employment stabilization policies .

Our Technique With Ticks Found Lacking in Finesse To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read in THE NEW YORK Tness about cases of death from the bite of a wood tick .

Birthright Sustained High Court Confirms Women in Their Native Citizenship The importance of Memorial , Day received an added interest this year in the decision of the United States Supreme Court presented by Chief JuStice Charles Evans Hughes , in the case of Frances Perkins , Secretary of Labor , petitioner , against Elizabeth Elg . The question whether one born in the United States is and remains forever a native-born American has been definitely decided in the affirmative , unless such an American ousts himself . or is ousted as a member Of this nation by some positive act . The problem which was presented to the court-caUsed at one time much irritation . A native American woman who was married to a German subject was in an unfortunate position during the World War . Her citizenship followed ? that of her husband . She was subject to the same laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even considered a " friendly alien . " Victory for Women The situation led to many unfortunate conditions . There was nothing that we could do . The alien husband could , of course , enter our armed service and gain many advantages . Some did . When the law was finally changed so that American women could not be deprived a their citizenship , irrespective of the nationality of their husbands , a victory of the greatest importance for womanhood was achieved . Their national equality was accomplished , and husbands were no longer superior to their wives on questions of nationality and citizenship , or , as a matter of fact , on anything else . The influence of native American youth is considerably strengthened by the recent decision . The day may . come when they will be the determining factor . in all matters relating to peace and war . With my mind 's eye . I can see thousands of youngsters , born in the ' United States , now living in foreign countries , parading with the Stars and Stripes in patriotic fervor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may serve other interests , they may . hold public ) office in foreign countries , they may serve in foreign armies , yet they can not change the citizenship of their children , not even in their infancy , unless the children- upon reaching their majority act for themselves . Infants Not Affected The same rule does not apply to the infant children of naturalized parents . because in such a case citizenship follows from the acquired nationality of the parents . If the parents return to their former homes and change their national attachments , their infant children are in the same political pesition as they are . That some foreign governments in their nationalistic drives will scarcely like this most welcome decision is natural . ' Are , too , are becoming nationalistic in the protection of our people . Alien parents can no longer determine the citizenship of their children if born on our shores . " Citizenship is a birthright The melting pot is a-boiling . CHARLES A. OBERWASER .

Tracing Legends Basis of Current Phrases Is Found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Whence arose all the legends , all the so-called current phrases , all the readily understood . allusions , all the rudimentary expressions of philosophical truths ? One would say that as to the legends there is one answer and as to the remainder of the question another . Yet in the last analysis the answer to all is the same  --  past experiences of the human race , handed down by word of mouth through the ages . The housemaid says to the little child : " Do n't run out of the house , or a dragon will come flying through the air and carry you away . " Well , that is what would and did happen to adventurous infants when our distant progenitors lived in caves , and it has come down eight or ten thousand years from housemaid to housemaid as a method of restraining extreme youth . So of all the expressions of concrete philosophy , which we have mostly from the peasants of Europe . Some of the " philosophical truths " are , as they are enunciated , not alone profound but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincingly to an instant appreciation of their value and accuracy . Payment Demanded For example , there was in this city a craftsman who made appropriate gilded frames for oil paintings : justly and properly completing and enforcing upon the mind the effect intended by the - artist . On an occasion , being told of the somewhat unforeseen denouncement of a certain matter , he remarked after a moment 's thought : " Well , you - ca n't ever get " something for nothing without paying for it . " Again , as you will notice , the corelation of the experiences of the ages . Consider the deluge . No sane man believes that it rained for forty days and forty nights until the whole earth was submerged and that then those surplus waters drained off . Where did they go ? Yet there was a " deluge " over a great part of the earth , and it took . a long time to " subside , " and it is upon that fact that the bibliCal legend of " The Deluge " was ' built up , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is a simple one . DroP an object into a pail of water and note-how long it is before the little waves subside . Multiply that ? object by a thousand million , call it a great meteor and drop it into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean . Waves a thousand feet htgle , or more for all I know , will overwhelm the land and will slowly subside and return to their place In the ocean . However , as mere matter of fact , that Is not , wh , at happened . I merely put it , forward as a plausible refuge for , the unlettered or incredulous minds They can understand and believe things as to which some visible evidence still exis. ts The Atlantis Theory What actually happened was that which is conveniently called " a convulsion of nature . " The lost Atlantis sank . Every one knows that a continent did sink in the Atlantic . The mere faets of the existence of the Atlantic Shelf , that the - mouth of the Hudsoia River is a hundred or so miles at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurentian Mountains came up out of the sea  --  to mention a few prominent evidences ? bear silent testimony . Speaking of the Laurentian Mountains , it is interesting to note that at Seven Islands Bay , on the Quebec Labrador where those mountains terminate , people speak a them as marching down into the sea at that point , whereas in truth it is the point where they ceased emerging from the sea . It is also interesting to note that their main structure consists largely of very dark brown petrified sea mud full of minute marine shells . As for the Ark , that doubtless was an Atlantean ship that escaped , being probably on a cruise , perhaps to the Atlantean settlement in the southern part of Egypt . But why go on ? Every legend , all philosophy , each current phrase , is merely something derived from human experiences . CHARLES STEWART Devesorr . New York , June 2 , 1939 .

Marshall , recently named Chief of Staff of the Army , is the only officer not a graduate of West Point who has ever been chosen for Chief . of Staff with the exception of General Leonard Wood . The first three Chiefs of Staff were not West Point graduates  --  Generals S. B. M. YOUng , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as young men performed distinguished service in the Civil War . Major General Wotherspoon was a Chief of Staff who entered the army grom civil life . Therefore , including Generals Wood and Marshall , six of our fifteen Chiefs of Staff were not trained at the United States Military Academy . In attaining the rank of full general , General Marshall will pass over thirty or more brigadier generals and major generals . The Elihu Root bill . creating the general staff in - 1903 was intended to encourage the selection of yOunger generals to head the army . However , as a ruleeseniority has apparently governed the selections of the Chiefs of Staff . The average age of our fifteen Chiefs of Staff is $9 ye.a.rs . Available Officers Older General Marshall , though he was- far down the list when chosen , is 58 . Brig . Gens . Hugh L. Scott and Franklin Bell were the only other Chiefs of Staff taken from the grade of brigadier . General Scott passed over thirteen other generals . He was , however , 61 years old at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was selected and General was 50 . There are at present no young generals available for appointment as Chief of Staff . The twenty major generals of the line in the last available army list average 61 years ; the forty-nine brigadiers ' of the line average 59 . The rear admirals are younger ; they average about 57 years . The navy has , however , a superior system of promotion . All the navies of the world and most of the armies save our own select the officers who are to be advanced to ahigher grade . Our army promoteeethe officers up to the grade of colonel by the routine plan of seniority  --  the man at the head of a list is advanced to the higher grade when a vacancy . occurs . A relatively Very small number of officers are denied promotion when they are found to be professionally or physically unfitted Such men are retired .

Small Interest in Bills Several bills have been introduced in Congress for such an organization of our own defense forces . These bills include provisions for a single and homogeneous air force  --  with its own rules for promotion , pay and retirement , but they have evoked little interest . There is a general idea that if . war comes the President will control the armed services under some added war powers which Congress may grant . This means that , instead of planning for an efficient organization in peace , the matter - will be attempted amid the tremendous confuSion of preparations for war .
