Last week the U. S. people were witnessing and undergoing an experiment in applied Economy . The Congressmen who initiated it having gone home to their guinea pigs , the officials who had to direct it from Washington went sadly but not silently to work . <P> " PWA simply has no funds to administer any program beyond next June 30 , " said Federal Works Administrator John M. Carmody , explaining why he must fire half his staff of 10/417 by January i , wind up all PWA public housing , power and similar projects by the end of fiscal 1940 . <P> Works Projects ' Commissioner Francis C. ( " Pink " ) Harrington , with a reduced appropriation ( $1,477,000,000 ) pared his rolls from 2,200,000 as of last week toward 1,800,000 by mid-September . By September i he must discharge 650,000 ( one in three ) WPAsters who have been on the rolls 18 months or longer . Off " on furlough " must go 56,500 of Ohio 's 166,700 ; 62,200 of Pennsylvania 's 153,000 ; 22,900 of New Jersey 's 67,900 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42,100 ; 400 of smallest Nevada 's 1,600 . About half will be replaced with other applicants . If the record of previously discharged WPAsters holds good , only 15% of the 650,000 will find private jobs ; those who do will average $2.98 per week . The rest must crowd onto overloaded local home relief rolls . <P> In further obedience to Congress , " Pink " Harrington last week : 1 ) warned subordinate officials to shun local , State and national politics , on pain of dismissal ; 2 ) reduced the differences between WPA wages in the South and other regions . He increased the minimum pay for common labor in the South from $19 per month to $31.20 in rural areas , the maximum in cities from $35 to $50.70 , meantime readjusting rates elsewhere to hike the national average from $53 to $55.50 . Even this beneficence had a shock effect on the South where WPA pay already was sufficiently above private pay ( for farm hands , domestics , etc. ) to make labor hard to please . <P> Relief Rolls into Payrolls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a good advertising man would never try to put Business on the spot , said in Rochester : " . . . The New Deal heresies are being swept away ; the threats to Business are one by one being dispelled ; the responsibility now comes directly to industry . Its leaders mast banish unemployment from America . . . put men and women back to work . This is their challenge and their opportunity . . . . " The one sign vouchsafed up to last week 's end indicated that Business will do very little until Congress has done much more . Said National Association of Manufacturers ' President Howard Coonley : " Considerable overemphasis is placed on the claim that Congress ' has accepted industry 's challenge ' and that responsibility for complete recovery has now been shifted to Business . . . . Substantial and sound recovery depends on further positive action by Congress . " . . . But he did add : " I know it is not necessary to urge that all members of the N. A. M. examine carefully their present and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its utmost , within the limitations of permissible volume of production , to translate relief rolls into payrolls. "
