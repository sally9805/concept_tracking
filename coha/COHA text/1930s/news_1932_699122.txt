txt Based on the belief that James J. Walker will not be nominated , and that the courts will rule that a Mayoralty election must be held this Fall , several informal booms for the Democratic nomination were started in the last week . This was In the face of indications from party leaders that no decision was contemplated , in any event , prior to the State convention , which begins on Oct. 3 . A decision by the Court of Appeals on the question whether an election will be held is expected shortly after that time if the case is rushed . The first court decision will be handed down by Supreme Court Justice John E. this week . Berry Boom in the Open . A campaign for Controller Berry , being carried on with his consent , came out in the open yesterday , with an announcement that a , committee of veterans , high in the councils of the American Legion , have written to four of the five county leaders in the city , asking for an audience for the committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be urged . The only leader of whom an audience was not requested was Edward J. Flynn , leader of the Bronx , of which Mayor Joseph V. is a resident . A boom was started also for former Mayor John F. Hylan . Justice Hylan , during whose administration the Bronx Terminal Market was built , issued a statement yesterday sharply criticizing Mayor for his order closing the market on Jan. 1 . He called the step " political deceit at its highest degree " and added that " what the Mayor is doing is clearly nothing more than an unintelligent effort to win the approval of a public which is in a large part not fully informed on the real situation underlying this market problem . " The names of several Brooklyn Democrats , all perennials as Mayoralty possibilities , have also been mentioned , as well as that of Surrogate James A. Foley , the latter having been suggested as a candidate of the Ahearn faction in Tammany. Record Held Best Aid . Friends of Mayor have pointed to his activities at City Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time they back the contention of the Mayor 's legal advisers that under the law no election can be held this Fall . The Mayor has refrained from enlarging on his statement of last week that he is " an organization Democrat . " It was pointed out , however , that there is nothing in the code of an organization man that prevents him from making a fight for preferment within the organization itself . While Mayor has evinced no intention of undertaking a general cleaning out of his predecessor 's Cabinet until he knows whether his term as Mayor expires Jan. 1 or a year from then , the term of Dr. William Schroeder Jr , as chairman of the Sanitary Commission may be brought to a close this week . The Mayor has called on him for an explanation of the department 's handling of incinerator bids and construction , and if a suitable ex- planation is not forthcoming observers at City Hall have foreseen Dr. Schroeder 's resignation or removal . His term is fixed by the law which set up the commission and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he can be removed on charges after he has had ten days to answer . The Veterans ' Statement . The announcement of the veterans ' committee for Mr. Berry ? was signed by James H. Johnson , past commander of the American Legion in Kings County , in the form of a letter to the four county leaders . The letter follows : Since the resignation of Mayor Walker a number of men have been mentioned for the nomination as his successor . None is better qualified than the man who now for seven years has served the people as Controller of their city ? Honorable Charles W. Berry . His record is unblemished despite the number of intricate problems presented to him during this time and he has earned the - respect of the voters . Seven years as a member of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment has qualified him to become the chairman of that board . Seven years as the fiscal officer of the city has taught him the principles of economy which for years he tried to pass on for the information of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanchest proponent of economy in government and that is what the people are clamoring for today . That is the opinion of those who are actiya In veterans ' organize ; tions , and a delegation hereby requests that you receive them within the next few days so that they can personally urge upon you the selection of Controller Charles W. Berry as the Democratic nominee for Mayor . Those listed as members of the delegation were as follows : JAMES H. JOHNSON , Past Commander American Legion .

YOUNG , Past Commander Fraternity Post ; Past Vice County Commander Kings County American Legion . nylon 's Views on Market . Justice Hylan , in his statement on the Bronx Market , said that " no one will attempt to deny that the market has not been a success , " and added : " In fact it has been a public liability . But this is not the fault of the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll with non-producers and political parasites who could n't run a pushcart , much less a huge market , and because no one higher up M the city government has had the brains or initiative to make it function properly , this does not mean that the market itself is a failure . " He declared that while Mayor had been quick to discharge Markets Commissioner Dwyer for failing to prepare a plan to make the market self-sustaining. he had not been so quick to announce the appointment of a commissioner who could and would operate the market satisfactorily . The move , in addition , Mr. Hylan said . " presupposes Mr. will still be Mayor . " " Leaving myself entirely out of the picture , it is altogether possible that Mr. will not be Mayor on Jan. 1 , " he declared . " Mayor should know that during this coming Winter we will see a wide demand for cheap foOdstuffs , particularly among ' the unemployed and those depending upon charity . All over the country foodstuffs which could be used this Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the ground . " The Bronx Terminal Market could hold tons and tons of this stuff . Why not , then , facing the certain food emergency which will exist this Winter , fill the place with food now going to waste for the lack of even a cheap purchasing price , in order to insure that the men , women and children who will be crying for something to eat can have it without paying the higher prices of the Winter market . " This suggestion , I realize , is not in keeping with the Terminal Market idea , and I do not endorse it as a permanent plan . But it is far more practical and desirable than the Mayor 's plan of waiting until Winter is here before getting into action . When Winter is here it will be too late to save the foodstuffs rotting now . " Justice Hylan offered to contribute $1.000 to " any non-profit pool which will be organized to buy up food now going to waste and store it in the Bronx market for Winter distribution . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to do likewise . Mayor declined last night to comment on Justice Hylan 's state-ment ,
