Overseer of the Poor in Hoboken for 42 of his 74 years was bluff , beefy Harry L. Barck . He thought during Depression that the State let the " Relief trust " turn public charity into a racket . Two years ago , when New Jersey turned administration of relief over to its municipalities , he proceeded to act on this belief by cutting Hoboken 's Relief rolls from 7,000 clients to 360 . Tales were borne to the State capital at Trenton about Mr. Barck bawling out applicants , refusing to buy milk for families with small children . Poormaster Barck 's friends retorted that he was weeding out " chiselers , " had cut Hoboken 's Relief expenditures to $6,000 a month . <P> One day last week Poormaster Barck was interviewing applicants in his office . He had been attacked so often that Patrolman Louis Carmody stood on guard outside his door . The officer had just been asked to arrest Mrs. Lena Fusco for spitting in Mr. Barck 's face when into the office shuffled small Joseph Scutellaro , 36 , an unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two babies since he applied for Relief in December . <P> Soon from behind the closed office door came angry voices , Harry Barck 's shout : " That 's all there is to it . Next ! " But the door did not open . When an assistant and Patrolman Carmody opened it , they found Harry Barck clutching his chest , his last client standing white-faced near the wall . Ironical was the fact that during the interview a postman had delivered an $8 relief check at Joseph Scutellaro 's house , more ironical , the weapon with which Joseph Scutellaro , by his own confession , had dealt a mortal wound : the long spike on which Poormaster Barck stuck rejected applications .
