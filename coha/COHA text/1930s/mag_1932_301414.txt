On the recital program which Pianist Jos Iturbi played in Manhattan last week a composer with the prosaic name of Bennett kept company with Haydn , Schumann , Chopin , Brahms , Liszt . Haydn and Schumann provided meaty sonatas for impish Iturbi to play in his neat , polished style . Chopin and Brahms showed him expertly romantic . Liszt exercised his strong , fleet fingers . But none of these great ones overshadowed the man named Bennett . He contributed four miniature studies , descriptions of sights he had seen in Paris . They were so vivid and neatly wrought that listeners could fairly see the children Bennett had seen playing behind Notre-Dame , the glimpse of Montmartre 's tinseled night life , the noisy Place d ' Italic with its reek of garlic , the tomb of the Unknown Soldier which through Bennett 's eyes seemed more futile than impressive . <P> When he had finished playing the studies and a less effective fox trot , Iturbi pointed out a tall blond man with a foxlike face sitting in a box . Robert Russell Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he stopped playing every instrument in a boys ' band in Freeman , Mo. , faced an audience . In Manhattan for 13 years Russell Bennett has practised his trade behind scenes . He works for Harms , the music-publishers . When a songwriter like Jerome Kern or George Gershwin wants to put on a show he takes his tunes to Harms for Russell Bennett to orchestrate . <P> Bennett 's clients are aware that his smart variations , his rich counterpoint , will do wonders for the simplest song , but until lately none of them bothered to put his name on the program . They changed their ways when serious musicians started praising his talent . The fact that Bennett can sit down at a drawing board , turn out 80 pages of orchestration a day while his wife reads to him or plays the radio , will seem less significant to laymen than a list of the current shows he has had a hand in . He prepared most of the scores for Music in the Air , Of Thee I Sing , Flying Colors , Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch to George Gershwin 's Pardon My English which opened last week in Philadelphia ; to Walk a Little Faster in which Beatrice Lillie opened this week ; to Sissy , Fritz Kreisler 's operetta opening this month in Vienna . Bennett 's jobs are piled high ahead . He is collaborating with Critic Robert A. Simon of The New Yorker on an opera . Philip Barry is having him write a musical background for a new play . Kreisler and Iturbi have commissioned him to write them concertos.
