T HE average man will tell you that all this money and big borrowing stuff confuses him . And well it might . But is the subject really as complex as it appears to be ? And how much of the confusion arises out of the subject itself ? And how much from loading it with a new system of mathematics and a new system of morals ? Can it be that all the wise talk about gold , silver , greenbacks , revaluation , stabilization and budgets is only so much patter by which a. few men in places of leadership have charmed themselves into thinking they are solving a money problem when actually they are creating one ? For at least three thousand years , and possibly for longer , politicians have been periodically appearing with formulas for magic money . Always they appear during a period of disaster and always they disappear leaving more poverty in their wake . What are the chances that the financial measures undertaken in the name of recovery are only curtain raisers for speculation in which debts will pile upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us in 1920-21 , and the remains of the war debts plus other debts of the bright new era. did just that to us in 1929 . We recovered with difficulty from 1920-21 . We have not recovered from 1929 . Twice since the war we have involuntarily handed over the country to the speculators . Are we now about to do likewise ? And what are the chances that the manipulation of the value of the dollar will serve only to present our foreign debtors with seven or eight billion dollars due to our nation and its citizens ? And what are the chances that , going farther , the invested savings of the American people  --  amounting to about thirty billions  --  will be cut to half ? The Diluted Dollar rpHIS money plan involves no change in the out- ward appearance or the names of our money . The new dollars will still be called dollars . But we are all to pretend that gold has so increased in value that our dollars have been buying too much and it would serve prosperity to have them buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he easier to pay debts . At the moment , the debtors call more loudly for attention than do the creditors . In 1920 the creditors had the door ; they said that they were being defrauded by high prices . To the end of decreasing the buying power of the dollar  --  raising prices  --  the Government is taking all the gold of the country into its own custody and arranging for a diluted or rectified dollar , related to gold in a **25;547;TOOLONG way . At the moment of writing , the value for the time being has been set at 59.06 cents . By changing the standard of gold in the dollar , one old gold dollar tossed into the air comes down as two , so the Treasury is entitled to mark up its gold by 100 per cent . This gives a big surplus and the Secretary of the Treasury is expected to manage two billions of this surplus in a blind , speculative pool so as to keep down the price of the dollar and to keep up the price of Government securities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old one abroad . Nearly every nation since the war has had a try at running a pool in its money instead of trying to balance its trade , and to date all have been admitted failures except Great Britain 's , which is the largest . Opinion in London is divided as to whether it is a success or a failure . While the Secretary of the Treasury speculates in the value of the dollar , he is also required to borrow ten billion dollars by June in order to finance various governmental agencies designed to promote prosperity . The pace of borrowing is higher than even that of wartime . IL is not expected that any such sum can come out of the savings of the people , so the Government really will not borrow at all , but will simply manufacture with its left hand through the machinery of bank credit the funds which it will disburse with its right hand . The Government will spend this money in ways which may or may not add to the national wealth . The one certain point is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal debt soared during the war years from under two billions to a peak of twenty-six and a half billions in 1919 . It was reduced to sixteen billions in 1930 . The new debt will rise to around thirty billions . This debt will remain a charge upon the daily earnings of those who do the work of the nation until it is paid off or defaulted . A national debt , like a private debt , can he paid off only by producing goods . It is so much easier for politicians to create debts than it is for farmers and factory workers to produce goods , that our Civil War debt is the only example of a great debt honestly paid off by work . If we can pay off the debt we are now incurring by rapidly increasing our actual wealth and not merely by changing the price tags on our wealth , we shall emerge a stronger and wealthier nation than ever . But if we follow the thought so strangely current that the way to have more is to produce less and sell it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirl of speculation , only to be east out poorer than yet we have been . Let us therefore inquire . For then we may perhaps avoid , some time hence , being compelled to echo the words of that French statesman who , calling his colleagues together , began by saying : " Gentlemen , we have foreseen everything but what has happened . " .12 Sure Way to Get the Debtor Vote HE devaluation  --  which up to now has always 1 been called the debasement  --  of coinage is one of the most ancient of political devices and has mostly been used by rulers to stay in office after the money runs out and there is no way of getting any more . The old method was for a ruler to call in the coins and remint them under the same names , but at lesser weights  --  retaining the difference or , as it is now called , the profit .. During the more turbulent days of Greece and Rome , at least one candidate was always seeking the votes of debtors by offering to provide cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience , democracies learned that the political power to control the value of money could be made the most tyrannical of all powers , and the age-old struggle has been to keep the control of money away from the politicians . The operation of devaluation is very easy to understand . Suppose I buy a cow , promising to pay for it a thousand pounds of sugar on a certain date . Suppose I am in a position of authority and can determine the weights and measures . Suppose , at the time of making my contract to pay , a pound was a definite accepted weight . But suppose , after making my contract , I decree that the weight denoted by an ounce shall be exactly one-half of what it was before . Thereupon I pay my creditor a thousand pounds of sugar under the new definition of an ounce . He will get only half as much sugar as , at the time of making the contract , he thought he was going to got , and his only recourse will be to pretend that one spoonful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if I again try to buy a cow from him , the price will be two thousand pounds of sugar plus whatever he can tack on to make up for the sugar he was officially cheated of . Substituting gold for sugar does not change what happens , but merely brings in more language . What Devaluation Does IF THE man who was short-changed on sugar hap- pened to be owed more than he owed , he would probably start a campaign to displace the ruler who changed the weights . But if he owed more than was owed to him , he would be all for the new ounce , or even for a lighter one , so as easily to get rid of his creditors . So , no matter what else changing the weight of an ounce or a dollar may do , it immediately throws the standard of measurement into politics , and the astute ruler who wants to stay in office must each day count noses to discover whether he will favor debtors or creditors . In the meantime , since neither buyers nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gamble . At its best , devaluation is a method by which an insolvent nation settles with its creditors . At its worst , it is a method by which a solvent nation defrauds its creditors . The United States has the distinction of being not only the first solvent creditor nation deliberately to debase its coinage but also the first to do so with no knowledge that any class of its own citizens can be benefited , with the fairly certain dollar-devaluation plan are correct , discover that though he still has five hundred dollars , prices have so increased that he has only the equivalent of two hundred and fifty dollars in buying power . If the theories are incorrect , the only beneficiaries will be our foreign debtors . This requires some explanation , for so much is being said about . gold that it is getting out of focus . As a matter of fact , gold , as gold , does not directly enter this question . We have to exchange goods for goods . If we trade goods for promises to pay  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what form it may take  --  and the promises to pay are not kept , we involuntarily give away our goods . A promise to pay in the future is only keeping the ball in the air until such time as the debtor can get . goods . It is convenient to use money in these trade transactions , and the money must have a standard of value , for not otherwise would we have anything in which to express prices . A dollar might be the right to call for six eggs , and we could get along very well with such a dollar unless during the midst of our trading someone decreed that a dollar should be only three eggs . It is of no importance whatsoever in domestic transactions to have a dollar which is intrinsically worth the amount stamped on it , for in our everyday lives we want money not for itself but for the things that it will buy . Carrying around a weight of gold or silver to make purchases would be only a degree less inconvenient than carrying around sacks of flour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently been through the experience of having their coinage debased who view paper money or new promises . If a nation can not pay in gold and the creditors refuse to take any new promises , the nation is bankrupt . But , since there is no court in which a nation can be adjudged bankrupt , the nation goes off the gold standard . This merely means that it repudiates the payment of its debts in gold . All the nations during the war borrowed far beyond their ability ever to repay . After the war they continued to borrow more than they could repay , and so they have repudiated their debts . The palaver about an international money agreement is really about nothing at all . If a nation buys or borrows more than it can repay by selling , no money method exists to make up the difference . If it adjusts its outgo to its income , its international credits and debits will balance and make unnecessary the transfer of any money . The international gold standard has not broken down . It is the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor any other standard holds the only secret which is today desired  --  that is , a way continually to live beyond one 's income and still stay solvent . America 's Adventure in Foreign Finance - I L.:VERY nation , with the exception of the United States , that is today off the gold standard is bank-rupt in the sense that it can not pay its obligations either in gold or in goods . Britain chose to sacrifice her holders of foreign long-term investments to the needs of her short-term debtors and is now trying to find a balance between them . The learned talk about knowledge that its worthiest citizens may be harmed and the certain knowledge that the only immediate beneficiaries will be the foreign nations and individuals who owe money to the United States or its citizens . The only certain consequence to date of the Administration 's action in going off the gold standard is a gift to foreign debtors . That may turn out to be the only consequence of the whole maneuver . If , however , it is true that domestic prices can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of every life-insurance policy , every savings-fund deposit and every building-society share would be cut to half . These are not the investments of the rich but the savings of the provident backbone of the country . A man who has saved five hundred dollars will , if the theories of those behind the bank checks with suspicion . Our own people began to hoard hard money only when they began to doubt the banking system . The gold reserves that used to be behind our paper money , although in theory for the purpose of paying gold on demand , were in practice restrictions on the amount of money that could be issued ; and when the commercial banks closed , the Federal Reserve banks still had the gold power to issue several more billions of paper money . It is in international affairs that gold counts . Trade between countries represents an exchange of goods , and if a nation buys more than it sells , it must pay the difference in gold or in promises to pay . If , when the promises become due , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid in gold or in stabilization has nothing at all to do with stabilization , but concerns the discount at which a settlement may be made with creditors . The United States does not owe vast sums abroad which it must compromise . It is owed vast sums . It is the foreign debtors who have reaped the harvest . The tragedy or comedy of America 's great adventure in foreign finance , which was probably the largest single factor in bringing on the depression , has thus entered a new phase . The action of the Administration in going off the gold standard and its repudiation of the obligation to pay the bonds of the United States in gold , rubbed off the veneer of morality in international transactions .

The bonds , however , sold to American private investors during the period when our astute international bankers were making New York the gold-brick venter of the world , are in a different ease . These are obligations issued by various foreign states , by their political subdivisions and by private corporations . None of them is held exclusively by American citizens and some are held locally , so that a default may mean a creditor on the doorstep . Of the more " You 're crazy , Oppy ! " Jerry was shouting .

Some of the issues in default are selling very low in paper dollars in New York , and any foreigner with gold exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front 35 per cent upward , depending on the price of the dollar . There is a good deal of quiet buying of many of these issues by foreign speculators who are willing to take the chance that some day they may get something for them . But the big , systematic dealings are in German bonds and , in a world without financial morals , the maneuvers of Germany are impressive . Put beside the German scheme , all the other flimflams of the nations are hopelessly crude . The Germans not only are playing both ends against the middle but are doing it in broad daylight . They are keeping up their payments on their Dawes Plan mid Young Plan bonds in order to avoid any trouble with France until they are ready for it . They are keeping up their payments on bonds held in Holland and Switzerland for trade reasons , and also because the bankers of those countries are exceedingly good at . collecting . Beyond that they refuse to go . The German financiers and politicians have only one interest  --  Germany . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have had one trip through social justice and inflation , and do not desire another . They are capitalizing their bankruptcy . Because excessive payments overseas would inevitably have broken down their home currency , a great mass of their current foreign indebtedness was held up in what are known as " blocked marks " - which are good in Germany but nowhere else . Current foreign creditors can have this money  --  to spend in Germany . Double-Duty Marks These blocked marks serve another very useful purpose . Many  --  perhaps most  --  of the 130 issues of German bonds sold in this country are in default . Those not in default are being made to do double duty under a plan devised by Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , the head of the Reiehsbank and a well-known figure in this country . At first he permitted the interest on these bonds to be paid 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in a scrip which is redeemable only at the Gold Discount Bank in Berlin , and at whatever figure the bank chooses to offer . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 per cent and the scrip has been increased to 70 per cent . An American can sell his scrip to the Discount Bank at 50 per cent of its face , and , under a new agreement , he may get 67 per cent . This scrip is then sold to German exporters , who can exchange it for blocked marks at 100 per cent . This works gut to give the German exporter about a 40 per cent advantage in his home costs in goods sold in foreign trade  --  which is an advantage sufficient for him to overcome any tariff anywhere . The foreign creditors of Germany are helping in a big way to finance the German export trade . This , however , is not all . The German exports to this country are of course sold here for dollars . These sales create dollar bank balances , and the balances are being used to buy up German bonds . Of the more than a billion German dollar bonds floated here at or around par , the Germans have already bought and sent back to their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , on a day when the paper dollar was quoted at 64.5 cents in gold , Berlin 6.1. s were quoted at 35 in New York in paper dollars . That price , however , meant only 22.6 in gold  --  the price to the Germans . Taking a long list of German bonds on that same day , the price to the Germans for their bonds , thanks to America going off the gold standard , ranged from 11 to 49.6 , with most of the issues under 30 . The profits to the Germans do not end here , for , though what has already been explained is complex enough to bewilder most people , there are further discounts , according to the kind of German money used , various conversion schemes in Germany and other intricacies so baffling that only an expert mathematician standing on his head can get at the facts . We do know , however , that the Germans have spent more in buying back their bonds than they would have had to spend had they paid the interest on them . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their debts . Of course squads of American financiers and their lawyers have gone abroad to adjust the situation , but . all they have got to date has been headaches and trivial concessions ; and the Germans , without even cracking a smile , go on with the game . The question now is what will become of the two-billion-dollar stabilization fund with which the American Treasury would like to enter this grand international financial game . Perhaps there just isn't. any such question . The opposition from abroad to America putting two billions more of gold on the table seems somewhat . perfunctory . Those foreigners may see a Santa Claus behind the big , bad wolf . Speculating in the price of money is the most vicious of all known forms of speculation , for it saps the very lifeblood of the country . There is no way of overemphasizing that statement . A slow and solid rise in stock prices is usually a sign of better general business , but for some reason every present. , quick movement upward in stock prices is touted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to the fact that stock and commodity prices today are moved upward or downward by the Administration 's gold policy . The Administration can put stock prices up or down at any moment it chooses , and the power and authority to do this are to be continued by the stabilization fund in the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury . A changing money value is good for speculation , for it provides a continuing series of events to promote gambling . But it is bad for business , for it makes gambling on future prices the principal part of business . Watching a ticker tape is much less trouble than managing a factory , so the tendency is to cut out the factory . This was very evident in 1919-20 . Every man one met talked about the marvelous skill he had used in buying and the profit he already had in his inventory . The tune changed before 1920 was half over . The Creation of Fiat Credit All this is of vital importance , in view of the almost immediate Government borrowing of the ten billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four billions represent refunding and six billions will be new money . If there were any great accumulated savings , the taking up of the Government loans would only Involve a shifting of bank accounts . There would also be no change if the holders of corporate stocks and bonds decided to sell and reinvest in Government bonds . That would only mean a heavy decline in the price of corporate securities . But all the uninvested savings of individuals as represented by the life-insurance companies , the savings funds and so forth would scarcely absorb a billion of these bonds . The bonds will have to be taken by the banks , and this is simply a bookkeeping operation creating fiat credit which may or may not have exactly the same effect as fiat money . When a bank buys bonds directly from the Government , it merely opens on its books a deposit to the credit ? of the Government . This deposit requires no reserve , for it is secured by collateral deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank . In the course of time the Government . calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations , and this money turns up in the banks as commercial deposits . According to law , a reserve averaging 10 per cent . EVENING POST must be kept in the Federal Reserve Banks against individual deposits . Already the member banks have reserves of more than eight hundred million dollars over and above their requirements . Since a dollar in reserve permits a hank to create by lending about ten dollars in credit deposits , the banks already have the capacity to extend about eight billions in credit , or two billions more than the Government will immediately require . The banks have right along bad the capacity to lend all the money that business might . need , but they have been chary of lending because so many of them have needed every dollar they could get to set their own houses in order and at the same time to have enough on hand for bank runs . Business has not been greatly hampered , in spite of all the cries to the contrary , for most sound concerns have had ample resources to swing the very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the Government borrowing will be to increase the deposits of the banks . Those enthusiasts who reason that because money is always plentiful in prosperity it follows that providing easy money will bring prosperity , neglect the fact that in prosperity money is plentiful because trade is flowing . It is then easy to borrow because events make it easy to repay . If the result of the Government spending is to start up business , private enterprise will borrow the idle deposits in the banks to use for productive purposes , and if production should really get under way we should not have to bother much about the loans . With the value of the dollar being shifted by administrative edict , will the kind of man who can be trusted with borrowed money care to borrow ? If he thinks that he can take care of the price shifts of money manipulation , will he also think it worth while to venture against the chance that the management of his business will be taken away from him ? The threats of higher wages , shorter hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington are all threats to interfere with the private management of industry . Many banks have sold preferred stock to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , and there is evidence of a desire to nationalize banking , in effect if not in name , as a long step toward state Socialism . How many men are going to throw themselves into earning money without the certain knowledge of being able to keep the money they earn ? There is one place , however , where any individual with money and a natural instinct to make more can turn . He can go to the stock exchanges , for there he can make or lose money under his own eyes and under his own control . And there , too , he can get bank credit , for a bank which is afraid to tie up its funds for three or six months and yet needs earnings to pay expenses can conservatively lend at call on stocks and commodities , with the certainty of being able to get back its money at once . If the chances of profit from specula-tion outweigh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the center of the stage . In the past , when the banks were full of money , speculation has always offered more attraction than business . This , of course , is not universally true as to all but one only has to recall March 10. " 34 1928-29 to realize how many othervii$13 sensible people thought they could make their livings by speculating- If that was true when there were no governmental obstacles to business , is it any less true today when the Government has at least a finger in nearly everything ? It would seem that the set-up is absolutely ideal for specula .. This speculation will raise prices , and those who believe that the salvation of the country depends upon raising prices will cheer . But what prices will be raised ? Shall we have a kindly reflation and a controlled expansion in orderly fashion ? Prices raised by speculation are disorderly prices . At first stocks and commodities go up , then the speculation gets into the necessities of life , and one hears tales of shortages . Everyone remembers the sugar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk in the country than ever before . The cost of things that one must buy rises much faster than earnings . This brings on strikes among wage earners and very hard times for white-collar people . The overall parades of 1920 were white-collar protests against speculation . But how about a controlled price rise ? A lot of fluent language is being spoken on that point . - There is considerable machinery for the control of credit expansion or credit inflation . But none of it at the moment happens to be in order . The Federal Reserve Banks can to some extent control credit by raising the rediscount rate and also by open-market operations . These operations are not mysterious . If the Federal Reserve Banks buy securities on the market , principally Government obligations , they inject money into the market , while if they sell they take money out of the market . The Secretary of the Treasury is also authorized to use his two-billiondollar stabilization fund in the same manner . Under the banking act , the Federal Reserve authorities may withdraw the privilege of rediscounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in the speculative market . When Control and Speculation Meet This machinery of control , which might have some effect under normal conditions , would , under the conditions that must obtain , be of no avail . If a speculative fever gets under way  --  and the price-raising enthusiasts insist that it must get . under way  --  the necessity for control will not be admitted until the speculation is out of hand . And then the exercise of control will bring a smash . We will not lock the door until the horse is stolen . That is inevitable . If the Federal Reserve Banks take measures to restrict credit by making it dearer , they will run head-on into the program of the Administration not only for raising prices but also for floating bonds . It was the desire of the Federal Reserve authorities to restrict credit in 19/8 in order to avoid a speculative orgy . But the Treasury had to float a big loan , and so they were overruled . Thus we had the orgies of 1919 and the inevitable crash . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1928 , hut . they wore overruled , and so we had the crash of 1929 . With the Administration policy of raising prices and with the great speculative forces that will appear when things start booming , it is asking more than can be demanded from any set of Truman beings to apply the brakes in time  --  and more especially if an election is coming on . The man is yet to be born who will check what the crowd thinks is prosperity . There is no point in being either optimistic or pessimistic  --  in hanging garlands or hanging crape . No one soberly asks for a riot of speculation except the few who know how to make the most of speculation . No one desires to have wealth redistributed in any such way that it will be taken from the thrifty and given to the speculators , with the poor staying exactly where they are now . No one desires to deepen ! he depression . But our course is headed directly into a speculation which must . be followed by a deepening of the depression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that we are slowly recovering . Is it not the counsel of plain horse sense to take what is good and to avoid what is had ? If the country restricts its production while increasing the amount of its money , speculation in things made is inevitable  --  for there will be snore money than things . A sudden raising of wages and shortening of hours will restrict production unless accompanied know she often gabbled on purpose  --  when the lines were n't important  --  the pace of the play was her chief concern and if the house did n't get every word of " Wo n't you sit down ? " it did n't matter . But when there was a crucial situation or a brilliant line to handle , you could n't miss it  --  it knocked you way bark on your heels just the way she intended . That was acting  --  the kind of conscious skill that Jefferson had  --  and also dear May Irwin  --  the absolute , knowing efficiency of consummate art .

When there was a job to do , she could n't rest . When she was n't working , she turned recluse and relaxed utterly . After the Red Cross tour was over , Laurette Taylor 's book about it stressed the fact that she 'd never met . Mrs. Fiske , although they 'd been in the same troupe for three weeks , which gives you an idea of how she kept to herself . You never knew how to reach her .

Conserving her energy was part of her job , since she used it so lavishly when she was working , and she went about it in her own calm , absolutely efficient way . With Mrs. Fiske and Arliss standing hy , we wore back in the running with a vengeance . And then I startled myself by discovering a couple of major by lower costs  --  and lower costs are not to be had overnight . Higher costs mean higher prices and a narrowing of markets . Lower costs mean lower prices and a widening of markets . Eventually they mean higher wages and shorter hours . thence more regulation of business to the worthy end of providing employment . will tend only to decrease employment . It is the fashion to danin all bankers because some leading men were unfaithful to their trust . But no amount of damning will alter the fact that our banks are expected to do the impossible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money of depositors and also to have it all on hand whenever the demand arises . The obvious banking reform is not more regulation but a dividing of banks into classes , so that a bank taking demand deposits can always , through the Federal Reserve Banks , have the means of becoming instantly 1 iq aid without selling out borrowers , while other classes of banks , taking only time deposits , can go into the longer forms of investment . Titus , though we might not prevent booms , we could avoid the too-quick liquid ? , tion which brings on panics and depressions. playwrights  --  or rather having them drop into my lap  --  two more of those brilliant youngsters that kept cropping up those times . Actors had always been my long suit , but I had never raised playwrights from pups before . It was well worth doing and very little trouble , because these playwrights were George Kaufman and Marc Connelly . ? Kaufman first swam into my ken when he was dramatic reporter on the New York Times and came in looking fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great shine to . We had a play called Someone in the I louse that was n't shaping up right and Lynn Fontanne under contract , doing nothing  --  so I suggested to this bright young fellow that he might write a part for her into this play . That struck him as a fine idea and he dial  --  a part based on F ' . P. A. 's Dulcy character that made a big hit for Lynn  --  so big a hit , in fact , that I asked Kaufman to do her a whole play round this character , arranging with F. P. A. , of course . lie was tickled pink  --  but he wanted a collaborator , he said  --  a young fellow named Connelly from his home town , which was FiGskurgh , who was at loose ends and could write dialogue . With my usual wt'ong-headedness , I held out for an experienced collaborator , if any , but Connelly was finally called in . The result was brilliant  --  even I could see that  --  but its apparent lack of plot worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indianapolis . But Tarkington was there , and after the first . performance he cornered me for a word to the wise  --  which was to give these boys their heads and let ' em write what they pleased just as they pleased . They did n't need plot , he said  --  all they needed was a typewriter apiece and full steam ahead . That sold me . The roaring applause the first night in Chicago sold inc again  --  Dulcy and Lynn and these two raw beginners were all made overnight . I could see that after the second act , but Kaufman and Connelly , poor innocents , suffered right on . Lord , how
