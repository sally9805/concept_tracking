txt Our weather all week was obviously the result of a mix-up between the groundhog and St. Swithin . It is really not very hard to coin superior epigrams about a disarmament conference meeting under war clouds . The only difficulty is to find anybody to whom it makes us feel superior except ourselves . Great Britain will impose a 10 per cent tariff on all except a few imports . They call 10 per cent a tariff in Great Britain ! Olympic Sidestepping Championships . As to the League of Nations , the attitude of the various Democratic candidates can be easily summarized . Candidate A believes in the League of Nations , but does not think it likely that the country will be ready for it before the Chinese learn to love the Japanese . Candidate B once was very fond of the League of Nations , but lost all patience with it when it went in for beach pajamas , berets and painted toe-nails . Candidate C is still for the League if by that term you understand the National Professional Hockey League . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as if the League of Nations created by a Democratic President has nothing to do with them and must belong to an elderly lady who left the train at 125th Street . And in the meanwhile a Republican Secretary of State writes notes to the League of Nations assuring it of his hearty support , and a Republican President appoints delegates to a Disarmament Conference sponsored by the League of Nations , and American judges sit on the League 's World Court , and altogether we give a pretty good imitation of a member of the League of Nations . It is a sign of partisanship sobered by public emergency that Republicans at Albany now defy Governor Roosevelt on page 4 instead of in their normal place on the first page . The only compensation when a war crisis floods the newspapers is that it makes the rest of the world outside the war zone seem almost livable . The New Ambassador . Taxpayers can not but rejoice heartily that Mr. Mellon has been made Ambassador to England after he has seen service as Secretary of the Treasury , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London in 1921 and coming back now to be Secretary of the Treasury . Heewould be returning from a country where the normal income tax is pretty nearly 25 per cent and in the highest brackets runs up to 60 per cent ; where the inheritance tax goes up to 50 per cent , and where the tax on a bottle of whisky  --  here cited for purely historical reference  --  is said to be several hundred per cent . Coming back from England with such notions in his head , it will be generally admitted that Mr. Mellon , as chief taxmaster , would have been an uncomfortable person to live with . But the way things have turned out he is likely to be the only sufferer . As he looks about him at the taxpaying British public , Mr. Mellon will no doubt experience keen regret over the opportunities he overlooked at home . But what are his feelings against those of so many of us ? Fair Play Is Called For . Tammany Hall , we are getting to feel more and more strongly , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable organization are subjected to persecution when they should be having medals pinned on them . The searchlight is trained on their peccadiloes . A conspiracy of silence surrounds their eminent services to the community in these difficult times : 1 . More than once we have called attention to the fine example of personal selfcontrol and civic responsibility furnished by Tammany district leaders during the late lamented boom . At a time when everybody was gambling in the market , when college professors hocked their life insurance to buy Wild Cat Common , and aviators went without overcoats to buy bank stock , and babes in arms went without their teething-rings to take a flier in Utilities , what do we find the men in Tammany doing ? We find them doing everything imaginable with their money except gamble in Wall Street . They keep their money in tin boxes . They lend it without security to their brothers-in-law . They leave it lying around on the mantelpiece . And for not throwing away their money when everybody else was doing it , they have been censured by Judge Seabury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the opposite direction . Mr. Hoover has just appealed to the American people to stop hoarding . At the same time we indict the Sheriff of New York County and his predecessor for  --  what ? For refusing to hoard ! Instead of letting the interest accumulate on public funds in their charge , it is alleged that they took the interest money and used it for their own purposes . That is to say , at least two men have been found who , it is claimed , did not let money lie idle but turned it into the channels of trade . And for that they are indicted ! , Abyssinian police officers were sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 100 Maria Theresa dollars for attacking the American Minister to the country , but the money fine has been remitted at the request of Secretary Stimson . We do not know what a . Maria Theresa dollar is exactly , but any kind of remitted dollar sounds good nowadays . Adolf Hitler has sent two observers to the Disarmament Conference . All he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy . Japan 's representative at Geneva felt it his duty to protest against the aggressive conduct of the Chinese army ; which would be a. novel kind of Shanghai gesture . ?
