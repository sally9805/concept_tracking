ARRIVAL ON A HOLIDAY A STORY BY WILSON WRIGHT WAS being shown Texas . It was the I Fourth of July , and a great many natives were looking at Texas too ; and our fast morning drive of about two hundred miles had shown me more of the chances of sudden death than it had of Texas . There is an unrestrained hilarity about the Texan style of driving , and when you added to this the fact that apparently Texas was the place old cars came to when they died , you had a fine feeling of hazard in what you were doing . You do n't see much of Texas in two hundred miles . In fact , you hardly see more than a long straight band of good new concrete wide enough for your car and another car to pass , and slowly getting narrower , according to the laws of perspective . Those laws were never interfered with by any irregularities of the landscape in the part of Texas I was being shown . Sometimes , though , waves of heat closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at infinity . Narrow , unpaved roads often came abruptly into the main highway , sometimes out of an area covered with trees , sometimes from behind a collection of wood and stucco houses with a filling station and a roadside restaurant among them , sometimes simply out of flat space . You could n't see what the country was like along these roads , but once or twice , when a car turned into the highway from one of them , you could tell fromthe appearance of the car what it probably was like . Those cars were always covered with dust , and the faces of the people in them were dusty too , and on the axles and under the mudguards there was always a caking of dried clay mud . We went down one of these roads finally , because we were hunting a short cut to a place where we could get some lunch . We had to go slowly because of the bumps and the washed-out places with muddy water still in. the bottom of them . Even if you were only a passenger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was unexpected when we came around a corner hidden by trees growing in a swamp , and found ourselves making the last in a line of four or five cars waiting to cross a little river by one of the ferries run by the Highway Department in that part of Texas . Apparently you always had to wait for some time at one of these ferries , because there was a store with a lunch counter in it just by the slip , and everybody who drove up simply left their cars standing in line , with the doors hanging open , and went into the store . They got a sandwich , or a piece of pie , and a bottle of soft drink , and then stood on the porch and quietly waited . We shut off our motor and got out , and as we did , an old model-T Ford came into the line behind us . It had more dust and mud on it and flatter springs than any car I 'd yet seen ; and what was more , before the driver shut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his engine was in . The gasket leaked , for one thing . The car could n't possibly have done more than stumble along from wherever it had come . We went inside to get a coca-cola and some cigarettes , but we sat down at the counter because it was cooler inside than out , and besides , the porch was full , and all the people there were making remarks to each other , and we 'd have had to fit ourselves into that if we went outside . There were three dogs too , out of the motors , and they scrambled back and forth among the people waiting , and panted . The man who owned the place was an Italian-Iooking man , though from the way he talked  --  exactly like all the people on his porch  --  you would n't have thought of his being a foreigner . We could n't get the kind of cigarettes we wanted . " Folks right around here do n't ask for that brand much , " lie said , " so I only keep the kind they mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind I keep seem anyhow willing to take them for once , so I do n't bother to keep more than the one kind . Anyhow , it 's all I 've got . " We bought those and started to drink our coca-colas , and he went to the other side of the store to talk to some friends of his that stood there . The screen door squeaked and then banged behind somebody , and a man said , in a general sort of way to everybody in the store , " Is Bill anywheres about ? " Everybody seemed to agree it was the storekeeper 's place to answer , because they stood and said nothing ; so he said , " Maybe you mean Bill Russell ? " Nobody said anything . " Or maybe it 's more likely Bill Harding you want ? " he suggested hopefully . I looked over my shoulder then at the man standing with his back against the screen door . He was n't very big , and he had on an undershirt and a pair ofblue dungarees and dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair , bleached and streaked with red dust , stood blown all ways from his head . I guessed he had come up in the Ford because the dust stuck with sweat around his eyes was the same color as the dust I 'd noticed when the Ford drove in behind us . " Well , I do n't rightly know which of those two Bills I 'm a-looking for , but the one I mean was in the army . He was in B-Company at that big camp place up-state . Maybe you-all can tell now ? " he asked . His listeners shook their heads . The storekeeper thought that it could n't be Bill Harding because he 'd never heard of Bill Harding being in the army or at a camp . ' Bill works on a ferryboat roundabout here , " the stranger mentioned . " He sent me a postcard saying he had a job on a ferry . I guess this is Hollis 's Crossing ? " " Sure , this is Hollis 's Crossing . " " Well , then , the Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's bound to be Bill Russell then . " " Then that 's all right , " said the man , wiping his forehead with his dusty arm and making fresh streaks . " I 'm sure glad to know his name 's Bill Russell . He just put ' Bill ' on the card he sent me . I knowed , easy enough , it was the Bill I knowed in B-Company because of what he put about ferryboating being easier than the army . But I could n't think of what he called himself , anyhow . " " Bill Russell ai n't around here to-day , " one of the storekeeper 's friends let out . " I seen him go off up the road on the other side of the creek first thing this morning . " This did n't matter to the man . He opened the screen door , and after it had banged behind him we heard him shouting to the people in his car , " Hey ! Hey ! Jenny ! Bring the kids . This is the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto a stool at the counter . " I 'm sure glad to find this Bill , " he told us , knowing we were interested and friendly , " because I came near to eight hundred miles to get here . " I was interested to hear this piece of information . I should have said it was impossible . But no one else seemed astonished . The storekeeper came around to the lunch-counter side of his store , and his friends began to drift across . There was quite a crowd interested in the man . " Eight hundred miles ? " the storekeeper calmly repeated . " That 'd be pretty far across the State . " " Well , it ai n't quite out of the State , " the dusty man seriously explained , " but it 's pretty far out in the sand . " The screen door opened and shut and let in a woman and two children . She was young and covered with dust , like her husband , and dressed in one of his khaki shirts and a pair of breeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high-heeled pumps . They made her walk a little shakily , or perhaps that was the result of sitting so long holding the baby in her arms and with the little boy crowded in between her and her husband on the front seat . The baby was in one of those five-and-ten bathing suits , and the boy had on some blue overalls . He was sunburnt red and brown where they did n't cover him . He saw his father at the counter as soon as he got inside . " Want a cone , " he said . His mother followed him and took the stool beside her husband . " I could do with a coca-cola , " she said . " Bill 's name is Bill Russell , " he told her . " Well , I 'm sure glad to hear what his name is , " she answered in a pleased way . " He ai n't here now . I mean right at this minute . " " Well , if this is where he 's at , we can wait till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future for them , so they started to drink their coca-colas . But the notion amused the storekeeper 's friends . They laughed , and then one of them said , " I sure hope you people got lots of time tospare . This here 's a holiday to-day , you know , and usually when Bill takes a day off like to-day , he goes and gets himself good and drunk . He might stay drunk two and three days maybe . " " Time ai n't no concern o ' mine , " said the man cheerfully . " Bill 's a-getting me a job , so I 'm happy to wait . " This news interested his listeners even more than his simple narrative , because they thought they knew of every job in the neighborhood . " Oh , " said the storekeeper , " you 're a-coming to work ? " " Sure thing . I want some work to do . Maybe you do n't know I dropped a job to come here . I would n't like to try to go no further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do n't mean I 'm tired o ' work in general . But aside from that I 'll be right pleased to see Bill again , I 've been a-thinking of that ever since I got his card . " His wife broke in . She had emptied her coca-cola bottle . " That tasted good , " she first said , and then she did some of the explaining . " He had a job in the garage at Holy City . That 's where we come from . It 's a thousand miles . He changed and fixed fiats , and that kept him pretty busy out there in the sand . But it was kind o ' tough out there because the boss started picking on him . And it was pretty tough too , getting milk for the kid , like a magazine I read in the barber shop said you ought to do . So when he read me this card from Bill , and told me about who Bill was , I said he 'd never find a better time to pull out than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She told all of this in a matter-of-fact way . Her husband completed the story . " You sure get tired of being in a place like Holy City . Why , they do n't change the movies but once a week there . " " There ai n't no movie house at all here , " said the storekeeper . " No , but it ai n't so far to town , " the woman argued . All the listeners nodded sympathetically . " Maybe we 'd better eat here now , " the woman suggested . So they had hot-dogs and pie and more coca-cola , and then the boy had a hot-dog and some milk . The baby did n't seem to be worrying about food . The storekeeper looked at the woman inquiringly , but she said , " No , I go on a-feeding her myself . " While they ate , the general talk went on . It was mostly questions and answers , all very direct and searchingly personal . No one felt any restraint . The little boy had an ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't guess there 's any use a-going to hunt Bill out to-day ? " the man asked , after borrowing a cigarette from me . " Sure to be no use , " somebody replied . " Bill ai n't changed much , " said the man , dropping the idea of a search . " I remember from camp , it was always best to wait where you were at for him . " A man put his head in the door and spoke indirectly to everybody : " Are you folks going on this boat ? All the cars in front of you went . " Bill Russell 's friend answered for us all : " You-all puIl out around me , if you please . We aim to sit here a bit . " We , however , got up and left . But by the time we got down to our cars a good many of the string had got in in front of us . The ferry had blown its whistle and started to move away too . So we went back and leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the talk . They had got on well with their questions while we were outside , because it seemed to me that the important point was finally reached just after we came in again ; and it certainly had n't been in sight when we went out . " There ai n't no more jobs on that ferryboat , friend , " the storekeeper was saying . " Those are the best-liked jobs around here , and people keep to them . Bill Russell 's had his near a year . " The man seemed a little disappointed . " Well , I sure thought when Bill said he was on a ferryboat that he 'd find me a place on that boat too . I 've sure been a-thinking that . " " I do n't rightly see how that 'd be likely , " a man said reflectively . He was on the stool I had vacated . " It takes only two men to run that boat . The State hires four and they work eight-hour shifts . And they do n't run it at all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He thought for a moment and then spoke along the counter , past the stranger who was listening dispassionately , to an acquaintance beyond : " Sam , I 'm clean out of my mind . What 's that other fellow 's name ? " Sam said , " His name 's Heron , Jim Heron . He does the afternoon turn along with Ebee . " " Sure , I recollect it now . Jim Heron . " Then he turned to the stranger and completed what he had started to say . " I do n't rightly see how Bill could do anything much . Maybe , as I see it , he promised more than he could do . " " No , he did n't rightly promise nothing , " said the man comfortably . " He would n't act like that . No , he just wrote he was a-working here ; and when I heard that it came on me I 'd like pretty much a-working where he was . So we pulled out and came . He did n't promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , do n't know I 'm a-coming . He 'll be right surprised . " Though he showed no sign that he was cast down , his wife said to him encouragingly : " Sure , even if he do n't have no job on that ferryboat , he 'll be bound to know lots a people , since so many goes on the boat all the time . " None of the natives of Hollis 's Crossing seemed to find anything out of the way in this situation . The only comment came from someone on the edge of the group . He remarked , " Bill do n't usually feel too good after he 's been having a holiday like this . " This was taken as a simple statement of fact , and , as such , it Ied to nothing . The family ate pie for a while . The baby woke up . " I 'd best go and feed her , " the mother said , unbuttoning the neck of her shirt as she slid from the stool . " You-all ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the car , " she politely added . They all said , " Sure , Ma'am , it 's what you feel most like . " She teetered through the screen door on her high heels . The ferry whistle blew coming in . " You-all could n't tell me whereabouts I might stop till Bill comes along ? " the stranger asked , pushing away his plate . " I ai n't got a lot o ' money left after coming so far , but I aim to rest here till I get a-working with Bill . " The men around him honestly racked their brains . The storekeeper spoke up first . " Maybe you could get into my shed with your car . There ai n't no conveniences there , but maybe it 'd do . " The man laughed happily at this easy solution . " We 've slept in my old car before this . And you should 've seen the way Bill and me lived at that camp . " " Well , it 's just around the end of the store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the man , suddenly thinking of it , " we can get hot-dogs and cokes , and maybe even milk in here ? I got money enough for that . " " Sure thing , " said the storekeeper . " I 'll go and move her in , then , " said the man as he took some change from his dungaree pocket . We got out of the door before him and into our car . I heard the Ford hiss through its leaky gasket behind us . He blew his horn , one of the old hand klaxons , happily . I had n't heard one for years . Then we pulled ahead toward the slip . We had to wait our turn before we could run on the boat and so the model-T came up beside us on its way to the shed . The driver waved his hand . His wife was still feeding the baby . The little boy 's face , smeared with ice cream , stuck up between them . A dog I had n't noticed before sat on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Then the Ford stalled . The man got out , twisting himself skillfully under the steering-gear . We had n't moved yet , so he came over to us . " Ai n't it damn-all , " he said , " a-stopping like that just in sight a home ? " One of the ferrymen shouted to us and we had to start . The man called to his wife : " flurry up with that kid 's supper , Jenny . You and me 'll have to push this thing in and get us settled . " The ferry blew its whistle , and I did n't hear what she said , but I suppose it was something cheerful and undisturbed .
