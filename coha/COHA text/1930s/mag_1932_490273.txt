ILE silly , light people were blowing horns and breaking bottles at the hour of midnight on New Year 's Eve , we quietly dialled ME ridian 7-1212 to discover how the Telephone Company celebrated . " When you hear the signal , " said the operator 's voice , " the time will be eleven fifty-nine and three-quarters " ? bong ! In the streets the shouting and noise-making was reaching a crescendo . " When you hear the signal , " said the operator 's steady voice , " the time will be midnight " bong ! Pause . " When you hear the signal , the time will be one-quarter past midnight " ? bong ! There you are : no monkeyshines for the Telephone Company , just the **26;657;TOOLONG lowdown . We were too quick for the girl , though . " Happy New Year , baby ! " we shouted back at her , and then sat down and figured out on our cuff that she had only 2,108,159 more bongs to announce before it would be 1933 . Bong ! MR R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ihnetican Legion Monthly a review of Frederick Palmer 's " Newton D. Baker : America at War . " We recommend it , as a piece of prose and as a pearl of public service . IVe have known a number of other people ( most of them less articulate than Mr. Woollcott ) who have had , as he has had , the opportunity to detect in Newton Baker a peculiar absence of bombast , circumlocution , and political prettiness , and we share with all these people the acute , almost painful , desire to march to the polls next fall to cast a vote for him . It is our notion that the most pertinent equipment a President could have at this palsied moment in history is the experience of having once directed the War Department . Mr. Baker 's firm and expressed international convictions must gather much of their present strength from his pocket memoranda of war and from his observation , during the past dozen years , of its stunning fruitfulness . WE have observed of late a ten- dency on the part of advertisers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Advertising , in fifty years , has grown more spirited , more honest , more influential , and more subtle ; it has also grown more obscure  --  approaching , occasionally , complete obscurity . It is sometimes quite difficult now to detect what product is being advertised merely by glancing at the advertisement , a difficulty that can be met either by reading no advertising at all or by reading all advertising very carefully . A certain portion of advertising is written to indulge the literary propensities of the persons writing it , and that particular increment is paid for by the consumer , through the nose . Morris Ernst , in an article in the Nation last week , included among other panaceas for government the suggestion that the libel laws be amended so that commodities could be criticized in much the same manner and with the same freedom as plays and books . This , he says , would eliminate some of the economic waste of advertising . We think very likely it would . A critical and comparative report of a new commodity written by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much of the fulsome stuff designed simply to overcome the so-called sales resistance of a suspicious public . TO our mind , the farthest north ( or should we say the deepest down ? ) in philatelics will be reached by the expedition that has chosen for its goal the sunken Lusitania . That poor , surprised , old wreck is to be visited , you know , by a colonic device big enough for a diver to walk through ; but that visitation is only the bare outline of the plot . We are prepared to convey to stamp-collectors the glad tidings that there is considerably more to the expedition than a mere descent into the sea in search of treasure already there : treasure is , in fact , to be added by hand . An airplane hearing a special waterproof sack of mail is to fly from Ireland to the scene of the wreck , the mail is to be lowered to the deep and chilly deck , and is then to be brought back to the surface by a diver . There will he no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out " in the presence of an accredited notary from Ireland . " This project , for reasons that we can not readily analyze and to which we do not intend to give a second thought , affects us with a gentle yet persistent nausea . Radio Audience ( NE fine starlit night in America , Mr. Ely Culbertson 's voice was floating out over hill and dale , via the National Broadcasting Company 's network . In the quiet home of a Mr. Scheltz , tailor , up in the little college town of Ithaca , New York , sat Mr. Scheltz , listening . " Ely Culbertson , " he mumbled softly to himself , " Ely Culbertson  --  where have I heard that name before ? " Mr. Schcltz left his radio and got out an old account book , in whose yellowing pages he finally found the following entry for 1909 : " Ely Culbertson , $38 , suit . " Mr. Scheltz turned off the radio . " Take a letter , " he said to himself , as he sat down with pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care National Broadcasting . Dear Mr. Culbertson : I am bringing to your attention a little matter , etc. , " and went on to remind him of the old days . A short time later , Mr. Scheltz received a friendly note inclosing a cheque for thirty-eight dollars . He now keeps the radio going morning , noon , and night . Local Estuary WHILE swimming in the East WHILE last week , we noticed how much warmer it seemed than either the Hudson or the Bay . It actually is about five degrees warmer , and the reason is , we discovered , that the powerhouses along the hanks heat it up . There are ten big powerhouses , sucking water in , expelling it . When it comes out it is hot . Between five and seven o'clock at night , when inure electricity is being used than at any other time of day , this **25;685;TOOLONG process goes on at a great rate . It would not , however , affect the temperature of the East River much were it not that the East River is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is one of our favorite words . Well , to go on with the story instead of flowing swiftly to the sea the way a real river does , this estuary simply goes skipping , shipping up and down Manhattan Island , lapping the apartment houses and providing a convenient place for tides to back up into . Thus the hot water from the powerhouses really heats it up . The East River has n't frozen over in years and years , and the National Electric Light Association of 420 Lexington Avenue predicts that it never will again . Look Out ! YOU know those signs on the walls of buildings which read : " Bell ringing signifies rising elevator . " You hear the bell ringing and slowly the iron doors on the sidewalk open , disclosing a rising platform with a nest of barrels and cans . A man was standing on some doors looking in a store window one day when he heard a bell ringing beneath him . He stepped aside and watched the wings open and the elevator come up . On it stood a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . The regular bell was n't working . Accepted ANOTHER Western Union story : I At the Yuletide , a gentleman wrote out some telegrams of Christmas greetings and sat down to dictate them over the phone . One of the telegrams was to his broker and read : " Am not hanging my stocking this Christmas . Stop . Am hanging myself . " He dictated that to the lady at the other end , and when it was finished there was a pause . Then she said : " Will you hold the wire a moment , pleeuz ? " When she finally returned to the phone ( apparently after a huddle with some executives ) , she begged pardon and asked if that part about hanging himself was a joke . The gentleman said yes , it was , and did she think it was funny . She gave a feeble laugh  --  the 01 d Western Union laugh and allowed that it was , but she added , crisply : " You know we could not be held responsible if you hanged yourself . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . " Broadcast B ox 44 , Grand Tier , Metropoli- tan Opera House , is a busy place these Saturday afternoons , being filled up solidly with Deems Taylor , radio technicians , and little knobs . From it they control the opera broadcasts . Under the contract signed , opera broadcasting will go on now for at least a couple of years , an hour and a half of it every Saturday afternoon , compliments N.B.C . Most of the machinery is in Box 44 , although the microphones which actually pick tip the music are hidden in the footlights and hung over the orchestra , simply drinking it in . There are three pairs of them , one pair on each side of the stage and one over the orchestra . Only one of each pair is used . The other is in reserve in case anything goes wrong . N.B.C . wanted to have two big parabolic microphones hanging under the balcony , one on each side of the house , but the Opera management said no , that the patrons beneath them would get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway because parabolic microphones look like horseshoe crabs . Box 44 was chosen because it has a good view of the stage and because nobody has subscribed for it for Saturdays . During broadcasts it is occupied by three N.R.C. men : Charles Gray , Edwin Dunham , and Wilbur Resides . Mr. Taylor sits in the rear in a little soundproof compartment of his own . When he wants to talk , he signals with a little red light . Mr. Gray thereupon turns the music off and Mr. Taylor on . Mr. Dunham and Mr. Gray sit side by side , Mr. Gray before the knobs of the mixer panel and Mr. Dunham before a score of the opera . Mr. Resides sits in front with headphones . Mr. Gray has headphones too . He controls the volume of sound . When the singing is on the left of the stage , he turns up the microphone at the left , and so on , until he gets dizzy . If he does , then Mr. Resides can take his place until he too gets dizzy . Mr. Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't drown out the singers . He is pinched frequently by Mr. Dunham . The men ca n't talk for fear of disturbing adjacent music-lovers and have worked out a system of signals by pinches . Mr. Gray has to know what 's coming so he can turn the mikes down for loud passages and up for soft ones . Mr. Dunham keeps a few bars ahead on the score . When a crescendo is approaching , he grips Mr. Gray 's arm and squeezes . If a really big noise is coming , like the stove explosion in " 1-15nsel and Gretel , " Mr. Dunham pokes Mr. Gray hard in the ribs Mr. Gray wears a two-piece headset . With one ear he listens to the music and with the other to a group of advisers in the N.B.C . studio , who tell him how the opera is coming in there . The microphones in the footlights are padded to keep out the voice of the prompter . It sometimes gets in just the same . These mikes have switches near them . To turn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mr. Resides  --  has to go backstage , climb four ladders , walk a bean : seventy-five fret above the stage , climb down some ladders , and reach a switch . Or that was the way of it at first . They were going to have it changed ; probably have by now . ? ANIC-ING and railroad men have been passing a little joke around this week , to wit : A father took his small son into a toystore and the lad was very much taken with a miniature train . The boy was very insistent about having it . " All right , " said the father , " hut just wait until tomorrow . I might be able to buy the New York Central for you . " Greenleaf THE world's-champion pool-player , Mr. Ralph Greenleaf , shoots ivory halls into pockets so beautifully that we felt like taking our hat off to him as to a fine surgeon when we watched him the ther night . We did n't , however , because none of the other fifty or more fellows who looked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take their overcoats off . Mr. Greenleaf played a Mr. ' Woods , in a little exhibition-room o f the Strand Billiard Academy under the noisy Broadway sidewalk at Forty-seventh Street . There were the street noises from above , the click of halls and the sound of voices from a huge public pool hall just off the little room , and various sounds from the audience , which smoked , murmured , and shelled peanuts ; but all of these distractions did n't affect the champion 's marvellous precision . Mr. Greenleaf arrived late , carrying his cues in a tall , slim bag . Under the sharp light of the pool-table lamps , he seemed six feet tall and strong ; but he is not very tall and rather delicate-looking , we found later . He wore a business suit with a double-breasted coat , which he kept buttoning and unbuttoning ; a pale-blue shirt and a pale-blue tic . ( You wear evening clothes only at championship matches . ) He has pale-blue eyes and long lashes and , just now , a bad cold . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady as steel . Mr. Woods , who spent most of the hour watching his opponent , like a machine , shoot balls into pockets , played with his coat off but kept his vest on . He looks like one of those men you meet behind money-order windows in post offices , and seems faintly melancholy . The champion won easily . He made one run of sixty-nine , Mr. Wood 's best being only nineteen or thereabouts . Greenleaf missed only one shot , and when he did half lay on the table , in mock collapse , staring incredulously at the ball , and then walked out of the room for a while . He almost never misses a ball ; his runs al e usually ended when his cue-hall goes into a pocket . Greenleaf is thirty-two and has won the world 's championship eleven times in the past thirteen years , first when he was nineteen . He began playing when he was six ; there was always a table in his house . The longest run he ever made was in 1923 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing . The official world 's record is only a hundred and twenty-six , made , it so happens , by Greenleaf himself . Official records have to be made in championship matches , and Greenleaf has made his best runs in exhibition games . Last week at the Strand , he casually ran off a hundred and sixty-seven . Nobody has ever come very close to his two hundred and sixty-nine . Mr. Greenleaf makes a lot of money playing exhibition games in various cities . After such matches , he does trick and fancy shut . We expected every minute , while we saw him doing some , that lie would bounce the ball off some gentleman 's derby and cause it to come back and push the three-ball in the pocket . That 's about the only thing he did n't do . Lady Luck NE of the workers for un-employment relief is the daughter of a well-known horseman  --  which has n't got anything to do with the story but is our way of starting it . She sat at a desk some weeks ago and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the drab line that slouched past her was brightened by the appearance of a well-dressed colored gentleman . It was one George H. Johnson , in search of relief . " You look well fed , " said the lady doubtfully . " Ah feeds good , " said Mr. Johnson . " You look strong , too , " said the horseman 's daughter . " Yassurn , " said Mr. Johnson . It came out that he made a living shooting crap , or had until the depression , but now nobody had any money to put into the roll of the dice . The rules of the unemployment-relief committee did not cover crap-shooters , but the lady wanted to be fair . She told him she could get him a part-time job moving bales in a warehouse . Mr. Johnson said he did n't have no sperience movin ' no bales and what he wanted most was money . The worker finally asked him if he had his dice with him , and out he brought them , like a flash . " I 'll roll you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you win , I 'll give you food orders for a week . If I win , you move hales . " They settled down to shooting the dice . You 're wrong about how it ends . Mistah Johnson win . A Model Past WE recommend to ladies and gentlemen and little boys and girls the new Museum of the City of New York , which has just opened . We went up there last week  --  to Fifth Avenue and 104th Street  --  and had a fine time looking at things . Scaffolding was still up then , sculptors of miniatures were arranging wax figures of Indians and Hessians and petticoated ladies in various displays , a man was daintily monkeying with the intricate mast of a clipper-ship model , and workmen were hammering and banging , but there was an odd air of tranquillity anyway . Right off we encountered a model of the old Blue Bell Tavern , which in 1770 stood at what is now Broadway and 181st Street , and which we wish stood there now . The scene is of a little wax lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have stopped in front of the old inn . The tavernkeeper beams in the doorway . This is the work of Mr. Ned J. Burns and is one of a series of Old New York miniatures he has done . 13 Even workmen chewing tobacco stood dreamily in front of his exhibits : laughing people sleighing in Central Park , Indians lounging about Inwood Park , Bowling Green when it was a nice place . One of the most enchanting miniatures is the interior of a Pearl Street blacksmith shop in 1830 . Wheels , anvils , the forge , the horses are all there . The horseshoes in it are as small as a baby 's fingernail . Through the open door you see the sunlit street and the front of the old Walton House , more pleasant even , we thought , than the front of the new Waldorf . Dwight Franklin , another genius in miniature figures , has done the inauguration of Washington , Nathan Hale before General Howe ( the General holds an impossibly small glass of red wine in his hand ) , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Street in the days when clipper ships tied up at the docks there and stuck their bowsprits ( or is it jib booms ? ) across the street to within a few feet of the upper windows of the old buildings , forming a strange canopy . Franklin worked for four years or so on his historical models and dug patiently into old histories , letters , and manuscripts to find out what the uniform of the Twenty-third Welsh Fusiliers ( Howc 's men ) looked like , what size man Hale really was , and which leg Stuyvesant lost . Hale 's figure was much stockier , he found , than in the City Hall Park statue of him , and Stuyvesant lost his right leg . At any rate an officer said he did in a poem he wrote about Peter , which Mr. Franklin came across . Only two of the five floors of the Museum are open now , but that 's all you can do comfortably at one time . On the second floor is the Museum 's prize piece : the old Americus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built for the Cherry Hill fire lads . The front of it is adorned with the painted head of a tiger , the very c that Thomas Nast picked out as the symbol of Tammany when he began to draw mean things about it . There are also , upstairs , all kinds of old lavender ball gowns and Colonial silverware , which the ladies can look at while the gentlemen sneak hack to the blacksmith shop and the South Street ships , and also for a look at the model of New Amsterdam in 1660 , done by Charles Capehart . It 's eight by eleven feet , with several hundred houses and nearly two thousand trees , and it took several years to build . The old town extended from the Battery north to Wall Street , and Cape-hart has put into it everything that must ever have been there at the time ; windmills , dogs , gardens , etc . The model was made from a plan of New Amsterdam known as the Castello plan , which was found some years ago in a villa in Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little old lady whom we write about once in a while went into a cordial shop one wet afternoon , thinking she would like a little sherry . " Bottle of sherry , " she said to a man standing behind the counter chewing a toothpick . " Alcoholic or non-alcoholic ? " he asked . This bothered the little old lady for a moment , but she decided to play ball with the law , and after all she did n't really want to get tipsy . " Non-alcoholic , " she said . " We have n't any , " said the man .
