About all that many people know about Kurds is contained in the lines of Hilaire Belloc : <P> The dromedary is a cheerful bird : I can not say the same about the Kurd . <P> These wild-eyed tribesmen scattered in mud huts through three countries-Turkey , Iran , Iraq-have had battle lust for 3,000 years , have never knuckled under to non-Kurdish governments . From Istanbul last week came news of probably the biggest riot of Turkey 's Kurds since the War . Operating from Dersim about 200 miles south of the Black Sea , 300 miles west of the Turkish-Iran border , Kurdish tribesmen with an army of 5,000 demanded that Dictator Mustafa Kaml Atatrk should establish no military garrisons in Kurdish territory , that Kurds should be allowed to keep their arms , should continue the time-honored custom of paying taxes by bargaining with their tribal chiefs . Kaml Atatrk gave them an answer-30,000 Turkish troops , a fleet of war planes . The rebels were dug out like foxes from their mountain holes , butchered to the tune of 5,000 . <P> No. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dictator Kaml Atatrk 's adopted daughter who last year became the first woman officer of the Turkish Flying Corps , and a pioneer in Kaml Atatrk 's movement to open all professions , even the army , to the tough , modern Turkish woman . She volunteered for service during the uprising , plunked a bomb on the house of Seyyid Riza , a rebel leader , killed him and so helped mightily to crush the rebellion . For her trouble the Turkish Government awarded her Turkey 's highest aviation honor , a medal set with brilliants . <P> All news of this bloody Kurdish affray- the climax , according to Prime Minister Ismet Inon , of " 659 recent disturbances in the Dersim region " - was carefully kept out of Turkey 's press until the last brigand had been sent flying .
