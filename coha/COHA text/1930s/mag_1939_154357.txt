In the rambling Boeing Aircraft plant on the Duwamish River near Seattle workmen last week were putting the finishing touches on five of the world 's most remarkable airplanes , the Boeing 314 flying boats for transoceanic service ( another is already completed ) . Forty-two-ton monsters each as high as a two-story house and as powerful as 6,000 horses , the four-motored ships are the largest ever built for commercial service . Last week in Manhattan , Pan American Airways President Juan T. Trippe announced that his company 's purchase of these six Boeings had been financed like ordinary railroad cars by the first full-fledged aviation equipment trust certificates. * <P> Three years ago American Airlines financed the purchase of some Douglas DC-3s and DSTs largely by equipment trust certificates sold to RFC . But Pan American had to seek no such professional giver of largess . It sold $2,500,000 worth of 4% certificates , maturing semiannually from January 1940 to January 1944 , to the hardheaded New York Trust Co. , has an option to sell it another $1,000,000 worth . <P> This provided 70% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard railroad equipment trust certificates . Nevertheless , aviation equipment trust certificates have yet to rival railroad certificates as gilt-edged public investments : there was no public offering of last week 's issue . <P> <P> * Equipment trust certificates are in effect mortgages on vehicles .
