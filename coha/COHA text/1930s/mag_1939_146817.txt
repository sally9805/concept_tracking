When a St. Louis theatre manager fortnight ago revived the cinema 's most eloquent preachment against war , All Quiet on the Western Front , that nine-year-old picture played to packed houses . Last week Universal , producers of All Quiet and of Author Erich Maria Remarque 's equally tragic sequel , The Road Back , announced plans to reissue both films . To All Quiet will be added a new commentary , fore &; aft , and some of the 3,000 feet snipped from the film after it left the hands of Director Lewis Milestone . Universal will also restore to The Road Back controversial footage on Nazi rearmament which was eliminated to spare German sensibilities , add new scenes and a few new characters , including Adolf Hitler . <P> Other war reissues promised or in prospect last week : H. G. Wells 's Things to Come ( 1936 ) , which proposes bombing cities with sleeping potion as a way to end war , The Big Parade ( 1925 ) , What Price Glory ( 1926 ) , Cavalcade ( 1933 ) .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
