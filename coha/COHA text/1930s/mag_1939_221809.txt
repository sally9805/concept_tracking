Francis of Assisi , simplest and kindliest of saints , lived in an age when Christendom sent army after army to wrest the Holy Land from the infidel . Burning to convert , rather than slaughter , the paynim , St. Francis took Palestine as a province of his order , before he or his followers ever laid eyes on it . When he did arrive there in 1219 , the little saint settled Franciscans in some of the Holy Land 's holy places . In 1333 , by treaty with the Sultan , and with papal approval , Franciscans were awarded permanent " Custody of the Holy Land " - i.e. , care of its Christian fanes . <P> The Custody still stands . Last week the 151st Franciscan Custos ( custodian ) , arrived in Washington , D.C. for a visit . A merry , bespectacled , red-bearded Italian , Most Rev. Albert Gori , the Custos ( also called " His Paternity " ) put up at the Franciscan monastery of Mt . St. Sepulchre . There he was visited by many a priest , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Object of His Paternity 's trip to the U.S. : to thank U.S. givers , to rally more givers to the Holy Land shrines . The Washington monastery , called the Commissariat and College of the Holy Land for the U.S.A. , and containing replicas of numerous Palestine fanes , is headed by a Commissary , Very Rev. Leonard Walsh . <P> Jerusalem 's Church of the Holy Sepulchre , which traditionally covers the site of Christ 's entombment , is shared by Franciscans , Copts , Abyssinians , Armenians , Orthodox Greeks , Syrians . The church is in danger of collapse , has been closed to the public pending $750,000 worth of repairs . The Franciscans , however , have repaired or rebuilt such shrines as the Basilica of the Transfiguration on Mt . Tabor , the Sanctuary in Aim Karem ( birthplace of St. John the Baptist ) . Chief holy place not under partial or complete Christian control is Jerusalem 's Room of the Last Supper , owned by an Arab family , which charges admission .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
