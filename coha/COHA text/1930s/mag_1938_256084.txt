On the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle early this month appeared an insulting blob of black type . In it Executive Editor Paul C. Smith announced imperatively that he was fed up with a dispute between San Francisco warehouse operators and C. I. O. warehousemen-the negotiators were bungling , and the C. I. O. members should return to work until the " hot " car that caused the dispute cooled off . The International Longshoremen 's &; Warehousemen 's Union dared him to take a hand . He accepted . <P> The " hot " car ( loaded by non-union workers ) of Woolworth 5- &-10; school supplies , whose visits closed 137 of 180 warehouses in the San Francisco Bay area ( TIME , Sept. 5 ) , was the device used by the Association of San Francisco Distributors to show what an employers ' union could do against a labor union . The hot car forced the employers ' issue : their demand that the union should give them a master contract covering all warehouses until 1940 . To I. L. W. U. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously won from individual employers and strait-jacket the union . <P> This was the clash of wills which Editor Smith had to reconcile . Last week he announced success : Longshoreman Harry Bridges and colleagues accepted a city-wide agreement ; the employers accepted a classification system to protect the union 's present status in each warehouse . <P> Meantime , a rival A. F. of L. union had won a local toe hold by signing a contract with a smaller association of warehouse operators . No. 1 provision : no strikes , no lockouts for five years .
