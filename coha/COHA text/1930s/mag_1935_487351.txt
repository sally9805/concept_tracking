N O MOVE that the United States could have taken at the London naval conference would have appeared more hypocritical than the proposal for a reduction of 20 per cent in total tonnage The Administration must have known that it would be rejected . In view of the recently announced increases in the French and Italian navies and the threat of new German construction , Britain is in no mood to consider reduction . Any suggestion that presupposes the continuation of the present ratios is a red rag to the Japanese . Since the United States is farther below its quota than any of the other powers , a cut would be much less expensive for this country than for Great Britain or Japan . It is obvious that no agreement is to be achieved unless the American delegation faces the issues realistically . Either we must give way to Japan 's demand for parity or we must enter into a collective agreement for maintaining the status quo in the East . If we desire disarmament  --  as vast numbers of Americans do  --  we must show our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask of other nations . And why not ? No country has greater natural security than the United States . A navy for purely defensive purposeswould be but a fraction of the size of our present fleet . If our naval force were reduced to defensive size , other countries would find it much easier to make reductions . Apart from the protection of our imperialistic interests  --  which mean very little to most Americans  --  is there any reason why we should not take the first step ? S HOULD MUSSOLINI ACCEPT the new " peace " plan drafted by Sir Samuel Hoare and Premier Laval , the League 's efforts to build a system of collective security would be effectively sabotaged . Ostensibly the scheme calls for an " exchange of territory " between Italy and Ethiopia . Italy is to be offered an area equaling approximately half of Ethiopia , while the African kingdom is to receive in return a narrow strip of territory leading to the port of Assab in Eritrea . Included in the land which is being offered Mussolini is a vast tract of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonization by Europeans . The proposal goes far beyond the ill-fated plan drafted by the Committee of Five prior to the outbreak of hostilities , and would give Mussolini more than his armies would be able to conquer  --  at their present rate of progress  --  for many months . That Laval has wished to " satisfy " Mussolini has long been evident , but Hoare 's approval , unless overridden by the Cabinet , can only mean that Baldwin has deliberately deceived millions of pro-League voters who gave him a specific mandate last month . Doubtless the unholy scheme will be defended on the ground that it removes the threat of an immediate war in Europe . Actually , however , the chance that Mussolini , weakened by the check to his armies in Ethiopia and harassed by sanctions , would attack England and France together is extremely remote . The primary danger of war in Europe lies in Hitler 's widely heralded thrust toward the East . If Mussolini obtains his empire by defying the League , all hope of that agency 's restraining Hitler will have vanished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain has been strengthened by his somewhat unexpected triumphs at home . Owing to the Radical Socialists ' unwillingness to assume responsibility for the devaluation of the franc , Laval 's fiscal policies were approved by a substantial if grudging majority . The attack on the government for its leniency toward the Croix de Feu and other fascist organizations proved more difficult to withstand But after three days ' heated discussion a formula was found which satisfied all but the extreme left parties . The so-called defense organizations , both of the right and of the left , are to be dissolved and denied the right to reorganize using uniforms , insignia , or arms . Anyone caught cariying a revolver to a public meeting is to be subject to a heavy sentence , and any individual or journal responsible for provoking political crime is to be dealt with severely . As a result of this agreement , not only the Laval government but democracy itself ; s given a new breathing spell in France ; the chances seem now distinctly against a fascist coup d'etat before the elections in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to a left government which is representative of the views of the majority of the population . T HE FIGHT to keep the United States out of the Berlin Olympic games has just begun ! The strength of the non-participation sentiment was indicated in the A. A. U. convention on December 8 when the vote by the union itself for adoption of the Steuer amendment urging further investigation in Germany was 54% to 43% ; when the vote of the allied organizations was added to the count , however , the proposal was lost by 2% votes . Jeremiah T. Mahoney , in withdrawing from the post of president and from the special committees of which he was a member , including the American Olympic Committee , announced that he would prosecute the non-participation movement with all the forces at his command , and would refuse to support campaigns for Olympic funds . The difficulty of raising the large sums necessary to send athletes to Berlin may be the final obstacle which the proponents of participation can not overcome . For it is becoming plainer every day that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic groups but includes many thousands of persons who , without any racial or religious stake in the matter , are intensely eager for the traditions of international sport to be upheld . This opposition is evidently nation-wide and it gathers strength and numbers every day . That the pro-participation forces in the A. A. U. recognized the nature of this protest is evidenced by their struggle to keep the issue from coming to a vote . Mr. Brundage , the new A. A. U. president , announced that the matter is now settled ; but it is not settled , nor will it be as long as advocates of fair play in sports have a voice . P OSTMASTER GENERAL FARLEY has finally canceled a ship-subsidy contract  --  one of the three held by the United Fruit Company for the service between New Orleans and Puerto Colombia . Farley has proudly announced that the company has agreed to carry the mails on a straight poundage basis , and that the cancelation will save the government about $4,000,000 ? approximately $544,000 having been paid out on a $4,571,658 contract . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first seems to be . The real facts of the matter are set forth in a report on the United Fruit subsidies submitted early this year to President Roosevelt by Farley himself . First of all , the United Fruit itself has for some time been trying to have the contract canceled  --  a small one compared to the other two , which will have yielded the company nearly $16,000,000 . Cancelation was requested because the contract provided that two new ships , costing about $7,000,000 , should be constructed by next March . One may still ask why the other two contracts were not canceled . All three of them were awarded through the most flagrant and unconscionable collusion , and in Farley 's own words , they " are therefore illegal . " The United Fruit 's Washington lobbyist was Elisha Hanson , who also hires out to the publishers . He earned his money . The contract advertisements so carefully specified the characteristics of the then existing United Fruit services that no other lines could possiliy enter bids . Needless to say , the $150,000,000 United Fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its profits were large , even during the depression ; the lines it operated were industrial lines , carrying bananas principally ; of its ninety-five ships sixty-four were actually flying foreign flags ; the personnel was interchangeable between the foreign and American ships , and the wages , hours , and living scales were the same . These conditions stillobtain . It is worth noting that Farley 's estimate of the savings to the government through the present cancelation is misleading : the $4,000,000 consists in large part of the greatly increased subsidies that would have gone to the line had the new and faster vessels been constructed . D ISAFFECTION in the ranks of the Socialist Party has been brewing for a long time . It is a healthy sign that at last it has taken the form of action in the recent withdrawal from the New York Central Committee of Norman Thomas and the left-wing group . Mr. Thomas withdrew after the introduction of a resolution which proposed to " reorganize " the party  --  with the leftists omitted . Louis Waldman , Socialist state chairman , read Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting at the Rand School on December 8 . But the national party organization has voted to send an official delegation to the left-wing convention in Utica on December 27 , which would seem to indicate that Mr. Waldman is without the fold and Mr. Thomas is safely inside . The split has been occasioned in part by a difference of opinion over the proper Socialist attitude toward Soviet Russia and over the more immediate question of a united front with the Communists . The Old Guard charges the left-wing faction with " efforts to commit the party to policies of armed insurrection , force , and violence . " The left wing answers this highly colored accusation by saying : " We are loyal Socialists who accept the constitution , declaration of principles , and platform of the Socialist Party and utterly reject control from Moscow . . . . What we want is not to make the Socialist Party Communist but . . . Socialist and efficient , something which it is not and has not been under the control of the Old Guard in New York City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to closer cooperation between the two leading radical parties , and hastens the formation of a national labor party . T HE CONSERVATIVE PRESS , which a year ago studiously avoided the implication of the income-tax figures , has shown ill-concealed glee in pointing out that the reduction in the number of million-dollar incomes from forty-six to thirty-two during the past year indicates a " redistribution of wealth " downward . On the surface there appears to be some justification for this claim . The number of individuals in each income class above $100,000 declined , while the number in each of the brackets below $100,000 increased . The total income of those receiving over a million dollars in 1933 was $82,000,000 ; in 1934 it was only $57,000,000 . To assume from these figures that the New Deal has aided the masses at the expense of the classes would , however , be faulty mathematics . Surely no one would maintain that American families which receive from $10,000 to $100,000 a year  --  less than % of 1 per cent of the total number  --  can be included among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group increased from 89,000 in 1933 to 129,000 in 1934 . The number of individuals receiving $10,000 a year or more rose more than 33 per cent as compared with the previous year , while the total net income of the 5 per cent of the population whose income was sufficiently high to be taxable increased 15 per cent over 1933 . The decline in the highest brackets may well be entirely accounted for by changes in the capital-gains section of the 1934 law which permitted a taxpayer to report only a fraction of his gains if the property had been held for a period of years . When we consider that the average weekly wage of industrial workers was only 1 per cent higher in 1934 than in 1932 , it will be seen that New Deal communism is yet a long way off . A RMED WITH NEW POWERS making him virtual dictator of Nanking 's rapidly dwindling domain , Chiang Kai-shek has apparently struck a deal with Tokyo by which China retains nominal and Japan assumes actual control of the Peiping-Tientsin area . The details of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the independent government of Hopei and Chahar will exercise full authority over all foreign , financial , military , and juridical affairs . Although the new " state " is considerably smaller than that originally planned by the Japanese militarists , Japanese jingoism has won another substantial victory . Spurred by the unexpected strength of the League in the Italo-Ethiopian crisis , Chinese public opinion had been demanding a showdown . Great Britain and the United States , with substantial interests in North China , had taken a definite stand against further Japanese penetration in violation of the Nine-Power Treaty . All of this potential opposition has been sidetracked , however , by the facts that the new regime will have the official blessing of Nanking and that it will remain nominally a part of China . Secretary Hull 's statement to the press reiterating America 's " faith in the fundamental principles of its traditional policies , " while mild in tone , was welcome as an indication of our continued interest in the Far East . By itself , however , the United States can do nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialism is to be curbed , it can only be through collective action . T HE CAPITALIST WORLD used to object to Bolshevik propaganda . It still does when that suits its special purposes  --  in a pre-election period , for instance . But now Bolshevik propaganda is entering a new phase in which the capitalists either pay for it or are paid for it . Thus the Turkish and Persian governments have contracted with Moscow to build modern industrial plants for them . That impresses the Orientals . They see Russia as Asia 's new industrial leader . Soviet engineers , workers , and machines help them improve their lot . Nothing could be more effective pro-Soviet propaganda . And its cost to the Kremlin is nil . Indeed , there is even a financial profit . In the West the crafty Bolsheviks have adopted a method of propaganda which is still more subtle . During the first ten months of 1935 the Soviet government purchased seventy second-hand ships , totaling 250,000 tons , in foreign countries , mostly Germany and Holland . But it bought them on one condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tight , dark quarters for the crew in the lower decks and put in roomy , pleasant cabins in the best part of the vessels for the Soviet sailors . Seamen are an international lot , and this innovation will be carricd by them to every corner of the world . In the bars of Shanghai , in the dives of Buenos Aires , German and British and Norwegian salts will be talking about the wonderful accommodations which the Bolsheviks provide their sailors . Even the London City is being bombarded with a new type of propaganda . The bankers and business men of England are impressed by the fact that in 1935 the Soviet government paid cash for literally all its orders in Great Britain . This is the real red menace , and it has obviously been in preparation for a long time . We suspect , in fact , that the first and second Five-Year Plans were conceived as parts of it . T WO IMPORTANT COMPLAINTS have been recently issued by the National Labor Relations Board under the Wagner Labor Disputes Act . The first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusing to reinstate Morris Watson for joining the American Newspaper Guild . The case will be heard on January 8 , and an answer by the Associated Press may be filed before that time . The board has also decided , in the case of the Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines , that the company has violated the law by forbidding its employees to organize and bargain collectively , and has ordered the reinstatement of discharged employees with back pay and the dissolution of the company union which the bus line had formed as a substitute for the labor union its employees wanted . Ivan Bowen , attorney for the company , has announced that no recognition will be given to the order of the board until it has been " passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction . " The United States Circuit Court of Appeals is the court in question , and it should be given an opportunity to review the order without delay . Such a test of the Wagner law can not come too soon . It is evident that the momentum given by the NIRA to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come before the labor boards , and such decisions as have been handed down have been defied or ignored by the companies against whom they have been issued . Both of the preceding cases appear to be clear-cut violations of the law ; the question to be determined now is whether or not there is a law to violate . T HE CHAIN GANG can not yet claim Angelo Herndon . An application for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the statute under which Herndon was convicted was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment was acted on by Judge Hugh M. Dorsey in Fulton County Superior Court on December 7 . Judge Dorsey ruled that the statute was in fact unconstitutional and that Herndon 's conviction and sentence , therefore , were " illegal , void , and of no effect . " Herndon is out on $8,000 bail for a twenty-day period during which the state may appeal the case to the Georgia Supreme Court . If it does , the Supreme Court of the United States may be expected to rule on it at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express an opinion on judicial processes , particularly with respect to the court of last resort . But if the Georgia insurrection statute is unconstitutional now , it was so while the Supreme Court was twice ruling that the issue of constitutionality had not been properly raised . Mr. Justice Cardozo , in a dissenting opinion , indicated that the technicality on which the court refused to take jurisdiction was a finely drawn one ; that it was drawn meant months in jail for the defendant , and more months are still ahead of him while the final appeal goes through its measured paces . Months , however , are undoubtedly better than years . In a comparatively short time Herndon may be free . His years in jail have made him many friends and have demonstrated the strength of the mass protest which as much as anything helped his cause to be celebrated and his freedom to be a matter of public concern .
