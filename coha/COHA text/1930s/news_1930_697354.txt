txt Bullish sentiment was heightened at the week-end by the statement of President Hoover that there was no grounds for anticipating discontinuance of the 177 , income tax reduction after the end of the present year . Mercantile reviews also were favorable , reporting that requirements for autumn were entering more strongly into the calculations of merchants . These authorities asserted that continued restriction of manufacture was operating to bring about the closer balance between supply and demand necessary for trade revival . In addition to the better feeling regarding the commercial outlook , leading stocks were strengthened in the abbreviated trading period by the impressive action of Friday 's market . With the principal industrials at the best levels n1 the current recovery despite heavy selling in special departments . experienced observers were looking ahead to extension of the present advance on prospects of better earnings in the major branches of trade .

Union Carbide and other pivotal industrials pushed through recent resistance levels on the upside , reaching their best prices since the culmination of the July recovery . Steel , General Electric , Westinghouse and General Motors were in demand around ' the highs of the present movement , and bullish demonstrations went ahead in Radio , United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpoint the action of the market over the last 10 days has been more favorable than at any time since the Spring rid ! was checked on April 17 by the non-fulfillment of hopes regarding a business upturn . Reactionary tendencies which developed at that time brought about a decline of 36 points in the Dow-Jones industrial average by May 3 , followed by a rally of 17 points to May 29 . Discounting the further recession in industrial activities during July . the principal Industrals then broke 64 points to the year 's low of 211.84 on June 24 , and recovered about 30 points by July 28 . Postponement of seasonal trade improvement occasioned by : ht. drought resulted in another reaction this month , carrying the industrial compilation down 23 points to 217.24 on August 12 . This narrowing of the downward swings was definitely encouraging , and the fact that the August setback was checked well above the June lows demonstrated that gradually higher support levels were developing . Moreover , the recovery since August 12 has made greater headway on a percentage basis than either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements , resistance was encountered after slightly less than 50%. of the previous reaction had been wiped out . By rising to above 232 in the last few nays , however , the main industrials have regained approximately two-thirds of the recession from July 28 to August 12 . Considerable importance is attached to this performance since price cycles since mid-April have demonstrated that a 50 " , - , - rebound was all that could be accomplished on technical grounds . That the current upswing is something more than a recoil from a temporarily oversold position is also indicated by the further ground gained since the abrupt upturn at the expense of the shorts on August 15 . Latter uprush erased only about half the previous decline . Hence , the market 's ability to go ahead to levels representing a 66% recovery suggests that the improvement has not been due to a speculative manoeuvre against over-extended bear accounts . It points strongly to influential accumulation , based on confidence regarding the eventual development of a moderate degree of prosperity during the fall months . Strong support stimulated by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that buying of this character again appeared at slightly higher levels on the reaction during the first two weeks of August indicated that dominant interests regarded the hot , dry weather as an accidental interruption of trade betterment . What has made the action of pivotal industrials during the past week more significant has been the power shown to extend the rally in face of adverse circumstances . Car loadings figures have shown the biggest losses of the year . Hudson Motor reduced its dividend , and common payments were suspended by Shell Union , one of the major petroleum companies . New lows fon , the year in such outstanding shares as Anaconda . Kennecott , Baltimore Ohio . and Southern Railway showed the influence which dividend uncertainties were ' having on speculative thought . However , the persistent strength in the main body of , stocks despite these unfavorable factors illustrated how strong was the belief that the steady recession in commercial activities over the last 12 months would be followed by conservative revival in coming weeks . In addition to the normal seasonal ' factors making for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtailment in production over the last several months , the main body stocks has derived subtsantial support recently from the drastically liquidated position existing in the general list . Although the value of Stock Exchange shares has appreciated about 10% since the . June lows were reached , brokers ' loans have been reduced approximately $288,000,000 in that time This decrease illustrates how rapidly stocks have been passing from weak to strong bands during the past two months . Conclusions of the same sort are pointed to by the tremendous expansion in the stockholders ' lists over the last seven or eight months . What a noteworthy force in bolstering technical conditions this reduction in the floating supply of representative stocks has been is shown by comparison of the present situation with that existing in July , 1927. the previous time when brokers ' loans stood at their current level of $3,128,000,000 . During the latter month the market value of stocks listed on the Exchange approximated 842,000,000.000 , and the number of shares totaled 620.000.000 . On the first of August . 1930 , the number of shares was 1,270,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more than 50% greater than three years ago . In view of the fact that brokers ' loans now are no higher than they were 37 months ago , an idea may be gained of the huge investment demand for American stocks , and the remarkable success which has been obtained in securing permanent lodgment of securities issued to finance the nation 's commercial development . ? Decline in net profit of the Sinclair Conseildated Oil Corp . to $3,251.709 for the six months ended June 30 from 86.196,195 in the same period of ' 1929 was disappointing to close followers of the company .

As far as carr be learned . AutoStrop has not approved an agreement , or accepted any terms , with a view to merging ' with Gillette . Aside from these negotiations . however , AutoStrop is making big gains in earnings this year . the first six months ' net topping that in the corresponding period of 1929 by 95% . Indications arc that for all of 1930 net will closely approximately $2,000,000 , a new high record , and equivalent to better than $7.30 a share on B stock , after allowing for dividends on A stock . In 1929 , net totaled $1,065,034. equal to $3.61 a share on B stock . Railroads are looking forward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to increase their earnings , which , as a result of the drastic decline in tralIic so far this year , have been so low as to imperil the safety of some dividends . Loadings have failed to show any seasonal increase up to now . Total for the ' week ended August 9 revealed a decline of 17.2% from last year , the greatest reported so far . However , the movement of freight has invariably showed increasing volume during the last half of the month and figures covering this period are awaited with keen interest . If the autumn advance in business materializes , the railroads will carry a larger part of the increase in gross to net income as they have rapidly been getting a firmer grip on expenses during recent months . The few individual earning reports for July received so far have , on the whole , shown substantial declines from 1929 .. Remainder of these reports will come out over the next week and it is admitted that they will make podr comparisons with corresponding months in preceding years .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
