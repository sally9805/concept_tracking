Toward the close of a lean year official Thanksgiving proclamations sounded in true martial style . There are still things for which we may be officially thankful . But if it be not treason to say so , may we regret that we are no longer young ? To responsible citizens fully acquainted with the realities of life , holidays are pleasant interludes in the sober progress of daily affairs . But to the young they are , or at any rate they used to be , days of extraordinary excitement . Long before they arrived you saw them looming up as red letters on the calendar , and when they arrived you knew that something definite was happening .

Grandfather carving the turkey with knife and spectacles , two uncles floundering helplessly over the ducks , aunts to any given number serving the potatoes , onions and turnip and passing dinner plates slowly around the table , put a full stop to idle discussions . After so much turkey only a hero could face the mince and pumpkin pies , and those who toyed with the nuts and raisins were braggarts . By this time Thanksgiving was practically finished . You could invade the game closet if you could walk that far . Toward the end of the afternoon the relatives assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there were light refreshments in the dining room . Bundling up in warm clothes and riding home through the sharp night was little short of torture .
