DOWN from the Bering Sea , a glistening brown horde of more than a million seals has just poured through the channels of the Aleutian Islands , headed away from the Alaskan mainland , and disappeared in the Pacific . Every fall , they vanish in this mystery of , migration . For four months , the Pacific swallows them up . Then they reappear off the coast of southern California , swarming north on the long journey home . At this point begins one of the strangest convoy services of the sea . Coast Guard cutters , putting out from ports along the way , a few months hence , will steam up the coast with the migrating animals , guarding them on their 3,000-mile journey to the treeless , mist-enshrouded Pribilof Islands in the heart of the Bering Sea . This unique patrol has been maintained for a quarter of a century . For the herds of the Pribilof Islands , comprising eighty percent of the fur seals of the world , are a prized possession of Uncle Sam . How the United States acquired these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , is an exciting story that goes back 150 years . In the summer of 1786 , a Russian adventurer , Gerissam Pribilof , was sailing cautiously through a lifting fog north of the curving chain of the Aleutian Islands when he heard a far-away , thrilling clamor ? the mingled voices of 2,000,000 seals roaring , barking , bawling , whistling at the same time . Working closer to the uproar , Pribilof found the black , volcanic rocks of several hitherto unknown islands literally alive with seals . He had stumbled upon a gold mine of furs , the legendary breeding ground of the Bering Sea herds . The five islands he found are volcanic peaks rising above the water 240 miles from the nearest point of land . Three are unimportant . Two , St. Paul and St. George , hold the rookeries of the seals . The combined area of the islands is less than seventy square miles . Without trees or shrubs or running streams , these dots of land are among the strangest islands known . During summer , they are covered with tinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for nine days out of ten , fog fills the air . It is this fog that makes the spot ideal for the seals . They can not stand much brilliant sunshine while on land , and the clouds of mist that shroud the Pribilofs make their summer home a sort of semiocean in which they live in comfort . This fog also played a part in the raids , battles , and bloodshed that have marked the history of the islands . When the Pribilofs came into the possession of the United States , at the time of the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 , the seals had been slaughtered by the hundreds of thousands . During the next forty years , while the Government leased the sealing rights to private concerns , the slaughter continued unchecked . Under cover of mist , poaching parties of British , Japanese , and American seal hunters would land on the islands and leave the beaches strewn with the bodies of dead seals . Lookouts kept a constant watch ; armed guards patrolled the beaches ; but the raids continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags of half a dozen nations , were circling the islands , waiting for a chance to land . Once , on a single fog-filled night , four raiding parties landed on different beaches at the same time . The muffled roar of their sawed-off shotguns seemed to come from all sides at once . Another time , a pitched gun battle between native guards and Japanese raiders left three of the poachers dead and seven captives . During the last days of the nineteenth century , Alexander McClain ? said to have been the original of Jack London 's " The Sea Wolf " ? and others of his kind were writing lawless chapters into the saga of the seal islands . By 1911 , the great herds that Pribilof had seen had been reduced  | to fewer than 250,000 seals . Poachers were following the migrating animals , killing them at sea ; they were waiting off the Pribilofs for mother seals to come out to feed ; for the hundreds that were hauled into the boats , they were killing thousands that sank and could not be recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail of the great sea otter , to extinction . Then , in 1911 , the seal herds of the Bering Sea were given a new lease on life . Japan , Russia . Great Britain , and the United States signed a treaty outlawing the killing of the animals at sea as well as on the islands . With Coast Guard ships circling the Pribilofs during the breeding season , and guarding the herds on their long migrations , illegal sealing has virtually ceased . As a result , the herds have increased until today they number more 1,500,000 . A decade or so hence , they may reach the peak figure of 2,000,000 once more . Already , the fur from this strange cluster of islands has brought Uncle Sam nearly ten times the whole purchase price of Alaska ! Only experts designated by the Government now kill the seals . Last year 57,000 pelts were shipped south for sale . To understand the scientific methods employed in the annual " seal census " which determines how many animals can be killed without endangering the herds , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost fantastic events that take place each summer on these misty isles . Along in May , the bull seals arrive . They are great , hulking brutes that may attain a weight of 600 pounds . Five times as heavy as the females , they have deadly teeth as sharp as sabers . Eskimos call them " the bears of the sea . " Year after year , the bulls hoist themselves onto the identical rocks they occupied the year before . There they wait , looking out to sea , for the return of the females . Oftentimes , more than a month goes by before the surf around the islands is filled with the bobbing heads of the homecoming wives . They , with the younger seals , had migrated  | far to the south . The bulls usually winter off the southern coast of Alaska . Immediately , each bull tries to collect the largest possible harem . A single male may have as many as 100 wives . The average on the islands is forty . As each female comes ashore , a bull picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kitten , and carries her to the few square yards of beach he defends as his own . Almost as soon as the females come ashore , the young seals are born . Each female has a single offspring , big-eyed and black . Later in the summer , its coat turns to the sleek , brown hue of its mother 's . Although the males are called bulls and the females cows , the young seals are referred to as pups ? and the congregating spots on the beach are known as rookeries ! D U RING the next six weeks or more , the bulls neither eat nor sleep . They spend night and day guarding and taking care of their harems . If a wife tries to escape , the bull grasps her by the back of the neck and flings her over his shoulder onto the rocks behind him . The big excitement comes , however , when one beach sultan tries to raid another 's harem . With a hissing roar , the outraged husband charges the interloper . Oftentimes , it is a battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival 's body into the adjoining harem ; the master of that area rushes at it and tosses it on to the next bull , and the process is repeated until the slashed and battered body of the defeated male lies discarded on the rocks . In a single season , a warrior bull may fight a hundred desperate battles in defense of his harem . By the end of the breeding season , the males , instead of being sleek and fat as they were when they arrived at the islands , are mere skin and bones . They are covered with wounds from head to foot ; their flippers are bitten and ripped ; their little , two-inch ears and tails are often in shreds . Slipping into the water , they swim off by themselves to spend the winter resting up for the next breeding season . Bulls are good for about six years of this intense activity . Later , the old and weakened males , the has-beens of the herd , congregate by themselves on sandy stretches of the shore . Other seals avoid sand because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick out pebbly or rocky spots when they clamber from the surf . The black rocks of the Pribilofs have been polished smooth by the'slithering bodies of millions of seals . CURIOUSLY enough , the baby seals are afraid of the water . They have to learn to swim just as humans do . When full-grown , however , they are so completely aquatic that they sleep stretched out on the rolling surface of the sea and spend months out of sight of land . A baby seal never recognizes its mother , but the cow will nose among thousands of pups clustered together in " pods " until she finds her own . As seals nurse only their own babies , pups starve to death if anything happens to their mothers while away on hunting expeditions which sometimes carry them a hundred miles from the islands . Thus , in the days of " pelagic " sealing , or killing the animals at sea , every female shot meant two seals gone , because the pup left motherless on the islands died too . As soon as the youngsters learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diving for shells and tossing them in the air , racing across lagoons , and playing tag in the surf . Occasionally , a blundering whale approaches the islands and the seals flock out in scores to dive under and leap over the monster . Oftentimes , when a Coast Guard ship anchors offshore in darkness and plays its searchlights on the water , the seals frolic and leap in the illuminated waves . And , when landing parties row ashore , the playful animals approach without fear and jump over the oars of the boats . Queerest of the customs at the islands is the treatment of the young males . The bulls are three years old before they begin to gather harems of their own . Before that time , they keep to themselves , playing in the water or romping on level parade grounds back of the rookeries . Narrow lanes are left between the harems , along which the young males can travel from the water to the parade ground . The jealous beach sultans ignore them , as long as they keep to the lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are killed for fur by the Government . To determine how many surplus males there are , the officials on the islands make an annual census , photographing the rookeries from identical vantage points each year . Rocks bearing symbols in white paint are easily distinguished in the pictures and aid in estimating the number of animals in the different rookeries . When it has been determined how many of the two-year-old bulls can be sacrificed without injuring the herds , preparations are made for the . strange annual execution . It is called " walking out the bulls . " The start is at midnight , with natives driving the animals slowly over the damp grass in the direction of a great open space strewn with the bleaching bones of countless seals . There are frequent stops for rest . If the animals become overheated , the fur is spoiled . On arrival at the slaughtering ground , the natives set to work . They are divided into four groups ? clubbers , stickers , rippers , and skinners . The clubbers stun the seals with heavy bludgeons ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals to insure their death ; the rippers cut around the necks and flippers , and the skinners remove the pelts . Members of each group are trained for their work from childhood . So expert art the skinners , for example , that they can strip a pelt from a large seal in fifty seconds , although it must be cut from the carcass all the way around . The flippers , under the skin , have ridges like fingers . Frequently . when a skinner 's knife becomes dull , he will sharpen it by stropping it on a flipper . One concern , the Fouke Fur Company , of St. Louis , Mo. , supervises the killing of the seals , the shipping and tanning of the pelts. and the auctioning off of the furs . Packed in salt , the skins travel nearly 4,000 miles to a two-story brick building in St. Louis where workmen tumble them about in revolving drums , knead and rub them , treat them with maple-wood sawdust and , finally , clip and dye the furs in preparation for the market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft that you can pull one through a circle made with your thumb and forefinger . Special vegetable dyes , perfected by the Fouke company , give the treated sealskins their different shades of color . Twice a year , in April and September , the furs are auctioned off in a flab draped room in downtown St. Louis . They are sold in lots of seventy to buyers who come from New York , London , Paris , and other fur centers of the world . Last year , the profit to the U. S. Government , after the commission due the Fouke company had been paid , amounted to nearly a million dollars . So , it is no wonder that , a few months hence , Coast Guard cutters will put out from San Diego , Calif. , Seattle , Wash. , and other points along the 3,000-mile route of the returning seals , to protect these valuable herds on their long trip to the Pribilofs.  |
