The armies of France and Germany last week executed two more steps in their slow , solemn , martial minuet between the Moselle and the Rhine , the Westwall and the Maginot Line . Germany stepped forward the distance that the French had advanced since Sept. 3 . The French , in perfect rhythm , stepped back , slaughtering the Germans as they came , as befitted accomplished war dancers . <P> The French high command made known that on Sept. 29 , seeing that Poland was prostrate and that pressure at the West-wall could not possibly revive her , they decided to alter their basic war plan from offensive to defensive . Unknown to the Germans they prepared a line of resistance behind a line of surveillance . When the German advance came last week , only French outposts remained . These withdrew slowly , leading the waves of German troops into a zone of red-hot cross-fire from machine guns and artillery . Of some 100,000 Germans involved , the French guessed they killed five to seven thousand . <P> But the German advance was no bull-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men although heavy reserves followed them . When the French counterattacked once or twice to inflict heavier punishment , the German secondaries stood fast , and their retreating firsts laid " tank asparagus " ( sharpened steel rails set at an angle in triangular base plates ) which halted French juggernauts . Where the French retreat was continuous , the Germans actually lost contact with them since , so polite was this party , Nazi orders were not to cross the French border . By week 's end the French had yielded , the Germans retaken virtually all German territory except a few ridges which the French retained as better strategic ground for defense than their own border hills . French heavy artillery busied itself dropping shells into a 20-square-mile area north of Sierck in the hope of landing one on Nazi field headquarters , believed to be somewhere near Castle Thorn . The French withdrawal from the Warndt Forest was effected four days before the Germans learned of it and was performed chiefly to escape flood waters . <P> Rains continued , the rivers rose and though evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front appeared due for another long lull while the war of blockades was intensified over the North Sea . <P> &gt; French politeness matched German when , before dynamiting a steel footbridge across the Rhine to the French powerhouse at Kembs ( in front of Mulhouse ) , due warning was given to the German side . Evacuation of 300,000 civilians from Mulhouse to Biarritz on the Bay of Biscay was begun by the French this week . This hinted that the French may expect a real German push at her Belfort Gate , south end of the Maginot-Westwall stalemate , or through the Swiss side door . &gt; Machine gunners on the forefront of the German advance wore steel armor covering them from neck to crotch . Weighing 30 Ibs. but only 1/20 in. thick , this gear was more psychological than practical . It would deflect only spent rifle or pistol bullets , was useless against aimed fire or grenades .
