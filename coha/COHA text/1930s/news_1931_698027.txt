txt The stay granted to Dr. William F. Doyle by Justice Henry L. Sherman of the Appellate Division was an " insignificant incident , " said Samuel Untermyer , a member of the Tammany board of strategy . yesterday in a statement attacking Samuel Seabury , chief counsel to the Hofstadter committee . Mr. Untermyer made no reference to the telephone call from the apartmerle of John F. Curry , Tammany leader , to Lake Placid , where Justice Sherman sixteen hours later issued the order saving Doyle from jail for contempt of the legislative investigating committee . Nor did Justice Sherman or Mr. Curry . Asserting that the " efforts of the Hofstadter committee seem to be to dramatize and magnify every insignificant incident , " Mr. Untermyer declared that Justice Sherman 's stay would have attracted no more than passing interest " but for the unfortunate , sensational crusading spirit with which it has been stirrounded .

Justice Sherman has signified his intention of being present , and the court probably will consist of Edward R. Finch , presiding justice , and Justices , Martin , O'Malley and Sherman . It was expected that Mr. Seabury would confine himself directly to the issue of whether Doyle should go to jail for contempt of the committee 's powers and avoid discussion of his charges of Tweed ring tactics in protecting Doyle from punishment unless called upon by the court to expand them . It is his intention to make the charges and the evidence he has gathered to support them the subject of a public hearing later before the committee of which Senator Samuel Hofstadter is chairman and for which he is serving as counsel .

" Irving Ben Cooper and Philip Wager Lowry of Mr. Seabury 's staff have begun an investigation to determine whether Mr. Whalen 's description of the charges las " trivial " was accurate . Some of the charges , it was said , were under investigation by Lewis J. Valentine , who eleven days before the amnesty order was issued was reduced by Mr. Whalen from the rank of inspector to captain . The reports filed by Valentine are being studied by Mr. Cooper and Mr. Lowry . awry Pia'em Golf . Mr. Untermyer was Tammany 's only spokesman yesterday .

In his statement , Mr. Untermyer described Justice Sherman as " one of the ablest , most upright and conscientious men on the bench , " and held that Mr. Seabury was making " much ado about nothing . " Mr. Untermyer , however , confirned his statement to answering the question : " Was there anything unusual in the granting of a stay ?

I do not recall one out of the many cases of this kind ? and there are many of them in the books ? in which there has not been a stay pending appeal from such an order , especially where , as here , the issue of law is a substantial one . " Mr. Falk had the unquestioned right to apply to any one of the justices of the Appellate Division , and I have no doubt that any one of them would have granted the trifling delay from Thursday to Monday to give this man , whether right or wrong , his day in ? court .

" If Doyle must answer those questions the courts will so decide in the next few weeks . As both the Federal and the State courts have been , for a year or more , threshing over this old straw  --  namely , trying to force answers from Doyle ? it would not seem unreasonable at least to allow him his day in court , nor important whether , if he is required to answer , he does so now or in a few weeks .

That is still my view . " If it should hereafter appear that Doyle , notwithstanding his oath to the contrary before the Federal grand jury , did in fact split fees with public officials , the committee by now granting him immunity , if it has the power , would have rendered it impossible to punish him hereafter . k " Can it be that the $1,000,000 Hofstadter committee ?
