Last week railroad men noted well that : <P> The I. C. C. authorized the Pittsburgh &; West Virginia to build a six-mile extension into the Donora , Pa. , steel district . The extension was granted over the loud protests of the Pennsylvania , once the great and good friend of the tiny P. &; W. Va. , changed by the threat of territorial competition into its determined enemy . <P> The Baltimore &; Ohio appeared well on the way to realize its consolidation ambitions . It announced that during 1929 it had acquired more than 250,000 shares of Reading stock , clinching once for all its control of the road over which it gains access to New York . An even more decisive step forward was the approval by the I. C.C. of the B. &; O. 's petition to acquire the Buffalo , Rochester &; Pittsburgh , for which it has long been angling . This prosperous coal road is a very desirable strategic link between Buffalo and Pittsburgh , the two Great Eastern Gateways . Over it the B. &; O. will reach Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The road will also be a vital part of the new low-grade freight route between New York and Chicago projected by the B. &; O. From the Alleghany Corp . of their allies , the Brothers Van Sweringen , the B. &; O. will buy control ( 84% ) of the B. R. &; P. for $14,263,000 . <P> The Shippers ' Conference of Greater New York made some telling points against the I. C. C. Merger Plan . Their specific criticism : that the Lehigh Valley should have been assigned to the New York Central instead of to the Wabash . Their general criticism : a doubt as to the wisdom of increasing the size of rail systems , thus reducing competition and removing responsibility for management further from direct contact with shippers . <P> The Wabash will shortly submit to the I. C. C. a revised merger proposal which will include an outline of the financing involved . This is in accordance with a letter sent out last week by C. D. Mahaffie , I. C. C. Finance Director , stipulating that details of financial arrangements must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the D. &; H. , the B. &; O. , and the C. &; O. , none of which have yet taken action on it .
