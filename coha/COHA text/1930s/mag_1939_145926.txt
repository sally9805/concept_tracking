Three months ago convivial L. M. Parton , secretary of the Nocona Chamber of Commerce , conceived a publicity stunt . His idea : a 2,000-mile pony express race from his little ( pop . 2,352 ) North Texas leather-manufacturing town to San Francisco , to tie Nocona to the tail of the Golden Gate International Exposition . <P> His stunt started off hell-for-leather . Last week it was spavined , string-halted , wind-broken . Eleven of the twelve riders who finished had nothing but saddle galls to show for their trouble , were trying to rake up enough hay money to get back to North Texas , where they hoped to see Mr. Parton face to face . But Promoter Parton was missing . <P> From up- &-coming; Nocona 18 riders set out in March with a rousing send-off in their ears , behind them a caravan of trucks and trailers for spare horses , sedans for the judges and Promoter Parton . Eighteen miles out , the lone woman in the race was disqualified when a judge caught her riding in a truck while her horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got tough , five other riders dropped out . Nevertheless , Promoter Parton and his pals had a rare outing , a lot of it in wayside saloons . But as the California line neared they began to drop out . With them disappeared Parton and the plans for a big welcome in San Francisco . <P> Slim , weatherbeaten Shannon Davidson was the first rider to reach San Francisco . At a pipsqueak reception on Treasure Island he collected the only prize , $750 , and headed for home . Day or two later other contestants began to clatter in . One ranch hand , lost , tethered his horse in front of the San Francisco Stock Exchange . All were stony broke . <P> Last week , a solitary horseman buckety-bucked across the bridge to Treasure Island into the Fair grounds . V. H. Henderson had followed the race route , scrupulously refrained from changing horses until he had ridden 25 miles-consequently had won the booby prize ( honorary ) hands down . Seeing nothing funny in his place or predicament , Horseman Henderson angrily announced he would sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a way to get home .
