txt ADOLT HITLER , if he does Berlin get to be German ChancelLionlor , will be like the man Taming. who married for money : he will have earned it . He is being subjected by President HINDENBURG to an ordeal which must be more than painful .. The old Field Marshal has never : made a secret of the fact that all his policies in the last six months have been directed to the taming of HITLER . The world is now privileged to look in on the process in full swing . The man who started out two years ago by announcing himself as Germany 's master in the immediate future is now offered a share in the Government under restrictions that have never been imposed on a wouldbe Prime Minister . He may be the head of the government , provided he makes no change in the existing foreign policy , or internal administration , or military affairs , or social policy , or economic policy , or constitutional policy . HITLER would be permitted to seize this German scheme of things entire , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his heart 's desire . It is as if Juiaus CAESAR ended up by requesting permission to cross the Rubicon , or Louis XIV declaring that if no one had any objections he was the State , or Monte Cristo announcing that , subject to existing claims and liens , the world was his . ALFRED E. SMITH is to Not lead a Town Hall audience Letter in community singing next Perfect . week . Our news story yesterday remarked that he will be spared the need of elaborate rehearsals . The piece with which he will make his debut is " The Sidewalks of New York . " The reporter ventured the opinion that the song must come to Mr. Sum &; in his dreams . This may very well be , but it is not stated whether it comes to him like a message from Elfland or like a nightmare . There must have been inights toward the end of the recent campaign when AL woke up in a I cold sweat from dreams of the grass growing on the sidewalks of New York . But that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more probI able than the guess that Mr. SMITH hates the piece it is the suspicion that he does not know the words . A very safe wager would be that if he makes no attempt to refresh his memory before next Tuesday he will break down in the middle of the second line of " The Sidewalks of New York , " just like a President of the United States singing " The StarSpangled Banner " or King GEORGE singing " God Save the King . " In Moscow , writes Mr. Moscow DueANTy , there is one Fears menace which is feared Triumph , above all others , and . it is the outbreak of a revolution in Germany or elsewhere in Europe . This is a far cry from the time when LENIN staged the Bolshevist revolution in Russia , not because he was interested in Russia i but because he wished to set Western Europe on fire . Today STALIN does not want to set anything on fire . He wants to be let alone to build socialism in Russia . He is Iafraid of revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A German revolution is sure to be followed by a Fascist counter-revolution , and in the swing-back Russia is likely to be swept along with the rest . But if Mr. DURANTY correctly represents the state of mind in the Kremlin , there is one way in which STALIN can stave off the menace of a German revolution . He probably has some influence with the German Communist party . All he need db is to suggest to Comrade THAELMANN that the Communists , with 100 members in the Reichstag , join with 120 Socialists and 100 Centrists and Democrats to form a parliamentary , anti-Fascist government . Such a coalition would have a majority of sixty . TROTSKY , who is now on the outskirts of Germany , has been arguing for some time that Communists should combine with others to fight the Fascist danger . The ancient tradition that Chaco Latin-American armies conCannon sist almost entirely of MaFodder. jor Generals is shattered by the Bolivian casualty lists published . by the victorious Paraguayans . Among 6,000 Bolivian dead  --  the ratio of 6,000 dead to only 1,500 wounded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news  --  no officer above a Lieutenant Colonel is mentioned and the total of all commissioned officers is only a couple of hundred . It would have been a less depressing story if the armies on both sides did consist mostly of Generals . A General may be supposed to have at least a glimmer of an idea of what the fighting is about . But no such knowledge is to be expected of the poor devils of peons , Bolivians and Paraguayans , who have been slaughtering er -h other by the thousands in the mud and reek of the Chaco jungle . Colombia and Peru have been for months in a virtual state of war over their national honor and vital interests in the region of Leticia . The opening of hostilities waits only for reliable news of where Leticia. is and how one gets there . Speaker GARNER met Governor ROOSEVELT before the White House conference yesterday . It seems that under the new dispensation not even the Vice President of the United States can qualify as the Forgotten Man . The Tokyo General Staff has been advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any lingering doubt that Manchukuo was created by a spontaneous uprising of the Chinese inhabitants . " CURRY and . McCoosz Reported as Yielding . " They have had a good deal of experience in that field re-cently ,
