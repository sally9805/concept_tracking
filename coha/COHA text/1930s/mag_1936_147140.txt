Last week Philadelphia 's Curtis Publishing Co. totted up circulation and revenue for the first six months of 1936 . When the audit was completed , President Walter Dean Fuller announced that , between them , The Saturday Evening Post , Country Gentleman and Ladies ' Home Journal had gained some 418,000 readers over the first half of last year . Circulation : Sateve-post : 2,972,026 ; Country Gentleman : 1,534,812 ; Ladies ' Home Journal : 2,786,219 . Net profits of the three magazines for the same period were up from $3,773,297 to $4,107,871 . Curtis no-par common stock paid 60 a share , as against last year 's 42 . <P> Such good news for Curtis shareholders was slightly soured by Mr. Fuller 's calculation that each share of the $7 preferred stock had paid 23% of its earnings in taxes , leaving a dividend of only $4.75 for the investor . Recapitulating , Mr. Fuller also gave it as his gloomy opinion that " Federal , State and local taxes will increase this percentage in the future . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
