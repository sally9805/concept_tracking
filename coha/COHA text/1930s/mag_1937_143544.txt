November newspaper advertising sagged 9.3% under 1936 , but most publishers will be unable to reduce material and labor costs because newsprint jumps $7.50 a ton January 1 and Guild organization has turned the trend of editorial salaries upward. * But last week American Newspaper Publishers Association President James Geddes Stahlman showed his fellow members how economies can be made . His Nashville Banner has long been published each evening and Sunday . But lately it has been losing advertising to the Tennessean-in receivership for four years before Silliman Evans bought it last March-published each morning , evening and Sunday . To end a ruinous circulation and advertising fight between their rival papers , Mr. Evans , also chairman of Maryland Casualty Co. , and Mr. Stahlman have formed Newspaper Printing Corp . which will solicit advertising , print and distribute both papers from a new $150,000 building . Each paper owns half the stock in the operating company , of which Mr. Stahlman is chairman , Mr. Evans president . Competition ceases , for the Tennessean has dropped its evening paper , the Banner its Sunday paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step farther the plan used by Publisher Roy Howard in co-operation with Scripps-Howard 's Albuquerque and El Paso competitors , insists that national advertisers must use space in both the Banner and Tennessean . <P> Miami has also witnessed judicious pruning . Two months ago it had three dailies . John S. Knight of the Akron Beacon-Journal bought Frank B. Shutts 's Herald , then decided there was room for only the Herald and James M. Cox 's News to operate at a profit under present rising costs . Fortnight ago , like a move in a game of Monopoly , Mr. Knight gave Moses L. Annenberg , publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer , the Massillon , Ohio Independent as part-payment for Mr. Annenberg 's three-year-old tabloid Miami Tribune . Mr. Knight killed the growing Tribune , moved the Herald into Miami 's youngest newspaper plant , the $300,000 building departing Mr. Annenberg had just put up . <P> <P> *Great Northern , U. S. mill supplying less than 6% of the annual tonnage , will sell at $48 for the first six months of 1938.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
