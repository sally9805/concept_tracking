txt Mr. NEWTON D. BAKER 'S address at Yale Monday night was not reported in full . The published extracts from it , while highly interesting and indicative of his independent habit of thought , can not be fairly judged in the absence of the whole text . Referring to the opposition of Congress or one branch of it to the President , he is reported to have said : We must change our political system in the United States . We can not go on this way with a war between every President and Congress . " Every " seems a rather strong word . A certain amount of friction between the President and Congress , even of his own party , is inevitable . Election of an Opposition majority in the House in the mid-year of a Presidential term is common enough . In spite of manifestations of extreme partisanship , such as the course of the Whig Senators toward JACKSON , VAN BUREN , TYLER , or of the Republicans of both branches against Mr. WILSON in the closing years of his Administration , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislative was waged by Republican Congresses on ANDREW JOHNSON . The judgment of history on that is now practically unanimous . A lot of insane legislation was the result , some of it singularly slow to be repealed . The country has managed to go on its way in spite of all these political flare-ups . They are inevitable in our polity , which has often been attacked as dividing power and confusing responsibility . Mr. BAKER says : Our democracy must be reorganized so that we can get a responsible parliamentary majority in Washington . He seems to mean a parliamentary majority that will cooperate with the President . Well , there will be on and after March 4 next . Or , by reorganization of democracy , does he mean that Congress should be supreme , as Parliament is supreme , and government by a committee take the place of the present system ? No , he can not mean that , for in England Governments without a majority of members of the House of Commons have not been unusual ; and Mr. RAMSAY MACDONALD is no stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The multiplication of parties and group Governments on the Continent is almost too familiar to mention . Blocs have been a curse of Congress for some years . As there is no means of guaranteeing a parliamentary majority under a parliamentary Government , what method would Mr. BAKER advocate for the purpose of securing " a responsible parliamentary majority , " cooperating with and not hostile to the President ? Only the accident of a landslide can carry Senate as well as House . Even if the President 's term were lengthened to , say , six years and the terms of Senators and Representatives made coterminous with his , there could be no assurance of a responsible majority if Senators were still elected by the people of the several States and Representatives by the people of the several districts ; and even if assured , it might melt away . Doubtless complete publication of Mr. BAKER 'S speech will end the puzzlement in which its , disject members leave us.                    @
