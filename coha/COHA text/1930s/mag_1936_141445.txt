By the time he reached Des Moines for his meeting with Alf Landon ( see col. 3 ) , President Roosevelt had seen the worst of the Drought . Rolling East next day into the mild Drought belt , he stopped at Hannibal , Mo . to help dedicate a Mark Twain Memorial bridge across the Mississippi . At Springfield , Ill. for Drought talks with Illinois officials , a telephone talk with Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau gave him occasion to declare : " The obligations of the Government-of the United States-are on a sounder basis of credit than ever before in history . " <P> Proceeding to Indianapolis , the President spent two hours motoring over the city to look at WPA projects and visit the State Fair , three hours at the Indianapolis Athletic Club for luncheon and a Drought conference with the Governors and Senators of Indiana , Ohio , Kentucky and Michigan . The fact that he did not get the GOPresidential nomination enabled Michigan 's Senator Vandenberg to be less circumspect than Alf Landon had been at Des Moines . Before entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dry in Michigan , but we only knew casually it was a Drought until this trip . " Emerging , he reported on results : " We accomplished a mutual exchange of congenialities . " Heading for Nebraska , the Michigan Senator was primed to speak on the following topic : " If the Drought is a calamity , what is Secretary Wallace ? " <P> From Indianapolis , the President sped back to Washington , there sped to a White House microphone to report to the nation on his tour . Studiously pedestrian in its " nonpolitical " approach to Drought , Franklin Roosevelt 's first fireside talk of 1936 took on some of the verve of his previous radio heart-to-hearts when he turned to re-employment and his favorite theme of economic freedom . Said he : " My friends ! * I have been on a journey of husbandry . . . . I saw drought devastation in nine states . I talked with families who had lost their wheat crop , lost their corn crop , lost their livestock , lost the water in their well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer without one dollar of cash resources , facing the winter without feed or food-facing a planting season without seed to put in the ground . . . . <P> " Yet I would not have you think for a single minute that there is permanent disaster in these Drought regions , or that the picture I saw meant depopulating these areas . No cracked earth , no blistering sun , no burning wind , no grasshoppers are a permanent match for the indomitable American farmers and stockmen and their wives and children . . . . <P> " We have the option , in the case of families who need actual subsistence , of putting them on the dole or putting them to work . They do not want to go on the dole , and they are 1,000 per cent right . We agree , therefore , that we must put them to work-work for a decent wage . . . . <P> " We face the question of what kind of work they ought to do . ... Thousands of ponds or small reservoirs have been built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or deepened ; community lakes have been created and irrigation projects are being pushed . ... In the Middle West . . . work projects run more to soil-erosion control and the building of farm-to-market roads .
