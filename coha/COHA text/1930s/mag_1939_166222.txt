Oetje ( pronounced eachie ) John Rogge was a Harvard Law School classmate of Tommy Corcoran , currently has the juicy job of handling SEC 's attack on Transamerica Corp. , the $138,000,000 bank holding company accused of registering " false and misleading statements . " <P> Transamerica 's boss , old Amadeo Peter Giannini , having retorted that it was simply a matter of accounting theory , began fighting SEC with all the wrath his hot Italian blood could generate . In Washington last week , after a month of legal fencing , Lawyer Rogge haled Mr. Giannini 's personal secretary to court . She refused to talk . So did three other Giannini intimates . " This is the most outrageous case of contumacy I have ever seen , " bellowed Lawyer Rogge , obtaining a recess until March 20 . <P> Hustling home to San Francisco , old A. P. immediately took his battle to the public . Snapped this onetime backer of the New Deal : " I found bright young men , fresh from academic halls , completely uninformed of life and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By using the force of propaganda they try to compensate . . . . " <P> Thereupon Banker Giannini himself took a bold propagandistic step . To squelch SEC charges that he took more money from his empire than he admitted , A. P. ( who has lately been closeted with cunning Pressagent Edward L. Bernays ) released a complete statement of his net worth , including cash , securities , salary , insurance . Instead of the millions most people would have guessed , it totaled only $407,798.46.
