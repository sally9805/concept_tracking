I nest force myself to think back to that I his ? back to yesterday ? so I ha t I may begin at , the beginning and remember clearly and distinctly how all this began . ' We were at Sities then , my husband and 1 , at peace on its white curved beach , twenty-four hours ago . We had been there for t WO weeks , coming back to Barcelona on Sat ardays to see the baby , left behind with Ani , and to go to the Sunday bullfights . Yesterday then , al noon , we went back to our pension , to dress and pack and take the train for Barcelona . They had announced that morning , over the radio , that there had been an uprising of the troops in ' Melilla . Nothing more . The announcement did not worry us . It worried no one . Alelilla must be in Africa ? and Africa is very far away . We reached Barcelona in time for lunch . The afternoon we spent shopping for things we wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day was unbearably hot , and the Plaza Cataluna somnolent and lazy in the sun . People moved slowly across the Plaza , among the fountains and the fluttering pigeons and the babies playing in the graveled paths . Opposite the Ilotcl ( ' olon , workmen were affixing an enormous poster ? Week . ' That night . we went to the movies ? Rose uric . The theatre was stifling , and when we carne out we stopped at a cafe on the Paseo de Gracia for a glass of beer . It was half-past one , and the aspect , of the darkened streets was no different than usual . Scattered groups of people going home from the movies or the theatre ? little knots of two or three saying good-night at apart men 1-house doors  --  an occasional cruising taxicab moving noiselessly along the Paseo ? the people in the cafe sitting relaxed and comfortable , their conversation casual and light . Barcelona as usual , serene and peaceful beneath a small , high-riding moon . am awakened at five in the morning by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flood of sound through my open window and assails me on my bed . I run to the Window and lean out head and shoulders . Calle Lauria stretches below , five stories down , tranquil and motionless , empty of any human being . The shops are all closed , the shutters on every window , as far as 1 can see , monotonously closed and barred . And yet from all around me , from the street below , from beneath the trees , from the roofs and neighboring windows , the metallic crackling and spitting continue . Try as I will , leaning from the window , I can not see the source , and content myself with the only explanation that occurs to me . The booming and sputtering that I hear all over Barcelona are fireworks , and to-day must be another big fiesta ? we have had so many lately . Only ( and very , very gradually this strikes me as being strange ) it is curious that there is no one in the streets . No one on the roofs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the windows leaning out to listen and to see . I alone in all the long stretch of Celle Lauria hear the fireworks and lean from my window to watch and listen . For perhaps twenty minutes stay there ( an inexplicably unnoticed target , as I know now ) and only very gradually do 1 find it strange that , no one else cares enough about the fiesta to look out on it as I am doing . And all this time , beneath me , above me , closing in on every side , the spitting and crackling grow louder and louder . The first . sign of life is a private car coming rapidly up Celle Letitia . As it passes under my window I notice with surprise that from each of the two rear windows a rifle projects , its black snout pointing upwards . 1 run out through the living room to the roof terrace , leaving open behind me the French doors , to watch better the progress of this car . It stops in the next . block , in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gel out hurriedly , grasp the rifles in liring position , and station thernselve behind a tree . At the same moment I see other Assault Guards running , rifles in their hands , down the Diagonal , another block away . They pass in a continuous stream , two or three hundred of them . Then they are gone and the Diagonal is sunlit emptiness again . I look down Calle Lauria . Four mules dragging an empty and clattering gun carriage are plunging clown the street . Behind them gallop four saddled but riderless horses , the stirrups hounding against their haltered sides . At the Carmelite Church a Civil Guard stops out and halts the mules . He is aided by a group of soldiers who emerge like unexpected apparitions from beneath the trees . The four horses come to a heaving , trembling stop . There is a crackle , and a puff of smoke , from the tower of the Carmelite Church . In the street below an Assault Guard , sheltered behind a tree bole , raises his rifle and fires . know now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is war . The rockets and crackers I have been hearing are the grim fireworks of destruction . I run to my husband 's room . ' Tim ) , Tino , wake up ! There is shooting all over Barcelona . Something is happening . Wake up ! ' He springs disheveled from bed and joins me at the window . But his comprehension is quicker than mine . Are you crazy ? ' he says . ' Get back into the room . Call And We must try and close the windows and the shutters . ' Ani appears in the kitchen doorway , pale and trembling . It 's begun , ' she announces &intuit; irally . ' They ' re liring on the house . We shall all be killed . ' And she bursts into hysterical tears . Crouching , with our heads beneath t he level of the window sills , We st to swing shut the heavy wooden Hinds and close and liar the windows . The rooms are plunged at once into a thick obscurity , a twilight Whiell the growing noise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shutters we can look out on the Carmelite . Church and Calle Laurin . Beneath the church there is an assembling of Assault and Civil Guards . They are joined by soldiers , reeeive hurried orders , and disappear to take up stations in sheltered spots near by . Now again there are no human beings visible in the streets . Only , from time to time a puff of smoke rises from beneath a tree , and a minute later we hear the sharp ping of a revolver or the crack of a rifle . They are evidently attacking the church . From the narrow pointed windows of the Campanile puffs of smoke issue whitely and float lazily away on the still air . Occasionally we sec the dark gleam of a rifle barrel hurriedly thrust from one of I he openings and as hurriedly withdrawn . We do not understand what . is happening . There is no doubt that there is revolution . 13ut who is revolting against whom ? We can not tell . By now it seems as though they were all firing against each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , Civil Guards , assault Guards , firing , charging their rifles , firing again . At whom ? : 1. t each other : Or at the unknown , mysterious occupants of t he Church of the Carmelites ? We only know that ITOl itself has opened in the streets beneath our windows . The noise of the guns , the bombs , the grenades , is deafening . And in the tiny lulls between one discharge and another we hear the same cacophonic echo sounding distantly from every other part of Barcelona . Occasionally the wIt .. le is blotted out in the long , hoarse roar of the cannon . 11.30 A. M. ? The firing is still continuous , and we have given up our observation post , behind the closed shutters . Whistling bullets have told us it is dangerous to approach the windows . We try to sit down , to talk , but constantly one or the other of us gets up to go to the window again . We have got out the field glasses , and through the cracks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the kitchen preparing dinner . She is still frightened and sobbing from time to Lime . She has helped us move t he baby 's bed into Tino 's room , away from the direct line of fire . We have put the baby to bed . It is not safe to let her stay in the living room . She is fascinated by the closed shutters and tries to play with them , moving the slats back and forth with her finger . And a movement of the shut-tors now is an invitation to a bullet . Outside , in the hallway , clustered around the well of the stairs and elevator shaft , half of the terrified members of the apartment house are gathered . Many of them we have never seen before . But now we all greet each other with nervous recognition . Some of the women are sobbing . Sefior Bartoli , of the floor below , is afraid for his art . collection , should the house be bombed . He is of the opinion that t he men should try to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists . We can leave the women . But if they break in they will shoot the men . We must get away . ' No one listens to him . It is impossible to escape anyway . From below we can hear someone banging on the door . Open ! Open ! ' Salvador , the porter , hurries up the stairs , white and trembling . I wo n't open , ' he tells us . ' I 'll open to no one . Not until they force the door . ' No one knows what is really happening . We imagine that the troops have revolted . But if there are troops concealed in the Carmelite Church there are certainly other troops firing on them fl ? 0111 the street . The army must be divided . Some of it , anyway , must be loyal . It is surprising that the Civil Guards are against the soldiers . Their sympathies have never been with the popular government .. It is impossible to understand . Everyone is trying to make provision for food . Impossible to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window on the second floor we can lower a basket with a cord . The cord is just long enough to reach the back window of the grocery . There is no bread , no milk , no eggs , no ice . We buy what we can . No one knows how many days this will last ? how long it will be before we can venture out into the streets . We buy canned goods : sardines , tuna fish , tinned peaches , cheese . And candles . The lights may he cut off at any time . We have already filled the bathtub and all available jars with water . They say that in Madrid the water supply has already been cut off . Something has happened to the telephones . Ours is the only one in the building which is still working . And many of the numbers that we try to call are dead . We wander back and forth , restless , uncertain What to do . In the streets the uproar is continuous ? but more intense now , louder , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time has stopped . Tino is still puttering with the radio , trying to repair a broken part . Ani , sobbing , clatters dishes in the kitchen . In her bed the baby chortles with delight , and plays with her blue gingham cat . 2 P. NI . ? We are in the midst of the fiercest battle of the day . From all over Barcelona come the crash and boom of rifles , bombs , and cannon . There are shouts now from the street , but we do not dare look out . The bullets are whistling too close to our windows . Open . . . firer Volleys of rifle shot , and screams . Hands . . up ! ' A pistol cracks , and a groan is choked off suddenly . Gingerly we peer through the shutters . In the tower of the church they have stationed machine guns . From time to time the air is torn with their sharp pion-punt-paw . Suddenly the drone of an airplane motor is heard directly above our heads . In a minute the plane itself dips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the Carmelite Church . There is the sharp rattle of machine guns from the plane . They are firing at random on the streets and houses below . Cars pass occasionally now in the street . Camions , for the most part , and private cars that have evidently been requisitioned . In an open truck that traverses Calle Provenza at high speed are five young boys crouched on the floor and firing rifles . Against a. buttress of mattresses at the rear of the truck a machine gun is placed . But it is not being fired . The figure of a boy lies slumped and motionless on the floor beside it . It is singular that there are no animals in the streets . Not a dog or cat ventures out into the sunny morning . But screaming all around our windows are birds ? in panic-stricken , headlong flight . Their cries and agonized flutterings make a continual accompaniment to the guns that roar below . On the roof opposite curs three Assault Guards appear , and take up their stations behind three projecting bits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful aim with their rifles , fire into the street below , and withdraw . They are there for perhaps half an hour , leaning out , aiming , firing , and withdrawing . Then we do not see them any more . Cars are passing more frequently in the streets ? beautiful cars , luxurious limousines and open sport models , polished and shining ? the cars of the wealthy , filled now with men and soldiers in shirt sleeves , firing constantly us they careen Wildly through the streets . Many of the cars have the tops protected with mat tresses . All of them have letters painted on the sides ? letters in sprawling daubs , the white paint not yet dry . FAI the cars say ( those are t he letters of t he Anarchist s ) , CNT ( the workers ' organization ) , and FAT again . In an open , shining Mercedes-Benz , a. young girl works side by side with the men , tending a machine gun . As the car whirls around the corner she laughs , raising her clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere cries Fira Republica ! ' It is answered by another voice . Abajo la Republica ! ' ( Down with the Republic ! ' ) Espaher The firing breaks out again , fiercer and harsher than before . Once more the airplane clips above the church , closer this time . We can see the men inside . One of them feeds a machine gun , and the rain of the bullets showers down into the streets below . The pilot leans out to look , before the plane soars up again , and raises his fist for a moment . We try to sit clown and eat our lunch . But it is impossible . Am has just brought the roast to the table when there is a deafening crash outside . We run to the windows to look through the slats of the shutters . A closed car , riddled with bullets , has just smashed against a tree on our corner . It smokes for a moment as though it would burst into flame , then the smoke drifts away and we are aware of what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its occupants , a wounded Assault Guard . his waist and loins are in a pool of blood . Lying backwards across the radiator of the car is : mother guard , one hand clutching his throat , his head hanging clown against the fender . Ile is silent , but the man on the pavement is groaning and calling aloud . I am dying . I am dying ! Open the doors ! Take me in ! Call an ambulance . i run dying . For the love of God , open the doors ! ' 1311i all down the street the doors and windows remain I ight shut . It is certain death to emerge into the streets , even to save the wounded . There is another now . Two doors clown , in Calle Provenza , a young boy has dragged himself to one of the closed doors and is pounding against it with his fists . Let me in ! Let me in ! Help ! Open the door ! ' it is more than AVO can bear . In a tragic chorus now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sobs of the wounded and I be dying . Tino goes to the telephone and tries in vain to call an ambulance . He dials several hospitals , the Red Cross , the firemen . The answer is everywhere the same : the ambulances are all out ; they will send one when they can , but there are none available 1101V . I look once more from the window . A priest runs out into the street in an effort to save the young boy huddled against the door . But the firing is at once directed upon the priest , and he is forced to disappear and give up his effort . Across the way the guard on the motor of the smashed car has ceased to move . His hand has fallen down from his throat and lies limp and nerveless against one of the shattered headlights . But the other guard still writhes on the sidewalk , still calls mu in accents that make my eyes smart with tears of pity : ' I am dying ! 11 am dying ! For the love of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by little , almost as though it were not really happening at all , the door of the little bread shop on the corner swings ajar . Miraculously , unscathed in a hail of bullets , the baker and his wife s ! ip through the opening and in a low gliding crawl reach the wounded guard . Iletween t hem they lift him up and half drag , half carry him into the bakery . The door , pierced with bullets , swings to again behind them . Where the guard has lain a puddle of blood darkens the sidewalk . Near it lies a magnificent pistol , out of its holster , gleaming and abandoned on the sidewalk , where it has slipped from the relaxed fingers of the dying guard . A boy of sixteen or seventeen slips out from nowhere and runs toward the pistol to seize it for his own . He is assailed by a volley of shot , and falls face down within a few feet of the pistol . He does not move again . The screams are fewer now . Even our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut them out . At last an ambulance arrives . Two men in the uniform of the Red Cross , carrying a stretcher , dismount . They make several trips , up and down the street , putting body after body into the tiny ambulance . We hear one of them say : No , not that one . He 's dead . Leave him for later . ' Lastly they go into the bakery and come out carrying the wounded guard . He is silent now , and lies beneath a blanket on the stretcher . The blanket is already drenched with blood . The Red Cross men push him hastily into the ambulance , climb up into the driver 's seat , and drive away . A DIARY OE REVOLUTION 5 1 9 The firing continues . We no longer approach the windows , but we know ; hat many men are being killed in the street below . We can hear the voices : Hands up ! ' Open fire ! ' We hear the staccato reports of the machine guns in the tower of the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there are groans , and silence - and more shots and groans and silence . More and more frequently the sirens of the ambulances sound , and there is a little lull while the dying are gathered up and taken away . Then shots , and cries , and shots again . The afternoon wears on , interminable . 6.301 ' . ? lictweeu 4.30 and 6 P. At . we have had a period of compitraf ive calm . There is no more firing from the church . On a roof somewhere near our own ( possibly it is our own ) we hear at irregular intervals the sharp report of a pistol . Always this is answered by a round of firing from the street . Then the pistol is silent , to begin again , fifteen or twenty minutes later , mocking , reiterant , teasing the rifles of the guards below . We have made several trips downstairs to listen to the radio of Sefior Bartoli or of the porter ? . Around every radio in the house there is a constant group of excited people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know now that the military have uprisen all over Spain , but the trend of the battle is still unascertained . There is almost no information , but it is obvious that things are serious indeed . They announce that all pharmacies will remain open night and day , to care for the wounded . There has been an appeal for volunteers for blood transfusions . Several of the occupants of the apartment house have come up to use our telephone . They call friends here and there , in different parts of the city . Most of the numbers called do not respond ; the A ires are down . But occasionally is call gets through . They say that the Illasa Cataluna is almost completely destroyed . The Hotel Colon is the headquart ers of the insurgents , Who have also taken over the building of the Telephone Company . But in Calls Aluntimr , on the other hand , nothing has happened . They can hear the firing from other parts of the city , but that is all . They are beginning to burn the churches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see the fires . Everyone is nervous , excited . But there is nothing to do . Even hysteria is dying down . The electricity and water are still functioning , although the gas is bad  --  it takes over an hour to heat a tiny pot of water on the stove . It will go out altogether soon , we suppose . 7 P. M. ? During the last hour 's lull in the firing , several people have appeared in the streets . Alen , for the most part , walking slowly with an apprehensive eye direct ell to the closed windows about them , to the street intersections , and to the convent on the corner above . A few of the street doors have been opened , and the shopkeepers and occupants of the houses stand hesit achy on the thresholds , grateful for a breath of air . They all hold an unfolded white handkerchief in one hand , as a sign of innocent intentions . At half-past six see go out on to the terrace . But things arc not yet really calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street is stopped by a sharp cry of ' Hands up ! Get . back there ! ' His hands raised above his head , he darts back to the protection of an open door . There is no shot ; but he does not venture out again . A moment later four young people come slowly down Calle Lauria in the direction of the church . One is a young man who carries a fluttering white handkerchief in his hand . Three girls Walk beside him , their hands loosely linked together . As they reach the corner a voice from somewhere cries , ' Hands up ! ' Startled , the three hesitate , then put up their arms and turn to stele safety . In the moment of their turning a series of shots is emptied into their group . ( Inc of the girls she is dressed in white and wears the Red Cross on her sleeve ) falls screamMg to t he gelnind . Immediately the street is filled with firing again . Doors bang shut and , as by magic , people disappear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the girls by the waist and is edging down into Calle Provenza with her , bit by bit , taking shelter in one arched doorway y titer another . But the girl in white lies where she was shot clown in 1 he street . We have run back into the house and shut the windows at the first sound of renewed firing but we can see her through the slats of the shutters . The shoulder and the skirt of her dress are stained with blood . One of her friends has stayed with her and stoops now , crouched above her , in the middle of a rain of bullets , sheltering the stricken body in her arms . The firing continues and the friend , panic-stricken , drags her painfully along the sidewalk , seeking safety . Three young men emerge suddenly into the 81 reel , bend and pick up the wounded girl , and carry her to a door which is quickly opened to let them in and closed behind them . They pass unscathed through t he firing , hut twenty minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guns are waiting for them . Two fall in front of the very doorway , one dead , one wounded . Even acts of rescue are not tolerated to-day in Spain . It is getting too dark to sec the streets now . A few moments ago four old people passed , terrorized spectres in black , carrying bundles and bags , evidently trying to escape from the harassed city . As they passed out of sight beneath our windows they were fired on , too . We did not sec them fall . Perhaps they escaped unhurt . We try to believe that . 10 P. M. We have just been up on the roof . Eight or nine of us , with the portcro , unlocked the door and stole up in the darkness to look out on Barcelona by night . The firing has almost died down again , but there are scattered shots from time to time , and if we W ere seen on the roof we should be fired at . The night air is very cold , and we shiver a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , among the darkened buildings of the city , rises a column of white , heavy smoke . They are burning the churches . Off to the right , and elevated on a little hill , one church stands up like liquid gold against the night . It must be honeycombed with fire inside , but the walls rise up translucent and golden with the flames , each tiny pinnacle and turret bright against the sky . Midnight . ? We went to bed at eleven-thirty , undressing without lights and moving silently . Shortly afterward we heard the changing of the guard beneath our window . They talked a long time in the street , giving and receiving advice . Then the old guard went away . Almost immediately-there was a volley of furious shooting , and for half an hour the street was loud again with shots and cries . The street lights were shot out almost at once . When there was no more shooting there were the groans of the wounded , and through the shutters we could dist inguish several bodies lying motionless or writhing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A DIARY OF REVOLUTION began , and after a while all was quiet . once more . We shall go back to bed and try to sleep . Monday , July 20 , 9 A. M. ? We are awakened at eight o'clock by firing again . The shooting is sharp and violent , but stops in half an hour , and there is another period of calm . Salvador knocks at our door to tell us to open the shutters and the windows . They have announced over the radio that all windows must be open . Closed shutters will be instantly fired at . We open the windows , swinging back and fastening the heavy shutters . We can still hear shooting in distant parts of Barcelona , but our own quarter seems to have quieted down . 1Q.30 P. m. ? The early morning quiet was the lull before the storm . Between nine and eleven we experienced the heaviest firing we have yet undergone . It began from the church tower of the Carmelites , where the insurgents are still strong . They have trained machine guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , Calle Rosellon , and the Diagonal . There is an answering fire in every direction ? from the streets , from the houses , from the roofs . The airplanes are out again , flying high and circling down above the church tower , machine-gunning the buildings and the streets . The fire is incessant . The forces in the church have been increased somehow during the night , and certainly they have more arms and ammunition . But at eleven o'clock the firing stops . There is a great assemblage of Civil and Assault Guards in the street beside the church . In Calle Bruch the mob has brought up a cannon and trained it against the tower of the church . If the insurgents have no more ammunition , they must surrender now . Presently , in the top of the Campanile , the white flag is run up . Instantly the streets are filled with cheering mobs . The police are powerless to hold them back ; they surge against the church , shaking their fists , dancing with rage . ntny carry lighted torches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally a group of Assault Guards enter the church . In twenty minutes they come out aga in . Evidently the insurgents refuse to give themselves over to the Assault Guards , because their places in the church are taken by a group of Civil Guards , who in their turn are gone for ten or fifteen minutes . Meanwhile the mob of civilians in the street increases . There must be two or three thousand now , pressed close against the walls of the church , menacing and angry . Let the insurgents come out ! The Assault Guards have rot iced to a distance , and the Civil Guards are too few to restrain the mob . They succeed at last in clearing a little open space before the church doors . At eleven-thirty they begin taking out the wounded and the dead . The ambulances of the Red Cross have stopped several blocks away , unable io pass the civilian mob , and the stretcher bearers approach the church slowly , on foot , preceded by a uniformed officer with the Red Cross flag . The first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead officer . He is covered with a blanket , and we can not see his face as he is carried under our windows , but his rigid , stiffly shaken arms stick out from beneath the blanket , and we see the gilt stripes on the sleeve . The mob hails the corpse with applause . The stretcher bearers pass slowly to the distant ambulance , deposit their burden inside , and return to the church for the next . body . One after another they bring them out , the wounded and the dead . There is always applause for the dead , and blasphemy and shouts age in si those officers who are only wounded . One by one they carry them beneath r windows . ( n is delirious , and vt ' it he s hack and fon It on t he st ret cher , trying to get down , to fight again .

The stretchers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to cover them are stained with red .

Against the common soldiers the mob hears no malice ; they are released al . mice and even aided to t bii r hon-nts ? they were forced to fight , ; old only acted tinder orders . But , against the priests and oilicers the hatred of the people is implacable . ' linty spit on the dead officers , and snatch the stretchers from under the wounded . One stretcher , tossed aside to a corner of the street , is seized by five or six civilians , in turn , flung viciously into t he ; tit- , stamped upon , and finally smashed to kindling wood . At , last they bring out a wounded captain . The Civil Guards can not hold hack the mob . They press upon him , men and women , beating at him with ( heir fists , Hinging stones . It is useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , the stretcher hearers rush him into the corner pharmacy . The people assail the doors . They will break their way in to kill him if they can . The pharmacist , in his white apron , stands against the closed doorway . ' You can not kill a wounded man , ' he insists , again and again . There is the crash of shattered glass , cries and shoats , and the steady , pleading iteration of the pharmacist . ' This is a ( lying man ! ' he cries . ' You can not kill a dying man . Let him be ! ' At last the guards disperse the crowd . Suddenly , mica culottly , the mob is armed . Not a man who is not flourishing a pistol or a gun , or even a sharp kitchen knife . The guards are powerless to restrain the people now . They ; ire selling fire to the church , shatttting the windows With incendiary bombs , and flinging lighted torches into the dark interior .

Those who can , climb inside them , appropriating them for their own . Twenty or more have now been brought into the street. ; some of them are being used to carry home the wounded soldiers . The church is burning well now . The black smoke billows up in larger and larger clouds . Someone has pulled down the white flag in the tower and hoisted in its stead the red flag . The smoke and flames lick up toward it . But the mob does not withdraw . The people are Availing for something . All the soldiers and the officers have been taken out . But the mob is waiting  - -  because the priests remain . They must . still be in the church . The mob is waiting for the fire to drive them out . The first one escapes .

And now the other priests come out , one by enc . They are dressed in ordinary shirts and trousers , and keep their hands held high above their heads , asking for mercy . The first one are protected by the Civil Guards and disappear into side streets . Although the mob is restive and murmurs against them , it lets them pass . But now the humor changes . The Civil Guards are pushed aside , and the mob takes control . A machine gun is place ' Opposite the church door , and es the priest come out t hey are shot clown one by one against the wall . Across a bench , in the Diagonal , lies the crumpled body of another priest ? one of those the people had at first let pass . They must be all out now . The mob has begun to disperse .

They direct . him out into the wide stretch of the Diagonal , and make him set off down it , alone , under the arching branches of the trees . The priest walks slowly , with a staggering , uncertain gait . Lie is on the point of collapse , but when lie tries to Ivan against a wall to rest himself the people force him on .

They let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly ended . The radio reports are more frequent now . Everything is calm again , they announce . The rebels have all surrendered . With the capture of the Carmelite Church the revolt in Barcelona is ended . The rumors that private cars may not circulate freely in the streets are absolutely false . We can not too well credit these reports . Certainly the firing has considerably dimin:shed , but if we listen at all we can still hear it . now here , now there ; in one part of Barcelona or another , 1.1v , . iys there is tiring going on . In the early afternoon l'ino and I issued gingerly out of doors . We went to the grocery store next door to get a little tinned milk for the baby . Inside . an armed man was requisitioning food for 1:Ie Wounded . Ile was gaunt and haggard , with a two days ' growth of heard , and a ribbon of dried blood across his forehead .

There was , of course , no payment made , but the Mall was not unreasonable in his demands . When he had what he wanted he turned and went out , slinging the rifle carelessly across his shoulder . In spite of the null() announcement , the only cars circulating in the streets are those of the FA ' and the CNT . True , they are private cars , lint in the hands of the populace now . They are all marked with big initials , indicating the group winch is driving diem , and from their windows guns and revolvers are pointed at the houses . Many of the guns have bits of red cloth tied about the barrel . At three o'clock Salvador came to tell us it had been requested over the radio that all those loyal to the Republic should spread white sheets from their windows and balconies . Disloyal houses would lie fired upon . I unfold three sheets against the terrace railing , fastening them with safety pins . All up and down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flapping against the balconies and windows . At five o'clock the cars of the FAT and CNT begin to pause before the houses , ordering the sheets to be taken in . They may conceal snipers . There are still many untraced pistol shots , and the roofs and balconies are all suspect . I hurry upstairs , unpin the sheets , and put them away . We Vent um out once more , to the pharmacy . The pharmacist has not rested for more than thirty hours , and is groggy with sleep . lie tells us that the captain menaced by the mob escaped at last , in civilian clothes , through a back door . We go up once on to the roof , All Barcelona seems afire ; from nearly every block a billowing column of smoke rises thickly . But we are forced to abandon our post on the roof . An airplane swoops low above us , and we dodge in just in time to escape a little hail of bullets spattering on the tiles . We eat in the kitchen , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the street . When we cross I he front rooms we are careful not to show ourselves before the windows , and we reach the bedroom in a crouching glide across the floor , because there is still a sniper on one of the neighboring roofs ( perhaps our own ) , and his irregular shots are always answered by rifle fire from the streets below . Tuesday , Jule 91.  --  This has been a curious day . In Barcelona everything is apparent ly calm , although there was another sharp salvo of tiring at eight this morning . But the sensation of fear and panic , dulled during the excitement of the first two days , is stronger now . We know now that what has taken place in Barcelona is also taking place all over Spain . We have borrowed the radio from the apartment across the hail . Our neighbors are in the country for the summer , and Salvador let us have the key . Now we are in constant touch with the reports . Hundreds of cars are in the streets to-day ? all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them heavily protected with mattresses , and all of them with rifles , revolvers , and machine guns menacing the people . Most of the drivers are evidently having their first experience M a car . They careen by at a terrific pace , rounding corners on taco wheels , bumping over obstacles , applying screaming brakes . Sonic cars have ' Doctor ' painted on them , others carry the Red Cross , still others say Ambulance , ' Police , ' or Emergency . ' We go out to look at the smashed car across the way . It is riddled by more than thirty bullet holes , . and the interior is a mass of splintered fragments . The upholstery is torn to ribbons . On the pavement beside it the pool of blood has dried to a dull dark crust . There is not a house that has escaped the guns . In many cases the windows are shattered as high up as the fifth floor , and the stone walls are seared and furrowed with the marks of the bullets . The ironwork of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The few people passing in the streets are for the most part the workers , armed . There is no well-dressed person to be seen . The rich Who venture out have dressed themselves in the clothes of their servants , but by their walk and bearing they arc ridiculously obvious in their disguise . We attempt to get through to Calle Claris , the next street , where they say a cannon ball has ploughed through a bedroom wall . But ' halfway down the block we are stopped by a series of shots from the roofs above us . We plunge into the nearest doorway for shelter and wait there half an hour , along with a group of six or seven others , until the streets are calm again and we dare scurry home . The radio continues to issue warnings and reports . We can get Madrid now , although the programme is constantly interrupted by static improvised by the rebels . It is difficult to hear clearly . A speech is often cut short by mocking cries of Liar ! " Trickster ! " Liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the roofs ; not to believe the rebel radio reports from Seville ; not to show ourselves in the windows . There are repeated requests for volunteers for blood transfusions ; for volunteer nurses ; for volunteers to remote the stinking carcases of horses and mules from the streets . Sheets and towels are being requisitioned from private houses for the hospitals . The grocery stores are asked to surrender to any armed man whatever food he asks . The situation is in hand , the radio assures us again and again . The situation is calm , and completely in hand . The rebel radio from Seville asks us not to believe the reports from Madrid and Barcelona . The insurgents are gaining , they tell us ; do not believe Madrid and Barcelona . Barcelona says that everything is calm . And at five o'clock the air is rent again with the sound of firing , and we crouch beneath the open windows , listening to the battle which continues until dark . Then the noise of shooting slowly dies away . The radio says that everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mocking voice shrills out of the ether : Liar ! Liar ! ' Wednesday , July 22 , 9 P. at . ? We were awakened last night at one o'clock by the noise of quarreling in the street below . There was no shooting and we edged at last to the window to look out . A company of Civil Guards were lined up against the wall of the little movie theatre in Calle Lauria , and a group of a dozen or more other guards were accusing them of treachery . It was difficult to catch the words . Evidently the lined-up company had been missing during the battle , and had now been found by the others and were being questioned as to their activities . The accusations were loud and vigorous . ' Where have you been these three days : Why are you all so clean and well fed : . Have you been in hiding ' : ? And the accused replying : ' e are telling you the truth . We were surrounded . We could tit stir . For three days we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t light . ' The accusation : ? We order you to come at once to headquarters to be tried for treason . ' The accused : We refuse to go . We are innocent . We were surrounded , we tell you . We refuse to go unless a higher officer commands . ' And one voice suddenly , breaking into an hysterical whimper : For the love of the good God , believe us ! We are innocent . You ca n't kill us . We have been innocent . ' For two hours the quarrel went on : accusation and defense , defense and accusation ; an informal tribunal beneath our windows , the voices resonant and sharp in the night . Occasionally the frightened , sobbing whimper : ' I tell you we are innocent ! For the love of God , do n't shoot us ! ' At three o'clock a truck comes and takes the accused company away . We sleep again . The radio reports to-day have been more frequent , but still unsatisfactory . There are constant interruptions and blottings-out of the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurgents . The report that two regiments from there are marching on Barcelona is denied . But they say that six thousand men from Barcelona are setting out against Saragossa . There is still no milk , no eggs , no butter . The grocery stores are open , but their stock has been sadly depleted . Big trucks with ' Milk ' daubed on their sides pass through the streets from time to time , under armed escort , but they are going to the hospitals . We go out for a few minutes to look at the Carmelite Church . The interior is completely burned out now , although the walls still stand . We pause for a moment in the gaping doorway and look in . The heat is intense . From the great vault of the dome , bits of twisted ironwork and writhen window frames hang down . The floor is thick with feathery ashes and bits of broken , blackened glass . On the high altar and in one of the little chapels flames are still alight , licking up into the gloom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ell with chalk : ' Be careful . Danger of falling walls . There is still fire in the basement . ' All through the streets the smell of smoke is heavy and stifling . They say that every church in Barcelona is on fire . Occasionally there is a sharper , more pungent smell drifting With that of the smoke . In the Plaza Cataluna they are burning the bodies of the dead horses and the mules . We have tried for three days to send a telegram . Our families in Italy and in America must be desperate . To-day for the first time it was possible to get the cable office . To-morrow , they say , perhaps to-morrow the service will be resumed . Jt is not possible to wire to-day . All up and down the streets , according to the orders we have received , shutters and windows stand open . Here and there , on house doors , placards have been affixed . We read one or two of ( hens . ' The occupants of the fifth floor front are away for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have the keys . ' ' Third floor left is unoccupied . Do not fire . ' We do not stay long in the streets ; they are too dangerous . This morning two of the speeding cars crashed on our corner and rolled over and over in a metallic locked embrace . One dead , four wounded , and the siren of the ambulance again . This afternoon there were two more accidents on our corner . All over the city the same thing must be going on . ' Co-day for the first time we have had a newspaper . Only two sheets , poorly printed and almost without news . ' Order has been restored , ' it says . ' The insurgents have all surrendered and their general , Goded , is a prisoner . ' Follow partial lists of the identified dead and wounded . The percentage of women and children among them is amazingly high . To-night they have begun radio announcements in all languages . The German , Italian , French , American , and British consulates are broadcasting . They reiterate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no cause for alarm . Every half hour or so there is a new announcement . ' Attention . ' ' Attenzione . " Aeldung. xlcktung . ' To all British subjects in Spain . ' Notice to all American citizens . ' Lt P. ? The radio messages are growing more alarming in character . British subjects are told that they may leave if they so desire . A British warship is anchored in the harbor to receive them . Later still : ' All British subjects who can do so are advised to leave Spain at ( nice . Proceed on foot to the harbor , where His Majesty 's ship London is at anchor . Take with you only one suitcase , and food . Food ! ' And later still : ' All British subjects are urgently advised to have at once . ' There are evidently several boats in the harbor . The Italian Consulate announces that to-morrow a ship will arrive to take all foreigners , of whatsoever nationality , who wish to leave . The French have already been picked up by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship London . The American Consulate announces that arrangements are being made to he Americans on the Italian ship . Only when the messages grow urgent do We think of leaving . It seems ridiculous to go . We have been no comfortable , so peaceful here . What of our apartment , our clot he s , our possessions ? Ridiculous to be scared out now , when everything is over . Only ? if the , warnings continue to be more and inure urgent ? everything cannot. be over . There must be worse to come . Barcelona is in hand , it is true , but we know that Saragossa at least , has fallen to the insurgents . If they should . gain force to return and attack Barcelona . . . I telephone the house of the American C'onsul . ' Officially we can advise no one to leave . But if it is possible for you to do so , perhaps you had better go . Notify any Americans you know Mat the ' Italian ship will take them In the doorway of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city from the outlying district . of Ponanova . IIe says that the sacking and robbing of private homes there have begun . Within the city limits t he police protection is still strong , but outside already there can be no guarantee of surety . And everyone is armed . They have even opened the jails , released the prisoners , and given them guns . As we are making ready to go to bed we notice through the open window a. blinding light on the roof of an unfinished building down the street . We lean out to examine it . It is the new apartment house on Calle Laurin , in emergency use now as a hospital , and he light on the roof is the Bed Cross illuminated ? a warning for attacking planes . We decide to leave . I pack two suitcases . It does not take long . One for the baby and one for Tino and me . There is lilt lo enough that we can take : my jewelry , a change of underclothing , a dressing gown . How lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Thursday , July ? We have sent two telegrams to-day , one to Tino 's family in Italy , and one to mine in America . ' All safe . ' We do not say that We are trying to leave . IC by some chance we should not get away- . . . It is impossible to communicate by telephone with the American or the Lillian Consulate . The lines are up now , but are always busy . We go down to the Italian Consulate ourselves . Outside there is ri seething mob terrified Germans , cans , clustered anxiously about , waiting for information as to when they can sail . The civilian molt , heavily armed , moves back and forth before the doors , restless to ai tack this stronghold of the hated Fascism . Fifteen or twenty Assault Guards protect the Consulate . NVe pass sloWly through the crowd , raising our arms constantly in the salute of the Anarchists ? the clenched left fist . It is a gesture that . everyone must learn these days . From every car that passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal is not answered at once the car slows down , and guns and revolvers are pointed at the delinquent until he responds . The Consulate can tell us nothing definite . The boat is expected late in the afternoon . There Will be no provision for getting to the quay . Everyone must fend for himself . Take little or no luggage . Food Will be provided . No charge for transportation will be made . All foreigners who wish to go will be taken , provided that their passports are in order . 13ut my passport . is mit in order . It expired on the tent h of July , and I had not yet troubled to renew it . There is no help now . We must go down to the Plaza Cataluna , to the American Consulate . It is ordinarily not a long walk , but it takes us , more than an hour to-day . We go very slowly , Wary of the madly plunging cars along the streets , stopping When bidden to give the Anarchist salute . We keep close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , unprotected places . A stray shot may till the streets with firing at any time , and we must be ready to dodge into the nearest doorway . It is a little like the old children 's game of Going to Jerusalem . ' I am without a hat , and wearing a sleeveless cotton tennis dress . No woman in the whole city dares to go out with a hat on now . It is the symbol of wealth in Spain ? the sign and stamp of the hated aristocracy . The aspect . of the streets is indescribable . Everywhere telephone and trolley wires are down , many of them marked with bits of red cloth to indicate their danger . The streets are strewn with the lopped-off branches of trees , and in some places the fallen leaves are heaped knee-high . Here and there we see an entire tree trunk blasted by the force of a bomb . Even an iron lamp post has been sliced in two so that the top half lies flat on the pavement . There is not a house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facades are seared and furrowed with the traces of projectiles , the lower windows riddled with bullet holes or smashed to bits by some grenade . Against sonic of the walls and on the ground we can see the black stains of dried blood that has not yet been washed away . On our way we pass ten or fifteen churches and convents ; there is one on nearly every corner in this part of Barcelona . All of them , without exception , are in ruins . The blackened walls rise up in fragile majesty , mere empty shells of crumbling stone . Through the gaping doorways we can look into the charred interiors , where marble and gilt tracery alike have tumbled into sooty trash . In many places smoke still eddies fitfully and little flames spring up and die along the window ledges . The Ritz Hotel , scarred by the battle , bears a huge placard on one of its lower balconies : ' Emergency Blood Hospital . ' Garbage is burning in the streets . There has , of course , been no collection of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiff of burnt hair and flesh ? the horses and the mules again . The American Consulate is on the other side of the Plaza Ca.taluila . As we start to cross the square a shot sounds from a near-by roof , and all the passers in the street stop short , frozen to immobility . A moment later there is another shot , from nearer by , and the frozen people dissolve into motion and dart into the doorways for cover . When things seem calm we venture on , but not across the Plaza this time . We skirt through the back streets , coming out on the far side of the square , a block away from the Consulate . Directly above us towers the shattered wreck of the Telephone Building , the insurgents ' first captured stronghold . It seems impossible that solid stone could be so marked and scarred . Not one of the hundreds of small-paned high windows is entire . Our feet , as we walk , raise a little tinkling sound among the bits of fallen , shivered glass . Across the Plaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rebel forces . The great stone building has been reduced to a shambles . Before it heaps of fallen masonry and broken glass cumber the sidewalks . On the second floor the facade is pierced with a gigantic hole where a cannon ball plunged through wood and stone and iron . We do not stay to look , but hurry on . In front of the Consulate the Anti-War Week ' poster is pocked with bullets ? a too obvious , too patent irony . Inside the Consulate all is bustle and confusion . No one knows when the Italian boat is going to arrive ? perhaps not to-day at all . We must get all such information direct from the Italian Consulate . As for my passport , it will he difficult to issue me a new one . I have not the necessary photographs . We finally manage to talk to the Consul . In emergency , he says , we can break the rules , and orders that the photograph be torn out of the old passport and pasted on the new one . I set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Government : father 's full name ; date of last departure from America . I have to struggle to recall the facts . We wait in the Consulate two hours and a half . At last the passport is ready . We take it and go home , the slow , hesitating route through the tragic , silent streets , dodging carefully from doorway to doorway , raising clenched fists to every car and every gun that passes . Ani is terrified when she learns that we are going . She keeps the baby with her all the afternoon , crying over her and moaning . What will become of her without us ? Can not we take her too ? We wish we could , but no Spaniard can leave the country . She will be safer when we are gone , we tell her . Hatred is already turning against the foreigners , especially the Italians ? the Fascists . It will be better when we are away . We give her money , arrange to pay the rent for the next month , charge her to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sit down to wait . At three o'clock they announce that the Italian ship will not arrive until to-morrow . For the first . time I feel sheer panic . Perhaps it has arrived and they will not let it enter the pat . Perhaps there is no escape for us now The radio is calling on the workmen for volunteers to march against Saragossa . Arm yourselves , the radio insists , arm yourselves With What you can  --  guns , bombs , hatchets , knives . On to Saragossa ! The first columns will leave at midnight from the Plaza Cataluna . The radio is horrible now in its reiterated ? issurances t hat everything calm , in its constant calls for volunteers , for blood transfusions , for nurses , for medicines . ' Attention . Much attention . Cataluna is speaking to you . To all the cities and towns of Spain . Attention . Much attention . ' We shut it off at last . We can not hear to hear it any more . The afternoon drags on . We eat . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Our windows are already suspect , we have been told . The police think that the scattered firing from the roofs came from our house . A passing car shot at one of our swinging shutters this afternoon . At ten o'clock t he Red Cross on the roof of the emergency hospital clown the street is illuminated . It stands out glaring , beseeching , in the night . We undress in the darkness and go to bed . Friday , July 2 1 .  --  The boat will leave this afternoon . We are ready . Our suitcases are packed , our passports stamped by the Italian Consulate . We have nothing to do now but wait . We go out into the streets . In the Pasco de Gracia the second group of volunteers is forming to go on to Saragossa . We walk over to watch them . For nearly a mile clown the long street the camions and heavy trucks are drawn up in single file . They are sheathed with mattresses and tilled With the worker-soldiers . Even on the roofs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mach the port on foot . Perhaps if We stop one of the cars . . . ' We signal several , but they disregard us , speeding on along the streets . For fifteen or twenty minutes we stand on the corner , uncertain , doubtful . It is dangerous to raise the hand to stop a car . The signal might be misinterpreted . At last Salvador , the porter , summons one that draws to a grinding , screeching stop . It is a large green Mercedes , and FAT has been painted roughly on its sides and hood . Two young men are in the driver 's seat . Each of them levels his rifle at us and waits to hear what it is we want . Salvador explains . We are foreigners , trying to get to the port . With the baby and the bags it is difficult on foot . Would the FAI take us in their car ? They shake their heads . They are in a hurry . But then they relent . ' Get in , ' they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They get out and help us with the bags . Ani , still holding the baby , climbs into the back seat between Tino and me . Pepe sits in front with the men . Tino and I lean forward to protect the baby with our bodies . There may be shots . We set off , our guns pointing menacingly at the people in the street , our fists raised in the Anarchist salute . At the port they stop the ear and we get out . We offer them money , but they refuse . We give them cigarettes . They take them and thank us . We wish them luck , they thank us again , and they arc gone . We wait three hours to get through the customs . There are nearly two thousand of us , crowded into the stone-floored waiting room ? Italians , Germans , Swiss , French , Czechoslovaks . I am , I think , the only American . At the last moment an American ship has come to the port . The British are already on the London , riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough . They are ! oohing for money being smuggled out of the country . Bill no one has money . We are all leaving as we are , With little more than the clothes on our backs . None of the Women MO . Wearing hats . I have not even brought one with Inc . We must Say good-bye to Ani now  - -  only the foreigners may pass the door . She and Pepe are almost torn from us by the surging crowd . They wave at us once . Ani is crying . We do not See them again . At last we pass out into the air once more , and the embarkation on the Frill Maria begins . It is a horrible , chaol is jam . There is no order , no one to enforce order . Alen elbow aside women and children in a wild plunge up the swinging stairway . Each one must carry his own baggage . There is no one to help . The stairway ay creaks and groans under the weight of the surging crowd . A woman faints , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying two little children , lets one fall . ner screams pierce through the hubbub of the crowd . They save the child ; it is only bruised . The press and crush on the stairs continue . On the boat the women : trail men are at : once separated from each other . 1 , carrying the baby , pass with the other women and children down stairway after stairway , into the lowest reaches of the ship . This is no passenger vessel , the Principessa Maria , but an army transport that for seven months has been carrying Italian soldiers to and from Ethiopia . There are no cabins and no beds , only row after row of bunks , in double tiers , ? hundreds of them , all alike , touching each other on three sides , ? bare wooden planks with a soiled mattress flung atop ; no blankets . The air is foul . No one can find a toilet , and women are relieving themselves Wherever they can . T. tithe the baby and make my way to the top deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done it I do n't know , hit he has persuaded the Italian Consul to give me a cabin ? one of those belonging to the officers or special passengers . There are perhaps a dozen cabins , and hankfully we arc ushered to our own . After the stench and closeness of the crowded hold this is Paradise . There are two narrow , - bunks , one on top of the other , but clean , and even boasting sheets . We have a chair , and a washbasin with running water : t.itcl a porthole for air . I drop on the lower bunk with a sigh of thankfulness . I can imagine no liner luxury in life . Saturday , July 25 . ? We have all the aspects of a shipload of immigrants . I lere We are , nearly two thousand of us , of every country and class , every type and variety of the human species , huddled together in all-too-close proximity for the space of thirty-six hours , on a free boat trip between the ports of Barcelona and Genoa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countess with her two maids ; two nuns , awkward and ill at ease in ill-fitting , ugly lay dollies ; a very old Spanish priest who does not understand where he is going or why , and weeps silently from time to time , crouched shivering in a corner of the deck . There are children of every size , age , and disposition ; men who have seen t heir stores and businesses destroyed in flames before their eyes ; tired mothers who dare not sleep but must . sit heavy-eyed and W a t chin ! on the decks , shepherding their children . The ship 's hospital is built to accommodate forty beds if necessary . There are forty-seven people in it now , with one doctor to attend them . Mattresses are spread on the floor . Many of t he refugees were brought to the boat in , ambulances , from hosoit als or clinics in Barcelona . One man is paralyzed from the Waist down . Two women are expecting babies at any moment . Another baby has already been born , five hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some seriously . Three times a day the kitchens are prepared to serve us food . We stand in line for it , the Women at one door , the men at another . For an hour and a half we stand in line , three times a day , to receive a dry meat sandwich , or a tin of sardines and a piece of bread . They try to serve the women in the tiny officers ' dining room , but it is not easy . For those who can brave the crush at the door there is even hot soup , macaroni , a slab of fresh-killed meat , and perhaps an orange . But the pushing and the shoving are unbearable . We are like a shipment of savages who know no courtesy , no least restraint . The stronger push the weaker out of line . But the sea is calm and the air cool and still . We are alive , and sale and together . To-morrow we shall be in Genoa . Tino and I go below to our cabin with the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? We reached Genoa at eight o'clock this morning . As we entered t he harbor a giant hydroplane circled low above us , dipping in salute after salute to the now-famous refugees . The quays are crowded with those who have come to look at us . As we slide slowly to our mooring a tremendous cheer goes up from every throat : liva l'italia ! " 17iva it Duce ! ' The crowd on the quays surges nearer . They have brought newspapers for us to read , and they throw them down to us on the ship . Women toss carnations and dahlias to the women and bonbons to the chil-passengers , dren . The bitterness and resentment of yesterday have vanished . We are safe now , in another happier land , and there are few of the passengers whose eyes are not wet with emotion at this strange coming into harbor at the last . Some of those on shore are awaiting friends and relatives on the boat . There are sobs and cries of recognition . But one tall , lean man stands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my wife ? Did n't she come with you ? Annetta ! Annetta ! Where is my wife ? ' A friend on the boat answers him at last . ' I do n't know . She did n't come with us . We do n't know where she is . ' Another , gentler voice suggests : Perhaps she will come to-morrow . They say that they will send another boat to-morrow . ' Then the colloquy is drowned out in the great roar that rises from all throats once again , Italian and alien alike : ' Viva l'Italiar Those on the ship join with those on shore , and , as t he gangplank is slowly lowered , the shout of thankfulness seems to rise and shiver into echoes against the sky .
