The chiefs of the Allied Armies , Generalissimo Maurice Gustave Gamelin and towering ( 6 ft. 4 in . ) General Sir Edmund ( " Tiny " ) Ironside , came together with their staffs on French soil last week . The English Channel was closed south of the Downs by a minefield . Across it into France , General Sir Edmund delivered some 100,000 British troops to the land forces operating under General Gamelin 's supreme command . At the same time the air chiefs met , Sir Cyril L. N. Newall and General Joseph Vuillemin . In the air the Briton is the boss , but in this War , land and air forces are integrated more closely than ever before . All the generals concentrated on a problem for which neither nation had primarily fashioned its arms : an offensive action moving away from France 's great defensive bastion , the Maginot Line . <P> Scene . Having the initiative was their fundamental advantage and General Gam elin moved cautiously to retain it . The sector he chose for his first move against Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100-mi , stretch from Lauterbourg on the Rhine , northwest to the Moselle River ( see map ) . Here the German border and the Westwall guarding it depart from the Rhine , to run across hilly vineyard and forest country . To break through the Wall here does not involve the added difficulty of crossing the Rhine . And neutral Luxembourg guards the French left flank . Last week the lower reaches of the Maginot Line and Westwall , facing each other across the Rhine from Lauterbourg south to the Swiss border , lay quiet except for occasional , experimental artillery exchanges . Soldiers of both armies were reported bathing on their respective sides of the river , in full view of each other . Signs on the German side said : " We have orders not to fire on you until you fire on us . " <P> Tactics . Terse communiqus from the French War Ministry grew increasingly informative as the week 's action developed in the Saar sector . Between the massive , deep networks of the Westwall proper and the international boundary , were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blockhouses ( called " Bunkers " by the Germans ) , bristling with machine guns and connected by deep trenches with the main fortifications behind . The machine guns were so placed that every foot of passable terrain was swept by two or more death-spitting muzzles . First task of the French was to feel out these defenses by aerial photography and by scouting parties on foot and horseback , debouching from the Maginot Line .
