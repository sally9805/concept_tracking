It took them seven weeks , a dozen straining dog teams , an airplane , the life of one constable and the wounding of two others , but last week mad Albert Johnson toppled forward in the snow and bled to death . The reputation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was saved . <P> Nobody knew much about Albert Johnson . A quiet , stocky fellow about 40 years old , he appeared in Aklavik , North West Territories , about a year ago , said he had walked in from Alaska . He seemed to have plenty of money . He built himself a little cabin about 100 miles south of Aklavik , shut himself up in it and was notably cool to strangers . <P> In December Indian trappers complained at the Mounted Police Headquarters in Aklavik that somebody was interfering with their trap lines . For both white and red men , trapping is the only livelihood in winter . Robbing trap lines is a crime , though understandable , but these traps were not robbed . Somebody was smashing snares and deadfalls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . Tracks of the trap-smasher were followed to Johnson 's cabin . Indians raised the alarm , said the man was " mad . " <P> Constables King and McDowell went out to ask Albert Johnson a few questions . They knocked on the cabin door , but Albert Johnson did not answer . Three bullets splintered the door and smashed into Constable King 's chest . McDowell did not wait . He dragged his friend to their sledge and cracked his snake whip as loud as Hermit Johnson 's rifle . Tongues out , the husky dogs plunged forward . They made the 100 miles back to Aklavik in 20 hours . It was a record and it saved Constable King 's life . <P> Ten days later a new patrol mushed out to Rat River to avenge Constable King . Albert Johnson had used the interval to turn his hut into a blockhouse . He had dug the dirt floor out to a depth of four feet , cut loopholes at the floor level . For 15 hours Albert Johnson held off the Mounties . Hand grenades blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an angry woodchuck stern foremost into a dugout , kept fighting . The police retired , disgruntled . <P> For the third time a police patrol set out from Aklavik , but this time Albert Johnson had fled from Rat River , was trying to beat his way through the arctic winter to Alaska and safety . Followed the north country 's greatest man hunt . Trappers rushed their wives to trading posts for safety , then joined the posse . <P> <P> Thirty miles further in the wilderness the posse tracked him down . Mad Albert had built a fort of ice and snow . There was another battle . In it , Constable E. Millen died . Police ammunition ran out and the posse withdrew for supplies , leaving three men to watch the fort . In the middle of the night Mad Albert Johnson slipped away again in a blizzard that covered his snowshoe tracks . <P> After the much-publicized Col. William Avery Bishop , one of Canada 's best known War aces is Capt . W. R. ( " Wop " ) May , a survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's famed Baron Manfred von Richthofen . " Wop " May was at Fort McMurray , Alberta , 1,100 miles away , when Constable Millen was shot . He loaded a bomb rack , took off in an army plane .
