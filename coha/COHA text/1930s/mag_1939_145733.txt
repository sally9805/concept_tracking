The Congress was 150 years old last week and Franklin Roosevelt , as President , was six . Tanned and beaming after his cruise with the fleet , he went from the train that brought him from Charleston , S. C. , to the White House to put on his cutaway . Then with his wife , mother , daughter-in-law Betsey ( Mrs. Jimmy ) and Naval Aide Dan J. Callaghan he went to his front-row pew in St. John 's Church , where Rector Oliver J. Hart III conducted a special anniversary service and prayed for him . <P> Rector Hart : " Almighty and Everliving God . . . we make our humble supplications unto Thee for this Thy servant , Franklin , upon whom is laid the responsibility for the guidance of this Nation . Let Thy fatherly hand , we beseech Thee , ever be over him ; let Thy Holy Spirit ever be with him ; and so lead him in the knowledge and obedience of Thy word , that in the end he may obtain everlasting life . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , but during the hymns ( O God , Our Help in Ages Past and A Mighty Fortress Is Our God ) his fine baritone could be heard clear and confident above the male choir . From church he went to the Capitol to address the joint birthday session of Congress ( see p. 14 ) . <P> &gt; To Eugenio Pacelli , newly His Holiness Pope Pius XII ( see p. 36 ) , the President cabled : " It is with true happiness that I learned of your selection as Supreme Pontiff .

S. , Pius XII has cousins in Flushing and Jordan , N. Y. <P> &gt; Not without good-humored disrespect , Navy men last week called the President " The Greatest Admiral since Nelson , " but took no public exception to his resume for the press of the greatest battle since <P> Trafalgar-the Navy 's hemispheric defense game off the West Indies ( TIME , March 6 ) . In such theoretical exercises , said he , theoretical land masses are imagined on the strategy maps where actually there is only ocean . Gist of his report : the game had failed to demonstrate conclusively whether a foreign fleet could penetrate the U. S. first line of defense and gain a military foothold in the Western Hemisphere , but had proved that the Navy needs added bases in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico . Piquant detail of the game : a defense patrol plane , from an altitude of 15,000 ft. , far at sea , and undetected even by the umpires , spied for 30 hours and reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> &gt; From his post as Ambassador to dying Loyalist Spain the President recalled Claude Gernade Bowers , to consult about recognizing Generalissimo Franco 's regime .
