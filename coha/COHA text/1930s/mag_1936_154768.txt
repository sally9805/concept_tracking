The parties herewith agree to and hereby do marry one unto the other . <P> The party of the first part agrees to love , honor and cherish the party of the second part , and to keep unto him as her lawful husband forever ; and the party of the second part agrees to love , comfort and cherish the party of the first part as his lawful wife forever . <P> The party of the first part does hereby become the lawful wedded wife of the party of the second part , and the party of the second part becomes the lawful husband of the party of the first part ; all to the same effect and extent as if their marriage had been solemnized before a clergyman or proper magistrate . <P> In the Manhattan chambers of New York Supreme Court Justice Samuel I. Rosenman one day last week a man and woman signed their names to the foregoing contract . The woman was Dr. Myrtle Bryan McGraw , 37 , child psychologist of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center 's Babies ' Hospital , campaigner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins Jimmy &; Johnny , Margie &; Florie , in each pair of which one has been carefully trained and the other raised like any other child ( TIME , Sept. 18 , 1933 et seq . ) . <P> The man was Rudolph M. Mallina , 44 , research engineer of Bell Telephone Laboratories . Upon signing the contract the two became man and wife . <P> When efficient Dr. McGraw agreed to marry Mr. Mallina she commanded his attorney , Max Delson , to discover the quickest kind of ceremony . Lawyer Delson tracked down in the Domestic Relations Law a provision for contract marriage , which formerly could be under taken before a notary public but now requires the presence of a judge of a court of record . Mr. Delson could find only two prior instances of contract marriages , one for a Mr. Kelso and a Miss Bryant in 1917 , the other for a man named Wickholm and his bride in 1921 . <P> Marriage contracts are usual in Europe , but are practically always accompanied by religious or civil ceremonies . Lawyer Delson recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take but 35 sec. to sign . They should also appeal to Quakers , Mennonites and other sectarians who dislike to swear oaths . Nevertheless Bride McGraw and Groom Mallina did by no means avoid Godliness . Their contract stipulated that it was as good as a religious ceremony , and day after they signed it they repaired , for a short philosophic talk , to the home of famed Columbia Professor John Dewey , who believes in a vague humanistic God .
