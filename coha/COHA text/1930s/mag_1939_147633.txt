CPI <P> Sirs : <P> The review of Words that Won the War in TIME , Oct. 16 , marks a new high in misstatement . <P> 1 ) The photograph of the lady in tights , carrying my wife 's name , is a fake , without even a remote resemblance to justify the blunder . <P> 2 ) Never at any time did the Committee issue a " Halt the Hun " poster . <P> 3 ) The Committee had nothing whatsoever to do with The Kaiser , the Beast of Berlin . It was produced by a private company , and I disapproved of it absolutely as a vicious appeal to hate . <P> 4 ) The Committee had nothing whatsoever to do with any of the Liberty Loan drives except a protest against many of the " atrocity " posters gotten out by the people in charge . <P> 5 ) My " hand " could not have been seen in the speedy passage of the Espionage Act and the Sedition Act for the reason that I was then , and am now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " as a member of the Censorship Board , Mr. Hyde-Creel had plenty of authority to crack down on the press . " The Board of which I was a member had nothing whatsoever to do with the press , but was concerned entirely with censorship of the mails . I fought organization of this Board , considering it both stupid and unnecessary , but after its organization , persuaded the President to make me a member that I might minimize its activities . The right to exclude newspapers from the mails for seditious utterances was absolutely and entirely in the hands of the Postmaster General , and the manner in which he used it caused me to protest so vigorously that it broke off all personal relations between Mr. Burleson and myself . <P> If you will have your staff take the trouble to go back over the newspaper files , you will find that I was attacked almost daily by Senators , Congressmen and so-called patriotic societies because I would not issue " atrocity " stories and refused at all times to preach hate . <P> GEORGE CREEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture agency which supplied a miscaptioned actress , a sharp rebuke . Herewith the real Blanche Bates ( who never wore tights ) as she appeared in 1901 in Under Two Flags . A private company produced The Kaiser , the Beast of Berlin , though the CPI ( which effectively suppressed other movies ) let it pass without comment . TIME stated that Creel " deplored the national hysteria which his Committee had so successfully fostered . " In general , as Authors Mock &; Larson amply showed , George Creel 's CPI occupied the position of bellwether of the propaganda herd. - ED . <P> Pants Protest <P> Sirs : <P> Do n't you know it 's unkind to strip the illusions from a million or more worshippers of a radio star ? . . . <P> I 'm referring to your brief but brutal description of Ted Malone ( TIME , Oct. 30 ) . I admit his hair is thinning in front , but you scarcely notice it because of his gray-blue eyes that twinkle one minute , go dreamy the next . I admit , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches he 'd look as young as he is instead of older . But personality plus and a million-dollar-smile make the belt line unimportant .
