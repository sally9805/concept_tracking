( See front cover ) <P> Eleven of the twelve Governors of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks met extraordinarily in Washington last week to un-kink another bad knot in the credit rope with which they are trying to pull the country out of its economic ditch . From Boston New York and Philadelphia , from Richmond , Atlanta and Dallas , from Cleveland , Chicago and St. Louis , from Minneapolis and San Francisco , they answered the call for consultation from Eugene Meyer , Governor of the Federal Reserve Board , overlord of the nations credit and currency . Only George Henry Hamilton Governor of the Kansas City Reserve Bank , failed to appear . His deputy went instead . <P> The Governors assembled in the long narrow board room opening upon the grimy interior court of the Treasury building . Around its brownish-yellow walls hung many a chart , their graphs ending in dismal downward dips . ( Zigzags were all in black &; white because color-blind Governor Meyer has trouble with reds and greens . ) After handshakes all around , the Board and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long mahogany table for an all-day session . <P> Six weeks prior the Governors had gathered in this same austere room to launch a Federal Reserve policy to expand credit . Now they were back again to decide its future . <P> Bonds for Paper . The Federal Reserve 's program for abating deflation was a direct outgrowth of the Glass-Steagall bill passed in February . That law permitted the Reserve to substitute U. S. bonds and other Federal securities for commercial paper as part of its currency coverage . Its glut of gold behind paper money was thus ready to be mobilized for more useful purposes . <P> Cash for Bonds . The twelve Reserve banks thereupon went into the open market and began to buy Federal securities , first at the rate of $25,000,000 , later at $100,000,000 per week . At last week 's meeting Governor Meyer informed his conferees that the system now owned the heaviest portfolio of " governments " ( $1,466,000,000 ) in its history . Since late February it had bought $725,000,000 worth . Fortnight ago it first used its privilege of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new form of currency coverage rose to $148,000,000 . <P> Federal Reserve Banks were not buying U. S. securities because they liked their engraving . Their purpose was to build up a mass of new credit which member banks would take and pass along to deflated Business . But member banks were not carrying out their end of this credit-expansion scheme . They let the Reserve 's funds stack up unused at the Reserve banks instead of piping it out to customers .
