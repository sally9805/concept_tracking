txt The Queens Libraries . An article in THE TrMES cited the need of new books for the Queens Borough public library system . This need is unmistakably apparent to one who has used any of its branches even for the most common information , not to mention the noticeable shortage of late books and periodicals . In reply to an inquiry for the names of the Assemblymen in that district , I was told that the information was not available but could probably be procured from one of the newspapers . As one who has used both the Cincinnati and Cleveland ( Ohio ) library systems , also mentioned in the article as being properly equipped , I can fully appreciate the present plight of the Queens system and the task that confronts the book committee headed by John Splain in efforts to make the system what it should be . More power to them ! JOHN V. ROBERTS . Jackson Heights , N. Y. , March 30 , 1934.                  @ @ @
