" At home  --  I 'll wash it there . It is n't serious . Mr. Bale , I ask  --  " She heard her words go fluttering off like wet moths , clogged with chilly darkness . " Come over into the kitchen ; I 'll dress it . I am quite a surgeon . " " That woman . " Irene felt her mouth making the words . Now I 'm saying that woman , the old lady who works for you , your housekeeper . " She went to Mummasburg after dinner , with her nephew , for a few days .

Forever , vines . Wistaria sent her out there , the cat creature , the tropical passion , and the other vine caught and held her .

There was the soapy smell of old wood , washed to its core , smooth as powder . A kerosene lamp burned with steady wick near the northwestwindow , and a big brown insect was trying to get inside and roast himself . He plunged at the pane with ticking resignation .

With her right handp101the girl wrapped the drapery of heavy silk more tightly around her body ; through a mist of oily light she looked down at rumpled brown hair as Dan bent beside her .

" Their voices died and left them , dumb and soddencreatures , marooned with no power of speech . Icy water began to drip from the girl 's fingers . Suddenly , Bale lifted his head and leaped past her . He stood in front of the northwest window , gazing intently through the pane . She saw his fist clenching , squeezing the damp and pinkish cloth . The frenzied insect had ceased batteringwith all suddenness . On the clock shelf , a brass pendulumgrated stubbornly back and forth behind painted glass . " What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . " The window . Was  --  was there some-one  --  ?

" But it occurred to me that I had better close the shutters . " " Oh . " And then , " Yes . Someone might  --  " He continued with his bandaging . " There 's no need to wind it so thickly , Mr. Bale . " " Most certainly . It must be kept clean and  --  protected . " Thunder boomed and tumbled overhead . They listened . The volley pounded away into the north . " Artillery must sound like that . " She drew a long breath . Bale fastened the bandage with windings of white cottonthread .

She could see the muscles of his throat stirring , relaxing , tightening once more . The door swung open ; the aperture framed a world grown suddenly violet , quaking violet light , very thin . A hoarse wind raced through shrubbery beyond the picket fence and enormous raindrops thudded like bursting eggs upon the porch roof . " You ca n't go , yet . " " I must . " Rain crashed down , a blinding sea . Purple light ruled the world again , then utter darkness . Dan pushed the door shit and turned the knob . " Mr. Bale , " Irene cried . She could not face him ; she looked down . Slowly she could feel her breasts toughening , paining her under the high-necked nightgown . She pressed her hands to her temples .

" Ills lips burned hers . She had the feeling that some mysteriousstarchiness had gone out of the fabric of her , in that long moment . I 'm married , she wanted to tell him , I 'm married to " Tyler Fanning . Almighty God , I 'm married ... Mrs. Captain Fanning . The thunder burst against her ears . . .

Monday evening , Elijah Huddlestone went to bed on ahard sofa in Doctor Duffey 's parlor . The old doctor hadceased wearing bandages on his hands two days before , butthe new skin was still thin and sensitive . It was difficult forhim to hold old Salt 's reins , or harness him , or manage adozen other necessary chores . The procreative impulse ofAdams county was not willing to let him take even an essentialvacation ; Mrs. Carl Bearman gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elijah Huddlestone was important to the Bearmans and to the doctor , in those hours .

" Seemsas if we had been to Carlisle and back , Elijah my boy . Andthere 's Emmy Funk 's tumor , and old Kaufman ready to stopbreathing at any moment . Indeed , he may be gone now . " At his own gate , Duffey creaked to the ground and wentup to the porch . A light , inside : Elijah heard the crackle ofEva Duffey 's newspaper . . . She had sewn a dozen pairs ofmittens for the doctor , out of clean white flannel , to permitthe use of his hands . He had four pairs , now , in a damp and bloody bundle under his arm . . .

" Aunt Alice was the doctor 's relative , who had lived and died with the Duffeys long before . " Oh , the sofa 's all right , " he told them . " I 'll put old Salt up , and then come in . " " Did he have plenty of feed at Bearmans ' ? " " Too much , " Huddlestone said . He drove around the square , slapping Salt into an unhappytrot for part of the distance . In front of his own home he dropped a halter hitch around the painted wooden post , studded all over with rusty nail-heads , and went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled too precious and too sweet ; he thought of Pentland Bale 's funeral . His mother slept in the one room on the second story , a wide , low-ceiled place with a boxed stairway leading to it . Elijah lit a candle after he had closed the front door , and moved to the stair door . " Ma , " he called to the little woman above . There was a muffled sigh as she roused herself . " Lijy ? " she asked . " I ) oc wants me to sleep over there . " " Is somebody dangerous ? " " I guess old Peter Kaufman is pretty sick . . . They 've got a new girl at the Bearmans ' . We just drove in from there . " " Which Bearmans ? She-that-was-a-Bittner ? " " No , the ones out on the Newville road . Carl , it is . " Hep105swallowed , wet his lips , and then asked , " You have n't heard any news ? War news , I mean . " She echoed , " War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her false teeth . " No , Lijy . Why ? " " Oh , " he said . " Get you a clean night-shirt . There 's two fresh-ironed in the kitchen . And be careful you do n't drive too fast . I do n't like that old Salt , " she added sleepily to herself . He said , " All right . No , I wo n't . He wo n't go fast anyway . " He closed the stair door and tramped into the kitchen . The candle-light revealed a flat dish of oil pickles and two slices of bread , on the kitchen table . His mother always left something for him when he was out in the evening . " Lijy likes a snack , " she told people . He spooned up a generous portion of the limp , syrupy flakes and spread them upon one slice of the dark bread , then plastered the other slice over it . The sandwich tasted very good . . . if he were in the army , he could have no late evening snacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him jars of pickles wheneverpossible . He held the sandwich clamped in his mouth while he thumbed through the heap of clean , ironed clothing . He folded the night-shirt and jammed it into his coat pocket . Then , food in hand , he went back to the front room . The single flame of his little white torch made the familiar place waver with a calm mystery . Over in the corner was the tall " dress form " which his mother used in her work . It had a quilted bosom and quilted hips , with wire mesh in the back and below . Saucers of pins and the flat snake of a measuring tape lay before it like votive offerings . The figured bombazine for Mrs. Bedford Fanning 's new Sunday dress weighted down the sewing table . He thought , " I 'll wager it takes a lot of yards to cover her up . " In the opposite corner of the room stood Elijah 's Vincennesmusket , with a saber bayonet fixed . He set his candlep106on the window sill and picked up the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered , and juggled the musket about . He felt his knees stiffening , the small of his back harsh and tight . He about-faced , the gun across his shoulder . The dress form loomed before him , a headless creature which yet managed to seem monstrous and smug . He grunted : . . Shoot the guts out of you , you rebel son of a bitch ! " The dress form waited , humbly , for him to shoot . Then he felt silly , and slammed the bayoneted gun back into its corner . What if someone had been walking home , late , and happened to look through the window  --  . A thick book on the mantel-shelf : he took that , and blew out the candle . He went out to the carryall , book in his grasp , munching the last of his cucumber-pickle feast . Twin tulip trees beside the fence rustled sleepily . He made the circuit of the black square , put old Salt away in the smutty barn , walked around to the Duffey 's front porch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed , but Eva had moved her lamp into the parlor adjoining the office , and had spread a sheet and comforter on the sofa . Elijah undressed . His hands smelled of horse . After he had removed his truss and donned the cotton night-shirt , he went out to the kitchen sink to wash . . . Pendulous flesh , heavy ache , a useless fold of his abdomen bulking down . He pressed his body against the low side of the sink as he washed . Back in the parlor , he lay on the couch with a mound of rocky little pillows at his back . He screwed the lamp flame higher . Elements of Military Art and History , by Edward De La Barre I ) ullarcq . He had paid a fortune for it : four dollars . His mother had said nothing when she saw the book ; probablyshe thought enough . But he had intended to buy a new hat and some shoes , out of the money he made from book selling , and he had bought neither . No one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to get it.  |p107He  'd never let Daniel Bale know that he had the book . He knew all too well what Dan would say . He tried to read about Waterloo . Blucher . He wondered how that was pronounced : Bloosher or Blutcher or how . In spite of his interest , he began to feel very sleepy . The cucumbertaste oozed stealthily into his throat . . . Stubbornly , he read on . Paragraph after paragraph of tight little print . The boys of Gettysburg began to form between his eyes and the type . He saw them all , McKosh and Deffenbaugh and the seminary lads . He saw himself . Miraculously , he was hard and fierce and strong , and his loins were firm as driving-harness . Captain Gubbe , he ordered , take your men and deploy as skirmishers . Fall back slowly if they strike our front ; I want time to re-form my line . Miraculously , too , in spite of the braided eagles of his rank , he had the Vincennes musket with him . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him in ghastly phalanx  --  line after line of headless , quilted enemies . He slept uncomfortably , his neck crooked across a green hair-pillow . The lamp flame grew forked and burned in varnished soot within the squat lamp chimney . He slept ; the book slid deep between his legs . In a pearl-blue dawn he awakened , chilly and cramped and sore , to find the dry lamp wick stinking as it smouldered , and to hear Doctor Duffey out in the hallway saying kindly , " Did you come all this way by yourself , Marta ? You wait and go back with me . " A child 's voice murmured something . Elijah stood up and blinked . His ruptured abdomen puffed with sudden pain ; he put on the truss before he went to the hall door . The doctor was there , solemn and sleepy , looking like a dressed-up herald or innkeeper from some medieval pageant . He wore a short night-shirt which hung straight from his round middle , and showed the firm calves of his hairy legs through splits at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Duffey . " There she goes . "  |p108In  the soft dampness of early morning , the little yellowhairedgirl stood on the block at the roadside , struggling to reach the broad back of a farm horse . " Old Kaufman 's grandchild  --  she says he 's slipping fast . You get dressed , Elijah , and put old Salt into the carryall . I 'll be ready by then . " Huddlestone watched Marta go riding away on the clumsy chestnut stallion . He shook his head . " I wonder if there 's any war news ? " " War news ? No doubt , no doubt whatever . There 's hell and damnation every day , and especially on the finest of mornings . " The doctor sighed his way up the stairs . Elijah pinched the glowing wick in the parlor , and drew on his clothes . He tried to imagine that this was a call to arms : while he slept in his tent , the sentries had come racing in with news of a morning assault . That was what happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentries did n't get there soon enough to warn . . . He stopped in the kitchen and drank deeply from the blue dipper which hung over the water pail . The water tasted of moss , of frog pools and staleness . He hurried to the barn , and prodded the white horse out of its dreams . The eastern sky was frothy with apple colors . He jangled along the pasty driveway in the carryall , but Doc had n't come out of the house yet . Huddlestone snapped the leash of the hitching-block in the ring of old Salt 's bit , and went into the house . He found the unshaven doctor , silk hat on the back of his head , hunting through a cabinet for some hidden potion . " It 's the strychnine I 'm hunting , " the old man said , over his shoulder . " Maybe it 's just as well I do n't find it , poor old feller . " The office was a cluttered , smelly hall along the north side of the house ; a partition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion it . The walls reeked with red/and-blue charts of the human body , and steel engravings of famous surgeons . In the exact center of the apartment stood a long , high table covered with black oilcloth , and with a padded cushion for a head-rest . Against the south wall rested a row of unmatched cabinets , some with glass doors , some without . In this room was the supreme attainment of medical arts , as practised in Gettysburg . On that big , black table , Duffey had more than once proposed to relieve Huddlestone 's rupture by an operation . He believed it possible to do so , but could promise nothing . . . Elijah shuddered when he thought of ether , of the drugged helplessness from which he might not return . He said , " Doc , there 's strychnine in your little satchel ... no , I mean the old one on your desk . This one . " He caught up the bag , and Duffey followed him to the door , flexing his stiff fingers inside the white flannel mittens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a vast and flowery emptiness within all atmosphere , and into this vacuum you might plunge your face , and drink deeply , and be refreshed . Doc climbed into the carryall beside his driver . Sitting thus , he seemed nearly as tall as Iluddlestone , for the aged cushion on the driver 's side was pressed to a deep hollow by years of the doctor 's weight ; Elijah sat in the round hole , inches lower than the surrounding surface . The carriage had a decided right-hand slant ... They turned left toward York street , and west once more through the Diamond . Cautious smoke crept up from a few kitchen chimneys ; an early workmanthudded his way south under the arching trees of Baltimorestreet . " It 's a great morning to die , Elijah , " said Adam Duffey . At the extreme edge of town , when they had passed the Knouse and Bale houses and moved up a long slope toward Cashtown , they saw a strange caravan poised for a momentp110on the rim of Oak Ridge , then spilling rapidly downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weeds . The wagon which rocked unsteadily in their direction was an ancient vehicle , with blistered blue paint scabbing on its wooden sides . Two deep-chested horses , muddy-hocked and panting , tossed their heads and began to shy away from the carryall . The wagon was crammed with children , upendedchairs , lamps , women , cloth bundles . Behind it . rode a pale boy on another horse . A lame shepherd dog , staggeringon three legs , began a challenging bark which ended in a howl . " It 's Antiques and Horribles , " grunted Duffey , " sure as you 're born ! " The wagon crashed to a halt opposite the rig . A fateyedman in sweaty denim waved a broken willow switch . " They come to Jambersburg ! " he roared . Elijah flung the reins around the whip-stock , and climbed out . He stared up at the crazily laden wagon ; wild eyes blinked down . " What 's the matter ? " Doc called past him . " Rebels ! " bellowed the farmer . Saliva dripped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-green world skating past him in a tilted whirl . " Where ? The rebels . . . where ? " " To Jambersburg they come at night . I guess is maybe millions : they take my colt , they kill the kelver ! " A woman wailed : " And jickens they kill . Maybe they burn our house down once  --  " Duffey had joined Elijah in the road . . . They stood there marvelling , listening , letting old man Kaufman die unaided ... The straw-bearded man  --  his name was Christian Zeigenfuss , and he said he had a son in the One Hundred Forty-eighth P.V .  --  was quite mad with horror . His farm was four miles from Chambersburg ; in the first blackness of the previous evening , the family had looked out and seen a hostp111of dark horsemen rush into their yard . More came , and more ; the lane was choked with them . They wanted water and food , and they paid with great wads of ragged paper which could never be money . They talked in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rebels . Yes , they had taken his colt  --  it was a fine sorrel colt , worth a fortune . And after the whole posse moved on , a party of three men had come back and killed two calves . They killed them and bled them and cut them up by the light of a burning brush-pile , before the eyes of Mr. Zeigenfuss . Yes , and chickens  --  how many , he did not know . Perhaps within a few hours the rebels would return ; they might have learned in Chambersburg that young Dias Zeigenfuss was a Union soldier , and then they might kill the whole family ... The farmer 's tribe packed as many valuables as they could muster , into this wagon . They fled . The world was ending , outrageously , all around them . Ach , yes , Chambersburghad been burned . They looked back and saw vast red flares against the sky . Other people with faster horses had passed them , but must have turned off somewhere along the way . Mrs. Zeigenfuss had a brother who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them there . Millions of rebels . They laughed while they killed the poor kelver . They had guns , and most of them wore two pistols . One man , cried the pale thirteen-year-old , had no less than four pistols . And Chambersburg must have been burned ; probablyevery soul there had been killed . There were enormous pink spots in the skyElijah kept telling himself , " This is true . I 'm standing here , talking to these people ; they 've seen repels . The rebs are here , in Pennsylvania . We 're invaded .. . That little dirtymouthedgirl : she 's looked upon the enemy . " He thought of turning old Salt and whipping him up , racing home for the Vincennes musket . He had powder , but no bullets as yet . The bayonet . . . " God , " he said to the doctor , hoarsely , " they might even come here . What in time is the army doing ? " Duffey shook his head . His round eyes were very bright . He assured the hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let them rest for awhile . He and Huddlestone stood beside the carry-all and watched the Zeigenfuss family scrambling down the hill , horses and wagon and featherbeds and all . " We must hurry , Elijah  --  poor Kaufman , he was slippingfast , Marta told me ! Hurry ! " he squawked with a burst of amazing wrath . Huddlestone flailed old Salt across his gray rump . The horse snorted , and lurched into a stiff gallop . From the top of McPherson 's hill the two men gazed west along the misty strand of the Pike . The sun crept clear of the horizon and gilded distant ribbons of forest , caught a jeweled flash from some farmhouse window . " Praise Peter , " Duffey sighed , " no enemies in sight . " He meditated for a moment , clinging to the seat as the carry-all bounded and wailed across the clods . " I do n't know what they 'd want with us , to be sure . I 've got no calves for them to butcher , poor hungry creatures that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His lips felt shapeless and woolly . " The boys 'll all be out as soon as they hear the news , Doc . I ought to be back there . " Elements of Military Art and History began to unleaf itself in his brain ; page after page , an incredible volume . " Somebody ought to send a message to Harrisburg , " he heard himself yapping at the doctor . Old Peter Kaufman had been dead for ten minutes , when they reached the farm . He was ninety-one years old , and had long been ill of heart trouble.  | . Three church bells and the fire bell were splintering in a wicked medley ; it seemed as if some leafy lining of the village had been shredded to reveal a brass pulsation which had always existed there , but only in this hour was being heard . , In his night clothes , Bale went out on the upper balcony and looked for smoke . North , east , southeast , the rim of trees was unsmudged . He thought , " They 're ringing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if  --  " But no , no , it was too absurd . He went back to his room and dressed . He splashed his face over the wash-basin and ran down the stairs ; he was alone in the house ; Mrs. Wurke was not to return until Wednesday . . . It was impossible to consider food while that mysterious palpitation of irpn and brass kept echoing , and less than a mile away . He shut the outer door , and ran through the gate . Blue , golden , breathless , the morning arched overhead . Mrs. Knouse was poking her head out of the front door , weird wrappings of faded yellow caught around her neck and shoulders , " Daniel ? " she cried . " Daniel ? " " What ? " he asked . " Is it a fire ? " " I do n't know , Mrs. Knouse , I 'm sure . " Past her lot , he began to run . His feet came down in a hollow trample on the first length of wooden sidewalk . Far behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mingled wheel-whirring and rattle of loose hoofs which might have been a runaway . A man 's whistle pierced up as Bale turned . The Duffey carryall was bounding over the ruts ; Doc leaned out , waving his hat .. . Dan swung into the highway . Old Salt bore toward him , neck stiff and eyes puffy as oysters . Elijah sawed at the reins : whoa ... whoa ! Dan caught a side-rod and swung himself sprawl- ing into the rear seat . He cried , " Are you killing old Salt , or what ? " Elijah brought the lines down in a murderous slap on the animal 's back . Doc was leaning over the seat . " The rebel army 's invaded Chambersburg , Dan , " he said . " Hang on . Elijah thinks he 's a Jehu  --  " " How do you know ? " " We met a party of folks running like all hell was after them . Likely they 've spread the news in town . Hear the bells ? " " You ca n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had a feeling of bafflement , a deep and disappointing perplexity . " Well , Hud , " he cried , " if that is true , you 're one ahead of me . " Elijah laughed , a high-pitched carol . He said nothing . The back of his long neck was red . . . The carryall swayed around the half-turn to the left and straightened out again . Here the homes were built close to the sidewalk ; people hung out of windows , and children gaped from every porch rail . A straggling group of youths with schoolbooks under their arms ... running in the road , they howled wolfishly as the rig shot past them . Duffey groaned , " And that 's part of Gettysburg 's army . They want to have the war right on the seminary campus , I doubt not . " " Look here , " Bale cried , " are you sure the story 's true ? " The doctor 's forehead pushed up in fleshy rolls . " Dan , you should have seen that Dutchman ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They rocked out into the Diamond , and I-Iud was pointing with his whip : across the way stood a loaded farm wagon with a fringe of men around it . Elijah turned for a scant second , and his eyes met Dan 's . " Talk to that old scare-cat , Dan , and you 'll believe there 's an invasion . It 's not a lot of talk any more . " He swung the heaving , gassing horse toward the hitch rack by the grocery.  | .. Those bells were still clanging , pound-pong-pong , as if they were the metal heart which kept life pumping through the whole town . A buckeye tree grew up through the rusty brick sidewalkbeyond the rack , and against the trunk of the tree a wide board had been nailed . A tall man , hammer in hand and mouth made speechless by its load of tacks , was fastening a white paper oblong to the board . In a semicircle around him more men were grouped , trying to read over his shoulder . " Look there , " Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Pock called , " It 's a proclamation from Andy Curtin . " The man with the hammer turned . He nodded vacantly at them ; he was Julius Orcutt . Dan saw those same reddish lights in the dull eyes as they rested on him . Painstakingly , Orcutt expelled another tack from his mouth ; his hammer drove it home . There was a continual scattering of weak guffaws . " Wants a lot of soldiers already . " " You better go , Henry . You 'd make a good soldier , uh ? " The men moved closer in the semicircle . Elijah finished tethering old Salt , then turned and started rapidly across the Diamond . Only the firebell was ringing , now ; the church bells seemed worn out , but a nervousthrom , throm of bludgeoned iron still made the air stagger . Before Huddlestone reached the wagonload of refugees , Bart McKosh stepped out to meet him . The veteran wore a pair of blue pantaloons pulled hastily over his soiled flannel night-shirt ; one empty trouser-leg hung loose against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's elbow , Mr. Pock was murmuring , " Welcome to anything I got . I tell you , gentlemen , I wo n't fight with ' em . If they come to town they can take my whole stock , and never hear a peep out of me . I got a growing family , and  --  " A patriarch with a stringy beard grunted : " Gesetz ist machtig , machtiger ist die Not . " There was a dry , apprehensive chuckle from the little group around the tree . People came in a thin scurrying from every street which fed into the public square . Children ... the young men , thought Bale , where were they ? How many regiments had gone from southern Pennsylvania ; how many companies out of this county ? Here were white-beards , silver-hair , the paunches and knobs of middle age . And young men : there were himself and Elijah , and the one-legged Bart McKosh , and a mutilated gawk named Ernie Dryer . Boys from school  --  pink noses , cow licks , unformed chins  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Young men of Gettysburg , he cried to himself : where have you gone , and how are you finding it there ? You rebels raiding Chambersburg , are you young too ? Close at hand sounded the rapid pat-pat of hoofs ; childrenscooted to safety as a gray horse whirled out of York street . Astride it joggled a man whose dark coat and hat seemed hung in a light veil of dust ; the slanting sun caught a dozen glitters from the buckles and buttons and sword which were a part of him . The crowd beside the farm wagon turned to stare with new suspicion as he loped past them . This was no idling soldier , home on furlough : he was too purposeful , too hot and dusty . He halted in front of the men under the buckeye tree ; his big mare sniffed suspiciously toward old Salt . " Major Haller , acting under orders of General Couch . " Stirrup leather crunched as he swung down . " Who 's in charge here ? " The major dusted his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council , " someone muttered . " You 've seen Governor Curtin 's proclamation , people . You 're apt to be invaded , any moment . I want to talk to your borough officials , immediately . "  |p117Julius  Orcutt stepped down into the road , hammer still clenched in his hand . " Dr. Kendlehart is not present at this moment . Can I be of any assistance ? My name is  --  " The major shrugged . " I 'm informed that you 've got some sort of militia in this town . Correct ? " He twisted his head impatiently . " What 's that infernal noise ? " " Fire-bell , " came a chorus . " John Burns is ringing it . " " I wish to heaven John Burns would stop it , " grunted the officer . " It 's to call people out . The whole rebel army is in Chambersburg ! " Major Haller said , " The whole rebel fiddlesticks . We 've heard all about that  --  it was Jenkins ' cavalry , on a raid . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . However , that is neither here nor there . I want to talk to your townspeople about this militia company . It is imperative that we Pennsylvanians organize for defense at the earliest possible moment . " The fire-alarm had stopped suddenly , shorn off ; its cessationpained the empty air ... Bart McKosh and Elijah were hurrying across the Diamond ; even at a distance you could see the fever in Elijah 's cheeks . McKosh looked more dark and sallow and brow-beaten than ever . He hurled himself along with prodigious leaps of his single leg . . . The army officer walked forward to meet him . Doctor Duffey 's mittened paw closed on Dan 's arm . " You 've still got a grip , " Bale said ... The old doctor was staring past him with glazed and squinting eyes . " Watch , " he kept saying , " over there by the corner . Watch ! It 's Constable John Burns , and he 's a fire-eater if ever I see one . Look  --  the poor old relic is lugging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached Major Haller : " I got military experience  --  fought in two wars , I have . Teamed with the army down in Maryland ... ai n't so old as I might be  --  " The men could barely hear his words.  | He glared at the officer with bitter , Indian eyes ; his . loose jaw kept wiggling from side to side . " My hands are coming back to me , " Duffey chuckled harshly . He pulled Dan toward the carryall . " Look how I can take hold .. . And do you know , this puts me in mind of when I was in Philadelphia and we had the plague . Cholera . " " This is worse than cholera , " Bale said . " It takes hold in the same way . . . Would you mind riding home with me ? I want to see if I can drive old Salt without too much pain and trouble . Likely I 'll have to do my own driving from now on , if Elijah goes off to shoot at folks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only a raid . They 've gone back south again . " Doc climbed into the carryall and unwound the reins from the whipstock , working with slow and flabby gestures . " Devil a bit of satisfaction I can find in that . They 'll be back for a full meal ... this is a terrible war , Dan . Tutchk , " he ordered old Salt . Sullenly , the white horse hobbled in a half circle ; the wheels scraped against the body of the rig . " He was treated shameful , poor horse . We 'll be taking it easy now , no matter who has pups . Tutchk . " As they squeaked toward York street , they passed a bulky man who was walking rapidly away from the crowd beside the Zeigenfuss family . He lifted his head for a glance at Bale , then turned away again . " Elmer Quagger , " nodded Adam Duffey . " Said to be a Copperhead . " " Yes . fie is one . That 's what people are whispering of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Quagger was staring malignantly after him . Duffey cocked his head on one side . " What is it ? " " Nothing . Quagger  --  he reminded me of something ... " " Reminded you ? " " Yes . I do n't know what . It does n't matter . " For a fewp119minutes he tormented his mind , trying to decide why Quagger'svicious glare had confused him . Then he gave it up . Quagger was no one to fear . Still  --  his faceDuffey sighed . " Yes , I 'll be wholly capable of driving . Eva can help me with the harness and so on , if Elijah goes off to fight ... You come with me , Dan , and we 'll have a bite of breakfast . I doubt Elijah realizes there 's such a necessityas breakfast in the world . " " That rupture of his , " Bale asked . " Do you think he  --  ? " " Jesus , " said the doctor . " It will kill him completely if he tries to be a soldier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was early the next afternoon before Dan saw Irene Fanning . She had not been out of his mind since the hour when he surged over her body , but the great riddle of their attraction , their immediate and mutual sin , was buried deep when the bells began to ring . He thought that his brain must 1 ) e boxed into four compartments  --  shelvesor drawers or cubicles . In one of these lay his past life , and in another his fumbled knots of philosophy . The two remaining boxes were stewing with treacherousthoughts of the war and of Tyler Fanning 's wife . He tried to keep them penned , each consciousness in its proper place , but paper by paper , word by word they would curl up and occupy him , plaster his soul , blow forever behind his eyes . In the rain of Sunday night he had felt only the proud possessiveness of a male , the glut of pure satisfaction . She was willing ; she was no child ; he had bent her scruples aside if any actually existed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her eyes . This must be one form of love  --  he was not certain  --  he had never lain with an intelligent woman before . . . All her emotion , whatever sensitiveness and tender pride she possessed , were undiscovered and nonexistent ... Only when he walked back with her through the wet pasture and left her to creep alone into the house of her betrayed marriage , only then had he felt the self-abomination of the skulker , and not for long . Most desperately he had wanted to see her on Monday , but she did not appear , though he watched the Fanning place for hours . . . Certainly she would be in the crowded Diamond on Tuesday morning . He ate a light breakfast with the Duffeys , and went back up York street . Drums and fifes were playing , at the college grounds , where Major Haller was examiningthe Gettysburg volunteers . A coterie of men still gathered near the grocery , trying to digest Governor Curtin 's proclamation . Dan stopped and read the message . He could recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathos of a perplexed nation seemed wailing in every massive phrase . An army of rebels is approaching our border ... I now appeal to all the citizens of Pennsylvania , who love liberty and are mindfulof the history and traditions of their revolutionary fathers , and who feel that it is a sacred duty to guard and maintain the free institutions of our country , who hate treason and its abettors , and who are willing to defend their homes and their firesides , and do invoke them to rise in their might and rush to the rescue in , this hour of imminent peril . The issue is one of preservation or destruction . " That officer , he says Abe Lincoln 's called for a hundred thousand men . " " What I want to know is , what 's the army doing ? Whynt they chase them rebels and give ' em a trimming ? Whynt  --  " " But Ezra says they got to go for six months already . They wo n't take ' em by the army less nor that ; six months is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hay ai n't in . And maybe he gets killed yet . "  |p121The  old sage with the yellow whiskers nodded his head . He was a creaking , rheumy-eyed man with a bad breath ; his name was Truckenmiller , and neighbors were fond of telling how he had worn out three wives . All of his sons had run away as soon as they were grown , but now he was too old to harm anyone .. : He said , " Blinder Lifer schadet nur . " But no one was paying much attention to him . He sagged on the broken bench in front of the store , making little dents in the dust with the tip of his cane . Then he looked up again and poked his cane at Dan . " Maybe you go , " he said . " A so ong young man to make war , ja ? Das Alter wagt , die Jugend wagt . " The scattering conversation stopped , dead . People behindDan turned to stare at him , and those in front of him were studious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of telling the moth-eaten tyrant that youth had more reason for careful consideration than age . But it would do no good . These people had made up their minds concerninghim ; perhaps there were those who envied him his solitarycourage , but he rather doubted it . He moved silently through the group and walked around the corner into Chambersburg street ... Far to the north , on the campus , there was a burst of cheering . The drum corps skirled up : Zu Lauterbach hab ich mein Strumpf verlor'n , in a grandioseand gaudy spasm . Dan wondered if Demon was there , playing . And then the woman came into his mind and stayed until he went home and fell upon his bed . He dozed awhile . Disordered dreams trooped across his sweaty slumber , and all the time he was aware that more wagons went past the house than had gone past in many days , and off in the green distance the drums rattled and throbbed . ... He got up at noon , and bathed , and went down into the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Sunday ; he should have brought more from the baker's.  | But there were cheese and fresh milk and soda crackers , and he opened a jar of peaches . He ate , and washed two days ' accumulation of dirty dishes ; all the time , the clock whispered gutturally at him . He thought : " That 's the clock . Same one . It was ticking Sunday night . . . beside this table I wrapped the bandage , here I put my arms around her . We went into the living room to the couch . So remarkably unreal and remote  --  an experience in the life of someone else . " He walked to the window and peered across at the Fannings ' . House , barn and out-buildings baked in a mid-day glare ; chickens wandered drearily about in the scratched blue shade . And Demon nowhere in sight ; his mistress must have permitted him to go to the village with his drum . But surely he could n't go to war , if anything so idiotic occurredDan took a bucket out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faded palings of the yard fence , he could hear the jingle of Cybo 's bell . There was a growl , a scuffle ; someone cried shoosh ! Cybo sprang through a gap in the barrierand scuttled across the Bale yard . Mrs. Knouse rose up out of larkspurs , her mouldy face shadowed by a sun-bonnet . " That dumb critter , " she scolded , " he makes dirt in my lilies ! " Her chin was brown and dripping ; she held a trowel in one gloved hand and a peach-basket in the other . " I will not leave my plants for them bad men to take , " she explained , fiercely . There was fresh earth pressed across the front of her gray calico apron . " Not these bulbs , you bet . I 'll put ' em down in the cellar where they ca n't be stole . " Dan heard himself asking , " You mean  --  the rebels ? Why , that was just a raid . They went right back south . And Chambersburgwas n't burned , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry , according to word received downtown . It 's said that they headed back toward Hagerstown and  --  " She shrieked , " If they come here , they 'll never find my tulpen ! These are exquisite plants , Daniel , and if they comep123to Gettysburg they 'll never find ' em down in the cellar under my washtubs  --  " He said , weakly , " I do n't think it 's that serious , " and went back into the house with his water pail . He sat at Pentland Bale 's desk and tried to write a letter to Lucas Mite in Minnesota . But the letter was flimsy , a puny recounting , not at all the sort of a letter Mite would expect . ... Doctor Duffey , he thought . No , he 's busy enough ; I sha n't bother him . Hud will be drilling with those youngsters , or God knows what . And no one moves , over at the Fanning house . The ' place is bewitched . Only Cybo goes jangling across the pasture with his idiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown timothy , and lies in the hot sun and lets flies bite him .. . Room after room , all empty , all grotesque and stolid and inhabited by unfriendly presences . The day was stifling . He took off his shirt and tramped up and down the stairs , trying to make vague errands for himself . At four o'clock he had what he thought was a very good idea . He lifted the trap door in the kitchen floor and crawled down into the pit beneath , hunting for whiskey . Ile found it : a keg . PentlandBale had declared that it was an improvement on the old-time Monongahela . . . Dan filled a decanter and carried it up to his room . He read Meister Eckhart and Coleridge . He read two copies of Arthur 's Home Magazine ... Later he drank more whiskey and was moderately sick . Over behind the seminary someone kept shooting with a musket . Practisingmarksmanship , learning how to kill a man . The wide reports rolled in , round and precise and portentous , until dusk put an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down the Springs road . Then he had been asleep and he slid up out of hot dark . ness because a voice was calling him . " Hey  --  " a man wailing at him , over and over , " Hey ... hey , Dan ! " Dan shook himself ; his lead body became bristling to life . He got up and crept to the window . There was a black smudge against the dimness below , and that smudge was Elijah . " Hello , " he croaked to the smudge . " I did n't expect you 'd be asleep , " Huddlestone said . " No , I was n't ... I guess I was , too . " " I 'm very sorry . But I wanted  --  " Dan told him , " Come upstairs . The door is unlatched . " While he lit the lamp , he could hear Elijah poking cautiouslyup the long stairway . Dan opened the door ... Hud was in his shirt sleeves , and bareheaded . He looked at Dan . " Why , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . " " No , " Bale said . He slouched back loosely on the bed . " Liquor 's over there on the table . Help yourself . " Elijah grinned . " Drinking all by yourself ? That is odd . I did n't know you drank much at all . " " I do n't . " Huddlestone took the glass stopper out of the decanter , hesitated , and dropped it in again . " I want to tell you : it looks like we 're going . " " Going  --  where ? " " Harrisburg . We 'll likely be mustered tomorrow after noon by Major Haller . We 'll be part of Couch 's Army of the Susquehanna . " " Army of the Susquehanna . " Dan heard a hard , tight voice which might have been his own . " We look at reality , and we do not see it . It is colorless , without any form or surfaceor consistency . We listen for reality : it has no sound .. . no shape . Nothing that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice stopped speaking ; only it breathed heavily . Hud asked , " What ails you ? God . " " That was a Chinaman , " the compact voice went on again . " Lucas Mite introduced me to him . A very strange man , Mite . He came from Connecticut ; I think he killedp125someone there before he came west . And he has a conscience . He tries to assuage it with Shakespeare and all sorts of things . Well , he had a little book  --  a paper one . The person who wrote it claimed that it was translated from the Chinese language . There was a man named Lao Tze , who lived a long time before Jesus Christ . He wrote a book called the Tao Teh King . . . No reality . " Long silence . Elijah looked somber , and swished the whiskey about in its carved red bulb . " He was only a Chinaman with a queue , probably , " Bale said . " No one to be concerned about . Even if there is n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You must be real drunk , " Elijah said . " Yes . I must be . " Insects muzzled about in the elm branches near the window . . . a dog which always barked , up near McPherson 's . " Well , I would n't have *routed you out if I had known you were this way . I mean , " Elijah added peevishly , " talking about men from Connecticut and Chinese people and reality , and all . This is pretty serious business , being invaded , whether you believe it or not . " Dan said , " The devil . " He moved over to the washstandand bumped against it heavily . He took up the pitcher . " That water is foul if it 's been here long , " Elijah muttered . " Give me the pitcher . " He wrenched it out of Dan 's grasp and went away downstairs . Bale sat at the big table with his head on his arms . He heard the pump squawling . Hud came back with fresh water for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl . " Thank you , " he said . " I hope I have n't offended you . " Elijah sat on the sill of the open window . " No , I 'm too excited for anyone to offend , I guess . Being mustered in  --  " " I want to understand it correctly . You mean that you 're all going into United States ' service ? "  | " Not all . Bart McKosh ca n't go , naturally , and Haller said no one would think of accepting Ernie Dryer  --  not now , anyway . And those musicians are just a kind of pick-up to help with the drill . But most of the rest  --  " " They 'll take  --  you ? " The insects buzzed for an uninterrupted moment . " Of course they will . What did you think ? " He spoke sharply . " They say there 's all kinds of ruptures in the army nowadays . And  --  well , I know a lot about this business . I 've studied and  --  Likely they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm only sorry I could n't seek out a lot of recruits and get a commission , but that may come later . " " I see . " Elijah was folding tiny creases in the loose cloth of his pantaloons . " There 's considerable stew and fuss . The war department refused to take volunteers for less than six months , so Governor Curtin 's trying to get them to accept us just for the emergency  --  until we 've helped repel the invasion . Haller says he expects permission from Mr. Stanton by tomorrow afternoon . Then we 'll go ahead . There 's all our crew who 've been drilling  --  that includes four boys from the Sem  --  and I understand we 'll get at least fifty out of the college . Maybe we 'll have nearly a hundred . " Dan asked , " And then ? " " Why , we 'll be sent to Harrisburg . They seem to think the rebels will head for there , if they come north again . " " Do you actually believe that you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restlessly . " Of course I do . " His dark eyes seemed very large in his thin face . " Dan  --  the reason I came over here tonight  --  it is n't so late , only about ten o'clock  --  Listen , Dan . I want you to drop everything . Come along with us . Be a good fellow , why do n't you ? " Bale cried savagely , " Not for you or anybody . " " Do you realize what this invasion means ? "  | " Well , what does it mean ? " Elijah clenched his fists . The knuckles were squeezed and bloodless . " This is our country . They 're coming up here . I mean , they 're going to try to . A man who wo n't fight for his home is  --  " He stopped short , swallowing . " Yes , " Dan whispered , after a moment . " You ca n't understand how I feel . But I 'm not going to kill anybody , Lever again . Think of this , Hud : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You and I met , enemies . We killed each other . Why ? We 'd have been friends if we were neighbors here in Gettysburg . And because I killed you , your mother must be robbed of you for the rest of her life . " " Hell , " said Elijah . " Well , that 's it . " " Then you wo n't consider it ? " " No . You ought to know that . " Huddlestone smacked his palms together . " All right . " He walked toward the door . " How about Amelia Niede ? Does she know you 're going ? " Huddlestone stood stock-still . " I saw her this morning for a moment . She was with Uncle Otto and her Ma , down at Pock 's . She  --  Mealy 's a nice girl ... I 'd like to talk to her some more before I go . If I had any money to spare , I 'd hire a turn-out and take her for a drive in the morning . But I had to square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dan fumbled in his pocket . " No , " Elijah snarled . " Do you think that was why I was telling you ? " Bale stood up clumsily . He had a wad of paper money in his hand . He went over to Elijah . Huddlestone backed away , his face rigid and his eyes bright . Dan caught his right arm and held it ; Hud struck , blindly and quickly , at Dan 's face . . . Bale caught both the man 's wrists in the trap of his big hand and held him , in spite of his writhings . He pushed the fold of money into his pocket . He said , " Are we friends , or are we not ? " He dropped Elijah 's wrists . Hud breathed rapidly and stared at the floor . " Oh , now  --  " said Dan . " How much was that ? " " I do n't know . I have n't the faintest idea . You know what Doc always says : money , it 's the curse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devilment , or something like that . " " I ca n't take your money , Dan . " Bale said a short word . He sat down on the bed . " I can not . You should be able to understand . " Dan sneered , " Because I 'm a Copperhead ? Because I 'm a coward who wo n't go out and kill for the sake of the StarSpangledBanner and Father Abraham and General D. N. Couch and the Army of the Susquehanna ? " " That 's not it . But  --  you 're drunk and  --  " " Not that drunk . I know what I 'm about . . . Go away , and quit driving me to distraction . " He lay back on the bed , closing his eyes and putting his hand over them to keep out the tawny glare of the lamp . Elijah shuffled around on the matting at the door . " All right , " he said , finally . " A loan , then . Until I come back . Will I see you tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He heard reluctant feet going away down the stairs . He lay there on the bed and wondered whether he should take more whiskey ... ho , the wars ! " Doubtless , " he said aloud to the echoing room . Then he blew out . the lamp and lay down once more . Wondering , murmuring darkness . Before morning he dreamed of Doctor Duffey and Elijah going to war in the carryall . Their old white horse was shot ; he stood still in the shafts , trembling and dying by inches . " Is n't there something you can do for him ? " Elijah kept appealing . " Poor old Salt ! Poor old ReverendSolt ... "  |p129He  came back into the world when everything was grayish-pink and a thousand birds haunted across the fields . Their immutable warbling rippled through the room . He went to the window and looked out at a layer of mist which lifted from meadows across the road . . . This life must be shed . Mrs. Wurke would be home all too soon ; then he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dan sponged his head and shoulders , put on a clean shirt , and went out to the well . A mirror of orange was liftingin the east ; the belated and sleepy roosters in Fannings ' barnyard were wailing about it . Dan went into the cool kitchen and hunted until he found a willow basket . In it he packed the remainder of the cheese , half a loaf of dry wheat-bread , butter , a knife , and a jar of quince preserves . One of the Germels boys had left a pail of milk in the little buttery off the back porch ; the milk appeared mysteriously each night ; you left an empty bucket and a bit of fractional currency on the wide green shelf , and miraculously the milk would be there in the morning , as if elves had brought it .. . Dan washed an empty wine bottle brought from the pantry , filled it with a pint of milk , and plugged the top with a roll of newspaper . He put Coleridge into the basket , and a late book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been bought by Pentland Bale during his last illness . He put in a slab of writing paper and a lead pencil , then took them out again : no , he could never be one with the dainty souls who sat themselves down in clovery dales and poured out their souls amid the murmur of thrushes . If he had anything to give the world , it would bear itself through a less beautiful travail ... The doors stood open behind him . He walked south across the pasture , carrying the basket . He looked at the Fanning house . It was a cube , lifeless , a desolate rock laden with old vines . The chickens gabbled shrilly , telling him.  |p130From  the Fairfield road he went south opposite Long Lane . The sun pushed above Granite Ridge and shone on a dwarf in Henry Niede 's barnyard , and animal dwarfs over west at the McMillen farm . . . He stepped among the spongy hummocks which give birth to Stevens Run . Thick woods , south past the Bliss place ; the birds were busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smother of plumed trees . Blue haze made a million dimples between the puffy foliage . Green lilac tufts , he thought . . . the trees bring peace , but somehow it hurts you to look at them too long . At one o'clock he finished his bottle of milk and ate the last of the toast he had browned over a wood fire . He picked his way down the west slope of Little Round Top , sliding among the great bowlders with the basket on his arm . He washed at Plum Run and wandered east through the gulley to the Taneytown road . . . Green silence : he came out into the narrow lane , and a woman on a bay horse was bobbing toward him from the north . She was Mrs. Tyler Fanning ; she rode a colt which had been trained as the elder Fanning 's saddle-horse . It trotted gingerly , wondering about this side-saddle , its ears stiff and pointed . . . The woman held her face high ; she came forward in metal dignity , and her lips were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hat was in her hand ; the dust lay like flour on every fold of her garments . Before this , she must have been galloping hard . The colt breathed too fast , and his bridle was gray with suds . Bale stepped into the grass beside the road and put his basket down . " It 's a good day to ride , " he said . The colt skated away through the dust , but the girl brought him back . She did not look at Dan Bale , but farp131beyond him . " I do n't know what to say to you . " She spoke harshly . " If you were me , would you know what to say ? Please do not tell me that it 's a good day to ride  --  " Their eyes met and clung coldly together . " If you 'll get down , " he suggested , " we might walk a bit . You can tie the colt or lead him , just as you choose .. . He 's a good one . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  --  " She said , " Dazzle . His name is Dazzle . " They muttered together : whoa , hold on , Dazzle , good boy , Daz  --  Bale grasped the bridle ; the girl rested her hand upon his shoulder as she lifted her knee , shook out the wide skirt , and slipped to the ground . She seemed very small beside the tall young horse . . . There were tiny lines drawn in soft spokes around her eyes . " He 'll behave , tied , " she said to Dan , " if the flies do n't annoy him too much . Do you put him over there in the shade . " Dan unsnapped the reins and knotted them together for an extended halter . " There , " he said , " he can get his head down if he wants any grass . " He tied the leather around a peak at the fence angle . . . He could feel blood in his wrists and temples pounding with the jarring spasm of pebbles  --  clots of pebbles moving through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought . They feel gray . Her face is like it was when Tyler yelped at her , that other afternoon . There is still a bandage on her arm , to remind me . He offered his arm . She took it in a stiff clutch . They walked down the road ; she was holding the long riding skirt by its braided loop , and the shadows of their bodies dissolved in a grotesque pool beside them . " You despise me , " Dan said . " Probably it 's natural that you should . " " Natural ? " she repeated , as if she were very tired . He tried to speak without emotion . " I was the aggres- sor . Whatever wrong has been managed , you can charge against me . " " I have tried to charge you with a great many things , " the girl said , " but  --  I 've been so hideously mixed up , body and soul . " He halted , and seized her hands . " If you knew how I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a brief , hopeless pleading . " Mr. Bale , are you going to tell me of your great love for me ? " " It may be that . I do n't know . You 've been with me  --  my mind , ever since . And before . " She went on , dully : " You tried to fling me out of your mind , and failed . That is a greater compliment than I could have expected . " They were walking again . " And because you are a gentleman  --  a sensitive one  --  your conscience has been active . If you are a Christian , you may consider both of us utterly damned , and hate me for it . " " That 's not true . Not a word of it . " He swore softly . " I wonder , " Irene Fanning said . Her eyes lifted , holding a steady question . Beneath the shade of the big beech tree , Dazzle nickered inquisitively . A slow rumble of wheels came in a rising echo , not far up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We must not be seen here , Mr. Bale . Not this way . At least no one knows about  --  about  --  No one else . " " They 'll see the horse . " " I could have left him tied  --  and gone for a stroll  --  " " In here , " he whispered quickly . He pushed the branches of elderberry aside , opening a tunnel into the thick shrubbery . The woman crowded through ; Bale followed , drawing the green leaves together . There was a low ditch behind the matted bulwark ; clover hay grew tall and unclipped , spilling past the broken bars of a fence . The approaching wagon joggled closer . " Down , " the man whispered . He drew herp133into the cushioned jungle of hay ; her throat was hot against his wrist . The wheels and hoofs stopped for a moment as the driver paused to gaze at the bay colt . Then the vehicle creaked again ; it rolled past the elderberry ambush , a rusty team , a faded old Stanhope with the bearded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truckenmiller again  --  I would have thought him too shaky to drive alone . ... The wheels muttered out of hearing . Dan whispered , " Das Alter wdgt , die Jugend wagt . " " What ? " she asked . " Youth ventures  --  starts ahead  --  while old age considers . That villain of a Truckenmiller  --  he quoted it in town yes-terday . " She said , " We must  --  " and made as if to rise . He fastened his arms around her body , and drew her down . He kissed her roughly , again and again ... Her lips trembled against his neck . " Oh , I 'm mad , " she sobbed . " I love you , Irene . I  --  " " Not  --  not  --  " " I know it is . I ca n't forget . " The colt neighed and stamped , annoyed with waiting . Irene said , " I must  --  go . Dazzle ... he 's fractious ; he 'll break loose ! And here we  --  Like this  --  " He crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried weakly . " Darling , darling ! Oh , God , I feel like a strumpet . It never was like this before ! " He said , " Not another flicker of time ... nothing but you " The world will  --  kill us , for this . . . Outraged  --  " He lifted her body close beside his ; on their knees they faced each other in the reeling shade . " You 'll divorce Fanning , " Dan cried . " You 've got to do it . You do n't love him . We 'll go west at once . Cut loose from Gettysburg , from  --  Oh , my beloved  --  " the words poured from him , inexhaustiblep134fund , he could go on saying these things to her , day after day without end  --  " think what it will be ! Casting everything else  --  " " You do n't know me . Only this sin we 've done  --  " " Call it sin . God knows it 's beautiful . " She groaned , " Oh , I 'm shameless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " She shuddered , and closed her eyes . She struck fiercely against his chest . " We must go , at once . " " Tonight , " he said . " My dear , tonight  --  " They stood up . She brushed blindly at the netted branches . " It 's too terrible  --  that way . Because I leave the house , with both of them there  --  I feel like a thief , or a murderer , or  --  Since Sunday I 've lain in my room , pretending to read , trying to think . It 's as if the world had been cracked , far and wide , and I was afraid to step outside for fear I 'd sink through . " " Listen , " he said . " Dear , can you listen ? I 'll buy a good team today . We 'll go away  --  tonight . I can draw a thousand dollars out of the bank at once , if need be . We need not come back ; everything can be settled , later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , that is childish . And I would never do such a thing to Tyler and his parents , no matter how little love I bear them . No  --  we must consider , for a long time . " " You doubt me . You do n't believe  --  " " I doubt myself  --  Dan . " Her face flushed lightly as she said the word . It was as if in speaking his name , sanely and in no great stress of passion , she had committed herself to a greater intimacy than ever before . They went back to the colt . He had trampled about and got one leg over the line by which he was hitched . He squealed and arched his neck when they came near him . " He 's good , " Bale heard himself saying . " Got a lot of daylightunder him , and a rather steep rump , but he 's a rare breedy stamp . "  | " Mr. Fanning bought him in Emmetsburg ; " Irene said . " Please hold Dazzle close to the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided her into the saddle , Bale still held the colt 's bit . He curried at the shining neck with stiff fingers . " Tonight . . .

It 's farther from the line , and her relatives are terrifiedat the thought of invasion . She 'll be glad to go . " " Do n't do that , " Irene commanded , sharply . . . She cried , " Oh , my hat  --  I did have one . " Dan went back to the thicket and found the little felt hat with its white feather , a crushed morsel in the clover . The woman took it in her hand , and bowed . " Irene , " he said . " Goodbye  --  Dan . " She whirled the bay ; he danced high on his hindlegs , shook his head , and blew a relieved snort from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frantic lope . . . Mrs. Fanning did not look back , but gave her full attention to holding Dazzle . Bale went down the shady row to pick up his basket . He thought , Now that any peace is irretrievably gone , I could never wish it back . So hardy and alive ; sensitive to this leaf and that pool of sunlight , hearing all sounds ... who would believe that adultery was like this , like this ? He thought , Tyler Fanning  --  I 'll pity him from now until Doomsday , but I can never hate him . Likely enough he 'll be past hating me . I 'd fight for her , yes , I would even kill for her if I had to . This is not the same ravine through which I walked an hour ago ; I have never seen it before . . . And get rid of Mrs. Wurke , poor creature . Give her money ; send her away ; get rid of her ; there must be no interference , no intrusionupon my woman and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team  --  if I could persuade Irene to leave with me tonight  --  walk out of this trivial existence , shed all memories , and never dwell in the past again . He left it all behind him : the rock-skulled hills , the timbered dens , the thickets of Plum Run gorge where catbirdsmeowed and peeked at him . A thousand steps : pace , pace , pace again : and he was not conscious of having driven his body up the fields . When he came to the Emmetsburg road by Sherfys ' peach orchard , a dust cloud was moving from the southwest . It resolved itself into flashing spokes , lacquered staves , a black gelding  --  all the panoply of a gay cut-under buggy driven by Elijah Huddlestone . Dan stepped aside as the rig sped toward him , but Elijah whistled , and drew on the reins . Amelia Niede sat on the seat with him , and her white muslin dress was well sprinkled with dust . Again she wore the hat with painted strawberries , and patches of rose were smothered in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first kiss he had ever given her ... If he went to the war , he might come back an officer . Officers were men of importance ; in some magnificent way they acquired manners and property and short beards , and people spoke to them with deference ; not even Henry Niede could look with contempt at an officer . . . There was something the matter with Elijah , with Elijah 's private parts . People whispered , " He has a rup-t ure , " but like enough that would never interfere with him , in war ... If Elijah became an officer with lapels of blue-black plush , they would be married at the Lutheran church , and live in the village , and never again would Amelia have to milk six cows . They would have their pictures made , she and Elijah ; he would sit in a chair , knees crossed , and she would stand beside him , and the photographer would tint their faces pink . She squeezed her bony fingers closer together . Elijah yelled . " I 'm hustling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now . You climb in with us , Dan . " " No , " Bale said , " I 'll walk home across the fields ... I 've been picnicking in solitary contentment . " " You look like it agreed with you , I must say . See here : remember I told you last night that we 'd get at least fifty fellows from Penn college ? Well , there 's fifty-seven already signed the roll ! " He waved the tasseled whip ; his eyes were open wide , and he wore an immense stock which seemed ready to garrote him . " The major says we 're apt to leave for Harrisburg any minute , once he gets permission for the existing emergency ' enlistments . I tell you , Dan , the country 's full of rebels ! They 're pouring into Maryland like flies ; the Star and Banner'sbeen posting bulletins all day . Some folks say it 's only rumors ; I do n't believe it . They 're holding mass-meetings in Philadelphia , and Governor Curtin 's ordering cannon from  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan ordered . " I 'm acting as temporary sergeant . We 'll drill tonight , if nothing happens before then ... see you ! " he called , and then they went flashing off , wound iii the hot smoke of the road . Dan stood in the grass , waiting until the dust had settled . Yes , he said  --  yes , they say there is a war off there behind South Mountain , behind the rolls of forest . . . quickly , quickly I will bind myself against you , will feel you beating upon me like a hot heart , hear the breath shiver out of your mouth , and it is all surfeited with a power which we never knew existed before . . . war , behind blue hills over there . Slaty rivers of men pouring up the roads where we 've never walked . Elijah says so . When he reached his house , there was a folded sheet of paper tacked against the mosquito-frame door . On one side was printed in soiled black type : will guarantee colt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no such guarantee at Terms To Be Arranged . On the other side was written in blunt lead pencil , " The mother stille not so well , and Aunt Emma to stay until knows what the army do . Respy , H. Wurke . " As Dan read the note , he felt a blind fever of passion climbing in his brain . Mrs. Wurke would not return from Mummasburg this day ; God knew when she would come . Until knows what the army do .. . He went inside , to exist , to drag out the monotonous ages until night . He lay down ; he could not sleep ; he could only crave the ultimate hour . A bugle ta-ta-taed far away , every few minutes , and the hazy Pike was thunderous with wagons . Mrs. Knouse had locked herself in her little brick house , tulip bulbs and all ; she peered from narrow cracks behind her shutters , watching for screaming hordes of rebels who would come to uproot her flower garden . Elijah Huddlestone was sworn to the service of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; he did not see Elijah before the volunteers went clamoring off to Harrisburg , waving their shabbiest hats and howlingSam built the wagon , The old Union wagon  --  The star-crested wagon  --  To give the boys a ride ... The younger boys sang in quartets , their arms locked around one another : No more ciphers , no more books , no more master 's cranky looks ... Bart McKosh and Ernie Dryer and old John Burns were left behind ... The recruits reached Harrisburg in a steady rain , and had to wait in the downpour for hours , and they wondered if this was war . Monday evening a troop of independent cavalry from Two Taverns came clattering into Gettysburg to report to Major Haller . They were farm boys , mostly  --  mounted on shaggy farm horses which squealed at all the clanking andp139hullabaloo around them . . . All day , piled-up wagons of refugees had been grinding in from Fairfield , from Greenwoodand the hills beyond . The drivers crouched in voluble terror , staring wildly over their shoulders at the rainy horizonbehind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Hagerstown . Johannes Merckenburg saw them ; Frederick Sturtz had a sister living there , who had sent him word . Mrs. Henry Kreck had fled from their wrath , with her five childrenpacked in a New Rochelle wagon ; she had driven all night , and one of the children sick with scarlet fever . . . Ja , there was a terrible old general with one leg , who had stolen a fine brougham somewhere ; he drove with his good leg propped on the seat before him , and only the idiots of the countryside would stay to be eaten alive . Soldiers spread out on every road , they spotted the pastures with their fires , they burned Adolph Schilling 's fences , they took every horse from the Hamms . Ach , they would pay , but their great rolls of dingy paper were not money . The wild men with long hair , the men who talked as no human beings had ever talked , were dark and patched and very , very hungry . Chickens disappeared ; you heard them squawking horridly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who was it said that those men with long hair had eaten a baby or two ? Ja , it was all too true ; they had eaten children ; it was known .. . They seized upon Otto Roush 's new wagon , and took it away with them . They sang satanic songs ; the pigs squealed for mercy , and were butchered in every farmyard . Many children they had eaten ; only the fools would stay . Army after army came clanking in from the south , and cowardly folks ran out to give them coffee and gingerbread , and to cheer at the dirty pink flags they carried . They cut the ears from pretty girls ; they strung the ears like beads and hung them around their necks . Ach , it is a terrible thing which happens to a young woman who is caught by them , all alone . . . Nein , I have not seen it myself , but it is true . A hundred of those men will carry her away into the forest ; she will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ears . Tuesday the wagons still came . You saw the dried , snuffy faces of old women peering down ; white-haired children bawled , their noses ran and were not wiped clean . Kittens spilled out of peach baskets , and were left to yowl in the mud behind . There were runaways . . . Wagons , wagons through the turnpike gates , wallowing in from the west . Chambersburg had been seized again by hosts , by gaunt thousands ... And Wednesday , the procession still came . The heavy-hoofed cavalry from Two Taverns had splashed away up the Harrisburg road : men cried at them , Verrickt ! and go once the other way , for that is where the rebels come . It was after dusk on Thursday evening , and Dan Bale was , walking out of Pock 's store with a sack of groceries under his arm , when he heard the faint squeal of a fife . Loafers who had clustered under the buckeye trees were moving across the Diamond and peering down the black tunnel of York street . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll , and behind this tuneless murmur was a weary drone of cheering . Lanterns began to drift out of dark houses . The word passed from square to square : our boys , people said . It 's the milishy . There were more than a hundred of them . They straggledinto the Diamond in a shambling file with the lanterns of townspeople leading them on . An officer whom no one had ever seen before , was marching ahead ; he kept swinging around , limping backward , staring down the indefinite line . " Close up , men , " he entreated . " This is n't any picnic , just because some of you have sweethearts watching . " People werep141calling from windows , from doorways ; the drums and the fife cut their medley short . " Close up , close up ! Raaat ob-leek ... " The dim figures stumbled , closed a few ragged gaps . " Ult ! . . To the left  --  uss ! " Yellow lanterns got in the way . So many of the soldiers seemed thin and stooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kommm-pahneee ... " His command of dismissal rose high above the suddenhum of conversation . The officer added , " Men . Remain within call . Do n't leave this town square without permission . " He walked wearily toward the lights of the hotel , holding up his sword scabbard as if the weight were too much for him . Dan watched one figure , much taller than the rest , detachitself from the crowd . He went forward hesitantly , with the groceries still under his arm . He asked , " Elijah ? " " Yes ; " a cracked voice said . Hud loomed in front of him ; he seemed like an amazingly thin , long-legged monkey , trained for bizarre pranks , with the little cap cocked tightly over one ear . They shook hands . " What 's all this ? We did n't expect you back this soon . " Huddlestone explained , " We were ordered here from Harrisburg . The rest of the regiment 's out at Swift Run , but we fellows moved on tonight . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They 've put our set in with about seven hundred more . We 're the Twenty-sixth , now . The Gettysburg boys make up Company A ... The train got off the track at Swift Run ; I should n't wonder if it was the doings of Copperheads . " " Was anyone hurt ? " " Not to notice . The balance of the Twenty-sixth will be here in the morning . " Dan asked , " What 's the matter with your voice ? " " Matter with it ? I do n't know  --  drilling , like as not.  | We 've been having the devil 's own time : muster was n't completeduntil Monday , and we left Harrisburg yesterday , to feel out the rebels over west . " " You mean  --  " It was impossible ; a patently childish design which had somehow found its way into the affairs of war . " You mean that your regiment had only two days of training , and now you 're going against the  --  enemy ? " Elijah thudded his musket upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  most of Company A  --  has been drilling for months . Of course , some of the rest  --  " They stood there , mute blots of darkness , staring through the gloom . " Can you stop out at the house with me and have a bite to eat ? " Bale asked . " We 'll get up a bottle of sherry  --  " " No , I 'm sorry . If I can get leave , I 'll go over home to see Ma . I do n't suppose Mealy is in town . " " You could drive out there , " Dan said , " but they 'd all be a-bed . " " Probably . Well , she 'll probably hear about us and come in , in the morning . I do n't know how soon we 'll move out of town  --  not till the rest of the regiment gets here . " Again they shook hands . Dan left Huddlestone in front of the grocery store ; in the wan light of the windows he could see that Elijah 's uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wore a broad splash of chevrons on his sleeve . " You 're a sergeant ? " " Well , the men think so . " Hud 's drooping mustache twitched ; he seemed leering as he grinned . " Goodnight , Dan . Get down early in the morning ; we may march before very late . " Under the direction of a bearded officer , squads of the tired men were trying to stack arms in front of the shop platforms . The muskets kept sliding down with a bristling clatter . " No . No ! " the lieutenant was growling . " Hook eachp143over each . Like this . You , there , private  --  hold yours . Now you lean yours on . Now  --  you . " Bale could hear the clinking and thud of their guns , hear the hollowness of spoken words , all the way to the little bridge over Stevens Run . The night-barking dog on McPherson 's ridge was makingno sound ; perhaps he had been housed and muzzled against the fear of a raiding enemy . Now Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The few stars looked flat and swaddled by wet clouds , and the moon was only a vague sickle beneath them . Somewhere at the end of this road were other men with muskets ; no one would have to direct their armament . . . Silently , he went into his broodinghouse . He felt oppressed by monstrous desolation . The Fanning place showed no gleam of light ; it might have been swallowed in a thousand miles of steppes . And nineteen hours before , Bale and the woman had agreed that they would not be together this night ... He sat on the couch in the black living room . In that space , their wrapped bodies had lain . He felt the inevitable , prickling surge of remembrance . . . her hair in his mouth , the smell of her clothes . His throat made a rough sound . After he had gone to bed , his nervous brain kept leapingabout , centering on Elijah in broad chevrons , Elijah with a pancake cap , frightened school-boys trying to stack arms , a captain who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed : Lucas Mite walked through the dry prairie grass of autumn , through deep blue-stem , with a gun in his hands . Dan could see Mite 's face as clearly as he had ever seen it : rusty beard , the big-pored nostrils , the sad gray eyes so level and cool . Mite was hunting for prairie chickens , the birds cheeped about in dry tangles underfoot , you could never find them . . . Lower , he bent , lower  --  pointing his shotgun this way and that . Then , without one shiver of warning , a wall of spectral cripples in new uniforms had risen up all around him . They opened their mouths ; they said nothing ; they blinked blind , white eyes . . . And from this dream , half roused by the wailing cry he made and coasting into deep forgetfulness again , Dan did not awake until the next day . The sky was bulging with gray clouds . Children 's voices soared with the common shrilling of startled poultry , but beyond their murmur was the dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bale leaped out of bed and to the window . Through the motionless elms he could see a broad , purplish tide coming up the road ; splotches of faces above the deep color , mingling , bobbing , row after row . He had not intended to sleep like that . Sleepless nights , hours of passion , the . eternities of brooding had worn him down . Now there were a hundred things which he must do , distressing tasks he must complete ; he had a sickening notion that there was something concerning Elijah Huddlestone and all the rest , which only he could arrange . . . He snapped his suspenders over his shoulders , cursed monotonously as he forced his naked feet into his boots . He ran down the stairs . The head df the column was passing as he reached the front fence ; bare-calved boys scampered alongside , wheeling their arms in circles , screeching . " You blame kids skeedaddleback to town , now , " a youth 's voice shouted . " Want that the rebels should get you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , trying to keep step . . . why do they have to carry so much with them ? Tall knapsacks , stuffed and enormous ; the sausages of blankets ; canteens , pouches , belts , bayonet scabbards rattling , a multitude of seminarians and lame men and old men , all trying to keep step , like burdenedpeddlers in their chafing uniforms . " I Ind ! " he called . This must be Company A ; there was old man Gubbe , but a few years younger than John Burns , trying to measure his pace with the college students . They carried their muskets like hoes and brooms and buggy whips , every which way : shouldered , sloped , hung by the slings . Pink face , wax face , the gnome face of a lawyer 's clerk  --  Al/mighty God , it was that lad who 'd read law with Julius Orcutt , and he had a club foot  --  they were letting him go . This was all nightmare , a nightmare worm which marched in the morning on fifteen hundred feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He waved his musket . " Good luck , " Bale heard himself rasping . So new , right off the shelves  --  their dark clothes . The hard leather belts squeaked and whined , stiffness reluctant to go out of them . Pink face , stubble face , gnome head all turning , twitching around . The boys began to call under their breath , the snub-nosed , the crazy young . . . that fellow Bale . Yep , where 's his gun ? Oh , he left it out west ; fightin ' Indians . Somebody hooted , clapping his hand against his mouth : owwowwowwow . " Silence in the ranks ! " howled Elijah . The laughter sighed down ; only a titter now , a mumble of shoes over the damp macadam . Company B , Company C . . . he did n't know them . He turned and walked back into the house . The little boys were returning down the slope , pointing their sticks at every tree and bush . Bang ! Bang ! A throng of women stood far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown against the hazy foliage . A bell at the seminary began to ring . Long after they were gone , Dan imagined that he could hear the mumble of their march past the door , hear the grayhairedofficers chantingat them . . . He washed , dressed himself for the day , and went to build a fire in the kitchen stove . It was far into the forenoon ; he had slept like a sot . He ate , listlessly . The hours trembled by . He picked up his hat . Go to town for tobacco . . . yes , bacon . He 'd forgottenso many things , the evening before . This day was darker and darker , a lead casket shaped around the world , and when he stopped to turn up his coat collar against the gray drizzle , it seemed as if he could hear the sound of firing . He leaned beside the gate , listening . Five minutes . Ten ... Maybe it was thunder , a reluctant spasm of the rain-clouds . Still , it had come to his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Diamond . The roads were empty of refugees ; no high-piled wagons in sight . Clinkhofers ' grandchildrenplayed quietly , cradling dolls in a Boston rocker on the deep porch . Bye oh bye oh bye , the white-braidedeldestgirl sang , a tuneless rhythm thrown out by the plasteredwall . And Mrs. McBride was calling across the road to some other neighbor , " Yes . Then you just beat it up with two eggs , but be sure you take out the yelks first . " The red bricks and board canopies of the business section sent back the mighty echoes of his footsteps , an accusing slap , slap like spanking hands . There were only six rigs in the entire Diamond . Everyone seemed to be hidden away . Julius Orcutt met him as he mounted the step in front of the grocery . " It 's coming close , Daniel , " he said . Bale nodded . The lawyer had a brown paper envelope in his hands . He was mutilating a loose corner of it between his thumb and first finger . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southrons attack them  --  " " It 's murder ! " Dan cried . " God damn it , what are peoplethinking of ? " Orcutt drew in his chin . " They 're thinking of our great country , Dan  --  that 's what they are thinking of ! Would that you 'd think of it , too . " " You go to hell , " Dan said . He stopped , knotted his fists , and then went into the store . Five men were looking at him ; they had heard what passed outside . Mr. Pock sidled nervously from behind the counter . " Something ? " he trilled . " Yes , tobacco . I want a pound of bacon ... no , two pounds . Your medium-best coffee : the small size sack . Sulphur matches " . . . the group of customers pushed close together . One of the men whispered a word or two . " Correct ! " someonesaid explosively.  |p147Bale  went outside , carrying his purchases in a broken wooden box . Orcutt was standing beside one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry , " Dan said . The lawyer put his loose hand on Dan 's sleeve . " We have always been friends . Pentland Bale and I  --  These are parlous times . A man speaks in wrath , and does not know why . " " Do n't think the worst of me . " " I sha n't , Daniel , I sha n't . I know that you are not one with those  --  those  --  " He gulped , touched his hat , and went away up the hollowed stairs to his office . People were in the road by the turnpike gate again , heedless of the rain , crowding expectantly around a ten-yearoldboy who sat on a folded scrap of blanket , astride an old white mare . Face after face turned toward Bale as he came forward , then all twisted back once more . " Your Pa send you , Roger ? " rose out of the buzzing . The child on the horse , nodded . His face was frightening  --  hislips were so utterly bloodless . Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news ? " She bobbed an affirmative . " Yes , they struck against the enemy out by Marsh Crick . This is Ed Striger 's boy , he brung the word , just now . " " What happened ? " " Our boys give way . Up toward Mummasburg . They went north with most of the rebels after ' em , Roger says . " The boy repeated , " There was a lot of shooting . A lot . Ma and Aunt Kate got down in our cellar . Pa 's layed up with ague , but he said I should ride to town and tell folks . " The town council , people said . Yes . He ought to go right down to Mr. Kendlehart and Mr. Orcutt and the rest . The white mare stood sadly , head bent and tail all knotty with burrs . As Dan went on toward his house , he could look back and see the crowd scattering , as if moved by an horrific impulse , and never intending to gather again . . . No more sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the echo of thunder . Perhaps Elijah was killed . " No , " he said aloud . He walked into the dim kitchen and thumped his grocerybox upon the table . Dan ... oh , Dan . It was a ghastly whisper . He thought for a moment that some wraith had cried aloud inside his ears , a baleful ghost which would tormenthim forever . Dan .. . Dan ! It was in the buttery . He stumbled across and flung open the door . Two faces stared out of the dimness , the smells of sour milk and cold eggs . Elijah , and some face he did not know . Huddlestone was lying on the floor ; the other man squatted against the wall with a gun in his hands . " Christ , " Bale said . Elijah smiled feebly . His chin was dirty with powder ; it looked as if his mustache had melted and run . " We just scooted in here a minute ago . You were gone . We 've been running like all hell , through the woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " Dan dropped to his knees . " You 're wounded ? Hurt ? " " I 've just got an awful gut-ache , from hurrying so ... This is Fisher . He 's from here ; Penn college . We got cut off . " He took a deep , shivering breath . " Ran into them , three or four miles out . God , " he sobbed suddenly , anguished and bitter , " you ought to see them ! We have n't got any soldiers like those . " " Is anyone killed ? " The Fisher boy nodded . " Guess so . It all happened so quick . The regiment retreated up toward Whitmers ' farm , with most of the rebs chasing them . Those gray sons a ' bitches gobbled up most of Company B. The boys were yelling I surrender , I surrender , I wo n't shoot , you got us . It was terrible . Huddlestone and I got chased off , over past some bushes . " " We laid low , " Elijah gasped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw us , I guess . But the regiment'llbe dead or cut to pieces by night . " Dan cried , " Take off those uniforms , right away ! I 'll get you some other clothes . The rebels wo n't know , if they come  --  " Huddlestone shook his head . He grasped the two lower shelves on either side , and pulled himself up . He scraped around in the corner for his musket ; through all their flight he and Fisher had kept their guns and ammunition , though their other accoutrements were gone . " No . We thought they 'd be pushing us , but if they 're not in sight yet we 've still got a chance . " " A chance  --  ? " " We 'll get along south , towards Maryland . Our army 's down southeast of here somewhere ; they ca n't be sitting in Virginia all this time . Maybe we can find them , instead of getting caught . No use in our going towards Harrisburg ; the Butternuts will be all over north of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I said we 'd rather die than go to a prison pen . " Dan said , " Now , be sensible . You 'll die if you keep running around the country this way  --  " Elijah 's teeth showed in a snarl . " Come on , Tom Fisher ! " He leaned heavily against the door casing . " Wait a minute , " Dan ordered . " Stay here . " He ran through the house and out to the front gate . The r " of the western hill was smooth , unpeopled . He went bac o the fugitives . " Come on , " he said . " Let 's get over to F ings ' . You 'll never reach Maryland on foot , not if the Conf erates are close behind you . " The drizzle had ceased , but clouds still blocked close above the trees , humid and oppressive . The three men climbed over the pasture fence . Huddlestone 's face was green and drawn ; he moved as if his joints were grating together , and the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm under Elijah 's arm-pits , and half lifted him along the twisting path . " I 'm all right , " Hud kept sighing . " Let me alone . Damn it ! I can get along  --  " Fisher trotted ahead , carrying the two muskets . Cybo lunged at them , pink-eyed , barking . They kicked him out of the way . " In here , " Bale directed . " This is the cob-shed . Lie low for a minute . " He raced up to the rear stoop and pounded upon the door jamb . " Mrs. Fanning ! " he called . " She 's resting , " came Irene 's voice , tight and disbelieving . Then she appeared in the kitchen doorway , and slowly her hand crept against her mouth . . . She whispered , " Oh , come in  --  quickly ! Gretel 's gone to Spanglers ' . . . everyone 's gone except mother  --  " Inside , the startled shadows bending beside them , he fed on her mouth . " It 's a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her arms binding him for a moment . " But  --  here ? You must not  --  oh , Dan , you  --  " She whined in fright , falling away from him , and knowing suddenly that this was Tyler Fanning 's house . . . Tyler Fanning 's people all around  --  specters of her betrayal swooping closeBale pointed toward the barns . " The militia 's been scatteredby the rebels . They 're close  --  coming in along the Pike . Elijah and another fellow are hiding out there in the barn . There 's a chance for them to avoid capture by hustling south at once ; the main Federal army is on the way north , they think . . . Will Mrs. Fanning let them take a horse and any sort of a rig , and try it ? I 'll pay for it , if they are unsuccess-ful . " Irene said , " Of course . I 'll tell her . Of course they must n't be  --  " She caught up her gown and sped in to the front hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and there was an answering groan upstairs . The stairway echoed crazily as the woman 's pointed heels stabbed against it . Dan waited , trying not to look at the room around him . . . Ap151despoiler , he thought . I ca n't forget . In my house it is not the same . Here " The Jenny Lind . " The girl 's voice echoed down from the top of the stair-pit . " Mr. Bale , mother says for them to take the Jenny Lind . The top was broken when Demon had the runaway , but it rolls nicely still . It 's at the far end of the shed . . . Take the colt . He 's broke to harness , and the rebels will carry him off if they come to Gettysburg ... Father 's gone in the carriage , with Demon . " The ceiling quaked as Mrs. Fanning climbed from out 9f her bed . Dan called , " Very well . I 'm buying the colt , if anything goes wrong . Please tell her . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crack . Elijah sat on a saw-horse while Dan and Fisher rolled the broken Jenny Lind buggy from its deep ruts in the straw . They hunted savagely for single harness . Dan went into the stable run and led out the bay colt . Mrs. Fanning was standing at an upstairs window , wailing damply , a pink wrapper caught around her . " Father loves that colt ... he 's gentle . Even my daughter-in-law rides him . . . poor , poor boys ! And your dear mothers , they must feel  --  " Bale shoved Elijah into the splintered seat beside young Fisher , and handed their muskets to him . Elijah clasped the guns in his trembling hands . " Dan , I 'll get myself some of those devils yet . Chase us around the country this way  --  " They waved at the pink hulk in the upper window . The colt danced out of the driveway ; ungreased axles screeched withoutmercy . . . They went pitching south , and east again ; the wheels were throwing out a thin soup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove . Mrs. Fanning staggered back from the window . " They make me think of honey boy . What if he 'd be captured and court-martialed and  --  I ca n't stand it ! Dan , Dan ! " she cried , " Will you go down to the factory after father ? The Con-federates  --  coming  --  "  | " They 've heard the news downtown by this time , Mrs. Fanning . He 'll be here before long , I 'm sure  --  if not , I 'll look out for you until he comes . " He considered for a moment . " Perhaps it would be a good idea for you to hide your valuables . They say invading armies seize them : I do n't know . " Irene stood on the back stoop , twisting a handkerchief in her hands . " They 've been hidden since Monday , Mr. Bale . " Her face called , oh lover , it has been so long since the last realization  --  so many hours  --  yes , you know  --  you feel the separation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye out for you , until dark , " Dan said . " If Mr. Fanning does n't arrive soon , I will be back . " He strode through the wet weeds of the pasture . By the time he reached his own yard , he could hear a marvelous , sodden murmur beyondOak Ridge  --  the sound of a hundred and fifty wagons rumbling on a damp and rocky Pike . He went out through his gate and looked up the hill . In the low mist , a troop of cavalrymen loomed tremendously on the summit . Seen through the haze of wetness , they were spectral and Tartaric . More crowded there . . . More . He heard a yapping word of command ; a horse squealed ; then the herd began to pour down the long slope toward him . Resounding hoofs . . . He heard Mrs. Knouse cry out ; her door slammed , and she was moving things against it . BOOK THREETHE CHAMBERSBURG PIKE IRENE bundled Cybo into the cellar , shut the door , and came up to the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanning 's room , hear her windy groans , and the dull clanging of heavy chinaware as she leaned against the washstand . She was taking turpentine , a few drops in a spoonful of alcohol ; the treatment had been prescribed once long before when Mrs. Fanning suffered an internal hemorrhage , but still she persisted in inflaming her kidneys with it ... Spirits of turpentine came out into the hall , sweetish smell of invalidism , and now the whole upstairs was an apothecary'sshop . The girl turned away from the stairs . She had neither the courage nor the desire to go up and embrace Mrs. Fanning , moan sympathetically , touch her stuffed body with its hot , wet skin . She thought , " And she did let them have the colt and the Jenny Lind . Other people might not have let them . Maybe she would never have done it , if it had n't been for the thought of Tyler . " Irene went out on the porch and looked southeast across the sloping meadows . A wagon was moving south in Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon loaded with tiny gray and black dolls . At that distance , and in the gray haze , the heads of the dolls seemed disconnected from their bodies . She onderedidly why a human body seemed to come apart . hen viewed from a long way off . That was an uninterpreted analogy which she could not pursue  --  too remote and in- capable , she thought  --  suspended here on this high porch behind the budding trumpet vines . . . The wagon was moving slower , slower ; it stopped , and a doll went chasing back to pick up something which had fallen into the road . Then image and wagon blurred together once more ; the toy horses twinkled out of sight past a row of peach trees . Wheels hummed closer at hand . Mr. Fanning and Demon rioted up from the Fairfield road ; the mares rocked wildly and they were frightened , their coarse manes slapped in the wind . Demon was holding his arms stiffly extended as he grasped the reins . He had lost his hat . Irene ran to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . " Look out ! " she heard a woman 's thin voice screeching . " Becky 's tug strap  --  look out  --  " The team swayed aside and the front carriage wheel ripped through a lilac bush , broken branches whistling against the box . Becky and Bright stopped in their tracks , snorting and blowing ; the loose tug was trailing around Becky 's legs and she kept trampling it nervously . Mr. Fanning climbed down and labored across the damp lawn with a faded carpet-bag in his hand . The bag was heavy and he carried it clumsily . He did not look back at Demon and the tormented mares . " The rebels are  --  " She said , " Yes , yes ! Any moment . We know . . . I thought the team was running away . " " Where is mother ? " " Upstairs . " She tried to say , " Turpentine . She 's taking  --  " It was the first time she had ever seen Mr. Fanning when he looked untidy , with his waistcoat hanging open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This bag , " he muttered . " It 's from the factory . Papers and letters  --  my contracts  --  I have currency from the safe , more than seven hundred dollars , part gold . We must  --  " She nodded . " Give it to me . I will hide it . "  |p157He  took a deep breath , then pressed the handle decisivelywithin her grasp . He limped on into the hall , and she could see his white , delicate hand trembling as he rested it on the newel-post . " Mother , " he called , " I 'm coming  --  " and went up the stairs as rapidly as he could go . A sound was driving itself against the girl 's ears . As she looked across the mound of shrubbery beside the porch , she was positive that the poplar trees shimmered , the fences were blurry and titillating , all uprooted and quivered by the pulsationof the long ridge . Wagons and men , whip-snappings , some kind of struggling outcry and chatter , all minced by the stupendous turning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of sacked grain and gunpowder and corned-beef , an awful migration pushing its sound ahead . This could not be the invading army so soon , so soon . " Why , " she thought daintily , " they have n't given us time ! " The bag of papers and money weighed against her leg ; she imagined that she had Mr. Fanning 's whole factory , his past and present life and a good share of his future , all his assured comfort , there it was in her hand ready to be hidden . The barn . No , invading armies burned barns and haystacks . The house . . . Tyler had told her what happened to house after house in Virginia . Down in the ground , deep under a blanket of beetles and white roots , that was the place for burying . There was an abandoned well beneath a Baldwin tree , just across the driveway . Once , said Mrs. Fanning , it had been covered by a wooden platform , and Tyler had barely missed going to his death when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by two limestone slabs ; quack-grass wove a skein around them . The woman ran across the driveway and knelt beside the stones . The damp stain of grass was pushed through climity and muslin and silk , printed on her knee as she rested there . She clawed a sodden corner of ancient wood Irom beneath the left-hand slab and forced the flat bag through the opening . A little chorus of gravel and the dust of rotten wood went trickling down into mysterious water far below . With numb hands she wrenched off the wide sash around her waist and tied it to the handle of the carpet-bag . Half-hitch , half-hitch , half-hitch : it was the only knot she knew . She fastened an end of the sash to the wormy corner of hewn plank , and forced it back into place . . . Wet grass rubbed and gritted between her fingers as she tore up handfulsof it and strewed them around the corner of the well . Before this , she had removed the bandage from her arm  --  that long wound which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet  --  but it seemed that she was courtingsuppuration , rubbing pollution after pollution into the encrusted scar . At last she stood up , her gown all stained , and she looked at the well . " It 's safe , " she said , half aloud , " if they do n't become suspicious and begin to pry around . And if the planks do n't give way  --  " Past the barnyard , down the sloping road in front of Bales ' and Knouses ' , moved a thickening tide of men . Some have horses , Irene said to herself , and some have none . Long poles thrust up , muffled and wound with dun rags . I suppose those are their banners  --  covered because it 's rainy . Tyler calls them " colors cased . " Some have horses , some have none . She mumbled it over , again , again , as she moved up the driveway . It was like a counting-out game which she had played long before . How long ? Fifteen years ? Oh , the war had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t e **38;2474;TOOLONG o m **115;2514;TOOLONG . . . She heard Mr. Fanning cough , up in the open window ; he stood there staring at her and jerking his whiskers . " It 's hid , " she called . He murmured . inanely , " What ? What 's hid ... oh , yes  --  "  | " It 's hid in the old well . I tied it to my sash and let it down . " " They will see the sash , I fear . " " No , I covered it with grass and  --  and things . . . Look ! " she cried , " Past the barn  --  they  --  " He turned away . " Mother , " he said , and his voice seemed humble and fumbling , " mother , here are the rebels . You can see them ... I was assured that there would be no invasion . I told Tyler , in all confidence  --  " Then Mrs. Fanning was at the window beside him . His words , falling limply . " What did  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into the barn . " Demon , Demon , let the team be . Come in the house and hide . Oh , Bedford , and Gretel 's still at Spanglers ' or I do n't know where ! They took the colt , father ... no , the Huddlestone boy and  --  Demon , come insideThe old man shuffled out of the dim amphitheatre of the barn and stood in the wide doorway , blinking up at the window with his one eye . " Cay n't send me back to Mayland , " he said . " Mist Fanning , ' em rebel cay n't fotch me back to Mayland . I got Freedom Papeh in my bosom . Old Mist Capplehe give me Freedom Papeh long time ago , so ' em damn rebel cay n't make me slabery no mo ' . " Mrs. Fanning squealed . A small man on a wiry black horse leaped the pasture fence and came cantering up toward the yard . He swung carefully past the garden patch , his horse 's feet making clean , dark U 's along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on foot were scrambling over the fence . The mounted soldier wore a citizen 's coat of loose brown weave ; he had a revolver buckled around his waist , and a huge grain-sack tied behind his saddle . He took off his felt hat , and smiled . His teeth were small and even and yellow . There was a wispy fuzz of tawny beard on his chin ; perhaps he was eighteen years old . " Quattahmas/tah 's odduz ! " he announced . " Have yawl got any speh hosses , ma'am ? " The three men came hurrying across the garden , stumbling heedlessly through beans and beets . One of them reached down and jerked up a carrot ; he wiped it against his gray shirt and bit out a large , orange bite , and all as he ran ... They carried rifles slung over their shoulders , the butts chafing against their thighs . Mr. Fanning grasped the window ledge with both hands . He said , shrilly , " I have no horses to spare , sir . " Down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The youth bowed politely ; he looked toward Irene , and suddenly there was a silver spice in his narrow blue eyes . " Lacy , " he ordered , without turning his head , " look in the bahn . " Demon was waving something wadded and dirty in his hand . " Freedom Papeh ! Cay n't fotch me back to Mayland , Mist Rebel  --  " " Shut yo ' mouth , nig , " said one of the infantrymen . They pushed the old man out of the way and vanished into the stamping , scented blackness . . . Bright whickered with annoyance . The men came out , leading both horses . " Two mo ' old nags out in the field , Capting , " said one soldier . He ran a hand approvingly over Becky 's muzzle . The mare blew and jerked up her head . " Sho , " murmured the soldier . The young officer still held his shapeless hat on the pommel of his saddle . " Reckon theh five-yeh-olds ; yawl take ' cm along . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many now . " He fumbled in his coat pocket and drew out a fold of clamp paper . lie looked up at the window and saluted gravely . " Do you want I should write you an odduh , seh ? " Cybo 's yelping : row , row , row , row . Mrs. Fanning had disappeared . Irene could hear the reluctant sagging of the bed . . . and now the fat woman was lying down , trying to huddle deep in her sanctuary . She would want more tur-pentine  --   | " Will that order be honored in Confederate money ? " Mr. Fanning asked , slowly . " All sech items will be paid at a time subsequent to the establishment of the complete and undisputed independence of the Confederate States of America , seh , " the boy rattled . Mr. Fanning patted the window-sill hysterically . " No . No . I will never see that day , nor will you ! Take my horses , but please do not harm my household or my  --  " The rebel blushed angrily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . " We hahm no one , " he said , but he was looking at Irene as he said it . Once more he bowed ; he leaned forward in the saddle . The black gelding thudded across the yard . " Fetch ' em along , Lacy , " the captain called , waving his hat . The black skimmed the fence , up and over and down ; he loped away , twisting along the path which angled east below Knouse 's . The carrot-nibbling soldier ran ahead of his companions and opened the wide gate into the pasture , and closed it meticulously after they were through . Bright and Becky filed through the bushes , each ridden barebackby a soldier , with the third man bringing up the rear ; the mares were wrenching their necks and neighing at Demon . The old negro crouched beside the manure pile . He began to keen shrilly to himself . Take Bright and Becky to slabery . . . em damn rebel cay n't take Demon , but take my fine team . . . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . A tear coasted slowly alongside his flat nose . Mr. Fanning groaned from the window : " Daughter ! There 's no help for it . We should be thankful if they spare our home . Come into the house at once ; these are soldiers , my girl  --  enemies ! A woman  --  " " I know all that , " she said , drearily . " There are more troops over there in the road . Past the Bale house . I 'm  --  " she began to mumble , and she did not care whether he heard the words or not  --  " I am going over there and  --  ask Mr. Bale what to do , about the horses . Maybe we can get them back . Maybe he  --  " She reached the fence , bent her steel-skirt around her knees , and began to slide between the rails . My child he kept calling , come back at once ! She began to run , the rough green weeds slashing at her clothes . At that moment she did not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This car of war had come pushing through the hills , as in her nightmare thoughts : it was here , trundling down the Chambersburg Pike , and she had best see it as it came . She could not slump in a hot room which smelled of turpentine , and pray and sigh with aliens . Dan , she thought : I must be with him . I would rather be at his side . She looked back when she was nearly across the field , and she could see Mr. Fanning standing out on the kitchen stoop , waving his arms at her . Gone crazy , she said . He is sure that I 've become mad . And I have become mad , but not on this day . . . in this same field , and long ago , days and days and days . Two shabby , dark-eyed men were drinking water at the Bale well . Muddy haversacks and rolls of ragged blanket lay on the step behind them ; they wore their muskets slung , and the damp barrels gleamed softly . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somber , steady gaze at Irene as she hurriedpast . " Brothers , " she said to herself . " They look so very much alike . They look like pictures of Israelites in the wilderness . John the Baptist . . . some queer , unhappy prophets who carry guns as they go out to spread a peculiar gospel . But like enough they are cut-throats . " Then Dan Bale was beside her , and he had caught her hands . He said , " I 'm glad you came , " and she nodded politely , as if this were a party , a lawn social where her presence was expected and desired . He released her hands : the rebels might see . Twenty feet away , beyond the ivory fence , the armyp163moved in front of them . " Here 's more cavalry , " the man said in a matter-of-fact tone . " White 's cavalry , those men told me . Some more passed a few minutes ago . " They were boys , but no boys like those who had gone up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters released from a dun frieze which hung all along the rainy Pike . They owned flapping hats of shapeless felt , drawn low over their eyes ; their yellow faces were pinched and flat as the profiles on greasy coins . Boy and boy again  --  one with drenched fuzz on his cheeks , one with the hairless face of an Indian girl , long snarls of hair brushing their collars . They had been foaled to the saddles , they would ride in them until they died . And every cavalryman had the dull butt of a carbine thrusting up beside his leg ; they were weighted with revolvers , but few of them carried sabers . You could see embossed letters on holster flaps and saddle skirts as the troop jangled past . US ... again , US , and the men for whom those leathers had been stamped were trellising Virginia thickets with their bones . Behind these riders , the soaked macadam was forested with gray men and sloping muskets : they crunched up out of the hollow horizon and streamed down the hill past thig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a peculiar , swinging stride which was half a run . The western valleys were shaking with wagons . Lone officers drifted beside the column , mounted shepherds : they wore waterproofs , they wore wet yellow jackets or blue Union capes . Their eyes rested momentarily on Bale and the woman with him  --  flat , pin-pupiled , the eyes of men who had seen altogether too many things , and were concerned with secret contemplations which no one else could ever define . Sorrels , blacks , roans , chestnuts , a very few grays , the horses were painted with clay , and in some strange manner they had all become of the same shape and gait : they held their heads alike . A rout-step army , the noisy stretch of leather straining from buckle to buckle , loose shoes which rubbed and blisteredand made the wearers walk like lame men . Voices above the mutter of their marching . And Extra Billy 's brigade , they got no Pike up that way . . . town is this ? It 's Gettessbug . Says they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes ... stole them eggs at all . The lady made us a giff . A young boy 's chant , the key-bugle voice of one who had been a sophomoric orator at some drowsy academy : Backward , turn backward , 0 Time in yo ' flight , make me a child again just fo ' tonight . There was a rattle of laughter . Yeh , someone called , and a gal child at that " They took Becky and Bright , " Irene whispered . He said , " They rode out of the gate below Mrs. Knouse 's , a minute ago . . . I went out in the backyard when they first came by , but I could see Demon opening the stable door , and I knew that Mr. Fanning was home . Why did you come over here ? " She looked down at her knotted fingers . " Everything went to pieces suddenly . I hid  --  " she lowered her tone  --  " I hid a bag for Mr. Fanning , and the next minute those men were in the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some way  --  come over here , and stand beside you , and watch  --  " She looked up , and his face was pale under its brownness . " I did not do that , " he said . " You 'll have reason to doubt me . I should have remained with you , no matter how it made me feel ... I think of you , " and the trudging men tried to destroy his words with their canteen-clatter and multiplefootsteps , " I think of you all the time . I have no peace , and no wish for any . " He drew her back from the gate . Two men were beside them , the two sad Ishmaels who 'd been drinking at the well . " We 're obleeged , " one of them murmured . They began to pull their hats over their ragged manes as they went out to the road . A man called , " Major , what men are those ? " A group ofp165officers was working past the advancing infantry , legs of horses sliding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , and its rider nosed it in between the two soldiers and the marching , head-turning files . " What is your command ? " the officer snapped . He had the cragged forehead , the ascetic mouth of a religious warrior ; a Masonic ring glittered on one of his thin hands as they clenched the reins . " Taunton 's foot-scouts , seh  --  " The word went back to the other officers . " Taunton 's men , General . But they 've fallen behind . " " They should be beyond the head of the column , up with White . " You thought : here is one accustomed to speaking in courtrooms and political rallies . The voice seemed absurdly civil , rising out of this seasoned , tigerish horde . The general pushed close , past his jingling staff ; his thin horse had two white stockings under the plastered clay . " I am General Gordon . " He bowed to the woman and to Dan . " General John B. Gordon , of Early 's Division . Have my men been committing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bale said . " Not these men  --  they merely asked for a drink of water . But some of your foragers took my neighbor'scarriage horses . " His glance went from Irene , back to the Roman-faced general . Gordon had the eyes of a young judge who dreams of senates , who stands forever through his dreams decrying in measured sentences the rascality of a thousand Catilines . He took off his little cap with its splintered bill , and he bowed again . " Madam , I regret that the necessities of military strife call for the temporary acquisition of your property . Rest assured that not one man of the Army of Northern Virginia would appropriate a stick you own , were it not for the cruel exigencies of  --  " " Oh , go away ! " she cried . Gordon stopped short ; his sparse beard appeared to bristle . He turned his horse down the ditch . The staff officer with the Methodist face spurred quickly after him . Over his shoulder , the major called to the two wondering foot-scouts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bivouac ! " and then went on , jolt and squeak and rattle , with the hoofs of the general 's horse tossing wads of mud at him . The other officers saluted , bowed toward the gate , and racked behind . The girl said , rapidly , " I do n't know why I interrupted him . They were not my horses  --  they were the Fannings ' .. . I was very rude , was n't I ? Was n't I rude , Dan ? " she kept demanding . A thin laugh was shaking in her throat , and her lips were blue . He muttered , " Come . Come into the house , for pity 's sake . I 'll get you some wine . Oh , my dear , " he cried , " if I were able to stop this whole thing ! And we 've seen no horrors ; only the pageant , only  --  " Mr. Fanning came hurrying through the yard ; they could hear his gasping approach before he rounded the corner of the house . His shapeless pantaloons were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank heaven you are safe , girl ! I came for you as soon as I could leave mother . Gretel is back from Spanglers ' .

" Daniel , our administration has shown once and for all time , what it thinks of Pennsylvania . Permitting this  --  these  --  " Limply , he motioned toward the last company which shuffled along the road . . . The long approachingthunder was all around , now . " Wagons ! " Bedford Fanning cried . He kept kneading his blue-veined hands together . " Wagons by the score ! Look there  --  daughter , Daniel !  --  coming down the hill . They must have looted Chambersburgand Hagerstown of every last thing . And I have six thousand dollars ' worth of boots and leather in the factory ,  |p167this  very moment ! " His Adam 's apple was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Tyler knew  --  " Feverishly , he began to work his hands from pocket to pocket . " Tyler . . . ah , yes . The mail came . Somewhere I have letters . Two , from Tyler . They are marked on the same day , at Baltimore . Ah . " He brought them out , dog-eared oblongs . " One is addressed to you , daughter , and one to his mother and me . " " Thank you , " the girl said . She took the envelope ; she did not look at it ; the gray-topped wagons rumbled , and Mr. Fanning 's voice had crept up until it was a screech . Bale took his arm . " Did  --  Mrs.  --  Fanning  --  tell  --  you-colt  --  buggy ? " The man 's bald head bobbed crazily . " Yes , yes ! I do n't blame  --  " he cried . In the whole of creation , there was nothing but this crunching grind of wheels . " Perhaps even now , " he shouted in Dan 's ear , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken him , I 'd never  --  " " Hud and Fisher must be safe . Did you see them turn off the Fairfield road as you came home ? " " No . I saw nothing . I  --  " " If they reached the Baltimore Pike before the rebels , they are safe . The Confederates are moving on Harrisburg ; I heard them talking about it . They 're not moving south from here . " Irene 's shoulders began to sag . She kept staring intently at Dan and at her father-in-law , even though her face was white . " I feel so strange , " Dan heard her say , " as if something inescapable had come to us  --  a car of war  --  some  --  " He brushed Mr. Fanning aside , and picked the woman up in his arms , and carried her quickly into the house . She did not faint ; she still kept looking at him , wide-eyed , and trying to master the jellying of her lips . " Feel so strange , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bale told Mr. Fanning . He pushed open the library door and brought the girl inside ; he could hear the older man limpingout to the kitchen , opening a door , pawing among sacks and bottles . Dan whispered fiercely : " Dear . Dear . You 've got to get hold of yourself . You can not do this . You  --  " She nodded . He held her on the smooth cherry-wood settee , with Pentland Bale 's portrait glaring up above . " It was  --  Tyler 's letter . I feel as if  --  as  --  " She sobbed with hot breath , " I do n't love him . Oh , believe me , darling , I never loved him ! But I 'm sorry , sorry , sorry  --  " She took a deep breath , and closed her eyes . Mr. Fanning came in with sherry in a Willow cup . The wagons made all the window glass dance in its tight frames . There were still a few mounted men riding alongside the jumbled train , but the main army had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the quiet nave of Gettysburg . The gate in front of Mrs. Knouse 's home was still fastened by its little wooden block . No rebels had walked in her paths , or dug up her flowers . . . The mist was thickeninginto a definite rain ; the lines of shambling , stolen horses bowed their heads and quaked on , invading , invading . There were three Confederate soldiers standing at the door of the town hall as Julius Orcutt came up the steps . Two of them were privates ; they stood on either side of the door , bayonets fixed to their muskets ; both men were chewingtobacco . " Just a moment , " their officer said , and two guns lifted as one , narrow bayonets pointing at Orcutt 's middle . He said , " I am a member of the council . " His face felt very hot , and he wondered whether the rebels would understand that flush , and know what he was thinking.  |p169The  lieutenant wore an untrimmed , black mustache which drooped heavily , hiding his mouth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his back , and in each of his boot toes there was a broad crack through which the skin showed wet and pink . " What 's your name ? " he demanded . " Julius Orcutt . " The officer said a word ; butts of the guns dropped to the limestone , k-kab . Orcutt 's sleeve brushed one of the rigid bodies as he went past . He wondered whether Benjy had ever pointed his bayonet at a man 's stomach ... the long room was damp , shadowy . It smelled of cigars and rusty stoves and wet woollen clothing . A kerosene lamp flickered at the end of the table , and Doctor Kendlehart sat in its blurred circle , writing , with men standing behind him and peering over his shoulder . Manasseh Pock , the grocer , came sidling around the corner of the table ... cheese , Orcutt thought , that 's it  --  cheese : his face is sculptured from the rich yellow cheese he sells , and somehow I never realized it before . . . he offered a limp paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the enemies ' requisition , Mr. Orcutt , " came his hollow whisper . I will not whisper , the lawyer vowed to himself . I am a good Union man , my only son is before Vicksburg , my wife 's brother wore white cross-belts and was killed at Buena Vista , and we have his picture at home on the mantelshelf . " I regret that I was delayed . My wife has been indis-posed  --  " Outside , one of the rebel sentries moved his feet . Orcuttlifted the dirty foolscap sheet before his eyes , then lowered it and shook his head . " My specs are at the office . " Mr. Pock took the requisition from him . " Headquarters Early 's Division , Second Corps  --  " corpse ,  |p170he  read it  --  " C.S.A . In the field near Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , June the twenty-sixth , eighteen sixty-three --  " " Louder , please , " Orcutt snarled at him . Pock whispered closer , shaking his head sadly . So much of this , he seemed thinking between the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sixty barrels flour , seven thousandpounds pork ( but they would take bacon , they say ) , twelve hundredweight sugar , six hundredweight coffee , one thousand pounds salt , ten bushels of onions , one thousand pairs shoes , five hundred hats . " Is that all ? " asked Julius Orcutt . " Or  --  ten thousand dollars in money ! They place this levy on the whole of the borough and county . " The lawyer took the paper from his hand , and looked at it . The script was a twisting fuzz . . . so many years , he thought . I should never have tried to memorize English CommonLaw by one candle ... He let the requisition fall from his hand to the table . " The concensus of opinion , gentle-men ? " " We have been discussing the matter , and have reached a decision , " Kendlehart said . " One moment  --  until I affix my signature . " The pen-point grated sharply .

He imagined that he could feel a warm strength of muscles , flooding suddenly across his chest and into his shoulders and hips  --  why , he was thinking , even I could shoulder a gun if  --  " But I decry the abject humility of your tone , sir . "  |p171Kendlehart  motioned for silence , and went on reading . The quantities required are far beyond that in our possession .

He wantedto say something about the flag , about forefathers who haddied at Bunker Hill and Valley Forge , but all he could thinkof was Benjy : Benjy had the croup , and he was heating turpentineand lard in a pan over the wood-range , making ittingling and aromatic to drive the croup out of Benjy 's chest . He saw a tall rectangle of light all around him ; it was the door and sentries still stood there , one on each side , bayonets and buckles . He heard a low chant in the street  --  the rustling , husky whisper of many men singing , and singingdifferent songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , old man , and do n't be a fool . Gray shapes , scores of them , along the sidewalks , bunched under canopies , huddled against trees . Docile , and resting in the rain . Horses whinnied and stamped , along the street under the buckeye trees , all around the Diamond . The songs kept on , and the rain dripped , talking to itself and to this incursion . 0 Mollie , 0 Mollie it 's fo ' you Ah must roam , Ah 'm Jubal Eahly 's soldier , Dixie is myThe film of momentary rage and bafflement was washingfrom Orcutt 's eyes ; he could see more clearly at every step , even with this night fog , rainy dusk squeezing down over the village . The Dryers ' little girl stood alone on the step in front of her grandfather 's harness shop , staring at a row of ragged men who squatted on the sidewalk before her . " Sho , I et two little gals lass night , dint I , Muley ? " " You sho did . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulity . " You  --  did n't  --  either , " she kept murmuring . " Youdid n't  --  either  --  Ibet . " Orcutt went on , picking his way past the huddles of resting soldiers . A line of freight wagons , farm carts , Conestogas , ambulances , was plowing directly across the Diamond , east toward the York Pike . Then perhaps they would not be staying here , perhaps they would go within the hour . He heard a familiar voice , but distorted by sheer rage , rising close at hand : " Mind , mind ! Leggo o ' me , you damn Secesh  --  " A big circle of men had formed by Pock 's store . A tall man , Orcutt could look over the packed shoulders and twisting heads and see old John Burns being dragged across the sidewalk by young soldiers who held his arms pinioned against his sides . The constable was holding back with all his might , rigid as a poker , his stubborn feet scraping as the cap/tors hauled him forward . There was all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode rapidly against the edge of the crowd , on the opposite side ; a big horse surged into the group , head drawn high . " Look out , " shrilled a voice , " it 's of Jube ... " Elbows , knees , gouging metal  --  men stepped upon Orcutt 's feet , stumbling , giving way as the rider pushed into the circle . He was saturnine , round-shouldered ; his beard was a mass of stained strings . " What the God damn hell 's the matter ? " he screamed . " Gen'ral Eahly , seh ... this fellow was abusin ' us  --  " " Hell , " squealed Early . " He 's old enough to be yo ' grand-daddy , boys . " Burns lifted his hot eyes . " I ai n't so old , you damn rebel . I 'm constable of this borough , and I 'll enforce the law , and I do n't need no Secesh thieves to put me about my business .

Other officers rode forward to join him . " Lieutenant Dilse has jest repo'ted . . . town council , seh . " Early 's wiry voice skewered up again : " To the devil with the Yankee council ! " and then Orcutt could hear him saying something about York . Two soldiers emerged from the crowd , with John Burns clutched between them ; they trotted him off across the Diamond . I wonder if they will shoot him at sunrise , Orcutt thought . No , no , that is outlandish . He went up the dusky stairway into his office , lit a lamp , and stood for a long time looking at a steel engraving of John Marshall , as if he had never seen John Marshall before ... Bugles began to blat , all through the heart of the town , and out into the rainy country beyond ; you heard their tight , brassy squawl relayed beyond the reach of any ears . Orcutt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his eyes , and tried to sleep . Sleep ! when every nerve was pricking and alive , when the cells of his body crept out like mice , fleeing around the office . . . then he could feel them stealing back into his fingertips again . A brief oration resounded outside : the commanding voice of one trumpeting his verbiage to the patient troops who were his bench and his jury . Soldiers ! Your march through the enemy 's country has been marked by Victory and Plenty  --  Orcutt thought , " Another lawyer . A rebel one . ' . He could hear the jingle of scabbards , the droning orders , the incrediblesigh of two thousand men picking themselves up and moving obediently once more . But he was afraid to look out of the window , for fear they would not be marching away after all . By the time darkness was thick and certain , they were gone . The rain held an intense glow of burning freight cars , east of town , and distantly men could recognize the sound of axes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orcutt went home , holding himself with stiff dignity , the roof of his mouth dry as flannel . " At least , " he thought , " I can tell Benjy that I did not treat with them . I have no reason to be ashamed . " His wife was sitting in a merino wrapper , waiting for him . She was drinking an herb tea which was said to be good for the heart , and she cried to Orcutt that she had had another chill as soon as neighbors told her that the rebels were gone . Mrs. Huddlestone had a lamp in her front room , and she came to the window and peeked out when she heard Dan Bale walk up on the porch . Seen through the cheap , rippled glass of a nine-paned window , her face did not seem desiccatedby worry but merely drooping in sad folds as if thep175bony reinforcement behind it were somehow evaporated . She recognized him ; he could hear her murmur , " Way a minnuh , Annyull . " She went over to the table where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fixed them in her mouth before she opened the door . " I 've news of Elijah . Good news , " he added quickly . Her mouth opened and shut ; the teeth clicked ; her dab of a nose began to show pink in the middle of her china face . " Lijy is n't  --  hurt ? " " No . I 've seen him . " He came into the room , but she still stood beside the door , holding it open ; she might have been expecting Elijah to follow him in , musket and all . Wine-colored cloth with tiny fleurs-de-lis in its pattern , lay spread across the sewing table , tenting down two sides and spilling over the carpet like a twilled path for some noble to walk upon . The dress-form was a senseless statue beside Mrs. Huddlestone 's chair : its meshed body had been expandedto the fullest  --  bust , waist and hips  --  and rich armor of the purplish bombazine had been pinned over its breast . Elijah 's mother had a silver thimble on her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she gazed at Dan . " He got away safely , Mrs. Huddlestone . He and a boy named Fisher  --  a student . I saw them go . " " He did n't get caught by  --  " " No . No . " He kept repeating it , sing-song doggerel . " No . Not hurt at all . When the regiment retreated , he and this Fisher were separated from the rest . They got as far as my place . Mrs. Fanning let them take a horse and rig . They drove south before the rebels reached town . " Water was dulling her eyes behind their spectacles ; her eyelids blurred rapidly . She made a little crowing sound as she nodded toward the image beside the table . " That 's for her . "  | " That  --  " " It 's going to be Mrs. Fanning 's new gown . She wanted me to give her a fit some time before Sunday . I was sewing on it just now . Ever since The Enemies come to town . Yes , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was  --  kind of worried . It was real thoughtful of you to come and tell me , Daniel . " The water began to slide over her round cheeks . . . not tears , he thought . Just thin water , a nervous quantity of it which has been in her eyes all this time , and only overflows because it 's no longer needed there . He did not tell her of how Elijah was lying on the floor of the buttery , how he leaned against the door casing , how Fisher carried their muskets across the pasture . The buggy : they rolled it out . They , he said , harnessed the colt . They drove away . Yes , Elijah felt fine . . . The words were crowding in Dan 's mouth ; it seemed difficult to sort them and select the right ones to give to Mrs. Huddlestone , while she stood there spanking her thimble and blinking at him . " First I heard about it , " she said , " was when the Leen boys come running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat and put her in the woodshed , because The Enemies was coming . " She sat down suddenly in her low , padded rocker . The little yarn balls on its arms danced and trembled . " I just kept sewing  --  kept cutting out the goods . Seemed as if I had to ... I 'm real glad about Lijy . Mrs. Endsor come and rapped on the window awhile ago , and she said the rebels was gone . " He nodded . " I inquired around to make sure . It waspossible that the Confederates might have overtaken Elijah , somewhere down the Baltimore Pike . But they did n't go thatway . Likely Hud will turn up in a day or two , unless he andFisher decide to go south and join with the regular army . " The woman let her rocker creak for several minutes . " Then I 'll keep right on with the bombazine , so 's I can givep177her a fit . The Enemies did n't capture any Gettysburg folks , did they , Daniel ? " " Only John Burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as soon as the troops left . They 're all over up north , folks say , on the Hunterstown road . " Again she said , " My . " And then , babbling rapidly , " War is such an awful thing . An awful , awful thing , Daniel . I wish Lijy did n't think he had to go to it ... Let me give you a snack . I feel as if I could eat hearty and give thanks to The Lord , with Lijy safe , and all . " He tried to excuse himself but she made him take two hermit cookies , from a big blue plate which she brought out of the kitchen . Crumbs surfeited his mouth as he went away through the murk . . . he and Elijah sat in their secret den behind the rhubarb bed , eating warm hermits , and Elijahrunning up to the door again and again to ask for more . A dozen years . He could not imagine such armies then , such a cancer of impending battles ... He threw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartless and wastefulto do so ; he walked toward the Diamond . The rain was a steady rustle all around , and the baggy macintosh which had belonged to Pentland Bale , swished and crackled as Dan moved in it . With the morning , he thought , little boys would come splashing down York street . They 'd appear not as they did ordinarily , after a rain  --  to squash the puddles of mud about , to work up mud puddings at every little bog  --  but to search for the dismantled droppings of the soldiers . Things would lie scattered among the ruts which marred the tenderest portionsof the Pike : wads of chewed tobacco , torn straps , ears of corn , a ragged pair of drawers , and a scrap of money printed in Richmond . And always and always would be the apples of manure , high-piled , low-piled , sown freely  --  soft , hard , tan , greenish , yellow  --  long windrows of hasty excre- tion , the last record of an army which hurried as its beasts emptied themselves . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though only a few lights shone in the stores . There was a gobble of voices mingled with the hollow dripping of wooden eaves . . . " and put all the women-folks and children in the Presbyterian church or somewheres , and get what guns we can together " . . . " saw more soldiers already on the road from Mummasburg , and cannons by them " ... they jabbered boldly , now that the gray men were gone to York . Dan passed the porch railing , a yard from the nearest group . Someone grunted , " Who is that ? " and the chatter dulled down for a moment . A low voice muttered , " Any Copperhead could let ' em come in his yard and get a drink . " Bale turned , and came up the steps . Sides of faces , whiskered profiles showing brown in the glow of hotel lamps . " Who said that ? " he asked . Nobody answered , but they were all looking at him . A one-legged shape clicked across from the doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Bale , " Bart McKosh said . " Fannings ' nigger just told me how you got Huddlestoneand Tom Fisher away . If I had two good legs I 'd kick the poop out of anybody says you 're a Copperhead . " " I 'd rather do it myself , " Dan replied . " Thank you , anyway . " He went down the steps and on around the edge of the Diamond . A few doors west of the square , and on the south side of Chambersburg street , was a black vacancy between two buildings . Dan remembered it as a torment of his childhood , when first he was old enough to come home alone at night . Daytimes the cavity was innocent enough : a narrow waste where grass grew tall , where rubble coasted slowly into a weedy excavation which once had been a cellar . At night , and to a frightened boy , the ten-yard gap was charged with evil ; no goblins but gibbered there , spitting their decayedbreath in your face no matter how fast you ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They twitched forward through the rain , and one of them was an old man who carried a lantern in his hand . The goblin was saying , repeatedly : " Come out . Go ahead . Walk careful , or I 'll shoot . " Feet came sliding closer . The voice cried , " And do n't try to scrootch down in that hole . . . " There were three figures , fumbling and sodden , scourged by the rusty shaft of lantern light . Once more the old man lifted his voice : he was John Burns . " Who 's that there ? Stop , so 's I can look at these fellows . " Bale waited . Three hunched shapes stepped up on the wet bricks . The lantern swung close to Dan 's face . " Oh , " Burns said , and Bale could not analyze his tone or sense what disapproval was there . " Hold this light for me , Mister Bale . I got two prisoners . " One of them said , " Wawl never teched nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' from the rain . " " I was pretty sure I heard somebody in that old smokehousebehind Peiffers ' . " This was an honest duty which Burns was doing ; he did not gloat , but there was a metal of reclaimed pride about him . " Hold still , you . " He jerked at the slide of the lantern . Bilious skin , boys who had been very weary for days at a time ; they looked as if their thin faces had been twisted from cheek to chin by some vicious sculptor . Both were hatless ; one wore a homespun shirt with no collar , and the other had a Zouave 's jacket from which the buttons were gone . " Stragglers , I 'll be bound , " John Burns announced . He held a revolver in his left hand . " They 're not over fifteen , " Bale said to him . The old man growled , " I was n't much more'n that when I fit the British . Come along , the two of you . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bale and herded his prisoners away toward the Diamond . Someone yelled from the hotel porch , " What 's goin ' on over there ? " The consta/o ble grunted , " Got two stragglers , " but they could not have heard him over at the hotel . Then he seemed to ask the two Confederate boys a question ; Dan caught the word , " Hungry , " and there was a quick mutter of soft voices . Lanternbeams bobbing , they splashed away through the mud .. . He will feed them at once , Bale thought . He will go to great inconvenience to find food for them ; he will tramp back and forth in the rain , carrying things ; all the time , he will threaten them with his revolver . The roof of the jail will lie between them and the rain . Let them thank whatever fortunethey know , for this imprisonment . And long before he reached his dark house , he was aware that his fear of the vacant lot between two buildings , the memory he held of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herded in their stealth  --  all were forever muted and brushed over by this later hour . He would see Burns ' rusty lantern swaying in dreams for years to come , no matter what else came to happen . As he crossed the bridge over Stevens Run , he heard a splashing at the brookside , then once more only the slow tinkle of water from soaked timbers : he knew that another dun shadow had stumbled into the darkness at his approach ... someone crawled over the gate into the pasture east of Mrs. Knouse 's property before he went past . Like an old comb , the piece of an army had drawn itself down this highway , and its broken teeth lay scattered behind . Dan 's front door was standing open . He remembered that he had locked no doors when he went away ; out west , there was not a cabin on his prairies which could be locked when the owner was absent , and the acquisitive , defending fear of this town had not yet marked him . Stragglers : they might take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bale 's gold studs ; his watches and books and the hidden , filigree jewelry which Dan 's mother had once worn .. . THE CHAMBERSBURG PIKE 181p181He pushed aside the light frame of the mosquito-bar and stood peering into the black hall . " Dan , " Irene Fanning whispered . She had been waiting for him , alone in that house with all its haunts . Mrs. Fanning . It struggled toward his lips : he thought of saying that before it seemed natural and right to call her name . " I 'm sitting on the stairs . Here . I 've been waiting . " His hands hunted for her . " One minute . I 'll make a light . " " No . " And then he realized that her voice was swollen with some peculiar emotion ; it was scarcely the voice he was learning to know so well . " Close the shutters first . " He went into the library , feeling for the dusty shutters which had not been closed for a long time . One after anotherhe drew the slatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two on the side facing the Knouse place . The corner of the big desk drove itself against his hip . " There 's a candle here , somewhere , " he called , and he could hear her rustling into the room , feeling her way , arms fending out before her . The match crackled , its dripping sparks scorched the carpet . There was the oily flicker of dead candle-wickyielding itself to flame . The woman said , " It was raining the first time I was here , too . Was n't it ? " Across shining chair-backs , she stared at him . She had a dark cloak caught around her shoulders , the goods still speckled with raindrops , and the puckered hood hanging loosely down her back . Beneath the cloak he could see the same black silk which she had worn when first he met her . " Raining , " Dan echoed . " Yes . Not like this  --  it was a storm . " He demanded , shrilly , " Is anything wrong ? " " I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . Oh  --  that . The notion was full-born ,  | robust in his mind even as he glimpsed it . She would be compelled to divorce Tyler Fanning , at once . There could be no tenderness in the consideration of such vital need . She 'd have to . . . that . He went toward her , reaching out his hand ; the unnecessary chairs got in his way . " You mean that you 're going to  --  that you 've found out  --  " " No , " she said , sharply . " Not that . Not yet . " He stopped . He looked at her eyes , bitter and intent . Her hands , clenching the Windsor chair in front of her . " Not that , " she said again . " I 'm sorry if you thought  --  No . For that matter  --  " her eyes went down , and her mouth twitched precisely over the indelicacy  --  " perhaps I can never have any  --  children . " There was something white in the hand she lifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter from Tyler . " " I remember . Mr. Fanning gave it to you , out there . " He took the paper from her and began to smooth it , pressingout the wrinkles . She told him , " I had to bring it to you . It was the only thing to do . Tyler 's father and mother ate in their room  --  what they did eat  --  and I had my supper alone . I 've found a key for my room ; it is locked ; they 'll think I am asleep . Just as before . " He could hear the deep sighing of her breath . " I go out like a jailbird or a  --  woman criminal . A sneak .. . I heard Mr. Fanning reading their letter aloud . It  --  was not like my letter . " Dan was still rubbing the sheet , still looking at her . " Oh , read it ! " she cried . Tyler 's narrow , tilted hand-writing covered one side of the double sheet and half of the second page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-first of June . " Dear Wife , " Tyler said , " I am sending this in care of ChaplainKraal , who is going to Baltimore and will post it for me . No doubt you will be surprised to hear from me in this vein , but there is a certain matter concerning which I feelp183impelled to address you . Word has been sent me by a certain party , making a strong accusation of infidelity against you . My first impulse was of anger toward the informant , but on closer study of the matter regret to say I would not be surprised if it  --  " the lines were more tilted than ever , wider apart , and he had omitted an essential verb  --  " true . That might explain ( if true , and not idle gossip ) the increasing coldness evident in your manner to me . I refer to Dan Bale . I am here  --  " the word was blotted beyond recognition  --  " my duty , and expect to continue so unless killed , which might relieve the situation for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said : " To my certain knowledge , the informant has never told an untruth , at least not in the years I have known Said Informant , which is a long time . Write to me at once if you can clear yourself . Bale has shown himself utterly reprehensible , and I will attend to him in due time if I survive . Of course I am writing nothing of this to my parents . Your reply awaited with the utmost eagerness . Deeply wronged , but still Your Husband . Capt . Tyler Fanning . 72 P. V. " Dan realized that he was saying , rapidly , driving himself to say it .. . his throat grown raw : " Look here . I cannotunderstand this . The letter is dated June twenty-first , and he left here on Sunday the fourteenth . We  --  it was that night , and  --  This letter of which he speaks  --  why , " he cried , " it must have reached his camp as soon as he did ! " " They 've moved . A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thoroughfare Gap is a long way from there . I searched it out on the map . " Her mouth blurred , the lips bleached and quavering . " I felt I should bring the letter to you . " He said , " That 's right and just . " He wanted to say more , to tell her how totally unjust the whole situation was ... rage began to sparkle across his brain . " Now , listen , "  | he was saying , roughly , " this has come as we might have supposed it would come . You must divorce him . There 's no use in haggling merely because Tyler is in the army . You have suffered enough at his hands before this . Is there any reason for you to be defamed by some  --  " Her face was more brittle and white than he had ever seen it . " You know that it is all very true . " " This is no common infidelity ! How could you be unfaithful to a faith which never existed ? " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I did n't recognize its existence for him . " The candle trickled its pennant from side to side ; their thin shadows grew and blurred , dissolved , grew once more on the faded wall paper . . . The girl still stood behind the tall chair , facing him . He had the grotesque thought that she was a prisoner in a dock made of Windsor spindles . " Do you love him ? I ask that for the first time . When you werehysterical  --  youtold me that you did n't love him . Now you must tell me again . " She shook her head . " I do n't feel toward Tyler as I do toward you . " The blue shadows hunted up from the hollow of her bosom , washed across her set , stubborn face . " I do n't  --  wish him , as I have wished you . I do n't  --  " She whispered , " Please do n't make me go on . " He felt an impulse to snarl , Go on ! But the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he was responsible for this . He , and whoever had been the informant . Dan took a deep breath . " The window , " he said aloud . The woman 's glance raced to the tall shutters which caged around two sides of the room . " Oh . " Her shoulders sagged again . " You mean  --  that night in the kitchen . Then you did see someone . " " It was a face . I did n't know whose . Just a blur , and then gone away . I thought it was only a tramp  --  they go pastp185here , sometimes . Army deserters and ... it was n't a tramp . " " Do you know who it was ? " " It 's all come back ; I puzzled , and I could n't understand why he  --  There is a man in town named Quagger . Perhaps you do n't know who he is . " She said , wretchedly , " He worked for Mr. Fanning . Years ! I know  --  I 've heard them speak of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a church man , but a sympathizer with the south , and so he discharged him . I thought  --  oh , it was absurd  --  I thought it might be Mrs. Knouse . " " No . That fellow Quagger . . . He was staring at me . " " Why would he be at the window ? " " Like most of the dolts in this village , he could not understand how I refused to enter the army unless I felt as he did . He approached me , to discuss the matter . I was angry . I  --  laid hands on him . Perhaps he came to try to do some harm . " Bale paused for a moment , thinking rapidly . " No , I think I 've got it . Elijah was here to tell me about the militia and the new citizens ' army . He must have followedElijah here ; later he saw you and me come into the kitchen  --  " The girl 's hand strayed across her forehead , rubbing back the damp surf of her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . I 'm glad I did pity them . Now I can be more charitable with myself . " " He had the courage of his convictions , at least . Quaggerhad . He signed his name to the letter . " Dan 's shadow blocked hugely ahead of him as he came toward her . He lifted her limp hands from the chair-back , and put his arm around her . Irene 's body seemed to surrender inside its damp wrappings , but her face turned away . " Oh , do n't , " she cried . " I 'm too stained , too maligned and  --  The Fannings ! I have to go on  --  living there , feeling this  --  " He swore in a raw whisper ... his arms tighter and tighter , drawing her loins against his : " You have to do nothing of the sort . We 'll go .

" She cried , " You can go , Dan . You  --  Go away and leave me . Much the best that you can  --  " " You wish me to go ? Actually ? " " Yes , yes ! Dan  --  " He said , " God . Oh , God . I would n't go if  --  " His face came down ; he pressed her hands aside ; she struggled weakly , and the damp cloak slid down in a soggy pile . In this gown I saw you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from you now . We are going through something : it is a  --  phase .. . Damp , abusive , their lips came together . Just as before , he cried to her without words , just as the other nights . In these few weeks we have met and tasted and taken ; you must take , I must give to you , you must take and absorb . " Dan . . . " she groaned , an aching murmur , curlingout from the hot crowding of their mouths . " I have to go back , to that house  --  to them  --  " No , he said , if you must go back , you can go later , but we shall forget the disaster . Tomorrow we may talk about it ; the invaders are gone , the roads are safe , you can drive out with an old horse , I will meet you ; in a few days you can decide coldly and justly , what you shall say to him . Or I will say it . I will go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now , not now . Again this is our night.  |p187With  the girl sobbing , shivering in his arms , he went over and blew out the candle . The darkness wrapped so tightly around them that they became utterly insensitive to it ; it was difficult to think about the next day , or even what home-going might be necessary before morning . He began to tell her , rapidly and many times , that he loved her . It was the most sincere belief he had ever held in all his life , and came tonight with acid intensity . Body , thoughts , taste of your mouth , the feel of breasts and thighs , the astral voicelessnesswhich is your spirit , all of these I worship and want to possess as I possess my own . He told her again and again by word , by touch , by the whole use of his body . The woman left off sobbing ; her flesh grew warm . . . give , give to me forever , she told him  --  darling , give to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes it or not . At this moment all wickedness is pure . In the blistering sunshine of Tuesday , Henry Niede brought his horses and cattle back from the valley where he had hidden them . Together with neighbors living along the Emmetsburg road , he had herded his stock some two miles down Plum Run on Friday , when the growl of the Confederate advance was heard from the northwest . Although no foraging parties penetrated south of Gettysburg that day , the farmers felt shrewd and not a little thankful that they had led their property out of harm 's way . Those were pitiablepeople out along the Chambersburg Pike  --  and on the York Pike , east  --  who had not sense enough to find a secret , grassy den for their teams and milch cows . The rebels were not smart men , Henry had heard . They would butcher a young , fresh cow without a second 's thought , or else chase her along with their roaring , stolen herds to be beef on the second or third day after . If he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sense about the cattle he butchered . And valuable heifers with good points  --  especially Alderneys  --  he would not butcher , but save them and bring them home when he came from the war . He could not blame the Confederates for their thievishness , but he felt a cold horror at their waste . There were complications in hiding the stock . A boy or a man had to remain on guard all the time and keep the animals away from an unfenced wheat field nearby , or from being lost . It was a long way to go to milk nights and mornings , and seemed even farther when you had to drive with the eighteen-year-old blind mare which you had kept on the place . The woman said it was bad for milk to be joggled in a wagon and carried across fences and hills in pails . The cows did not give as they should have given ... His sorrel colt was a wild one , always galloping and squealing about , and he would be lucky if the colt did n't fall into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And maybe somebody else  --  not rebels  --  would steal the kelver and carry them off in a covered cart . It was bad , having all your stock in the woods . You would wake up at night and hear them mooing down there , and wonder if maybe a bear might not come out of the mountains over west , and prowl down to Plum Run and do some damage . Nevertheless , Niede co . id not bring himself to drive the animals home when tl , rest of the neighbors did , on Monday . They appeared so c : . nfident that all danger was past . The rebels had gone clear to Harrisburg , men declared , and likely would capture Philadelphia too , and go back south by way of Washington . Some man came in from Taneytownon Sunday night , with a Baltimore newspaper . The Baltimore paper was certain that the enemy were cutting railroads for the sole purpose of leaving Baltimore and the capital defenseless when attacked from the north . Nein , men said , they will not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when they go back to the south they will go by other roads . It is safe to bring the horses and cattle out of the woods . Henry told them that he would wait . He gratified himself by imagining how silly his neighbors would look if the raiders returned on Monday night and found every stall and cow-shed crammed with occupants , ready for the taking . He was too smart for that , and anyway people said that gray riders had been seen on the Newville road again and again , and there were still people fleeing north from Frederick , and crying that more rebels came .. . The sun had a confident , beaming promise on Tuesday morning . Looking at it as it crept above the pale yellow of the wheat , Niede was forced to admit that the war must be far away by now . His wheat was ready to cut , or would be in another day , and he would need his horses . You could n't go about harvest when you were spending half your time running back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see about getting a man . He did have a cheap one  --  a boy , seventeenyears old  --  who had been bound out by his grandfather . But the ungrateful lout ran away to the war , and had n't been heard from for six months . Men wanted a lot of wages ... yes , some of them even figured it in gold , and they ate as if food could be had for the asking . Times were bad , but he could n't get in his harvest alone . Amelia and the woman were no good in the field : Amelia acted sullen because her arms turned red , and her mother stood up for her ... Uncle Otto could n't even milk . He was a no-good . But he would leave the woman some property when he died . It looked like , he was going to live forever . Niede got up at daylight and drove down to the Devil 's Den and walked for ten minutes in the dark , wet woods before he heard the bell-cow . There had been company at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was all alone . No guard was at hand any more , so if the cattlep190had ruined anyone 's field Henry might have to pay for it . His forehead dampened with chilly sweat as that thought came to him . . . He experienced great difficulty in finding the horses ; when found , he cursed them and tied them firmly , each to a separate tree . After consideration , he risked bringingthe colt home with him , fastened behind the milk-cart and like to upset it a dozen times . It was late , and he had little more than half the milk he should have had . Those calves had been at the One-Horn and the White-face again , the little esel ! He should have bound branches around their necks , with sharp points to gouge the mothers and make them kick the calves away , but then the branches were liable to pin them in the bushes so that they might break their foolish necks . It was bad , having your cows away off in the forest . He kept telling himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail ... what I would like to do to them . After breakfast the sun was smooth and honest above Granite Ridge , and the air was warming rapidly . It would be a hot day , and the little kernels of wheat would dry and grow fat and warm in their splintery husks . The wheat should be cut by tomorrow ; tomorrow was July first ; you could n't wait all summer , rebels or no rebels . He told his wife , as he pushed away the coffee-pot : " I got those horses tied , down there . I should go and bring them home now , and the cattle too . " " Better you had brought them yesterday like other folks , " she told him . She did not look forward to wheatharvest . She was a dull , funny woman . He could n't make her out , sometimes . " And if those damn armies had got them , you would think I was a smart man , ja ? " " The armies never got Codoris ' stock . They never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor  --  " " Ach , " he said , coldly , " you are a fool woman ! "  |p191She  made no response , but went on washing dishes , the strong soft soap foaming between her red fingers . " Where is Amelia ? " Henry demanded . " By the chickens . " He said , " It 's a wonder she is doing any good around here . It 's a great wonder she ai n't set down to weep over that no-good of hers . " Mrs. Niede turned , slowly , to face him . She had the hard , somber boniness of feature which she had transmitted to her daughter , and twenty years before she had been almost as pretty . " I do n't want you should talk that way , " she muttered . " He is now a soldier . Remember you that . He is gone to fight those same rebels you hid your cows from . Maybe you should be glad that there were men like him to make the rebels go away , and not steal things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry laughed . " I guess I know what they told me in town . He ran away , and they say Mr. Fanning is like to lose a buggy and colt because he took ! Oh , he is a fine soldier . " He clumped out to the back porch . Uncle Otto was coming up out of the root cellar . . . buttermilk , always buttermilk he was drinking . Quarts and quarts , which was just as good for the pigs . It would make the pigs fat , but Uncle Otto was already fat and that did n't net a dime for anybody . Amelia was down at the chicken coops ; she looked bleached and shrunken in her loose calico gown and blue sunbonnet , like a child dressed up in her mother 's clothes . Ach , that girl , he thought . She has got the looks ; she ought to find a rich husband . But now she will be an old maid . I would like to beat some brains into her , if I could . He ordered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To get the cattle . " " Henry , " cried his wife , behind him , " you should get you a man . Two men . "  | " And costs maybe half a dollar ? " he snarled . Amelia said , " I 'm coming . " She left her basket in the corn-crib , and walked toward the porch . . . He had never struck her since she was grown , but always she acted as if she expected a blow from him . Her mother spoiled her . She took money out of the teapot , and gave it to her to buy ribbonsand truck , and like enough when Henry came in from the field of an evening , he would find that Amelia 's mother had let her go off to town with the Duffeys or somebody . He grinned without humor . " So . You wear the good shoes to feed chickens . " " These are old ones , Pa . " " Your Aunt Gerta , she would never waste shoes while she was doing work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got feet so bad now , " Amelia said sharply , " she can hardly walk on them at all . " Her face began to show the mottled pinkness it always showed when she was frightened and angry at the same time . Henry told her , " Just the same , girl , Aunt Gerta got her a good husband . Was not an old maid when she was twenty  --  " " Mealy , " came his wife 's shrill voice , " your Pa is going to bring back the stock . You come and get you a sunbonnet , because he wants you should help him drive them up . " Niede said , " Come on , " and started toward the barn for halters . Then he remembered that he had placed their halters on the horses already  --  they were tied , down there in woods , kicking at flies and waiting for him . He heard Amelia say , " I 've got a bonnet , " but she went into the house anyway , wasting time . Uncle Otto settled himself heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking in der Alt , saying something about a fine week for harvest , but Henry did n't turn his head . When his wife wanted to bring Uncle Otto there , twelve years before , he had agreed because he thought the old man would Eve only a year or two . And he had lived all this time , eat-Ip193ing his share  --  to say nothing of buttermilk and peaches and tobacco  --  and even if his wife got the larger share of Uncle Otto 's property , Henry would not be much ahead . Finally Amelia came out , and they started across the hayfield toward the ridge . It was a short cut this way , if you had to walk : shorter than going southwest by the Emmetsburgroad . Henry carried a rusty , perforated pail in which he had put some lumps of salt wrapped in a newspaper . The pail was no good any more ; he could throw it away , down there in the woods , and would n't have to lug it home after he had lured the cattle with salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow along , or he could lead them if he did n't have to herd the cows too much . He would give the girl a long switch and she could come on foot , keeping the cattle moving . He began to wish , now , that he had brought his stock home the day before ; then the neighbors had helped each other ; he wondered why people did n't ever seem anxious to trade work with him ... he had had to work very hard . And now Amelia was a lazy-bones . He would never have a son . The woman suffered trouble with her insides , after Amelia was born ; she lay in bed six weeks , though Henry was certain that she might have got up sooner . He looked back at his daughter , climbing over the stone fence from Codoris ' pasture . Ach , and with all her looks she had not got a rich man . There was old man Truckenmiller ; he would not live long , and he owned three farms that peopleknew of , and maybe more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which barely reached his ears . Somehow , it made him intensely angry to have her lagging behind that way , and singing silly songs . . . some mischief brewing  --  so that 's what you 're after , a whole cherry pieHe yelled over his shoulder : " Better you hurry , and not sing light songs and nonsense . The kelver maybe is lost in the woods . " She stopped singing , and trudged behind without saying anything , though once she sobbed when she twisted her ankle . Shoes  --  wearing shoes at work ! A young girl had good strong feet ; shoes were for church and weddings . As soon as they reached the woods , they began to have trouble . The calves had indeed hidden themselves , in a little patch of bushes high among the rocks ; how they ever got there was a mystery ; they peeked out like big-eyed deer . It took half an hour to climb around and catch them and drag them , bawling , back to the herd . And the sun was high , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle than she stumbled over some stones and nearly threw him . He gave her a good stick where it would do the most good . . . ach , she acted like a wild horse , and they would never get home this way ! It was certainly ten o'clock before they got the stragglingbeasts up to the Emmetsburg road . Ten men would have had a time ; Henry knew that the delay was not Amelia 's fault , though he blamed her loudly for it . She had torn her dress in two places , her face was a dull red , she had a scratch on her cheek , and there were dirty tear-marks around her eyes . The cattle were wild ones and the horses almost as bad , except old Heine , and he moved as if each hoof were buried in mud above the shaggy hock . Half the day speeding by , and the cattle not home yet . " You bet God is giving it to me , " Henry told Amelia coldly . " God is mad because I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work like she should . " He howled at the animals : " You damn verrickt , and get to the road ! Throw them a stone once , you no-good  --  " At every lane opening , at Sherfys ' dooryard , at Codoris ' , the herd made a lumbering dash for shade and freedom . You had only to leave your stock in the woods for four days to make them as savage as Indians . The sunshine pushed down ; they stewed in its pale glare , and Henry began to forget about harvest . He could feel yellow dust settling in his throat , coat/ing his eyeballs , dry and scorching all over his body sweat .. . Well , at last they were getting the dumb-heads home . He would like to let them go without their feed this night , and see how they liked it . Only you could not ( 10 that to cows ; they had to eat , or you got no milk . Precious little milk he would get until they were tamed again . . . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amelia had been wailing , again and again . " Pa ! " He was hot and tired  --  he had been astir and slaving for many hours , and he hated Amelia and the stock . It will serve her right , he thought , if she hollers and hollers until she has lost her voice and can only croak like a frog . Only when he heard the rapid stutter of many hoofs behind him , was he prompted to turn his head , and then his red rage began to shrivel . Five men were looming close at hand , and they looked like a whole army . After all , after his scheming and caution and hard work , he was going to lose his herd . These men would take them  --  five men , and they had guns . Their horses were coated with dust ; the long , curved scabbards rattled and clanked . . . Henry pushed old Belle toward the fence ... ja , ja , he was afraid . They drew up in a fierce circle around him and Amelia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's delay . " Hey , " a dry voice said , " any Butternuts around here , farmer ? " Henry took a deep breath . These men were blue  --  a bleached and unwholesome blue , but it was not the color of the enemy . High boots on their legs and " Cat 's got his tongue , " a soldier grunted . They turned toward the girl . An older man asked , not unkindly : " How about it , sissy ? Seen any rebels ? " Amelia whispered , " No , sir . " The cows were all bunchingalong the fence-side , ahead , and beginning to eat . Niede cried , with huge relief , " I thought was rebels sure , mnister ! No , they 're gone . "  | " When ? " " A-Friday . " He wondered why he should be so humble and fawning before these rigid figures , when three of them were young enough to be his sons . " No more left in the neighborhood , eh ? " Henry said , expansively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess some is left on the roads up north . Folks say they seen ' em . But I guess most is gone to Harris-burg . " The oldest soldier had a scrubby beard ; his eyes looked like black nail-heads driven deep in saddle leather . There were wide yellow V 's , whole slabs of them , on his arms . " Same story , Andy . Reckon we better report . " He spurted a long string of brown spittle into the road : it rolled like a ball . The horses turned , with much creaking and jingling . The older man swung back , and jerked his square head at Henry . " That town Gettysburg , ahead ? " Niede nodded . He kept wondering whether these men might not be fancying his cattle , after all . He had heard that even the Northern soldiers were apt to steal from farmers unless they were watched closely . . . " They 're all Dutch , around here , " he heard the man with the yellow V 's say to the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Buford . " The dust foamed in choking clouds ; long after they had vanished in it , you could hear the rumpety-rump of hoofs flogging back . No rebels . . . Henry Niede felt like a very young man once more , free from the elderly worries and sins which had been crushing him down . " See , " he crowed at his daughter , " there is real soldiers , and not like your Huddlestone who runs away in a buggy and do n't come back yet ! " He kicked at Belle 's ribs , and headed toward the One-horn who was strayingthrough a fence-gap into clover . " Donnerwedder holt ! " he roared , " Odder Ich farschlock dir der Kup ! " He was pleased enough to reach home safely with his stock , and he did not stop to berate Amelia any more . Hep197drank some coffee , ate a few crullers , and walked in to the village to bargain for harvest help . God began to be good to him at last ; in Middle street he met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natured souls , and they would work for small pay . Henry hurried back home with the pleasant idea growing in his mind that Uncle Otto might have died suddenly during this excessive heat  --  dead and no bother to anyone , out there beside the well . But a dust cloud , vast and ominous , was pressing north past the Sherfy farm , and Uncle Otto was quite alive , standing out in the road with Amelia and the woman . " Look ! " they all cried at Henry as he approached , " and comes thousands of soldiers with horses . . . They 're ours , " Amelia kept saying bravely to her mother . " Ma , they are blue . They 're our side . " Likely enough , she was imagining that Elijah might be with them . It was shortly before this that Doctor Duffey stopped at the Bale house , hoping to snatch a few moments ' rest in what had been a disheartening day . He was losing a tumor case which he had thought to save , and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whom he felt that he could not do enough . In such hours the Irish morbidity of his ancestors acted as his curse , even though their mysticism might be a belated blessing . He found Daniel Bale in his undershirt , covered with sweat , and swinging a scythe through the rank weed patch beside the old stable . The sun was white-hot overhead , and through all its course the temperature had swelled . Only in shadier tangles near the gum tree was there any buzzing of grass insects ; yellow dust lay thick and cooked along the Pike , and old Salt waited at the gate with his head hanging low , suffering agonies of flies with scarcely a quiver . Duffey sat down on the well-curb , groaning softly . " Come over and pump me a drink , " he begged . " It 'll be easier than cutting weeds . This is scarce a day for needless ambition . " Dan hung the scythe on a peg under the stable eaves and came across the lawn , rubbing a soaked forearm over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I 'd take down all the grass in the back lot . There 'll be goldenrodlater if I do n't , and Mrs. Knouse suffers from hay fever . " " Sure , " the doctor nodded , " and not a bit of it the fault of your weed patch . " His bright eyes rolled up for a scant second , then vanished again under crusty lids . " I 've observed that a man can find excuse enough for driving his body to tormentwhen his soul 's in the same place . " Dan stopped , with his fingers clutching the pump handle . He asked , " What are you hinting , Doc ? " " You 've been bothered to death . Anybody could see that . " " I 'll thank them not to see it . " " Go on , and draw me a bit of a drink . " Bale 's lips squeezed together . The pump groaned and gurgled . Water came up through its suction with tardy reluctance , rising nearly to the spout , grunting spasmodically down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duffey put his cupped hands out and dashed the water over his face . " That 's good , " he gasped . " I ca n't be saying as much for the rest of the day . This is the first good I 've found in it . " Dan kept the pump handle moving ; he bent down and sucked a mouthful of water from the spout , then spurted it out into the grass . " Katie Huffmaster , " the old man said , as if in continuation , " she was run away with , you 'll remember . " Bale sat upon the well-curb . " Yes . The horse was frightened by the locomotive . " " A young horse , a bad one , and they should never have let her take him out alone . Poor child . " He droned it softly , over and over . " Poor child , and she 's got a right femur shat/tered . I 'm fearing she will be a cripple for life , even if I save her the leg . I started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatus , without extension . Now I 've got her in a fracture box filled with bran , poor child . . . It 's hot this day , Dan . Too hot . I sometimes wish  --  " Abruptly , he ceased speaking and began to pat his damp temples with a wad of handkerchief . Bale clenched his fist loosely and stared at the tiny pearls of sweat which hung between his knuckles . " What do you sometimes wish ? " " In the future , there 'll be things to do . Things better than Hodgen 's or Smith 's way , or stinking boxes of bran . Praise Peter , and I 'd like to see the day . And no more wars , " he added . " Dan , the wars will be done . " Bale laughed scornfully . The doctor lifted his head . " Folks felt like you , maybe , before the days of William Harvey . Yes , years before Ambrose Pare . Dan , I 'm thinking you never heard tell of Ambrose Pare . Yes , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying the same thing . I 'd like to see this far future , if I could . " " It wo n't be better . Anyway , I was n't thinking of potions and cure-alls . " Duffey sighed . He began to polish the stained nap of his silk hat . " I 'm thinking of them . Oh , they 'll have ways for Emmy Funk 's tumor and for Quagger 's gizzard , if that 's what ails him . " Bale swung around and stared defiantly at Duffey . " Where did you see Elmer Quagger ? " " In my office . He came . " " This morning ? " " Why not ? It 's a burning sensation , he says , and much gas to bother him . I wondered about his pylorus ... more likely it 's bowels . I came near trying a purgative enemata , but gave him oil instead . " He returned Dan 's gaze , mildly but shrewdly . " You leaped like a goat when I said his name.  |p200Do  n't tell me you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile of sorts . " Your humor is more than quaint , Doctor Duffey . Sometimes it smells to high heaven . " " I wish I knew what was worrying you . " " Possibly my status as a Copperhead . " " That 's not it , indeed . I 've been accused as a Disunionist myself ... Quagger has changed his lodgings , " Duffey added . Dan said nothing . The doctor gazed kindly at an orange thicket of tiger lilies beyond the fence . " He used to live with the Frielings . But they asked him to move , Saturday , and I do n't know where he 's living now . And did you hear what they 're telling about Quagger and the rebels ? " Bale stood up . He exhaled deeply , and jammed his hands into the pockets of his pantaloons . " No . And what 's more , you will not hear me ask . " " He talked about the misfortunes of Governor Vallandigham , and the rebel officers said that Vallandigham was a traitor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans . Poor Quagger  --  north and south hates him alike , but if you 'd prefer me not to talk of it , I wo n't . There 's no need for you to fizz up the way you do , Daniel , boy . " The silence lay between them , stupid and unwieldy .. . Old Salt was not tied . He took an explorative step or two ; the buggy squeaked . " Whoa , " Duffey called , and the horse stopped . The doctor set his hat on the back of his head and stood up . He looked squarely into Dan 's eyes . " He asked me a question , " he said , " about you . " " Who did ? " " Quagger  --  who else ? He asked if I knew you well , and I said I did . He asked if you was a man who 'd kill him because he had wronged you , and I tried to get him to tell the wrong , but he would never do it . He said it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was angry. rTHE CHAMBERSBURG PIKE 201p201I 'm thinking that his ailments were true ones , but there was a disorder of the brain behind them all . " Dan rubbed his thumbs up and down his suspenders . " Why did he move from the Frielings ? " " The rebels  --  or maybe a straggler or two  --  stole their chickens . Before that , they had n't minded about Quagger 's sympathies , political and all . Maybe they suggested he had given the chickens to the rebels . . . I admit it sounds like a joke to be laughed at . And he looked shabby and unshaven , as if he had been sleeping in the woods . " The old man slid out a pink tongue to moisten his lips . " I 'm your friend , Dan Bale . It was me who helped you into this world , and I feel responsible . I 'd like to have you tell me how Quagger could ever be wronging you . " Dan exclaimed suddenly . A long dust cloud was pushing up the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his tracks , and pointed . Together they stared through the writhinglines of heat . " Sakes , " Duffey whispered , " it 's the rebels come back again . " " But they did n't go south . They marched to York . " " This is them , you can wager on it . " The old man said : " This war , Dan . This  --  armies crowding in the roads , overrunningall creation . It 'll be the death  --  " Dan cried , " Look there ! " Far beyond the Fairfield road , beyond Long Lane and against the searing fog of Granite Ridge , a little wad of horsemen was emerging from the welterof the parent cloud . They headed rapidly across the fields . Now they could be seen swinging from their horses , lifting rails out of a fence , breaking a path into the sprawling pastures . . . The two men rested their elbows on the picket railing . From an upper window , Mrs. Knouse was yapping , " Daniel  --  what is it , Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered whether the woman had been hiding behindlimp curtains , straining her ears to listen to the conversation in the yard.  | " They 're Union , Doc . Nationals . " Duffey said , " There 's none about . They 'll be more rebels , more and more . " He asked himself , and was Elijah Huddlestone caught by them ? They came out of the south , the south and " I can make them out . They 've got blue uniforms . " " You 're right , by God , " breathed the doctor . " And I 'm happy it 's so . I was thinking about Elijah . " Dan nodded , without turning . " Yes . If there were Nationalssouth of here , perhaps he has n't been gobbled up . " Adam Duffey put his hand on the younger man 's bare arm , pressing his broad fingers deep into the firm , hot flesh . " Before it 's too late to speak , I ask as a friend that you 'll be telling me what the to-do was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doc . Let it be . " A dozen soldiers swung out along the Fairfield road , their horses at the trot . The remainder of the advancing troop stopped for a moment beyond the roadside fence ; horses huddled in a close , milling group as if they whispered horse secrets ; then two men sprang down and began to tug at the rails . Now you could see the shimmer of their faded blue breeches , hear the muffled hoofs and all the sound of their deliberate approach . Two harp-shaped elms beyond the field were tranquil , motionless : the sun made feathers of their highest leaves .. . an officer said something , metal and unavoidableword , a word said for the millionth time . Behind this clustered outpost , the shallow wheat fields seethed with the smoke of travel , travel  --  more horses then had ever trotted those roads before . The sound this army made was not the dull , portentous murmur of a Confederate brigade coming over McPherson 's ridge on a dark afternoon . The valley throbbed with echoes ; men squawked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness , and no caravans of plunder came gypsying behind . Duffey said , with conviction , " They look like they wasp203expecting war any moment . Indeed , they want to see it come . " Bale turned , and looked searchingly toward the Fanning house : Demon was out in the garden , a squat brown shape , rooted there forever . The upper windows shone hot and glassy . . . no one moved . " I wonder if these would be Tyler Fanning 's men , Dan ? " It was a brutal truth , but his simple question made Daniel suddenly angry and hateful . " What nonsense , Doc , " he heard himself snapping . " Tyler 's in the infantry ! " The dust wound close above the southeast world , a long stair-carpet over the road from Emmetsburg . Inside her house , Mrs. Knouse was scampering about like a beetle in a box . They heard her limpingsteps , the quick gaspings and exclamations she made to herself as she hastened to perform some suddenly important chore . She popped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union ones , Daniel  --  I heard you say so . Maybe I can put my bulb-roots back out in the garden where they ought to be . The Lord sends us now a quick answer to prayer . " Then she clapped the door shut ; the nearest soldiers were hunting speedily across her weedy pasture . Their horses were all chestnuts except for one gray . Eight men  --  tight and squat in their saddles  --  the survivors of the herd which had cut across from the smoky farms behind . Duffey swallowed . He loosened his clutch on a spear of the white fence . " I 'd best be driving old Salt out of this before he gets scared , " he said . " Who 'd ever expected to see these soldiers , an hour ago ? Good day , Dan . " And when he had climbed into the carryall and had lifted the reins in his scarred , pink hands , he cried : " According to Elijah , this is what they 're calling a vidette . They shoo them out along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word  --  vidette . " Old Salt started warily down the Pike , forgetting the nagging flies , his ears stiff and pointed and cocked forward as the squad of cavalry came at him.  | The carryall had passed before the soldiers emerged from the field , and Duffey was pleased that they did not challenge him . To him their advent was an annoying complication , but minor to the riddle of personal relationship . Whenever he tried to clear his brain of the jogging , dusty shapes which his eyes were putting there , he could only realize that he had told the whole truth about Elmer Quagger , and had stated his questions to Dan as openly and simply as was possible . Here existed an inexplainable rift and barrier that did not come from the years of disassociation . It was no outgrowthof Minnesota prairies or the life which Dan had lived there . Strangely enough , Duffey kept thinking of a love affair . If his friend were experiencing one , there was no understandinghow Quagger could in any way be aware of it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty schemings nurtured by the Copperheads , the Sons of Liberty , the Knights of the Golden Circle  --  call them what you would . Such was not his way , could not be admitted among his beliefs . . . The old doctor was as dully depressed by Quagger'sunhappy insinuations as by any relapse or lack of progressnoted among his patients . The world gaped at him , stained and unappetizing . He disliked the war partly becauseof the obtrusive patriotism which it had fostered , and partly for reasons of vague but earnest humanity . The war had occupied him , nettled him , overcome him for more than two years , and thus he welcomed the home-coming of Daniel Bale with supreme enthusiasm . . . That enthusiasm had never been justified ; he had seen little of Dan during these weeks ; he found him complex and stupidly preoccupied , a man whose very sternness and adult rigidity made him unapproachable , and thus unsatisfying as a friend . He thought , you can not see all that 's going to occur , when you sew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotted quickly up the slope , and when Dan went to the front gate he could see them sitting their horses against the polished western sky , just as he had seen the Secessionists bulking there a few days earlier . Old lady Knouse , the eternal Knouse on her front porch , asking questions , wanting to know things she knew already . " What went with those soldiers , Daniel ? " " They 're up on the hill . " " Maybe more will come , " she nodded . " Doubtless we 'll get our share , " he told her , and she scuttled back into her house . He thought it odd that she should have a bread-knife in her hand . He could hear a faint but persistent cheering in the village . The Union troops were being welcomed as saviors , as protectors who came from the President himself to right whateverwrongs the rebels had visited upon these innocent people . Bale wondered what would happen to the stragglers whom the old cobbler-constable had seized on Friday night ... they would be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange occupation for men with minds : tag and tag again ; you are tapped by a hand , you are ( lead ; another personis tapped , and he is wounded ; the prisoners are tapped and tagged and led away . He walked out into the road . Most of the cavalry squad had vanished over the hill , but two men still waited at the summit , dismounted , with horses standing beside them . From behind , down past Stevens Run , rose the rapping of hoofs ... Stevens Run .. . Thaddeus Stevens was far away from his town , now , and Dan thought how surprised he would be if he knew that soldiers were trampling past his home . Some day Thaddeus Stevens might be even more famous , and people would hear the name of Gettysburg because he had lived there . . . A single rider swung around the curve ; the earth exploded in loose puffs as each hoof touched the ground . Still at that easy gallop , the man passed . He was an officer ; he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drenched with sweat . He glared hawk-like at Bale as he churned by . More hoofs , back in the town , an increasing rumble and hullabaloo , and more troops coming . The head of a long column bulged around the turn . The oncoming troops did not lope with the free menace of the rebels ; they were uniformed more consistently , they held together in a firm double-file and bright guidons snapped , tiny triangles above their heads . White haze boiled high . You knew that they had ridden endless roads , had drawn their dark blue lines up and down map after map , with inexhaustible gallons of the same blue ink behind them .. . Closer . They began to be men , even in the heat : individual bodies had been the raw material of which this military mechanism was constructed . They possessed mustaches and legs and stomachs , and one had come from a cow barn and one from a glass factory , but now they were of a tested standard . Choking clouds whipped and billowed around them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal and horseflesh ; still it could not hide the pride of their shroudings . Blue , government blue , hot and heavy goods , wool which was too thick for any need , they steamed inside its firm , buttoned folds . Closer , closer , two and two and two forever , with the gaudy notches of their guidons flicking on ahead . They had no faces . . . this was Tuesday . . . no one could ever tell how so much dust had been born since that wet Friday , the Friday which seemed so long ago . The clay was dried by days of sunshine . Now its smoke rose up , pestled and pounded , to wash every human line from the faces of men . Their mouths were wet scars in the plastered blankness ,  |p207for  eyes they had twin holes . Every soldier with a beard had become a patriarch , a hoary Methuselah . In the town , a brass band exhorted with full confidence. ... mandatesMake heroes assembleWhen Liberty 's form stands in view ... Far and near you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , but still there was no one in sight except Demon and an hysterical Cybo who danced and pirouetted in the yard . . . Nothing settled yet , he thought . We 've laid it all on the table , after some foolish parliamentarylaw . But here is part of the army , and what if the Seventy-second Pennsylvania should come , ho , to the wars ? All the bordering fields were drinking up a saturation of disturbed dust . You could not breathe without drawing heated particles against your nostril linings . The cavalry moved more slowly in the Pike . An order came relayed down the steaming river of men ; distantly , a bugle uttered its piercing stammer . There was sudden , oppressive silence which ticked in the ears , and the column stood there halted on the road . Men twisted their stiff shoulders , began to cough and murmur . Almost directly in front of the gate , lifted a cry : there he goes ! With a jingling crash , a horse pitched forward and lay shuddering , its fore-legs doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blue rider had leaped clear as the animal went down ; he stood with his great , curved saber trailing , wiping his face and gazing down at the mound of ruddy flesh beside him . " What 's the matter , Bryce ? " The man answered , " Too damn hot , sir . " Other cavalrymenpressed aside , giving room as an officer rattled along the ditch . He swung down ; with the private , he bent over the horse . Dan called across the fence . " Do you want some water ?  | " Yuh . " They did n't turn for a moment , and when they did it was to face him with those same inhuman false-faces of grime and sweat . " If you 've got an old cloth handy  --  " added the officer . When Bale came back with the bucket of water and a piece of torn quilt , the column was moving up the hill and filing left through a fresh gap in the fence , across the seminarycampus . High on the ridge among the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candied flake that could have no reality , no concern with worn-out horses which slobbered in the road . Still the troops came riding out of Gettysburg , and swung trampling to one side as they passed the stricken animaland the solitary man beside it . Dan said , " Here 's the water . If you soak this old quilt and lay it over his head  --  " Thick bubbles were swelling from the horse 's nose ; within the shiny body its intestines rumbled and growled . The trooper looked up at Bale , and shrugged . Eyes like little gray pebbles . . . he was much younger than Dan , younger than Elijah . " No use , mister . He 's done for . I 'll have to ketch a remount . " He drew the carbine out of its holster by the saddle , swung it against his shoulder , and held the muzzle close to the gelding 's ear . The report boomed out , slapping upon all nearby hills ; a scatter of dust mingled with powder smoke as the bullet drove through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to press itself deeper and deeper into the warm gray bed where it lay . . . gas inside its body still burbled . Thud and clatter , the soldiers skirted past . A deep voice called , " Get that critter outa the road . " The dismounted man was bending down to unfasten the saddle-girth , the holster , haversack and roll of blanket ; he did not look up or reply to this order . Dan set down his pail of water and went out to help . " Do n't you use a martingale ? " he heard himself asking . The soldier said , " Not us . They 're all right for new recruits , " he added scornfully . He dragged the girth from under the prostrate carcass and piledp209equipment in front of the gate . " Wait 'll I git the bridle , mister . " And when he had done so , " Now if you 'll ketch holt with me . " Each took hold of an outflung leg ; two other men swung down to help them ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . there were little foamy pools where the horse had lain , and scarcely any blood . " Thanky , " the soldiers said to Dan . " Mind if we have some water ? " They grouped around the pail , drinking very little , coughing , garglingthe water and spitting it out upon the ground . Bale told them , calling through the white haze which drifted between : " There 's a pump around in back . Tell them they 're all welcome . " He went up the path and into the house . It was cooler the instant he had stepped inside the silent , brick-walled rooms . Somewhere a clock was ticking .. . This house , my house in Gettysburg . Grandfather lived here , he lay in that room in his coffin . . . And now the memory was a legend , and nothing else . He was drinking , in the kitchen , when he heard somebodytramping up on the front porch ; the mosquito-bar door rattled as a fist knocked against it . Still in his damp undershirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glare outside was a gaunt , bearded man in uniform , his sword scabbard caught up in his gloved hand . " Hello , " his nasal voice was calling , " hello , inside  --  " " Yes ? " Dan asked . The man reached for the door handle . " Sorry to disturbyou , my friend , " and then he was inside . An officer , with dull gilt leaves in his shoulder-straps , and the meal of dust lying over him . He bent forward , whispering as he nodded toward the staircase . " I make bold to ask your momentary kindness , sir . If I shall not disturb your family  --  " " There is no one else here . " He nodded rapidly ; his hazel eyes peered sadly out of caves in his yellow skull ; there was something of a schoolmasterabout him , and something of a grim wood-chopper asp210well . " Glenn 's the name . Major Titus Glenn , Gamble 's brigade . " One hand fumbled with a plump leather pouch attached to the side of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got an old wound that 's bothering me ; it 's the very nuisance in this heat . If you will be so kind  --  " You will not deny me , his eyes declared . You dare not . For all the mildness of my voiceDan said , " My name 's Bale . You 're quite welcome to anything I can offer . " " I sha n't trouble you for long . " Already he was unbucklinghis belt ; the saber banged against the floor . " Just give me a basin of water and show me the way to your privy . " " Privy ? " Dan heard himself repeat the word stupidly . " I want to do a dressing . " " You 're welcome to the kitchen . " Dan felt all the embarrassment of a country gawk ; the officer walked behind him , and he was unfastening his blouse . " I have bandages with me , " he explained , " but try to find a surgeon when you want him ! " In the kitchen , Bale dipped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner shelf . The last time , he thought  --  the last time a wound was dressed in this room .. . oh , thin red wound , and never made by a war . . . When he turned , Major Titus Glenn had removed his blouse . He unloosedhis suspenders and pushed the wad of trousers and drawers down from his hip joint , though he kept a tail of ragged shirt shielding his nakedness . He said , calmly , as if he had said the same thing in many other kitchens : " ' Scuse me . " He rolled his shirt high . There was a deep-drawn , brownish , hole at the left side of his lower abdomen , and another opposite it in the back . Through the wounds a single linen thread had been pulled from front to rear , and was tied in a limp bow-knot at the side of his body . Dan made a sound . The officer noddedp211quickly . " First , " he explained , " they used what is called a tent . Then a seton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this linen string . I was lucky and escaped peritonitis . " The flesh around each wound was rubbed raw in an irregular and scabby circle . He had opened the leather pouch , it was filled with clean rags ; he moistened a scrap of cloth in the water basin , and dabbed it lightly over the sores . " God , " Bale said . The deep eyes peered at him . " It was a musket-ball , fired in the dark . I had no business where I was , wandering outside our lines . " He bent once more to his task . " Do you think there 'll be a battle here ? " Major Glenn tossed the soiled wad of cloth into the wood basket beside the stove , and took up a second piece . " That is hard to say , Mr.  --  what is your name , once more ? " " Bale . " " Mr. Bale . No , there 's no telling . I heard that some rebel cavalry was in the vicinity . We 've got men out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise any of the enemy 's pickets we might have some fighting . It 's hard to  --  " The last word blurred on his lips ; he had trouble holding the saliva in his mouth , bending down as he was . " What troops are these ? " " This is the First Division of the Cavalry Corps , commanded by John Buford . Keep an eye out on the road ; you 're apt to see the General . lle 's a smart figure of a soldier : still a young man . Watch for a trim man with a yellowishmustache . A clever soldier  --  " He fumbled for the leather sabretasche , and brought out of it a folded square of soft cotton which he packed into the hole in his front side ; he pushed another cloth against the posterior wound , and tied a long strand of white rag tightly around his abdomen , holding the makeshift bandages in place . The room began to smell of human sweat and the thin , branny odor of serous secretion . " It is Christian fore- bearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrusion . " He rearranged his clothing , and seemed to don a new gravity as he buttoned the heavy blouse . " You 're a Union man , I presume ? " he asked with too-conscious ease . " A Pennsylvanian by birth . " " Married  --  and the father of numerous children ? " There was a sly falsehood in his chuckle . Dan said , " No , I 'm not married . " He breathed audibly for a moment ; you could hear his breathing and the officer 's , mingled together , striving one against the other . " I am unalterablyopposed to any kind of war . That is why I 'm not in the army . " " Ah , " Glenn exclaimed sharply . The front door slammed , and a man thudded into the hall , his spurs dragging . " Major ! " The voice was taut , starting echoes through the high rooms . Glenn pivoted . " Yes , Billy , " he called . A scrawny youth came rattling into the kitchen , heedlessof the dust which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bony hand was playing nervously with his holster flap . He looked curiously at Dan , then stiffened and saluted the major . His arm snapped down . " Colonel Clendenin was wondering about you , Pa . He sent me back . The whole brigade 's deployed to the left of the turnpike , on this ridge and the next . " The major drew his belt tight . He picked up his whitenedhat , and bowed coldly at Dan . " This is my son , Mr. Bale . Lieutenant Billy Glenn , also of the Eighth Illinois , Gamble 's brigade . " Billy muttered a word . His eyes were hazel as his father 's , but opaque and chilly ; they were the eyes of a killer , ruthless with all the hatred of nineteen . " We 've dirtied up your house , I 'm afraid , " apologized the elder Glenn . " That 's all right . "  |p213Clatter  , squeak of leather , the father and the son went out to the front door , and Dan followed slowly . A line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all small and enormouslyloaded with anvils and tubs and protruding bars of metal . " The farriers , " remarked the major , idly . " I did n't think they 'd be up yet . " Two horses stood in the yard chewingat the grass , reins trailing ; one was the major 's ; he climbed stiffly upon it . Light as a mounting Sioux , Billy was on the back of the sorrel gelding . He juggled the single rein and squeezed his knees ; the sorrel whinnied nervously , swung high on its hind-legs , dropped its fore-feet and headed toward the fence , head low . It flashed over the short pickets , slipped on the dusty grass of the ditch-side , but rose before its belly had rubbed the ground . One creature , horse and boy , they galloped up the hill past the row of rumbling carts . " Billy 's dug up your yard , Mr. Bale . " " It does n't matter , " Dan told him . He wondered through how many eternities he would be saying those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinned and ached in his ears . There was some commotion next door . . . Mrs. Knouse 's voice shrieked up  --  she was laughing , a delirious old-lady screech . She stood on her porch , a huge basket on her arm , and around her crowded a mob of soldiers to whom she was giving something . " I 'd just like to give every boy of you a nice piece of bread-and-butter , " she cried . They laughed without humor . " Lady , if you did you 'd spread more butter than ever woman did before  --  " The major did not look toward them ; he was settling his boots in the hooded stirrups , loosening the belt about his waist , and trying to make himself comfortable in the saddle . He flashed one glance at Dan  --  a shaft of baffled disapproval . " You 're fortunate to have your son with you in the same regiment , " Bale said . Glenn swung his hand against his hat rim . " I did havep214three , " he said . He cantered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rode away up the slope without looking back . By six o'clock , Bale estimated that at least three thou sand men had passed along the Chambersburg Pike and through adjacent fields  --  more men than he had ever seen at one time before . They were squatting on the seminary campus , in the upper end of Fannings ' pasture , and all ; long the Fairfield road . Dust had risen , a solid blanket to lie hum valley wall to valley wall , and every tree baked in its pow. dered coating ; beyond Oak Ridge the stirring of the soldiers and their horses could be heard  --  a constant , muddled resonance as of untold tribes gossiping and herding together . Dan bathed and put on clean clothes , but he had no great appetite for food . Nor had he eaten well since he returned from the west ; when he looked at his naked trunk there were bones which he had not seen for years . In the yard , his pump kept up its patient gouging . A hundred buckets had been filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust their heads beneath the wooden spout , and still they came . A noticeable path had been tied . den deeply through the new-cut weeds , marking across the rear lot to the rail fence , and another path marred the ( runt yard . Men came booted , in neat jackets , in stocking feet ; men in putrid undershirts , hard-faced youths who chewed tobacco . The windlass at the Fannings ' creaked endlessly , but Mrs. Knouse made it plain that bread and butter were the extent of her offering to the National army . She scam. pered back and forth from her larkspur bed to the front gate , warning gangs of water-seekers away . At first she tried to make apologetic explanations , but in the last hour het voice had grown raw , angrily peremptory . Now  --  now , she was hooting as fast as the soldiers appeared : now ,  --  now , youp215men stay out of my lilies . It ai n't no need for you to be here ; you get you a drink some place else . Dan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better part of an hour standing inside his kitchen window and staring across the open field : she is caged over there , I am caged here , by the hateful circumstancewhich has come to us both . . . He knew that he would need an authentic excuse , to cross to the other house , but every impulse demanded that he go to his woman at once , and share the menacing passage of time with her . Cybo had been jailed somewhere , out of sight ; Demon went limping on foot to the village , and returned almost immediately .. . The sun moved into the top fringe of Oak Ridge trees . Excuse or not , with no palpable necessity  --  Dan could wait no longer . He shut and locked front and rear doors ; the side door had not been used for years , it was painted shut and probably nailed as well . Holding himself to a lounging stroll , he crossed the field . A gray mule with a U.S. brand and a ghastly sore on its flank , was poking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path , glaring at 1 ) an with rheumy eyes . He threw a clod , and the mule stumbled aside , braying horridly . On the high expanse of grass near the seminary , wagons were arranged in park  --  a wall of soiled canvas covers before which the men shuttled like actors on an arranged stage : actors who were not certainwhat their lines might be , or what business they would be called upon to perform . Demon huddled on the kitchen step , sullenly watching the soldiers who ringed about the well . He stood up , blinkingat Dan as if he too were suddenly become a stranger . " Mist Fanning he sick , Mist Dan , " he mumbled . " Sick ? " " A bad misery in he head , and now he got pain heh . " ' fhe old negro patted his stomach.  | " Did you get hold of a doctor ? " " Miss Duffey she say Doc gone out to Culps ' , wheh somebody sick . And maybe he stop see bout Miss Wade baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got boy baby , Mist Dan . Huh man , he soldier . " He meant the elder of the Wade girls ; Dan remembered ; she had married a man named McClellan . There was a baby , born the day the Confederates marched through .. . out by the well , an old Irishman with a pleasing baritone was singing Lula , Lula , Lula is gone . Irene called from the kitchen , " Come inside , Mr. Bale . " The windlass crunched , wrapping its links tight on the wooden drum of the well . Dan entered the house ; Gretel was rattling dishes in the pantry . . . Irene , I can not even take your hand , he wanted to say . The noise of the encampment stuttered through all bounds of hearing . It seemed that this was a bizarre picnic , a male nation loosed amid the austere woods , and frightening all the birds away . " How are you people standing all this ? " Dan asked . The woman 's eyes were holding pain and weariness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill . " " Demon told me . Do you want me to go and find the doctor ? " " It 's inflammation of the  --  abdomen . He 's had attacks before , and the strain of this week has brought it on again . Mrs. Fanning is with him upstairs ... No , " she said , " he seems better within the last hour , and perhaps he wo n't need any medicine . I think he 'd be better without too many drugs to upset him . " Her eyes fell away from his ; mechanically , she motioned him on into the sitting room . He said , " You and Mrs. Fanning must not be alone with  --  " " There 's Demon , and Gretel . We 're  --  "  |p217Tyler  's mother called down through the hallway : " Daughter . Who 's there ? " Her voice was droning , lifeless . I am greatly abused by all , she was saying . " It 's Mr. Bale , mother . " " Oh . " She ordered , with sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the well . They bother father  --  " ( A wraith of Mr. Fanning began to expostulate weakly in the distance beyond her : no , no , mother  --  they need the water , they must  --  ) In the yard , Dan approached the circle of perspiring men . He said , " If you can make as little noise as possible , it will be appreciated . A man is sick , in this house . " Their tanned faces turned on him . The bucket plunged down again . " Is that a fact ? " a young man sneered . " We wear out our butts all day to try and keep the rebs outa his precious farm , and now he  --  " " Shut up , Anson , " somebody said . Dan told them , " He 's not young . His son is in the army , " There was silence , then a grumble which might be assent . " Just as you say , brother . But you better station that darkey here to warn the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell ' em . " Their voices dulled down ; they worked the crank slowly , and its squeal was more evident than before . Dan went back into the house . " I will stay here , " he said defiantly to Mrs. Fanning . The girl sat stiffly in a straight-backed chair , the western windows behind her , the sun skewering through wistaria vines that darkened this room . The level light made brass of her hair , and painted the outline of her soft neck ; she wore a gown of Spanish linen , and it did not become her as well as most of her dresses . " Very well , " she said . " Very well . " No one in the room ... he bent over her , lifting her icy hands . " You do n't want me to stay  --  "  | " You know that . Not  --  here . " " I have to be with you . There is something ominous about this military business . I have a strange horror  --  " Her gaze searched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . . . I 've had it ever since they first rode past . " Her shoulders moved under their tight linen sheathing . " Do you think there 'll be a  --  fight ? " " There 's no one here for them to fight ; doubtless they will move on , by tomorrow . But there are three thousand men at least , scattered over this mile or two . As long as MI . Fanning is ill , I want to be close at hand . " He paused for a moment , but she said nothing . " Under any circumstances -- even if I scarcely knew you , it would be the thing to do . No one would wish to bother Mrs. Knousel " This was a house of ugly enchantment . Its walls stood ready to mute any common thought or speech between the woman and Dan . ( Tyler lived here : he was a baby , crawling over these floors . He toyed with his blocks and baa-lamb in this hallway ; here he was punished and fondled , long before any sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I tell you , Dan wanted to cry , events are surely sapping the life and pungency from us . The world will not leave us alone . Oh , I should have taken you away last Friday night , no matter what roads were cut by the ConfederatesMrs . Fanning came groaning downstairs . Father was a poor , sick man . She could not understand why the cavalry had felt it necessary to stop in Gettysburg ; they should have gone on west or north or wherever they intended to go . Let them be chasing rebels , that was what the State demanded . If honey boy were here he would send them packing out of the yard . And Daniel , you go out and see that they are n't stealing our wood . The moon made itself felt , even while the western sky was pink and hollow above the vanished sun . Red spot . chasing scarlet varnish , orange spotted and speckled in thep219thin woods , score after score of colored blotches : fires were shining . The bugles and the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee along the entire ridge , and forever the light horse-artillery rattled in the side roads . This division of cavalry went about secret plottings in which the country people could have no part ; even the tired horses knew plans which civilians could never be allowed to know . Mr. Fanning slept quite comfortably , and much of his pain had gone away . Downstairs , his wife read the Philadelphiapaper aloud to Dan Bale and to her daughter-in-law . Poll de Chevres , all-wool Delaines , Challies , Mozambiques  --  Pacific Lawns at **32;2631;TOOLONG the yard  --  and all to be had at H. Steel &; Son 's in North Tenth street . She remembered with approval the fine organdy lawns she 'd bought the year before , from Eyre and Landell 's . Some women , she declared pointedly , did n't feel that Philadelphia shops were good enough for them ; for her part , she thought it downright unpatriotic for ladies to send abroad for things they might as well buy in their own country . . . Irene made no remark ; she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might have been glued there . Oh , my dear .. . When Mrs. Fanning was gone upstairs , Dan wound the girl in his arms . She did not resist ; they stood knotted together for a long moment , perplexed by a thousand forebodings . I wish you 'd written that letter , she murmured weakly ... yes , I know , I asked you to write nothing yet ; it is my fault ; but if you had written , or gone to find him , I 'd feel that something had been done about it . Mrs. Fanning called over the stair rail : she wished that Daniel would sleep on the couch in the sitting room , where he could hear anybody if they tried to break in . He went first to look at his own house . No one had disturbedthe place , but there were mounted sentries padding in the road , and another battery of small cannon toiling past . A sepulchral silence had fallen over the hills  --  a silence in which wagons and guns still grated far away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the eyes . Miles to the south rose the dull reflection of other fires : more soldiers off there behind those creamy ridges . Dan wondered if they were rebels . . . The dead horse lay beside his gate , and the moonlight made richness out of its swelling carcass . He sat on the Fannings ' porch , all alone in dusty midnight . Cybo whined from the cellar . Insects hissed ferociously , and upstairs Dan knew that Irene was lying on her bed , staring at the ceiling with open eyes . It did not seem that either of them could draw warm , undisciplined breath again until this weight of muddling armies was lifted from their hearts . Back and forth , from bedroom to silver-white porch , their disordered thoughts poured one to the other , and the sprawling brigades lay too thickly and too close to them , bearing them down with cruel impassiveness . BOOK FOURJULY FIRSTr TOWARD morning Bale slept at last with the peculiar , hopeless discomfort of the sleeper who knows that some unsolved problem is looming close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet carry in them a devilish succession of accusing faces . He was awakened at five o'clock by the deliberate pound of hoofs. and crunch of saddles , and Mr. Fanning 's voice saying , " If you will come inside , gentlemen , you shall have a cup of it . ' ' Fully clothed , Dan got up from the sofa and opened the door which led from sitting room to rear hall . Beyond , in the outer doorway of the kitchen , Mr. Fanning stood wrapped in his wife 's gray shawl , and still wearing his nightcap . He looked like a masquerader , half parson and half witch ; his eyes were gelatin in his haggard face . A tall coffee pot bubbled furiously on the stove ; its nutty odor scented the room , and even at this hour the stove fire had made the kitchen stuffy . With midday the place would be a baking hell . Fanning returned to the stove , nodding nervously at I ) an . " I felt the need ' of coffee , " he said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I crave it . Sadly . " Dan asked , " How do you feel ? " " I am greatly improved . All pain is gone  --  " In the yard sounded a mutter of voices , a clatter of dismounting men .  | " A party of officers just crossed the lawn , " whispered Fanning , " and they commented upon the odor of coffee . I made bold to offer them some . You will , join us , of course ? " " Thank you , " Bale said . " I 'd like to ret up a trifle . " He went to the farther end of the rear hall and entered the dark wash-room . Beyond the heavy , closed doors he could hear soldiers tramping into the kitchen ; men seemed to move with a thunderous tread , once they were girded for war . Dan filled the lead-colored bowl and buried his face in the cool , dark water . In the dim mirror he looked at himself as he combed his hair . He thought that he appeared very grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to shave . He would have preferred to leave by the east door and go home across the field , now that Mr. Fanning was once more astir and accountable . . . He went back through the passageway : at least he would be compelled to stop for a moment . There would be no seeing Irene at this hour , and he was glad that he could not see her until he had established a waking equilibrium . The dreams , many of them , were about her and Tyler . They were wretched illusions of weepingand of death . The kitchen seemed stuffed with uniforms , although only four men had come in to accept Mr. Fanning 's invitation . A short-necked officer with a wide brush of sandy mustache , sat beside the kitchen table ; he wore the stars of a brigadier-general , and his inferior officers stood across the room , helping themselves to cream and sugar . . . The general nodded at Dan ; his square hand stirred briskly the steaming cup before him . " General Buford , " said Fanning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned to the staff officers . " Are you gentlemen getting sufficient  --  ? " Their boots scraped on the white floor . " We 're coming first rate . " Buford poured out a saucerful of coffee and lifted itp225to his lips . His parched eyelids closed momentarily over eyes strained by wakefulness , the eyes of one who was very tired . " Good coffee , " he murmured . " I have been ill , and was making some for myself when you passed through the yard . I  --  " " We should n't levy off you , " the soldier said . Mr. Fanning-choked in his cup . " My pleasure , General . My only son is with the army . Captain Tyler Fanning , the Seventy-second Pennsylvania Volunteers . Perhaps you have met him ? " he asked . A young officer snickered , and Buford shot a hard glance at him . He put down his saucer and poured more coffee from the cup . " I do n't believe I recollect the name , Mr. Fanning . " Outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " droned a voice . A man in blue stood beside a gray mare , grasping a net of bridle reins in one hand , and in his other the pole of a brief flag which flashed crimson in the climbing sunlight . The folds twisted in and out , winding , unwinding against the staff . A numeral : z . Mr. Fanning nodded toward the door . " Your man outside  --  thestandard-bearer or orderly or whatever he may be  --  will he  --  ? " " No , sir , " said a young captain . " He does n't drink coffee . " " Morris ? " asked a major in a checkered shirt . " Why , he has religious principles against it . " No one spoke for a moment . You could hear them all sipping noisily at the hot liquid , tapping their spoons against the china cups as if they liked the sound . The captain belched . General Buford turned , gazing at Dan Bale and again at his host . He had a soiled hat balanced on his knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moisture of bushes through which he had been riding . " Did either of you see the rebels hereabouts , yesterday ? " he asked  | " Rebels ? " repeated Mr. Fanning . The general shrugged . " They we 're here , according to farmers out along the turnpike , west . " Dan said , " I was at work in my yard most of the forenoon . I saw none . " Mr. Fanning asked once more , ' " Rebels ? " His hand shook brown splashes from his cup . Buford drained the last of his coffee . " At least a scouting party of infantry . They were seen near this school up here , but they cut for it when our folks came to town . . . No , thank you . No second cup . " He stood up , twisting his tired shout ders , rubbing his buttocks . " Well , gentlemen , " he said to his staff . He turned toward Mr. Fanning . " That hit the spot , after a night in the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his eyebrows . He still wore the white night-cap . " Certainly . My wife and my  --  " " Get them into the cellar as soon as you hear any firing . " The room was still . Far away sounded the rumble of wide wheels  --  wagons or artillery , Dan could not tell which . " Firing . " Fanning 's jaw clicked . " Do you expect  --  ? " Buford slapped his hat against his thigh . He swung on his heel , facing the door ; he spoke with flat detachment , relatinga very tiresome fact . " It 'll be fought at this point . I 'm only afraid it 'll be commenced before the infantry can get up . We 're thankful for the coffee , Mr. Fanning . " He walked out to the stoop , his damp boots squeaking in leather agony at every step . His officers followed , saluting , saying their thank-yous , jingle and crunch across the floor ... a rapid thud grew into hearing  --  a horse , and galloping . " Here 's Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buford 's dry voice rapped out , shrill and curt . " Hello , Tom ! Are your videttes all in place , as ordered ? " A man on an ugly , short-barreled horse came trotting through the open gate from the north pasture . Dan couldp227sec him leaning forward , saluting , pivoting in a quick circle . Buford had moved out of sight . " General , I 've got them out , but there 's not such necessityas you think . " Through the chatter and trampling , the commander 's words found their way . " You 'll see , Tom , " he said . The officer laughed . " I 'll take care of all that will attackmy front in the next twenty-four hours . " Buford came into view again . He was forcing his boottoesthrough his stirrups , reaching forward and adjusting the curb-bit as his big chestnut wrenched her head about .. . There seemed to be a fatal weight of experience riding his body , making him appear years older than he was . Through the doorway , Bale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his shapeless mustache . The war will kill him , Bale knew suddenly . He will die of it . I am looking at a man who is close to death , and seems to know how close . " No , you wo n't take care of them , Colonel , " the general declared . " They 'll attack you this morning and they'llnne a-booming when they come  --  skirmishers three deep . 1'otu watch ! You 'll have to fight like the devil to hold out until supports get here . I only hope Reynolds is routing his infantryout of bed afore this . " The colonel laughed , with little humor but no hint of mockery . " You seem pretty certain , sir . " Buford nudged his mare a few steps forward and jerked his forefinger in Colonel Devin 's face . " I have n't been riding all over these hills for nothing , all night long . This place is damn important , and the enemy knows it if he 's got half an eye . They 'll sweat their guts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it , I reckon . " He said , " All right , boys , come along . " The whole posse rode up across the farmyard . Dan stood watching , his coffee untasted in the cup he held . He heard himself saying , " I hope his fears are n't realiled . There is no  --  "   " Listen ! " exclaimed Mr. Fanning . He lifted his palm , fingers stiff , his arm quivering under the fold of gray fringe " Listen . " His mouth drooped open . Bale turned . In the cellarway , Cybo sniffed arid scraped against the door with his toe-nails . The chickens were clot k ing , a comfortable barnyard monotone outside , but faintly above all the domestic clamor pattered the sound of shots  - -  a medley of them , so distant that they seemed half imagined . Then the blue morning fell away into nerveless silence again , and only the waking camp stirred with its innocent pandemonium . The dead horse lay in the ditch still . Its belly was swellingrapidly , and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted horizontally by the steady bloating of the carcass . From the front porch of the Bale house could be heard an increasing hum of shiny green and purple flies which crept on the taut skin or twisted in the air above . Mrs. Knouse was fastening a sign at her gate  --  a ragged wafer of cardboard hung from a stretched cord . She had printed the legend with red keel : No Tresspass . She pushed back her sunbonnet and stared belligerently at Dan Bale as he came through his yard . It was well after six o'clock ; the sun burned above the church spires and the distant tower of the college , and already its warmth could be felt on the face . " There 's too many of ' em , " Mrs. Knouse said . " I would n't have a flower left if I let ' em traipse in here after water . " " Who ? " She nodded toward the long rows of wagons near the seminary . " Them . " Bugles had talked and ordered ; hearty streams of cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond ; still the groves twitched with moving men . It seemed wholly senseless for people to en-P229gage in any such activity on a morning like this . Farmers would be cradling their grain . Bale asked the old woman , " Did you hear the shooting ? " She was molded there , a stubborn and unbelieving imagewith jaw agape . " Half an hour . or so ago , " he told her . " I 've just inquired of a soldier . He said it was a skirmish out in the picket line : they seem to think there may be fighting close by . You 'd better go down cellar if there 's any trouble . " She echoed , " Trouble , Daniel ? A war ? Fighting  --  " He went into his house , leaving her among the shafts of larkspur , bewildered by this incredible idea . The house had the hollow dampness of a brick house tightly closed for many hours . The Seth Thomas clock and a smaller gilt clock in the library were counting the minutes , stirring their hidden cogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove , and arranged a handful of kindlings in the fire-box . Yellow flame hunted deliberately along the resinous splinters , curled and mantled up through the pile . As soon as the fire was burning well , he filled the tea kettle and set it over the open stove-hole . If he intended to shave , he 'd best be about it before the day grew warmer . Something , he thought , must be done with the dead horse . If the troops were n't going to dispose of it , he would have to secure assistance and haul the thing into a field where it could be burned or buried . A few gallons of coal oil and some dry logs might do the txick . There would be an ungodly odor . Perhaps it would n't take too long to dig a hole . Out west , a dead animal was dragged far on the prairie ; the crows and the elements had their skillful , wilderness way in such matters . He thought , " A dead horse lying beside the Chambersburg Pike ! No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in arms if they learn of it . " He set a mirror in the kitchen window and went about the business of shaving . This was the window outside which Elmer Quagger had stood , so many ages before . Time was more certainly relative than ever Bale had realized ; these weeks in Gettysburg had taught him the fallacy of ordinary reckoning . Echoing years , since first he took his neighbor 's wife . . . Through the window , past the corner of the mirror frame , the Fanning house lifted amid its sheds and vines , an engraved landscape which he would see for years to come , and always with poignancy . He decided : she 's up and about by now . I 'm glad I left , and did not wait for her to come downstairs . There is so little we can say over there ; the walls come close and muffle our words , the furniture haunts us . Mr. Fanning is recovered from his attack of illness , thank fortune . I did not need to stay . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jar of preserves . He sat at the kitchen table with the food before him , and a novel he had bought in Chicago as he came east . Now he opened it for the first time . An author named Melville .. . the story was of remote islands , and two young seamen who fled their ship . Typee . It sounded like a word in the Pottawattomie language . The woman kept coming between him and this narrow print . She was saturated in the agony which she had suffered ' in his dreams ... Most evil circumstance , most disheartening subterfuge , and we have enmeshed ourselves accordingly . I wonder , she cried to him , if ever we 'll be free of ourselves . There were soldiers at the well pumping intermittently , trudging with their splashing buckets , but no hordes such as had come the evening before . Their conversation heckled through the open door . The old man sold her after that . Pshaw , she wa'nt no good for work in the field . No , I guess she would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ... one of the trimmest shapes you ever saw . Nice , round little boobies , and no feller had ever touched her before ... couple of brass guns whacking away , but we come in under them . They started to limber up and retreat whenp231they saw we meant business . Yah , I remember . Goodrich was there . Was he ? Yah , just after he joined the calvary ... in a valley beyond , in a secret place far from the harbor , men could hide forever in the flowery shade . But the valley of Typee was a place of danger . They must find another valley .. . Eight o'clock , rang the Seth Thomas . It offered its cozy announcement , a loose spring clicked , and the little hammer lay back to await another hour . Bale looked up from the book . A scrap of bacon lay in cool , white grease on his plate  --  yes , he had eaten breakfast , he had been reading . Soldiers came for water , soldiers talked and annoyed him , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainChinese crackers . The boys  --  they 've bought crackers at Pock 's store . The Fourth is only a few days away , and how Elijah and I used to trade torpedoes . Again the distant spatter of explosions like a far-away string of little red tubes , popping round-echoed under the hot sky . Dan stood up suddenly , and the chair teetered and went over with a crash . . . He was out in the yard , in the candid frying of sunlight . Bang : one lone cracker off beyond Oak Ridge . Patter , snap , bam-barn , the others retorted . Musketsand carbines ; now he knew . Close beside the seminary a bugle began to peal , startled from some sluggish dream . It was a round yellow throat , braying with spirited hoarseness . Ta-ta-tata-tatata , ta-ta-tata-tatata . Near the first trees a man roared : " No . No ! Lieutenant Pennybacker said for you to stay till you was relieved ! " Then all the futile squibs , the gilt-wrapped Chinese foolishness , seemed to mass in a single powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass felt the ground surge underneath and then lie still again . Off to the southwest rose a growing medley , yells and horse sounds , where a drift of mounted men scurried among the trees . He could see them plainly as they poured across the yellow glades of sunshine which tilted toward the crest . They were swinging from their horses : rapidly the landscape resolved itself into struggling knots of animals , little cores and festers of brown horses , flipping manes and tails , and each four horses held by a lead soldier in painted blue . A lone volcano blasted its earthy cap , out on the Pike ; again the yard wriggled underfoot . Even as Bale turned to look at the long row of parked wagons , one of the vehicles wrenched out of line and went jolting across the uneven ground toward the Fairfield road . Then the third , then another much farther along the wooden rank . The butchered air seemed to crack with the sound of their wheels , the sudden snarls of drivers , and all the slappingof dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens , chickens with cumbersome wheels instead of legs , staggering away from a shelter once friendly but now approached by the menace of a hawk . Underneath their pressuredry branches snapped on the ground , and uniformed men and men in black aprons went scuttling out of their path . In the country west of the ridge , far down near WilloughbyRun , the spatter of carbines grew more distinct . Take care , a cursing quartette burst out , where the devil ye 're ... a wagon swayed to one side , turned left and went over with a resounding smash against a farrier 's cart . One of the horses was down . Through the dust and the spasm of kicking legs , men came tumbling to cut the tangled harness . Northwest , where the new railroad grade cleaved the ridge , more bugles were signalling a repeated message . The steady fall of horses ' hoofs , trained creatures , a mechanized fragment of this remarkable horde : they were thundering up the Pike , a gun which had been left behind in the village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled for it . Twenty-four bony legs tearing into the dust , teams swam high above the road , and riders on three ofP233the horses were strapping savagely . The tawny metal tube bounded from side to side behind them . Why , Dan said aloud and to the strange silence which clothed the empty yard  --  that general was a prophet , all the time he drank his coffee . He said this would happen . Come a-booming when they comeMaybe this frantic little cannon was part of the supportswhich he had mentioned . . . A single horse skimmed up out of the railroad cut and across the field toward the Pike . Its rider threw himself to the ground as the animal halted , sliding broadside by the high north fence . He flung against the rails ; one went down , another , another  --  Dan could hear them thumping and rolling . The horses and the brass gun roared past , lathered in grit , red-striped clowns clinging desperately to the cubed gun carriage . The man at the fence mouthed : " Calif 's straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ; the churning dust wiped across in front of him ; the gun went bounding up the slope , horses and limber and all , and when the haze had drifted low Dan could see that the man was once more mounted  --  he was past the breach he had made in the fence , and pounding toward Stevens Run in a new storm of his own making . Here was war of some sort , tormenting the roads ; war which staggered with flapping , canvas-weighted wagons . Dan had the notion that he was expected to do something about this  --  he did not know what to do . Tyler should be at hand : he was a soldier , such things were his responsibility , and let the bastard be there to accept it . Mrs. Knouse wailed through a crack of her kitchendoor : " Daniel , is there going to be a battle by the seminary ? " He yelled , " Stay in your house . Go down cellar  --  mind , now ! There 's apt to be bullets flying round . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , tired insectswhispering , long m-sounds against the pale oven of the sky . Irene Fanning was not inside the house , where she be-I'I longed . She was out in the vegetable garden , slim bust and spreading width of green gown ; she was exposed to this unearthlyriot . He vaulted over the fence and ran across the pasture as fast as he could run . The lone army mule was trotting in a three-legged circle , round and round and round , with a knot of insects buzzing over the great ulcer on its flank . It lunged away from the path as Bale raced past . Demon scooted out of the barn , waving halters in his fistthe two old nags , the long-retired carriage team , cantered off with their heads held high . The fence bars were contrived for delay , for the purpose of tripping and bruising ankle bones as one sprang over them . Dan crossed the garden . The girl watched him come . She wore a bonnet with a wide , starchy brim and there were long gardening-gloves drawn over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half full of lettuce . " You 'd better go into the house at once , " he cried . " This is a battle  --  a real one . They may be all over this land in another ten minutes . " She looked at him very soberly , then made a thin smile . " At first , when I heard those big explosions , I thought workmenwere blasting on the new railway line . It sounded like that , when they were blasting out rocks in the hill . " " No , it 's trouble . More than anyone wants , I 'm afraid . " He clenched his hands , wondering at the calmness with which she faced him . " Look here , " he said , again , " you 'd better go inside . " The m 's were skating through the air , high above : invisible birds , they seemed . From a great distancecame a hollow reverberation , and as if in delayed answera ball of noisy smoke frayed up , north of the Schmucker house on the ridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan of lettuce more tightly . . . Loo , men yelled , looroo aaray , incoherent howlings , and out of their jargon launched one shriek which shafted higher , higher , a sliver from all the agony ever born in the world . Dan 's handP235clutched Irene Fanning 's elbow ; he drew her along with him . " That scream , " she whispered , " oh , heaven , what  --  ? " " I Corse , " he said . He helped her up on the stoop ; Mr. Fanning opened the door for them . His face was drawn , pearl-colored . " I believe , " he said , " that we had better take refuge in the cellar . ( ; retel is already there . " He cried , " Mother ! Mother , come clown from upstairs  --  " and hurried lamely into the front hall . Irene put her pan on the kitchen table , and drew off her gardening-gloves . " Are you coming to the cellar with us ? " she asked . Dan shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some food . If the shooting comes near , this kitchen will not be safe . " " You speak as if you knew . " " I do know , " he said . " There were hundreds killed in Minnesota during the uprising last year . I may not be in the army , but I know how bullets can go through plank doors . " She made a grimace . " Will you reach me some candles ? They 're up in the high cupboard . " The front stairway was shivering as Mrs. Fanning grunted her way down ; window glass kept up a constant vibration under the impact of artillery . " They have n't got many cannon , " Dan said . " Maybe it 's just as well for those of us who live here . " " The rebels -- perhaps they have more  --  " He stood on the wide shelf and handed down the bundle of white candles , and a glutinous block of old-fashioned matches . " No , " she said , " not those . The parlor matches are right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pressed a sheaf of loose matches into her hand , fingers I have fondled , fingers which have caressed me ... ' Thank you , Mr. Bale . " Fanning cried from the passageway , " Daughter . Where is Demon ? "   " He 's out in the field , " Bale answered . " I 'll go fetch him . " " Thank you , " Irene said , again . " I believe he is trying to drive Pansy and Pincus into the barn . " Dan told them , " Do you go down cellar . The firings coming nearer , rapidly . " He felt the woman staring at his back , felt the dull fear and increasing trouble of her breathing . He went out into the yard ; the light outer door banged on his heel , and now he could see a slow fog of saffron stainingthe green tops of Oak Ridge . The sun puffed higher , intense and mighty , a desert sun . Demon was out beyond the chicken-run . He had one of the team safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She stood on a rocky knoll , lifting her hoofs one after another , as if the soil were too hot to stand upon . " Demon , " Dan yelled , " go into the house . " " I got get Pansy , " the negro wailed . Bale said , " I 'll get her . Mr. Fanning said for you to hurry ! " He took the old servant by his shoulders and turned him around , and gave him a slap in the small of his back . Demon scampered toward the back door , his loose clothes bagging around him , his silver poll glistening . " Pincus tied in de bahn ! " he howled . " He tied , Mist Dan  --  " Bale propped the stable door with a slanted board . He caught up some small stones and sprinted out into the pasture . Pansy tossed her head and whinnied peevishly . He threw a stone : it caught her in the ribs . She turned toward the barn , and the man raced abreast of her , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden but he cut her path . Then she lumbered into the stable . He shut the door and sank the wooden bar into its notch . The last of the big wagons , a final straggle of blacksmiths ' carts , rumbled hastily toward the village along the Fairfield road . Above the constant crackle of rifle fire , and punctuated by the empty slamming of larger guns , DanP237could hear a far-away sound ... strange sound which he had never heard before . It was high , windy  --  it seemed to possess all creation which lay west of those racketing woods . He went back to the house . Mr. Fanning was pattering from room to room , closing windows , his slippers whisperingover the carpets . " You must come into the cellar with us , Daniel . " " No , I must go home . " He said , " I wish you were all over there instead of here , though the cellar itself is tiny . A brick house would be safer and less apt to be fired . " Fanning 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ! Do you think there 's a possibility  --  ? " " Well , " Dan said , " it 's war . " He drew the sofa out of its corner , hauled it through the door and into the passage ; the cellar doorway was wide enough to admit it . " ' Way below , " he called , and moved backward down the damp stairs , dragging the monstrous piece after him . He could feel long-unused muscles trying to rip themselves loose within his shoulders . " ' Way , " he gasped . . . The sofa began to slide ; he leaned forward , breaking its descent until he could rest the bottom legs on cellar stones . Then he swung the higher end around . Bedford Fanning came down slowly , holding at the sides of the stairway for support . " Mother , " he said . She sobbed , " I feel so kind of sickish  --  " Irene had lighted two candles . The gloom was thick  --  it smelled of potatoes , of long-stored vegetables and wines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was squatting on an upended box beside the wall , a roundbelliedlittle woman with padded cheeks which now were crimsoned by excitement and fear . Ach , she kept whispering , good God , Missis Fanning , and rebels come with pistols by them . " You can be a little more comfortable with the sofa , " Dan said . He looked quickly around the place . " Only two windows , and they 're small and facing the south and east . " Mrs. Fanning sighed , " Now , father , you lie down and rest . " Dan knew that she was making a most laudable effort to expunge her own dishonest misery , in the face of her husband'sgreater need . She took the man 's hands and drew him toward the couch . Her hair was disarranged ; long tails of it hung raggedly around her shoulders , and the wire ringlets across her forehead were limp and feeble things . In this mossy gloom , she appeared as an elephantine sorceress . She moaned again , " Yes , Bedford . You lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somewhere in the house above sounded a tinkle of breaking glass . A window-pane . Dan went up the stairs to bring cushions and the folded afghan which he had dumped from the sofa when he dragged it out of the sitting room ... He turned , his arms loaded , and found Irene standing behind him . " Oh , go down , " he commanded roughly . Her dry whisper came : " I wish you would stay . " " With them ? I 'd go mad . If you were with me , alone  --  " She cried his name , softly . " Oh , what is wrong ? I have the utmost horror of this thing  --  a hideous  --  " " Yes , " he said , and understanding the truth only as he spoke it for the first time . " These armies have come between us . " The room was breathless with caged summer , now that all the doors and windows had been closed . She said , " Kiss me goodbye . " He bent down . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demon scraped past the door . He had a thick book he had brought from the little shed which was his . They heard him go creeping fearfully down the cellarstairs , murmuring some few words to himself , over and over . Irene stifled a sob . " Demon has his Bible . He can not read , but he owns a Bible ; now it is a refuge for him . "  | " He is more fortunate than we , " Dan said . The windowsjiggled ; it seemed that boards in the floor were spreadingand quivering with each fresh explosion . The woman pressed her lips against his mouth , against his chin , and dragging down into the hollow of his throat . " I have brought this upon us , " she whispered with full belief . " Dan , I have . By my  --  selfishness . It is some kind of judgment  --  " He growled , " Oh , stop saying that ! " Her eyes held his for a moment ; they were set and dry and devoid of any expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a mending basket from the table , and went out into the rear hallway . She descended the steep stairs in front of Bale , and she did not look at him again . Mr. Fanning was seated on the couch beside his wife ; her bulk sagged deep in the creaking sofa springs . The man gazed up as Dan placed the pillows beside him . Candlelight gave a false color to his face . " Did you see the dog , Daniel ? " " Nowhere . Is n't he  --  ? " " He scampered out , some time ago . " " I 'll shut him up if I see him , " Bale said . " Goodbye . " The mutter of uneven firing rose into a stormy pulsation , without the barest second of silence in which no report was echoing . Dan saw Irene 's hair , froth of old gold ; it appeared finer and silkier than ever he had seen it before . . . Goodbye , the voices ached . Take care , take care . He left the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window , and dropped to the ground a few feet below . The nervousness of musketry ran behind Oak Ridge , north across the railroad cut and seemingly as far as Oak Hill . Cybo was nowhere in sight . A few chickens still scratched industriously beneath the gaunt plum trees , but most of the flock had been driven to shelter by the sound of battle . A shell came hissing from the west ; you could hear the whirring gush of its propulsion , and half see the quick cleavage of the air . Then it burst in a fan of spraying white feathers , near the Johnson house at the ridge 's crest . Inside the seminary cupola , men were moving about . Dan saw their heads waggling at the apertures , and sunlight dazzled for a moment on some brass about them . Across the barrier beyond the upper end of Fannings ' pasture , a group of soldiers gathered around something which lay on the ground . One by one , slowly , through the smoky shade and across the open green of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they began to dot the whole expanse , dragging themselves close to the trees , and still in the west you could hear that windy , wailing sound . Bale thought , it must be the wounded ; those who are hurt  --  they are making that vast crying . Christ , that there should be so many of them . A soldier scrambled over the broken fence and ran , down the slope . His face grew rapidly . . . now he was near , he was in his undershirt , and one of his arms seemed painted to the elbow . He whooped , " Let me have some water ! " He trotted past the corner of the granary , his thin ribs puffing out against his soaked flannels . " For God 's sake  --  " he wailed . There was a bucket beside the well . Dan wound the windlass furiously . The boy stood swinging his hands ; his face was marked with fresh tears . " Ma said to look out for each other , " he kept repeating . " Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that water ! " He snatched the full pail and darted off again . There would be more of them , Dan knew . He found a wooden bucket inside the open door of the carriagehouse . He emptied an accumulation of chaff and straw , drew the pail full of water , and went up the field toward the frosty , sliding smoke . The wild-faced boy had stopped beyond a heap ofP241stones at the fence corner . He was on his knees beside a flat mound  --  a man who wore a tight , yellow-trimmed jacket drenched with winy stains . His legs kept bending and straightening again as if they worked an invisible treadmill . " Ike ! " gasped the boy . He slopped a handful of water across the soldier 's face . Ike . The man had been shot in the jaw ; a few strands of damp beard hung down , dotted with fragments of white teeth ; his mouth was a spongy red well from which curdling streams trickled along each cheek . " Oh , my God , " said the boy beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my brother . " The wounded soldier said ulll , and his knees began to relax . " Our Father which art in heaven hallow 'd be Thy name  --  " the boy shouted . He raised his dirty face and stared at Dan with wild blue eyes . " Oh , look at him . Oh , my God . Oh . . . " A huge bubble formed at the openingof the shattered mouth : it broke , spattering the face above with a sticky spray . The long , yellow-striped legs stretched across the grass , the outflung hands cupped lazily . The man lay very still , his eyes looking at the smoke which spread reluctantly toward the zenith . " Oh , he 's dead . God , oh , my God , " cried his brother . He began to whine , beating his fists against his knees ... Farther up the campus , a hoarse query : " How about some of that water over here , friend ? " Dan heard a voice , deep and calm , say , " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew now , but it seemed as if he were standing back in the dooryard , gazing at this hill , this looming academy where so many theological doctrines had been learned . He thought : Elijah should have waited . He 'd have had fighting enough , right here ... He wondered where Elijah had gone , and how it was with him ; then he found himself the center of muddling men , who sobbed and gulped as they strove to suck the water from groping palms . He left the bucket with them , and went on toward the higher ground . Increasing , peppery with burnt powder , the smoke sagged in murky strands . Someone called , " Non-combatants to the rear ! " but when Bale turned he could see no one beckoning at him . Beside the seminary stood a knot of horses , patient , heads bowed , their empty saddles shining like chocolate mirrors . That same man who held the little banner with its embroidered figure r was Morris , the man with principles against coffee-drinking . General Buford must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , and Dan had a clear view of McPherson 's woods and the glitteringfields which spread away to the north . On that ridge dwelt a fuzz of toy men who wriggled from stumps to walls , who lay behind the ragged shrubbery and fired rapidly toward the west . There were no enemies to be seen , no sign of their existence save for a rose-colored cone which bobbed out of sight in the valley ahead . I 've seen a battle flag , Dan said : so that is what men follow to their death . . . Then haze went up from the wheat and down from the sky , closed togetherand shut those warring pygmies in a ruinous world of their own . Closer to the ears , the constant cry kept trilling beyond the rifle reports , as if five thousand ghosts were howlingtogether . A man crept out from the first line of trees ; he came on his hands and one knee , crawling methodically and apparentlywithout pain . One leg dragged loosely behind him ; his boot was torn half off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above his head , and a few leaves flickered past . The crawling man constructed a terrible grin of his whitish face . " No . " He shook a stubborn head . " I can make it , easy . This is n't the first time for me . " He padded rapidly past , and then turned and called , " If you 're dead set on it , there 's plenty worse wounded that need help . But I 'd advise you to retire . No place for citizens . " Dan asked , " What is that sound ? " " Sound ? " Wearily , the man lifted his hand and wipedp243the jewels of perspiration from his forehead . " Yelling noise ? " " I thought it must be the wounded . But  --  " The soldier smirked fiendishly . " Rebels . They always do that . " He crept on toward the seminary . . . " Hey , " someonecried . " Hey . Civilian ! " A thin , bald-headed officer had risen from behind a log , and was beckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the rear . Want to get killed , he was shouting  --  get back out of this . The guns exploded , exploded ... Dan came back ; still he could detect the greasy hum of bullets close around . The officer shook his sunburnt head at him . " It passes understanding . If I were out of this , I 'd not tempt Providence . " " Will they come this far ? " The officer spat a cud upon the trampled sod . " You 'll be safer in  --  say , Philadelphia . Take yourself in that directionbefore a minie bites you . " He crouched once more , and lifted the glass . Herrs ' farm , Minnighs ' farm , the Germels ' house , were swallowed by a popping , resounding fog . Out near the turnpikea battery of guns fired without a pause for breath , but all this roar could not drown the falsetto howl of human throats . . . the rebels , the wh0000 of desolation that walked with them as they drilled their way closer . Bale reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm under his shoulders . The trooper grimacedpainfully . " Well . Thought you was headed towards the war . " He leaned heavily against Dan , using him for a crutch ; he exuded the rancid odor of one who was long unwashed . They moved across a flower bed where the pink geraniums were trodden to rags by a hundred boot-heels . " Here , " the soldier ordered , " set me down against a good brick wall . I do n't want a case shot in my hind end . " Dan lowered him to the ground in a corner near the seminary door ; the sun scorched around them . " Do n't you want to be in the shade ? "   " Nope . Good , clean sunshine is the stuff for crawlers . Gray ramblers ... prob'ly you never had any . I 'll wait right here until a beautiful lady comes with a dish of brandypeaches , or something . Take care ! " He saluted weakly , then took out a jack-knife and began to slit his shattered hoot . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springing like a monkey out of a box . He sailed into the saddle of a little bay horse and went pounding up across the lawn , heedless of the wounded men who tumbled out of his way . " That 's a mighty hurry , " a cracked voice declared . " Old John must be getting his dander up ... " The surf of firing slid higher , the reports were sharper , shorter , more metallic . " There go the Colts ' , " remarked the same voice . " Ammunition 's going . " The owner of the voice racked past Dan Bale ; he stared curiously at him , then lunged on , a wizened , long-armed man with two carbines for canes . High overhead , Dan heard a sudden cry : " That 's it , sir ! First Corps guidon , or else  --  " He looked up at the cupola . An officer was leaning out , a telescope clamped against his eye and pointed toward the south . From inside the building sounded a trample of hurrying feet : General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged gloves , though the sun was cooking every grass-blade . The major with the checkeredshirt limped behind him ; he had a red-stained cloth wrapped around his groin and upper thighs , like an enormousdiaper . " Here he comes , " said Buford . A bearded man in a slouch hat was trotting up the slope , threading his horse among the apple trees , bending low to avoid the gnarly boughs which reached down . " It 's Reynolds himself ! " the major exclaimed . Bale had a clear view of the newcomer as he came past : his horse was soaped from neck to flanks , and little clots of sputum blew from its muzzle . Sad soldier ... this man who hurried under the fruit trees was drawn taut by enormous unhappinesses , blistered by cruel loads . His scrawny beard was sugared with dust , andP245in spite of the temperature he had his blouse neatly buttoned , the tight seams overlapping ; his shoulder-straps were crusty with stars . He wheeled in front of the seminary , and waved his hand . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guns sounded in a crackling welcome . Bulford ran down the steps , his spurs tinkling . " There 's hell to pay . They jumped me first thing this morning , General . Is that your folks down the road , coming from Emmets-burg ? " The general nodded . " The First Corps . They 're on the road . " He looked back across the valley behind him . " I can get Wadsworth up here in short order , behind this ridge we 're on . Do you think you can hold out until his infantry is in line ? " " Reckon I can , " the cavalryman said . Dan walked on toward the fence . General Reynolds rode toward the crest of the ridge , with Buford and an aid scrambling upon their horses and turning after him . The Confederate lines must be toiling closer ; their endless soprano drone was more distinct  --  it seemed that the hills would never be free of its wailing . Bale circled the wrecked wagon and the motionless horse which lay snared in clipped ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dead soldier lay in the same place  --  the soldier named Ike . Noisy flies were gathering above his face , and his brother was nowhere to be seen . " Gone to git him some rebels , " said a weak voice . Dan turned . A soldier sat propped against the trunk of an apple tree , twenty feet away . He had torn his shirt off , and was stuffing the rags against his bloody side . He breathed rapidly , nodding at Dan . " Hai n't you the fellow who was here with water , spell ago ? You might cover his face , fellow , so 's the flies wo n't eat him all to once't . Here , take this thing . " P246Feebly , he tried to throw his discarded jacket across the intervening space . Dan picked it up , and went to the corpse . " Martin 's gone to pick him some Butternuts . It 's a mercy -- -he 'll shoot the gravy out of any that gets in his way ... " l le coughed some blood and saliva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they come from Indiana , same as me . That 's kind of you , fellow , to cover up a poor fellow that way who ca n't help himself . How 'd you like to be et by flies ? No more would I. " Oh , Dan wanted to say , shut your gossiping mouth . Guns still built their prodigious mountain of smoke above the ridge , driving a spiteful punctuation into that approaching scream . A muted thudding passed close at hand ; one of Buford'sofficers fled through the orchard , and out over the pasture . He cut across the Fairfield road and went rocking on past the extension of Middle street . Oh , Marthy , said the Indiana trooper , and groaned seriously . A fat man in a silk hat came clambering over the fence behind the Bale house . He looked sullen and dogged in his isolation , and a brown satchel dangled from his hand . Dan ran toward him , motioninghim back . " Doc ! " he yelled . Duffey waved , but did not pause in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminary fence lay flat ; he floundered across the loose rails , and his face was reddish purple . He began , " Now , never be minding any discussion . I was n't stopping any of those men on the road  --  they 're able enough , if they can get away so neat . I thought I 'd be up and visit the invalids . " " You 'd better get out of here , " Bale said . " They 've ordered me away . " The doctor licked his lips . " This wo n't be as dangerous as the cholera . You should have seen it in Philadelphia  --  folks dying like flies , and you never knew when it would be biting you . " His webbed eyelids rolled up , and he cocked his headp247toward the man who sat propped against the tree . " There 's one bad hit , I judge . Come along . " They stopped beside the man from Indiana . " What have you been letting them do to you , friend ? " Duffey went down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's sleeve with a greedy grasp . " Do something fer me , " he gasped . " I got a ball in my body  --  " " Then you 're half a man at least , " rumbled the doctor . Gently , he lifted away the poultice of crimson rags which the man had bunched against his side . There was a purple hole the size of a dime , from which the color oozed . " Open my grip , " Duffey ordered , and Dan clicked the fasteners . " There 's lint on top . " He lifted the fuzzy mass in his coarse lingers . He winked at the anxious face which gaped up at him . " Do n't prepare for glory yet , my friend  --  you might be disappointing yourself . Unn . . . it 's through the diaphragm , if I mistake not , at about the eighth intercostal . Doubtless it 's to the left of the ensiform cartilage extremity . " He rattled the words . The ground quavered beneath them , like a crust over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never see Marthy again . That sounds like an awful wound . " He whined and shuddered under Duffey 's inquisition . The doctor said , without raising his head : " Dan . Get me some water . " And he told his patient : " Sure , you 're sound as a cherry stone . Only pray to whatever church god you want , and bear in mind that folks have come all the way from Harrisburg to let me fool with their innards . " When Bale came back with the water , he found the man lying in the shade with a bundle of grass under his head and Duffey 's coat around him ; the wound was newly bandaged . Duffey wiped his hands on a cloth . " Give our friend a drink , " he directed , " and come along . " He led the way toward the seminary with Dan bringing the water pail and the satchel . Someone screamed , " Wait ! Wait where you are  --  " A man with the face of an enraged child trotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his buttons glittering . " I 'm Captain Amos Larrabee , " he cried . His voice was wiry and girlish . " Who are you , and what are you doing here ? Who told you to attend that man ? " " President Lincoln sent me a telegram . " Duffey 's eyes protruded , hard and pink . " He said , They 're having a war out past your town . Go out and try to be the Christian you 've never been before . ' " The officer shook a white finger at him . " You 're absurd , sir . We ca n't have country doctors fiddling with our wounded ! I am a medical officer , in charge , and I order you to leave the field . " " Come , Dan Bale . " The doctor lowered his head like a bull . " I see a poor man lying beside the school , and nobody caring for him . " The captain stepped aside , his smooth jaw quivering . He shrieked , " I 'll summon the provost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Duffey grunted , " One shake will do . " They went on to the seminary . The man whom Dan had helped into the corner , was still there . He had removed his boot and swaddledhis foot in a jacket . LIe looked up , nodding , and made a weak gesture with his hand . " What have you got ? " said the doctor . " It may be the gout . " The roar came around them like water . Duffey opened the sticky wrappings : he found the foot to be a grotesque tangle of loose skin , blood and pink-sheathed bones gleamingthrough . He mourned , " Oh , the metatarsus is wrecked . You 'll be a-losing this . " The man whispered , " Thought so . Well , I do n't ' tend bar with my feet  --  least I can set on a chair to do it . Maybe you do n't know it , but I invented the first Apricot BouquetP249that was ever drunk in Chicago ... Do you want to cut it off , now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was adept at strengtheninghuman spirit when it was faint , but he had no words to greet this calm acceptance . He bound the damp mass in a clean bandage , " Find the sulphate of morphia , " he told Dan , " for I 've got some in there . I 'll give you one-quarter grain now , boy , and have you got a watch ? You 'll be needing more every second hour . " He prepared the dose ; his fingers were as steady as wooden levers ; the little bottle became a part of him , and the wounded man could not take his eyes from it . " Will it stop the pain , sir ? " Duffey nodded ; yes , it would help . " For God 's sake  --  " the man bubbled .. . " Easy . Easy . Here we are , lad . " Then the soldier drank from the pail which Dan held for him . He settled back among the crushed poppies of the flower ' bed . He droned , " Come in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago . You can have plenty of refreshment and never spend a copper . " " Do n't invite me too reckless , " said the doctor . " I 'm an old man now , but my name is still Duffey . I 'll see to you later , if that he-sow of a medical officer does n't get himself underfoot . Likely it 's his sort we read about in the papers , that feed the soldiers on calomel . " He stood up , fanning himself with the wretched silk hat . Sweat dripped from his thick eyebrows ; he smelled of other sweat . Bale said , " There 's a new noise coming out of the south . Hear it , Doc ? If Elijah were here he 'd say we were being flanked . " They started across the lawn ; the doctor waddled ( behind ; he had found his pink-and-white handkerchief , and he was using it on his face . Up in the cupola a man whistled shrilly . For a moment he leaned far out  --  they could see his brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood structure and the sulphurous sky . He waved a hand indefinitely at everyone in the yard . He howled , " Now you 'll see the Johnnies get their ass kicked . The First Corps 's coming up ! " When they moved beyond the nearest clump of trees , they could see a long parade of soldiers crawling like a snake past the orchard by the Bliss farm , a blue-black worm spiked at intervals with striped flags . They were roaring as they came  --  a deep and serious , chant , the blending of a thousand single humors and profanities . " Flanked by more Nationals , " said Duffey , " and maybe they 'll be keeping this war out of your garden , Dan . " The sun threw its resisting waves of heat across the long ridge , it contorted the fence-rows and trees , but still you could see more caravans in the Emmetsburg road  --  horses and guns , a speeding migration which sent the dust mounting . They struck the rack-backed line of mortised fence : the rails flew . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide . They came with a kind of horrid desperation ; the officers trotted beside them , all horses long since led to the rear ; the officers carried their medieval swords . They were howling , Step fast , men ! Shoot low when we go in , remember , keep your fire low . The infantry dipped across the Fairfield road ; now they were aiming to the west of the Schmucker house , and all around you heard the murmur of weary cavalrymen , half mocking and half fervent : they said , there 's plenty of Secesh down ahead by that crick , and they do n't care who they hit . Hello , Wisconsin ! . . . The head of the column swerved sharply , and a mob of horsemen raced by . The seasoned , religious face of General Reynolds again ; he had his staff with him . Muddled hoofs clipped at the hard pathway as they bunched across ; the general swung his horse to the right and reined in , waving toward the grove behind the seminary . His crisp voice above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ... left through this timber , Meredith ! Gamble will retire as you advance through him . A flatp251voice sang : left-oblique  --  and a dozen other voices rattled it in fainter echoes . Left-oblique , left-oblique . . . ha . The flags looked rich and glittering , even in the corrosion of their gilt and fringe . Blue standards , national colors , they dipped and waved as the lines swung toward the west . " Look , " the doctor murmured , " they 're all a-wearing black hats . It must be a new style . " The long , dark row sagged back , evened again . Clean ' em out , Michigan , a vast voice roared  --  here we go , Twenty-fourth ! The line seemed beaten flat , much thinner than when it had rushed forward in a column , as if those fields which it had crossed were an anvil where it was pounded to a narrow toughness . Reynolds and his staff slapped on along the summit of the ridge ; the bouncing riders kept turning dusty faces , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yapped it , back past the Schmucker house , all the way to the steaming road . Foorw000rd . The rope of men edged into the smoky shade ; the hill kept wiggling , and there was a new swarm crawling up out of the southeast valley behind them . Now you could look past the northern boundary of the grove and see the infantry stringing through the shallow valley , past the dry run , and up the gentle slope to the next stockade of trees . Again they vanished . Beyond McPherson 's ridge the wail of the Confederatesrose more shrilly ; fresh reports spanked out , applaudingbuffets from end to end of the confusion . The infantry let its first volley go , a racking gash which whipped high above the heads of the stubborn , dismounted troopers who lay crouched in their path . Duffey drew a long breath . " Here we stand , " he said , " when folks are needing me to see after them . " " Are you going to amputate that man 's foot ? " " Not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my carryall in your yard , and maybe poor Salt will be killed , though I tied him in your old stable . But I was thinking we might take some of these unfortunates down to your back porch :   it 's a handy place , and nobody is turning a finger for them . And plenty of water close by , at the well . " He unrolled his shirt sleeves , nodding briskly at his own decision . " I 'll be starting down there , Dan . You might bring that man with the foot . I 'm never one to let an honest Irishman catch the gangreneif I can help it . " He lifted his satchel and trudged across the lawn ; ahead of him , the rocky field was dotted with the figures of men who huddled , crouched and exhausted under the staring sun , or who toiled on toward the village and whatever succor they might find there . A crunching thunder of wheels was born in the south  --  the squeal of beaten horses . One after another four guns jounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the six-horse teams all dripping with dirt and foam , and men clinging crazily to the caissons . Behind each wheeled chest a long brass barrel bowed and bounced , its prolonge caught up , its muzzle low . The artillery went on toward the Chambersburg Pike ; blank-eyed boys gazed carelesslyat Dan as they passed . They were without coats , but each wore his little cap clapped tightly on one side of his head . As if performing some observance of ritual , a blue monkey-shape lifted his hand to his nose and wiggled his fingers at Bale as the last limber whistled past . Dan had some difficulty in finding the wounded Irishman ; the man had crept out of the sun and behind a stiff hedge of burning-bush near the steps . He was drugged by the morphia . Duffey must have given him more than one-quarter of a grain . He opened his eyes as Dan lifted him . " It 's O'Carna 's Family Resort , " he said faintly . " Do n't you forget it , friend . " He blew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head sagging across Bale 's arm . The weight was quite enough ; this man was heavier than he appeared to be , however many toes he had lost when the flying iron struck him . Two toes gone , Dan thought  --  if he 's lost two , it must be at least two ounces of his weight gone . Maybe four . Ile  --   |p253wondered  how much a toe weighed , and where it went when it was shot away . . . He circled the upset wagon , stepped over the jack-straw rails and went down across the field . The eternal firing had shriveled ; it could not mean as much as it had meant before . At first it bludgeoned your ears and tried to break their drums , but if your ears were tough , resisting  --  if you would not be torn by the grind and concussion , then indeed you would triumph . The spasms , the tangling doom , each separate slam of each separate gun , all would be muted as if your brain had wrapped itself in a sound-proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keening bullets which strayed across the hill . Bale thought : here we played war , here I wounded Ty fanning with a sharp weed . Here , good God , here behind this lichened bowlder I lay flat and plotted that I was Robin Hood . Here I conducted my growing self and lay spread on the ground , and looked at the stars . And at this place I filled my pipe and smoked it , and talked to Hud , and laughed at him for his prophecies . The wounded man twisted , sighing . He began to vomit ; t lie froth dripped down across Bale 's arm and splashed upon his pantaloons . It was odd to see him vomiting , when you knew that his stomach was not pierced . Dan stopped and lifted his knee , supporting the load until he could wriggle his arms into a better position . Then he went on , quartering across the pasture toward his own house . Through all the stormy world , he could make out the sound of his own pump  --  squeaking , squeaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many others went down . He wore a white hat . . . I have observedthat hat many times , Dan said , and long ago ... Heould see the hickory-nut face , the bony jaws and gummed jowls of a very old man . He thought of a jail where night rain dripped tenderly ; he thought of a lantern . " Hello , " he said .   John Burns moved out of the path . He had a longbarreledmusket in his hand , and he was coughing , with all the road dust and smoke which had settled across the field . " Is that fellow bad hurt , Mister Bale ? " " He 'll lose a foot , " Dan said . He looked at the musket . The old constable spat , and nodded . He hoisted the gun . His hands were stringy , colored with the lavender stains of age . " Now , " he remarked as if in apology , " this ai n't what I would of picked . It was a good enough gun in its day ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His eyes hunted past Dan and the unconscious cavalryman in his arms . " Hah , " he whispered . Bale turned . A soldier sat among some bushes  --  he had a wet handkerchief , and he was swabbing at the blood which sopped in his dark hair ; his face and beard were tinted from it . He snarled , " Have n't you people ever seen blood before ? Go up there and see how you like it ! " Burns told him , " I aim to go . " He went over to the man and picked up the rifle which lay beside him . The soldier blinked up at the old constable . " Well , damn me to hell . That weepon belongs to Uncle Sam , grandad . " " I 'll mind it for him . Give me what ca'tridges you got , sonny . " Blood sluiced down , wavering channels of it , unchecked and unrubbed by the handkerchief . " I 'll call you , old man , " declared the soldier . He handed up a leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go out and get your hair parted , and give ' em one for me . " The old man emptied the ammunition into his pockets . He leaned his rusty musket among the bushes . " I 'll git that later if it hai n't be stole , " he said . " Much obliged . I fit the British , must have been before your Pa was born . These rebels laid hands on me when they were here afore this , and hauled me around and tried to get gay , " he told Dan and the Irishman in his arms , and the man who sat in the weeds.  |p255This  was an explanation which he was making to all the world . " I 'd like to see ' em scorch for it . . . come fighting round our town , this way . Well . " He inserted his arm in the leather sling of the rifle . " Teamed awhile with the army down in Maryland , " he called back to them , " but they said I was too old . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He walked on , head bent , the strap gleamingacross his knobby shoulder . Bale said to the man beside the path , " Come across the fence to that brick house . There 's a doctor there who 'll look after you . " He could hear the soldier stumbling through the grass after him as he went toward the fence . He put his burden on the ground and removed a whole section of the fence , so that others might come through . Then he lifted the unconscious man once more and went toward the house , with the other man staggering behind . Already Duffey had entered the kitchen . He had brought out several pans , and a torn sheet which he was spreading like a carpet over the boards of the rear porch . " Here , Daniel . Lay him down , poor soul . And you got me another patient as well . But you 're not bad , " he diagnosed . " Not bad at all . Set down and await your turn . " He said to Bale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . " He began to unfasten the wet wad of bandage ; his fingers went fast and assuredly about their business . The man sighed , and retched again . " Now , my boy , " reproved Duffey . He squinted at the mass in his hands . It looked like veal . He poured a tin of water , and watched the red glue soaking away . The man chanted stupidly , " **33;2665;TOOLONG . " He began , his eyes tightly closed : Dominus nostri in " I 'll remove the articulating surface of the tibia and alcaneum , " the doctor said , " then bring the cut surfaces into apposition . Go fetch my other bag , Dan ; I left it on the front stoop , not knowing where I 'd go . I 've got a bit of ether . " He wiped his juicy hands . " And bring some whiskey from inside the house , some of Pentland Bale 's whiskey . Praise Peter , and he did n't live to see amputations in his dooryard . " Dan hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the road gate sat a tall scarecrow on a black horse . The rider was hatless , his face rubbed with charcoal , and one arm hung loose at his side ; he sat very still , with all the ridges rocking behind him and smoke foaminghigh . His horse was rusted thickly over the withers . The man sagged stiffly , as if somewhere in his middle was a pain which cut him , and yet held his sundered nerves together by its very intensity . " Major Glenn ! " Dan heard himself calling . " Major , come in and  --  " The officer 's head drooped sideways ; he scanned the yard and the front of the house , and seemed wondering as he stared . Then his shoulders straightened themselves . " Billy , " he yelled . He nodded toward the man in the doorway , without seeing him at all . " I did have three of them ... it 's the Eighth Illinois , Gamble 's brigade . He never knew what hit him , nor did the sorrel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rode slowly down the Pike , bending in his saddle , and the dust of artillery pouring out from the village to meet him . As the hours boomed by , the Fannings had prayed , and Mr. Fanning had read a chapter from Demon 's Bible . Lizards and tiny unnamed creatures  --  things which were damp and jeweled and scaly  --  scurried on the stone ledges , and you felt their pin-point eyes watching you . . . The man and his wife talked of their son ; they were thankful that he was not in this battle ; they hoped that no battles would overcome him , in Virginia or wherever he might be . The young woman lis-P257tened to their prayers and to the other things they said : and now they discuss my husband , the person who never made me ecstatic , and to whom I have done a cruelty . Gretel came to regard this war as an electric storm . She made Demon set to work with her , after she had discovered that the explosions would not penetrate the cellar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pickles and jelly glasses . These pears were spoiled , they oozed with smelly brine , they must be thrown out . The melon pickles could go on that lower shelf , and the jellies on the ledge beside them , and here was the bottle of blackberry wine which Mr. Fanningthought had been stolen . Under the little woman 's directions , Demon worked handily , and he divided the battle into Big Ones and Little Ones . " Big One , " he said . " Now come mo ' Big Ones . Reckon Mist Ty , he captain , he not mind no Big Ones . " Mr. Fanning found a certain comfort in the proximity of his precious carpet-bag . It was here , tamped beneath clay and brick dust , where he had buried it after retrieving it from the old cistern . . . They heard voices moaning or bawling at one another ; they heard the windlass at the well . And they crept up to the cobwebbed windows , but the windowsfaced the south and east , and all they could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence into Mrs. Knouse 's field . Irene sat on an overturned tub , close to the flickering candle , and she read aloud from the newspaper . Latest advices convey the information that General Hooker is preparing to set his forces in motion at once , or has already done so at this writing . Whether the impending conflict with rebel General Lee will be a second Antietam , seems a moot question . You could buy superior Light Zephyr cloth cloaks at J. W. Proctor 's . Harrisburg despatches declared that GeneralF . W. Smith had assumed command of the volunteers there assembled , on the 27th instant . Black dress Grenadine at Eyre and I , andell 's , Fourth &; Arch . . . She read in a slow ,   unworried voice  --  a voice which was not anything of her making , and which she had never employed before . She read many things which her mother-in-law had read aloud , the evening before , and which she did not recognize in repetition . For nearly an hour there was a foreboding lull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splintering through hidden orifices , ready to possess the entire cellar and drive them out like chipmunks from a hole in the ground , smoked and tortured . Demon said that there were a lot of Big Ones , now . . . Through the smudgy south window there was Iittle to be seen except stunted rose bushes , but one small triangle of landscape was visible , and that triangle shivered with swarms of distant ants . And near at hand endured a groaning noise which might have come from ungreased wheels , or from a daytime banshee . Irene said that nothing would hurt her . It was safe enough to go into the kitchen and dip fresh water from the pail , and bring down anything else which was needed . No , no , she would go alone ; perhaps Cybo was at the rear door , whining to come in ; perhaps that was the little agony they heard ... She went up at twelve-thirty , for all their wailing and protests , and she found that no bullets had entered the kitchen . The rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She crept into the sitting room , then to the library . Through the hot window glass she could see whole colleges of men tramping up the Emmetsburg road  --  why , she thought , it must be the entire Union army ; there could never be more than that ; they are blue and black and alive with metal .  --  They drift aside in sturdy little streams , and then bulge togetheragain , and I was right when I thought of ants . Tyler would be there . She wanted to call down through the beamed flooring : " You are wrong . Your prayers are not worth the saying ! He is here  --  the whole army is here , and this must be the battle in which he will be killed . " HerP259hands pained her . . . she looked down and opened them and saw - four sore , ruddy dents in each palm . There was order in this approach , she knew , but she could not identify it . Rapidly the uneven avalanche rolled toward the village ; they came like molasses spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Philadelphia .. . she whispered aloud , " Where on earth did they all come from ? " The house twitched on its foundations ; it was ill or intoxicated , it would never be a healthy house again . Niedes '  --  they were in the Niedes ' grain . Dust came decentlyand smothered the Niede farm and every little cluster of trees beyond ; the dust was of this valley , waiting for soldiersto come  --  it loved them , it lay upon them heavily , but they trotted on beneath its weight with their baby flags nodclingand flickering . Up through the floor rose Mrs. Fanning 's wail : Daughter , oh , daughter  --  what on earth is happening . That noise  --  She laughed wisely , and pounded on the floor with her knee to let Mrs. Fanning know that she had heard . Tyler and the entire army , or so it seems  --  that 's what is happening . It 's the Seventy-second Pennsylvania and thirty other Seventy-second Pennsylvanias ; some of them are in the Emmetsburg road and some in the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And these are cannon and they come helter-skelter , and behind our house I can hear other cannon in the Pike . The village is being possessed by all these Seventy-second Pennsylvaniasor heaven knows what you call them . Well , she told herself , I heard a car of war coming over the hills , and I could have told anybody this would happen . Dan said there were three thousand men here last night . If three thousand men came between us as they did , what will ten times that number do to him , and do to me ? Oh , at any time I would have fallen ill to see them coming , but they are a menace of the darkest order , they are poison for allP260their glistening and in spite of their speed and their banners  --  they are worse than any cancer which ever ate at flesh . BecauseI craved him , I quiver and lived my limit inside his arms , and he within mine . Heaven , she cried without a word , I wish you 'd send one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that  --  not to die . I want to live ; I want to go away ; I want to get out of this . I want to go away from this war and this town which was a quiet town , a stupid and affable place before the rebels and the rest of them came . Let me get out  --  crash this glass , cut my way through it , run across the field as I did last Friday , be beside him and hide in the wilderness . He said we should do it . Heavenly Father , why did n't I go ? Tyler 's coming  --  somewhere within these swarms he will be snarling and hooting at his men before the bullets pare him down . She felt a sodden futility , leaden through every vein . She knew the same unwieldy bitterness which had possessed her as a child , when her mother lay dead in the parlor , and she curled in her cold bed upstairs , listening to the hushed tread of servants and the sepulchral whispering of relatives whom she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy which supplanted all other consciousness . Oh , give me some sort of a prayer , she thought  --  Heavenly Father of whom I have been taught but from whom I have shrunk away ! Even give me an unread book , to carry around with me as Demon carries his . At last she got up and found Mr. Fanning beside her , bending down , crying , My dear little lady , why did n't you answer , you have given mother such a turn  --  come at once . " Yes , " she said , and went with him into the rear hallway . She imagined that the roaring multitudes who chased along the ridge were going to a fire  --  maybe they had buckets , maybe they would put it out ... " I hear groaning again , " she told Mr. Fanning . " It is close . I think out on the stoop  --  we heard it , before  --  " They unlatched the door and looked out . ThereP261were two dusty shoes sprawled close beside the door , and legs stretched down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief words , they hovered over the man . He had been shot through the throat  --  somehow he had made his way to this porch , and here he was . He kept rolling his . eyes and squeezing his tongue out through fat , steel lips . His hands had torn the clothing around his neck , and had raked furrows in his flesh as well . Aaahh he kept murmuring , a secret which he whispered to himself countless times . They dragged him up on the porch ; he was about eighteen , Irene thought , and he had a pale skin dotted with tiny orange freckles . His clawing fingers , the nails crammed with shredded skin  --  they grew from hands which were as slender as a flute player 's , and all raw and blistered by harness and guns . The gasping cry which he uttered was changing now , even as they brought him into the kitchen . His green eyes swiveled in raw sockets , and saw nothing of the room or the faces above . Then moisture came up in his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the clean-scrubbed floor , and he wadded the woman 's gown in his hand as he died . General Reynolds fell quickly and easily , without a sound . Lieutenant Steele saw him go ; he had had no premonitionof the general 's death , and it would be long before he grew accustomed to the knowledge that the well-remembereddark face , the silent manner , the alert eyes , existed only in decay and shroudings . John Buford kept urging Reynolds to be more careful . The major-general was guiding his horse among the torn mounds of shrubbery , springing it lightly over dismantled fences , pausing with his upraised field-glass at the most exposedfence corners . For God 's sake , Buford exclaimed in his tuneless Kentucky drawl , take a little care , sir . For a long time the superior officer did not pay any attention to this entreaty , and when he did observe it he only laughed . He had a close-clipped , scrubby beard , and a way of appearing neat and on parade even when the hollows of his cheeks were larded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud and manure . When troops waited on a march , and fell out in somebody 's pasture to lie beside their stacked arms , Reynolds made it a habit to notify brigade commanders if their men had time enough to boil coffee . Lieutenant Steele would cheerfully have washed Reynolds ' boots with his tongue , and accounted it a privilege . Then a soldier from Major Van de Graaf 's Fifth Alabamabattalion  --  a young man about twenty-one , named Rufus Canty  --  poked his rifle through a bank of thistles . It was a five-round Spencer , captured from a Yankee only two months before , and Rufus Canty was very proud of his gun . Forever he was trying to see what it would do . He lay a few feet in advance of his line , where Archer halted in Grandpa Germels ' east pasture , and all along the weeds his companions were firing . The reports rang solidly , in varying volume : there were Springfields and Vincennes muskets , and Colts , and Spencers , and even a few Henrys , all clanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This little nest of weeds had a cool , minty odor ; it spoke of frogs and creeping green grasshoppers .. . Rufus Canty thought of a church-meeting in the woods back home . He had wandered away with Araminta Bates , and they lay among some such weeds as these , making love until the stars came out . Araminta was afraid of snakes which might be crawling around , but he only laughed at her . Sho , he said , I 'm not going to stop loving you because of some old snake . Later , Araminta had been right scared ; she thought she was in the family way , but it happened that she was n't . He wondered what old man Bates would have done about it ... The weeds smelled like church-meeting . A couple of wings ofP263cold fried chicken : now , that would n't be bad . Dinners in baskets , roasting ears in the fire , and a big hunk of vinegar pie . The preacher chuckling to Rufe Canty 's mother , " And , Sister , I never knowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was growed " . . . he nudged the barrel of his Spencer , fondly . It was a good gun . One hundred , two hundred , three hundred yards . That was asking a lot of a gun . Of course you could take any ordinaryold shooting-iron and bang away up to half a mile , and trust to luck that the bullet might find lodgment in the ragged yeast of Yankees . But now there was no mass of purple Yanks , wheeling and sparkling ; only an elusive row of smokestabsbehind that stone fence and in the fringe of timber . On his left , Welch Myson called : " Hey , you Rufe . " " Ya . " " Yore so blame still Ah thought you was kilt . " " Ah ai n't kilt yet . " The line of hidden rifles pecked at him . He pushed the Spencer out , and rested its barrel in a green crotch of thistle . Through the higher woods he could see a huddle of riders who scouted mysteriously under the shade . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lone trees , they drifted along the ridge . Like to have me a big telescope , Rufe Canty thought  --  like that officer on the big horse . Like to have me a telescope big as a locomotive ; reckon I could see all the way back home , with a telescope like that . If I aim mighty high , I reckon I could hit that horse . He pulled the trigger , and the butt mauled his sore shoulderagain . Watching through the hot mist , he could see the Yankee officer falling limply from the horse , half a side fall , half a backward fall , and his arms flying wide as he went . The horse leaped nervously and turned , sniffing . Then dull smoke got in the way  --  blurred all the dark blue shapes , and dulled the gleam of metal about them . Rufe Canty 's throat was suddenly dry . By God , he said to himself . What do you know . He called , " Hi , Welch Myson . Jest got me a big Yank , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much hell . " " Ah hope to shout , Ah did . He was boss-back . Reckon he was captin . " Then the yell and the orders pulled him out of his nest . He plunged forward through the thistle brake , bending low , holding the Spencer tight in both hands . He began to scream with the rest of them , burning his throat by the very friction of sound : wh00000 . . . they made a few rods forward ; it began to be muddy under foot ; there were willows , bending , nodding , green tufts flying as the Yankees talked back . A solid volley chewed across their front  --  here was a new cry ahead , and the feeling of an unconscious enemy who suddenlyroused up and hit out with both fists . . . They crouched along the willows , and peeked at the ridge ahead . " Thar come them ole black hats , " Welch Myson squawked . " That hai n't no milish  --  hit 's the Army of the Patomack , shore  --  " Reynolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the little , spiteful slap of the ball , and the next instant the general was on the grass ; he seemed to bounce as he struck the ground . Steele got to him before anyone else . He said , " God  --  sir ! " and put his arms around the firm , muscular shoulders . Reynolds looked rather canny and knowing ; the lids sagged slightly over his eyes , and there were straws caught in his beard , and his hat had fallen off. - There was a blue hole in the skin where his neck joined the head , squarely behind his right ear , and a larger hole in the left side of his head , higher up . Something wet and hot , a soggy scrap , fell on Jack Steele 's naked wrist . He cried , God damn dirty sons-a-bitching bastardsDead , and he had never known about it . Steele carried him back to the shelter of a big beech tree , and put himp265gently on the ground . He stood breathing from the exertion ; Reynolds was not a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mumbling dazedly ; nobody else cried , no one except Lieutenant Steele . Not just then ... The lieutenantheard the thud of hoofs approaching across the shade ; he looked up at General Buford and saw the amazed frown which drove between his eyes . " Is he dead ? " Buford demanded . " Yes , sir , " a thick voice said . " Shot through the head . Must have been a sharp-shooter . " " I 'll give you a line to General Meade . " Buford turned his horse , so that he would not be facing the prone figure under the beech tree ; he took out his notebook and began to scratch with a lead pencil . " General Doubleday 's at the school over yonder , " he said , without looking up . " One of you gentlemen will notify him at once . I reckon he 's up in the cupola . " Steele cried , " Yes , sir ! " He beat Captain Fane to his horse , and went scuttling away , the mouldy acorns scattering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , though it seemed like basest treachery to desert Reynolds , now that he was so quiet and saying nothing . And he was supposed to be a captain , himself , only it had n't come through . . . stared blankly into General Doubleday 's sirloin , thick-mouthed face , and saying : Regret to inform the general that General Reynolds has just been killed , sir . Doubleday said what-what-why , what is that , sir , hold on lieutenant , repeatwhat you were saying . The batteries over on the Pike were going full-tilt , and it was hard to deliver or receive a verbal message . Steele could never recall much of what happened , for some time afterward . He remembered that Doubleday said something about retiring General Reynolds ' body to a place of safety ; Meredith 's brigade and the rebels were fighting like fury down the hill toward that biggest creek , and
