The Russo-Finnish crisis having lapsed temporarily into the name-calling stage , big bad news in the Baltic last week came from Sweden . There the national budget , for years as soundly balanced as the Great Wallendas , was shown to have taken a terrific topple from the high wire . Loss of revenues due to wartime trade curtailment , plus the cost of keeping the Army and Navy mobilized for emergency , plus armament purchases and providing urban Swedes with gas masks and air-raid shelters , had largely done the job . Finance Minister Dr. Ernst Wigforss announced that since he reported balance to the Riksdag last January , the Kingdom had fallen in the red 600,000,000 kroner ( $144,000,000 ) . <P> The total expenditure carried in Sweden 's last normal budget was 1,340,000,000 kroner . Dr. Wigforss asked the Riksdag to authorize a loan of 300,000,000 kronor , and plans to raise the remaining 300,000 , - ooo needed to cover his " emergency deficit " by drastic taxation , particularly by upping the already high and unpopular Swedish taxes on liquor , tobacco , coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Monopoly and in angry protest at the deficit taxes last week 200 sailors from the Swedish battleship Manligheten ( " Manhood " ) returned their motbocker or liquor ration books to the State stores . <P> Sweden 's large-scale purchases of munitions , fuels , certain foods and other " preparedness goods " were revealed to have run up during the past nine months an import balance of 345,000,000 kronor , whereas for the similar period last year Sweden 's surplus of imports over exports was only a mildly depressing 140,000,000 . Since War II broke , Dr. Wigforss revealed , Sweden has lost roughly 300,000,000 kronor of foreign exchange , due partly to " hot money " withdrawals by investors who are afraid the Soviet Union will yet muscle into Scandinavia as it has into the Baltic States .
