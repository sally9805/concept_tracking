" The Federal Government can pull the country out of Depression by spending and can drop the country in again by economizing . We had to prove that by experiment because hardly anybody believed it in 1933 . Now that this relationship is proved by experience , many people still ca n't believe it . . . . " <P> This breezy solution of an economic riddle which has puzzled the world 's ablest savants for the last decade was proffered last week in Middletown , Ohio by 30-year-old James Roosevelt . If several of the Assistant President 's statements seemed a trifle brash , the last at least was indisputable . So many people still could not believe that young Mr. Roosevelt 's father 's current $5,000,000,000 pump-priming program would promptly end the current Depression that , even though Son Roosevelt 's arguments were being stated less ingenuously by James A. Farley , Henry A. Wallace , et al. , the program last week had not proceeded much beyond the talking stage . While economists , political pundits , politicians , columnists , editorial writers and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other over the vital point of whether Government spending was 1 ) the best cure for or 2 ) a chief cause of Recession , practical developments in the pump-priming campaign were as follows : <P> 1 ) Appropriation by Congress of $51,500,000 carefully earmarked for the CCC as a start on the President 's request for $1,500,000,000 . <P> 2 ) Announcement by the U. S. Treasury that it would immediately but gradually begin to implement desterilization of gold by redeeming maturing Treasury bills at the rate of $50,000,000 a week . <P> 3 ) Announcement by its chairman , Jesse Jones , that the RFC was ready to loan funds to utilities , underwriters and businessmen on their inventories ( see p. 53 ) . Meanwhile , what U. S. Business was inclined to consider the most helpful move of the week was not the Administration 's effort to pour water into the well but a Congressional effort to give thirsty Capital a drink from its own spring-by modifying taxes ( see below ) .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
