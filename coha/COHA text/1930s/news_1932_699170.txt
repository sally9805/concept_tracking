txt Those who remember Mr. WmLIAM V. Moon 's " Ode in Time of Hesitation " may think his spirit , if not his actual facts and inferences , fitted to the dubious Mayoralty situation in New York . The decision of the Court of Appeals is explained as in strict accord with the precedent of a previous case before the same tribunal . It is always hard for courts to reverse or even seriously modify a decision of their own . And of course the judges at Albany could pass only upon the questions of law argued before them . Public policy , the state of parties , the convenience or awkwardness of the political machinery which will have to be set in motion to elect a Mayor of New York on Nov. 8 , the convenience or desires of the electorate , the misfortune of mixing up municipal issues and perhaps scandals with the State and Presidential campaign this year  --  none of these considerations could sway the Court of Appeals , which was asked to pass solely upon the point of law . The judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their decision would force upon this city a most difficult and chaotic political situation , but that was not their affair . " See you to that , " appears to have been , in effect , their word to the partisan committees and the political managers who are responsible for thrusting upon New York a Mayoralty election under such unexampled and puzzling conditions . It has been pointed out , for example , that the legality of any nomination of a Mayor by a party convention at this time would be seriously in doubt . The election law of the State of New York specifically provides that " a certificate of party " nomination for an office to be filled " at the time of the general elec " tion shall be filed not later than " the fifth Tuesday preceding such " election . " That date is already past . Time is left for independent nominations by petition which could be filed not later than next Tuesday . But it is plain that , aside from these legal complications  --  around which some way may be devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken is clouded with ambiguities and uncertainties . One thing emerges clear . It is that a successful , effort to bring about the nomination of Mayor WALKER would have had an upsetting , even cataclysmic , effect . It would have disrupted the Democratic organization in this city . Governor ROOSEVELT would have had to dedare ' himself unreservedly against the Walker candidacy . It would have thrown the entire State campaign , End the Presidential election so far as New York is concerned , into a. whole series of cross-purposes and contradictions . The probability was strong against such a thing occurring . But if it had , the challenge to the sense of decency and to the civic pride of sober-minded citizens would have been so flagrant that they could not have failed to band themselves together to make possible some alternative to so open a disgrace to the City of New York . All that can be said at present writing is that there should be a vigilant and determined attitude with regard to the whole affair , with full resolve that everything will be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government of this metropolis .
