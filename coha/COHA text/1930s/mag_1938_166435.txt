WITH MALICE TOWARD SOME-Margaret Halsey-Simon &; Schuster ( $2.50 ) . <P> U. S. readers are used to Englishmen 's relentless output of travel books about the U. S. But for an American to write a travel book about England is still a novelty . Wife of a Ph.D . ( brother of Publisher Richard Simon ) who spent a year in England on an exchange professorship , 28-year-old Margaret Halsey has added enough wisecracks to make her novelty also a likely bestseller . Divested of wisecracks , Author Halsey 's English impressions are surprisingly charitable - kinder than most English impressions of the U. S. , kinder than Peggy Bacon 's illustrations , and much kinder than the satire with which young English writers them selves hammer away at their gentry . <P> In the ' ' stepmother country ' ' she found that the worst thing was " the boneless quality of English conversation . . . like watching people play first-class tennis with imaginary balls . ' ' But it saved Author Halsey from feeling inferior . English weather , about which most conversation revolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coating of moss on the north side . " but she liked the green countryside . She ridiculed the diminutive look of England ( ' ' the locomotives are only about thirty-four inches around the bust " ) , but came to like the homey atmosphere it gave . Oppressed by ' ' that death-in-life which the Britons . . . like to call English reserve , " she nevertheless liked its complement , " the cream-of-mushroom-soup texture " of English leisureliness . And reserved children , after her friends ' progressive-school brats , were a relief . <P> English snobbery made her fume , but she later decided a rigid caste system had the good result of making modest-income people immune to success stories , and hence to U. S. " bootstrap hysteria . " " A good deal in England makes the blood boil , " says Author Halsey , " but there is not nearly so much occasion as there is in America for blood to run cold " - meaning lynchings , gangsters , etc . As between good and bad Englishness , Author Halsey calls it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she concludes , " must be like being married to a stupid but exquisitely beautiful wife . Whenever you have definitely made up your mind to send her to a home for morons , she turns her heart-stopping profile and you are unstrung and victimized again . "
