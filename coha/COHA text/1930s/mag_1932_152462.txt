Moving swiftly and smoothly ahead with the revenue provisions of its billion-dollar tax bill , the Senate last week : <P> Rejected ( 49-to-31 ) " soak-the-rich " wartime normal and surtax income rates . <P> Squelched a one-man filibuster by Louisiana 's obstreperous Long . <P> Approved the Finance Committees normal ( 3% , 6% , 9% ) and surtax ( 45% maximum ) income rates . <P> Approved an increase in the corporation tax to 14% . <P> Approved an income tax on the salaries of future Presidents and Federal judges. * <P> Rejected ( 61-to-24 ) an amendment by Maryland 's Tydings to legalize 2.75% beer and tax it for a relief program of public works . <P> Approved stiff taxes on home-brew ingredients . <P> Tariffs . Then the Senate snagged on the bill 's four tariff items-oil , coal copper lumber . Progress was halted under a deluge of angry oratory . Night sessions failed to break the deadlock . Republican Leader Watson dolefully announced : " Adjournment is still a long way over the horizon . " <P> " Four and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wrote these tariff items into its tax bill . Progressive Republicans and low-tariff Democrats loudly denounced their inclusion as the result of logrolling . An apparent Democratic trade : Barkley of coal-producing Kentucky would vote for an oil tariff if Connally of oil-bearing Texas would vote for a coal duty . Hayden of copper-mining Arizona would support both levies if Messrs . Barkley and Connally would help him get a rate on copper . <P> Amid great acrimony the oil and coal tariffs were finally voted ( 43-to-37 ) and ( 39-to-34 ) into the bill . Then the Senate stalled on copper and lumber , bitterness of the antitariff opposition rose to a startling pitch . As a reprisal Senator Tydings engulfed the chamber with 504 tariff amendments to the tax bill . Shouted he : <P> " Have we gone mad ? Have we no idea that if we carry this period of unrest from one week to another , a panic will break loose which all the tariffs under heaven will not stem ? Yet we sit here to take care of some little interest in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting for the nation . <P> " My State ! My State ! ' My God ! Let 's hear ' My Country . ' What good is your State if your country sinks into the quagmire of ruin ? <P> Appeal of Eleven . So disturbed by the Congressional tax situation were six famed Republicans and five famed Democrats that they signed a public appeal for speedy action and mailed it to Senate Majority Leader Watson , Senate Minority Leader Robinson , Acting Chairman Crisp of the House Ways &; Means Committee* and House Minority Leader Snell . Excerpt : " On behalf of vast numbers of our fellow citizens , we appeal through you to the Senate and the House to lay aside every form of partisanship and quickly to unite to adopt a balanced Federal budget as well as to enact a plan of taxation . economically sound , fair . . . and without discrimination . ... It is our judgment that conditions are so grave that this action should be taken at the earliest possible moment . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
