That the grand jury 's action does not end the investigation was made clear immediately by Henry A. Schweinhaut and Welly Hopkins , special assistants to the Attorney General , in a statement promising a new and even more sweeping investigation before a new grand jury . An effort was made to obtain a statement from Mayor Hague at I City Hall in Jersey City , but his secretary , Frank Eggers , said there would be no comment . Norman Thomas , whose " deportation " from Jersey City last April 30 led to the linvestigation , was quoted by The Associated Press in Boston as having regretted that some members of the grand jury appeared to share Mr. Hague 's " Fascist views " and expressed confidence that the " excellent work , " of Mr. Schweinhaut and Mr. Hopkins would produce " better results , " next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation on Oct. 21 convened at 10 A.

" While a complete presentation was made to this Grand Jury of the facts then in hand , the Department 1 of Justice feels that , even though a I no true bill has beenreturned , a further and more intensive investigation should be made of the facts , particularly those newly discovered , and that justice requires their presentation to a new Grand Jury .
