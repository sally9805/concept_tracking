Last week the Swedish Royal Academy of Science awarded its 1936 Nobel Prize for Chemistry to a profound student of molecular structure , Professor Peter Joseph Wilhelm Debye , 52 , of Berlin 's Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics . The Prize for Physics was divided between a pioneer cosmic ray researcher , Professor Victor Franz Hess , 53 , of Austria 's Innsbruck University , and 31-year-old Professor Carl David Anderson of California Institute of Technology , discoverer of a fundamental particle of matter , the positive electron . Prizeman Debye will receive about $40,000 , Prizemen Anderson &; Hess each half that sum . <P> Dr. Debye has done powerful work on the conduction of electricity by salt solutions , the electrical properties of insulators , the heat capacities of solids , the atomic architecture of molecules . He was one of four men who turned the crystal diffraction grating invented by Max von Laue into a precise instrument which , by combing X-rays through the atomic lattice in the crystal , determines the composition of a mixture as exactly as by chemical analysis . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical Society that water has a quasi-crystalline structure , therefore resembles a diamond more closely in arrangement than it resembles its own gaseous form , steam . " We are just beginning to know what water is , " he said wryly , " although we have been calling it H2O for more than a century . " <P> Dr. Hess was the first man to see clearly that the cosmic rays were cosmic-that is , that they did not come from the earth or the atmosphere . Enthusiastic Austrians once called this mysterious radiation " Hess Rays , " just as an enthusiastic U. S. scientist later called them " Millikan Rays . " Cosmic rays , as almost everyone now knows , bombard Earth continuously from every direction in the sky . No one knew this when the 20th Century opened . About that time it was observed that some sort of radiation from somewhere was constantly ionizing the air in electroscopes . Some theorists thought the source was radioactive material in the ground . If this were so , the radiation should have fallen off markedly at short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hess , Gockel and Kolhrster killed off the terrestrial radioactivity theory . In 1911 Hess made seven flights to 3,000 ft. , found no decrease in the rays whatever . Later , nearly six miles up , he found them seven times stronger than on the ground . " A radiation of very high penetrating power , " he wrote , " enters our atmosphere from above . " <P> In 1934 , still on the job , Dr. Hess aimed his recorders at the exploding star Nova Hercules ( TIME , Dec. 31 , 1934 ) to see whether , as some cosmologists had suggested , such stellar blow-ups could be a source of cosmic rays . He did detect a slight increase in cosmic ray intensity from the direction of the nova , but too small to be of definite significance . <P> Dr. Anderson discovered the positive electron under curious circumstances . He was not looking for it , and its existence had already been foreshadowed by a British theorist only three years older than he was .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
