I Go to the Workhouse EVICTION POLICE are everywhere . They line the side . walk and seem to fill the house . They clear a path as the bailiff 's flunkeys carry out chairs , a cradle , a bowl of goldfish , and beds . Hundreds of unemployed fill the streets . They hoot and jeer as each additional piece is brought from the house . They chant dirgelike songs : " Remember that just round the corner a breadline is waiting for you . " Cops and bailiffs look sheepish , at times defiant . Children gaze in wonder . The evicted mother carefully protects from damage a framed marriage certificate . Roars of delight arise from the throng as the flunkeys burn themselves in carrying out a red-hot stove . Women in the house had been firing it diligently for the occasion . After hours of dilatory labor , the sanctity of private property is duly established and another family is on the streets . The wages paid the officials of law enforcement ( sixteen police , three bailiffs and two flunkeys ) would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STREET SCENE By mass demonstrations the Unemployed League of Columbus , Ohio , succeeded in preventing evictions all winter . With the coming of spring , however , city officials felt that the destitute could just as well live in the open . Under pressure of the exponents of " law and order , " Mayor Henry Worley sent dozens of police with the bailiffs to enforce court orders of eviction . This in spite of preelection promises : " I will not be a party to throwing people into the streets . " Often evicted families have no place to go . In such cases " street homes " are set up . A portion of the street is roped off . American flags are draped over the ropes . Tables , beds and stoves are arranged and the family lives on the pavement until a house is obtained . Such was the plight of the Smith and McGuffin families on Good Friday . Fathers , mothers and children were forced to sleep in the chill night air with only the sky for a roof . Being on well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pictures appeared in the papers . Cars stopped . Spectators thronged . " Why ca n't the relief authorities provide homes for these people before they are evicted ? " they ask . This is mighty embarrassing to city officials , especially to an administration that professed to be liberal . The Safety Director , C. C. Williams , declared the street homes to be traffic hazards and ordered them removed . On the eve of Easter a dozen police , a lady social worker and two rubbish trucks pull alongside the McGuffin " home " to perform their duty . The relief officials have conceived a brilliant solution to the problem of street homes : women and children are to be taken to the Salvation Army , fathers to the transient bureau , and furniture to storage ! The lady social worker , bedecked in Easter finery , tries to persuade Mrs. McGuffin to comply with this magnanimous offer . Mrs. McGuffin refuses to consider the plan ; at least not until Mr. McGuffin can be consulted . He has gone in search of a house . The police insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the radio to proceed with the loading at any cost . Individuals in the crowd plead with them to wait until Mr. McGuffin returns . Mrs. McGuffin faints from constant harassment . Women fan her and beg the police to call a doctor . " She is drunk , " replies one of the cops . Officers move as though to load the furniture . Women pick up tent poles to defend the meager pile and upbraid the police for their heartlessness . Members of the Unemployed League quiet the women . " No violence , " they say . The police gather to one side in a huddle . Reinforcements have arrived . Thirty or forty uniformed men are on the scene . A crowd of four or five hundred people have been attracted by the commotion . I mount a chair and speak : " Presumably laws are devised to protect the institutions upon which civilization is based . Here , however , is an example of the law being used to destroy the most fundamental of human institutions . . . All red-blooded Americans should protest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outrage ! " Suddenly the police come out of the huddle . Swinging blackjacks and clubs , they charge ruthlessly into the crowd of helpless men , women and children , slugging all who are in the way . A child is hurled to the pavement . A woman is felled by a blackjack and kicked in the abdomen time and again . Screams pierce the air . A gray-haired lady picks up a kettle of hot soup and dashes it over a cop . Several police start for me . " This is the one we want , " they cry as they pull me from the speaker 's chair . An elderly woman takes my place . She is pulled over the top of the chair to the pavement . A cop strikes me over the head with a blackjack . Blood spurts . Several cops hold me while a third slugs me in the face . I attempt to spit out fragments of broken teeth . All becomes black . I am dragged , dazed and bleeding , to the radio cruiser and thrown in like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbs , piercing the flesh . I am rushed to Mercy Hospital . " Take care of this dog , " cries the cop as he pulls me to the operating table . " And get ready for more pretty soon . " My lacerations are sewed up . I hear screams of others being brought in . A day has passed . My head aches , my eyes and lips are swollen and I can hardly eat and speak because of broken teeth . Nobody is permitted to see me . Friends , worried about my condition , are turned away with the retort , " He is doing well . " Finally a minister , the Reverend Arthur Milne , comes in bringing news and personal necessities . His transgression is discovered by Dr. D. Price , who is in charge of the hospital . He is called " a hell of a minister " and chided for " consorting with criminals . " On the fourth day Dr. Price comes in and examines me . He is curious regarding the activities of the unemployed . " Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The police put me here , I presume they will pay the bill , " I reply . Enraged , he slams the door and shouts in a voice that can be heard all over the building , " Call the police and tell them they can take this man whenever they want him . " In fifteen minutes the Black Maria arrives . Two cops come into the room and order me to get dressed . My shirt and undershirt are stiff with blood . I put on bathrobe , trousers and shoes . My head is heavily bandaged . Garbed thus , I am taken to jail . CITY PRISON The new city prison , modern in every respect , is the pride of law-abiding citizens of Columbus . It occupies a prominent place in the beautiful civic center . Iron bars on the windows are arranged in artistic designs . No disgusting street scenes are allowed to mar its classical serenity . The Black Maria enters through a subterranean passageway . I am whisked by elevator to the clerk 's office on one of the upper floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resisting an officer " have been filed against me . After being searched , I am led through several iron doors to the " bull pen . " This is an enclosure surrounded by cells . There are fifteen or twenty men here , mostly drunks picked up during the night . The place reeks with disinfectant , vomit and bedbugs . I feel weak and nauseated . There is no place to sit except the floor , dirty with tobacco spit . After several hours the dinner call sounds . The men file out . I remain , being too ill to eat . The prisoners return from lunch . We are placed in cells . A cell consists of a tiny compartment crowded with toilet , lavatory and built-in sheet-iron bed . On the bed is a mattress and blanket . It is fairly clean . I lie down to rest . Supper is called . I do not go . About seven o'clock the iron doors of my cell move . They are opened by remote control . " All out for a bath , " yells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bath , " I say meekly . " Goddam you , you 're in jail now . You got to take a bath , " he roars . I rise and stare him in the eye . " Who are you talking to like that ? " He pulls back as though to strike , then , thinking better of it , he leaves the cell . In a minute he returns . " Get off that bunk , " he orders . He takes the mattress and blanket . " Now god-dam you , do n't ask for anything tonight because you wo n't get it ... and you get nothing to eat until you take a bath . " I lie down on the hard iron cot and try to sleep . By midnight friends succeed in raising enough money to get me released on bail . COURTROOM Jurors are not difficult to find during periods of depression . Members of the petty bourgeoisie clamor for the jobs . Strange , the number of landlords and real-estate men on the panel . " Have you ever belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " questions Prosecutor Wayne Fogle . He has no objection to the first twelve jurors . The attorney for the defense , Harry Dworkin , uses his four allotted challenges . He is notified by a spectator that one of the lady jurors was overheard violently denouncing the activities of the unemployed . Dworkin calls the judge 's attention to the lady 's bias . She is called to explain . She denies the allegations . " I will call people who heard the remarks , " offers Dworkin . " Do n't bother . I 'll believe this lady before I will them , " says the judge . The trial starts . A score of policemen testify . They are on the defensive . Mayor Worley has received scores of letters and telegrams protesting the wanton brutality of the police and the gross ineptitude of the relief officials . To vindicate their actions the cops swear to obvious falsehoods : " He tried to take my blackjack . . . " " He kicked me in the groin with both heels . . . . " Witnesses for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea to the jury : " The defendant has committed no illegal act . He was within his constitutional rights in calling upon the multitude to protest peacefully a gross miscarriage of justice . . . . If anyone has erred , it is society itself for permitting such inhuman conditions to exist . " The prosecution pleads : " Every game has its rules . Civilization is a game and the laws which have evolved through the ages its rules .. Even the animals of the jungle have laws , and offenders meet natural punishment . How much more important that human beings uphold their laws and punish those who break them or agitate against them .... Society can not permit organized groups of unemployed to defy court orders . . . , Civilization hangs in the balance . " After half an hour of deliberation , the jury of small property owners saves civilization . I am found guilty and sentenced to the workhouse . WORKHOUSE Arriving at the workhouse , I am questioned regarding my life history . My fingerprints are recorded . My clothing is taken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A frayed blanket and pallet of straw complete my equipment . I am placed in the " idle room , " a dormitory reserved for those with short sentences and for those who refuse to work . There are twenty-two men in the room . They are busy routing bedbugs . They are such a group as might be selected at random from any crowd of American workers . Some are in for petty larceny , for drunkenness and fighting . Most , however , are in for " non-support . " Time hangs heavy for most of us . Talk turns invariably to sex . No subject is too delicate for examination . We wallow in obscenity . It is the easiest way of sublimating pent-up sex emotions . We are permitted to attend chapel and " school . " In chapel ( the only place in the workhouse where jim-crowism is practised ) sanctimonious individuals exhort us to repent our sins and be saved . In school we are taught the wisdom of conforming to existing society . Days come and go , ever the same .
