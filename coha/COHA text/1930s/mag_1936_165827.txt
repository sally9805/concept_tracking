With quaking Spanish Communists last week able to see from the housetops of Madrid the approaching armies of the Whites ( see above ) , Joseph Stalin had not yet done anything to aid the Communist cause in Spain . Direct Madrid-Moscow radio communication had just been opened and the Central Executive Committee of the Spanish Communist Party flashed urgent appeals to the Dictator . Stalin 's whereabouts have been secret since he was reported to have left Moscow " on vacation " with his entourage in an armored train , reputedly to suppress insurgence in his native Georgia . Last week , wherever Stalin was , the Spanish Communists soon got a radio reply signed by Stalin as Secretary General of the Russian Communist Party telling them that " The toilers of the Soviet Union are only carrying out a duty in rendering all the assistance in their power to the revolutionary masses of Spain . " <P> This message could hardly mean anything less than that Soviet bombers and troop ships were about to start for Spain . In alarm the Great Powers peppered their diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Foreign Office on the diplomats ' heels they were received by an official who said that he personally wished with all his heart that Soviet bombers were roaring toward Madrid . " Unhappily it is not so , " shrugged this Bolshevik spokesman , " the Soviet has given its word that it will not intervene in Spain and the Soviet has always lived up to its word . " <P> Meanwhile in London , sputtering Soviet Counsellor Samuel Cahan and silk-hatted Soviet Ambassador Ivan Maisky were blustering at Lord Plymouth in the Foreign Office " demands " : 1 ) that the International Committee on Non-intervention in Spain be again convened and 2 ) that Britain and France " blockade " Portugal to prevent that country-which does not recognize the Soviet Union-from transshipping arms to the Spanish Whites . The exceedingly blue-blooded and frosty Earl of Plymouth , an Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs , placed the tips of his white fingers together and murmured absolute refusal . <P> Meanwhile at Odessa , several thousand of Stalin 's most industriously toiling " Stakhanovite " workers ( TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday at the waterfront while the Soviet steamer Kuban was loaded with clothes and food for Spanish Reds . Several Soviet steamers are now plying back &; forth with this exceedingly tame assistance to Spaniards engaged in a death struggle for Communism in their country . At Barcelona last week the Soviet steamer Zirayanin landed 3,000 tons of foodstuffs amid a local celebration by the city 's dominant Anarchists , Communists and Syndicalists . <P> Owing to a misunderstanding , foreign correspondents in Barcelona spent some time at Communist and Syndicalist headquarters looking for dumpy , old-time U. S. Rabble-Rouser Emma Goldman who is now a British subject and who , as they should have known , was at Anarchist headquarters . " I have come to Spain as to my own , " cried Anarchist Emma to 10,000 Barcelona Anarchists . " Your ideal has been my ideal for more than 45 years . You are giving a shining example to the workers of the rest of the world ! "                    @
