Early one morning last week in the gashouse district on Manhattan 's lower East Side , a neat , grey-haired watchman named George Preston , 47 , was caught setting fire to a rubbish heap under the stairs of a tenement house whose occupants lay sleeping . Watchman Preston , once a probationary fireman at Lynn , Mass. , tearfully told police he took a few drinks every time he got a headache , set fires for excitement every time he took a few drinks . When he accompanied them to The Bronx , pointed out nine buildings he had previously fired , police believed they had cleared up a series of incendiary fires that have terrorized Bronx dwellers for two years . Firebug Preston carefully guided them , past locations where incendiary fires resulted fatally , pointed only to addresses where no lives were lost . Said the police : " These incendiary fires have caused us more worry than any five murderers . "
