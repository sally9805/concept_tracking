On the main line from Cheyenne to Denver , where the cow-country meets the mountains , lies the brisk Colorado city of Greeley . Into Greeley with a flivver-pulled trailer in the fall of 1930 steamed one Elzy Alumbaugh ( " Buzz " ) Hoover , 28 , husky , square-cut , leather-lunged , with a diploma from Fred Reppart 's School of Auctioneering , a wife , two children and $10 . He found a place to park in Greeley 's junky fringe , pushed his gallon hat back off his forehead , and got down to business . <P> Last week this same Buzz Hoover was packing to pull out of Greeley on a streamliner for a vacation , after the busiest season his Greeley Cash Auction Market has ever had . Sales were running some 60% better than 1938 's $1,000,000-plus , and on sales Buzz Hoover collects anywhere from 3% to 7% . Fall and winter business was piling up so that Buzz had to shut down his own auction school , which had 50 aspirants booked at $100 a head . <P> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cattle , shipped in from ranges in seven neighboring States , to " feeders " who prime the beef over the winter for choosy eastern markets . " Boy , oh boy , oh boy , lookut that pretty li'l heifer , " Buzz urged grizzled buyers in his rough-hewn auction pit , " right offa the juicy meadas . Wottami bid , wottami bid for this pretty li'l heifer ? Who 'll start it 25 , 25 , 25 . . . . " They bid up to $97 a head ; Buzz got $57,000 for the lot ; the folks headed home-men , women and children-tired but tickled after a great day at Showman Buzz Hoover 's combination rodeo , barbecue , songfest and livestock sale . <P> For three years after he hit Greeley , Buzz was an enterprising nobody . Then in 1934 he tied up with Greeley 's KFKA , a radio station in somewhat the same situation . He caught ranchers at breakfast daily in seven States with three-quarters of an hour of weather , livestock &; feed prices , good humor , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Claude Redman , Esther Gibson ) , plenty of come-ons for the Greeley Cash Auction Market . He put his auction pit on the air twice a week , took microphones out on the range for farm sales , saw to it that the folks who turned out were not only entertained but fed ( " Free Barbecue at 12 o'clock . Bring your own cups " ) . He offered to sell anything , from a manure-spreader to a mountainside . <P> Now Buzz Hoover uses 23 of KFKA 's 88 hours a week . He built KFKA a new transmitter , which the now booming station has nearly paid for . In Hoover Park , around his auction arena , he has his own studio , the 300-foot transmitter tower outlined with red neon lights . In the park are cattle pens , a Buzz Hoover lumber yard , garages , stores , tourist cottages . On auction days , when the radio-beckoned crowds turn out in droves , Buzz wears a slick cowboy outfit and so do Claude and Esther . His roustabouts wear natty , filling-station-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between sales . Buzz himself is no mail-order Westerner . Colorado-born , he worked for a spell as a brakeman on Spencer Penrose 's Pike 's Peak cog road . As a prelude to his success story , he tells the curious : " I 'm no relation to the ex-President , the G-Man or the vacuum cleaner . "
