Love on the Dole ( by Ronald Gow &; Walter Greenwood ; Maurice Barber , producer ) was hailed after its London premiere two years ago as a dramatic event of first importance . Last week Manhattan first-nighters were inclined to agree , for once , with their British cousins . <P> Even before it reached the stage , Novelist Greenwood 's bitter description of the miserable living provided by Government bounty had assumed something of the authority of a State paper in Britain . It was referred to by members of Parliament when discussing the plight of the " depressed areas . " Novelist Greenwood , who had written himself off the dole with his book , became a public character . There was national rejoicing when it was announced that his new prosperity would enable him to marry the sweetheart of his threadbare days . This was followed by a general lifting of eyebrows when the marriage failed to come off . <P> A realist , Walter Greenwood gives his poverty-stricken story a fresh angle , distinguishes it from the monotonous , incredible heroics of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Dole are believable is that they spend little time trying to adjust the work to themselves . Barely surviving , they have their lives full trying to adjust themselves to the world . <P> Worse could scarcely befall a family than the woes that beset the Hardcastles of Hanky Park , a suburb of Manchester Father Henry , who steadfastly refuses to " go Bolshy , " prays only for God to give him work . Son Harry wins 22 quid on horse race and gets a girl into trouble . Unable to subsist as a human being on her meagre wages , Sally Hardcastle ( Wendy Hiller ) snatches a few rewarding moment ; out on a Lancashire heath with an agitato named Larry ( Brandon Peters ) . When Larry is killed in an unemployed riot , Salb makes her final adjustment to a pitiless environment by becoming the " housekeeper " of a paunchy bookmaker named Sam Grundy .

In the brief time she has been on the stage , no amount of directing could account for the amazing performance of Wendy Killer . An untrained natural , now only 21 , she was playing in a Manchester stock company when Collaborators Gow &; Greenwood found her . They selected her because she looked good in shorts and had the Lancashire accent necessary for the part of Sally Hardcastle . They got more than they bargained for because it was soon apparent that Wendy Hiller possessed mimic assets rare among seasoned actresses . Like Katharine Cornell , she has the trick of inflecting her voice in several keys . She handles her body with the articulate abandon of Elisabeth Bergner , who looks good in shorts , too . The Hillers , well-to-do Manchester cotton people , were opposed to Wendy 's going on the stage .
