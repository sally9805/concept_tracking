The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold , <P> And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold . . . . <P> James Ramsay MacDonald may not know his Byron but he knows his Bible . To this God-fearing Scot the present obstreperous Assyrian minority in the Kingdom of Irak are precious remnants of early Christian tribes . Hundreds of them were being butchered last week by the Irak soldiers and Kurdish mercenaries of lean , falcon-eyed King Feisal . <P> These tidings so distressed Prime Minister MacDonald in Scotland last week that he broke off his vacation at Lossie-mouth and flew 540 mi. to London , alighting at dawn to hurry to the Foreign Office . After all it was the MacDonald Government which withdrew the British mandate over Irak last year ( TIME , Oct. 17 ) , entertained King Feisal in London during the past June season . When King Feisal was in London fullest royal honors were paid to the " new nationhood " of Irak by Christian King George V who feted his royal Mohammedan guest at Buckingham Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to try to save as many of them as possible . Unfortunately the British Minister to Irak , Sir Francis Humphrys , was on vacation in Norway last week , had to be recalled to London and then despatched post haste to Irak by agitated Scot MacDonald . Meanwhile in Bagdad , King Feisal who as a Mohammedan does not greatly object to the massacre of Assyrians or other Christians , tried to dodge all responsibility by insisting that his health is poor , that he must fly to Switzerland " to complete my cure . " <P> Bagdad newspapers accused the Assyrians of coming down like wolves on Irak troops and starting all the trouble . Their story was that an Assyrian rebel chief named Yaku has been weaving back &; forth across the frontier between Irak and French Syria where he is suspected of obtaining arms .

" <P> In reprisal King Feisal 's commander on the Irak-Syrian frontier , fierce Bekir Sidqui Beg , hired Kurds to reenforce his troops and started a slaughter of all Assyrians he could lay hands on , despite the fact that wolf-raiding Rebel Yaku headed a band of not more than 1,000 Assyrians , whereas the Assyrian minority in Irak numbers 40,000 , mostly peaceful . In a few days of fanatical Mohammedan slaughter 600 Assyrian villagers were put to the sword , according to British investigators .

No Assyrian women have been attacked . "
