Foreign missions and missionaries have come in for much sharp criticism during the past month , in the week-by-week reports of the laymen 's Appraisal Commission which surveyed the field for seven U. S. Protestant churches ( TIME , Oct. 31 ) . Last week came more criticism , in a Manhattan speech by Pearl Sydenstricker Buck , author of The Good Earth and Sons , daughter of missionaries , wife and faculty associate of Professor John Lossing Buck whose non-missionary agricultural college at Nanking University is considered a model of its kind . Said Mrs Buck : " I suppose , next to the Chinese among whom I have lived , there is no group of people whom I know better than I do the missionary . . . . I have heard him criticized in the bitterest terms and I have sometimes agreed with that criticism . I have seen the missionary narrow , uncharitable , unappreciative , ignorant . . . I can never have done with my apologies to the Chinese people that in the name of a gentle Christ we have sent such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what you American Christians were. * . . . I found . . . that most of the missionaries were just like you . . . . You had sent us a fair average . On the whole you felt , however , that the very best ought to stay at home . . . when there was someone whom you rather questioned , if at the same time he seemed earnest and sincere , and consecrated-that miserable word that has been used to cover so many deficiencies and so much sloppy thinking-you rather thought he would do . Preachers who would have bored you beyond endurance you sent cheerfully to the foreign field ; young men and women just out of college who knew nothing and did not even know they knew nothing , you sent to a people centuries old . . . . <P> ' ' How dared you send us so many of these little men and women ? How dared you set them up to stand for your God , for Jesus Christ , before the world ? . . . <P> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all thought , it confuses all issues , it is producing in China a horde of hypocrites . . . . Let us cease our talk for a time and cut off our talkers , and let us try to express our religion in terms of life . . . . <P> " As a Chinese I say to you what many Chinese have said to me : ' Come to us no more in arrogance of spirit . Come to us as brothers and fellowmen . . . . Preach to us no more , but share with us that better and more abundant life which your Christ lives . Give us your best , or nothing . ' " <P> <P> *Mrs . Buck was born in Hillsboro , W. Va .. in 1890 , while her parents were briefly vacationing from China .
