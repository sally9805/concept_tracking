THE MARPLE LEGEND A STORY BY VINCENT SHEEAN rT1HE Misses Lydia and Christabel Mar-1 ple , formerly of Cleveland , Ohio , now dwellers on the banks of the Arno , had a feud against a thin , innocent , and mournful waiter by the name of Gino . It was a feud going back a full twenty years , to the first season the Marple sisters had spent in the Longfellow Anglo-American Pension in Florence just after the War . Lydia and Christabel had been younger then , although an unprejudiced observer in 1919 might not have found great changes in them by 1939 ; their brows were still unwrinkled and their hair only slightly graying , their clothes still trim and at times gay , their manners gentle , positive , polite . When they first arrived in Florence they had intended to pass a few months there for culture 's sweet sake , and the months had lengthened into years almost insensibly , so that they hardly noticed the swift immensity of the time flowing by or the events that tumbled down into the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their boundaries were set by the Longfellow Anglo-American Pension  --  or , as it was correctly and legally labelled , the Pensione Anglo-Americana Longfellow ? and by such points of cultural excursion as were most in favor with the frequenters of the Pension . They went up into the nearby hills for a month in the summer , to Fiesole , to San Martino a Mensola ; nearly every year they had a brief trip to Siena ; once , years before , they had made a big journey to Rome and Naples , had visited all the museums , and had spent a week-end on the scented island of Capri , which they did not like . As Lydia said , it was very pretty , but it made her feel lazy , and she did not like feeling lazy ; besides , there were no masterpieces , no museums , no culture on Capri , or at least no culture that could be easily identified as such . For the greater part of the year they stuck to the Pensione Anglo-Americana and to Florence . Lydia and Christabel were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to see in Florence in a whole lifetime ; that there were no gardens like those of Florence , no walks like those along the Arno and in the Cascine ; no music like the occasional seasons in the Politcama . They were familiar figures in the bookshops and tea-rooms of the town , read all the new books as soon as they went into Tauchnitz or Albatross editions , and often made pleasant and permanent friendships among the English and Americans who came to the Pension and even among those who had apartments in Florence . There was no real reason why this train of life should not continue forever , since it satisfied both Lydia and Christabel . Christabel , who was younger , had experienced the fires of discontent years before , but she had been placidly happy now for a long time . It was externally , not in themselves , that the crumbling and shifting of the world structure made appreciable changes , changes which in time became apparent even to them . A good many of their friends were moving away from Florence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pensions went out of business ; a tea-shop that had been a landmark was no more . Lydia and Christabel noted these evidences of decay with regret , but in their minds the only real drawback to unending life in Florence was Gino . That wicked Gino , Lydia called him , and Christabel echoed her : that wicked Gino . Gino was thin and sad . He had looked just the same twenty years before ? busy , elderly , his yellowish skin a little wrinkled , his large eyes innocent and mournful . He was the only waiter in the Pension Longfellow and everybody who lived there knew him very well . When the house was full he was assisted by one girl or sometimes by two . It had been quite a long while now since he had needed two assistants . He was a good waiter . The Misses Marple had no complaint of him on the professional score . Their grievance was deeper , more complicated , more painful . They had chalked up against Gino , over twenty years , a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had caused the departure of that young Englishman twelve years before ; Gino had been responsible for the failure of the Misses Marple to get an invitation to the Rector 's spring reception one year ; Gino was involved in the base and murky intrigue as a result of which Lady Angela Finkle-Wabbage had failed to recognize them one day in the Pitti Palace . " Walked right past as if she had never seen us before , " Lydia said indignantly to Christabel . " And Gino was speaking to her in the street only yesterday . " Gino was , in short , a scandalmonger . Nothing in the blameless lives of the Misses Marple had ever justified his attentions , as Lydia and Christabel assured each other very often ; and yet the whole calm , busy network of the years was shot through and through with the scarlet thread of Gino 's evil-doing . Sometimes Christabel would blush violently when she felt Gino 's large eyes upon her . She did not dislike the sensation , but actually she felt ashamed of it , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ; it was only that Gino , with his easy , insinuating manner , was capable of misinterpreting everything and passing on his misinterpretations as fact to anybody who would listen to him . If Lydia felt inclined to extravagance and bought the most expensive places at the Politeama instead of the cheap seats to which she and Christabel were accustomed they went to any length to keep Gino from knowing . " You ca n't tell what he 'd make of it , " they said . When Christabel wore a new evening dress , which she did once every second winter , she dreaded the moment when she would have to pass before Gino , and the comment which she felt sure he would be making the moment she was out of earshot . These were the secondary , the supplementary aspects of that persecution to which they had felt themselves subjected for so many years ; the primary difficulties were in their relationship with other people . It began in the first winter , only a week or so after the Misses Marplc had arrived in Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pension one day at lunch  --  an inspection no less thorough for being conducted by means of swift sidewise glances . The newcomer was an English lady with a cool , important manner . Gino was leaning over her , obtaining her views about food , whispering in her ear . As he did so the English lady 's eyes came to rest for a moment on the two sisters , frankly appraising , summarizing , and dismissing them ; and then she looked away . " Did you see that ? " Lydia said under her breath . Christabel nodded . " Gino was telling her something . " " About us , " said Lydia with finality , and her lips closed firmly . She knew what to think of Gino after that ; they would have to be careful of Gino . In the society of the Pensione AngloAmericana Longfellow events were not many , and the vital interest of the day inhabited such exchanges as the boarders had with one another , conversations after lunch , walks along the river , museum discussions . In these amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes very cool . In the latter case , as Lydia and Christabel observed very soon , it was Gino who had caused the coolness ; for Gino was to be seen whispering with all newcomers , and their ensuing behavior , Lydia and Christabel felt , was governed by whether or not they believed what he said . One day Lydia left a letter , a rather important letter , on the table after dinner . It was from their brother Alfred and contained a good many financial details . Gino brought them the letter an hour or so later , but when Lydia looked in the envelope she felt quite positive that the sheets had not been put back right . Just how much English did Gino understand ? This was a point upon which the sisters could never make up their minds . But the unquestionable fact was that a total stranger , a young man from Cincinnati , spoke to them the next day about the virtues and demerits of certain traction stocks in that city , stocks in which the Marple sisters were greatly interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail except Gino , the listener and whisperer and letter-reader ? " My dear , " Lydia said with horror , " I believe that man knows to a penny just what our income is . It 's not decent . " In some ways she would have preferred almost any other form of intrusion upon the secret places of their lives . But the young man twelve years ago ? well , that had been a very bad case indeed , of a different kind . He had been a mild , earnest young man from the north of England , a student of the History of Art , which he proposed to teach in due course to other students at Leeds or Sheffield or Birmingham . He lived at the Pensione Longfellow , and Christabel had once met him at the Pitti Palace and walked home with him . That had been the beginning of a pleasant , really a very pleasant and agreeable friendship . All three had coffee together after lunch and dinner in the tiled courtyard of the Pension ; after a few days they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite as cultured as Christabel  --  a little more apt to get the names of painters mixed up  --  and consequently she took the lesser part in their pleasant , agreeable conversations , but she enjoyed them too . Then , after about ten days of this , the young man began to get funny ? there was no better word for it , Lydia decided , no more exact word : he simply began to get funny . He seemed to want to cut lunch short , to do without coffee , to refrain from talking when met in a museum ; and a few days later he went away without even saying good-by . An odd , stiff little note he left behind for Christabel merely said that he was returning to England . A week or so later one of the dwellers in the Pensione Longfellow made a trip to Rome , and on her return she reported that the young man was to be seen there , studying the History of Art all over again . Lydia and Christabel were well aware that the History of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the young man had intended to spend the whole winter in Florence . They knew that Gino had been up to his tricks again . They recalled how they had seen Gino talking to the young man , now and then , in the halls of the Pension . There was no doubt of it , Gino had told something , said something . And this was as nothing of course to the story Gino made out of it afterward . For some weeks whenever Christabel came into the tiled courtyard and heard people laughing she was sure they were laughing over her interrupted friendship with that young man from the north of England . It was absurd of course . She held her head high . She did not care what they said . But it was too bad , it certainly was too bad , that everything she and Lydia did had to become a matter of public interest through the agency of that sly , innocent Gino . And was it true , Christabel wondered ? was it true that she had been , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth repeating endlessly down the halls of the Pensione Longfellow until time was no more ? It seemed hardly possible that she , little Christabel Marple from Cleveland , who had lived her whole life under sister Lydia 's controlling eye , was interesting enough and romantic enough to cause so much talk in the recesses of a refined Pension in Florence . She remembered Mr. Hogarth , the young Englishman , and , so to speak , averted her eyes from the memory ; it was too painful to imagine now , now that it was all over , that perhaps there had been something in it  --  something which had given Gino reason for his whispering , and filled the meditative stares of the ladies and gentlemen of the Pension with significance . Christabel saw them look at her and look away again , and sometimes they were too friendly and sometimes not friendly enough , and her breast was possessed by a not altogether unpleasant confusion ; but she held her head high . People came and went . Sometimes they stayed a few days , sometimes weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one old lady who had been there when Lydia and Christabel arrived and remained until her death , eight years later . But in the course of time they all went , one way and another , and there was nothing permanent in the Pcnsione Longfellow except the Signora , who ran it , and the Misses Marple and Gino . The Signora was not often seen of late years in the dining room and salons ; she was getting frail , and her granddaughter did most of the work of presiding over the place , so that the Misses Marple and Gino shared the honors of antiquity between them . In spite of the detestation which , Lydia and Christabel felt , must bemutual , their relations with Gino were always outwardly cordial . They simply could not afford to antagonize him , they thought . Considering the harm he did by his myth-making faculty at ordinary times , it was nothing less than terrifying to think of what he might say or do if he really had a grudge against them . So Christabel always smiled at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on the first of each year , and when his son was grown up and got married both of the Misses Marple attended the wedding and made gifts to the happy pair . " Sometimes it makes me feel like a hypocrite , " Lydia said grimly , " but I 'm not going to give Gino any excuse for worse than he 's already done . " Once or twice the sisters had spoken of this resident persecutor to their friends . After the episode of Lady Angela FinkleWabbage  --  that time when she walked straight past them without nodding her head  --  Christabel had spoken to a friend who lived at the Pension . " You 've only been here two years , " she said , " you do n't know what goes on . But I suppose Gino has been telling you things . " " What things ? " the friend asked , interrupting her knitting in amazement . " Does anything go on here ? " " My dear , " Lydia said firmly , " it is n't what goes on , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend he has n't been telling you stories about Chris and me . " " Who ? Are you talking about Gino ? He 's never said a word to me about either of you . And anyhow , what is there to say ? " " Nothing at all , " Christabel said in haste , blushing a bright pink . " There never has been  --  ah anything . It 's sim-ply that he 's such a gossip . You know what I mean . He 's capable of making outrageous stories out of the simplest thing . You know . There was a young man here some years ago  --  well , I need n't tell you . If Gino has n't already told you , he will . " " I never heard of such a thing , " the friend said . " I must have a talk with Gino sometime . He sounds livelier than I 'd ever expected . He never says a word to me except about the weather or when the museums are open or what there is for dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriously . They knew better . The persecution had settled down into a condition of life long before , and it was no longer necessary for either Lydia or Christabel to discuss it . They knew by mere signs of the head or hand what the other was thinking about Gino , and which of the events of the day were to be attributed to his incorrigible chattering . If a new family in the Pension was unduly " pushing " they knew that it was because Gino had aroused their unhealthy interest in the doings of the Marple sisters ; and if a newcomer was unusually cool it was for the same reason . Thus the sisters pursued a semi-public career inside the walls of the Pension , the tiled court , and the immediate neighborhood , creatures of legend within a circumscribed space , and resigned to it in time , since there was nothing to be proved against Gino ( he was too clever for that ) and nothing to be gained by making open complaint of him to the Signora . The Signora was getting old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with things until providence saw fit to alter them . And then , one day , Gino announced his intention of retiring from active life . He had discussed it with the Signora for months or years past and his plans were all complete . On the first of the month he was to be superseded by a new waiter . He was going back to his native village in the hills to live with his wife , who had retired as cook some years before , and his one unmarried daughter . Everybody in the Pension gave him presents , and on his last night of service they drank his health in some old Chianti supplied by the Signora herself . It was observed that the Signora , who was whitehaired and a little stoop-shouldered now , wept whenshe said good-by to him . She told her guests that Gino had been with her for just over thirty years and had never given the slightest trouble in all that time . Lydia Marple 's lips set a little more firmly than usual when she heard this statement . After dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time she and Christabel went upstairs and sat on the balcony that ran along their two rooms . ( Such an advantage , one balcony for the two rooms , Lydia often said . ) " Well , Gino 's gone , that 's one good thing , " Lydia remarked . " We 'll have no more of this chattering in corners , and talc-bearing , and story-telling . It 'll be quite different . " " Yes , " Christabel said vaguely , looking at the lights reflected in the river , " I suppose it will . " It was . Many things began to get different at about the same time . There were fewer guests at the Pension , and they never seemed to display the slightest interest in the Misses Marplc . This was , the two ladies assured each other , a great relief ; but sometimes Christabel wondered if even the must agonizing embarrassments of a few years before might not have been more  --  well , more interesting . These new guests at the Pension were usually people who stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved away from Florence . Quite a few . If the city had been evacuated of half its native population the Misses Marple would scarcely have noticed , but when three or four of the Anglo-American residents known to them moved away they thought the place was well-nigh deserted . The new waiter at the Pension was bad  --  both slovenly and impolite ; he lasted only two weeks . His successor , a very handsome young man who combed his sleek black hair whenever he did not have his arms full of dishes , lasted less than a week . A third one was decrepit and had lost his memory , so that you never knew what you were going to get no matter how loudly you asked for it . After these experiences the Signora decided to give up waiters altogether and depend on her two girls for the dining room . This expedient got the meals on the tables with reasonable spccd and accuracy , but the Misses Marple did not feel that it was quite the same thing . A dining room lost caste , they maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been wars and rumors of wars during the time the Misses Marple had lived at the Pensione Longfellow , but now the military intelligence began to overflow from the front page of the Paris New York Herald into the daily conversation of even the most cultured people in Florence . It was no longer possible to deplore briefly , with small lot-tutting noises made between tongue and teeth , the news that dominated the press . Most of the visitors to the Pensione Longfellow talked of nothing else . This was bad enough , but Miss Lydia , who took care of the money affairs of the two ladies , soon had worse to offer : their declining incomes had declined altogether too far , and there were complications , and their brother Alfred thought they ought to come home at least for a bit until they decided what they wanted to do . He thought that by a certain amount of selling and reinvestment they would be all right , but he did n't want to take all the responsibility for the operation , and Miss Lydia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial acumen , was inclined to agree . She would manage these matters better herself . She and Christabel , without openly discussing it , began to look at the steamship advertisements in the Paris New York Herald . For years , in the springtime , they had talked of going home to Cleveland , but now that the idea was actually presented to them they did not talk of it ; they merely adjusted their minds to it by degrees . Secretly Christabel was glad . She felt a little dulled and saddened by the Florence of these weeks ; something had gone out of the place ; something was lacking now . Lady Angela Finkle-Wabbage played ? without knowing it  --  a great part in thelives of the Marple sisters . She was a rude , red-faced Englishwoman of about fifty who stamped through the museums a dozen times a year and gave an occasional large party at her fiat in one of the old palaces . The Marple sisters had once gone to one of her parties , taken by a resident of the Pensione Longfellow who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them when she met them in the street ; she also-took small annual sums of money from them for the hospital and for the church . Now the news spread through the Anglo-American colony in Florence that Lady Angela Finkle-Wabbage had declared the situation very grave and that she was , in consequence , going home to England to live . It was tantamount to a declaration of war and struck more alarm into many a cultured breast than the whole international press had aroused for months past . " That settles it , " Lydia said . " If Lady Angela is going home it must be that she knows something . You know that she has a nephew in the Foreign Office . Christabel , we may as well make up our minds to it . We must go home too . " It was quite a wrench . They spent some three weeks deciding what to pack , what to give away , what to leave behind . For another whole week they packed ; and then there started a series of last times . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the last visit to the Pitti , the last to the Bargello ; the last walk along the river . One morning Lydia came into Christabel 's room and stood at the window on the balcony as if uncertain how to phrase what she wanted to say . " I 've been thinking , Christabel , " she began , " about  --  well . " Christabel looked at her for a moment and then instinct came to her aid . " I know , Lydia , " she said gently . " It 's Gino . " " Yes , it 's Gino , " Lydia said . " I know he persecuted us for years , and he 's a poor wretched creature who does n't deserve a thought , but  --  but I wondered if we might n't go out to his place there in the hills and see him . To say good-by , sort of . And perhaps to have  --  to have a word with him . At last . We never did speak to him about it for all these years , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word with him now , so he wo n't think he fooled us all that time . " " Yes , I 'd like to go out and see him , " Christabel said . " But do n't you think we can just go and say good-by without having anything  --  anything cut with him ? I mean , after so many years and all . He ca n't help the way he is , you know , dear . " " That 's all right , " Lydia said , strengthened again by her sister 's agreement with the plan . " You 're too good-natured . I think we have a right to a word or two , after all we 've been through for twenty years from that man . We 're entitled to speak up , Chris , and I intend to do it . It 's a nice day and we 'll enjoy going out there anyhow . I must get exact directions from the Signora about how to get there . I think you take the Fiesole tram . " The Marple legend had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to journey out to his village now the two sisters began to realize it . Christabel felt the legend resurgent around her in the Signora 's surprise ; it was an unexpectedly delicious feeling ; she was going to be " talked about " again . Even Lydia realized , with something of a shock , that the morning 's excursion touched her pulses to excitement . She attributed it resolutely to the weather . " It 's such a lovely day , " she said , " that it would n't matter where we were going . It 's nice just to be going . " They had an hour on the familiar tram before they came to a stop below the hill of Fiesole and got out to explore for Gino 's house . It was off on a path to the right , near a very small village where Gino had been born . There were vineyards and orchards everywhere ; the sun was brilliantly warm ; the valley of the Arno lay exquisite beneath them . Christabel 's mood was soft and happy . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " It 's such a nice day . And we 've had a nice time here in Florence , all these years . Let 's just say good-by to him . " " Quarrel ? " Lydia said , gasping a little from the scramble over an uneven mounting path . " I wo n't quarrel with Gino . But I do mean to say a few plain words to him before we leave . He ca n't go on thinking we did n't notice what he was doing all this time . It 's a question of pride . We put up with it for twenty years , but he must at least realize that we knew what he was doing . " They came abruptly on the house , a Tuscan farmhouse of the more prosperous kind with walled gardens and an incomparable view . The hillside fell away before it in terraces and winding paths and blossoming orchards to the valley far below . There was a huge fig tree before the house , with a table built on to its trunk , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely idle for the first time in the Misses Marple 's acquaintance with him . He had a pipe in his hand but was not even smoking as they came near . He was gazing out into the luminous valley below , and his large , mournful eyes were unwinking . Lydia had to say his name aloud before he became aware of their approach . " Ah , Signorina , Signorina ! " he exclaimed , jumping to his feet with hands outstretched . " Signorina , what an honor you do me ! What pleasure to sec you ! I am overcome . " And he did seem , as a matter of fact , to be overcome . He was babbling and gesticulating for several minutes , bowing , jumping about , pushing the two wooden chairs forward for them , asking questions and exclaiming all at once . His usual compliments on their beauty  --  a part of his conversational style at the Pensione Longfellow for many years  --  came tumbling out with more than the usual warmth . Both Lydia and Christabel were startled to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was genuinely glad to see them and that they , moreover , were glad to see him . He left them alone for a moment while he went inside to get his wife . " Lovely place , " Christabel said . " And I think he is glad to see us . I do n't think he can help being a gossip . " " You 're softhearted , Chris , " her sister said . " And maybe a little soft-headed too . We ca n't let the fellow win everything without a word being said . " Gino returned with his wife , a plump , florid woman whose twinkling blue eyes rested first on Miss Lydia and then on Miss Christabel with an expression perilously close to mockery . This was Maria ; she had been cook at the Pensione Longfellow up until five or six years ago ; she had not often seen the guests there or been seen by them , but her awareness of their lives was no doubt complete . Now she wore a white kerchief amply folded over her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks back of the housc to dry in the sun . She did not approve of factory-made spaghetti , she said . She was delighted to see the two Signorine , and what would they " take " ? Would they " take something " ? Taking something , as Lydia and Christabel knew , usually meant a little glass of some very sweet aperitive wine , Malvasia or white port or the like , which neither of them " took " with any pleasure . They agreed politely , and Maria vanished again to get the bottle and glasses . Time passed in the politenesses of the formal visit ; Gino showed them over his house , of which he was very proud , and they looked at the vatted Chianti in the cellar and the spaghetti drying on the rocks in the sun ; he told them about his vineyards and his orchard , and his married son and his unmarried daughter who was out working in the fields . Maria said little , but moved along with them on their tour of inspection , her blue eyes mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . Lydia then saw fit to explain the reason for thisvisit : she and her sister were returning to America , probably to stay there . More explosions , gestures , exclamations : Gino could hardly believe that such a thing was possible . " The Pensione Longfellow will never be the same again , " he said . " It is n't anyhow , " said Lydia briskly . " None of the regulars are left now . Only people who come and go . I think it 's changed altogether since you left , Gino . " " The Signorina is too kind ! The Signorina exaggerates ! " " No , it 's a fact . Coincidence , no doubt , but a fact . Just about the time you left things began to seem different . It 's not the same any more and we do n't mind leaving . We 'll be glad to get home . " When the high ceremonies of the visit were over Gino offered to accompany the ladies down the path to the place on the road where the tram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her farewell with a curtsy and returned to her spaghetti . Gino and the two ladies set out on their way , and before they had taken many steps Lydia opened up on him . " Gino , " she said , " before we leave Florence for good I want you to know that we have realized all these years what you were up to , with your malicious , wagging tongue . We came out here really to tell you that we know all about it and that we forgive you . " " Forgive me ? Per Dio ! What is this about my wagging tongue ? Signorina , Signorina ! " " We knew it all the time , Gino , " Lydia said firmly . " It 's too late now to discuss it . We only want you to know that we forgive you . " Gino was sorely puzzled . He would have stopped in the path and leaned on the low stone wall to think this over , except that the ladies kept resolutely on their way and he had to accompany them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know what you are talking about . I am glad to get your forgiveness but do not know what it is for . For twenty years I have served you as well as I knew how . If you had any complaints you could always have made them at the time . " " There was never anything wrong with your service as a waiter , " Lydia said tartly , She was annoyed to find her forgiveness thrown back at her like this . " It 's your gossiping , your story-telling . Oh , do n't think we do n't know how you chattered about us to everybody who came to the Pension ! We ignored it , but we knew it was going on . " " Chattering ? Story-telling ? Madonna mid ! " Gino was overwhelmed ; he called on the blue sky , the sunny valley , the blossoming orchards to witness ; his hands invoked the visible world . " Never , never , never , Signorina ! Not once in twenty years was I guilty of such a thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Was there ever anything that would make a story no matter how it was repeated ? And I , I , I , who never said a word about anybody from one year 's end to the next ? 1 Signorina ! " Christabel seemed a little agitated . " There were some things to tell , " she said . " And we do know you told them . There was no other explanation . You remember Mr. Hogarth , the young Englishman . " " What young Englishman ? Madness ! Folly ! Signorina , what young Englishman ? " " Mr. Hogarth , who went away after you 'd been talking to him about us . " " I do n't remember any such young Englishman , Signorina . There were so many who came and went . I was there so many years . But I swear to you that I never said a word to any young Englishman . Until this moment I never knew there was one  --  that is , one who had the honor of pretending to the Signorina 's favors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gino ! How dare you suggest such a thing ? The young man was a mere acquaintance , a very pleasant acquaintance , and that 's all . It was your malicious gossip-ing tongue that made a story out of it  --  a story which , I may say , we 've not altogether lived down even yet . Do n't think we do n't notice how people look at us after they 've been a few days in the Pension . " " Ah , Signorina , believe me , this is all false . I do n't know who told you to believe such things . In my life in the Pension I saw many things and always kept my mouth shut about all of them . I did not like them any the more but I kept still . I used to say to Maria , always ; Now these two Signorine Marple , they arc really pious ladies , they might be nuns . They are so well-behaved and so discreet and virtuous , nothing ever happens to them , they are models for spinster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never would I have dreamed of repeating anything that had to do with the two Signorine Marple . Even if there had been anything  --  which I never knew or thought until this moment . " Christabel was blushing a very deep pink in her confusion . " Let 's leave it at that , Lydia , " she said pleadingly . " I do n't think we can argue about it . Let it go , let it go . Please . " Lydia was struggling with her temper . " I forgive you , Gino , " she said loudly . " Remember that . The tram is coming now and we wo n't meet again , but we both forgive you . Just remember that we . . . " The tram came along and she hoisted herself into it without completing the sentence . Christabel , still pink with embarrassment , got on after her and said : " Good-by , Gino . " The ex-waiter stood in the dusty road and looked up at them , his large dark eyes mournful and puzzled . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it started off again , clanging down the hillside to Florence . Christabel was trembling as if she had caught a chill . " Oh , Lyddy , Lyddy , " she said , " what if that was true ? What if he did n't ever , really , say anything , and nobody thought anything , and nothing ever happened at all , all this time ? " Her voice broke and she put her handkerchief to her eyes . Lydia extended one arm across Christabel 's neat blue-clad shoulders . " Do n't believe him , dear , " she said fiercely . " He 's a wily one , and he always has been . Why , just remember the things that have happened ! We know he 's been scandal-mongering year in and year out . I dare say his stories will follow us even to America .
