Into a pair of oversized Kentucky shoes , worn only twice before , a Yankee journalist stepped last week . New York-born , 42-year-old Herbert Agar , onetime diplomat , novelist , playwright , poet , critic , historian , became editor-in-chief of the Louisville Courier-Journal . <P> First editor of the Courier-Journal was Colonel Henry Watterson ( " Marse Henry " ) who helped to found it by a merger in 1868 . A bellicose , one-eyed , ex-Confederate cavalry scout with walrus mustaches , Colonel Watterson knew 13 U. S. Presidents , thoroughly approved of only one : Abraham Lincoln . He took keen pleasure in abusing each of the others in turn , whether Democrat or Republican . <P> In the Courier-Journal Colonel Watterson said flatly that Theodore was " as mad as a March hare , " suggested that his family ought to lock him up before he did more harm . Another time he called Roosevelt " as sweet a gentleman as ever scuttled a ship or cut a throat . " When World War I began , Marse Henry wrote : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it was his habit to end his editorials with the cry : " To hell with the Hohenzollerns and the Hapsburgs ! " <P> At first a supporter of Woodrow Wilson , he grew scornful of the President 's caution , eventually warned his readers : " Beneath the veneering of scholarly polish lies the coiled serpent of unscrupulous ambition . " After rich Judge Robert Worth Bingham bought the paper in 1918 and supported the League of Nations ( " . . . inevitably Woodrow Wilson would be caught by such a whimsy . . . " ) Marse Henry quit in disgust . He died a few years later . <P> Judge Bingham , nominal editor of the Courier-Journal for ten years , doubled its circulation , upheld the national reputation that Colonel Watterson had given it . But he left the editorial page to Harrison Robertson , and in 1929 resigned the title to him . ( Judge Bingham became Franklin Roosevelt 's Ambassador to Great Britain , died in office two years ago . ) Editor Robertson never worked for any other paper . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he died last fortnight . <P> Author Agar , who succeeds him , studied arts at Columbia , philosophy at Princeton , spent four years in Britain , where he was literary editor of the English Review , London correspondent for the Courier-Journal . After he won a Pulitzer Prize in 1934 for his book The People 's Choice ( thesis : most U. S. Presidents were " a feeble and meritless tribe " ) he went home , joined the Courier-Journal staff . <P> Once a conservative who believed that democracy had been a dismal failure , Editor Agar swung leftward with Roosevelt . His recent books are pious , eloquent , Democratic ; his syndicated column , Time and Tide , has a resolutely New Deal aura . He takes his seat in Marse Henry 's vacant office next January , at the close of a current lecture tour .
