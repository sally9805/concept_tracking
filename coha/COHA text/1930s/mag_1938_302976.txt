No nation had the World by the tail this week , but the rear end of the British lion was within measurable distance of Adolf Hitler 's grasp as he spent three hours addressing the German Reichstag . <P> Well knowing the British Cabinet was splitting over Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden 's insistence upon policies which please France and Russia but anger Germany and Italy ( see p. 22 ) , Orator Hitler attacked the young English statesman by name , then coupled Eden with the name of a Dictator . <P> " Soviet Russia is the only state with which Germany has no desire to cooperate , " declared the Chancellor , " for Soviet Russia is trying to Bolshevize the world . If England was really anxious to defend the status quo , she would energetically oppose the Bolshevization of other countries , for such Bolshevized regions are no longer self-governing states but only sections of the revolutionary Moscow centre . I know Mr. Eden does not share this view ! Stalin does and openly admits it . " ( See p. 17 . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , devoted a conciliatory part of his speech to announcing that : 1 ) Germany extends diplomatic recognition to the Empire of Manchukuo and assures Japan that the Fatherland wants no territory in Eastern Asia ; 2 ) Germany has no territorial designs upon France or Spain and is " proud " of the 1934 pact by which Germany and Poland continue to respect each other 's rights and interests , " even in Danzig " ; 3 ) as to Austria : <P> ' ' I want at this point to express sincere thanks to the Austrian Chancellor for his deep understanding and warmhearted readiness wherewith he accepted my invitation and endeavored with me to find a way that is quite as much in the interests of the two countries as it is in the interests of the entire German people whose sons we all are no matter where our cradles stood . I believe we thereby made a contribution to European peace . " ( See p. 19 . ) " Self-Determination . " Touchiest subject that Adolf Hitler raised was his pronouncement on the favorite Nazi doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordering Germany alone include a mass of 10,000,000 Germans ! Austria &; Czechoslovakia-see map . . . . About one thing there should be no doubt . Separation from the state sovereignty of the Reich can not lead to the loss of racial or political rights ' . . . Just as England defends her interests the world over , the present day Germany will be able to defend her much more limited interests . " " Colonies Demanded . " But the big smash of the Chancellor 's speech was Hitler 's ominous roar that Germany has " no differences with England-except colonies ! " <P> If the British Empire were destroyed , the Fhrer went on pointedly to say , the United Kingdom would soon enough thirst for overseas territory as Germany thirsts today . The English did not secure their colonies by holding democratic plebiscites among the natives , continued the Chancellor , " but through naked , brutal force ! "
