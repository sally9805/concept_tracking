txt For the second time since before der valuation of the franc last September . the Bank of France yesterday resorted to an increase in its bank rate  --  to 6% from 4% ? in an attempt to protect franc exchange against the combined pressure of an adverse balance of trade and a. flight of capital . The previous similar occasion came early , this year , when the rate was raised to 4% from 2% . But this time , it is understood , consideration was actually given to increasing the rate to 8% , which would have been an unheard-of change . Usually central bank rates move by ; half-points . This protective move afforded no relief yesterday , however , and demand for sterling exchange increased in Paris . In addition , the popular impression within the country that the situation may be grave was intensified ; a run on sterling bank notes is developing . Makes Crisis More Acute As a matter of fact , the rise in the bank rate deepens the crisis in two respects . The fact that the Popular Front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main reasons for the franc 's weakness , but a higher money rate would seem to preclude obtaining the needed funds by normal financing methods , that is in the money market . Furthermore , the outlook for the Bourse also is clouded as money for the periodic settlement will be dear , and weak securities prices can hardly aid sentiment . Attention of all Paris will be focussed today , upon the Council of Ministers , presided over by President LeBrun , which meets at nine o'clock to receive the text of Finance Minister Vincent Auriol 's financial proposals , which received unanimous approval of the Cabinet yesterday , afternoon . That the measures will be drastic there is no doubt . Suspicion that the government may , be meditating compelling the banks or the public to lend money to the State has been strengthened by speeches by Paul Faure . Socialist Minister without Portfolio , and the labor leader Jouhaux . The Tri-Partite Pact With pressure on the franc unabated , a hint was given yesterday that the French govern- ment may not be perfectly satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government has repeatedly stated that the pact would continue to be the key note of the government 's financial policy , the Radical Minister of Commerce Bastid claimed that although reduction of trade barriers was one of the main points of the currency pact , neither Great Britain nor the United States have made any move to second French action taken after devaluation for lower tariff and warned of growing protectionist movement in France . Speeches made by both Faure and Jouhaux are revealing as showing the extent to which the radical forces are willing to go in matter of credit control and nationalization of industry . Faure declared that if the Radical Socialists as well as the Communists remain loyal to the government , " we Socialists are decided , in the face of financial difficulties which can become very acute , to demand from Parliament the means for breaking the circle of iron which the capitalist forces are drawing around us " . Alluding to the export of capital and even of industrial plants , he urged the necessity for rapid procedure to terminate this treason . Views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francs lie not in homes but in the vaults of banks " which organize international speculation and evasion of capital " , again declared that if nationalization of credit is not yet practical , control of credit is necessary . He added that to enable the country to live in freedom , the coal mines , steel , chemical and transport industries must be nationalized . These declarations reflect the realization that the Blum experiment is well nigh blocked by the financial deadlock . Radical Minister of Commerce Bastid , speaking yesterday at the International Exchange Congress , revealed the realization that there is a price deadlock as well . He pointed out that the lowering of tariffs and removal of import quotas by France after devaluation of the franc last September had remained without echo abroad and that an increase in the import surplus had produced a protectionist movement in the Chamber of Deputies . He added that other signatories to the tripartite agreement must take note of this spirit since their active collaboration is necessary unless France is to adopt autarchy which might prove less difficult than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolitan and colonial production . A Deliberate darning This amounts to a deliberate warning that the French government can not resist the protectionist movement unless England and America take action . Accompanying the increase in the bank rate yesterday , were the-regutar increases in other money rates by the Bank of France . Its loaning rate was increased to 7% while the rate on advances on 30 day bills was raised to 6% from 4% . An 8% bank rate is not out of the question , although the Council was satisfied yesterday with 6% . A further increase may be decided upon should the exchange position show no improvement . There are no signs of this Improvement yet . either in the foreign exchange position or on the Bourse . The Bourse yesterday was irregular and dull . In the exchanges , pressure on the franc developed from all quarters . Premiums on forward sterling for one month remained over two francs , while premium for three months rose to 4.85 francs , and even touched 5 francs .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
