For six years Cleveland , the first big U. S. city to try to lift its government above ward politics , has had a City Manager . Three times in the past three years Cleveland has voted to keep City Management . The last vote was in August ( TIME , Sept. 2 ) . On that occasion City Manager William Rowland Hopkins breathed a happy sigh , looked out into the night , and declaimed : " The future of Cleveland now seems to lie as straight and clear as yonder moonbeams . " Had he been a sterner , less rhapsodical prophet , he would have chosen another simile , for last week , less constant than the moon , the City Council voted him out of the office he had held and defended for six years . <P> To watch the proceedings , 10,000 shouting citizens tried to cram themselves into the large oak-paneled council room in Cleveland 's City Hall . Those who could get in heard the clerk droning a resolution praising the Hopkins administration , asking its continuance . They saw round-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great show of indifference the 61 amber bulbs in the Moorish chandelier . They saw 25 councilmen , impatient at the droning , presided over by Mayor John D. Marshall , fingering his gavel , munching peanuts. * <P> The clerk stopped droning . A little councilman named Walz hopped to his feet , demanded Mr. Hopkins ' immediate dismissal . He offered no formal charges . A few letters , mostly favoring Mr. Hopkins , were read . The clerk droned a formula . The vote : for dismissal , 14 ; against , 11 . <P> The happy sigh , the moonbeam future passed by this vote to Maurice Maschke , Ohio 's National Republican Committeeman , Cleveland 's cigar-smoking , bridge-playing boss . He himself had put Mr. Hopkins into office , only to become displeased with him , plot his removal . It was not until just before last week 's meeting that he was able , after three unsuccessful party caucuses , to assemble another in Room 1050 at the Hollenden Hotel , three blocks from City Hall , to line up the 13 council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed Mr. Hopkins , the Maschke councilmen chose State Senator Daniel E. Morgan . <P> Mr. Hopkins charged up his ousting to Boss Maschke 's dislike of his policy on municipal appointments and salaries , and to East Ohio Gas Co. ' s dislike of his fight for lower rates . Others , less guarded , said the Maschke machine , weakened by charges of corruption , needed more spoils to stave off dissolution . <P> Mourned Mr. Hopkins : " . . . The men who voted to bring me here , the men who know me to be honest , who know the record of these six years is without stain . . . I did expect that they would treat me at least as well as a common prisoner . " He demanded specific charges , and an opportunity to answer them . <P> The council drafted formal charges . They were vague . Mr. Hopkins had once said that he was a Republican before a certain antagonist had left Hungary . This was called " unAmerican " of Mr. Hopkins . Also it was charged he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councilmen to the penitentiary . Furthermore , he was dictatorial , unharmonious . Where the charges came from , councilmen said they did not know . A messenger had brought them from outside . Alert newsmen noted that the messenger was a Maschke minion , had left the Maschke office with a packet just before his arrival at City Hall .
