Among the numerous Jewish political groups of Palestine is an extreme rightist organization called the New Zionist Organization , also known as the Jewish Fascists . This young men 's society , a terrorist group in its original Polish homeland , believes in the Old Testament eye- &-tooth; principle when dealing with both British and Arabs . The New Zionists ' politics are repugnant to both the British Passport Office and the Zionist-operated Central Palestine Bureau . So visa applications to Palestine are invariably combed to eliminate the Jewish Fascists . A few have nevertheless slipped through . <P> Month ago an Arab bus in northern Palestine was fired on . In a nearby shed , British officers found three young Jewish Fascists , loaded with bombs , revolvers and rifles . British emergency regulations , prescribing the gallows for possession of arms , have been applied against Arab terrorists . Last week a British military court showed it could be equally stern with Jewish terrorists . The court condemned two of the young Jews to hang , sent the third to an insane asylum . Sole hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander of the British Palestine forces , who must confirm the sentences . If confirmed , the two convicts will be the first Jews to be hanged in Palestine since British occupation .
