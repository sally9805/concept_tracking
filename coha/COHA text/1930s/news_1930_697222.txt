txt Faced with open hostility to the terms of the naval pact signed at London between the United States , Great Britain and Japan , Secretary Adams defended the treaty today before the Senate Naval Affairs Committee . " The treaty is an advantage to the United States , " the Secretary told the committee , whose chairman , Senator Hale of Maine , did most of the questioning . With that ' thesis he sat down to a four-hour defense of concessions in cruiser strength which he freely stated had been made to Japan , the adoption of a building program that will cost about $1,000,000,000 over a term of ten years , and the yielding of other points to Great Britain . The Secretary also told the committee that " It probably would not be a good policy to build all of the ships allowed under this treaty . " Parity with Great Britain has been really achieved through this treaty , he maintained , and he praised it as fair in regard to Japan , saying : " I signed the treaty because I believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other nations . " Admitting that there is a " disparity of opinion , " Secretary Adams stated : " I have no doubt that the treaty gives parity with Great Britain in every category . " Compromised to Save Treaty . One of the most serious ' Objections raised by Senator Hale involved the cutting down of the twenty-one flinch gun cruisers at the instance of the Japanese to eighteen , with building conditions outlined which forbid the commissioning of more than fiftan of them before 1936 , the end of the life of the pact . " Did England have anything to do with that ? " asked Senator Hale . " It was purely a Japanese plan , " replied Secretary Adams . " That was part of the compromise . " " We went as far as we could go in trying to get twenty-one 8-inch gun cruisers without breaking off negotiations , " he stated at another point . " Great Britain and Japan were opposed to us . " Allegations that the Japanese had been elevated from their position in the 5-5-3 arrangement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially admitted by the Secretary of the Navy . Throughout the morning session of the hearing , Senator Walsh of Massachusetts demanded to know the cost to the United States of achieving parity , and asked if the " naval reduction " means a saving or an increase in an effort to achieve parity . Secretary Adams placed the cost of achieving parity under the treaty at about $1,000,000,000 , saying that there are plans byr ' which this may be done within the life of the treaty , or over a ten-year period . Senator Hale immediately stated that the United States had done virtually no building in ten years . Few Spectators Present . The Naval Committee met in an Old room of the Capitol , the walls of which were adorned only with a flag and a portrait of President Harding , in whose administration the Washington treaty was drawn up in 1922 . Less than twenty spectators , aside from newspaper men , were present . Only when it was called to order was the last doubt that the hearing might be postponed dispelled . It previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propriety of the Naval Committee 's holding hearings on a treaty has been made at the Capitol . Apparently taking cognizance of this sentiment , Senator Hale opened the hearing by reading a statement in which , he pointed out that last July he had said that " any changes in the fifteen-cruiser program as authorized by Congress would involve full hearings by the Committee on Naval Affairs of the Senate . " " The effect of the London treaty is materially to change this program , " he added . " The purpose of these hearings , " he continued , " Is to bring out for the use of the Senate and for the information of the country as exhaustive information as it is possible to get as to the effect of the London treaty on the national defense of the country . " Hale Sees Need for Publicity . He prophesied undoubted ratification of the treaty by the Senate , " if radical changes in naval policy " involved in the treaty " can be defended , and proof be given that it is to the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of the terms of the treaty . " " If the treaty , as it now stands , " he continued , " will hold water in every respect , there can be no possible objection to_the throwing the full light of publicity upon it . If it will not hold water , it is in the highest degree . essential that its defects should be known and understood . " I believe that this committee will approach the whole matter from a fair standpoint . I think that very few members of the Senate have as yet the naval knowledge necessary to act intelligently upon the treaty . If we can in some manner help to furnish that knowledge to the Senate our time wilr-not have been wasted . " Certain confidential matters of a military nature.will have to be taken up in executive session . In such cases the press and the public will understand why they will have to be excluded from the hearings . " Japan 's Fleet " More Modern . " Secretary Adams began his testimony by reading a prepared statement in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her fleet is more modern than ours . " The financial aspect of the treaty was brought to the front immediately by Senator Walsh , who asked : ? " Is n't the whole question whether or not the navy needs more appropriations to carry out the treaty pro-gram ? " Before Secretary Adams could answer , Senator Hale said : " We 'll bring all that up later , " inage 1 , Column 6. dicating that the examination of Secretary Adams might be continued for some time . Taking up the articles of the treaty in order , Senator Hale asked if Japan had not been favored in the scrapping of battleships , pointing out that she loses only one to four for Great Britain and two for the United States . Secretary Adams testified , that this was purely a matter of proportion . It was Article 18 , however , which caused the most contention . It is this paragraph which grants the United States eighteen 8-inch-gun cruisers , but stipulates that only fifteen may be laid down in the near future . The sixteenth would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed until 1936 , the end of the life of the treaty , with the other two following later . Adams Defends Compromise . At that point , under questioning by Senator Hale , Secretary Adams said that this was part of the compromise necessary to win Japanese approval of the treaty . It was in this connection also that Secretary Adams suggested that it might be well not to lay down all the cruisers at this time . Pointing out that most of our fleet had been built during the war , especially the destroyers , he said that soon there would be the possibility of the navy having an obsolete fleet . Thus , he said , it would be well to have unused tonnage in reserve , as well as to make it possible to incorporate future improvements in design in some of the proposed vessels . " Do n't you think , " Senator Walsh asked , " that it is disappointing to the people of the United States that a conference to reduce naval armaments should cost a billion dollars ? " " But remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Hale interrupted . The value of the fleet is about $2,000,000,000 , he said , with the life of naval craft averaging about twenty years , and added : " The American people should realize that it costs $100,000,000 a year to keep it going . " Navy Board Ignored Hale Hints . Charges that the naval delegation might not have followed the recommendations of the naval board were made by Senator Hale , with the indication that he would go into them thoroughly later . Through a long series of questions // CONCESSIONS BY US DEFENDED BY ADAMS // he inquired about the methods of making decisions , which Secretary Adams said frequently originated in private conferences and , later were discussed in open sessions . Senator Shortridge of California asked that the records of these discussions , where records were kept , be made public . " Great Britain has retained everything offered her last Summer , " Senator Hale continued . " All of the concessions have been made on our side . Their fleet is based on their needs , but ours is not based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America had sacrificed the protection of her trade routes in time of war through permitting the number of eight-inch gun cruisers to be cut . " We got only combat parity , " he added . To this the witness replied that the possible need of protecting trade routes is a matter for future speculation . Cruisers figured prominently in another phase of the hearing when Article 21 , known as the " escalator article , " came up for discussion . This provides that any of the three contracting parties , when endangered by an outside power , may build over its quota , providing it notifies the other parties to the treaty of its intention . They , in turn . then may build up to parity with the first . Britain Insisted . Says Adams . " Great Britain particularly insisted on that clause , did n't she ? " asked Senator Hale . " That is a fair statement , " answered Secretary Adams . . The witness agreed that there was little possibility of the United States wishing to build above its quotas , thus being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain when more cruisers may be deemed necessary . " Whatever we tinued Senator based on what authorities do ? " " It might be plied Secretary Adams . " Therefore , we get very little benefit and probably will be forced to build ships we do n't want ? " " I do n't like the word ' probably , ' " said the Secretary . " We may be forced to . but I do n't think there is any possibility we will . " Senator Hale brought out that this remote eventuality , which would be brought about only through unsettled conditions on the European Continent affecting Great Britain , might have one result important to us , in that if the British build more cruisers the allotment of the United States would automatically be increased . " Would this mean that if Great Britain built more 6-inch-gun cruisers the United States could build an equal tonnage of 8-inch-gun cruisers ? " Senator Hale asked . this country catches up with her in new building . Economy in Battleships Cited . While declining to answer definitely , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether economy would result from the treaty program , Secretary Adams pointed out that ten battleships , which would have cost $400,000,000 if built as permitted by the Washington treaty , will not be laid down . When Senator Hale recalled that France and Italy are permitted to build 70,000 tons of battleships because of " unused tonnage " from the Washington treaty , Secretary Adams pronounced as " remote " the chance that this would affect Great Britain or the United States . Questioned concerning two points in the treaty which permit unlimited building of vessels under 600 tons , raid to be particularly desired by Japan , and the construction of two 5,000-ton minelayers by Japan , the Secretary pronounced the first class of vessels built in b lar " e numbers a waste of money , and testified that the minelayers might have been had by the United States had it so desired . The small ships mentioned are principally tenders and like boats , with their armament strictly limited . The questioning of Secretary Adams will be continued tomorrow . did there , " conHale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re- Additional Building Conceded . " It could if it so wished , " Secretary Adams replied . " Even if the United States had not built up to its full allotment of 6-inchgun cruisers ? " " Yes , " replied the Secretary . It had previously been brought out that there is considerable disagreement over the comparative value of the 10,000-ton cruisers when armed with 8-inch guns and with 6-inch guns . The former have greater firing power , but sacrifice protective armor to the weight of the guns , and are more vulnerable in battle . But they have been said to be more desirable as raiders cruising far afield in wartime . Senator Shortridge , whose questioning was confined principally to the amplification of some points brought put , asked one question which brought a smile to the Secretary 's face . After a long discussion of the many technicalities concerning comparing the strength of individual ? ; boats and classifications , the California Senator asked : " Can you give us the actual fighting strength of the various navies ? " " It is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going over a great mass of statistics ? and indulging in much guesswork . " Armed Merchantmen Discussed . Pointing out that the treaty requires submarines hereafter to warn merchant vessels before sinking them and to see that passengers and crew are removed safely , Senator Hale asked if this meant that a submarine should come to the surface and warn an armed merchantman possibly capable of sinking her . " That question depends on whether a merchant vessel becomes a warship by carrying guns , " he replied . " This particularly is the knowledge of the Secretary of State . " " I understand no agreement was made regarding the arming of mer-chantmen ? " " No , " replied the witness . Returning to the question of Japan 's rise in the ratios of naval strength , Senator Hale searched for the reason , asking : " During any negotiations last Summer , was there any indication that the 5-5-3 Japanese ratio was to be abandoned ? " " I ca n't answer that . It was in the hands of the President , " Secretary Adams replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to London ? " " We had notice from Japan that she might seek more tonnage , " continued the Secretary , saying that the delegation was " open-minded " on the subject . " Can you state when we first considered giving up the 5-5-3 ratio ? " Adams Denies " Trade " With Japan .. " No , " said Secretary Adams , and Immediately denied without qualification that the raising of Japan 's standing had been given as a trade for the signature of the Pacific power to the pact . " In your opinion , " continued Senator Hale , " what ships should we build before 193G ? " " To answer that question , " said Secretary Adams , " would take a long period of study . We have two tentative building programs mapped out . One of them would provide for hurrying through the building , the other would occupy until 1940 , but which one is the best still is in doubt . " Admitting that Japan has superiority in cruisers , that her destroyers , while fewer , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine fleet , Secretary Adams asserted that concessions with her were made on both sides , inasmuch as Japan , in effect , was asked to stand still while
