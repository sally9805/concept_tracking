If it had been possible for me to talk to King Edward VIII for just one hour , the abdication of His Majesty could have been avoided . He had a responsibility not only to Britain but to Europe of which he did not seem to be aware. - Adolf Hitler <P> German intimates of the Realmleader have repeatedly heard him make various versions of the above remark , and last week they were not surprised when Der Fhrer , having welcomed the Duke &; Duchess of Windsor to his Bavarian chteau , drew royal Edward aside and was seen to engage him for 20 minutes in heated conversation . " The tour of our Fatherland which the Duke and Duchess have now completed , " remarked one of the Dictator 's aides , " has shown how right Der Fhrer was in judging that King Edward 's abdication would be a serious blow to German interests . " With ladies Herr Hitler is always the pink of effusive German politeness , took both the Duchess of Windsor 's hands in his own as he warmly said good-by to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Windsor who snapped one back . <P> Slumberous and soporific as the drone of a bumble bee is the atmosphere of German feudalism in which dwells with dignity Der Obergruppenfhrer Herzog von Coburg . The Herzog or Duke of Coburg is the Head of the Family of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha . This was the name of the British Royal Family before it was changed to Windsor in 1917 . Therefore last week European socialites were agog to see what kind of dinner the Duke of Coburg would give in Nrnberg for the Duke &; Duchess of Windsor . Would the greatest ladies of the House of Coburg and of German society be invited to meet the Duchess , and would the Head of the House treat her as having the rank of Royal Highness-a rank King George VI has not yet bestowed on his American sister-in-law . Der Obergruppenfhrer Herzog von Coburg steered a middle course . He gave a dinner of 18 covers . Seventeen of those at the table were men . The 18th place card read " Ihre Koenig-liche Hoheit der Herzogin von Windsor " - Her Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's credit , as he and the Duchess returned to Paris this week before sailing for Manhattan , were 14 dawn-to-dusk days of the most intensive inspection of German industry and housing ( TIME . Oct. 18 ) . Three days of much less strenuous royal inspecting in England last week caused the 43-year-old Duke of Windsor 's 34-year-old brother the Duke of Kent to quit for a few days ' rest with the words " I 'm all in " ( see p. 25 ) .
