txt Following the passage yesterday by the Board of Aldermen of the city 's new $40,000,000 tax program , the Board of Estimate last night , at Samuel Untermyer 's suggestion , voted to reduce the salaries of its own members to the 1929 level , putting the revised figures in the 1934 budget . Mayor O'Brien himself put through the resolution which will cut the salary of his office to $25,000 next year . The reductions in the salaries of other members of the board vary according to the rises which the board voted to itself after 1929 . Mr. Untermyer had intimated in a letter to the Mayor that such action on the part of the Board of Estimate might be " a , graceful gesture . " He also suggested that the Board of Aldermen fall in with the idea and reduce its members ' salaries from $5,000 to $2,000 ( the 1929 level ) , but this was not taken up so briskly . Mr. Untermyer made these recommendations as a preliminary to wholesale salary reductions for all city officials whose compensation was increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the Aldermen was accepted as a certainty at City Hall last night . How far they would be able to get with their protests remained an open question , since Mr. Untermyer is applying the power of their district leaders to keep them in line . He frankly said that their salary reductions were urged now because of the impending primary and the election , making it thus appear that he was acting in their interest . In 1929 the Board of Estimate increased the Mayor 's salary from $25,000 to $40,000 . The Controller 's salary went from $25,000 to $35,000 and that of the Aldermanic President from $15,000 to $25,000 . The Borough Presidents went from $15,000 to $20,000 . Shortly after these increases , the salaries of department heads and other responsible city officials were raised . In most cases the department heads went from $10,000 to $15,000 a year . The City Chamberlain increased from $12,000 to $15,000 , while the Corporation Counsel received $25,000 instead of his previous salary of $15,000 . Deputy Commissioners in the various departments received increases of from $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayor went from $12,000 to $17,500 , and the Mayor 's secretary got $15,000 instead of $12,000 . Rises in Smaller Brackets . Secretaries in the various departments went up from $500 to $1,000 each . The City Clerk 's compensation was raised to $12,000 from $10,000 . Funds were provided to " maintain the proper differential " between these salaries and those of persons in subordinate positions . Under the recent salary cuts adopted by the Board of Estimate , those increased were cut down on a sliding scale , which became heavier as the salaries mounted . In virtually all cases , however , the new salaries were substantially higher than those paid in 1929 . While Mr. Untermyer made no great point of his attack on salaries in the higher brackets generally , his letter urged that the Board of Estimate cut its own salaries before attempting to reduce the increases generally granted since 1929 . The Board of Estimate conceded that Mr. Untermyer was " sitting in the driver 's seat ; so far as city finances were concerned by acting immediately upon his suggestions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maurice Stephenson to place their salaries in the-1934 budget at the 1929 figures , with the proviso that no rights of the members were waived thereby . This step has the effect of making the salary cuts a subject for discussion . The reductions will not become effective until final adoption of the 1934 budget . In moving adoption of Mr. Untermyer 's recommendation the Mayor said : " The chair moves that the Budget Director be directed to insert in the tentative budget the salaries received by members of this board in 1929 , with the understanding that no rights of any member are waived , that the reductions be a gratuitous contribution by the board and that pension rights be preserved notwithstanding this voluntary contribution to an emergency situation . " Acting Aldermanic President Dennis J. Mahon refrained from voting on the ground that he was a member of the Board of Aldermen . All other members of the board voted for the Mayor 's motion . Mr. Untermyer trained his guns on the Aldermen after they had gone home , satisfied with the results of their day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sitting , they were completely unaware of his plans for them . The Grimm committee on administrative economies recommended $2,500 a year for the Aldermen ; Mr. Untermyer went further with the declaration that $2,000 was quite sufficient to recompense them for the work they did one day a week. , Recognizing that the Aldermen would have to vote on cutting their own salaries , and allowing for a natural reluctance on their part , Mr. Untermyer urged that the nomination or renomination of every member be made conditional on his acceptance of the salary cut . He addressed his recommendations to every Tammany district leader in the city as well as the Board of Estimate . The district ' leaders are in position to enforce his dictum by refusing nominations to the Aldermen unwilling to see the light . The new city taxes on stock brokers and public utilities were amended in both branches yesterday so that the tax falls upon the gross revenues of such concerns instead of upon their gross incomes . Taxing gross incomes would allow for the deduction of operating costs , taxes and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tax regardless of whether the individual business shows a profit . In the case of the stock-brokers ' tax the levy applies now to " gross earnings without reduction whatsoever . " In public utilities it applies to " gross revenues without reduction whatsoever . " Borough President George U. Harvey of Queens overcame the reluctance of city officials to discuss the meaning of the change and forced the issue into the open when the Board of Estimate met . " As I understand these changes , " he said , " they mean that utilities will pay the city a tax of 14 per cent on every dollar they take in . Queens bus companies are now paying the city 10 per cent of their gross earnings ; now they will pay 114 per cent , while companies in other boroughs will pay only 4% per cent . That Is a very serious thing . " " That 's the intent of the tax , " said Arthur J. W. Hilly , Corporation Counsel . " What will you do with the corn1 panies that are already losing money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment , they 're losing money now , they'llslose more with the tax . " sss " That is their own bargain , " Mr. Hilly replied . " Then it does n't make any difference whether they make money or not ; the city still takes 1% per cent of every dollar they receive , " Mr. Harvey said . " If the tax applied to gross profits , " Mr. Hilly explained , " the companies might deduct operating expenses . That was not the intent of the law : The intent was to take 11/2 per cent of their gross revenues . The subways are included in this measure , since it applies to all companies under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission and the Transit Commission . " The original working of the utility tax bill referred to " entire revenues . " ' his wording was changed to " gross profits " last Tuesday , with the official explanation that " entire revenues " had been written in error . The effect of the amendment adopted yesterday by both branches of the Municipal Assembly restores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are identical with gross earnings . Mr. Hilly said the amendments would make no difference in the estimated yield of the tax , leaving the inference that the original estimate was based on gross revenues . The stock brokers ' tax was changed from a tax on " gross profits " to a levy on " gross revenues without deduction whatsoever : " As in the case of utilities the city will thus levy its tax on every dollar received by traders in stocks . 15 Vote Against Water Levy . Though substantial opposition developed in the Board of Aldermen yesterday against the Untermyer tax program , the Democratic majority was sufficiently powerful to put the program through . The strongest fight developed on the proposal to increase water rates 50 per cent , when fifteen members of the board opposed the majority of forty-one . Alderman Joseph Clark Baldwin , only Republican in the board , lost his fight to change the wording of each bill to show that part of the tax money would go to redeem city obligations held by ? bankers , instead of for unemployment alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote favoring that amendment . In addition to Alderman Baldwin , those who voted against raising water rates were Aldermen Corcoran , Dalton , Deutschman , Gallagher , Gardella , Kranz , Bauer , Lenihan , O'Connell , Ott , Reich , Schwab and Borough Presidents George U. Harvey of Queens and John A. Lynch of Richmond . Most of the opposition came from Qu'eens and was inspired by small home owners there . The ? Aldermen passed the fourcent tax on stock transfers by a vote of 47 to 7 . The tax of onequarter of 1 per cent on assets of savings banks and insurance companies went through , 53 to 1 , Alderman Baldwin standing alone in his opposition . The Queens bloc voted against the stock transfer tax , with Aldermen Deutschmann , Gallagher , Kranz , Lenihan , O'Connell and Schwab joining the Republican leader . The bill placing a 5 per cent tax on the gross income of brokerage houses was passed by a vote of 50 to 2 . Alderman Schwab and Alderman Baldwin voted against it . Opposition arose against the bill placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment to the measure the legal maximum rate per mile was cut from 40 cents to 35 . While a majority of cabs are operated at 20 cents a mile , a number operate around terminals and hotels at the 40-cent rate . The bill went through on a vote of 46 to 10 : The ten opponents were Aldermen Baldwin , Kranz , Ott , Deutschmann , Gallagher , Lenihan , O'Connell , Schwab and Borough Presidents Harvey and Lynch . While the votes were being taken . the members chatted amiably among themselves , taking the outcome as a matter of course , Peter J. , Commissioner of Public Works , in Brooklyn , - appealed to the chairman to waive the'rules so that Borough President Harvey might smoke his pipe . Acting President Dennis J. Mahon regretfully informed Mr. Harvey that smoking during the transaction of business was contrary to the rules of the board . After a final statutory public , hearing on the four tax bills passed by both branches of the Municipal Assembly yesterday , they will become effective with the Mayor 's ? signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date for the hearing . The increase in water rates and the five-cent tax on taxi - rides passed by the Aldermen need no concurrent action by the Board of Estimate . Mr. Untermyer estimates a new revenue yield of $40,000,000 from his tax program . The proceeds of the taxes are to be devoted to unemployment relief , including the redemption of about $25,000,000 in city relief securities now held by the bankers . New Grimm Report Filed . The Grimm committee on administrative economies submitted an eighty-page report to Mr. Untermyer yesterday urging budget cuts substantially in excess of the $20,000 , - 000 reduction already outlined in an earlier report . Pending study of the report over the next week Mr. Untermyer declined to discuss its contents . Peter Grimm , chairman of the committee , said the report urged that $8,000,000 be cut from the payroll through elimination of useless jobs . Mr. Untermyer 's recommendations on the Board of Aldermen and City Clerk resulted from his agreement with that portion of the report covering those departments . Assemblyman Louis Cuvillier congratulated the Mayor yesterday on passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange would not carry out its threat to move to New Jersey to escape city taxes . The Equitable Life Assurance So-11 ciety sent letters to its agents asking them to urge individual policy holders to oppose the life insurance company taxes by wire or letter to Mayor O'Brien .
