Thirty years ago only the rich could afford the strange meaty taste of avocado pears . Now avocados cost around a dime apiece instead of $5 . West Indian avocados are grown in Florida , and some 13,000,000 pounds were imported last season from Cuba ( certain spectacular avocados weigh two pounds apiece ) . But most avocados eaten in the U. S. come from California . Californians look down their noses at the West Indian article ; California avocados are Guatemalan or Mexican or a cross beween the two . The Fuerte , a hybrid , called " the sturdy " because it shivered through the Big Freeze of 1913 , makes up 75% of California avocados . <P> In 1911 a young Californian named Carl Schmidt discovered the Fuerte in the patio of Seor Alejandro LeBlanc in Atlixco , Mexico . He sent a few buds back home , the middle classes of the U. S. began to hanker after avocados , and in 1934-35 there was a bumper crop of 20,000,000 pounds which brought in $600,000 to California avocado growers . But last year there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" The pilgrims will go by train ( price of upper berth : $205 ) to see Seor LeBlanc 's parent avocado tree in Atlixco . There , on Easter , they will gather round the tree and listen to numerous complimentary speeches from U. S. Ambassador Josephus Daniels and Mexican dignitaries . They will present a gold medal to Seor LeBlanc , a gold medal to Mr. Schmidt . To the music of Mexican bands they will unveil a tablet , suitably inscribed .
