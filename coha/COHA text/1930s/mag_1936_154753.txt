In a filling station at Land O'Lakes , Wis. one night last week , Harlen Pitts , the 20-year-old attendant , turned to serve two men who had ordered gasoline . Something hard crashed against the back of his skull . Next thing he knew he was kneeling at a bench in the garage next door . Dizzily he tried to get up , discovered he could not . Something was holding his hands . He lost consciousness again . <P> The two men and $160 from the station 's till were gone when his mother found Harlen Pitts still kneeling , one of his hands clamped in a vise , the other held firmly to the bench by a large nail driven through the palm .
