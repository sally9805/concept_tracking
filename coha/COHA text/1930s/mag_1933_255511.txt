Notable were two strikes last week which revealed the impotence of the National Recovery Administration to put down the labor controversies stirred up by NIRA . Both disputes flunked the National Labor Board because nowhere in the law was that agency , an extra-legal body backed only by the President 's prestige , given authority to force settlements in the backwash of NRA code-making . The Ford and coal strikes exemplified the stubborn militancy of Labor to overreach itself , the stubborn militancy of Capital to resist to the limit . <P> The Ford strike involved wages and hours of some 3,000 unorganized workers in Henry Ford 's Chester , Pa. export assembly plant . Though Mr. Ford has not yet signed the automobile code ( which binds him just the same ) he pays his men a minimum wage ( 50 per hour ) which is 7 higher than the trade agreement requires . But because of the seasonal peaks and valleys of automobile production , Mr. Ford did not have enough work to run his Chester plant more than four days a week . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck for a five-day week at a $25 minimum . Mr. Ford retaliated by closing his Chester plant indefinitely . The strikers moved on the Ford plant at Edgewater , N.J. , attempted to enlist its 2,000 workers in a sympathy strike , talked of closing every Ford factory in the land . Observers predicted that before matters reached such a pass , Henry Ford would shut up shop entirely , let the workers stew in their own juice . No law could force him , or any other manufacturer , to reopen . <P> Last week 's other important strike involved recognition of United Mine Workers by the " captive " soft coal mines of Pennsylvania . These mines are owned and their entire output is used by the great non-union iron and steel companies . Last fortnight U. M. W. won complete recognition from most commercial mine operators in a blanket wage contract under the coal code . Because that contract did not include the " captive " mines of U. S. Steel Corp. , Bethlehem Steel and others , some 75,000 Pennsylvania diggers under Insurgent Martin Ryan refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first balked at U. M. W. recognition at their " captive mines " lest it prove an entering wedge for the unionization of their steel workers . The steel companies were ready to give their miners everything but that - and that was the one thing the U. M. W. miners were standing out for . <P> Last week the steelmasters , as a voluntary peace move , agreed to run their mines in concert with the coal code , giving their men the same wages and hours as prevail in commercial mines . This agreement was promptly approved by President Roosevelt in the hope of placating the strikers . But they stayed out , insisting that the steelmen must give them full recognition . When virtual recognition seemed attained last week , U. M. W. leaders ordered the 75,000 strikers back to work .
