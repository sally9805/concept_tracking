Step by step , like a long-harried elephant finally facing an enemy , Britain last week turned in her tracks . It was an impressive and world-shaking spectacle . Hard as it is for Britain to change , in one short week she turned her back on a longestablished policy of no military commitments in Europe east of the Rhine-turned , whole-elephant , and guaranteed that the British Fleet , along with the French Army ( and the combined Air Forces of the two nations ) would fight to protect the States of Eastern Europe from further Nazi aggression . <P> For Britain the step marked the end of a six years ' effort , to get along with Adolf Hitler . Time after time Fhrer Hitler has torn up treaties , ignored agreements , threatened neighboring States with invasion . As many times Britain has looked the other way . When , three weeks ago , the Fhrer moved into a Czechoslovakia which he had already dismembered last autumn , even the most credulous of British statesmen were shocked . They recognized then that Herr Hitler had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than domination of Europe , if not the world . Last week they reacted . <P> Flush from the Czech seizure , the Fhrer began to threaten Poland . The German Army was already partly mobilized . Troops were moved toward the Polish Corridor and toward Danzig , the Free City on the Baltic , where Poland has large interests and investments . East Prussia had become an armed camp . Finally the Nazi Government submitted its demands : German absorption of Danzig , a German auto road across the Polish Corridor , a Polish signature on the German-Italian-Japanese anti-Comintern Pact . <P> Poland 's hour of unequal struggle with the Nazi giant seemed at hand . Poland with a bigger population ( 34,000,000 ) , bigger area ( 150,000 sq . mi. ) , bigger standing Army ( 285,000 ) than Czecho-Slovakia was too big a nation to let fall into Germany 's hands . So fortnight ago the British Government hastily offered a watery anti-aggression pact , but the hard-boiled Polish Government insisted on strict military guarantees with no ifs , ands or buts . <P> Last week Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hushed , crowded House of Commons 70-year-old Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain , former arch-exponent of appeasing the dictators , announced that Britain and France were negotiating with Eastern European nations ( understood to include Poland , Soviet Russia , Rumania , Turkey , Yugoslavia , Greece ) a tight system of military agreements to resist further Nazi aggression . In the meantime , moreover , the British Government was prepared to consider the Vistula , the river that flows through the Polish Corridor , just as much its frontier as it has long considered the Rhine . He added : <P> " In the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces , His Majesty 's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend all the support in their power . They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect . "
