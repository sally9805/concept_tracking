THE Arab strike , which lasted six months , is over ; violence , too , has temporarily subsided . The 30,000 soldiers whom Britain has dextrously slipped into Palestine will maintain order as a side duty  --  until something happens . A leading Arab said to me : " Either a European war will break out in a year or two or it will not . If war comes , we shall have our chance because England will not be able to keep so many soldiers here . If it does n't , we shall have another chance because England will withdraw some of the troops anyway . " A Royal Commission will soon arrive to investigate the last outbreak and suggest a solution that will prevent bloodshed in the future . But Palestine has had commissions in the past . They have issued voluminous reports but they have not brought peace . Neither Arabs or Zionists are optimistic about the results of the new commission . British commissions are designed to safeguard British interests , not to help the country . Only an Arab-Zionist understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . Some fifteen months of study on the spot have convinced me that to make a report on Palestine one must begin at the beginning , even though no land has rated so many words per square foot . Palestine is very small . Its total area is approximately 10,000 square miles , not much larger than the state of New Jersey , and it has less good agricultural land . The exact area of cultivable land is unknown  --  after nineteen years of British rule . Guesses range from 1,500,000 acres to more than double that amount . A conservative estimate , I believe , would set it at 2,500,000 acres . The Jews are constantly discovering new sources of underground water , and a hydro-geologic investigation might disclose abundant water in what is now considered desert . No such investigation has been made , though the government is enjoined by the terms of the mandate to " encourage close settlement by Jews on the land . " Since the Zionists want to settle tens of thousands of Jewish families as farmers , the question whether there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest census 54 per cent of the population derive a living from agriculture . But the Arab peasants own only 60 per cent of the land they cultivate ; 29 per cent of the peasants own no land at all ; and about 47 per cent depend for their livelihood on secondary outside occupations . Consequently the poverty of the Arab village is almost unimaginable . The low and windowless one-room hut , made of mud and dried dung , is shared by the whole family and its few emaciated animals . There is no sign of furniture ; all sleep on the ground . A long cotton dress resembling the old-fashioned nightshirt lasts the fellah for yearS . His diet is poor and monotonous . Thin cakes of bread made of impure flour , together with a few radishes or onions , make up his morning and evening meals ; his main meal , taken in the afternoon , consists usually of a thick vegetable soup . Sickness is constant , blindness is horribly frequent , and the rate of infant mortality is 147 per 1,000 births . The miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the scarcity of land . First of all , he does not like to overwork himself ; second , he is totally ignorant of modern methods of agriculture and his implements are extremely primitive ; third , he is weighed down by a burden of debt on which he pays interest that is rarely lower than 30 per cent , frequently 100 per cent or even more . The prosperous Christian inhabitants of Nazareth and the Moslems of Nablus owe their wealth to the usury they practice on the fellaheen of the neighboring villages . When the debt burden becomes hopeless , as frequently happens in all Oriental lands , the interest sharks take over the little farm , and one more fellah becomes landless . This , and the Turkish custom of endowing court favorites with large estates , has given rise to the fourth and worst evil  --  feudal landlordism . In this land of poverty and death the Zionists have done a great work . They have drained tens of thousands of acres of deadly swamps ; they have reclaimed at tremendous human and financial cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange groves where there was desert yesterday . The two colonies of PetakhTikvah and Hederah are typical . Until the coming of the Jews both were malarial marshes , inhabited by a few half-starved , disease-ridden Bedouin families . Today Petakh-Tikvah supports a population of 18,000 , Hederah of 5,000 . Thousands of acres of orange groves surround both colonies . In Hederah eucalyptus trees are the only remaining signs of the once deadly swamp . A railroad station and a large modern orange-packing house now stand on the site . During a walking trip through Palestine last spring , my companion and I traversed in the Jordan Valley thousands of acres of excellent agricultural land . " And one could get water from the Jordan for irrigating it , " my companion remarked . Small patches here and there were cultivated , but the Arabs had not even removed the stones which littered the fields . During a good ten-hour walk we did not see a single village ; only a few friendly Bedouins grazing their sheep as Abraham 's ancestors used to do . Suddenly , around four in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures . We found them to be four settlers . After giving us water and preparing seats under their wagon  --  which cast the only shade within miles  --  they told us their story . The Jewish National Fund bought here about 750 acres , on which 150 families will eventually settle . These four had been sent to prepare the land . For the last year they had been picking up stones ; with pride they pointed to piles of stones that dotted the fields . In the summer the Jordan Valley is a burning furnace . There are scorpions , black and red , under the The NATION stones ; as a result of their bite men have gone crazy from pain , which lasts about two weeks . In the few days we remained there , I insisted on helping them pick up stones , and I saw for myself those ugly little venomous creatures . The stones will be used eventually for building . Meanwhile , day after day and month after month , four men are picking up stones in the Valley of the Jordan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies could be done for the whole country . Not only is there enough land to allow the present agricultural population to enjoy a decent standard of living , but there is enough to support additional Jewish settlement . While the Arab fellah starves on thirty acres , the Jew prospers on five . As long as the Arab waste of land continues , however , there is little if any land for new settlement ; moreover , if Jewish settlement continues on its past scale , there can be no doubt that it will spell the ruin of an increasing number of Arab peasants . A. Granovsky , of the Jewish National Fund , claims that only 688 peasants have been displaced in the plains of Esdraelon and Acre , but evidence presented before the coin-mission which investigated the 1929 disturbances showed that about 2,000 had been so displaced . At least a few hundred more were forced off the land around Jaffa . What is likely to happen unless a fundamental agricultural revolution is carried through is indicated by the bloody fights in Wadi Hawareth between the new settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Haifa , where an Arab was shot dead by the police who were carrying out a court order for eviction . With fundamental changes in the agricultural set-up , a certain number of Jewish families could be settled , though the cost would be extremely high . The exact number of families is of course unpredictable , but it would not run into six figures , as Zionists claim . E. Volcani , head of the Agricultural Experiment Station at Rehovoth , who undoubtedly knows more about Palestine agriculture than anybody else , said to me last winter : " I used to speak of settling 100,000 families here . I now recognize that hope to have been a sin of youthfulness . " Possibly room could be found for 25,000 families . Settling even that many would be a gigantic task involving the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars . So far , after half a century of intensive effort , not more than a third of that number have been settled at a cost of $6,000 to $12,000 per family . The cost of land in Palestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had for less than $600 an acre . For political reasons , however , many Zionists are opposed to any scheme which would further Jewish settlement and at the same time cause the non-Jewish inhabitants to strike deeper roots in the soil . " Every new Arab house , every additional acre of Arab orange plantation , scares me more than all their political demonstrations and speeches , " a Zionist leader once said to me as we passed the Arab orange groves around Jaffa . Just as the Zionist ambition to settle millions of Jews on the land could not be realized even if the Arab fellah were squeezed out entirely , so also is the project of developing industries which will give employment to December 19 , 1936 millions doomed to failure . Not only is Palestine small , but it is extremely poor in natural resources . It has no , coal , no iron , no timber  --  none of the raw materials with which modern industry is fed . The Jordan River supplies a certain amount of electricity , but its capacities are very limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important natural resources are the chemicals of the Dead Sea , for which a British-Jewish company now holds a concession . The industry so far developed by the Jews , though unprecedented for the Near East , is small-scale industry serving mainly the local Jewish market . Its index of production has risen from 100 in 1920 to 380 in 1935 , and it is giving employment to about 30,000 workers . About $40,000,000 is now invested in industry , compared to about $12,000,000 in 1930 . Consumption of electricity , increased from 8,707,917 kilowatt hours in 1931 to 34 , - 385,515 kilowatt hours three years later . But this rate of development , while revealing tremendous progress in a short time , can not be maintained in the future . In fact , it would appear that most of the industries have already reached the peak of development . It is certain , at least , that an industrial slump has set in , although at least $100,000,000 in local banks is awaiting productive investment . Nearly all the factories now in existence have had extremely checkered careers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chocolate factory , and the sole iron foundry in the country went bankrupt and were reorganized by creditors at a quarter of the original investment . The only factories which have had even a moderate success are those connected with construction and those dependent upon raw material locally available . The tremendous immigration of the last few years has caused an exceptional boom in the building trade and has given employment to tens of thousands . But this can not continue indefinitely ; a serious slump has already set in . The healthiest industry is citrus-growing , and the area under cultivation can probably be doubled . This will make room for a few thousand families . But markets have first to be found for the excellent Palestinian oranges ; this is not easy , and land prices will have to go down before citrus-growing becomes profitable again . A number of canning and preserving establishments have fared well . And that is all . If this review of Palestine industry is somewhat disappointing , the fault is with the Zionist ballyhoo that has surrounded it . Palestine has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between $600,000,000 and $750,000,000 has been invested in this desert during the last quarter of a century . That is a lot of money . The life of the Jewish worker is not easy , and the wages of Arabs , even in government work , are about half those of Jews . Wages of $25 a month for men and $15 for women are above the average for Jews . Prices are high ; food costs here from two to three times as much as in the United States , and rent is as high as in New York City . Thousands of employed workers live on a pound of bread and a few uncooked vegetables each day . Very few know the meaning of steady employment ; the vast majority727 come at least once a week to the union office in search of work . The much-advertised prosperity of the last two years was due entirely to a vast influx of capitalist immigrants , who did not know what to do with their money , and to land speculation . Land prices rocketed sky-high , and by transferring unpaid-for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making money . Faced with the country 's inherent industrial limitations , the Zionists have tried to save every available job for Jewish immigrants . Not out of wickedness did the system of kibush avodah , " conquest of work , " arise , but out of strictly economic and political considerations . Zionists do not like to picket establishments employing Arabs , and it is not hatred that drives them to eject , often violently , Arab laborers from their places of employment . One of the leaders of the Jerusalem Federation of Jewish Labor once put their case very clearly : Jewish capital has created here new sources of employment . And there is no lack of workers here and in the neighboring countries . It will take years and years , in fact , to abolish the tremendous unemployment in this part of the world . The native workers are cheap ; their standard of living is so low that the Jewish worker can not possibly compete with them . The tendency of the capitalist is therefore to hire cheap , unorganized native laborers . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish capitalists or to provide work for unemployed Arabs . We want here a large Jewish population , which means Jewish workers , and this we can achieve only by safeguarding every Jewish-created place of work for Jewish workers . We do not want to place Jewish workers in Arab enterprises , but we will fight to the last for every Jewish-created job . While the Zionists are right from their point of view , the Arab worker who has been expelled from his job by Histadruth pickets does not become friendlier to Zionism . No doubt kibush avodah is responsible to a large extent for the latest disturbances . One of the first Arabs I met when I came here more than a year ago was a doctor who spoke bitterly against Zionism . I enumerated to him the blessings the Zionists have conferred on them . " Who denies it ? " he replied . " But do they do it because they have our interests at heart or because they want to bribe us to keep quiet as long as they are the minority ? Even now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make room for additional immigrants . Do you know that not a day passes without Davar campaigning for ' 100 per cent pure Jewish labor ' in all Jewish enterprises ? Here " ? and from his drawer he pulled out a pack of clippings ? " here are some of the items Davar has published during the last few days . On October 26 it came out with an editorial asking the government why no Jewish laborers were employed in building the new military airport at Lydda ; in Petakh-Tikvah the largest Jewish village the efforts of the Histadruth to conquer for the Jewish worker a place in agriculture have borne fruit , and letters have been sent to Jewish orange-grove owners demanding the employment of pure Jewish labor . The following day Davar reported a battle between Histadruth pickets and the Arab laborers , and Davar could not understand ' why 728 the government had to warn the Histadruth leaders against disturbing the peace . ' In a front-page editorial on the same day it declared , ' The attempt to smuggle in Arab laborers at Ranaana . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only after our workers lost time and strength , after arrests and trials ! ' I can not find the clippings for the following three days , " he continued , " though I am certain that I had some , but on October 31. , under the heading ' Juice from Jewish Fruit , ' it took up the gauntlet , and went into raptures about kiosk owners who decided to use for their juices fruit from groves employing Jewish labor only . ' On the following day the paper reported the arrest of two members of the communistic settlement ' Makhar ' for driving Arab workers from a Jewish grove against the wishes of the owner . " Can Palestine 's industry be developed sufficiently to absorb new immigrants ? That is the central question . The answer is that millions of immigrants can not be absorbed ; thousands can . Industries depending on locally grown fruit  --  that is , industries in which labor plays a paramount role in creating values  --  can be further developed . So far Palestine industry has not been able to compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last ten years . The growing antagonism of the l surrounding Arab countries to Zionism does not help Palestine industry to capture the vast Arab hinterland . In fact , the Arabs have launched a boycott which is very much felt . Also industry is developing in neighboring countries in which even lower wages prevail . And it should not be forgotten that Palestine is already one of the most densely populated countries in the world . Argentina has a population of 3.6 persons per square kilometer , Canada 1.5 , Australia 0.8 , New Zealand 0.5 . In Palestine there are 85 persons to each square kilometer ! Even highly industrialized Europe does not have such , density : France has a population of 73 to every square kilometer , Poland 70 , Austria 78 , Rumania 58 . The United States has 15 . The present population of Palestine is around 1,300 , - 000 , of which 950,000 are Arabs and about 400,000 are Jews . Unless science discovers a method of making butter from sunshine and bread from rocks , the saturation point will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that the country can support many more than 3,000,000 souls , while some put the figure considerably below that maximum . The Arab population , though the death-rate is very high , increases at the rate of 27 per 1,000 ; it has increased by about 32 per cent in the last fourteen years . At this rate of increase there will be about 1,000,000 Arabs by 1955 . At best , then , there is little hope for a significant Jewish majority . Even if all political barriers were removed , and immigration unrestricted , it is likely that during the next twenty years about a million Jews would immigrate , bringing the total population of Palestine - to about 3,000,000 . This , I am convinced , is the most optimistic prognosis that can be made . This is the first of two articles by Mr. Viton . They will be followed by a discussion of the Zionist position by Philip S. Bernstein and by a group of letters representing various points of view.               @ @ @ @ @ @
