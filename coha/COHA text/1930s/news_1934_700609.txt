txt Mr. Rogers Makes Public A Little Inside Stuff To the Editor of The New York Times : SAN FRANCISCO , May 2 . ? See where the S. Chamber of Corntierce are gathered in Washington again . It 's the caviar of big business . Last time they met I happened to be in Washington and was the guest of Jesse Jones ( head of the Reconstruction Finance ) at their dinner . Now the whole constitution , bylaws and secret ritual of the Orchid Club is to " keep the government out of business . " Well , that 's all right , for everorganization must have a purpose , but here was the joke : They introduced all the big financiers  --  the head of this , that and the other . As each stood up Jesse would write on the back of the menu card just what he had loaned him from the R.F.C. ( I got that menu card yet ) . Yet , they say " keep the government out of business . " Yours , WILL ROGERS .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
