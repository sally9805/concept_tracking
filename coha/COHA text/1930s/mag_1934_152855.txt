In thousands of churches throughout the land this Sunday , devout Catholics will drop 1 in a plate in the vestibule , help themselves to copies of a magazine named Catholic Missions . On its rotogravure cover they behold a sea- &-sunset; scene captioned : " Enchanted Isles . In the islands of the South Seas 1,566 missioner priests , brothers and nuns are laboring efficiently among 1,835,030 natives . " Thumbing through its 24 smooth , substantial pages , readers see rotogravures of the Pope in a procession , a Chinese moppet learning the rosary , a Japanese babe on an old man 's back , Indian nuns and Chinese priests , a pagan temple , a Chinese junk , a U. S. pickaninny . Of all the well-chosen , well-reproduced photographs , the one most likely to cause pause is captioned : " Taxi ? Here is the Mongolian version of the taxicab , with its toothless and carefree Jehu . Outer Mongolia presents many problems . . . . But its missioners watch and wait patiently- a policy borne out by the Church 's 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic paying his penny for Catholic Missions will marvel that it could be produced so cheaply . Few will be aware that it is not only the first religious picture magazine but also the biggest job of rotogravure ever clone in the U. S.- 2,843,000 copies of the first issue . That its price was shaved to 1 is chiefly due to the work of a boyish young priest named Rev. James G. Keller . <P> A member of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America at Maryknoll , N. Y. , Father Keller was borrowed this year by his Church 's biggest missionary organization , the Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith . He discussed with his superior , Rt . Rev. Monsignor William Quinn , his ideas for making a quarterly pictorial of Catholic Missions , which S. P. F. had been publishing for ten years . Father Keller had in mind increasing its circulation from 80,000 to 500,000 . Distribution would cost little because each issue could be sent out by freight , disposed of in the churches by the Society 's diocesan directors . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the seven rich , Catholic , Detroit brothers . He told Mr. Fisher he wished Catholic Missions might take on some of the smooth quality of Fisher Body advertising . Nothing was simpler , said Mr. Fisher who sent Father Keller to Erwin , Wasey &; Co. , the Manhattan firm which handles Fisher advertising . Erwin , Wasey agreed to edit captions , help lay out the pictures-for nothing . In three months Father Keller had his pictorial . Advance copies so impressed churchmen that they stepped up their orders to as many as 250,000 copies in big dioceses . As Catholic Missions went on sale this Sunday Father Keller and S. P. F. felt content to recover .9 for paper and printing , .1 for distributing each copy .
