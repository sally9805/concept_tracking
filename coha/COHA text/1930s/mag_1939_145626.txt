Forty years ago a sharp-nosed , ascetic British antiquarian named Cecil Sharp noted that in certain remote parts of England , primitive villagers dressed themselves in strange costumes and skittered through peculiar dance steps unknown to most civilized Britishers . Poking sharply about among the archives of the British Museum , he discovered that many of these dance steps were as old as all get-out , some of them pre-Christian . Sharp de cided that the archaic struts &; stomps of Yorkshire , Durham and Northumberland should be revived . With this in mind , he founded the English Folk-Dance Society in 1911 . Periodically the society 's members would get together for a hop , skip and a jump , trick themselves out in peasant costume and practice morris and sword dancing . <P> At first these capers went comparatively unnoticed , though one Cockney butler , after witnessing a performance of Sharp 's dancers on his master 's premises , remarked : " Thank God we 've got a navy . " But such old-world dances as " Shepherds ' Hey , " " Lumps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Merry , Merry Milkmaids " and " Picking up Sticks " fascinated England 's more esthetic youths and maidens . In 1915 Sharp went to the U. S. and himself founded the English Folk-Dance Society 's Manhattan branch . U. S. dancers , who had not yet forgotten their Virginia reels and square dances , proved as apt as their English colleagues . Today , the society 's hopping and hey-nonnying is systematically carried on in more than ten U. S. cities , and in dozens of U. S. colleges and schools . <P> When Founder Cecil Sharp died in 1924 , the leadership of the English Folk-Dance Society passed to a big-eared London biologist named Douglas Kennedy . So absorbed in folk dancing did Biologist Kennedy become that he gave up biology . Today he is regarded as No. i antiquarian jitterbug . Last week at Manhattan 's New School for Social Research the cream of U. S. folk dancers gathered to welcome him to the U. S. , and to strut a few steps with him . Clad in white trousers or long green shifts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gathering Peascods and The Old Mole . <P> Also present was John Powell , U. S. composer and folk pundit , with a brace of hillbilly musicians . While the panting peascodders rested , " Uncle Jim " Chisholm , of Albemarle County , Va. , played crusty mountain tunes on the fiddle , and lean , grey-haired Horton Barker sang frittery ballads through his nose . For a while it looked as though Ballad Singer Barker 's more ribald offerings might stop the show . But they shushed him and cleared the atmosphere by dancing Flowers of Edinburgh .
