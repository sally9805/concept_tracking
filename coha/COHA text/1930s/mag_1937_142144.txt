Bewildered Hollywoodsters Sirs : <P> HAVING JUST LOCKED OURSELVES IN ROOM AND TAKEN LARGE DOSE OF RUSSIAN " CONFESSION GAS " MENTIONED IN YOUR SHALL WE SAY DELIGHTFULLY UNBIASED ARTICLE ON THE SOVIET TRIALS TIME , Feb. 8 , WE FIND WE HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE . WE CONFESS WE ARE BEWILDERED . STARTING WITH LIBERALS ' ASSUMPTION THAT POSSIBLY THE RUSSIAN EXPERIMENT SHOULD NOT BE ENTIRELY DISCOURAGED , BEING BASED ON AT LEAST AS HIGH IDEALS OF HUMAN PROGRESS AS THOSE OF CERTAIN WELL KNOWN FINANCIAL SUPPORTERS OF WHAT WAS HIS NAME OH YES LANDON , CONTINUING WITH THE FURTHER LIBERAL ASSUMPTION THAT POSSIBLY THE HITLER EXPERIMENT IN NAZIISM IS NOT QUITE WHAT IS MEANT BY DEMOCRACY , WE MUST CONFESS THAT WE CA N'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT TROTSKY AND HIS FOLLOWERS ARE DRIVING AT WHEN THEY ALLY THEMSELVES WITH MR . HITLER AND OTHERS IN A FRANTIC ATTEMPT TO UPSET THE RUSSIAN APPLECART AT ANY COST . OF COURSE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RUSSIAN TRIALS WERE QUITE AS PHONEY AS TIME WITH PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE IF SOMEWHAT UNINFORMED PREJUDICE SUGGESTS , AND IT IS ALSO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IF STALIN AND THE ENTIRE SOVIET GOVERNMENT WERE MURDERED AND THE U.S.S.R. BLASTED INTO DEMORALIZED CONFUSION AND THE UKRAINE GIVEN TO NAZI GERMANY AND CERTAIN CONCESSIONS MADE TO FASCIST JAPAN WHICH WOULD ASSIST THEM IN A FUTURE WAR ON DEMOCRATIC AMERICA , BUT , AGAIN , WE MUST CONFESS THAT WE DO N'T SEE WHY ALL THIS SHOULD BE DONE UNDER MR . TROTSKY 'S BANNER OF " THE ONE AND ONLY RELIABLE " BRAND OF SOCIALISM . WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO MEDDLE IN RUSSIAN OR INTERNATIONAL POLITICS BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AS AMERICANS IF THERE IS NOT A DANGER TO OUR OWN COUNTRY IN THIS BACKHANDED ASSISTANCE TO FASCISM UNDER THE GUISE OF MAKING THE WORLD SAFE FOR TROTSKY . AS WE UNDERSTAND IT FIREMEN ARE NOT USUALLY EXPECTED TO BLOW UP THE HOME IN ORDER TO SAVE THE OUTHOUSE . <P> DONALD OGDEN STEWART DUDLEY NICHOLS Hollywood , Calif . <P> Not the least interested in making the world safe for Trotsky , or in seeing Stalin murdered , or vice versa , was TIME in reporting as clearly and objectively as possible the devious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolsheviks. - ED . <P> Friend of Franco <P> Sirs : Remember that Russians and Russian equipment are largely responsible for General Miaja 's " spunkiness " TIME , Feb. 8 . Also bear in mind that the whole army had repudiated your " spunky " General , but that he was the only man that the Azana Government at that time could get to take the post of Minister of War . The only man on whom they could rely to do their bidding . The man who had pocketed the soldier 's pay , and other little genteel acts along those lines . I quote from a letter smuggled out of Madrid : " It is certain that the militia had not the courage to go out and fight the battle in the open but have consistently run back into the city where they are now skulking in among the women and children and howling to all nations that Franco is bombing their women and kids ! They have not even honored the neutral zone which Franco indicated the womenfolk would be free from bombs for this area is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gone to Valencia and the officers of the brave Junta de Defensa.
