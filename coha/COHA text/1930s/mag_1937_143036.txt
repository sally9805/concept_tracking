THE RETURN OF KAI LUNG-Ernest Bramah-Sheridan House ( $2.50 ) . <P> " It is possible to escape from an enemy carrying a two-edged sword but not from the interference of a well-meaning woman . " Such Wodehousian sentiments garbed in Confucian terms are the unmistakable trade-mark of Ernest Bramah ( E. B. Smith ) . His Kai Lung stories , which first began to appear 37 years ago and have been coming out at lengthy intervals ever since , have long delighted patient readers on both sides of the Atlantic . Their low-keyed humor , chess-game pace and subacid satire give them an effect somewhat less than sidesplitting , but for readers who like their slyness slow and stately , Ernest Bramah is a lordly dish . And The Return of Kai Lung shows that his salt has not lost its savor for being kept so long in the attic . <P> T'sin Wong , a mandarin of much potency and some parts , was considerably dismayed when he awoke one morning to find his pigtail gone . A hastily-convened assembly of wise men was not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy declared that within three days a mendicant would appear at the city gates who would make all clear . In due time the mendicant appeared , turned out to be a professional expresser of public apologies and an old drunk into the bargain . Luckily for himself he had with him his granddaughter , Hwa-che , who knew all about solving crimes from reading English detective stories . Hwa-che 's first few casts did credit to her training but instead of solving the mystery got herself and several other people into terrible trouble . How everything was enabled to come so deliciously right in the end is the professional secret of Author Bramah . <P> Though Bramah characters are , almost invariably , excruciatingly polite no matter what their feelings , they occasionally break into such plain- &-fancy; cussing as " Thou concave-eyed and mentally bed-ridden offspring of a bald-seated she-dog ! " Their chief delight , however , is in apt aphorisms : ' ' Two resolute men acting in concord may transform an Empire , but an ordinarily resourceful duck can escape from a dissentient rabble " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to attempt to discriminate among their various degrees of iniquity is both foolish and discourteous.
