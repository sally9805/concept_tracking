Professor John Madigan of St. Thomas ' College ( St. Paul , Minn. ) is tired of marking stupid examination papers for his class in physics . Last week 's batch was particularly exasperating . Some of the papers reminded him of dead fish and rotten eggs . When he handed the papers back to their authors , he did so in a new way . None of the papers was marked , but flunkers found theirs in a jar from which came the rotten-egg stench of hydrogen sulphide . The papers of even more hopeless dummies Professor Madigan had permeated with butyric acid , for a smell worse than Limburger cheese . Able students were odoriferously rewarded . The jar from which they drew their papers had been fragrantly scented with attar of roses .
