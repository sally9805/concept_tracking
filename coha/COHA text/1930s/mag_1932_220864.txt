At the press of a button by Governor Rolph in California , a plane despatcher at Newark Airport , N. J. waved his red flag one night last week at a Ford tri-motor , just christened The Comet . ( Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh who had been expected to act as despatcher watched from the background . ) Pilot Robert Le Roy raced his idling motors , taxied across the floodlit field ; The Comet roared up into the western night . Next evening it alighted in Los Angeles . <P> Thus last week Transcontinental &; Western Air inaugurated the fastest transcontinental service in the U. S. Unusual for an inaugural flight , the plane was loaded with twelve paying passengers , no deadheads . The company had loosely publicized the new run as a 24-hour service . Actually it is 25 hr. 43 min. westbound by standard time ; flying time three hours longer . Eastbound the elapsed standard time is 27 hr. 40 min. ; flying time , three hours less . <P> The T. &; W. A. line is an outgrowth of the old Transcontinental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 hr. air- &-rail; trip three years ago . Last year it began to operate an all-air service for passengers , but included an overnight stop in Kansas City . It took 36 hours . The new Comet schedule was made possible by perfecting night-flying facilities . <P> United 's No. 7 , United Air Lines , which has promised a literal 24-hr. schedule when its new Boeings are in full flight , last week improved transcontinental service by juggling timetables and adding a new connection at Salt Lake City . Result : Passengers out of Newark at midnight on United 's new No. 7 reach San Francisco at 6:30 a. m. the second day ; or by switching off at Salt Lake City , land in Los Angeles about the same time . Advantage : loss of only one business day . Businessmen approve of the timing of the schedule 's eastern leg . Midnight planes leaving either New York or Chicago land at the opposite port about 7 a. m.                    @
