MIA THE BUSTLE AN EPISODE OF THE EIGHTIES BY CHARLES MACOMB FLANDRAU " IT MIGHT be in the attic , " I suggested , " although I do n't know exactly where . " No one has ever returned from our attic empty-handed , but it is almost equally true that no one ever brings back what he originally went up to find , and Clark that afternoon proved no exception . " I did n't seem to come across it , " he explained when he reappeared at the end of half an hour , " but I did bring down this thing because I ca n't make out what it could have been used for , " he added as he deposited on my lap an oddly shaped construction of steel wire . " It looks something like a baseball mask , but of course it is n't . At first I thought it might be part of a bird cage , but the wires are too far apart ; the birds would get out . What is it ? " Tenderly , affectionately , sentimentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audibly sighed . " Yes , " I answered , " I do know what it is . It 's a bustle . " " A bustle ? " Clark repeated on a puzzled , a mystified note . " What on earth is a bustle ? I never heard of one . " With a sudden overpowering sense of time 's onward rush , I realized that although he was more than thirty years old , bustles had come and bustles had gone even before he had been born . " A bustle , " I began  --  but even as I did so I felt that to one of Clark 's generation , whose brief and infrequent excursions into literature concern themselves strictly with the contemporaneous , my attempt to define a bustle would be scarcely more intelligible than a learned antiquarian 's discourse on a suit of medieval armor . " But I ca n't see why they did it , " he protested when I had finished . " Take my wife , for instance  --  she 's actually been starving herself for months and tiring herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so afraid of , well , you know , sticking out behind , " he reticently explained . " The one thing she dreads more than sticking out in front is sticking out behind . But those people " ( and " those people " as he said it sounded like something overheard in a museum of Etruscan or Egyptian remains ) " those people must have wanted to . Why ? " " Yes , incredible as it may seem to you , they distinctly wanted to , " I agreed ; " but I ca n't undertake to make it clear to you ( not to-day anyhow ) why the ideal has so entirely changed  --  gone to the other extreme . That 's a job for a historian ? a historian with a talent for the philosophy of a  --  sthetics . " " But did n't they look terribly funny with that great , bulbous wire basket hanging on to them under their skirts ? Did n't you nearly die laughing ? " Clark persisted . " No  --  not in the least , " I somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be anything funny about it . The only women who looked funny in those days were the very few women in town who did n't wear them " ; and I recalled the several well-known ladies who simply never indulged in bustles and were always explained and condoned by the fact that they were profoundly intellectual . One , I remember , was a school-teacher who read Sanskrit and Greek for relaxation , and another was a Unitarian who corresponded with Ralph Waldo Emerson . Among their high thoughts the bustle did not mingle . Clark at length left me with the platitudinous declaration that he had long considered it a waste of time to try to understand women anyhow , and for an hour I reverted to matters in which he had not and never could have a share , but which to me were as vivid and as recent as if they had happened during the past week instead of rather unbelievably far back in the past century . " Queer , queer , " I mused , " this wire contraption on my lap has become nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and not really so long ago ) of supreme importance . It was , all in all , the most ubiquitous feature of the landscape . In my childhood it had the universality that nowadays is exemplified only by the automobile . In a city of three hundred thousand inhabitants , it may be that to-day this is actually the only bustle left . One 's ideal of female loveliness was unquestionably akin to that of the Hottentot ; but in the eighteen eighties it was a fact that without a bustle female loveliness simply did not  --  could not  --  exist . It was preeminently an era of gelatinous convexities and women , unfortunate in having been by the Creator scantily upholstered half way down behind and rather high up in front , resorted without scruple to the medium of art . The bustle and the " form improver " molded not only anatomies but entire lives ; they determined female fates -- ehanged destinies . In my hearing at an early age a young man passionately declared that he had decided never to propose to a certain girl because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by God , that there 's deception in that bust . " More often than not the size and set of a bustle wasan index of character  --  a barometer of morals . Mrs. Bates , the wife of a major stationed at the Fort , always wore a conspicuously , an astoundingly , large one . It shot out abruptly , even violently , from the base of her spine like a shelf ( without the slightest danger one could have stood a glass of water or a plate of soup on it ) and then , in a long , dashing , thrilling curve , swooped all the way down to the ground and about two feet beyond . Hers was a challenging , a defiant , a brazen bustle . " I like Mrs. Bates , " I once announced when at the end of an afternoon call she had rattled away to the Fort in the shabby old leather ambulance drawn by four fiends in the guise of mules . " She may be a kind-hearted woman , " my maiden aunt grudgingly conceded with sudden thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at her bustle . " The bustle , too , served on occasions as a kind of ambulatory showcase , or exhibition grounds . At the annual charity ball , for instance , for women of a certain age , a projecting , overhanging , black-velvet backside draped like a mantelpiece or a bureau with little lambrequins of one 's most expensive lace , was almost obligatory  --  a kind of dress uniform . And , as they were the fashion , enormously fat women as a matter of course wore them quite as universally as did the thin ones . " When a woman built like Mrs. Gilman ties a bustle to herself , " my father once declared at the dinner table , " it 's like piling Pelion on  --  on . " " On Assa , " my half-brother brilliantly interposed . At which my mother , with wholly unconvincing severity , ordered him to leave the table and the room and not come back . I had n't forgotten these far off things , but for years I had n't thought of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hectic , the historical and hysterical autumn evening while my father was reading the Dispatch in the library after dinner , he suddenly looked up and demanded that morning 's Pioneer Press . In the Dispatch he had come across a somewhat vague and sketchy reference to something ( a lawsuit , no doubt ) that in the morning paper had been treated of at length but which , in the hurry of getting to the courthouse in time , had escaped his eye . As usual , he was in his big chair at one side of the library table , I was at its farther end , sitting on the ledge of the bookcase , trying to " do " my arithmetic for the following day . Mother was leaning back in a rocking-chair near the fire . In the dining room across the hall Aunt Dottie and my half-brother John were playing backgammon while grandmother , under the cast-iron dining-room chandelier that held six kerosene lamps ( there were in the house thirty-six kerosene lamps , every one of which had to be cleaned and refilled every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knitted thing , known in those days as " a cloud . " " The Pioneer Press ? " echoed my mother . " I 'll get it for you . It 's probably in the kitchen . " But , most tediously the Pioneer Press was n't in the kitchen and it was n't in any of the three kitchen pantries . Furthermore , it could n't be found in the dining room or the parlor , or any of the family 's five bedrooms . " Are Mary Egan and Jane Munson at home ? " roared my father at the foot of the stairs . " They 've probably burned it , " he added with bitterness . He was not a patient person and , like almost everyone else in the world , his patience was peculiarly , acutely tried  --  stretched to the breaking point  --  when he had made up his mind instantly to read something  --  anything  --  that turned out to be mislaid , or burned , or purloined . Ask those girls what they did with it , " he shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nurse , and who now was the waitress , and Jane Munson . who had long been our cook , were at home . As a rule they went to a dance every night except Sunday , swathed respectively in uncountable yards of blue andpink tarlatan and asphyxiatingly calcimined with a delirious mauve liquid that came in a bottle labelled " Laird 's Bloom of Youth . " But of the Pioneer Press Mary and Jane , who were in their room , repairing the havoc wrought by the feet of firemen at the dance of the night before , knew nothing . They could n't have burned it , they pointed out , as the kitchen stove had been functioning for hours before my father came downstairs and as usual read the thing at breakfast , and the library fire had been laid for several days without being lighted . " But I want it , " my father insisted . " I want to read something in it some-thing of importance . If it has n't been destroyed it must be in the house . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left it and strolled out of the front door . " " I ca n't imagine , " began my mother . " I ca n't imagine , " she repeated in a moment , but in a tone of noticeably less conviction . And then she very suddenly sat down in the rocking chair and by turning her back and frantically poking the fire which did n't need poking , tried to conceal the fact that she had become feeble with laughter . But naturally my father caught her at it and , with the elaborate and glacial politeness that is ever the signal of suppressed rage , he said , " Really , my dear , I ca n't quite see what is so excruciating in the fact that I am being extremely annoyed . " " It 's because  --  it 's because it has all at once come over me that I know where it is , " mother finally managed to gasp . She had given up and broken down completely . You know where it is ? " father thundered . " Then why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me where it is and let me get it . " " Oh , no  --  no , " mother protested with something that was a cross between a sob and a moan . " You could n't possibly get it . You could n't . " " If it would n't be too much trouble , will you kindly explain why not ? " father then acidly inquired . " You could n't get it  --  you could n't get it , becauoc mother  --  is wearing ? it , " she then heroically brought out . " Your mother , Mrs. McClure , is wearing a newspaper ? How on earth can a woman wear a newspaper ? Where is she wearing it ? " father , in angry amazement , demanded . " Oh , do n't  --  do n't , " mother pleaded . " I ca n't in so many words tell you where she wears them , but with your legal brain , " she wildly added , " I think you ought to be able to make a more or less accurate deduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClure uses the Pioneer Press for a bustle ? " father hissed . " Oh , my God , " he muttered as he clutched the arms of his chair and rolled his eyes . " Why , why , with the whole world filled to overflowing  --  teeming -- positively bursting with potential bustle material , does she deliberately , wilfully , perversely choose the Pioneer Press  --  my Pioneer Press ? " " It 's more economical , " mother , having partly got control of herself , tried to explain . " And then , too , she 's afraid of the wire ones  --  she does n't trust them . After they 've been worn a long time they have been known to collapse and run into people 's  --  and run into people . A Pioneer Press folded over a piece of tape and tied around the waist is perfectly safe . Sometimes , of course , it does get loose and fall off in the street , but she just kicks it aside and walks on pretending it was n't hers . " " But I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wailed . " I realize , naturally , that I ca n't get it myself , " he admitted with an attempt at sweet reasonableness , " but you can . " " But I wo n't , " replied mother with spirit and decision . " I absolutely refuse to ask her to undress at eight o'clock in the evening merely because you have an uncontrollable desire  --  an uncontrollable desire to read her bustle . I think it 's indecent . " More nearly like what is known as a " scene " than anything my parents had ? before me at least  --  ever indulged in , the atmosphere of the library for the next few moments was nervous , disconcerting , slightly poisonous . Father spasmodically drummed on the arms of his chair with his fingers , and in a kind of atavistic French fashion nervously shrugged and made faces . Mother violently rocked and , from time to time , once more overcome , leaned far forward and poked the fire . " Well , anyhow , she does go to bed at ten o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually , " mother agreed , but with considerably less optimism . " You can get it then , ca n't you ? " he asked . " Oh , yes , I can get it then . I 'll slip into her room , but after she 's asleep of course . It would upset her dreadfully if she knew . " That evening , however , " then , " for some unaccountable reason appeared to have determined never to arrive . It tarried , lingered , hesitated , changed its mind , got its second wind , and took a fresh hold . Nine o'clock struck , half past nine , and finally ten , at which father , bounding from his chair as if propelled by some hidden mechanism , began both ostentatiously and deafeningly , to lock up . He pulled down heavy windows with a perilous hang , smashed the inside shutters together till everyone jumped , opened the front door , slammed it shut again , and then went back and did it a second time . He then blew out the lamps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-room doorway , exclaimed to grandmother , with a kind of hollow heartiness ( she was now alone there ) , " Well  --  I do n't know what you 're going to do , but I 'm going to bed . " " Are you ? " murmured grandmother with no interest whatever  --  not even glancing up from her purple scallops . " I should if I were you . You can put out these lights  --  I ca n't reach them - and I 'll go into the library . Finishing a piece of work like this always seems to excite me a little . " The hours from eight to ten had been merely so much time  --  a long time to be sure , but after all , just time . From ten to one A.M. however was pure , abstract , metaphysical , Einsteinian eternity with a kind of beginning perhaps , but with no predictable end . Father , after prolonged , undertoned , sepulchral urging , consented to undress but refused to lie down or , for more than a minute or two , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverings , a nightshirt , he drifted interminably back and forth in the upper hall , scared me almost into screams by now and then suddenly sitting on the edge of my bed just as I was falling asleep , and creaked up and down the front stairs and past the library door four different times . The first three of these expeditions were productive of a single , reiterated , cryptic , intensely bitter phrase . Thrusting his head into the twilight of mother 's room he would mutter , " Still sitting on it , " and then resume his restless promenade . Before his fourth descent , however , grandmother herself creaked up the stairs , went to her room , apparently found something she wanted and , just as we had begun to feel that she had come up for the night , creaked outand down again . This time when father returned from below he no longer reported " Still sitting on it , " but , " She 's begun on solitaire . " I seem to have fallen asleep about then , and sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued what remained of the Pioneer Press and provided a perfectly good substitute , but all the next day was a most dreadful day , for when cheerful , energetic , sparkling grandmother appeared at breakfast , she was another creature ? a changed woman . She scarcely spoke , sighed a great deal and , listlessly protesting that she was perfectly well , left the table after having sipped a quarter of a cup of tea . From the garden , where she went to do a littleweeding among the asters and dahlias , she , who had never in her life been tired , returned in less than half an hour in a state of complete exhaustion , and by noon she had thrown the household into an almost tearful panic by going upstairs and actually lying down . My mother and my aunt had whispered consultations behind locked doors . Two earnest , apprehensive communications were written to the family doctor , almost sent and then torn up , and from noon till eve our world was enveloped in a kind of solemn , melancholy hush . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been more so ) but , as I hovered in the background of grandmother 's bedroom , I seemed , from time to time , to detect in her voice a note of something almost like impatience  --  even of exasperation . For grandmother refused to admit a pain , an ache , a chill or a temperature of any kind and looked , as she always did , rosy , pretty , and extremely solid . And then , at last , I heard her say rather tremulously , " Yes , something did happen  --  a dreadful thing . It was bound to come sooner or later  --  I 've always known that of course  --  but I did n't think it could come overnight . It has , though . Rebecca , I 'm an old , old woman . " " But what utter nonsense , " mother protested . " People in perfect health simply do n't get old right off like that . What in the world makes you imagine you have ? " " I do n't exactly like to tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young really to understand ; but this morning while I was dressing I remembered that when I was making my bustle yesterday I had noticed under Household Hints ' a recipe for getting rid of mice in a pleasant , friendly way that they enjoy . Of course there are n't any mice , but you never can tell , and I meant to cut it out , and then , when I unfolded my bustle and began to look , it was n't the Pioneer Press at all . It was last night 's Dispatch . " " Yes , yes , but what of it ? " mother urged her on . " I knew you could n't understand , " grandmother sighed . " What happened was that I must have got up during the night , gone all the way downstairs , found the Dispatch and made a new bustle ; but the awful part of it is that I have no recollection of doing anything of the kind . From the time I went to bed my mind was a perfect blank . I must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere because I have n't been able to find it , but I can'tremember even that . Rebecca , I am breaking up . " It was gay , I remembered , to see grandmother a moment or two later suddenly snap back from a self-imposed senility to a youthful middle-age  --  not unlike being present when a locust leaves its shell on a fence , or a butterfly pops out of a cocoon . And I remembered , too , that the next day mother subscribed to the Butler Pennsylvania Clarion Herald , which nobody in the family ever by any chance wanted to read , and which grandmother wore undisturbed to the last .
