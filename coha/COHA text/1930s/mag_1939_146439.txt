Of the four morning and four afternoon newspapers published in Manhattan all but two are conservative : the morning , tabloid Daily News and the evening Post . Last week , after six up-and-down years under Philadelphia Publisher J. David Stern ( TIME , June 26 ) , the Post got a new owner : the American Labor Party 's City Councilman George Backer , whose liberalism is more profound than J. David Stern 's and whose financial resources are greater . Young ( 36 ) Publisher Backer 's first acts were to pay back , with interest , the 10% of their salaries the Post 's staff members had been contributing to the paper since last September and to hire Cartoonist Rollin Kirby , who was dropped by the World-Telegram in March after he had shown himself too pronounced a liberal for the Scrippsless Scripps-Howard newspaper . <P> Manhattan 's liberal News was 20 years old this week . In contrast to its anemic colleague , it is the most successful newspaper ever established in the U. S. The News has a daily circulation of 1,848,320 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan 's morning papers put together , the largest daily circulation in the land and third largest in the world ( the London Daily Express has 2,466,323 , the Herald over 2,000,000 ) . The Sunday News sells 3,464,290 copies , a bare 300,000 less than London 's record-holding News of the world. * The News employs 3,500 people , pays them $8,000,000 a year . Its annual profit is usually estimated at around $5,000,000 . Its fabulous success is due almost entirely to Publisher Joseph Medill Patterson 's unique and highly individualistic application of a saying of Abraham Lincoln 's , the last six words of which are chiseled across the front of the $10,700,000 News building : " God must have loved the common people because HE MADE SO MANY OF THEM . " <P> Up From the Manure Pile . The News 's touch with the common people is no accident , but the result of self-conscious effort on the part of its publisher , who is famed for his rough- &-ready; dress , his brusque manners and his liking for rubbing shoulders with the proletariat in saloons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never got along with other rich boys , had made several sporadic efforts to become a man of the people before he found his chance as a publisher . From 1914 until 1925 he and his cousin , Robert Rutherford McCormick , shared the running of the Chicago Tribune ( which their grandfather , Joseph Medill , had founded ) , and Patterson was as much responsible for the common touch in its news coverage as McCormick was for its conservative editorial bias . The two conceptions did not quite jell in the Tribune and Joe Patterson did not get along with his Cousin Bertie much better than he had with other rich boys . During the War they agreed that the Tribune was too small for them both . The decision to start the News , according to Colonel McCormick 's recollection , was reached on a manure pile in France . <P> Joe Patterson had talked to Lord Northcliffe , whose London Daily Mirror , a half-size picture paper , was selling nearly 1,000,000 copies daily . Northcliffe suggested that he try out the tabloid idea in the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they dined with some other officers , then stepped outside and seated themselves on the dung heap .
