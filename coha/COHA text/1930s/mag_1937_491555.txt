EVEN being expelled from the conservatory had not so much effect on me . Outside things did not influence me greatly . I said to myself : " It is very unpleasant , because my father , poor man , will be sorry . " But even then I had a faith , an inner security about the future that nothing could destroy . But my expulsion did affect the Kerntopf family terribly . They looked upon that as a disgrace . There were many of them , and all looked upon me as some kind of malefactor . " He has been expelled from the consereatoire , " they whispered . This hurt me . But the eldest brother , Edward , always defended me . He then said , " You are stupid ; you do not know what you are talking about ! It is not a disgrace ; it is an honor , really , for him , that he has been expelled for such a stupid thing ! " And I am glad to say that it was looked upon in exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They made some protest to the directors , especially my teacher of harmony and counterpoint , who said : " I protest strongly against all this . It was not right to force that boy to attend rehearsals when he had examinations to do . It is unjust ; he should be taken back . " This protest made a great impression , for a message was sent immediately to Edward Kerntopf , which said , " Bring Paderewski back . We will pardon his offense and receive him again in his class . " So Kerntopf came to me , overjoyed . " Ah , now I have good news for you he cried . " You are going back to the conservatory . They realize their mistake ; you are to return . " " But , " I answered , " it is impossible . I was expelled . " " Oh , never mind that , " he answered . " I just received word from the director himself that you are to be received again . They will welcome you . " And so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director with the piercing eyes . He sat at a table , surrounded by his professors . He looked keenly at me and said , " Well , Paderewski , you have behaved very badly . " " But , " I exclaimed , " I did not behave badly ; I was just defending my rights ! " The director again bent his searching gaze upon me and continued as though I had not spoken : " But as you have appeared here and performed this act of humility to us , you are forgiven , and you may now continue your examinations . " Well , it was all so surprising and unexpected that I really could not say anything . But in my heart I was glad , and Edward Kerntopf was happy . Lightning Strikes Twice D I.RECTLY from there I went to the class where examinations took place , and all the troubles were over , it seemed . Then the orchestra concerts started . But some newspapers suddenly began attacking that poor director , because they knew what had happened  --  that pupils were forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsals  --  and although their orchestra was a groat success then , public sentiment was against it . The press took this up and continued their attacks until they became so violent that several of the pupils answered , and even sent a protest. , I was the one boy who was originally looked upon as the leader of the opposition , so they used my name in this protest , without my knowledge , and it was published . So / was again drawn into the conflict and expelled for the second time ! This time I left the conservatory for a year . I was still living with the Kerntopf family . Then I went to a. certain professor , the best teacher of piano in the conservatory , for private lessons . It was all I could do . But I had only three or four lessons with him . Of course , he was a very good technician , but he had absolutely no poetry in him , no emotion . I prepared what he told me to prepare , but it was very deficient . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , after two years at the conservatory . He was accustomed to correct playing . He did not pay attention to playing that was , perhaps , poetic , but technically incorrect . So , of ter the fourth lesson , he said , " Now I 'll give you some good advice . Do not try to play the piano , because you will never be a pianist . Never . " And he refused to give me any more private lessons . Ah ! That was very discouraging . For the moment , I did not know what to do . So I played by myself , and got on somehow . But , of course , I-did not yet know how to play . It took me half my life to realize that there are two ways of using the piano . The one is to play , the other is to work ! If you use the one , you will never achieve anything . You are carried away with your own emotion and with the emotion of the contents of the work you are playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in playing without learning anything ! You can be drunk in any art on your own emotion . And , alas ! a great many people are wasting their time that way ; arriving at no results at all . While working , of course , you suffer , because you have absolutely no pleasure , only eftort and pain . I began to realize the truth of Goethe 's great say-jog , " Whoever does not eat his bread in tears , does not know what work means . " You see , all this time I was playing , not working . I only began really working ten years later , and still , to this moment , I have to fight that inclination to play , because it is so tedious to work . So I played myself , and prepared a certain repertoire . I thought I might , perhaps , give a few concerts . I had that idea . I had already something of a program  --  Chopin , a few pieces , and Liszt , and so it was that with two companions I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then sixteen . It was , I think , the idea of adventure that really started ik us off on this perilous trip  --  adventure  --  yes , and money . I wanted to earn some money . I think it was , in the beginning , the suggestion of the violinist , because he hoped in that way to see his family , who were living in the north of Poland , and he thought  --  and , I suppose , we all did  --  that he , at any rate , would cover himself with laurels and make a great effect on his family . We started , three pupils of the conservaloire . The ' cellist , who was the oldest of all  --  he was about twenty-two  --  was a very well-balanced musician and a very intelligent fellow . His name was Biernacki . My other colleague was just a lively young fellow , two years older than myself , who played the violin rather well . His name was Cielewics . We got a permit from the canservaloire , where we were all pupils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also add that our parents knew nothing about this great adventure . Musical Gypsying A ND so we started off , at first very modestly , with the intention of playing concerts only in the summer resorts and watering places . We had a very nice little success  --  we even made a little money  --  but the ' cellist  --  he was a very serious man  --  decided to return to the ccmservainire . He had had enough . Our adventure did not appeal to him at all . The ' cellist said : " No , I do not believe in the success of the next concert . I am not so adventurous as you are ; I shall leave . " So he went home , and we pressed on farther , but the farther we went , the worse it went too . The ' cellist was right . It was very childish . We met with the greatest difficulties , but just when we were in the blackest despair , quite of a sudden would come a little success , which was most unfortunate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed a little farther . Yes , these occasional successes proved very disastrous in the end , as you will see . Our greatest difficulty always was to find a piano , and very rarely could we find a grand piano anywhere . A small square piano , usually hoarse and of terrible tone , and seemingly one hundred years old , was the best we could generally find . Naturally , our first necessity in arriving in a town was to And out who were the musical people of the place , and we immediately paid visits to them . At this distance , it all seems very childish . We would present ourselves in some trepidation and ask to be permitted to have the use of their piano , if they had one , for our concert that night . You can imagine , in many cases , the surprise which greeted our request , but almost everywhere permission was given , and the people , consequently , became interested in our concert in advance . It was really not such a bad way of advertising ourselves , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great necessity . Well , after the permission to use the piano in question was granted , then the terrible thing was to carry the piano from the house to the hall where we were to play . Ah I That was an agony ! It created a great sensation in the town , and great controversy , too , because nobody knew how to manage it .. To move a piano , like everything else , requires some knowledge ; it is not so simple its you might think , Everyune had a different idea , and we would have to go practically all over the town to gather together people who would listen to diseipline , and generally there were none . I was the disciplinarian , and my struggles I can remember , even to this day , were almost superhuman . And added to our difficulties was , of course , the great anxiety on the part of the owner of the piano , lest it should be utterly ruined and smashed in transit . Our entire concert day was generally spent in getting and then moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and it made no difference . The only easy times , I recall , were when we came to a place that was a military post , and then the soldiers took a hand . They entered into the spirit of it and were delighted to move the piano for us . But always , first of all , one of them would try to lift it , and when he found it so terribly heavy , he would begin a great argument that not even four or five men could carry it to the hall . Often they would get into quarrels about how many were needed , and sometimes it ended in thirty or forty , or even fifty soldiers coming to carry the piano , and , of course , they could not do it without shouting and swearing , which , too , proved another advertisement for us . Imagine ! Crisis in Russia yV HEN it was finally landed in the hall , I under- stood how to unwind the piano and put the legs back again , which was , naturally , an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God save the mark , as you say , because that , too , was my duty . I had an old piano key which served a little , but , I most say , a very little . Later on , it was our good luck that a man joined our troupe who proved to be a traveling piano tuner . The right man for us ! It was a great relief to me , because I had really no knowledge of piano tuning . We paid the soldiers , of course , very modestly , for we had so little money , but the principal reward was a little drink of vodka , which we offered them after the job was done . Not many of them , I regret to say , came to the concert . Their interest in us ceased with the moving of the piano . We came to a large place where there was a Russian fortress . We gave a concert . It was not a success . We had no plan where to go from there , and while thinking about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more cautious than I , because , when leaving home , he had taken with him a little package of tea and sugar . So , with our last few pence we bought a big loaf of bread , and we lived on that tea and bread for about ten days . That saved us . The landlord , an elderly man who was coughing almost continuously , began to feel anxious about the money due for the room . He asked when we could pay , and we did not know , but soon , we hoped . My father 's house was hundreds of miles away , and my companion 's parents were living perhaps one hundred miles away ; they to the east and my family to the south . I was very proud then , and did not want to write to my father and ask for help , but the violinist wrote to his people , and at the end an envelope came which brought him some money . After we received the money and could pay what we owed at that hotel , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat for days but that bread , which was like hard wood , and we had to soak it in the tea to make it eatable . The landlord was very pleased , too , and we became friends . " Well , my young friends , " he said , " I understand that you are musicians . I did not hear you play " ? he turned to me ? " but I heard you fiddling  --  you there , " he said , pointing to the violinist . " But , you know , for me that is not music ; all that instrumental music , be it piano or violin , it is really nothing ! Nothing ! " he shouted . " Piano you play with just the fingers , you know . When you are fiddling , you are playing only on animal 's intestines ! That is all the strings are . It 's not music . " I timidly asked him which kind of music he considered big enough for his tastes . " Why , wind instruments ! " he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments are played with the chest ! " He was very serious . " A man plays with his chest in the wind instruments , with all his strength , with all his power , and that is something to listen to ! " It took me some time to understand this point of view . But finally I thought it all out . That poor man was coughing all the time , coughing his life away . He was suffering constantly from asthma , and for him the ideal thing was to be able to play with his chest  --  with his breath , for he had n't Well , that tour lasted for some months . We had started on our journey in the summer , with only summer clothing ; we had no overcoats and no furs , and it was a very severe winter . We could not buy clothes , scarcely food . But , you know , there was one very excellent way of protecting ourselves . The frost was very severe . I could not tell you how muola it was below zero ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more . Very remarkable that we survived at all . We covered ourselves up under our vests with newspapers  --  the best protection , and the only one we had . We did not feel the cold at all then . But sometimes we saw very sad proofs of the rigor of that climate . In the north of Russia we saw several soldiers working along the road . When we approached them they were standing very still , not moving ; they were all frozen , six or seven 68 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January J0.1937 of them  --  frozen to death as they worked . A most terrible picture . Just standing there frozen to the earth . There was one incident during this time that was really very dramatic . I think I must tell you about it . We arrived at the shore of a river . There was DO approach there and we could not cross the river . The last ferry , which was the only means of communication between one shore and the other , had already left , so we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began suddenly to feel very sick . I had a high fever , was simply burning up and very thirsty . There was no village there : only the cabin of the ferryman . Across the river was the military colony , with soldiers ' barracks . There were in Russia at that time still a large number of those military colonies . Enormous areas covered with barracks and inhabited by several regiments , with their families . And it was our intention to go there to give a concert . There was only the cabin of the guardsman of the ferry . So we asked him whether he had something to eat or drink . He had nothing but tea , he said . So we begged for tea . I was simply burning ! Not only that but I felt such heat over my face ; I could hardly touch my face because it was so sore . I thought it was my end , because I had such a dreadful fever . But my one idea was that if we ever reached that opposite side , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not slept one minute , always repeating to myself , " Caviar , caviar ; let me have caviar ! " Finally the ferry came , and we crossed to Miedvied , which means , in Russian , " a bear , " and which was the name of the colony . When we arrived at the hotel , the proprietor looked at me , astonished . He said , " You are not well , sir . You 're sick . " I was alarmed at this , and said quickly , " Yes , I am well , quite , but very hungry , and I am going to eat plenty of caviar . That 's what I want , " The Caviar Cure " Caviar ! " he exclaimed . " Oh , but you are sick ; you are red ! You have a fever . " But I insisted , and ordered caviar and started eating it in my room , and I ate at least two pounds of caviar . Then I took tea to satisfy my burning thirst , and then I slept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted more . Fresh caviar it was , and it was delicious ! But then I looked at myself in the glass , and I was horrified ; I was just scarlet . I did not dare to go out of the hotel . I saw a doctor at once . He examined my pulse . " Your pulse is regular , but all you say proves that either you have measles , which is dangerous , or you have scarlet fever , which may be still more dangerous . If you pull through , it will be a miracle . " He gave me some powder for my face which seemed to relieve me , and the pain gradually subsided after my orgy of caviar . Evidently , it was the caviar and not the doctor that cured me . And I did pull through , as you see ; though I still do n't know what could have been the matter with me. 1 had some little money sent me by my father . By this time he knew of this adventure ; I 'd written him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sent me one hundred rubles , with the idea that I should return home at once , The parents of the violinist also told him to return , and ho obeyed and left immediately . We parted ; I going to St. Petersburg , from where I planned to proceed directly to my father 's house . When I arrived in St. Petersburg , I met a young man I had seen in the Kerntopf family . I was very pleased to see him , for , I suppose , I was a little homesick , and he seemed delighted to see me . He inquired eagerly about my doings , and so ou . " Well , " he said , " where are you going now ? What are you intending to do next ? " " Oh , " I said , " I am happy to tell you that I am now returning home . I am leaving directly , because my father has just sent me the money for the journey . " I was so overjoyed at that that . I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the money , for lie immediately borrowed from me all that money , telling me that he only needed it for a few hours and would bring it back directly . Well , as you have already guessed , the few hours were forever . He left immediately for Warsaw with my money , and left me penniless in St. Petersburg . He went to his home with the money that was sent me to go to mine . A Good Samaritan To pile up the agony still further , my luggage and all my possessions were still at the station , where I had met him , because I had planned , you see , to leave St. Petersburg that very day . But when I asked for my luggage , it had been stolen . And I was then left with nothing , literally . I had noticed , when talking with my supposed friend , that there was someone with him  --  a man who did not seem particularly friendly , I thought , and who had a suspicious attitude . Soon after I was left stranded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he had been keeping an eye on me . I think that must have been so , because he proved to be my guardian angel at that moment . . He approached me and said , " What happened between you and that fellow from Warsaw ? What did he say ? Tell me . " " Oh , " I answered , " he borrowed money from me . " " And you gave him money ? That is a pity  --  a great pity  --  for he is a rascal ! " " Oh , " I interrupted , " but I met him in the house of friends in Warsaw , and I believed in him . " The man laughed angrily and said , " You will never see your money again  --  never ! He owes me money too . He got it in the same way . He is a rascal , " he repented . " A bad fellow . " " What shall I do ? " I exclaimed . " I am penniless ! I can not write my father again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " he answered , after a moment , " come to me . I am a very poor man , but I can give you at least a roof to sleep under and a bit of bread to eat . " He was a plumber and he was very , very poor . All he could offer me was tea and bread , and a little corner in his poor room . But I was thankful for it . I spent there , I think , about a fortnight , and I did not know what to do . I had , twice a day , tea , and bread . I walked the streets , absolutely helpless . How it happened I do not know , but after a fortnight , the janitor of that house came to me and said , " Have you any relative ? " " Yes , " I answered quickly . " Because there is a , letter for you , " he said . " Can it be from my father ? " I cried . " What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , that 's right . But the address was wrong , so we have sent from the post office all over the city to find you . " It was a special letter  --  what you call registered . My father had sent me one hundred rubles . That was simply a miracle . I gave , at once , a little to the poor fellow who had kept me alive on bread and tea those weeks , and then I went home . Oh , so thankful ! I reached home safely , and there was great rejoicing in our family . It seemed as if I had been gone a century . After a time , when I was alone with my father , I asked him what impulse had prompted him to send me that money the second time . " Oh , that is easily explained , " he answered . " I had a dream . I saw you in desperate position in St. Petersburg , and I immediately sent , asking the post office to inquire for you : " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was underground . There was no light , and I could not even read . I could do nothing , absolutely nothing ! So I walked the whole day long . And it was then for the first time that I saw Rubinstein going in a cab through the streets . I knew who it was , because I had seen his photographs . If I could have only realized at that moment that not so very much later I was again to see and talk with Rubinstein , and even have him play one of my compositions , perhaps my days would not have seemed so desperate , but such a thing never entered my mind , because I was a poor wretch . That was one of the most crucial moments of my life . You know , at this time I really had no idea what to do ; I was completely crushed . I was left like a dead leaf . Many a time I think about that ; first of all with infinite gratitude to my dear father , and then to God , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , was my destiny ; it was the hand of God . My father did not make one single reproach when I got back ; just showed joy to see me again . A Triumph in Warsaw My heart was filled with gratitude  --  unspeakable gratitude . And I vowed then to give my father a. great happiness , I said to him , " Now I am going to give you a supreme satisfaction . I gave you so much trouble , I shall now finish my studies at the con , vervalaire and receive my diploma . " " But , " he said , " you will have to stay for such a long time . I-low can you ? " ? " Well , " I replied , " it can not be helped now . I must finish my course and get a diploma . Yon will see . " So I went back to the conservatory and worked very hard , especially on theory and counterpoint and composition , and I worked so hard that in six months I finished my studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had enormous concentration . They did not make any difficulties in taking me back again ; they were glad enough to have me . Then came the finishing act of the school year , and my father came for that . And he was standing in that big hall , the Municipal Hall in Warsaw  --  I see him still  --  and he was really frightened . I had had so much trouble there , you see . Poor man , he wondered what was going to happen next . " Is something wrong again ? " he thought . But I received that diploma , and he was simply amazed , overwhelmed with joy ! And that director read my name in a loud voice . And then I played . How I did , I do not know , as I was deeply moved myself by this great event . A step forward at last ! I played the Grieg Concerto with the orchestra . I remember that . And so it was ; thus came to an end my studies in the conservatory at Warsaw . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preferably ? to study piano . But , alas , I had not the means . My father had done all he could . I must remain in Warsaw . I accepted the post of teacher in the conservatory there . And now we come to a great event in my life . I think I shall have to say it very simply ; I fell in love . I was only twenty , and in spite of the uncertainty of the future , I married . I wanted a home , a personal life of my own  --  a place and someone that belonged to me . I married , in 1880 , . Antonin Korsak  --  a young girl who was a student at the conservatory . I was happy , but it was a short happiness . A year later my wife died , leaving me alone with our child , a son . I had lived through a brief , a beautiful experience . Even at twenty , one can plumb the heights and depths and know the pain and mystery of life . I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go forward alone . My wife had had some little money of her own , and before her death she asked me to use part of it to continue my musical studies , in which she had the deepest faith . We had in Poland an institution , a very special kind of trusteeship , controlled by a number of prominent people , the details of which are of no interest at this moment , except that it was in that institution that I deposited the money that was to go to my child . It proved to be a tragic choice , for every penny of it was lost a few years later by those very respectable trustees . The little safety I had hoped for proved a dream , like so many other dreams . Violin Detour I realized very keenly that there was no future for me there in Warsaw , except as a teacher , and so I determined to go to Berlin . I left my child with his grandmother , and went directly to Friedrich Kiel , a marvelous roan and the greatest teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I began myself at last almost to believe it  --  that I could never be a pianist , but that I was very talented in composition . I had already written a few pieces , which had been printed in Warsaw and made quite a little success . You asked me whether I ever studied the violin , among the many instruments that I studied . Yes , and that is rather an amusing story , because in those early days , whenever I began my studies , I found myself always learning some instrument other than the piano . And so it happened when I went to Kiel , and he suggested it . He told me that it was absolutely necessary to know the character and possibilities of a string instrument , and the violin would be the most practical for me . I had absolutely no knowledge of the first elements of violin playing , so I had a very mediocre teacher  --  all I could afford . But I met again with the same discouragement there as with the flute , the oboe and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally , disgusted , he said that I had absolutely no talent for music  --  none . He did not know that I was a musician , but thought of mo as a foreigner who wanted to learn a little scratching on the violin , and did not hesitate to discourage me after a few lessons . He said , " Oh , why do you study the violin ? You will never be a violinist. ? never . You are not a musician ; you have not even a good ear for music . You should stop the lessons now . It 's a waste of money . " Well , I decided to have a little revenge . The day after this tirade , at my last lesson , I took him into my room , where the little piano was , and I began to play for him . He stared at me , dumfounded . The poor fellow was perfectly petrified . I played one of my latest compositions , and then began a Chopin Mazurka , but before I could even finish it. , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop 1 " he cried . " Stop ! I have made a fool of myself ! A perfect fool ! " He was pathetic in his embarrassment . I confess that I enjoyed my little revenge , but I was sorry , too , for after that impromptu concert of mine , the poor fellow said he would not come again , there was nothing he could do for me ; and that was the end of my violin lessons . A Lesson Strauss Taught Me Anyhow , with those few lessons of violin and ' cello , I acquired much that has been of great value to me all my life . I found , when making the score of my opera and other works where the orchestra is an important part , that I could play myself , very slowly , it is true , but accurately and understandingly , anything that I wrote for the violin and ' cello . At that time , you know , in spite of my- unfaltering inner conviction of destiny , I was strongly under the influence of my teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be , a successful pianist . That , of course , left its impression . As I was very fond of composing , and some of my first compositions were rather noteworthy in that little circle of friends , I almost lost , myself , any hope of becoming a successful pianist . So , naturally , I turned then to composition . I studied composition . I worked very hard  --  really too hard  --  and my nerves gave way . My health broke down completely . I used to work ten or twelve hours a day . I made , of course , very considerable progress , and Friedrich Kid told me many times that he had never had such a gifted pupil . But Kiel was also interested in my playing  --  he was one of the few  --  and whenever I played . a composition which I had prepared for him , he would say , " Oh , you must practice your piano more , because you also have a remarkable talent for piano playing . " He was not like the conservatory teacher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Look here ; you must devote more time to the trombone , because , believe me , the trombone is your future livelihood . With the piano you will never do anything . " It was while I was studying in Berlin that I began to meet some famous musicians who were very helpful to me . I met Richard Strauss at the house of my publisher , Hugo Bock . It was a very amusing household , including several charming children , for whom I used to play , and the children liked me very much , consequently . Sometimes we came in the evening , Strauss and myself and some other musicians , and just to amuse the children , we played for them , he and I , dance music . On some occasions the 70 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST Joncus ? -y 50,1057 company was composed not only of children but of adults , too , and the atmosphere was so gay , so intimate that everyone wanted to dance . Strauss playing was not very brilliant . He was chiefly a composer all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was always very fond of dance music . He adored it and it was delightful to listen to him . But there was one great drawback to the enjoyment of his playing , and that was also a factor which determined me to study the expression of my face when playing  --  namely , the awful grimaces Strauss made while at the piano . It was too amusing for words to see , but it was also rather painful . It was really a show in itself  --  an additional performance . I was guilty , too , and was sometimes ridiculed by my colleagues . I had , as a student , to postpone overcoming that , because I never practiced long enough to watch myself . But when I arrived in Berlin , and particularly after seeing Strauss at the piano , I knew that it was a grave impediment in the career of an artist , and I then studied all my difficult passages with a mirror before me . I absolutely surmounted that difficulty , but only after months and months of watching myself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than twenty-two and it had become a fixed habit . I surmounted that difficulty to such an extent that I may say now , without any exaggeration , that I do not know whether there is any other pianist who can keep himself as quiet and as much master of his appearance while playing the most difficult music as I. So I have always been grateful to Strauss for making me realize the importance of overcoming this obnoxious habit . I am tapping now , in this little talk , a great reservoir of memories . Those days in Berlin were full of new experiences and contacts . Quite a new life opened its doors to me . I was moving forward , a few groping steps at a. time , toward the great world of art . Playing for Rubinstein I was introduced to Hugo Bock by a very fine man and good musician , Moritz Moszkowski , and it was through this introduction that my compositions were published , because it was extremely difficult , being young and unknown , to find a publisher . Bock gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the enormous sum of 200 marks , that is about fifty dollars . You know , I never really expected that ; he acted very generously under the circumstances . In Mr. Bock 's house , which was one of the important ones in Berlin , I met all the musical celebrities who were living in Berlin or passing through the German capital . Of course , Bock , as a publisher , knew them all . But first and foremost , I should like to mention something which influenced me in my determination to pursue that pianistic career . I was in the office of Bock one day with a new composition , when , just as I was leaving , he said to me quite suddenly , " Would you not like to meet Anton Rubinstein ? " I was amazed , naturally , at this ; it was quite unexpected . " Of course , " I said . " I should be delighted . I ? " " Well , " he interrupted , " please come then to my house for dinner tonight and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went and met that great , that immense artist . He was most agreeable and gracious , and after dinner he came to me and said , " I hear a great deal about your compositions from Mr. Bock , who speaks highly of them . Will you not play me some-thing ? " I had just finished a set of variations , which I played for him , and he was very pleased . He listened attentively . " You have a brilliant fututt , " he said . " Now play me something more , something else ; play some short pieces . " I did so , and again he was very complimentary , very kind . " You should compose more , " he went on , " more for the piano . " " Oh , " I protested . " I can not really do much for the piano , I play so little myself . " " Nonsense , " he replied . " You should play more , I tell you . You have an inborn technique and you could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did not know how to answer him ; it overwhelmed me . It was such a surprise . This experience with Rubinstein had a tremendous effect . What he said changed my world . Musical Giants In those early years I met and knew almost all the musical giants of the time . It was a glorious period  --  great composers , pianists and conductors . This was true in Warsaw as well as in Berlin . At the house of Louis Grossman , particularly , I had many opportunities of meeting all the artists who came to Warsaw . Grossman was a piano dealer , and a very good musician himself . I remember the first time Leopold Auer , famous violinist , came to Warsaw ; at that time he was at the climax of his career , enjoying enormous success everywhere . He played with the orchestra and his own recital , and then he promised to play at the conservatory . It was in 1878 , when I was just finishing my studies there . He had promised to play some new compositions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany him . It was difficult and quite modern music . The director called together all the professors and asked who could best accompany Auer . No one dared attempt it . So he sent for me , I was in my class , studying . " Paderewski , " he said , " you must help us out . You are going to accompany a great artist , Leopold Auer , this afternoon .. And take care , " he warned , " because lie 's a very great artist . He can not rehearse because he has no time , and you must play for him at sight . " Well , I did it . I had never seen that music before , but I read it quickly and it went well . I must confess that I was a little bit impressed , but at that time I did not mind technical difficulties , because I had no technique myself , and the correctness of piano playing was something absolutely unknown to me . So accompaniments presented no great difficulty . Auer was delighted , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must play for me again ; I do not want any other accompanist . " And so I accompanied him on his return . He remembered that even a few years ago , the year before he died , when he was a very old man ; in fact , I 'm told this little story is in his biography . He was the greatest teacher of the violin ever known . He was for the violin as great a master as Leschetizky for the piano . I did not mention , when speaking about the artists at the house of Grossman , that I met there an artist who became the first pianist to play my compositions , Madame Essipoff . She was interested in those variations in A Minor , and she played them for the first time in Vienna , and then she also played them in her own concerts . I met her later on , when I went to Leschetizky . She was very interested and helpful to me always . She was , incidentally , one of the many wives of Leschetizky . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and always with great delight ? " People call me Blue-beard , and yet , unlike Bluebeard , all my wives are alive ! ' ' I have had only four wives , and that is not so many when compared to Eugene d'Albert . D'Albert has had eight . That is surely a record number . " All of which reminds me that D'Albert was another musician whom I first met at Bock 's house in Berlin . He was a pupil of Liszt . He played in Berlin and made a sensation . He was quite a boy still  --  about eighteen years of age , three years younger than I. He made a tremendous impression upon me . He played beautifully , with such dash and temperament  --  a little fellow , very small in stature , not much to look at at the piano . His playing was remarkable , at that time , technically and in expression ; but there was something unpleasant in his technique , too many mannerisms . It was not reposeful playing . It was much more pleasant to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good Beethoven player . As a natural gift for piano playing , his was an absolutely remarkable talent . I have not seen D'Albert for thirty years or more . I lost sight of him . Then suddenly , about three years ago , there came from Evian a letter from one of his daughters , enclosing a note of introduction from him for his two daughters , who wanted very much to meet me . Of course , I wrote at once and asked them to come , and they came to tea on a Sunday . It was just before my severe illness , when I was many years younger than I am now . When I came into the room to greet them , they seemed a little embarrassed  --  in fact , they looked at me in surprise . I noticed it , and said at once , " What is the matter ? What disturbs you ? " An Unfortunate Joke They hesitated for a moment , and then one said quite seriously , " Well , you see , you surprised us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than our father . " " I am , " I replied . " I am . " " But , " she continued , " how is that ? My father looks so much older . " Then I laughed and said , " That is very easily explained . You see , it is because I have not been married as many times as your father . " Well , that was an awful moment , for they , it seems , were the children of his fourth wife . They were not at all pleased with my answer . It was a very unfortunate joke . We have again gone far afield with these memories . I stayed in Berlin throughout the year , studying , and then returned to Warsaw for my vacation  --  a greatly needed vacation . I found , upon my return to Warsaw , that almost everybody laughed at my intention of going on with my studies . They all said , " Why ? You have studied enough ; you do not need to study any more . " " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study , even composition " ? though I had already made quite a serious work of that . THE SATURDAY ( Continued from Page 70 ) " No , you know enough already , " they argued . " Stay here ; we need you . The superior class of piano is offered you . Stay here in Warsaw . " I listened to them . My funds were very low ; so I was obliged to start again as piano teacher . The same old story ! But it was wrong  --  completely , as I soon found out .. It seems , I was a very good teacher , but I do not like it . I prefer to give ten concerts rather than one lesson . It takes much more of my energy , I assure you . It is a very exhausting profession . Because I realized that my general education was lacking a great deal , I started , then , a course of studies at college . I was teaching in the daytime , earning my living , and in the evening from eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I studied Latin , German , Russian , mathematics , Greek history . I had four teachers coming every day . It was expensive and I had to give many extra lessons to pay their fees . Sometimes I gave as many as nine or ten piano lessons a day . And I really acquired some serious knowledge . Certain things have been , perhaps , useless , but a great deal was very necessary . Knowledge is the only thing that can enrich but can not be taken from one . It was while I was teaching that I met , by chance , the editor of a popular daily newspaper . We had rather a long talk together . Then , quite suddenly , he said , " Why don't. you write some articles about music  --  some criticisms , and so on ? And I will print them . " Itdid not temptmeverymuch . I told him that if I had time , I should like to write a few articles , because it would be useful , but I had not the leisure then . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his paper a criticism which made me perfectly wild . It was a severe , unjustified and violent attack upon a fine artist . who had made a great impression on me . It was written by somebody who , first of all , did not know anything about music , and also because he was displeased with the applause and a little ovation that was given to the artist . It was personal spite on his part . Now , there is a great deal of that incomprehensible envy . Why ? I have never been able to understand why . I can understand perfectly well that musicians who are not successful envy their colleagues more fortunate than themselves . Yes . I understand that same feeling among literary men , painters , sculptors , and so on , but I can not understand , for instance , how a clerk can bitterly envy an actor or a musician . But that happens . And not only those in an inferior position . I have seen people occupying very high places in society , enjoying the possession of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting into a protest on account of the success that a singer , for instance , enjoys . I never could understand that . Therefore , when I read that criticism I went directly to the newspaper and asked for the editor . I was in a great state of excitement . " Now , " I said , " I am ready . I am going to write for your newspaper . I have decided . " I was fired with a holy indignation . The editor realized at once that I was in a fighting mood , and still he wanted me . " I am delighted , " he cried , " for I still want you and will give you a free hand . You can write what you like . " I think I can say this much for my articles  --  that never in any other paper in the world have there been , before or since , so many friendly , well-wishing EVENING POST and encouraging criticisms as I was writing for that paper . Everybody was praised  --  everybody ! That was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as violent in my way of feeling as they were in theirs . I had become bitter in a just cause . There is a very charming and appropriate aphorism that I think I may quote here : During this period I lived in the Aclamowski family , who were my beloved friends , and still are  --  those that are left . You see , I left the Kerntopf household after I finished my studies at the conservatory . As long as I was a student , it was quite all right to live in that crowd of children , and the family life was very comfortable and pleasant , but when I grew up and became a teacher myself , I had to have an entirely different way of living . It was a necessity . A little drawing room where I could teach , and a bedroom , and so on . Well , my life went on . I taught , I studied , I wrote . Incessant work . The results at that time seemed rather meager to me . I was still seeking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me , and after a year of that pedagogical work , I realized , absolutely , that there was something in me as a pianist . I was determined then upon a pianistic career , but I realized that , first of all , I must go away and finish my studies in composition , which had been interrupted . So I returned to Berlin . This time I studied with Professor Urban , a pupil of Kiel and a very special teacher of orchestration . But that knowledge of orchestration was already in me , so to speak , on account of having studied and played so many instruments . Although this is not exactly in sequence , I have just now thought of an experience  --  a very amusing one . I think it must be included somewhere in these first chapters , so here it is : I was to play in a concert with a violinist of some importance . He was a professor at the conservatory . He asked me to go on a short tour with him . We went to a small watering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we have plenty of those watering places in my country , and some of them are extremely good , worthy of any Vichy or Spa or Aix-les-Bains , but they lack development and advertisement . We found , on arrival , that there was no piano to be had , except a very old instrument , the hammers of which were in a pitiable condition . They would resound to the touch by lifting January 30,7937 easily , but , alas , they would not fall down again ; they remained immovable in the air . It is impossible to describe the agony of this . I found I could not play at all . What was to be done with these immovable hammers hanging in the air and the tone still sounding ? - They would go up , but never , never down ! I felt that , perhaps , I could manage the accompaniments , and the violin would somehow carry us through . But my solo pieces , what was I to do about them ? Well , I worked over the hammers , trying everything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they flew and there they stayed ! " This is horrible , " I cried . " We must do something . I can never , never play even one piece on this piano . " It was a dreadful moment . I was in a frenzy . There was with us ' a young student who had come along on the tour just for fun . Eager to help , he said , " Wait . I have a plan , an idea . " " How ? " we both shouted . " How ? It 's impossible ! " When you begin to play , I will push the hammers down as quickly as they go up . I can easily do that , and I do n't think the audience will really notice ; I can do it so quickly . " It was certainly an ingenious idea and our last resort , so we agreed to it . The concert started , but with an incident  --  a very unusual one and very amusing . The prefect of the place decided to come . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very showy and dashing , and was attended by tall Cossacks . He declared that he would not only like to listen to the concert but he even would pay for his tickets , which was most magnanimous on his part . But he would not mingle with the public . He was far above that . So he continued , " I can only come on one condition , and that is that you open wide the windows and I , myself , any wife and all my children will listen to your concert , but from the outside . " So , after these arrangements were made , we began the concert , my friend standing close to the piano , pushing down the hammers as quickly as they flew up into the air . The accompaniments for the violinist were not so bad ; there were little chords , and so on , at first , and then some arpeggios , so our young helper had not to work so very hard , and , of course , not all the hammers were defective . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have seen him . His hands flew like birds from side to side . He had to loan way across the piano ; back and forth he weaved and darted in constant motion . I was simply playing , but he had to do all the work . It was a race between us , and try as he would , he could never quite keep up with me ; the piano came out victor . Some of the audience finally caught on , and then they got up in their seats to look . They could not understand what was happening . After the concert was over , I hurried out and mingled with the audience . I was not noticed as they gathered in groups , excitedly discussing the concert . " And how , " one asked , " did you like that young pianist ? " " Oh , very well . He was all right , but the other one  --  you know , the second pianist , who was playing at the back of the piano  --  he was the best , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was the real artist , make no mistake ! "
