Said Seattle 's Anesthetist Louis Herbert Maxson last week upon having a piece of dead bone removed from his foot without the use of anesthetic : " I 'll be a fine guinea pig . " Dr. Maxson had just discovered that he suffered from syringomyelia , incurable spinal abscess which renders limbs insensate and may require continuous amputations . Bleakly continued Dr. Maxson : " Well , it 's a slow disease . It may take 10 , 20 , 40 years to kill me . And I 'm 52 . So I 'm not bothering my head about it much . Anesthetists work sitting down . "
