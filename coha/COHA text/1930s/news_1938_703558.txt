Parliament recessed July 29 until Nov. 1 but has remained subject to immediate recall . The exact date for early reassembly will be fixed when parliamentary i leaders . learn when Mr. Chamberlain is returning from Berchtesgaden . BERCHTESGADEN , Germany , Sept. 15 ** Minister Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain arrived here at 4:02 p. m. today ( 10:02 a. m. , E. S. T. ) for his talks with Reichsfuhrer Hitler in search of means to assure European peace . The British leader was received by Dr. Otto Meissner , Chief of the Chancellery , who conducted him after a short stop at the Grand Hotel to Herr Hitler 's home . A special train brought Mr. Chamberlain and his party from Munich , where he had arrived earlier from London by air-plane A crowd which had gathered near the railway station cheered Mr. Chamberlain when he appeared , walking from the tram with Joachim von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Munich . Herr von Ribbentrop remained with the British Prime Minister as he motored to the hotel and thence to the meeting place . Standing at the top of the wide staircase leading into his home , the German Chancellor welcomed his visitor . After a brief exchange of greetings Herr Hitler conducted Mr. Chamberlain into the house . People lined the winding road between Berchtesgaden and Obersalzburg and cheered as the British party drove by in one of Herr Hit ? ler 's famed big black motor cars . Groups shouted " heils " and threw their green Bavarian caps into the air . Mission of Information Dominates Chamberlain Conference With Hitler , By a Stall Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor LONDON , Sept. ** good wishes of the entire British Nation . irrespective of party , went with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain when he left Heston Airport today to try to thresh out with Reichsfuhrer Hitler a peaceful solution of the Sudeten problem . The Nation 's thoughts were not altogether untinged with anxiety as to the outcome , but apart from a small group of Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political opinion bade the Prime Minister Godspeed. - Though Premier Edouard Daladier of France is understood to ' claim authorship of the idea that the two statesmen should meet , theie is some reason to believe that it had already been mooted by Herr Hitler himself . Lord Brocket , an English peer who talked with Herr Hitler Saturday during the Nuremberg rally called at Downing Street Sunday and Mr. Chamberlain apparently told Major Clement Attlee , leader of the Opposition , on Tuesday that he proposed to go . This was before M. Daladier and Mr. Chamberlain talked on the telephone Tuesday evening A Mission of Information Major Attlee , it is stated , stressed the fact that he could not commit the Labor Party to the acceptance of any decision Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Hitler might reach , but otherwise he raised no objection to the visit . In us connection it is emphasized in informed circles that Premier Chamberlain has not gone to reach any definite decision . His mission is rather described as intended to inform himself exactly what is in Herr Hitler 's mind and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop has not already done so , that Britain could not stand aside if German troops invaded Czechoslovakia . Despite this assurance from ministerial circles it is incontestable that the Opposition and even a number of Government supporters are extremely anxious about the outcome of the visit . Mr. Chamberlain can not have forgotten what happened when Sir Samuel Hoare , then Foreign Secretary , committed the Cabinet to acceptance of the Hoare-Laval plan for Ethiopia in December , 1935 . In the debate which followed the then Premier Stanley Baldwin declared that the practice which had grown up since the World War for Ministers in high positions to have discussions with one another on the Continent might . lead to " irremediable disaster " He added , " For my part I have determined that such position ' hall not be possible again , . . IL may often put a greater burden of responsibility on the Individual Minister than any individual Minister ought to be asked to carry . " Meanwhile , two points stand out in Lhe background of the Berchtes ; ide ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed an intense desire not to have to implement its promises to the Czechs The second is that disorders in the Sudeten area made a considerable section of German opinion extremely anxious to avoid war . Thus both the French and the German desire for an honorable compromise appears to have grown considerably in the past 48 hours . Another point is that during the past few days Germany has been canvassing a plan for an international conference to find a solution . It has not been clear whether Germany wanted this solution to be within the present frontiers of Czechoslovakia or whether Prague was to be asked to surrender essentially German areas in return for international guarantees of independence within restricted frontiers . Commenting on the move the Conservative Daily Telegraph and Morning Post said ' " So courageous a departure from diplomatic precedent deserves success , and the good wishes of everybody who has the appeasement of Europe at heart will accompany Mr. Chamberlain on his mission ... " It will he strange if these two men , each with a nation behind him , can not clear away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an approach to a solution . " The Laborite Daily Herald captioned Its main editorial " Good Luck , Chambeilain ! " and said , " We may hope for great things from these talks . " The News Chronicle after saying , " Something might be started at Berchtesgaden today which would not only save peace but decisively change for better tile whole outlook in Europe , " adds : " On the other hand a deal may be done which will finally betray democracy and set the seal of British approval on a technique of success tluough aggression which carries with it a certain Nemesis . " The Manchester Guardian 's London commentator says that the stroke is naturally welcomed in such a tense situation but " this is not the only reaction . " He asks whether Mr. Chamberlain 's move will be " taken for weakness . " Mr. Chamberlain , he declares . " to is thought by some , is taking a risk , but , say his friends , why should he not In continuance of his policy of appeasement now take the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 15 ( Wi  --  Wearing a dark gray overcoat and gray hat , and carrying the ' inevitable rolled umbrella , Premier Chamberlain had entered the big Lockheed plane at 8:35 a. m 12:35 a. m .. E. S. T ) . It was the first time he had flown . and he was headed for rain and fog over parts of France and Germany. : He said before he left , of the dramatic journey he decided yesterday to make : " I am going to see the German Chancellor because the situation seems to me to be one in which discussions between him and me may have useful consequences . " The Flihrer 's reply to my suggeslion encourages me to hope that my visit to him will not be without results . " At almost the same time that Mr. ' Chamberlain left 10 Downing Street , King George arrived at Euston Station from Balmoral , Scotland  --  the international crisis had caused him to return to London ahead of his schedule . The Premier , however . was unable to talk with his Monarch be-for e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were with him in the car . They were Sir Horace John Wilson , known as " the big brain " of the Civil Service , and William Strang , head of the Foreign Office 's Central European department . They arrived at Heston Airport at 8:25 , and were greeted by Viscount Halifax . British Foreign Secretary ; Herr Hordt , German Charge d'Affaires , and Baron von Selzati , German Embassy First Secretary . Cars lined the roads surrounding the port . People crushed at the gates . Tile Premier chatted with Lord and Lady Halifax , and with Sir Alexander Cadogan , Permanent Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs . The crowds , breaking away make room for the plane , shouted " Good Luck " and " Well Done " and " Stand by Czechoslovakia . " The gaunt , usually sober-faced Pi ender smiled and waved his hat . Heir Hordt shook Mr. Chamberlain 's hand and congratulated him on his " magnanimous initiative " and wished him Godspeed . Lord Londonderry , Leader of the House of Lords , handed a note through the door after Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed heartily . He showed no concern as the ship swung around  --  for the takeoff . Four seats had been removed to give the party more room . Commander C. N. Petty , senior British Amivays pilot . was at the controls , with Commander D , S. King as copilot . Fr mu all offer the world came messages wishing hnn success Personal Statesmanship Climaxed By Chamberlain-Hi tler Meeting Unprecedented in drama and in potential meanings for world peace , the flight of Prime Minister Chamberlain to talk with Reichsfuhrer Hitler climaxes the modern resort to personal statesmanship . Numerous precedents exist for the man-to-man technique , but none has ever so focused the heart-beats of a world on a simple mountain chalet and the two men seeking ways to avert an apparently inescapable explosion . Masters of foreign policy have traditionally disdained informality in affairs of state . Diplomatic procedure is regulated by rigid customs . Mr. Chamberlain has cut through these customs with the simple directness of a man making a supreme effort , as he sees it , to prevent catastrophe . His urgent message to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation I propose to come over at once to see you with the view to trying to find a peaceful solution . I propose to come across by air and am ready to start tomorrow , Please indicate the earliest time at which you can see me and suggest a place of meeting . I should be grateful for a very early reply . ( Signed ) NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN The Ftihrer replied promptly that he would " gladly receive " Mr. Chamberlain at the mountain retreat in Berchtesgaden , overlooking a town in the Bavarian Alps . A few outstanding precedents for the visit follow : 1818 ? Prime Minister Disraeli personally attends Berlin Congress on Turco-Russian peace . 1919 ? Woodrow Wilson becomes first American President to attend foreign peace conference , at Versailles . 1928 ? President-Elect Hoover makes good-will tour of South America . 1929 ?
