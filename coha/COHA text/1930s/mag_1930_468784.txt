WE SEE it all about us , in all walks of American life ? the disease of size . The biggest ship in the world is the best ship ; the tallest building in Manhattan is the best building ; the largest movie theater is the greatest , and so forth . A friend of mine employed by a large metropolitan bank recently stated that when his institution merged with another bank the cost of changing the name plates in their branches alone was more than two hundred thousand dollars . Inasmuch , however , as their deposits have doubled , their bank to-day is twice as good a bank as it was formerly . Nowhere is this disease of size more apparent than in the sports and athletics of the American nation , because the sports of a land reflect the character of a people even more clearly than does its business . Despite the reams of statistics issued annually , we are becoming less and less a race of practicing sportsmen because most of our sports have got completely out of hand . They have succumbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country has succumbed to the disease of size , that malady which ravages like a very plague . Thus football , which used to be a game , has of late become nothing but a spectacle . It is now the bullfight of the American nation . Baseball is about the same , to a less extent only because football in recent years has crowded it from the limelight . Even polo , that most delightful of sports for players and spectators alike , has begun to show signs of catching the germ . To-day THE DAVIS CUP RUNS OVER t99 trip and so keen the interest aroused throughout the West by their exhibitions , that the idea occurred to one of them to give a trophy to be competed for by the United States and England , with the purpose of attracting attention to the game and at the same time creating an interesting sporting competition . Plans were immediately started to present a cup to the United States Lawn Tennis Association , and at a meeting of their Executive Committee held in New York on the 21st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Cup offered to the Association " and it was also voted that " the appreciation of the Association be expressed to the donor . " This was the origin of the Davis Cup . Reading the history of the times , it is evident that the young Harvard undergraduate whose generosity made possible this world-wide competition did not even realize that it might eventually spread beyond the two tennis-playing nations of prominence at the moment : England and the United States . He said as much several years later , explaining that he " expected that it would result merely in one or two competitions between this country and England . " In 1000 , 1902 , and 1903 only these two nations competed in matches played with all the informality of a game of clock golf on your own front lawn . When the initial British Davis Cup team arrived on the Campania , on August 4 , 1900 , there were no newspaper men , no photographers , not even a representative from the U. S. L. T. A. to greet them . Not knowing what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis Cup team to visit foreign shores decided to see Niagara Falls . This they did while the officials of the Longwood Cricket Club , where the matches were to be held , speculated as to whether the visitors had actually landed . No contest was held in 1901 ; but in 1902 the matches were played on the lush turf of the Crescent Athletic Club at Bay Ridge , and more than five thousandpeople made the tiresome journey down from Brooklyn by trolley car . This was important as indicating the hold these international meetings were even then beginning to have upon the sporting public of the country . The next season the British again challenged ; and I remember watching my first Davis Cup match at the old Longwood Cricket Club grounds on Brookline Avenue in Boston . One paid a quarter , took a camp chair , and sat so close to the actual play that it would have been possible to touch Bill Lamed and Laurie Doherty as they changed courts in that memorable match . Late-comers stood up behind our chairs , while later-corners mounted benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to peer over the rows of standees . In the middle of the match a disputed service revealed the fact that no linesman was present on this particular line . He had , it appeared , taken the job only with the understanding that he would be relieved at a fixed hour when he was obliged to catch the last boat for his summer home at Nantasket Beach . Not being relieved , he had departed ! That afternoon two matches , upon which the fate of the cup depended , were played simultaneously on adjoining courts . Nor did the standard of play suffer , although one wonders how some of our modern temperamentalists would react under such a strain . They were men in those days . In 1904 there were Frenchmen ; during that season both France and Belgium sent their best players to enter the contests . The influence of the Cup and the fame of the contest were spreading , and the sport of lawn tennis was receiving a valuable aid in its development . Within a few years seven nations had taken up the challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , South Africa , and Belgium all competed for the privilege of meeting the holder ? the British Isles ? in a match honored by being played upon the center court at Wimbledon . The War temporarily interrupted the progress of the competition ; but by 1922 there were fifteen entries and the next year eighteen , with lands as far apart as Australia and Holland , as India and the Argentine represented . In 1924 the number jumped to twenty-four , with Hungary , Cuba , China , New Zealand , and Mexico among the newcomers . Lawn tennis was now a universal game , probably the only universal game on earth . For this the credit must be given largely to the Davis Cup . Admitting that tennis is a superb game , that it would eventually have become known , yet the fact remains that its enthusiastic adoption throughout the distant countries , and especially the smaller nations of Europe , has been due to the interest aroused by these world-wide competitions . One must journey abroad to appreciate bow the trophy is regarded and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the Davis Cup also is due the surprising advance in tennis of the Latin nations . In 1927 , when twenty-six countries entered , France won the Davis Cup ; for the first time a people not educated in the traditions of games were defeating the Anglo Saxons in their own field . England , Australia , and the United States had until that period held a monopoly in the sport , as well as the possession of the trophy . Now their reign was broken . To the generosity of an undergraduate in college is largely due not only the genius of Lacoste , Cochet , and Borotra ; but more important still , the fact that the countryside of France to-day is dotted with small tennis clubs whose bare-legged members aspire to win some day their place upon the team that fights for " La Coupe Davis . " III When the teams of the British Isles competed for the Davis Cup in 1900 three days sufficed for the matches themselves , and less than a month was necessary for the invaders to make the trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer from London , arrived in New York on August 4th and sailed on August 11th , reaching home well within thirty days after his sailing date . In other words , the average business or professional man at that time could take a vacation and play Davis Cup tennis ; owing to the traveling which is involved and the time consumed in competition , such a thing is impossible to-day . With thirty nations entering , the matches start in mid-April and continue at intervals of a fortnight or ten days until the end of July , when the challenge round is held at the Stade Roland Garros outside Paris . Let us see how this works out in individual cases . Last January a handsome and husky youth in an ancient flivver banged and bumped his way east from California to try for the American Davis Cup team . He had left his university in the middle of the year , as indeed he was obliged to do if he wished to become famous in the world of sport . His athletic odyssey began at San Antonio , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his peregrinations in search of this grail of amateur sport appears below . After each date I have indicated the places and events that claimed this young man 's company . As can be seen from this brief but documented statement , our hero before he sets foot upon his native shores will have deposited seven months of the year upon the altar of amateur sport . Whose fault is this ? Certainly not his . Obviously when the boy sees a chance to represent his nation in the greatest of all international sporting contests , he can not be blamed if at an immature age he grasps the opportunity without considering the ultimate costs . Neither is it the fault of Mr. Davis . When he presented the Cup thirty years ago he foresaw no such ridiculous and cumbersome organization , no such business as seven months devoted to playing the game of lawn tennis . Nor yet can one censure the President of the U. S. L. T. A. or the Chairman of the Davis Cup Committee , or the other gentlemen in charge of the situation ; because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person , it is the fault of the disease of size . The average college football season begins on the 15th of September andlasts until the 20th or the 25th of November , a little over two months . If seven months of continuous and concentrated play were devoted to the game what cries and lamentations about " over-emphasis " should we not hear on all sides ? What volumes would not the Carnegie Foundation shower upon us ? To-day professional baseball hardly requires more time of its players than international lawn tennis ; the ball clubs visit the training camps in early March and are mostly through with their season by the end of October . This , in a sport avowedly professional , whereas Davis Cup tennis is supposed to be an amateur game ! Let us not for a moment forget what the Davis Cup has accomplished in the short space of thirty years . It has made lawn tennis probably the most popular game in the world ; it has brought the sport to far , forgotten corners of the earth where it was a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only game -- which can be played under uniform conditions the world over ; it has bred champions and encouraged and stimulated athletics of all kinds in lands that are by nature and tradition anything but sporting . But with these many tangible benefits it has also spread in its train the virus of the disease of size . Properly to run the competition to-day committees must be formed , plans laid , reservations on steamers and trains and in hotels made , letters exchanged , and young men must take themselves out of college about Christmas , seven months before a ball is struck in the ultimate act of the drama . The plain fact is that amateur tennis is now a business which is ashamed of itself . That is the fault of no one ? or rather of us all , for we are all infected with the germs of the disease of size . IV Mr. Dwight Davis , whose generosity , sportsmanship , and intellectual integrity are beyond question , has for some years been very busy in public life and may not be aware of conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup which bears his name . Knowing his attitude toward sport , one wonders what he would think of some of the curious anomalies that have followed in the train of his gift of thirty years ago . Such prestige has the Davis Cup attained that a horde of imitators have followed in Mr. Davis 's path . This is not , be it noted , a fault of the competition itself , but simply one of the effects of its success , one of the symptoms of our old friend the disease of size . In this connection it is interesting to observe that the first sporting cups , given some fifty years or more ago , were seldom named after the donor ; thus they were not the Jones Cup or the Smith Cup or the F. Cray Griswold Cup or the Sir Thomas Lipton Cup ; but the America 's Cup and the International Challenge Cup . Of late years , however , we have been undergoing a hull market in the cup-presenting business , and we now have Walker Cups and Ryder Cups and Childs Cups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cups , some given for reasons vastly different from those behind the gift of Mr. Davis at the beginning of the present century . Is it not significant that at the moment of writing one of the latest cups to be proffered has not been officially accepted by the Association to which it was tendered ? Perhaps those in charge begin to perceive that some of these cups wear a slightly tarnished aspect . In modern times it is even fashionable for cups to bear not only a title but an entire name . Thus the United States Army authorities , believing that it would be a good idea to encourage polo in the colleges , presented the General Robert Lee Bullard Trophy . When this was won outright a year ago , a new cup was promptly put into competition by Mr. Gouverneur M. Carnochan , then vice-president and now president of the Intercollegiate Polo Association , and was called the Gouverneur M. Carnochan Trophy . Even the hotels and resorts have seen the point and thus we have the King Cole Hotel offering the King Cole Cups for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The motives of Mr. Davis were of course above reproach ; can the same be said , I wonder , for all his successors ? Observing the success of his trophy , they perceive a short-cut to fame and importance , a method of perpetuating the name of Muggins down the ages . To the best of my knowledge none of these cups has ever been presented with the stipulation that the donor 's name shall remain concealed forever . And anyone acquainted with the cup-giving racket must be continually amazed at the callousness of rich men who offer these mugs ; at their calm insistence on getting their own ends at any cost , even if the cost happens to be , as it sometimes is , the demoralization of the sport to which they have attached themselves . Not infrequently cup-donating goes to a man 's head . I know one gentleman , the donor of an international sporting trophy , who has become a petty tyrant , a bully dominating the sport in his section of the world . Another gives vast goblets for a contest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year ; it is his life . Long before the event takes place he is planning broadcasting of his pictures presenting the X Y Cup . And there is another sportsman who invited two young players to cross an ocean to play for his trophy , all expenses paid . Because they took part in a nearby event before his competition he withdrew his support and invited them to return home on their own . Not all trophies are given from selfish motives : there are , for instance , some given as memorials , and there is also the sort of trophy represented by the Wight-man Cup . This trophy for women 's tennis between American and English teams was given by Mrs. George W. Wightman of Boston , a lady who has been one of the greatest players of the game and has made many more sacri- fices for the sport in time , funds , and energy than are entailed by the presentation of a silver mug . But the truth is that the majority of the donors of these trophies are not , to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all sorts of cups offered by various gentlemen for various sports , and most of these gentlemen keep the press well informed of their doings and the progress they are making toward Putting The Cup Over Big . V It was the famous Bulletin No. 23 of the Carnegie Foundation which pointed out that the more money was taken in by intercollegiate football the more money the colleges would spend on expensive coaches and the other appendages of a winning eleven . The same is true in other sports . On the eve of the Davis Cup Challenge Round in 1929 the United States Lawn Tennis Association spent $1,950 in telephone calls from New York to Paris in a frantic effort to determine whether Mr. W. T. Tilden was an amateur or a professional ! Last season the Association received over $30,000 as its share of the various Davis Cup matches played in by the American team . Thirty years ago the British , playing on their first journey in quest of the cup , went into action within four days after funding , whereas to-day the American squad must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although its members are young , supposedly healthy , and certainly strong , unless all appearances are deceiving , they can not travel on a cabin boat or tourist third class ; they must have the bridal suite first class on a crack liner . I remember the Davis Cup player who told me he and his pal were treated " like cattle " because at the height of the season they were obliged to cross in an inside stateroom ! The disease of size carries in its wake the desire of the ultimate in physical comforts . Not merely good accommodations , but the best : the best cabins on the biggest ships and the best places in the fastest and most luxurious trains . Players who can attract huge crowds at international matches do not consider traveling simply , quietly , economically . Why should they ? The Association pays the bills . The attitude which such a method of living can create in young and impressionable boys is easy to imagine . Several years ago I came out of the Stade Roland Garros after a match with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apiece and he also carried two tennis racquets . The taxi drivers , because the stadium was beyond the city limits , demanded two hundred francs to carry us to the center of town . Five hundred yards away , within the gates , were plenty of taxis which would carry us there at the regular meter rate , six francs . We started to walk . Before we had gone ten yards my athletic companion turned back for the gyp taxi . " Hell , I ca n't walk that far with this suitcase , " he said . Unless the players are exceptionally strong-minded young men , or unless they are mature enough to stand off and laugh at the whole situation , Davis Cup tripping is demoralizing to them . It is demoralizing because they are pampered and indulged and taken de luxe about the world in a way which they will be totally unable to live up to when they begin earning their own living . Luxurious and expensive tastes are formed ; once formed , they are by no means easily changed or curtailed . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting in business life , the Davis Cup players are asked to give up the best part of the year and concentrate upon sport . The whole atmosphere of the competition creates false values . A half dozen young men are practically supported by the Association in an amateur game . Presumably they are playing for the fun of the thing , as you and I play when we go out to our club some afternoon late after work , but actually they are paid just as truly as the members of the New York Giants are paid by the owners of that baseball club , although the payment takes a different form . Certainly no one will deny that as the players upon the diamonds fill the coffers of the baseball clubs , so the tennis players attract the crowds who pay the money that fills the war chest of the Davis Cup Committee . VI There is one nation that is in unqualified favor of continuing the Davis Cup matches without changes of any sort . That nation is France . The French are sitting on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup and seems likely to hold it for several years . The matches take place in Paris , and the French team need not travel and requires hardly more than a fortnight 's practice to be ready for the Challenge Round . In 1928 the French erected the Stade Roland Garros , the most beautiful and most perfectly equipped arena of its kind in the world . In debt some hundreds of thousands of francs for this structure , the French authorities would naturally enjoy seeing the American team in the challenge round for many years to come . Certainly they would not like to see the event played in Berlin or Belgrade for the next few summers . There are other nations who favor a continuation of the Davis Cup contests along the present lines , nations that have short journeys to make and a generous recompense waiting them at the end thereof . But with some exceptions it is fair to say that the majority of the countries competing in the Davis Cup matches feel that the time for changes is at hand . Radical changes have been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were divided into two zones , European and American , each country being permitted to enter in the zone which seemed more convenient for it . Another recent change divided the former zone into northern and southern sections " to obviate the long and expensive journeys that have hitherto been necessary . " And as the disease of size gets a firmer and a firmer hold , it will probably be necessary to divide the sections into subsections , and the subsections into sub-subsections . Other nations have made other changes . In 1921 the foundation of the Mitre Cup matches for the nations of South America practically amounted to their withdrawal from the older contest . On but three occasions since that year has a South American nation competed for the Davis Cup . From time to time suggestions have been made that the matches be held every other year , or every four years . Some nations in the antipodes actually enter every other year , the cost being a determining factor . Recently the Australian Association reduced team expenses from two pounds a day , plus first-class travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and fifteen shillings a day at sea with " reasonable " and traveling expenses . An important step as showing the dissatisfaction of the Australian authorities with the competition as it exists to-day ; while even the sum to be spent this season is , as a writer in a Sydney newspaper shows , a matter for query . " If three thousand pounds were to be spent without recovering the cup , without appreciably advancing the standard of the game in Australia , and without bringing some new players into being , then , when thousands of men are being put out of employment because sovereigns are as scarce as icebergs on the equator , there surely could be no excuse for frittering away three thousand pounds of athletic trust funds . " Meanwhile Lawn Tennis and Badminton , which is the official organ of the English Lawn Tennis Association , recently advocated the abandonment of the Davis Cup and suggested an Inter-Empire competition as a desirable alternative . " The plain fact is that the Davis Cup is rapidly assuming the character of a duty rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , rather like the man who suffers from gout and knows that port is bad for him , but wo n't give it up because he likes it , and anyway he has drunk it for years . " Mr. A. Wallis Myers , a writer on lawn tennis in the London Field , remarks : " This is a sample of views which , reading between the lines , would seem to be held by many members of the present governing body in England . " Even the players themselves are beginning to rebel , are finding the Long and arduous campaign too much like a minor war . One prominent American who has won his share of honors upon the courts of the world told me this past spring that he would not make the trip even if chosen for the Davis Cup team because he was unable to take the time away from his business . Mr. Henry W. Austin , ranking English player , himself requested that he be removed from the team after the first round tie with Germany in late April , explaining that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the game without a respite . When the players feel unhappy about the situation , when cups like the Mitre Cup are springing up in other parts of the world , when the nations distant from Europe are anxious to see competition on a biennial basis , when one trip alone costs an Australian team $15,000 with an American team the same year spending nearer $20,000 , when those in authority are wondering privately whether we are really getting what we pay for ? and unofficial conversations reveal a large number among the high officials of the U. S. L. T. A. so minded ? is it not time to ask ourselves whether the disease of size has not gone far enough ? Most diseases can be cured if taken in time . But time does not wait forever in a situation of this sort . VII Several years ago Mr. Vincent Richards , the professional tennis champion , happened to be in Paris during the Challenge Round . The Davis Cup team of a foreign nation had played in Berlin a short time previously , and the president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play an exhibition match there against a leading European professional . The matter was amicably arranged until the question of terms arose , when the gentleman from Berlin , hearing the sum needed to secure Mr. Richards ' services for a short visit , threw up his hands . " Ali , you cost more than that entire Davis Cup team , " he said . Statements made privately by Mr. Louis B. Dailey , the President of the U. S. L. T. A. , are interesting as showing that the authorities here are giving serious attention to the evils of this disease of size . " There are many objections to the way in which some amateurs are conducting themselves to-day , " remarked Mr. Dailey recently , " and that is a matter which is going to receive careful consideration from this administration . Let 's get out of the twilight zone and have real amateurs and real professionals . Let 's make it impossible to make a living out of the game of tennis and still call yourself an amateur . " Those words ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport . Real amateurs and real professionals ! Can a player who is openly subsidized for seven months of the year , no matter how worthy the cause , be a real amateur ? The question is hardly open to argument . Aside from those who in one manner or another make a good thing out of the Davis Cup matches ? a number that is large and increasing rapidly ? the people who will most sternly oppose any vital modifications in the contest are likely to be the sentimentalists . They will tell us that we are destructive , that we have no heart , no feeling for the traditions of the game . But on the contrary , because we do care for the traditions of the game , we should like to see the matches for the Davis Cup either given up or vitally altered . We do not believe that the spectacle of young men being paid to devote six or seven months to a few matches of lawn tennis is a diverting spectacle , that it is worth the price paid , or that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps his eyes open must be aware that in many lands the Davis Cup matches have degenerated into a question of making money , and that all sporting considerations are secondary . And we do not believe this to be in accord with the traditions bequeathed to us by Mr. Whitman , Mr. Davis , Mr. Ward , and Mr. Wright . We know that in some countries of Europe the question of amateurism is not a factor when players are chosen , and that many of those competing are no more amateurs than Babe Ruth or Jack Sharkey . Would it then be best to do away with the Davis Cup matches altogether ? I do not pretend to say , I do not know , perhaps no one person knows , although a study of the situation by a group of impartial sportsmen ( not interested in the Davis Cup as a first class gate-puller ) would quickly tell the story . It may well be that the time has come for Mr. Davis , sitting in the ducal palace in Manila , seriously to consider whether there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tray from further competition . Or whether it would be preferable to make radical changes in the present organization of the matches . First of all , it must be considered whether an international contest of this kind is desirable and advisable . If so , it remains to devise some plan to conduct it under more reasonable conditions , to hold the matches in a matter of days rather than months as at present . Objections would be raised to any scheme suggested , drawbacks would arise to any method adopted . But it is hard to be-. lieve that if the competition were regarded as worth continuing , there could be found no way of holding it in a sensible manner . Thus it might take place at Wimbledon just before or just after the All England Championships . Sup pose each nation sent a team of four players , two singles and a doubles side to play three matches every day for six days . The nations would compete in a regular tournament , the holding country to play throughout the week instead of standing aloof as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the players , but such a strain is inevitable in any big tournament where five-set matches are the rule every day . Under such a plan a business man could take a vacation of a month and play Davis Cup tennis . If the venue were shifted from year to year it might do far more to stimulate interest in the game and attract young players than it does now . I am not rash enough to suggest such an idea as a panacea , I suggest it merely to show the possibilities . Only a proper and competent committee from the various nations can determine the exact remedy for the disease which has so affected this greatest of all international sporting trophies . Thirty years ago the Davis Cup had a specific job to do . That task was to spread the doctrine of good sportsmanship , to cultivate friendly relations among different nations , to promote the game of lawn tennis , to introduce it into the many parts of the globe where a tennis racquet had never been seen . This it did . The task laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis Cup is better known the world over than any other memorial to sport , and the game for which it stands is played as is no other game on earth . Did you ever hear of the Gezira Sporting Club in Cairo , or the Selanger Club at Kuala Lompur in the Federated Malay States , or the Togashi Lawn Tennis Club at Tokyo , or the Blau Weiss Club in Berlin , or the Davos Lawn Tennis Club in the Grisons , or the Leopold Club in Brussels , or the Brasilio Machado N eto , in Sao Paulo , Brazil ? Probably not , for they are not in An gIo-Saxon lands . Yet without the help and assistance which has arisen from the interest taken in the Davis Cup , many of these clubs would not exist . This to its everlasting renown . But to-day the matches for the Davis Cup have outlived their usefulness . No more are they a spreader of the gospel , because the gospel has been well and hilly spread ; no more are they the necessity they were thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game of lawn tennis . Instead they are a breeder of trouble , a topheavy , inflated , commercial enterprise , sick unto death with the disease of size . May it not be that the time has come to ring down the curtain upon the last act of this international farce ?
