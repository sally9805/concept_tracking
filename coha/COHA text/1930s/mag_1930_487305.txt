In the Driftway THERE are two kinds of people in the world  --  those who write and sell advertising and those who do n't . And though the Drifter can not always praise their handiwork as he finds it displayed in the blank spaces of the world , he counts his advertising friends among the most refreshing and amusing of all people . Their attitude toward life is sunny and uncomplicated , especially if they are good copy writers . They have a faith , at least in that new pill they are putting over , that is touching in a world of little faith : Most of them , it is true , make the concession of laughing a little at themselves and at " the game . " But it is only a concession , for the advertising man knows that he will get even you in the end . ND then there is the jargon of advertising . It changes and grows like any language , and each year some new phrase is king . This year the phrase is " establish obsolescence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy with the manufacturers to put across a little scheme that the latter have been working at for a long time . In the days of our grandfathers things were supposed to last for a long time . But it is obvious to anyone that if products lasted a lifetime the stream of buying and selling would be interrupted , purchasing power would be thwarted , and the new economy would be upset . Therefore , in the first place , do n't make things that will last too long  --  enter the manufacturers with that weaker thread , those narrower seams , those terrible shoelaces , that saltless salt , and that silkless silk good housewives have been complaining about . In the second place , " establish obsolescence " by advertising . Nobody wants to be old-fashioned . Moreover , nobody can resist novelty . If he can , he ought to be deported before he drags down the standard of living . Make him buy a new set of furniture once a year instead of once in a generation . S0 it goes , on and on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an attempt ( which was abandoned ) to invent a new disease for a new medicine , lighted upon " sensitive teeth . " " Why , " asks one beautiful young lady of another beautiful young lady in a snappy layout for a full-page spread , " does ice cream hurt my teeth ? " As the Drifter recalls it , the answer had to do with a new little germ or some other agency whose devastating work could be offset , needless to say , only by the preparation named in the large letters at the bottom of the layout . . .. A product can not be sold for a dollar unless its actual manufacture costs ten cents or less . Ninety cents must go for advertising and distribution . . . . " Sorrow " advertising , which " pulled " in the gay days before the hard times came , does not go so well now . The people want " joy . " This fact has been established by a firm which recently tried bath kinds for three weeks in a number of cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies who pose for Pond 's or let their bedrooms pose for Simmons to give the proceeds to charity  --  though they do n't all do it . Alice Longworth , when asked to what charity her check should be sent , gave the Longworth address . She thought charity should begin at home . . . . There was probably one person who was neither shocked nor displeasedby the Lindsey-Manning spectacle in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine . No living public-relations counsel could be anything but pleased at the ensuing Monday morning front-page headlines . C ERTAINLY the ways of advertising are strange and fascinating , but the Drifter can hardly decide what adjective should . be applied to the " Holiday Wish " of the manufacturer of a certain remedy for indigestion . It is widely displayed and it goes about as follows : " Our Holiday Wish is that neither you nor your family may be afflicted with acute indigestion  --  but in smaller type you 'd better be prepared with a bottle of 37 THE DRIFTER Correspondence Mishandling Facts To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibit the mishandling of known facts that occurs much too frequently on the editorial pages of metropolitan dailies . The New York Times of December 10 offers a typical performance . On the preceding day President Hoover issued his celebrated " china-shop statement " charging members of Congress with " playing politics with human misery " and declaring that any increase in appropriations beyond the sums recommended by him would force an increase in taxes . By the crude device of adding all the figures contained in pending appropriation bills he was able to produce the intimidating total of $4,500,000,000 ? although even a Times editorial writer should know that such totals are meaningless , since only a fraction of the bills- have any chance of passage . When Mr. Hoover first resorted to this disingenuous trick  --  at the last session  --  it was promptly exposed by Senator Glass , with the result that the President virtually apologized the next day . But the Times editorial writer , swallowing the whole works , hook , line , and sinker , commended the President for " doing his duty in calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders " of both parties were standing with the President for " moderate and prudent policies . " What were the facts ? It was obvious that the President 's statement was aimed particularly at the Senate proposal to grant $60,000,000 for drought relief . A few hours after the President 's statement was issued  --  and many hours before the Times went to press  --  the Senate voted the $60,000,000 . Instead of the " responsible leaders of both parties " standing with the President , Senator Robinson , the Democratic leader , joined with Senator McNary , the assistant Republican leader , in leading the fight for the measure , and not a single vote was cast against it . My prohibition would apply also to news broadcasters , of whom H. V. Kaltenborn probably is the rankest and most consistent offender . I cite the instance when he alluded to the unsuccessful motion in the Senate to require Senator-elect James J. Davis of Pennsylvania to step aside until the Nye committee could complete its investigation of his campaign fund . Mr. Kaltenborn told the radio audience that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive expenditures , but that to keep a man out of his seat on " mere suspicion " or the surmise " that something improper might be discovered later " was an outrage . He added tastefully that Senator Nye had been " getting a little too loud-mouthed about his committee lately . " Again , what were the facts ? In offering the motion Nye reported to the Senate that the total known to have been expended in behalf of the DavisBrown ticket in the Republican primary was well in excess of $600,000 , this being $215,000 in excess of the amount reported to the committee in Davis 's behalf , and that the committee 's request for further time to complete the inquiry was made necessary by the failure of Davis 's own campaign managers to make a complete report . Every word of this was a matter of official record , and had been published in the news columns ; when Mr. Kaltenborn broadcast his misleading and abusive synopsis . As a matter of fact , the Nye committee went ahead with its inquiry and within forty-eight hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended in behalf of the Davis-Brown ticket in the primary  --  with more than half the State yet to be heard from ! Washington , December 12 PAUL Y. ANDERSON Concerning Mayor Rolph To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I read- with strong disapproval your recent indorsement of James Rolph , Republican , for Governor of California " because of his marked liberal leanings " and because of your " strong hope that he will see justice done Mooney and Billings . " It might interest you to know that Rolph 's police force was responsible for Mooney 's arrest , since Rolph was mayor at the time . Rolph is more bitter in his denunciation of Mooney than Young has been and thinks that Mooney is where he belongs . As for your belief that Rolph is a liberal , I hasten to disillusion you by pointing out that Rolph did n't even mention unemployment in his platform . And are you not acquainted with the record of Mr. Rolph 's shipping hfonapany in relation to its seamen ? Mr. Rolph , then , can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upton Sinclair , who was the Socialist candidate , came out , on the other hand , for the immediate and unconditional pardon of Mooney and Billings . He proposed to give prompt attention to the unemployment problem . I might-also add that Sinclair is for the repeal of California 's criminal-syndicalist law . Los Angeles , Cal. , November 24 JOE ZAMERES Mother Jones and Socialism To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Your statement that the late Mother Jones-was " unqualifiedly averse to socialism " strikes me as very misleading . I knew Mother Jones so intimately over a period of thirty years that she at one time wanted me to write her biography . I always regarded her as a Socialist . When I first met her she was selling Robert Blatchford 's Socialist book , " Merrie England , " on her propaganda tours . She was a cofounder with J. A. Wayland of the Socialist weekly paper , the Appeal to Reason , and for years Wayland 's home in Girard , Kansas , was the nearest approach to anything that she herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was ever at war with Socialist Party officialdom ( Victor Berger , Morris Hillquit , and the rest ) , but Eugene Debs was her close friend and valiant admirer and she was intimately associated with Professor George D. Herron ( founder of the Rand School ) , Gaylord Wilshire , and other prominent Socialists . I have repeatedly heard her affirm her Socialist faith and I have never known of her denying it . The way out of industrial bondage , she used to say , lies in the workers " getting together and fighting for one fraternal principle  --  the principle of social ownership of all the means of production . " New York , December 8 LEONARD D. ABBOTTExciting News from Oregon To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The recent election in Oregon deserves a special article in The Nation , and its results should be listed among the events of the year for which the editor is thankful . We elected Mr. Julius Meier governor on an independent ticket , the first time in our history that an independent candidate has won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a platform calling for the public development and ownership of hydroelectric power and the abolishment of our so-called Public Service Commission . At the same time we enacted a constitutional amendment providing for power districts , the bill sponsored by the Grange and ably championed by Mr. Meier during the campaign . A similar bill was passed by the State of Washington at the same election . This was Mr. Meier 's first venture into politics . He is president of the large Meier and Frank department store , one of the largest on the Pacific Coast . He forsook his wealthy associates and defied them in taking up the fight for the public welfare started by his lifelong and dearly loved friend , State Senator Joseph , who was nominated on the same platform on the Republican ticket at the primaries and who suddenly died from a heart attack shortly after his nomination . The Republican State Central Committee met and scrapped the Joseph platform by nominating their former chairman as Mr. Joseph 's successor . This created a revolt . Nearly five thousand of us met at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run as an independent . As a candidate he fulfilled our highest expectations . In his addresses and in talks over the radio he struck out straight from the shoulder with facts and figures which left the private utilities gasping for breath . He conducted his campaign so squarely and honestly that he soon had hundreds of us campaigning for him , not as paid workers but as volunteers in a great cause and for the election of a splendid man . He will be a national figure soon . At this same election , the congressional district including Portland , a strong Republican district in a strong Republican State , elected 1VIajor General Charles H. Martin , retired , against a Republican candidate who was up for reelection and who was sidestepping all the issues . General Martin was nominated as a Democrat by having his name written in at the primary . He made his own platform : public ownership , development , and operation of hydroelectric and a national referendum on prohibition . And in this , a " dry " State , he won hands down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did no boasting about his record , which is very distinguished . He was recently retired from the army , having passed the age limit , but is young in mind and body . He will be a force for good in Congress , as he will back every forward-looking movement , such as the two Norris bills . He is an independent Progressive Democrat  --  able , honest , and fearless . To complete the picture I must mention the election of Ralph Clyde to the office of city commissioner by enough first-choice votes to elect for both a short term , lasting till July , 1931 , and a long term of four years , beginning July , 1931 . He ran on the same platform as Governorzelect Meier . He is president of our State Municipal Ownership League , a former member of the old city council , and a former legislator , who has always stood foursquare for municipal ownership and who is a terrible thorn in the side of the private utilities . He has already caused the commission to file on two good power sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of service for the common good . Portland , Ore. , December 6 CHARLES B. FRISBIE Counsel of Timidity To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I have read the editorial in your issue of November 26 entitled An Overcrowded Ocean , and I am unable to tell whether you mean it to be for or against an American merchant marine . Or are you really deploring the present overcrowded condition on the ocean ? If The Nation is for an American merchant marine , more power to it . If you are against an American merchant marine , I hope you may have no influence . But to say that an overcrowded condition of business is a good reason for staying out of it is merely a counsel of timidity . How about the last builder of one of these giant skyscrapers in New York City ? Surely he is putting up a building in an already overcrowded area . The only way he can hope to fill his new building with tenants is to take them away from less desirable buildings . I look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have now that we have grown up , just as a man may need a silk hat and a stick after he gets along a bit . As for competition , if we build good enough ships and if we cash in wisely on the joy of riding in a ship bearing our country 's flag , we will not have to worry about getting a fair share of passengers . Economically , it may be difficult , but it is not impossible . Your editorial is cleverly written by someone who knows his way about in marine affairs , but by one who gets his leanings probably from the British idea of this thing , ably supported by the French , Germans , and Italians , not to mention the Dutch and the Scandinavians .
