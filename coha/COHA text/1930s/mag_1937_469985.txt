HistoRY is a curious thing . Every day it is unfolding all about us , yet never can we measure its shape precisely . For with each new event that takes place , each new idea or opinion or prophecy that enters our minds , its dimensions seem to change . To understand any period of history ? to say nothing of writing about it ? is like trying to design a house to be made of blocks every one of which varies in size and weight and color with the temperament and experience of the builder , the place where he happens to be standing at the moment , and the passage of time . To illustrate how history unfolds , I know of no better way than to examine the story of a single day ? one far enough back to give us the advantage of considerable hindsight , but near enough to us to be within the scope of our own memories . For this purpose I choose Tuesday , September 3 , 1929 ; partly because it is a convenient distance from us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons which will shortly be apparent . Most of us , I suppose , have no definite unassisted recollection of what we ourselves were doing that day . We may recall , after some reflection , where we spent that summer or that month or even that week ; we may even be able to make a reasonable guess as to how we occupied the hours ; but if a district attorney should point a long finger at us and say , " What were you doing on September 3 , 1929 ? " we should probably need to have our memories refreshed . Here , then , is some refreshment . To begin with , it was a very hot day . In the Far West and the South , to be sure , the temperatures were moderate ; but from the coast of Maine to the wheatfields of Nebraska the sun shone down implacably . The preceding day , Monday , had been Labor Day ? the last Labor Day of Coolidge-Hoover prosperity . ( The stock-market panic was to begin within seven weeks . ) On Monday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmares of congestion as endless lines of cars full of sunburned and sweltering vacationists and week-enders crept cityward through the night , inch by angry inch . On the New Jersey highways leading to New York the tie-up had been so complete that people by the thousands , hopeless of reaching the Holland Tunnel for hours , had parked their cars in Newark or Hoboken and finished the journey to Manhattan by subway . To the men and women who returned to work on Tuesday morning in stifling offices and factories and shops , the day brought new discomfort . In New York the thermometer rose to its highest mark of the summer , 94.2 ' ; in Detroit , Chicago , and Kansas City it reached 90 ' ; in St. Louis , 92 ? ; in Minneapolis , 94 ? ; in Boston , 97 ? . Yes , the third of September was hot . To judge by the headlines in the next day 's New York papers , the most exciting and important events of September 3rd , aside from the heat and from purely local happenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a golf tournament , and two incidents in aviation . The Prime Minister was Ramsay MacDonald , and his speech was delivered before the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva . The reason why it made the front page in America ? the New York Times , for example , giving it the righthand position with a three-column headline ? was that MacDonald announced that negotiations between Great Britain and the United States for the limitation of naval armaments were progressing very favorably , and that complete agreement seemed near . ( Does this statement perhaps fail to bring back to you very clearly the situation in 1929 ? Small wonder ; for naval negotiations have been so frequent , both before then and after , that the particular ones to which Ramsay MacDonald so hopefully referred are quite lost for most of us in a vague haze of conferences and diplomatic frustrations . But you may recall what happened a few weeks later : the Prime Minister himself crossed the Atlantic to continue the conversations in person with President Hoover , and the two men sat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rural camp . ) The golf tournament which appeared in the headlines was the National Amateur Championship at Pebble Beach , California . The play on September 3rd was remarkable , among other things , for a freak shot ; the English golfer , Cyril Tolley , played an approach which was intended for the eighteenth green but landed instead in a pine tree ? and the ball stayed there , sixty feet in the air , securely wedged between two branches . But it was remarkable also for the presence of a great champion . The incomparable Bobby Jones , on whom all eyes were fixed , tied for first place in the qualifying round with Gene Homans of Englewood , New Jersey . Would Jones go on through the match-play rounds to win his fifth American amateur title ? This question undoubtedly interested more Americans than any problem raised by Ramsay MacDonald 's address . ( Jones did not win , as it happened . The next day he was put out of the tournament by young Johnny Goodman , who in turn was shortly eliminated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy to whom the newspapers of September , 1929 , paid very little attention but who in 1934 and 1935 was to come near rivaling Jones 's prowess : W. Lawson Little , Jr . Johnny Goodman 's turn as champion was to come in 1937 . ) Of the two incidents in aviation , one was a triumph , the other a disaster . The Graf Zeppelin , having successfully circled the world , was on its way home across the Atlantic Ocean from Lakehurst to Friedrichshafen ; by Tuesday evening it had completed the crossing . Observers in little Spanish towns saw it floating overhead , its cabins brilliantly lighted against the sky . When midnight brought September 3rd to a close , the ship was approaching Bordeaux , the worst of its long perils past . The disaster was the crash of a Transcontinental Air Transport plane in New Mexico during a thunderstorm , with the loss of eight lives . The blow which this accident appeared to deal to American air transport was serious . Early in July the T.A.T. , with Colonel Lindbergh as its adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Santa Fe . In newspaper advertisements you could see Lionel Barrymore as he alighted from the " Airway Limited , " which had reduced the time from New York to Los Angeles to the record-breaking time of forty-eight hours . Passengers took a Pennsylvania sleeper from New York to Columbus , Ohio , flew by day from Columbus to Waynoke , Oklahoma , took a Santa Fe sleeper to Clovis , New Mexico , and continued by air to the coast . Every precaution for safety seemed to have been taken ; no night flying was permitted . And now , before the end of the first summer , one of the big trimotor planes lay in ruin on the slope of Mount Taylor in New Mexico . ( Compare these two events in the light of subsequent progress in aviation . The first of them was hopeful ? yet during the next eight years no lighter-than-air ship crossed the North Atlantic except the Graf Zeppelin herself and the ill-fated Hindenburg , and meanwhile the United States Navy 's experience with dirigibles was distinctly unhappy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Los Angeles and New York has now become a scheduled commonplace . Still there are occasional airplane transport disasters ; but by this time we know ? or think we know ? that they are but slight setbacks in an inevitable progress . ) Turn the pages of the newspaper and you will find a variety of other events of September 3rd . You will find that in North Carolina a jury was being chosen for the trial of sixteen strikers and alleged Communists for the killing of the Chief of Police in the cotton-mill town of Gastonia , where an ugly industrial conflict had been going on for months . You will find an echo of the oil scandals of the Harding Administration : Harry F. Sinclair , serving a term in the District of Columbia jail for contempt of the Senate , was informed that he would no longer be permitted to leave its walls on errands for the jail physician , to whom he had been assigned as " pharmaceutical assistant . " You will find Commander Byrd ? not yet an Admiral ? waiting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Pole , and meanwhile passing the time by starting a radio impulse that drew the curtains from an enlarged picture of him at the National Radio Exposition at Los Angeles . Babe Ruth , you will observe , made no home run on September 3rd , but his home-run score for the season was still the best in the American League ; he had already made 40 homers in 1929 , as against 31 for Jimmy Foxx and 29 for Lou Gehrig . That evening " Sweet Adeline " opened in New York ? a musical show which exemplified a new tendency to return in nostalgic mood to the sentimentsand absurdities of the nineties . Eddie Cantor was appearing in " Whoopee " ; " Street Scene " and " Journey 's End " were in high favor with playgoers . New Yorkers who preferred the movies to the theater could take their choice between " Our Modern Maidens , " with Joan Crawford and Rod laRocque ; " The Lady Lies , " with Claudette Colbert and Walter Huston ; " Bulldog Drummond , " with Ronald Colman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolson . Those who stayed at home and turned the knobs of their radios could listen to the Fada Symphony Orchestra , the Pure Oil Band , Whiteman 's Old Gold Orchestra , or the Freed Orchestradians . From the social columns of the newspaper you may learn that ex-Governor Alfred E. Smith had wandered far enough from the sidewalks of New York to be the guest of honor at a luncheon at fashionable Southampton , where he spoke to the other guests about social service . Having been defeated by Herbert Hoover in the 1928 election , Smith was now preparing himself for a loftier if narrower presidency ? that of the Empire State Building . But as yet this skyscraper was only a project on paper . At the corner of Fifth Avenue and Thirty-fourth Street , where it was soon to rise , workmen were tearing down the old brickandbrownstone Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to make room for it . You will find in the newspaper other things , not presented as news at all , which now take on a significance quite different from that which they seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The departmentstore advertisements , for example : then they looked quite natural ; now they look curious indeed . They show girls in daytime dresses with deep V-necks and long waists , in which it is still apparently the desire of every woman to look as narrow and flat-fronted as possible . ( Not yet had Mae West 's curves become a national influence . ) The evening dresses reach just below the knees in front , though on the sides they have panels that reach the floor and presage the coming of the long dress of the early nineteen thirties . And the hats are stranger still : helmets which fit tightly right down to the nape of the neck and flare out back of the ears , so that to the eyes of 1937 the young woman of fashion in 1929 would seem to be equipped for an open-cockpit airplane ride rather than for the street . Or take a second glance at the list of current motion pictures . You will find some listed as " talking " ; others ? just about as many ? as " silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still enough of a novelty for critics to be arguing about the difference in technic between it and the silent picture , and regarding it more or less as an awkward parvenu . But the thing for which September 3 , 1929 , will probably be longest remembered you will not find recorded in the newspapers at all . Indeed , there could hardly be a better example of the contrast between the perspective of the newspaper and the perspective of history than the almost absent-minded way in which the daily papers set forth a phenomenon of great historical significance ? the daily table of prices on the New York Stock Exchange . The fact that September 3rd had brought the Dow-Jones averages to a new high mark was hardly news at all then . It commanded no staring headlines . Financial commentators remarked that bullish enthusiasm had resulted in " another in the long series of consecutive new high records established by the share market " ; that was all . Newspaper editors do not whip themselves into frenzies over the usual . The editors had no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial beach by this latest wave of speculative excitement would stand untouched for a long time to come . Yet it was on September 3 , 1929 , that the big bull market reached its peak . Indeed , if we are to regard any single day as marking the climax of CoolidgeHoover prosperity , the statistical evidente would seem to be clear : September 3 , 1929 , was that day . It was then that the American people crossed the economic divide and began to go downhill into the great depression . Of the historical significance of the figures on the financial pages you and I were then utterly unconscious . We had no idea that we were crossing a divide . Surely , we thought , there was higher ground just ahead Yet at that very moment the path under our feet was turning downward . II Is it still difficult , from these scattered clues in the newspapers , to recapture the mood of that torrid late-summer day ? Return to it and look about you . Men and women from Portland to Portland ? tens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices watching the trans-Iux tape tell its story of the day 's high prices : United States Steel surging up to an all-time high of 261% and closing at 257% ; American Telephone closing at 3021/4 ; General Electric at 391 ( the equivalent of 97% ( Ai the present shares ) ; Radio at 981/8 ; Consolidated Gas at 180% ; Westinghouse at 285% . Conversation about the stock market , about soand-so 's phenomenal winnings , about janitors and cowboys and nursemaids making fortunes in Montgomery Ward , is everywhere ; one hears it at dinner parties , in street cars , on commuting trains . Prohibition is another constant topic . The Eighteenth Amendment is in full force ? and so are the bootleggers . Very few people believe that repeal of the Amendment is a reasonable possibility . Well-informed students of politics argue convincingly that a few dry States could block it indefinitely . Moralists are attributing the prevalence of crime to the dire influence of the speakeasy , and lamenting that even men and women of substance and influence insist upon presenting themselves of an evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given a careful appraisal by Tony or Mino before passing in to enjoy their Martinis . In New York , the man-abouttown has in his wallet a collection of little autographed speakeasy cards , just in case he should wish to go where he is not already well known as a patron or as a " friend of Mr. Jones 's . " President Hoover has appointed a commission to study the whole question of law enforcement , and this very day its chairman , George W. Wickersham , is traveling from New York to Washington and going over the agenda for to-morrow morning 's meeting of the commission , at which he and the other members will decide whom to put in charge of various surveys . They are beginning surveys of the way in which the courts operate , of probation , of parole , of crime among the foreign-born , of lawlessness among government officials , and so on through a long list . Prohibition is only one of many matters which they propose to investigate ; indeed , in five long pages of minutes of to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to the general public nothing in their program but prohibition seems to matter . The wet-or-dry issue is the hottest one in American politics . Colonel Lindbergh has just returned to Hicksville , Long Island , after doing some spectacular stunt flying with the " High Hat Squadron " of naval aviators at the Cleveland Air Races . The Colonel has been married now for several months . His wife made her first solo flight only a few days ago at Hicksville . Not till next year will Charles A. Lindbergh , Jr. , be born ; not for two and a half years will tragedy descend upon their house . Bill Tilden does not yet know whether he will succeed in winning his seventh American amateur tennis championship in the tournament which is to begin at Forest Hills next Saturday ? but he will . It will be his last one , though . The sporting era of the unquestioned supremacy of Tilden and Jones and Ruth is drawing near its close . All Quiet on the Western Front leads the list of best-selling books , running well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art of Thinking . The first edition of Ernest Hemingway 's A Farewell to Arms is being bound ; it will be published in a few weeks . . . Al Capone is serving a year 's sentence at the Eastern Penitentiary at Philadelphia for carrying a pistol , but his name is still one to conjure with , . . . Look about you on the streets : notice the automobiles ? all long horizontal lines , with hard rightangles to the windows ; few curves , no pointed prows , no streamlined bulges anywhere . .. . Among the names familiar to the general public , names which appear often in the press , are those of Bishop Cannon , Texas Guinan , Senator Heflin , Mabel Walker Willebrandt , Hugo Eckener , Dolly Gann , Mayor Jimmy Walker , " Doug and Mary , " Legs Diamond . . . . Prosperity is taken for granted . In Chicago , Samuel Insult is at the summit of his career ; he is watching the stock of Insull Utilities Investments touch a high price for the day of 115 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago at less than 8 . He is preparing to launch yet another super-super-corporation , and to witness the Civic Opera 's first season in the mammoth building which he has provided for it . . . . In Detroit , big business men are discussing the movement to combine dozens of banks in huge groups . . . . In New York , the Chrysler Building is shooting upward , and the first cables have just been strung across the Hudson for what everybody calls the Hudson River Bridge but will later learn to call the George Washington Bridge . . . . Investors are wondering whether to turn in their blue-chip common stocks in exchange for shares in the new Blue Ridge investment trust . . . The day 's volume of trading on the Big Board is 4,438,910 shares ; call money for speculators is at nine per cent ; and a financial editor for one of the New York papers is hammering out his copy for to-morrow morning 's edition : " Steel operations have declined , but Wall Street may be pardoned for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline has been postponed till the end of the summer . " Why not buy now , you may be saying to yourself , if you have money in the bank or can borrow it ? why not buy " before the good stocks are all taken out of the market by these investment trusts " ? III Historians can hardly help distorting . Even the most conscientious of them unwittingly present the past in an over-logical pattern . Knowing what was to happen after the events which they are chronicling , they nearly always make it seem too inevitable . They make us feel that anybody with any sense ought to have been able to foresee it . They lead us to forget how heavily the path ahead is obscured by fog , how infinite are the number of directions which the course of events may take . They also over-simplify . They can hardly help doing so . It is impossible to tell more than one story at a time without filling one 's narrative with confusion . If one is telling what happened to the tariff , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remind the reader that even while the tariff struggle was taking place , statesmen had other problems to worry about , and citizens went right on being excited about the World 's Series and the heat wave and the latest crime . The reader might thus be led to imagine that for a time nothing but the tariff interested anybody . These two factors of hindsight and over-simplification sometimes give us an oddly misleading impression of the state of affairs at any moment in the past , and particularly of the atmosphere in which public leaders did their daily work and faced their daily problems . From some of the books which have recently been written about American neutrality from 1914 to 1917 one might gather that Woodrow Wilson could foresee that the war in Europe would continue until 1917 , and that the Germans would undertake unlimited submarine warfare ; and , furthermore , one might gather that the question of neutrality was the only important question of policy which Wilson confronted . From some versions of more recent history one might gather the idea that Franklin Roosevelt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complete collapse of the banking system in 1933 and ought , therefore , to have explained that on the arrival of this disaster he would feel the need to do things which had not been included in the 1932 platform . And from other versions of recent history one might suppose that on the third of September , 1929 , Herbert Hoover must have anticipated a panic which would lead to a prolonged depression , and that he had nothing much to do but decide how he would meet this emergency . One might forget how varied and pressing were the responsibilities of the Presidency , how complex was the scene , and how dense the fog ahead . On that day President Hoover had just returned to the blinding heat of Washington from a week-end at his Rapidan camp . The Cabinet met with him from 10:30 till 12 . He had only two other appointments : Representative Fort of New Jersey called at 10 , former Secretary of State Kellogg called at noon . He spent most of the rest of the day engaged with his secretarial staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting through the routine labor of the hardest job in the world . As guests at the White House the Hoovers had Dr. Hubert Work , who had been serving as the head of the Republican National Committee , and also Governor Green of Michigan and his wife . Since the National Committee was soon to meet , we may assume that questions of party organization , of appointments , and of political strategy occupied at least some of the attention of the President and his guests at the White House . These questions were numerous and pressing . Of what the Cabinet discussed that morning we have no record ; but we do know what were some of the problems which worried its members and particularly the President . There were the armament negotiations with Great Britain , with all their naval technicalities and diplomatic difficulties . Mr. Hoover had learned that three American shipbuilding companies had retained a " naval expert , " one William B. Shearer , as an " observer " at a recent disarmament conference , presumably to try to block naval reduction ; should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , three days later . ) There was the thorny tariff question , on which a Senate committee was about to present a report to which Borah and a group of Progressives had just announced their opposition : here was another nest of technicalities , here were other problems of conciliation and adjustment . There was a danger that Russia and China might go to war over the Chinese Eastern Railroad in North Manchuria ? a danger which we forget now because it was averted . There was prohibition , and farm relief , and Mexican policy , and so on through a long list It is characteristic of the temper of the time that when on September 4th the New York Herald-Tribune devoted a long editorial to a laudatory review of Hoover 's first six months in office it cited many achievements and referred to many problems , but said not one word about the stock market , nor hinted in so much as a line that the President was responsible for the maintenance of economic stability . Such prosperity as the country had been enjoying ? let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great many people thought the market was dangerously high and would some clay break and cause a lot of trouble , and the President himself had been disturbed at the situation ; but among all the storm clouds on the horizon few people saw an economic depression of major proportions . Exactly what went through Herbert Hoover 's mind during those oppressive hours of September 3rd nobody else can possibly know and probably he himself could not now recall , but it may be that never once during the day did he turnhis attention to the general economic situation or experience any forebodings of economic collapse . This conjecture is not set down either in defense of Hoover or in condemnation . I am simply trying to convey a suggestion of the way things looked in Washington on September 3 , 1929 . There was much to be done , there were problems and complexities and confusions ; but the man in the White House , and those other men who walked slowly through the glaring sunlight of Washington to confer with him at the Cabinet meeting , were not aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even intelligent , well-informed , conscientious men do not know the shape of things to come . IV At any moment there are diminishing currents in the great stream of history , and there are also currents gaining in volume and strength . There are things ending , waves of popular excitement subsiding , men moving into the twilight of their careers ; and there are also things beginning , future events being quietly prepared for , men walking about unknown who some day will move in a blaze of glory or of notoriety . On that September 3rd the last surviving veteran of the Mexican War died . . . . It was sixteen and a half years since William H. Taft had ridden down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol with smiling President-elect Wilson by his side ; now Taft was Chief Justice of the United States , but he was in declining health ; he had but a few months more to live . . . . Thomas A. Edison was in his eightythird year , and his achievements as an inventor were behind him ; on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he sat up in a chair and smoked cigars and declared that he expected to go out from Llewellyn Park to Dearborn in a few weeks for the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of his incandescent light . ( His expectation was justified ; when the celebration took place , he was there ; he had two full years still to live . ) . . . Calvin Coolidge 's life work was behind him too ; the fierce light of publicity which beats upon the chief executive had turned from him to Hoover the preceding March , and he was living quietly in Northampton . . Here and there , through the country , one might find surviving traces of popular movements which had once swept mightily across the land : men who believed as fervently as ever that the United States must at once join the League of Nations ; churchmen to whom the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy was as live as in the clays of the Dayton trial ; one-time Bull Moosers who had worshiped Theodore Roosevelt and could not yet think of the " Long , Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were grizzled men who had marched upon Washington with Coxey 's Army ; elderly bankers who could tell you what it was like to pace the corridors of the Morgan Library while an old man sitting in a red-plush chair shuffled his solitaire cards and decided how to meet the panic of 1907 ; cx-Kleagles of the Ku Klux Klan whose white gowns were put away in boxes in their attics ; Florida realestate men who had hopefully laid out subdivisions in 1925 with beautiful concrete boulevards over which the crowding thickets already arched . . . . There were Red Granges , Sergeant Yorks , Gertrude Eder/es , John Thomas Scopeses , Clarence Chamberlins , living more or less inconspicuously with their memories of front-page headlines or ticker-tape welcomes . But it is more interesting , as we look back at 1929 from 1937 , to glance at the slender beginnings of streams of influence or of popular excitement which were later to swell to turbulence . On September 3 , 1929 , for example , Freeman Gosden and Charles J. Correll were taking a day off for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Amos ' n ' Andy . " Until August they had had only a local audience for their broadcasts from station WMAQ in Chicago ; and even now that they were under contract at one hundred thousand dollars a year to be heard over the N.B.C . network , their program still came on at 11 o'clock Eastern Standard Time . The change to the 7 o'clock hour was still two months in the future , their phenomenal popularity was still in embryo . Did they imagine , one wonders , that by the following summer one would hardly be able to walk a block in an American town during the Amos ' n ' Andy quarter-hour without hearing their voices issuing from open window after window ? That same day , Garnet Carter of Lookout Mountain , Tennessee , boarded a train to Miami to install in the Royal Palm Park the first Tom Thumb golf course in Florida . Some years earlier , Mr. Carter had built a miniature course by his hotel at Lookout Mountain , on the outskirts of Chattanooga . He had intended it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even better . He decided that the game might have wider possibilities . In 1929 he found that two men in New York named I.edhetter and Delanoy had been building courses something like his for indoor play ; he found that another man named Robert McCart , Jr. , of El Paso , had patented the use of cottonseed hulls for putting greens ; and thereupon he made arrangements with these other men which would give him the right to go ahead and promote the new game , cottonseed-hull greens and all . And now he was climbing aboard a train for Florida to begin his campaign in a land where people could play outdoor games all winter . Did he guess that within a year the highways of America would be lined with miniature golf courses ? Walt Disney had been producing Mickey Mouse pictures for a year or so , and had just brought out his first Silly Symphony , but not yet could he be sure that his years of bitter discouragement and want were quite over ; the new pictures were going well , but his reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Pigs " and the Big Bad Wolf were still hidden by the fogs ahead . . . . At the Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff , Arizona , astronomers were engaged in the routine of searching for a planet whose discovery at the outer edge of the solar system had long been mathematically predicted . It was discouraging work , for the search had been going on intermittently at Flagstaff since 1905 . On September 3rd , Clyde W. Tombaugh of the Observatory staff was oiling the driving clock of the 13-inch telescope , making out a series of observational notes , arranging the supply of plates in preparation for a fortnight 's work of photographing a region of the sky where the supposed planet might be found . He could not know that this particular fortnight 's search would be fruitless but that within five months they would at last hit upon the right region of the sky , and that the triumphant discovery of the planet Pluto by Dr. Tombaugh would be acclaimed as the most exciting astronomical event of the year 1930 . . . . At Cazenovia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the third of September working about his farm and looking after some building that was going on there ; in the later hours of the afternoon and throughout most of the evening he was writing ? writing a passage in the first part of the second chapter of a huge novel which would not be ready for publication for nearly four years . He was Hervey Allen , and the book was Anthony Adverse . . . . In the city of Long Beach , California , there was an elderly practicing physician named Francis E. Townsend . He was quite unknown save to his patients and personal friends ; in fact , he was just as obscure as the young and none-too-successful engineer in New York , named Howard Scott , who used to talk at great length about his economic theories to any friend who would listen to him in a Greenwich Village speakeasy . Time was not ripe yet for either the Technocracy craze ( 1932-33 ) or the vogue of the Townsend Plan ( 1935-36 ) . . . . John L. Lewis had been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful member of the high command of the A. F. of L. But the Mine Workers were in a bad way , with a declining membership torn by dissension . Lewis was at odds with his own leaders , especially in Illinois , and was generally unpopular with the rank-and-file . Liberals regarded him as an autocratic reactionary , and most observers believed that his influence was waning . . . ? The man who at this time was Governor of New York was widely known ? as an engaging and popular Democratic leader and a friend and disciple of Al Smith 's . It is interesting to note that on September 3 , 1929 , Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt was awaiting replies to a questionnaire which he had just sent out to mayors and village presidents throughout New York State , asking them on what basis their communities bought electric power , whether from private companies or municipal plants , and at what cost . The action might seem to have been prophetic ; but to mortals denied the gift of prophecy it did not then seem very significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt was just collecting information which he thought he needed in order to " carry out Al Smith 's power policy . " On September 3 , 1929 , one Adolf Hitler was the leader of a growing faction in the German Republic , but few wellinformed Germans took him very seriously . George V was King of England ; and the Prince of Wales , who for some weeks had been taking flying lessons , was probably oblivious of the presence in England of young Mrs. Ernest Simpson . The average newspaper editor would have had to consult his reference library to identify Henry Morgenthau , Jr. , Alf M. Landon , or Harry Hopkins . Not in any book of reference would he have found Joe Louis , Rockefeller Center , Bruno Richard Hauptmann , Donald Budge , or the C.I.O. In all the country there was no such thing as a streamlined train , a bar operating openly and legally , or a New Dealer . And Shirley Temple was a baby less than five months old . V Innumerable are the currents in the stream of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current in himself . It may be that you yourself sat down on September 3 , 1929 , to write a letter to a relative or friend and tell what was happening . Unless you were a very exceptional letter-writer you probably did not mention Hoover or Ramsay MacDonald or Bobby Jones or the economic situation . All these things were pretty well outside the current to which your main attention was given . Perhaps you reported that you had decided to stay at the Beach and get in some more tennis before beginning your Freshman year at Ohio State ; or that you were trying to persuade your daughter that she was spoiling your grandchildren ; or that Aunt Sarah was better and had been allowed to sit out on the porch , which was a great boon to her as the second floor got terribly hot in this weather ; or that you had met Harry Jarvis this evening at Jack and Charlie 's and he was putting on weight but was as funny as ever . Trivialities ? Not to you . Not , presumably , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one narrow current of history . There are countless individual threads like these in the skein of events , and there are almost countless ways of combining them . The history of each business concern is a combination of them ; so is that of each community , each professional group , each art , each sport , each industry . If you were to ask a Chicago politician what he was doing on September 3 , 1929 , the best way of placing the date in his memory might be to remind him that it was the day when ex-Mayor Dever died . That event in his own particular stream of history might have been more vital to him than anything I have mentioned heretofore To an Idaho lumberman September 3rd might be that anxious Tuesday when the forest fires were sweeping so near ; to a racing enthusiast , the day when The Nut won the Hourless Handicap at Belmont Park and became the leading contender for the Lawrence Realization ; to a chemist , the day when he made up his mind to go to Minneapolis after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Bonhoeffer was to read his paper on dividing hydrogen into parahydrogen and ortho-hydrogen . When a man sits down to write a history of American railroading or of the city of Schenectady or of California poetry , he combines some of these threads ; and at once the question begins to perplex him : What events , what tendencies shall he include , and what weight shall he give to each of them ? To some extent each decision he makes will naturally depend upon the number of people who are affected by these events or tendencies . The forest fires in Idaho , for example , clearly affect more people than his Aunt Sarah 's ability to sit out on the porch . To some extent his decision will depend upon the duration of the effect : those fires may exert an influence upon lumbering practice in Idaho or upon the behavior of Idaho rivers long after The Nut has been put out to graze away its old age on a farm . What the historian tries to arrive at is a sort of common denominator of our collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their long-range significance . But always there is guesswork in his decisions , They will vary with his individual prejudices , opinions , areas of knowledge and of ignorance . To a Communist , September 3 , 1929 , may appear to be the day when American capitalism began its last ( or next-to-last ) decline toward permanent collapse . To a conservative Republican , it may appear to be the day when a decline began that was prompted by speculative over-enthusiasm , accelerated by European panic resulting from the war , and prolonged by economic quackery on the part of the Democrats . Again , the historian 's guesses will vary with the moment at which they are made . It is nearly two years , now , since I first thought of writing the article which you are now reading . At that time I made a rough draft of the passage about the Graf Zeppelin . I wrote that " since 1930 no lighter-than-air ship except the Graf Zeppelin itself has crossed the North Atlantic . " A few weeks later I read that a new Zeppelin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1936 ? and I realized that before long the aspect of things might be considerably changed . The Graf Zeppelin 's successful flight in 1929 might soon be looked back at , not as a false dawn of an era of transatlantic flight in dirigibles , but as a real though premature dawn . I revised my draft accordingly . The Hindenburg came , made a whole series of successful routine flights , and apparently confirmed the wisdom of my revision . Meanwhile I had laid my text aside , unpublished . Then came the Hindenburg disaster ? and once more the apparent relative significance of the two aviation events of September 3 , 1929 , made another abrupt change . Who knows to-day how those two events will look to the historian of 1950 ? or of 2000 ? Who knows , for that matter , how the passage which I have written about the status of John L. Lewis will look in later years ? If you should happen to read this article in a bound volume of HARPER 'S in 1950 , will you wonder why I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or will you wonder why I was not bright enough to give him a full page ? ( In case you feel quite sure of what the answer will be , write it down now , save it till 1950 , and then compare your foresight with , let us say , that of Mr. Hoover and his aides in 1929 . ) These are small examples , but characteristic , of the way in which new events bring about constant changes in our judgment of past events . The changes never cease . People speak glibly of the " verdict of history " as if it ever became unanimous or certain . It does not . How great was Karl Marx ? And what caused the fall of Rome ? Yet at leiSt the passage of time helps to make our guesses less difficult . Nobody writing an American history in 1937 would suggest that the differences of opinion over the Republican tariff bill in September , 1929 , were more important than what was happening on the New York Stock Exchange . Nobody who has witnessed the economic changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes which they have precipitated , can well deny that it was a great divide over which we unwittingly passed on that hot Tuesday in early September . Gradually the evidence accumulates , and we begin to get a clearer notion of the size and shape of the building blocks out of which the structure of history is made . Even now , though , the evidence is not all in . Who knows but that to our children 's children the third of September , 1929 , may be remembered chiefly as the birthday of some boy now in the third grade ?
