First thing anyone learns about plump , suave Dr. H. H. Kung , Vice President and Finance Minister of China , is that he is the 75th direct descendant of Confucius . <P> A more useful family connection , however , is Dr. Kung 's wife , eldest of the three famed Soong girls who with their brother have long been the real power behind the Nanking Government . By marrying Ailing ( " Pleasant " ) Soong , smart Dr. Kung became brother-in-law at one crack of China 's late , sainted Dr. Sun Yatsen , President Chiang Kai-shek and Finance Minster T. V. Soong . It was logical in 1933 when T. V. Soong quarreled with Chiang that Dr. Kung should succeed to his job . Regarded then as second-rate compared to brilliant " T. V. " , Dr. Kung has since done a whacking good job , currently sits high at China 's council tables . When Chiang was kidnapped last winter , Dr. Kung became acting President , ran the country through that highly explosive situation with a minimum of trouble . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coronation of George VI . <P> This ceremonial visit served as an excellent curtain for a tremendous amount of dickering with European bigwigs . Swinging through Germany , Austria , Switzerland , Czechoslovakia , Italy , France and Belgium , Dr. Kung was everywhere given the sort of excessively cordial reception he loves . This was because China 's credit is better now than it has been for years and because Europe , notably Germany , desperately needs a market for exports . China 's credit is currently high because Dr. Kung has begun to make good on a number of defaulted foreign loans , promises to take care of them all . Hitler , Gring and Dr. Schacht therefore licked their chops when he arrived in Berlin . They gave him an honorary degree , got an unnamed industrialist to cough up 100,000 Reichsmarks for Chinese students to visit Germany , finally hinted that Germany would love to export machinery and other goods to China if Dr. Kung would float another international loan to pay for them . But wily Dr. Kung shattered their hopes by saying that China has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in commercial credits . Then he left for the U. S. where last week he speedily made a deal .
