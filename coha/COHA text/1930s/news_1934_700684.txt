Scotts than they are willing to pay . The segregation formula goes into the most elaborate detail . It even provides for the division of profits on a lunch wadon which happens to be located at the point on the line which divides the two mortgages . The report . however , covers only January . It shows that there was a balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott 's . Assuming January was an average month , earnings for the year would be $3,120,000 , against interest charges of $1.900,520 on the $25,835,000 outstanding and $21,678,000 pleaged under the prior liens .
