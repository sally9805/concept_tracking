In a huff last autumn . Professor Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague resigned as money adviser to the Treasury . Since then he has returned to his chair at the Harvard Business School , has been retained as foreign exchange and trade adviser to General Motors Export Co. and has attempted to create " an aroused and organized public opinion , " which he said was the only " defense from a drift into unrestrained inflation . " Most conservative businessmen regarded him as their best friend and stoutest ally . Last week they were shocked and startled when Professor Sprague turned around and let fly at them because they " were not ready to take risks . " <P> " I am not nearly as critical of the Administration as I am of a large proportion of the business executives of this country , " said Dr. Sprague . " When businessmen go to Washington they talk of unfair competition and chiselers . They are too greedy and magnify their own difficulties and interests . . . . <P> " We will get out of this depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprising in the next year , even in spite of the faulty policies of the NRA and the CWA , to absorb an increasing number of unemployed wage earners . After all , unemployment is the result of errors in judgment made by ourselves , the directing classes . . . . <P> " Business should strive to secure larger volume and more stable profits instead of attempting to raise the price level . . . . A choice must be made between the retention of a considerable amount of competition . . . or a very large measure of Government control . If we have a recession again such as we had last September and October , there is no doubt that our rulers will ask for even more extensive powers . "
