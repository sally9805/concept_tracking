Last week a U. S. magazine of ripe years and rich reputation came to an end in all but name when Life was purchased by TIME Inc . With its November issue now on the presses , that civilized funsheet will , after 53 years , cease to function as the good-humored critic , the caustic commentator on the U. S. scene , will pass into the realm of great things gone forever . <P> From its journalistic grave TIME is saving only Life 's worthy name , to be conferred as a birthday present upon TIME 'S forth coming newspicture magazine . First issue of the new LIFE will be in subscribers ' hands by Nov. 19 . Life 's staff will be taken over by TIME Inc. intact . Only Life activity to be continued by TIME Inc . <P> is its Fresh Air Fund for providing slum children with country outings . <P> Life was born in 1883 as a weekly in the Broadway studio of a New York artist named John Ames Mitchell . Thirty-seven at the time , Mitchell pined to publish his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that purpose was willing to spend a $10,000 legacy from a relative . <P> Level-headed Publisher Henry Holt told Artist Mitchell that Life 's life would be short , advised him to stay out of a field in which Judge and Puck were already established . Single-minded Publisher Mitchell went ahead with his plans , engaged as literary editor a young man named Edward Sandford Martin . Six years out of Harvard , where he was a founder of the Lampoon , Martin had the definite idea that that college comic could be transmuted into a professional periodical . <P> For Vol. 1 , No. 1 , Artist-Publisher Mitchell drew the first Life nameplate with its mascot cupids , later contributed the famed masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil . <P> Caption : " While there 's Life , there 's hope . " The new magazine set forth its principles and policies thus : " We wish to have some fun in this paper . . . . We shall try to domesticate as much as possible of the casual cheerfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . We shall have something to say about religion , about politics , fashion , society , literature , the stage , the stock exchange , and the police station , and we will speak out what is in our mind as fairly , as truthfully , and as decently as we know how . " <P> On this broad platform the infant publication immediately began to cut capers . <P> Though Editor Martin , who suffered from malaria , retired for a few years to build up his health , there was no dearth of energetic contributors . From the magazine 's point of view , most important of these was Charles Dara Gibson . To Life for $4 he sold his first contribution : A dog outside his kennel baying the moon. * Encouraged by a publisher who was also an artist , Gibson was joined in Life 's early pages by such celebrated draughtsmen as E. W. Kemble ( funny Negroes ) , Palmer ( " Brownies " ) Cox , F. G. Attwood , A. B. <P> Frost , Oliver Herford . By the time Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1885 , Life had lined up such impressive literary talent as John Kendrick Bangs , James Whitcomb Riley , Brander Matthews .
