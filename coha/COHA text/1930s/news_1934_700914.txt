txt Ourselves and King Midas . A $396,000,000 excess of exports over imports in ten months is seized upon as an occasion for some rejoicing . If the excess exports are paid for in gold or silver , it is an indication that the rest of the world has , earned to value commodities that it can consume , and that we in America have not yet grasped the moral illustrated by the story of King Midas . If the favorable balance of trade was financed by credit , it proves that we have gone Midas one worse , for Instead of converting our goodly possessions into gold , we have exchanged them for paper . That we are speeding up the process of shipping commodities out much faster than we take them in is also joyously regarded . Here I see a glimmer of intelligence , for if we are to suffer thesfate of King Midas , the more haste in consummating it the better , for the shorter will be the period of suffering during the death struggle .
