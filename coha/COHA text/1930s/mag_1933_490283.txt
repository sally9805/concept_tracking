CALVIN COOLIDGE once said that when the need is great , a leader arises . We shall presently see whether he was right , for the time is at hand . One wonders whether leadership is possible any more . The leader who has arisen locally , on the wings of the electorate , is Mayor O'Brien , a genial bullfrog croaking economy to the Board of Estimate while the pond itself slowly dries up . We attended the public meeting of the Board last week . It was the Mayor 's first appearance . Various distasteful matt e es were at hand  --  the transportation people wanted money to extend a subway , Queens wanted some money to complete a highway , Richmond wanted the city to take Mr. Hearst 's advice and Buy American , justice Kernochen was whining about his salary cut , and a pump in the water-supply department needed refueling . We happened to sit directly in front of a little man who talked , quietly , all through the meeting . He was describing to his neighbor , in low tones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : no job , getting old , no prospect of a job , machines taking his place , no money to pay interest on mortgage , unemployment increasing despite economy . He had once had a good job in the cellar of City Hall , and had just wandered into the meeting today because he had nothing better to do and it was a chance to get in out of the cold . Against this curious wispy obbligato of disaster came the large sounds of the municipal fussing  --  the overworked water-pump , the unhappy Justice , the distraught borough presidents . It seemed like a moment in history , a time for a leader . We could almost hear his voice , saying : " For a while we will hold no more meetings of the Board of Estimate ; there is n't time . " L'iVEN Coolidge , before he died , realized that things were changing fast . He said he felt out of key . He admitted that the public servant of the future would have to get hold of a new point of view and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of his last hours . He went to the office early , but there was n't much to do . It made him restless , nothing much to do . In the middle of the morning he came home , and there was n't much to do there either . He talked for a while with his secretary . He went down cellar and stood for a moment , watching a man put coal into the furnace . A little while later he was dead . That was all there was to it . He died a thrifty man and an idle one , in a world grown both thrifty and idle . OUR next leader , if one , will have to freed of Vermont , a fisherman w ho has taken off his stiff collar . Big roads run out of Vermont , and that is the point . Piety , frugality , keeping one 's house in order , are still primary personal virtues , but they apparently have become secondary social ones . The leader who arises now will have to be frugal in affairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway : we will probably get him for parking too long in front of the wilderness , or for neglecting to file a personal-property tax in the Promised Land . ' THERE is no dearth of potential THER but they are having a tough time getting going . One difficulty is that they hate each other so . Economist makes nasty faces at Technocrat . Technocrat thumbs nose at financier . Financier pouts at Communist , Communist at Socialist , Socialist at the League for Independent Political Action . God only knows what the president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce thinks about the secretary of the North Side Democratic Club of Flatbush , but he probably thinks something . The trouble with the present reaching-out toward a collective form of society is that nowadays a leader would rather he a Socialist then right . Or a Communist . Or a Capitalist . Maybe we ought to form a bowling club , so we could get to know each other . PROBABLY the man who understands all these matters better than most , and who knows the peculiar weakness of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He charges ten cents for a look at the tip of the Empire State Building , and only five cents for a look at Vega , star of the first magni-tude . The tip of the building , being not far away , is pleasantly compre-hensible to his cus-tomers . Vega , be-ing three times as remote as Sirius , merely gives them a feeling of cosmic despondency , a dizzy , uneasy moment in West Forty-second Street . They find it more comforting to pay five cents more , and not sec so far . Fiduciary MHE other morning we swaggered 1 into the Guaranty Trust Company 's Fifth Avenue branch to tell them a little joke . We had discovered in the phone book a firm called the Guarantee Truss Company , and we thought that the hankers might he amused to hear about it . It seems we were too late . About a year ago an Italian had appeared at the bank with his wife ; the two of them stood square in the middle of the marble hall looking about nervously . An officer stepped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , he say I got ta have truss . " " What kind of a trust ? " asked the officer . " Forty-inch . Not too expens ' . " THIS reminiscence reminded the Guaranty of another little joke , and we stayed around while they told it . When the Shah of Persia died , the Guaranty found itself handling the estate . It was no mean assignment . The Shah had named six wives , and a couple of unnamed ones turned up for good measure . A technicality arose when somebody invoked a law of Persia to show that the Guaranty Trust was n't fit to administer the Shah 's estate , because a Christian could n't be the executor for a lIussulman . So the Guaranty had to go to court and prove that it was n't Christian . Did n't even say its prayers at night . One in Fifty AGENTLEMAN wreathed in sad vapors has just taught us a new game  --  which he plays to take his mind off life . It is a game of fancy , for men only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea is this from among the next fifty ladies whom you pass while strolling , one is to be chosen who shall accompany you to a desert isle . You simply start counting " One , two , three . . . " as the ladies come along , always hearing in mind that the time is getting short , and that your island mate must be found before you get to fifty . Otherwise the fiftieth lady goes with you , even though her face might kill all the trees on the place . The difficulty of the game is the shortness of time for a decision . It is against the rules to turn around and look hack at anybody . The player must decide instantly whether he is to cast his lot in with , say , No. 22 , who is passable but no ball-of-fire ; or whether he dares wait it out , in the hope that the perfect island maiden will dart out of a doorway in time for the fiftieth count . Certain sections of town are better than others for this game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never play it on the side streets between Broadway and Sixth . There is , of course , no reward except a spiritual one ; and it is like solitaire in that nobody except yourself knows whether you 've won . Sometimes even you do n't know . A djustment BEFORE we forget it , there was a funny thing that happened at that Board of Estimate meeting last week . When Mr. O'Brien plopped himself down , flushed and smiling , in the big leather chair , it was apparent that the chair was too far away from the desk for comfort . Promptly two husky attendants picked the Mayor up , chair and all , and set him down where he belonged , close enough to do business . IJ ES ' HONOR was a strange contrast to Jimmy Walker , whose thin ghost still hangs around such gatherings . We had often watched the great Walker skimming lightly through the blooming fields of municipal minutiae , never missing a daisy , and it used to he a pleasure to note his butterfly flight in the days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose monument is a 95,000-word decision in the Erlanger-Pixel case , is considerably heavier in action . He seemed dai.ed in the presence of subway extension and highway finance , like a schoolboy who did n't understand what was on the blackboard . Seated between Mr. Mahon and Mr. Berry , he had his hand held by two or three technicians who hovered about in the rear . Only in the larger , more general matters , such as his ringing pronouncement in favor of strict economy , did he seem to he sure of himself . Then his voice rang forth , and he became very , very severe . The rest of the time , he was listening to whatever was being whispered into his ear by his contemporaries . It is really not possible to report accurately a meeting of the Board of Estimate , because the microphones are placed wrong . They amplify the secretary , calling the roll on motions , but do not amplify the persons standing behind the Mayor 's chair , prompting . Once Mr. O'Brien became rattled when he forgot what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the motion to .. ? the mutton to . . . " He paused , unable to think what it was , and his head fell hack and his eyes popped grievously . But for the most part he kept step , gave careful attention to Senators and small petitioners , scowled at all attempts to pilfer the public funds , and seemed anxious to get on to things and to he a good mayor , if he could figure out how . Be Kind to Animals MRAVELLERS sojourning in Ma-1 jorca are shocked to find that the natives are almost never known to if treat animals with any gentleness . They pluck chickens alive because the feathers come nut easier that way , they give pigeons to their little children to play with , and they are mean to rabbits and pigs . Greatly disturbed 11 a long succession of distressing scenes , an American lady who had been several weeks resident in one of the villages there called upon the local mayor to protest and to explain the general idea of prevention of cruelty to animals . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the idea . The lady explained again , slowly and in detail , but what with the limitations of her Spanish and the strangeness of her notion , he was even more bewildered . He gathered , however , that she was talking about something having to do with the American tourists and the suffering of animals and he pondered the matter deeply . Finally his eyes lighted up . " Ail , Senora , " he cried , " I have it ! We shall have a bullfight . " Fish DR . NORBERT L. LEDERER lives in a roomy apartment in the West Seventies with his wife , two thousand tropical fish , a canary , two bulldogs , and a Galapagos turtle . He has the largest private collection of fish in town . Dr. Lederer ( he 's a Ph.D. , University of Vienna ) keeps his fish in fourteen tanks , the biggest of which holds thirty gallons . This one is in the living-room ; the others are in the bathroom , his study , his bedroom , and so on . Dr. Lederer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried shrimps , at noon tuhifexes ( tiny water worms ) . He wears a blue dressing-gown when he feeds them , and whenever they see him in this , they rush to the surface with their mouths open ; when he takes the gown off , they do n't know who he is and treat him coldly . Sundays he feeds them daphnias ( small crustaceans ) ; daphnias are expensive  --  his fish cat fifty cents ' worth in ten minutes . The Doctor is the only person who ever succeeded in raising piranhas in captivity . Piranhas are gangster fish and live in the Amazon . They can reduce a horse to a skeleton in five minutes by ganging him , if he is unlucky enough to fall into the Amazon . Dr. Lederer feeds them his surplus guppys , of which he has a lot ( one of his lady guppys had a hundred and sixty-seven young one night ) . His surplus of rarer fish he sells to the Aquarium Stock Company on Chambers Street . He gets from eighty to a hundred dollars a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . His rarest fish is the Metynnis Roosevelti , which was named after the better-off of the two most famous Roosevelts , who got them in the Amazon on one of his trips . ' They cost thirty dollars each , and are hard to keep alive . There probably are n't six pair in private hands in the country . Dr. Lederer got his in Hamburg , which is the world 's clearing house for tropical fish . He has sixty kinds of fish in all , including Indian glassfish , which arc so transparent you can see their internal organs , and Siamese Fighters , which have lungs instead of gills , and have to come to the surface for air or they would drown . Dr. Lederer is n't fifty yet . His father was in the consular service and he lived in Vienna from the age of eight to twenty-one . His pets there included a hedgehog , two hawks , an alligator , ten dogs , some newts , and a pair of Moroccan jumping mice . Later he lived in London and Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interests . He is president of the Lederer Glue Company and has his office , like his hobbies , in his home . He is treasurer of the Authors Club and writes about fish for fish periodicals  --  mainly about diseases of tropical ones , for many of which he discovered cures . He also writes on European murders , they being another of his hobbies . He is doing a book on bridge now . He gave S. S. Van Dine the chess and mathematical dope for " The Bishop Murder Case , " also dope for other Van Dine mysteries . His library on criminology is one of the best in the country . Newspapers sometimes , during big murder stories , ask him for his opinion . His friends send him clippings of all good murders in remote places . He referees many important chess tournaments , was a major in the war , and has a fine collection of revolvers , bayonets , gas masks , and helmets . He likes going to concerts and playing his Victrola . He has five thousand phonograph records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . orchidaceous ALTHOALTHOUGH our major efforts UGH have always been devoted to rubber plants , we are thinking some of try int to grow orchids . There is an outfit called the Orchid Guild of America which is trying to introduce orchids into the home . ( Incidentally , Peggy Joyce now has a home herself . ) Membership in the Guild is for life . It costs one hundred dollars , and for that you receive twelve orchid plants , guaranteed to bloom in rotation the year round . That is , every month one of the plants will produce . You also get the right to vote at the annual meeting . The Guild has a conservatory in New Rochelle and an office on 42nd Street . We phoned thorn and asked whether it was really feasible to grow orchids in a New York apartment and they assured us it was . The only catch is that one must have a case built for them  --  a sort of miniature greenhouse , to maintain decent temperature and humidity during the more rigorous moments of a steam heated and debauched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly hardy , but they do n't do business till they are seven years old . They are not rooted in soil , but derive their life and looks from twisting themselves around a fern . The Guild supplies only mature plants . They come in six or eight varieties , and the Guild even arranges to hoard them while the owner is away on vacation . The whole thing sounds inviting ; all we nerd is the hundred dollars , and permission from our rubber plant . Advanced AA MOTHER setting about enter-ing her five-year-old daughter in one of the advanced-method schools presented the child , according to instructions , for a psychology test . In the course of this , the examiner , an owlish lady , asked , " Arc you a boy or a girl ? " The little girl regarded her steadily for a moment and said , " Boy . " The examiner looked very grave indeed through all the rest of the test , and when it was done drew the mother aside and said that all sorts of development difficulties threatened . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's confusion about her sex was ominous . The mother was naturally pretty much upset . Driving home , she asked her daughter why she had told the lady she was a boy . " Aw , " said the little girl , " when a person asks you a dumb question , it 's all right to give a dumb answer . " The Election TA ST week was an unusually active one for us  --  we even managed to get to the meeting of the Electoral Col lege at Albany . The first session was held in the Executive Chamber in the Capitol . Everybody was rather jolly , in a slightly embarrassed way , Forty-seven chairs were ranged in front of a huge , hat-topped desk . On a smaller desk beside it stood a galvanized-iron can with a slit in its top and a paper pasted on its side reading : " New York State Electoral College 1933 . " A little after noon the room was filled with electors . Electors are usually chosen from two groups : office-holders and others active in politics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the more prominent electors this year were the Messrs . Curry , McCooey , Farley , Olvany , and Herman Baruch . Among the smaller fry were Mayor Otto of New Rochelle , a Clifton Bogardus of Brooklyn , a Seymour Van Santvoord of Rensselaer , a Frederick Kroll of Niagara Falls , and so on up to forty-seven . There were five women , including Mrs. George Gordon Battle . Electors get no pay , but they do get liberal expense allowances , which this year they turned over to Mr. Roosevelt 's Warm Springs Foundation . Elector Edward J. Flynn called the College to order . There were a few photographers and reporters on hand and about twenty eighth-grade schoolchildren from Troy whose teachers had brought them over to see the government working its little mysteries . A bishop invoked divine blessing and then the roll was called . Only one elector was missing : George W. Loft , the candy-man . Mr. Flynn made quite a long speech , pointing out that in the event the President-elect had died , the Electoral College would then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien was made Temporary President ( of the College , not the country ) . Electors Hardy of Oneida and Dapping of Cayuga were then appointed to escort him to the big desk . It was then announced that Mr. Loft had wired that he could n't make it . A gray-haired lady from Syracuse was elected to his place . Then Elector Farley was elected Permanent President . He rated three electors as an escort . The Temporary President made a little speech , gave the Permanent President his gavel , and went back and sat down . The schoolchildren stirred restlessly . President Farley made a speech , and then Elector Flynn invited the whole College out to lunch . Elector Olvany moved that the invitation be accepted . This was seconded and adopted . Elector Godfrey Nurse , a Negro , moved for a recess until three o'clock . The afternoon meeting was held in the Senate Chamber , starting at three-twenty . The school-children were on hand again , in the gallery , and about a hundred other people drifted in . Mr. Farley began by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he had already come to a decision in his own mind but would listen to arguments . There were no arguments . Roosevelt and Garner were elected and Hoover 's last chalice was gone , and ours too , probably , we reflected . The electors filed by the hallot can and dropped in their votes . Mr. Farley then said , " The tellers will please announce the results . " The school-children showed some interest here , The tellers , however , did n't open the can and count the votes . One of them simply said , " Forty-seven votes for Franklin D. Roosevelt for President of the United States . " The children seemed disappointed . The rigmarole was gone through for Garner , and then a wire was read from Roosevelt saying he wished he was there . Resolutions were passed to wire congratulations to the two lucky candidates and to communicate the results of the balloting to the President of the Senate in the prescribed manner : one copy by mail and another by messenger . Each elector then signed no fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elector Van Santvoord now moved that ever-body pay a call on Governor Lehman and off they went for the Executive Mansion , vowing that they had never had a better time and certainly would come hack again in I937 . The children started off for Troy . Hollywood Item THE old-school spaciousness still persists in Hollywood , at any rate . A big executive out there wanted to see the picture " Maedclien in Uniform " when it opened at a Los Angeles theatre ( for the purpose of deciding whether to do it over with an American cast , in English , for the popular-movie trade ) . He was too busy to get down to the theatre , so he had the manager on the phone , explained the situation , and asked to have the film sent to his home so he could run it off in his own projection-room . The manager , happy to oblige , said he would send it out as soon as the showing was completed ; along about eleven o'clock , that would be . The executive said he did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what else he could do . The executive said he knew what he could do . He could send over a fleet of fast automobiles from his studio and have the film hurried to his house , reel by reel , as fast as it was run at the theatre . He did , and as soon as the first reel was completed , it was rushed to an automobile , tossed in , and hurtled through the California night . Before it got to its destination , the second was on its way , and so on , through ten reels . Travellers AN N advertising agency has a policy -I of encouraging ideas from any and all members of the staff , thinking to leave no grain unturned . They get some odd suggestions , of course , but now and then a good one bobs up , from a telephone girl maybe . Early the other morning , John , one of the older officeboys , burst in upon one of ? the heads of the business bubbling with a swell idea . You make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and a girl on a honeymoon trip . " To Hot Springs , " John explained . The other shows " two people on their way to Reno to get a divorce . " John 's boss nodded and said it certainly was interesting and undoubtedly could be made quite striking . But what , he wanted to know , would it advertise ? The officeboy looked at him rather pityingly . " Trains , " he said , explaining the obvious . THE NEW YORKER 15 " T HAD just returned from that trip I was telling you about ( I shall make no attempt to do . this in dialect , if you do n't mind ) when we had had that little trouble with the Albatross , and I was naturally a bit jumpy . Jumpy and pretty sore at albatrosses . As a general thing I like animals , hut this one had gone too far . So I set about thinking as to how I could get back at one . I am more the vindictive type , in case it interests you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut go ahead . " " Well , I figured it out and I figured it out , and pretty soon I says to my-self ? " " I thought you were n't going to do this in dialect , " I interrupted . " What kind of talk is ' I says to my-self ' ? " " Sorry . So I said to myself : ' Why must it be that a dead albatross brings bad luck to sailors ? Why could n't a dead sailor bring bad luck to an albatross ? Why could n't a sailor dog an albatross all over the world , daring him to take a shot and finally driving him crazy ? ' It seemed like THREE a good idea for a way to avenge my mates , and , being a man of few words , I set about doing it . " First , I had to find an albat-ross . We were in port at Salem at the time , so I goes so I went , par-don me  --  down to Boston , where I heard there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who looked as if he might be fun to worry . ' Shall I wrap him up to take out , or will you eat him here ? ' the man asked me . " ' I do n't want him at all , ' I said . Just turn him loose and give him five minutes ' head-start . ' " So the man turned the albatross loose , and as he started out , I yelled at him : ' You 're laughing now , you son of a sea-cook ? " ' " No nautical slang , if you please , " I said . " Remember , you promised . " " Oke , " said the Ancient Mariner , blushing furiously . " Well , anyway , I gave him a pretty nasty sendoff and told him I 'd be seeing him . Then I got into a little Moth plane I had hired for the occasion and started out after " He set out for Brazil , with me just behind him . Once I caught up with him close enough to yell : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following you ! ' " " ' I heard different ! ' he yells back , but I could see that he was nervous . He tried to cut across to the sea , but I was right there behind him , jeering and pointing my finger at him , so he turned back inland and started flying low across to Peru . I had brought along a watchman 's rattle and some of those rubber Bronx-cheer things , which I kept blowing at him until he was pretty near crazy . " Then I drew up on him again and yelled : ' You do n't dare shoot me  --  you do n't dare shoot me ? ' fraidy cat'fraidy cat ! ' and he began biting his under lip and trying not to hear . By this time we were well out over the Pacific and he was in a rage . " He came down at New Zealand and I made a pretty landing , just clipping his tail . " ' Look here , sailor , ' he said . ' I can stand just so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll shoot you down , so help me Louis Agassiz . ' " ' Go ahead and shoot , you old albatross you , ' I said . ' But you know what happens if you shoot a sailor that 's following you , do n't you ? ' " ' In some states you get a bounty , ' he said , trying to be flip . " ' All right , buddie , ' I said . Go ahead and get your bounty , if you do n't care how you make your money . But you wo n't be in very good shape to enjoy it , ' I said . And I made a face like a dead albatross , which frightened him  --  and frightened me a little , too . " ILIFTED the A Ancient Mariner 's beard from off his lap and held it up to his chin . " Beards on ! " I said . " Your four minutes are up , and you are                 @ @ @ @
