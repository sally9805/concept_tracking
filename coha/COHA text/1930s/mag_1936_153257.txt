For many years at his country home at Lake Hopatcong , N. J. Funnyman Joe Cook has been assembling at great expense safety pins , collar buttons , unset stones , Japanese netsukes , miniature bibles , bathtub faucets , tin soldiers , perfume bottles , ball bearings , for his celebrated collection of objects ' ' no larger than a man 's hand . " An object which qualified for the Cook collection appeared in New York 's art mart last week , a 16th Century portrait four and one-half inches in diameter . Comedian Cook is an unlikely purchaser , however , for the picture is the only authenticated self-portrait in oils of Hans Holbein the Younger , was last valued at $100,000 and is held for much more than that by the firm of Elkan &; Abraham Silberman . <P> The name Holbein in the Anglo-Saxon world immediately suggests the chunky , bearded younger Hans , favorite portraitist of Henry VIII and immortalizer of Tudor aristocracy . Actually there were four famed German Holbeins : Hans the father , Uncle Sigismund , Brothers Hans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left a deep mark on the history of painting if young Hans had never thought of going to England . <P> As an apprentice in Basle young Holbein found a friend and patron in the great Theologian Erasmus whom he painted many times . The younger Holbein made a name for himself in Basle . Came the depression of the 1520 's , however , and Erasmus sent him packing off to England with a letter of introduction to Sir Thomas More ( Utopia ) . Holbein 's first series of English portraits were not of court celebrities but of the scholars of More 's circle . <P> Back in Switzerland in 1528 he swanked it about Basle in furs and velvets , bought a fine house for his wife and family , then returned to England in 1530 . As far as is known it was the Tudor tycoon Thomas Cromwell ( whose portrait by Holbein now hangs in Manhattan 's Frick Gallery ) who first introduced this skillful German to bluff King Hal . Henry took to Holbein immediately , made him his court painter in 1537 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paint a reportorial portrait of Anne of Cleves whom Henry was thinking of making his fourth wife . <P> In 1542 Hans Holbein took time off from his royal work to find a piece of board no bigger than a man 's hand , paint his own picture on it to send to his family in Basle . Year later he died of the plague in London . <P> The little self-portrait remained in the Holbein family for generations , was not known to the world of art until 1930 when Art Expert Dr. Paul Ganz cleaned it , published its photograph in a magazine . Since then museums and private collectors in a dozen countries have been anxious for it . The only other absolutely authentic Holbein self-portrait is a watercolor in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence .
