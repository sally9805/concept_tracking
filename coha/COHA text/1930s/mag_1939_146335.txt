( See Cover <P> Behind the creamy buff walls of the rambling Munitions Building on Washington 's Constitution Avenue he finds life as he likes it . He strides down the long halls and nobody pays attention . Officers in mufti scarcely glance at his tall , lean figure , a trifle stooped ; preoccupied clerks with sheaves of papers do not even look up as he goes past . In the Air Corps section on the third floor he waves a hand at flier friends , flashes a white-toothed grin , heads for his office . Hour after hour he sits earnestly in an endless succession of technical conferences , usually breaks the day to lunch with a friend or two at the staid Army &; Navy Club . There , too , nobody pays attention to him . <P> To Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh , digging into a job he knows and loves , this is pretty near heaven . But it is not heaven . In heaven there would be no autograph hunters , newspaper reporters and jumping-jack photographers lurking around the corners . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from a distance . There would be no need for an armed guard around the Morrow estate in Englewood , N. J. where his wife and two sons live . And in heaven he would not have to endure his own unyielding but logical resentment against it all . <P> For twelve years Charles Lindbergh has been a hero , and twelve years is too much . Today , however , it is almost certain that his relationship with the world is coming to a turning point . There is the possibility that by staying in the U. S.-where he wants to live-he may get the public to stop persecuting him as a hero . Although he is willing to try it , he is grimly dubious of the result . There is no cynicism in his still boyish makeup , but with the logic of a pragmatic mind he has dovetailed his experiences of the past twelve years into a picture as discouraging to him as the sound of a missing engine to a pilot in bad weather . For the fact is that the relation of Charles Lindbergh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against the institution of hero worship . <P> There has been no time when Lindbergh and the public ever fully understood each other . The supreme irony is that if they had understood , there would have been no difficulty . Lindbergh is a kind of man whom Americans instinctively appreciate and like : practical and resourceful , with a mechanical turn of mind , an extraordinary competence in his business , full of animal spirits , empty of all pretension , built around a steel-tough core of reserve and self-respect . <P> To most of the public Charles Lindbergh did not exist until one May day in 1927 when he was flying the North Atlantic . By the time he set foot again in the U. S. three weeks later the public had not stopped to consider what the son of a radical Congressman from Minnesota , and of a high-school chemistry teacher , was probably like . It had made up its mind that Lindbergh was a sort of automaton of modesty , a creature , boyish and noble , of heroic stature .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
