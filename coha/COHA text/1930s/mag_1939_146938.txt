Saliva <P> Sirs : <P> Your come-back to A. C. Whitaker 's letter ( TIME , Dec. 4 ) " Saliva is saliva , distilled or not-ED. " is the most inept and unsnappy that I can recall . In fact I might say it was positively dumb . What Mr. Whitaker tried to tell you in a nice way was that the moisture that accumulates in musicians ' wind instruments was not spit but actual water , and he was right . . . . <P> Take a piece of toast hot from the toaster tomorrow morning and lay it on a cold plate . When you pick it up you will note the plate is beaded with drops of moisture . And it wo n't be saliva . . . . The air the musician takes into his lungs is not saturated with saliva when he blows it into his horn , it is warmed in the lungs so that its natural moisture is more easily condensed when it passes into the cooler metal coils of the horn , and this natural moisture of the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has to be dumped out . <P> E. M. KRUSEN Drexel Hill , Pa . <P> Sirs : <P> Millions of amateur distillers from the prohibition era will join me in agreeing with A. C. Whitaker ( TIME , Dec. 4 ) , against the editor , that the juice from a French horn is condensed hot air , and not a product of the salivary glands . <P> HOWARD B. POTTS Byesville , O. <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Saliva consists of that liquid derived from the three pair of salivary glands proximate and discharging into the mouth . The fluid substance removable after the playing of wind instruments consists mainly of condensed exhaled breath whose source is the lungs . <P> You have a good Department of Medicine - why not use it for pertinent consultations ? <P> VICTOR G. RUBENSTEIN , M.D. Los Angeles , Calif . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . The lungs normally excrete almost a quart of water a day , roughly 1% ounces an hour . Horn playing is not normal breathing , and in two hours ' playing time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glassful of water from the lungs , sir , not spit ! <P> MARY STEICHEN , M.D. Bellevue Hospital New York City <P> Sirs : . . .

Did he leave it " somewhere in France , " or has trick Hollywood photography been used on us poor fans all these years ? <P> MRS . LEVIS HALL JR .
