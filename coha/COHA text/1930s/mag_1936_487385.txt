Dear Sirs : I think that the editorial " ' Peace ' and the C. I. 0 . " in The Nation of November 7 is a very fine analysis of the whole problem it concerns . JOHN L. LEWIS Washington , November 14 Dear Sns : The Nation of November 7 carried a leading editorial on the peace moves in the A. F. of L. ? C. I. 0 . controversy , charging me with unreliable reporting and warning readers that my stories in the New York Times on this question are not to be trusted . The argument you set up is founded upon distortions , misrepresentations , and downright suppression of fact . The record and documentary evidence available are against you . While professing to desire peace in the labor movement , you seek to throw discredit upon the genuineness and sincerity of the peace moves and upon labor leaders involved , as part of your other objective of impugning my reportorial integrity and accuracy . According to your version , I first sighted " the dove of peace " at a luncheon attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval . You add that later I reported how Max Zaritsky , at the convention of his organization , " pulled the bird of peace out of a hat , " as you put it . The fact that the luncheon in question was attended by an audience of representative labor men on both sides of the C. I. 0 . controversy and by others of influence and importance in the situation , in addition to Messrs Woll , Cahan , and Zaritsky , is not recorded by The Nation . That would be lending weight to something The Nation finds it necessary to belittle , just as you find it advantageous for your purpose to ridicule the hatters ' proposal . Strange , was it not , that a little bird , pulled out of a hat , should have occupied the attention of the Committee for Industrial Organization for two whole days , with the entire press giving it front-page publicity ? If only the editors of the country had The Nation 's conception of news values I And was it not also strange that what The Nation refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of peace , compromise , and dissensions " should have been confirmed at Pittsburgh as hard , incontrovertible facts , by no means " exclusive to the Times " ? I cite this not because I like dissension , but as an illustration that stories do not remain exclusive when based on fact . For the benefit of readers who may desire more information and less bias , it should be stated that the peace idea was not born at the aforementioned luncheon . Serious talk of peace and of the necessity of peace had been in progress for months in the important labor circles where The Nation 's editors are not known to move . Those truly familiar with the situation expected that peace moves would be launched as the A. F. of L. convention in Tampa drew near . Events confirmed the expectation . No one , of course , could be sure that the peace moves would be successful . No one ever said they would be . Weeks before the hatters made their peace proposal , the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the miners , let it be known that it was anxious that peace in the labor movement be restored . At the convention of the New York State Federation of Labor in Syracuse on August 27 , Luigi Antonini , first vice-president of the I. L. G. W. U. , made an impassioned plea for peace . Speaking as a delegate of his union Mr. Antonini appealed to the federation to help " put out the fire , " to use its good offices in behalf of peace . The Nation finds it inconvenient to record that fact . It does n't fit into its special chronology and disturbs its thesis . It spoils its " peace dove " story . Coupled with your suggestion that an old , highly respected , and progressive labor organization permitted itself to be used as an instrument for a sleight-of-hand performance , you suggest also that the Times permitted itself to be used as " a second-hand machine-shop for grinding Old Guard axes . " It is quite clear what axes you are grinding . You underestimate and distort the events of October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate aims of the hatters ' peace proposal , and you misrepresent the nature and purpose of the action taken upon it by the executivecouncil of the A. F. of L. By juggling citations of some of my stories and Washington dispatches , while omitting others , you achieve conclusions directly at variance with the facts . It is not true , for example , that the executive council of the A. F. of L. " ignored " the first part of the hatters ' proposal , the part relating to the lifting of the suspensions against the C. I. 0 . unions . Nor is it true that this was the " crucial " part . As the authors of the proposal explained it to those willing to report the situation objectively , and in statements for publication , their hope was that once both sides appointed committees , as provided in the proposal , and entered into negotiations , a formula would be found , given good-will and cooperation on both sides , which would make possible the lifting of the suspensions . The record shows that the actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council to negotiate with the C. I. 0 . were clearly in the same direction . It is likewise untrue that the executive council 's committee sought to meet with " individuals " in a move to split the C. I. 0 . The record shows that the committee aimed at a joint conference with a committee of the C. I. 0 . unions . The Nation ignores the fact that both the executive council and its committee , while undertaking no commitments , also made no stipulations  --  an important step forward in view of the council 's previous categorical demand for dissolution of the C. I. 0 . as a condition preliminary to the lifting of suspensions . The " splitting tactic " charged to the council 's committee is not born out by the facts . Nor is there evidence in the record that Mr. Zaritsky replied to any " splitting tactic . " He merely reaffirmed his desire for collective peace . The situation as presented by The Nation on these and other points is therefore not " clear-cut " but rather a distortion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof whatever that I ever stated that " the C. I. 0 . was crumbling and begging for peace . " This is pure invention on your part . According to The Nation I was persecuting Mr. Lewis for " delaying peace by not accepting terms which would mean the end of the C. I. 0 . and all it stands December 5 , 1936 for . " The stories merely reported truthfully the dissatisfaction in C. I. 0 . ranks here with Mr. Lewis 's delay in naming a negotiations committee after he had already accepted the hatters ' peace proposal , characterized by The Nation itself as giving " whole-hearted defense and support to the C. I. 0 . " Now that Louis Stark has reported from Pittsburgh that Messrs . Zaritsky and Dubinsky were " visibly disappointed " with the refusal to name a committee , I suppose it would be proper to state , in the language of The Nation , that " the ' peacemakers ' were still irked . " That Mr. Lewis had actually indorsed the hatters ' proposal was reported in a dispatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation suppresses this fact . It confines itself to saying that in a New York story in the Times of October 9 I had misrepresented Mr. Lewis 's position . Two other exhibits you offer as introducing " a note of reality " into my allegedly false picture are spurious because you fail to give all the facts . I refer to the two Washington dispatches you cite so gleefully , the first of which was headlined " Labor Peace Move Strikes New Snag , " etc. , and " Move to Split C. I. 0 . Begun by A. F. of L. , " etc . You fail to make clear that the letter to Mr. Zaritsky figuring in the first dispatch was from the executive council 's committee in response to Mr. Lewis 's demand for clarification , also reported in the same dispatch . You fail to mention that the letter was intended for transmission to all C. I. 0 . members , and that it was actually transmitted to all C. I. 0 . members . These facts do not harmonize with the charge of " splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your effort to discredit people you do n't agree with and my reporting of developments . You also conveniently ignore the offer contained in the letter to reconsider the C. I. 0 . suspensions . You prefer to tell your readers that the A. F. of L. " ignored " this matter . As part of your effort to mislead on this point you ignore also the statement of William Green , president of the A. F. of L , in the Times of October 28 ( first edition ) , in which he stated unequivocally that the A. F. of L. had abandoned its demand that " the C. I. 0 . be dissolved as a condition previous to peace discussions . " " We now make no stipulations precedent to a conference , because the executive council fully appreciates and understands that if a settlement of differences can be reached , both the dissolution of the C. I. 0 . and the reinstatement of the unions constituting it will be automatically settled , " Mr. Green said . " That would follow logically . " The letter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statement just quoted did , indeed , introduce " a note of reality " into the situation , but The Nation chooses to suppress these facts . Additional evidence of your unfair and colored reporting is offered in the suppression of an important detail in connection with the Washington story headlined " Move to Split C. I. 0 . Begun by A. F. of L. , " etc . The story was based upon the letter from the executive council 's committee to Mr. Zaritsky , the text of which was not available for publication in Washington when the story was filed . The actual text of the letter flatly contradicted the story , which next day , October 17 , provoked a denial from the committee . The Times carried the denial , in accordance with proper journalistic practice . You ignore it completely in your one-sided picture . You print the accusation and suppress the defense . You also make much of a story in the Times of October 25 , in which , according to your article , " the campaign against the C. I. 0 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been based upon information from steel cirdes . It so happens that I did not write this particular story . There never was any " campaign against the C I. 0. " on my part or on the part of the authors of the peace proposal . The story of October 27 , in which I am supposed to have continued to " bait " Mr. Lewis , stood up , as have all the other stories you seek to discredit . Your suggestion that Mr. Lewis had come to New York to meet three prominent members of the C. I. 0 . without having any intention to speak to any of them about the C. I. 0 . situation is puerile . There is documentary evidence that he did come here with such intention . As a matter of fact , on his own suggestion , I was to call Mr. Dubinsky that evening to get whatever information there was available for publication after he was to have conferred with Mr. Lewis . There remains , finally , the fuss you make about the Dubinsky speech of October 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Dubinsky had abandoned the ideological position of the C. I. 0 . Mr. Lewis 's views on Mr. Dubinsky 's speech are irrelevant . Nor is the disagreement between Mr. Lewis and Mr. Green as to what Mr. Dubinsky said of any importance . I conveyed to Mr. Green a brief summary of the speech as it affected the possibilities for peace , and other relevant facts of the situation as it was shaping itself at that time . That was natural . He would have been a poor reporter who would have failed to get the Green angle of the story . What does matter is whether Mr. Dubinsky complained about my story . He did not . Had his position been misrepresented he would have been entitled to a correction and he would have got it . He expressed satisfaction with the story when I spoke to him on the morning of October 5 . Because he speaks with unusual rapidity , making it difficult for a stenographer to follow him , he undertook  --  so he informed me  --  to correct the stenographic record and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no special practical significance in Mr. Dubinsky 's speech is contradicted by the reception he received from the audience , the interpretation of other newspapermen present , and the consequences that followed . To cast doubt upon the validity of my report you forget to mention that three days later Mr. Dubinsky actually conferred with Mr. Green in an effort to facilitate peace . But I have already mentioned so many facts you found it convenient to forget that it is not necessary to add more The record shows clearly , to paraphrase your conclusion , that readers of The Nation must not take your reporting seriously . It is not reliable . JOSEPH SHAPLEN New York , November 10 Mr. Shaplen fails to controvert the contentions of our editorial of November 7 . David Dubinsky at the hatters ' convention stated that his organization would like to have peace providing the basis of that peace was the organization along industrial lines of the mass-production industries . The Times report , which was headed " Peace Overtures Made to A. F. of L. by C. I. 0 . Leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the C. I. 0 . would dissolve if the A. F. of L. would help organize the steel industry but omitted the underlined stipulation , thereby completely distorting the position of Mr. Dubinsky . Taken in conjunction with the headline , it clearly carried the implication that " C. I. 0 . leaders " were ready to recede from a position the C. I. 0 . has consistently held and continues to hold until the moment of going to press . Thefact that Mr. Dubinsky did not complain is irrelevant . Neither did he complain about Mr. Lewis 's correction which was contained in a dispatch from Washington the next day . On this score one of Mr. Shaplen 's own defenders proves our case . In a letter to The Nation , which we shall not publish because it has already appeared in the Socialist New Leader , Richard Rohman- , a labor reporter , who was present when Mr. Dubinsky spoke , testifies , in defense of Mr. Shaplen , that he Mr. Rohman reported Mr. Dubinsky 's speech " in virtually the identical words employed by Mr. Shaplen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did say that he was prepared to give up the C. I. 0 . provided the A. F. of L. agreed to undertake a campaign to organize workers in the mass-production industries on an industrial-union basis " ? which is exactly The Nation 's contention . The fact that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Green disagreed as to what Mr. Dubin-sky said was obviously of the utmost importance since the industrial organization of the mass-production industries is the central issue in the controversy between the A. F. of L. and the C. I. 0 . We did not criticize Mr. Shaplen for getting the " Green angle " of the story . We criticized him because , from all indications , he gave Mr. Green the impression that Mr. Dubinsky had deserted the position of the C. I. 0 . The " peace overture " of the hatters ' convention , which was , to speak more accurately , a plea to the executive council that it reverse its position , was carefully quoted in our editorial . After a long introduction Eiving whole-hearted support to the C. I. 0 . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon the executive council to permit the organizations affiliated with the C. I. 0 . to be represented in the next convention ; ( 2 ) proposed that " pending the rendering of judgment by the convention " the council name a subcommittee to meet with a like subcommittee of the C. I. 0 . " for the purpose of jointly exploring the possibilities of reconciling the existing differences and finding a formula by which the hopes of all workers for the unity of the labor movement and the organization of the workers in the mass-production industries may be realized . " Since the C. I. 0 . could not be represented in the convention unless the suspensions were lifted , these two recommendations , if they mean anything , mean that the hatters were recommending that the suspensions be lifted and that the question whether or not to The NATION suspend be decided at a convention at which delegates from the C. I. 0 . unions as well as those from the other unions would be present and voting . For the C. I. 0 . to have appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to acknowledge the legality of that action , which the C. I. 0 . has so far refused to do . When , therefore , the suspensions were not lifted , the C. I. 0 . did not appoint a committee . We rest upon the text of the resolution , not on what its authors are reported by Mr. Shaplen to have thought they meant by it . The fact that Mr. Zaritsky hotly defended the C. I. 0 . in Tampa and that the C. I. 0 . interpreted the proposal as we have indicated must also be noted . We did not state that the " peace idea was born " at the luncheon for Mr. Cahan . It was at that time that peace began its career in the Times . We based our editorial comment on the text of the hatters ' resolution . We maintain that " the part relating to the lifting of the suspensions " was crucial . The executive council ignored this section in that it did not lift the suspensions . If Mr. Shaplen prefers the phrase " refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same . We did not say that Mr. Shaplen " ever stated ' that the C. I. 0 . was crumbling and begging for peace . ' " Whereas Mr. Shaplen accused us in an earlier paragraph of distorting the character and immediate aims of the hatters ' resolution , he later quotes with evident approval our description of the hatters ' resolution as giving " whole-hearted defense and support to the C. I. 0 . " Of course Mr. Lewis indorsed it since it restated his own position , but he accepted the two sections together and in order ( 1 ) the lifting of suspensions , and ( 2 ) the appointment of a subcommittee . The executive council accepted only the second part . Large headlines reported Mr. Lewis as " joining " the peace move when he said that if the executive council would lift the suspensions the C. I. 0 . would be willing to negotiate . Is that " joining " ? The fact that the letter was sent to all C. I. 0 . members supports our opinion that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally the executive council denied that it was a splitting tactic . The executive council also denies that industrial unionism has anything to do with the present controversy . We missed the first edition of the Times . We are glad to see that Mr. Green was willing to relent on the sus- pensions . The Tampa convention was not . We in no way suggested that " the authors of the peace proposal , " if Mr. Shaplen means Dubinsky and Zaritsky , were making a campaign against the C. I. 0 . We suggested that reactionary A. F. of L. leaders were trying to split the needle trades away from the C. I. 0 . through bearing down on the value of an A. F. of L. affiliation . That campaign has now become overt ? EDITORS THE NATION . ) Norman Thomas and the C. I. O. Dear Sirs : Heywood Broun defends his unwarranted statement that Norman Thomas has not dared to indorse the C. I. 0 . by writing in your columns on November 21 that " if Mr. Thomas is lending support , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee . " If the C. I. 0 . leader does not know of Thomas 's support , he does n't read his own official organ , the United Mine Workers ' Journal , which on September 1 , 1936 , reported the following : " Backs the C. I. 0 . Norman Thomas Takes Stand for Industrial Unions . " The story begins : " Norman Thomas , Socialist candidate for President , has placed himself behind John L. Lewis and the industrial-union forces ordered suspended by A. F. of L. " Mr. Broun has the inalienable right to be ignorant of the most publicized of facts , but he has no reason to claim that John L. Lewis shares his ignorance .
