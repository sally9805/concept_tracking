PHILOSOPHER 'S HOLIDAY-Irwin Edman-Viking ( $2.75 ) <P> Irwin Edman was 21 when he began teaching philosophy at Columbia University . On the campus one day shortly afterwards he met his old professor , Felix Adler . " What are you doing now ? " inquired the professor . " Teaching , " said Edman . " Teaching what ? " " Philosophy , " said Edman . The old man patted the open-faced , blond youth on the back . " How cute ! " he said . <P> At 38 , Edman was made a full Professor of Philosophy . Now 41 , and one of Columbia 's most popular professors , he is also credited , through his writings , with an increased attendance in philosophy courses at other colleges as well . As a teacher of philosophy he no longer runs the risk of being called cute . As a philosopher in his own right , he might still tempt some old philosopher to do so . <P> Edman 's own philosophy is a humanist cocktail whose chief ingredients are Plato , Santayana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pickled cherry , out of Philosopher 's Holiday , a tall , watery glassful of reminiscences , anecdotes and essays devoted to " persons and places , many of them obscure , about which I have occasionally told my friends over a glass of sherry . . . . " Son of a shirt &; blouse manufacturer , Philosopher Edman still lives in the neighborhood where he was born and brought up , a stone 's throw from Columbia University . He has " spent a long life " in Carnegie Hall and art galleries , writes light topical verse , travels much in Europe , wears thick glasses , has a bad stomach , and in general exhibits the intellectual precocity , the urbane humor , the tastes and the slightly nervous detachment which seem as native to Manhattan as The New Yorker . <P> Professor Edman recalls with nostalgia his pleasant childhood and youth on Morningside Heights , the teachers who stimulated him , a few of his more picturesque students ( some now stuffed shirts , some leading Communists ) ; he writes of his travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an encounter with a big-shot Nazi in Greece . But the spotlight is on those amateur philosophers whom he numbers among the " Society of Itinerant Humanists . " One was a French doctor who came to treat Edman 's indigestion , launched instead into a discourse on Platonic philosophy . Another is his maid Maria , one of the best philosophers who ever kept a bachelor 's apartment in order , and Edman 's tribute is probably one of the sweetest portraits of a maid in literature . <P> Along with these portraits Philosopher Edman does not neglect philosophical morals , which consist mainly of advice not to become panicky about the way the contemporary world is going . Spinoza , he points out , went on grinding lenses for a living while war and revolution raged around him in Holland , and Santayana , Edman 's Master , meditates serenely on Essences under the very shadow of Mussolini 's jaw . Readers will envy Philosopher Edman his ability to enjoy himself . They will not be able to figure out , from this book , quite how to imitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend of academic and worldly man , does not derive as much from his temperament as from the study of philosophy .
