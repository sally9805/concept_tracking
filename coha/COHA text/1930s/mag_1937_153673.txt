Ready for a major battle at the drop of a coolie hat last week were Japanese divisions in North China , totaling about 45,000 men , faced by an estimated 150,000 Chinese troops . Nobody dropped it . Instead there occurred an almost unprecedented act in the history of China 's foreign concessions . Day after serious little Japanese marines had clambered ashore at Hankow , 600 mi. up the Yangtze River and 600 mi. south of the Peiping-Tientsin front , to protect some 3,500 Japanese nationals , the entire Japanese population of Hankow was suddenly ordered to evacuate the city , almost the first time that any foreign concession in China has been completely abandoned . <P> Reason for this move was that the commander of the Japanese torpedo flotilla responsible for the marine landing at Hankow ( part of a staff officer 's dream of cutting China in two through naval control of the Yangtze ) suddenly found the city surrounded on three sides by an overwhelming Chinese army , saw a squadron of Chinese bombers flying over his head . There was just one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation were three shallow-draft U.S. gunboats built in China for use on China 's rivers , the Oahu , Guam and Luson , the latter flying the two-starred flag of Rear Admiral Edward J. Marquart . <P> In North China , meanwhile , Japanese troops dug in on their 150-mi. , fan-shaped front , took formal possession of Peiping with a column of 3,000 men , prepared to move against the most immediate Chinese threat , Chinese Government troops , strength unknown , who might possible drive down from Kalgan northwest of Peiping to cut Japanese lines of communication between Peiping and Tientsin . <P> Almost daily Chinese warlords continued to arrive at Nanking to pledge their full assistance to Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , the latest to arrive being General Liu Hsiang , the chairman-dictator of Szechuan Province . Veteran correspondents were quick to point out how different this was from the manchurian crisis of 1931 when Chiang Kai-shek defied Japan as loudly , called for unified action as ardently , and practically all the Chinese warlords stayed prudently at home . <P> First paper to come out last week with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Tokyo Nichi Nichi . According to this scheme , Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek will not wait for the small Japanese army to advance its lines of communication farther south , but will attack almost at once before the fighting enthusiasm of the Chinese , whipped to a fine frenzy by years of Japanese insult , can cool . <P> Chiang naturally will remain commander-in-chief , will have as his chief-of-staff General Pai Tsung-hsi , one of China 's most brilliant military strategists . Generals Yen Hsi-shan and Han Fu-chu warlords of Shansi-Suiyan and Shantung provinces respectively , will command the left and right wings ; command of the important centre will be divided between Generals Liu Chih and Feng Chi-han.
