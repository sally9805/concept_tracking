U. S. funerals continue extravagant , the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care reminded the country last week . Original investigation occurred three years ago . Reasons for extravagance : 1 ) the family wants to show respect , satisfy conventions , or " impress the neighbors " ; 2 ) the funeral industry is wasteful and unorganized . Funerals cost least in the South , most in the East . Cheapest are Orthodox Jewish funerals ( a pit , a plain , loose casing ) , average cost $247.
