txt Mayor O'Brien disclosed last night that he was considering the possibility of using $22,000,000 in rapid transit sinking funds for relief purposes this year or next . During the day the Board of Estimate again delayed action on the $30,000,000 tax program to raise relief funds . Controller Charles W. Berry explained that the sinking fund surplus had accumulated when the Board of Estimate last year changed the method of subway financing from four-year bonds to fifty-year bonds . At the same time he expressed his disinclination to apply the surplus to relief without a court order . He pointed out that the funds had been raised from general taxation specifically for rapid transit use . Disagreeing with this view , Mayor O'Brien indicated the possibility of applying the surplus to relief financing this year . Should that not prove feasible , he said , the $22,000 , - 000 could be placed la the budget for relief next year . He would not discuss its use this year because he said he did not wish to be drawn into a discussion of the various ways in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berry . When the Controller 's viewpoint was set before him , the Mayor said : " That 's the view in the Controller 's office . I do not agree with it . I think the surplus could be used for relief this year , or placed in the budget for relief next year . I understand the Controller 's argument , but the Board of Estimate changed its transit policy when it decided to finance subways through fifty-year bands instead of fouryear bonds . That made a free reserve in the rapid transit sinking funds that can be transferred for other purposes . I think it can be transferred . The taxpayers should get the benefit , and if that sum is placed in the 1934 budget the benefit will be reflected everywhere . " Asked whether that action would not solve the problem of raising $30,000,000 in new revenue this year , the Mayor replied that he was more inclined to use the money in next year 's budget . There is a possibility that the city may borrow relief funds from the bankers this year , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $22,000.000 could be placed in the next budget to retire the certificates of indebtedness issued against this year 's relief financing . The Citizens Budget Commission for several months has advocated the use of the rapid transit surplus . Sinking funds in general are strongly protected by law . On previous occasions the State Legislature has had to , sanction other uses for the funds . While the city 's tax plans hung suspended , Controller Berry said he favored an indirect tax as preferable to a direct tax . He did not advocate a general sales tax directly , merely declaring it was easier to raise money through indirect taxation than by asking a taxpayer to " go into his pocket for a $10 bill .

The proposal for a city tax of I cent oh every bond or share sale was renewed by Maurice Hotchner , former chairman of the Board of Taxicab Control , in a letter to Mayor O'Brien . Such a tax , Mr. Hotchner declared , would yield more than $21,000,000 annually . The burden of the tax , he declared , would fall upon those who could most afford it . Mr. Hotchner 's letter contained figures covering market transactions during the past ' five years . These , he contended , supported his estimate of the annual revenue to be derived from the tax .
