On September 30 , Herbert Roslyn ( " Bud " ) Ekins of the Scripps-Howard New York World-Telegram , Dorothy Kilgallen of Hearst 's New York Journal and Leo Kieran of the New York Times set off on the Hindenburg to race around the world on commercial airlines as a publicity stunt for their respective papers . Bad planning on the part of the Journal and Times , plus a couple of offside jumps by Reporter Ekins , soon put that World- Telegram man far in the lead . This week he completed the world trip in 18 days , 14 hr. , 56 min. , 50 and 2/5 sec. , by no means a record .
