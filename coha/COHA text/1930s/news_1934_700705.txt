txt The strike at the Seabrook Farms , which began more than two weeks ago and flared into violence yesterday , was settled late this afternoon . The strikers accepted a settlement arranged by John A. Moffit , United States Commissioner of Conciliation , sent here by Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins . The workers will return to their jobs tomorrow on the basis of their former wage scale , an agreement by the employer against discrimination in rehiring strikers , and the appointment of an impartial adjust- ' , rhent board to settle disputes . Donald Henderson , former eco-1 nomics instructor at Columbia University , who has been active in the strike leadership as an organizer for the Agricultural Canners Industrial Union , tried to persuade the strikers to reject the settlement . Apparently anxious to go back to work , the strikers mobbed Henderson and handled him roughly before deputy sheriffs and policemen rescued him . All those arrested during the strike were released tonight except one man who was found to have been out on parole . Conference Lasts All Day . The agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the farm property , only a short distance from the cannery and the workers ' dwellings , outside of which yesterday 's rioting occurred . These buildings are set back several hundred yards from Route 46 , the concrete State highway that connects Bridgeton with Camden and Philadelphia . Many of the employes live in company-owned houses , for which they , pay $3 to $8 a month in rent out of their wages at the rate of 30 cents an hour for men and 25 cents an hour for women . When the strike began the strike leaders charged that they had been notified their wages were to be cut to 18 cents an hour . This was denied by Charles F. Seabrook , president of the Investment Management Corporation , Inc. , the corporate name of the property . Mr. Seabrook contended the strike was entirely the work of outside Communist agitators , who took advantage of the necessity of laying off workers at the end of the bean-harvesting season . Mr. Seabrook attended today 's conference with his attorneys , inchiding Assemblyman Douglas V. Aitken , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two laws by the State Legislature , calling on Governor A. Harry Moore to send State police here to keep order and authorizing the appointment of a legislative committee to investigate alleged communistic activities of the strike organizers . The , strikers were represented by David L. Horuvitz of . this city , counsel for the union . Mr. Moffitt was present as mediator , accompanied in the early part of the conference by Thomas W. Holland , acting head of the Regional Labor Board of Newark . Strikers ' Group Heard . Mr. Holland left about noon , saying he was present merely to see that the NRA code was being observed by the cannery . About the same time a strikers ' committee of seven , who had been meeting elsewhere with Mr. Henderson , went to the administration building and joined the conference for about fifteen minutes , after which they left . At 2 P. M. Mr. Horuvitz left the conference room and announced that a settlement had been agreed upon and would be submitted to the strikers at a mass meeting at 4 o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was announced : " That the employer will employ as many of his employee that are now on strike that he has work for without discrimination . " That a roster of those whom he has no ready employment for will be made and , before employing new help , preference shall be given to those whose names appear on the roster , return to be made under the conditions that prevailed prior to their going on strike . " There shall be an impartial board of adjustment appointed consisting of five members ; two representing the farmers , the same to be selected by the master of the Pomona Grange of Cumberland County ; two public-spirited citizens , one to be the county farm agent , one to be designated by the Cumberland County Common Pleas judge , and the fifth to be John A. Moffitt , United St ' es Commissioner of Conciliations . The board shall select its chairman . " The duties of the board shall consist in , deciding any question in controversy between employer and employe and the decision of the board thereon shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The board shall regulate its own procedure . " The announcement also disclosed that the settlement had been approved by a representative of the Grange League Federation , a firstAien creditor of the company . Workers Await Outcome . Strikers milled around the administration building all afternoon , waiting for the mass meeting . They were men , women and young girls , wearing blue denim overalls , blue and white dresses and straw hats . A large proportion were Negroes and most of the others apparently were first or second generati ) n foreign groups . At 4 o'clock between 300 and 400 were on hand and Mr. Horuvitz was ready to make his announcement , but Mr. Henderson and the . strike committee of seven were absent . The crowd waited for the committee members , who appeared about 5 o'clock , bearing a soap box and a tattered American flag . Mr .. Horuvitz mounted the soap ? bed in front of the administration bi4ding:and ? reid the five article-B-. of the agreement , which he explained , in detail over , and over again . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work tomorrow morning . " I have done all I can for you , " he said , " and if you do not accept this agreement I can do no more . All I have received for this work-is a fee of $40 , and I have done eleven days and nights work . ? I would not do it over again for $4,000 . ' " Now if you want bloodshed , gas bombs- and your homes ruined , as Took place yesterday , you can turn down this agreement , but I advise you to accept it , for it is clearly in your best interests . " The crowd had seemed sullen and embittered before the meeting began , but it showed obvious pleasure as the settlement was read . The workers ' faces brightened and they cheered and applauded Mr. Horuvitz . Henderson Fights Settlement . Henderson then climbed on the ) ap box . In contrast with the strikers ' lawyer , who was the only man at the meeting who wore a coat , the agitator was coatless and wore a blue shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue and red tie . Attacking Mr. Horuvitz , Hendersoncharged that he and the Seabrook representatives had framed the settlement without consulting the strike committee , which , he said , had decided to reject it as " dictatorial and high-handed . " He complained that it said nothing about the twenty-seven persons arrested and held in the county jail in default of bail . One of these is Henderson 's wife . The strike committee had decided , Henderson announced , that the board should consist of seven members , three to be appointed by the union , three by the employer and the seventh to be Mr. Moffett or some one appointed by him . It also demanded , he said , that all the prisoners be released immediately . Mr. Horuvitz announced that an informal agreement provided for the release of the prisoners tonight if the strikers accepted the settlement . He then urged more emphatically than before that the workers accept the plan and return to work . As Mr. Horuvitz left the soapboax amid loud applause , Henderson leaped back on it . He urged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ffitt ith a demand that the board be increased to nine men , four to be workers . The crowd , which had swayed back and forth between the two speakers , received this proposal with apparent enthusiasm , and for a moment it looked as if the strike settlement would be deferred at least another day . Workers Roar Assent . Mr. Horuvitz jumped back on the soapbox , however , and shouted : " Now , boys , tell me , man to man , do you really want to go back to work ? " " Yes , " came the booming response , as with one voice . Without being asked , almost every one in the crowd raised his hand , and the workers , as if moved by a common impulse , set off on a half run to -- ward the administration building , where it was known they could sign up to go back to work . As they reached the doorway of the building a policeman , on duty , . there asked : " Is the strike over ? " 1 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " shouted Henderson , who had gone along , withAwo members of the strike committee ' . This led to the rough treatment of Henderson by some of the strikers . The crowd closed In around him , and there were cries- 4,1 ' . " Throw him out of here , he 's caused enough trouble , " and " Let me ? at him . " Henderson was being jostled-severely when a ? half dozen policemen leaped down from the steps of the building and rescued him . Mr. Moffitt ; then addressed the strikers from ' the steps , asserting that the adjustment board would be impartial , would hear all workers ' grievances and would give fair decisions . " If I thought for one minute that it was created for the purpose of making decisions in favor of Mr. Seabrook and against you , I would not approve it , " he said . " After you return to work tomorrow I hope there will be lasting peace . "                @ @ @ @ @
