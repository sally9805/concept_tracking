Amid the cloistered books &; beams of the Provost 's Lodge at Eton College , most famed of Britain 's swank public schools and academic nursery of England 's royalty and peerage , sat last week the newly appointed Provost of Eton , the Rt . Hon. Lord Hugh Richard Heathcote Cecil , fifth son of the third Marquess of Salisbury , alumnus of Eton and Oxford , Member of Parliament for Oxford University for 26 years . Ever since Henry VI , who founded Eton in 1440 , appointed one of his chief advisers to preside over the College 's governing body as Provost , this office has been the most coveted and glorious in <P> Britain 's academic world . The Provost , who holds the office for life , is appointed by the Crown , must be a Master of Arts in the University of Oxford or of Cambridge , must reside in Eton College during the whole of every school term . Reputed to receive a stipend of some $25,000 per year , he must hold no other money-making job . <P> In tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of the genial and patriarchal Dean of Windsor representing King Edward VIII , Eton 's Fellows , scholarly Eton Headmaster Claude Aurelius ( ' The Emperor " ) Elliott , and 1,100 top-hatted Etonians . Up to the outer doors of School Yard walked Lord Hugh with stately , processional steps . His three knocks on the great oak door significantly implied that the Fellows of Eton need not admit the King 's nominee unless they wanted to . The Fellows , though , had decided that they wanted Lord Hugh , admitted him . Crossing School Yard to Upper Chapel he produced his royal warrant to prove he was no impostor , listened to addresses in Latin by Headmaster Elliott and the captain of the school . Lord Hugh , as was fitting , replied in Latin , but probably not 50 of the 1,100 aristocratic youths present knew what he was talking about . For many of them their knowledge of Latin begins and ends with the school motto Floreat Etona ( " May Eton Flourish " ) .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
