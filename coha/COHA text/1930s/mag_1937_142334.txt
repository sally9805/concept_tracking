Before March 15 income tax installments were due , the Bureau of Internal Revenue blithely estimated that 6,000,000 glum people would make returns. - This calculation began to go awry about ten days ago when tax offices far &; wide began clamoring for more tax blanks . Hastily blanks were shunted to the places with the greatest shortages . The Bureau hastily boosted its estimates of returns to 6,500,000 . <P> Also before March 15 , the Treasury expected $840,000,000 in payments . This also was a misprision . By the end of last week when the Treasury had counted up income tax receipts for the first 20 days of March ( during which the bulk of the first quarter 's income tax payments are made ) the total was $650,000,000-67% more than in the same period a year before , but short of expectations . It is now a question of whether the President 's prediction of Federal Revenue for the fiscal year may not prove several hundred million dollars too big . <P> For several days observers had been wondering audibly whether the " crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court ( TIME , Feb. 15 et seq. ) , was the onset of violent inflation . Marriner Eccles , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , had issued a warning that rising prices must be checked by higher taxes and budget balancing . Although the forces of inflation had been unostentatiously at work for four years , not since 1933 had the U. S. public enjoyed such a good inflation scare . New Deal Congressmen who were already worried over the problem of passing the President 's Supreme Court bill , shuddered at the suggestion that they should add to their troubles by having to up taxes . <P> " God knows , " ejaculated Senator Pat Harrison , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , " taxes are high enough now . " <P> *Only about half of those who are obliged to make returns have to pay tax , however . Prior to Depression the number making returns was about 4,000,000 ; during Depression it fell to around 3,225,000.                    @
