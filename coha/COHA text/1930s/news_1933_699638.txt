Aroused by the reports , the prosecutor took immediate action , announcing that the entire power of his office would be used to keep legal beer business free from any hoodlum taint .

" I intend to- assure the men now licensed to manufacture and sell beer at wholesale in this county that the hoodlums are not to be tolerated in this new industry .

" The reports of gang activity in the 4.2 beer trade reached the prosecutor from representatives of district business organizations , neighbbrhood groups , hotels , and restaurant associations . The plan of the hoodlum beer syndicates , it was said , is to force themselves on breweries . In the bootleg beer era it has been known that the beer gangs divided the city into districts with their lines as closely drawn as police districts . One such syndicate which may or may not have been a part of a larger syndicate in control of beer sales in the three divisions of the city  --  north side , west side , and south side  --  would control all beer sales In as many as 200 or 300 beer dispensaries in a police district , according to persons familiar with the gang setup .

" Buy our beer or get pineapples , " they were told . Visit Brewer Next . After they have lined up customers by means of these threats , Mr. Courtney has been informed , these gangsters plan to go to a brewer with this proposition : " We control 200 or 300 dealers . To sell any of them you must do so through our outfit . We 'll charge only a fair commission . " The brewers have said they have no desire to deal with the gangsters . They point out they would soon be at the mercy of organized outlaws because the gangsters could demand larger and larger commissions under threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his determination to eliminate the hoodlum element from the , beer industry Mr. Courtney said : " I am advocating a law requiring the publication each six months of the names of all owners of brewery stock .

Through the power to license we have the power to control the , personnel of those engaging in the beer business . " U. S. Scanning Applications . E. C.
