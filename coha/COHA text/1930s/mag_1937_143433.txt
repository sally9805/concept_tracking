Before he left Washington to go fishing off Florida last fortnight , Franklin Roosevelt completed two messages to Congress . In the first , he asked for amendments to the 1934 Housing Act , to stimulate the U. S. building industry by making it easier for prospective homebuilders to finance their houses ( TIME , Dec. 6 ) . In the second , he asked Congress for a $112,000,000 reduction in Federal appropriations for road building , as a step toward a balanced budget in 1939 . While the President and his party cruised about the Gulf Stream last week , daily messages from a temporary White House in the Miami-Biltmore Hotel at Coral Gables , Fla. kept him informed about the repercussions of his messages in Washington . <P> Reception to the housing message was generally favorable . By week 's end , committees in both Houses were busy holding hearings on bills embodying the Administration 's plans . Reception to the slash in roads appropriations was exactly the reverse . Congress felt somewhat aggrieved in the first place at being left to wrestle with the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A request to cut in half an appropriation for such a valuable vote-getting purpose as highway construction looked like advance preparation for blaming Congress , if it failed to approve the cut , in case the 1938-39 budget is not balanced . Nonetheless , by week 's end , it was rumored that the Bureau of the Budget was preparing still more drastic means of satisfying the President 's desire for a balanced budget . Biggest slash being considered-in anticipation of the President 's budget message to the regular session-was $500,000,000 from the $1,500,000,000 relief appropriation for the current fiscal year . Others were $100,000,000 from the PWA 's appropriation of $600,000,000 , $75,000,000 from the Civilian Conservation Corps 's $275,000,000 . With the addition of other minor cuts along the line , as well as the $112,000,000 asked by the President from its road-building largesse to the States , the total curtailment would be about $800,000,000-roughly what the Treasury estimates must be pared from last year 's total appropriations of $7,164,817,513 if next year 's are not to exceed the Federal income . <P> While Congress thought about money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program the President proposed for it last month . Consequently when , at week 's end , word arrived at the Miami base where Secretary Marvin Mclntyre was in charge , that the President had decided to come ashore a day earlier than originally planned , go direct to Washington instead of stopping off at Gainesville and Warm Springs , Ga. , political reporters promptly began to draw conclusions . Reason given by the President was that his infected jaw-from which Commander Arthur H. Yando , White House dentist , extracted a diseased molar last fortnight- was not healing rapidly as it should have . Reason suggested by political reporters- who discarded a new crop of wild rumors that the President was seriously ill-was that the President felt obliged to crack the whip over Congress .
