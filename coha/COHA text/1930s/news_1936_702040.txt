txt VIEWS ON COL . KNOX 'S SPEECH Varied Comment From Readers of The New York Times . No matter how sensible a man may be in his business transactions , when he assumes the role of a partisan in politics he seems to lose all sense of proportion , ignores everything which does not favor his candidate for office , paints the opposing candidate as a fool or a rogue or both , and indulges in the wildest predictions as to the beneficent results which will follow the election of his party 's ticket . He sees no inconsistencies , -contradictions- or weaknesses in his party ' platform declarations , and he refuses to allow for any merit , honesty of purpose or practical sense in the platform of the opposing party . No doubt Frank Knox will be a competent official if elected to the office for which he is a contender , but his speech of acceptance does not indicate anything of the kind . JOHN F. SCHINDLER . New York , July 31 , 1936.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
