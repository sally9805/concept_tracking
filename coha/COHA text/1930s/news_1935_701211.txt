txt The March grand jury , which has been investigating the policy racket , temporarily suspended questioning of witnesses yesterday to have one of them held in contempt of court for refusing to answer questions held essential to a phase of the inquiry . The witness , Martin Mooney , a reporter for The New York American , was sentenced to thirty days in jail and was fined $250 . He informed Judge Morris Koenig before the penalty was imposed that he had declined to answer the questions on the ground that they invaded his constitutional rights , for they sought to obtain from him information he had obtained in a confidential capacity as a newspaper man from persons allied with policy racketeers . The questions related to published reports on an alleged alliance of a politician with others in a conspiracy to violate the gambling statute through policy rings . Plea Presented by Wahl .

Dodge had been excluded from the grand jury room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wahl contended that the answers were essential and that Mr. Mooney could not be excused from answering . Lee Thompson Smith , foreman of the grand jury , who stood beside Mr. Wahl and Assistant District Attorneys Harold W. Hastings and Lyon Boston during the argument and occasionally interjected a statement supporting Mr. Wahl , was the subject of some of the remarks made by the witness . Judge Koenig offered Mr. Mooney , through his lawyer , James D. C. Murray , an opportunity to return to the grand jury room to answer the questions , but when the lawyer said that it would be " futile " because his client would not change his mind , the court placed the witness in the custody of the lawyer until tomorrow , when he is to appear before the court again . This means that unless Mr. Mooney recedes from his position the court will put the sentence into execution . Mr. Murray said , however , that he would go before the Supreme Court on a motion for a writ to stay Judge Koenig 's judgment and that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to justify his client 's stand . Mr. Mooney had been called before the grand jurors about two weeks ago for questioning on the articles he had written for his newspaper on the alleged alliance of politicians and policy gambling leaders . He balked , however , at some of the questions , it was ; brought out yesterday , and was warned by Mr. Wahl , who was presenting most of the evidence to the grand jurors , that under the Dowling gambling act he must answer . Full Responsibility Taken . The questions that were the subject of the contempt proceeding were read to Judge Koenig in open court . They revealed that at the beginning of his testimony Mr. Mooney had taken full responsibility for the publication of the statements on which the grand jurors sought information . One of the questions that led up to Judge Koenig 's decision that the witness would have to return to answer all of them was : " You testified heretofore that you were present when certain policy gamblers telephoned to a person known as Jimmie Hines . When was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The early part of March , 1935 , " was the answer . " Were you present at the time the call was made ? " was the next question . " I was present , " the witness answered . " Several men discussed calling Jimmie to get somebody out of a jam . " The question , ' Who were the men who discussed having Jimmie get him out of a jam ? " the witness refused to answer , but he said in response to another question that the " discussion " had been in " Upper Manhattan . " Tells of Two Calls . The witness then was asked , according to the transcript of the grand jury , interrogation : " Do you know whether any telephone Call was made to Mr. Hines ? " To this he replied : " I know one call was made to 1,450 Broadway , with the idea of getting the pone number where Mr. Hines could be reached . Subsequently another phone call was made , but I do n't know who made it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone ? " was another question , to which the witness answered : " I do n't know . " He continued that he had not overheard the conversation on the telephone , but when the interrogator persisted with : " You did hear some discussion about a . person named Jimmie ? " Mr. Mooney was represented as having said : " I know a person called Jimmie , and it later was amplified by the use of his last name . " " Do you know whether any one telephoned Mr. Hines ? " the witness was asked . " I know two phone calls were made for the purpose of getting Mr. Hines , " the witness declared . " Whether they got him , I do n't know , or what the conversation was I do n't know . " " Did you ever see Mr. Hines in the presence of these so-called gamblers ? " he was asked . " I did not , " Mr. Mooney replied . No Definite Identification . Definite identification of the " Jimmie Hines " referred to In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding before Judge Koenig . However , when the grand jury foreman recently read a statement to Judge Koenig on an impasse his colleagues had encountered in their effort to run down repeated reports that " a politician or politicians " in Harlem were friends of Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer and others in control of the policy gambling in Harlem , it was reported that the name of James J. Hines , a Tammany leader in the West Harlem district , had been brought into the grand jury investigation . One of the questions put to Mr. Mooney before the grand jurors , it was revealed in the reading of the questions yesterday , related to Dutch Schultz . This was whether the witness knew if Dutch Schultz was still interested in the policy racket , to which the witness said he " was not at present . " Mr. Murray informed the court at about this time that his client would maintain that any information he had obtained as a newspaper man would be held in confidence . " That Is his position , " he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that al-1 though doctors and their patients and lawyers and their clients could claim privileges of confidential relations , there was nothing in the statutes to give a newspaper reporter the same privileges . Witness Addresses Court . As Judge Koenig was about to penalize Mr. Mooney for his refusal to answer the grand jury questions the defendant obtained permission to address the court . " Your Honor , " he said , " if I may borrow a phrase from the District Attorney and the foreman of the grand jury , now ' I 'll be harsh . ' " Without further explanation of this , he continued : " I bad the alternative when I was pushed into the sanctum sanctorum of saying that I met Ike and Mike at an uptown bar , and that I could not remember Ike and Mike , and the address of the said bar . " I believe that a newpaper man j8 only valuable in his own profession when he holds as secret confidential information given to him on any story , particularly a story - of this kind . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that visit was to give - the twenty-one members assembled a general picture of conditions as they existed in New York . When I got into the grand jury , I found animosity existed between the District Attorney and the grand jurors . " Assistant District Attorney Wahl objected that there was no proof of such animosity , that the statement of Mr. Mooney was irrelevant and that such a condition did not exist . " I can qualify that proof , " Mr. Mooney interposed , as Judge Koenig announced : " I wo n't sit here and listen to such statements . " " I was told that the grand jury would have to adjourn immediately unless they could get some real evidence , " the witness went on , " and that if I headed a committee of my colleagues to supply that information , this matter would n't be pushed . That statement was made by none other than the foreman of the grand jurors , Mr. Smith . " I 'm simply being made the ' patsy ' for a District Attorney who warrants the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scuttled ship . When the day comes for me to earn my bread and butter by double-crossing people who are sources of information , I 'll tear up my press card . " " There is no reason for all these details being discussed , " Judge Koenig interrupted . " The witness is directed to go back to the grand ljury and answer the questions . " Mr. Mooney 's lawyer again informed the court ' that his client would stand on his decision not to answer the questions desired . As on the preceding day , the grand jurors had the anteroom and corridor outside its chamber cleared of all - but the warden and other attendants . Mr. Wahl had questioned Magistrate George DeLuca and Joseph Silver , a penitentiary inmate , before the grand jurors in the additional investigation they have been conducting into bail-bond abuses , but it was understood that they continued the exclusion of any of Mr. Dodge's. prosecuting aides in the policy racket inquiry .                   @ @
