A fine thing it is to have a patient wife , four bright-eyed children and $26,000 worth of stock in the bank . But rare is the man who has attained that state on a salary of only $43 a week . One such is kindly-faced , near-sighted Gus Anderson , who charges batteries for the electric trucks of Pilgrim Laundry , Inc. of Brooklyn , N. Y. Gus began his work 25 years ago for $25 a week and today , in his overalls and heavy shoes , he looks as though he did n't have a spare dime . But he is typical of Pilgrim 's 550 employes , 535 of whom own 75% of the stock of their $1,344,700 company . <P> Last week , when Pilgrim held its 45th annual stockholders meeting , Gus Anderson and all the other employes crowded into its cheery cafeteria ( green walls , cretonne curtains ) to hear how their management was running their business . Gus and his fellows learned that the company had run up a $10,000 deficit on a 1938 gross of $82,600 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular dividends , maintained a 7% wage increase granted in 1937 ( average wage : $25.53 a week ) . <P> Mainly responsible for this unique corporation is Pilgrim 's 65-year-old President James Edwin Dann . In the 1890s , when he was a young laundry foreman , James Dann had an idea that decent labor standards would promote efficiency , even in the laundry business . When he met Edward Huff Bancker , an idealistic college graduate with some money , his idea became the Pilgrim Laundry , opened in 1894 . <P> Specializing in quality work , Pilgrim prospered . By 1913 Partners Dann and Bancker could afford a new $1,000,000 plant , as light and airy as any in the country . They set up recreation facilities , a vacation clubhouse , took to calling employes Pilgrims , put a name plate at every worker 's post . In 1921 they began letting all employes buy stock . By 1937 employes owned over 50% . Mr. Bancker having died the year before , they were also offered his 25% , leaving Mr. Dann only 25% . The price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now $26 . Gus Anderson has accumulated 1,000 shares .
