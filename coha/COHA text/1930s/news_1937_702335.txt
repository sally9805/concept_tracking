txt Great ' Britain is committed in world politics to the development of security , but she " could not undertake to buy off trouble " by offering trade concessions to aggressive nations in an effort at economic pacification , Walter Runciman , President of the Board of Trade of Great Britain , declared yesterday . Mr. Runciman arrived at Boston aboard the Anchor liner Caledonia for a visit with President Roosevelt , which will follow a four-day stay in New York . He oame to this city last night by train and went 1 , to the St. Regis . Mr. Runciman , who , with Mrs. Runciman , will be a house guest of the President at the White House over the week-end , emphasized that he was ' here " on a holiday , not a mission , " and that his remarks were the private opinions of a British parliamentarian ' and Cabinet member on a vacation . Earlier , in an interview with reporters who met the ship in Boston Harbor , Mr. Runciman remarked , in response to a question about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If all the former German colonies were now under the German flag it would not create a revolution in Germany 's prosperity . " Follows Conciliation Move No nation was identified in Mr. Runciman 's declaration on concessions as an offset to aggressiveness. : However , he carefully chose his words in making the tittlit4iMent , Which came Shortly after Farbl hid begun a conciliation move in an ultimate plan said to involve a general European settlement , including colonial redistribution . " That would certainly not be a correct interpretation of British foreign policy , " he said . " We are not going to make that the method by which we are going to conduct foreign policy . " We are not going to bribe artybody to leave us alone . You know well enough what it means to those who pay tribute  --  demands for more and . more tribute . I do n't think I 'll go further than that . " The British take satisfaction in the belief that their steps in international trade are an antidote to extreme nationalism , he said . Nationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world that it has carried exclusive nationalistic feeling too far , " he said . " We pride ourselves on our trade agreements ; we feel- that in them we have done something to counteract extreme nationalism . ? We have concluded agreements with some twenty-three nations , a pretty considerable number , covering a very large area of the world . " ' Mr. Runciman indicated , however , that in the efforts to restore foreign trade , the British had no intention of reviving the policy of undertaking to finance their own sales abroad , a policy which in the leading capital-exporting nations just before the world depression resulted in defaults , and consequent dis- location of -the-international capital market . " We can not embark , " he said , " on the sort of negotiations of six or seven years - ago for trade financed-on. the - London money market . We are- ready to ' sell- to whoever can buy , - but ' there can be no selling without payment . " A ? possible Anglo-American trade agreement , monetary stabilization , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference were touched upon- by the British Cabinet member in his conversation of more than an hour with - his interviewers while the Caledonia was proceeding to her East Boston pier . Mrs. Runciman sat- by his side in the stateroom . Capacity Is " Unofficial " He emphasized repeatedly that he was speaking unofficially and that his visit had no connection with that of Sir Otto Niemeyer , a director of the Bank of England , who , he said , probably was coming on business for the Bank . He came to the United States on the invitation of President Roosevelt , he said . " President Roosevelt extended an invitation to me , together with Mrs. Runciman , to spend a few days on a purely private visit , " he said . " The President was kind enough to offer us the hospitality of the White House and that is , naturally , a compliment likely to be dealt with with the greatest respect . " The President and I have a great many friends in common , and some of the most prominent of our statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his visit was connected with the exploratory conversations on a possible AngloAmerican trade agreement . " There have been conversations ? they are going on all the time  --  but I they have nothing to do with my visit here , " ! he said . " I 'm not here to talk , I 'm going to do a lot of listening . " He added : " As you know , the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom are very cordial and if that can be interpreted into good trade relations , naturally everybody would be gratified . " But I do not anticipate anything ? in the nature of a trade treaty coming from my ? visit to the United States . " Asked if he might discuss the war debts situation with President Roosevelt , he replied : " God forbid . I do n't think it the least likely . " Mr. Runciman was informed of reports that linked up his visit with talk of the extension of de facto stabilization on a more permanent basis , including legislative continuance of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tripartite arrangement was undertaken a few months ago by France , the United States and ourselves , " he said , referring- to the understanding that enabled the French to carry through long-delayed devaluation of the franc . " I am not going to presume to intrude on matters of United States policy . " This I can say , however : All artificial means of stabilizing exchanges are dangerous . The stabilization of currencies arrived at by the agreement of three months ago is giving an atmosphere of security in international trade that is invaluable not only to the parties to the agreement but the wdid at'large . " Mr. Runciman declined to discuss , whether the British followed that section of American opinion which believed that the success of the President 's plan for achieving a balanced budget was a prerequisite to international stabilization . " It would be wrong of any British Cabinet member to express an opinion of American fiscal or financial policy , " he declared , " and it would never be thought of by me . That policy is your affair and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is being said on the subject , but I think you can take it that we are not going to intrude into regions that concern others than ourselves . " Sees No Trade Parley Soon The British statesman said he saw no immediate prospects for a new international economic parley . " A world economic conference is no good unless it achieves something , " he said . " Merely to hold a conference for the fun M holdingl it is not contemplated in British policy . There is a possibility , of course , of a conference coming to something . But I do not see any immediate prospects of conversations on that subject . " He praised the recent Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace held at Buenos Aires for the " remarkably friendly feeling between the various American States , which I hope will be only to the good in the future for the world . " " If North and South America remain peaceably inclined , " he added , " it is bound to have an enormous effect on the peace of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looked to in some quarters to show the same concern about the peace of the world , he replied : " Whatever the United States sets her heart to , she can carry further than any other nation in the world . " ? Discussing the trade situation in the Far East , he said he saw no reason why Japan or any other nation should be a menace to British trade in China or India . " China is large enough for the best trade relations with Japan as well as the United Kingdom , " he I added . Mr. Runciman 's ship docked at 3 o'clock and his train for New York left at 4 . He devoted all but the last few minutes of the liour to sightseeing in Boston . On reaching New York Mr. Runciman and his party emerged from the Pullman at 9:15 o'clock last night and went to the St. Regis Hotel where he will stay through Friday . He is due at the White House Saturday . Mr. and Mrs.1 Runciman were accompanied by his secretary , J. R. C. Helmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent of the Anchor Line in America .
