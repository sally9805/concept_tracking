End of Bank of Italy . Stoutest of all advocates of branch banking is Amadeo Peter Giannini , and classic example of a bank-with-branches is the Giannini-founded , Giannini-expanded Bank of Italy National Trust &; Savings Association . California-wide institution . Last week it was revealed that soon Bank of Italy will succumb to the same forces of expansion and merging which it created . As soon as details are worked out , Bank of Italy will merge with Bank of America of California , newer Giannini institution . The new bank will be called Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association , will have resources of $1,350,000,000 , will stand fourth in size among U. S. banks . It will have 453 branches , 292 of which will be contributed by the $1,000,000,000 Bank of Italy . Closely cooperating in all things , but not a part of the merged banks except in that Transamerica Corp . has 60% of its stock , will be the 35-branched Bank of America National Association , New York . <P> In the passing of the greatly famed name " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Transamerica management to remove any local , partisan significance attached to the Giannini structure . Mr. Giannini himself saw this was essential and , shortly after old Bancitaly stock crashed , the company was succeeded by Transamerica Corp . Yet Transamerica is influential in Italy through control of the Banca d ' America e d'ltalia which only last week expanded further through purchase of the seven-branched Banca-Italo-Britannica . <P> In last week 's deal-plans is evidence that Transamerica 's management still believes nation-wide branch banking is sure to come , prepares for it . <P> Kreuger in Ericsson . Undoubtedly most famed of Swedish companies is Ivar Kreuger 's Kreuger &; Toll Co. , holding company for Swedish match , international banks , large mines . But a close second is L. M. Ericsson Telephone Co. which wages successful battle against German 's Siemens &; Halske on one hand , International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . on the other . Good news in Sweden last week was the announcement that Ivar Kreuger has obtained a large block of Ericsson stock , that Kreuger &; Toll will direct its many activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. , recently reported angling for Ericsson , and against which an " Ericsson protective committee " was formed by patriotic Swedish tycoons . <P> Ericsson makes telephone equipment , operates telephone systems . It has plants in many countries , concessions in Italy , Poland , Turkey , Esthonia , Mexico , Argentina . In Herr Kreuger &; associates it will have the benefit of the shrewdest concession-operators in the world . <P> Standard of New York . Through its subsidiary , General Petroleum Corp. , Standard Oil Co. of New York is potent on the west coast , has strengthened its position through the purchase of many a small independent marketer . Last week General Pete acquired A. M. Mortensen , Inc. , large distributor of San Jose , Calif . Brand name of General Pete 's gasoline : Violet Ray .
