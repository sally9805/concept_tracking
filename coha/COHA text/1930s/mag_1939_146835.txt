Few top-flight comic strips are today consciously comic , few still appeal primarily to children . Like movies and pulp fiction , they are mostly simple narratives for the unsophisticated of all ages . First comic-strip character to find high adventure in Europe 's war was the Register and Tribune Syndicate 's Jane Arden girl reporter for a mythical newspaper . <P> When the war broke , Artist Russell Ross and Author Monte Barrett scrapped cuts and continuity prepared six weeks in advance , hastily gave Jane Arden a war assignment . On her way by plane this week to the neutral kingdom of Anderia , while real correspondents were chafing because they could not get to the front , Jane Arden was caught between the lines . <P> First in another field was NEA Service , when in Texas-born Roy Crane 's Wash Tubbs native girls were pictured dancing naked though mud-daubed ( see cut ) , on a South Sea island .
