For short , swart Gene Sarazen , open champion of Britain , open champion of the U. S. , there remained this year only one more province of the professional golfing world to conquer-the U. S. professional championship ( match play ) which he has won two times since 1922 . Last fortnight , officials of the Professional Golfers Association , eager to have Sarazen in the field , offered to qualify him automatically . Sarazen , against anything that might make his record less than perfect , declined . Last week he went to the Rockville Centre Country Club ( L. I. ) to play in the sectional qualifying round for one of the 14 places in the New York District . His putting was wobbly , his irons erratic . His 152 , eight over par for two rounds , left him tied with six other professionals for the last two places in the 14 . In a " sudden death " playoff , John Golden and two Turnesa brothers won the last three places with birdie threes on the first hole . Sarazen 's birdie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the list of qualifiers unless one of them , possibly Charley Lacey , his assistant at Lakeville Country Club , withdraws before the tournament begins next fortnight in St. Paul .
