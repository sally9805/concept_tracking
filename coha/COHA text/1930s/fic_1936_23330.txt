CANARY SONG BY GUSTAV ECKSTEIN C NE twilight there was a tone so dif- ferent that , though 1 was hard at work , I heard it . It was not like canary song  --  more a stir of air . Which bird ? When I looked it seemed each time that that odd music ceased , and when I ceased to look was there . Finally I knew  --  Chicken . On the left side of his face Chicken has a shadow so faint that for a long time I did not see that shadow , and always had trouble pointing it out to anyone else . Well , pale as that shadow this tone was . To make it Chicken had to keep his bill wide open , and you knew but you could not see till you got right up to him that there was motion in that bill . An unbelievable rapid quivering . The result in tone was a vibration , a trembling , something new in music , something that you could not at first recognize was made up of separate notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition , once you truly heard it , distinct and pointed , but like the ghost of a note . Where except in his own mind could the little bird have heard anything like that ? This all occurred , as I say , one twilight , and I thought regretfully that that was perhaps the last of it . I knew how musically inventive canaries are . They often make some small discovery that you hear every now and then through an afternoon and the next day is gone . But the next day Chicken 's new invention was still there . Indeed , had he heard it in his mind ? I mean , was it from his ancestors ? Hadhe inherited it ? Or had he actually heard it with his earthly ear ? Could it be that that was the way Chicken 's ear took in the note of a mouse traveling through a concrete wall ? There were always mice in the walls , and sometimes at night they would come out into the open ; a canary would be on one side of a seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canary head dip , then the mouse head dip , I always uneasy , but neither bird nor mouse uneasy . A mouse 's tone , however , is higher in pitch , squeaking in quality , the notes not evenly spaced , and not with anything like Chicken 's speed . Chicken 's was more like some insect , only there arc no song-making insects in the building except crickets , and the crickets are in the basement four floors below . Furthermore , there are no crickets in winter . I had given up thinking of this when again one twilight , the building silent , I was just able to make out down the hall and through two doors the noise of someone 's noiseless typewriter . Just able . Just a stir of air and at that distance not unlovely . I had never heard this before , and the only reason I heard it now , I think , was because my ears were prepared by Chicken 's tone . I could not escape believing there was a connection . In a month I was convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances that hard machine had almost the same quality as this little bird 's vanishing music . The music was like a breath made visible by cold . What I knew was that I must hence-forth be very careful in deciding what a canary can hear . Perhaps a canary can hear things even much fainter than Chicken was hearing . Perhaps even that was the origin of some of what I thought invention . Chicken 's invention he used as a beginning each time , from it broke into his bigger and more ordinary but still comparatively small song . And I must be careful also in deciding what a canary can make of what he hears ; because whoever listened to Chicken 's melody agreed that it was a music of most mysterious beauty . The bird in the egg must hammer its way out , and that hammering has often been heard . But more than that , the unborn bird complains down there in the cramped dark , and that complaint also has been heard . But most unexpected , that unborn bird alone in his shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least it has been claimed by one of the best of all observers that in several kinds of birds when the mother issued a warning call the chick in the egg was still . How this interesting observation was made I did not know , but naturally I should like also to have been present at such a scene . Should like to have listened as discreetly as possible to those earliest conversations between mother and chick , thus perhaps to clear my mind a little farther as to the nature of bird speech and bird song . This a clever young friend of mine was kind enough to make practical by supplying me with a small microphone that I was able to place in the sieves where the mothers had their nests . I could keep at my work , the telephone receivers on my head , and the mother bird would not be frightened , though I was as close to her and her eggs as if she had built her nest in my ear . I did not hear that complaint of the unborn bird , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pauses , the stirrings of the mother  --  like stirrings of silk , heard the crash of the father 's feet as he landed on the fishpoleor even right on the edge of the sieve , heard the chick just after it came out of the shell , maybe when it was coming out . And off away at a distance I heard the Community  --  noises of a city from a hilltop . Strange it was , I tell you , to be part of all the excitement of such a little household during these tense hours and days . Without this quite indecent nosing , without this help from the machine age , without my microphone I could hear nothing of the chicks the first day they were out of the shell . To know they were out was fairly easy . The tension that is round a nest was each time broken , like heavy weather by rain . The mother would be away more often , still had to keep the chicks warm but yet was freer to dash about the neighborhood . Each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine ! and only then slide down over the top of them . The neighborhood itself would have an increased curiosity , and I remember how a mother who had been disappointed in the outcome of her own eggs moved very close and looked down at another mother 's successful babies , suddenly to be driven off by the possessive father . But no chick did you hear on the first day , not even when the mother and the father both were pounding food into mouths that you knew were wide open and from which , the microphone had taught you , were coming the earliest faint peeps of hunger . And no peeps on the second day , or the third . On the fourth you might still in some cases be uncertain , and it was determined much by the distance of the nest , but on the fifth there were the unequivocal sounds , weak at first but gathering strength from hour to hour . To recognize these was easy . Every fifteen minutes you could point and say : " There proceeds a feeding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and earlier , you were quite able by the shades in the quality of the peeps to know that those in that nest were individuals , not merely members of a species , persons not canaries . The male sings to serenade the female , as everybody knows . The male perhaps also sings for the other reasons that we sing  --  to make a bigger and more important noise than his neighbor , to put into the air something that he is creating or thinks he is creating , and he seems to sing to be rid of a mood . In fact , the male and the female both ; but especially the female 's small and infrequent song seems mostly to exist for that last reason , to be rid of a mood . Finally , song is used like speech , where now and then what has happened demands such strong expression . Serenade may be from a distance , or it may be close into the lady 's ear . Serenade into the ear is naturally the more passionate , begins with a rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means to excite . It is a swift vigorous trill , usually fairly high in pitch , and no decorations on it , and sung with such heat that you do not feel the bird quite to be hearing what he is singing . Appetite in tone is what it is . When I heard that kind of serenade break forth I could shut my eyes and paint the picture . I could see the little male 's growing burning , see him moving nearer and nearer , his body rigider and rigider , and if then the song was abruptly cut off I could see that she had flown away and that he was standing as if he had lost a friend . Indeed , anyone who has once been present at this drama could close his eyes and to the accompaniment of the music build in the plot . Serenade from a distance , on the contrary , was always more what one thinks of as serenade , more as if she were concealed behind a curtained window and he had the object of his song rather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that she would often be quite out of sight , perhaps down under the radiator working at some serious problem of her race . Thus you mightsee him there alone and think that he was merely singing for the sake of the song , but that was only before you had listened much to canary song ; because though the melody might be the same the feeling was so different . The appearance of the singer was different too , who always in serenade looks a good deal the strong wish that he has in him . Sometimes it would happen that this serenade from a distance would be broken upon by another singer , singing very possibly to another vision , and in that way a singer contest arise , Meistersingerfest , the original inspirations in the course of the contest entirely forgotten . But more often the serenade from a distance would simply excite the singer to go out on the gross search for her , and the serenade change to that where the singer sings straight into the beloved 's tiny feather-covered ear . Often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low tones . Lieder is what you then felt . Saturday afternoons the College would have been quiet for hours , and you could count on this happening at least then . Lieder  --  short songs , low tones , small volume , gentle quality . And Lieder these songs remained unless the singer was excited by someone 's interrupting song . If on these Saturdays you observed the singer 's body you would see how relaxed , very different from that typical one of Puck 's , no swaying from side to side , no rising on legs . Chicken and Chicken-like 's singing was Father 's kind of singing , because Father taught them both , but especially Chicken 's was much dreamier than Father would ever have let his get . Certainly the song felt as if the singer were working off a mood . He was not thinking of a lady . The psychologist may say that there was a lady in Chicken 's subconscious , as in our subconsciouses , and I do not mind ; but there was no lady near Chicken , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The other birds sometimes sang in this way too and at this hour . Several times also at midnight , with only my table light burning , everything still , suddenly from the vicinity of the half-fishpole over the third window there would be a voice , a stirring voice , strong from the first note , only a half dozen phrases , then everything still again . Most liquid notes . A little bird 's dream , is what you then felt . I have said that serenade might end in a singer contest . And a song that began as a mere getting rid of a mood might end in a singer contest too , strain come into the voices , the pitch rise , and in a minute or two everything be altered . The space between the bird 's breathings would have lengthened , and a single breath sometimes last for an unbelievable time . It is difficult for the human singer to hold a big tone for as much as three-quarters of a minute ; yet when a canary is driven by competition he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this is astonishing because a canary breathes so much faster than we  --  ninety to one hundred and twenty times in the minute against our twelve to eighteen . You would expect the canary to have to get his next breath so much sooner . It is almost impossible to count those breaths even ordinarily , and when the excitement of song is on him he does not want to stop at all to breathe , and it is said that birds have ruptured blood vessels and have died in such a competition . What happens commonly is that into this contest of two singers another , then another , is drawn , till what may have begun as a kind of reading of poetry becomes a fierce chorus of battling voices . Father called home the lost canaries with song . That use of song I had never heard before , but it was of course speech , stirring speech . The call-notes that many times a day went between husband and wife were certainly also the elements of song . Then there were the bits of tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into work orplay , like remarks . Then there were the various cries , the cry of the mother to her fledglings , of a leader to the Community , or the combatants in a combat ? this often simply one insistent high note . Then the warnings that rose up day and night . Then when in the morning I would have forgotten to buy seed , and the bowls were empty , and I would come in the evening and still have no seed  --  there would be a speech then too . All would meet me at the door . All would tell me with utter plainness  --  higher and lower voices , but absolutely the same idea . Much communication was , of course , by deed . Then there was a sort of talk that went on between the birds and me , especially between Whitehead and me , and that Whitehead herself often started . She would never take time for it during the day , but toward evening when she was tired she would sometimes place herself on a branch of the first tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note . It might take a long time till I heard and answered , but when I did she would promptly answer me , encourage me to keep up this talk . I would even be permitted to move to within a yard of her and even to look at her , and the conversation go on usually for as long as I was willing . Sometimes my tone would follow hers , sometimes hers mine , most often a not very Ioud whistling . It was a form of communication that communicated , to be sure , nothing more definite or important than friendliness . A canary sings themes like ours , is able to carry them up and down the scale as we do , and to put together several to make a song . To me a canary song is all that a canary sings inside one canary breath . He may wait after that breath , or he may repeat his song , or he may start on something new . But what to me is a song to some other ear may seem only a phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , to a judge 's ear at a canary prize competition a song is something made of rolls and tours , the rolls those passages where the movements from one key to another are fused , and the tours those that have a number of distinct musical figures . I have counted within one canary breath as high as thirteen themes , and the canary did not seem very used up . As to the theme , often it will be nothing more difficult than the same note repeated . More often it will be the same trill repeated . But it may be a broken chord , or some more intricate pattern of rhythm and tone , or it may be some few notes out of a musical scale that you easily recognize and think of as ours , the human scale , and the question has been raised whether the bird learned his scale from us or we from him . Impossible to answer that , though more or less musical noise is what we are in the habit of connecting with primitive man , and song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those commoner themes that occur over and over , that you hear through windows , or in someone 's sitting room , that everybody without paying special attention knows , and as you go through life you add to your list . But that is by no means all that the canary has . You need only to go on listening to realize how constantly the imagination of the single bird is making slight variations on that comparatively small number of original themes , and soon you find yourself much more interested in hearing how he does that than in naming and cataloguing those basal themes that no doubt are inherited fully formed , and that the bird one day early in life bursts forth with . On a cold afternoon I heard Striped Male sing a theme that I had often heard from the wild birds down in the dump ? two notes with an evening quality and about midway between Striped Male 's highest and lowest , and followed by one note that glided upward . This was late winter , so it was months since there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered over allthat time and not sung , and now was sung . About half a week later Striped Male increased those two evening notes to three , and this did in an amazing way change the feeling of this theme  --  just as if in the first movement of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony you were to play four instead of three repetitions of that immortal note . Before the week was over Striped Male had increased the three to five . In a month he did not sing the theme at all any more . Another twilight there was something almost as cattish in quality as a cat bird , then I never heard it again . Another twilight there was one long-sustained hoot , not like an owl 's yet giving to the mind the same desperate feeling . It was sung several times , then I never heard it again . 1 need hardly add that a canary 's voice is a canary 's voice whatever the theme and variations . When you first go to Russia what you hear is a fairly monotonous repetition of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of the great Pushkin might for a long time represent too slight a variation on that for you to distinguish . Indeed , I have no doubt that to an ear as far from ours as ours from a canary the inventions of Bach are utterly lost . So , what you hear first is the quality canary , next certain melodies sung by all canaries , next not the quality canary and not the melodies sung by all canaries because finally you are listening to the one bird singer . And even to the human ear that one bird singer is at least as much an individual in his song as in the detail of the design on his feathers , or his way of springing to a branch , or his way of treating his neighbors . As to the naturalness of these voices , we all know that we never feel the uneasiness with a bird voice that we feel with even the finest human singer  --  the fear that some note may crack . As to the carrying power , that you can scarcely believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Sunday morning when the air was still to recognize Puck 's voice . And several persons who are not accustomed to listening have told me that downstairs when they entered the building they heard my canaries , and that means one long hall , three flights , another long hall , a turn , and still another long hail . It ought to he said too that you can only barely hear the human voice unless it is loud even when the person is right outside the laboratory door . So song-sensitive is the canary that I have known a moment of silence to start him into song . I have known the same effect from the unexpected brightening of a voice in the course of a dull human conversation . A friend was translating , a monotonous succession of sounds and rests , then the translating went over into talk  --  instantly two on the west half-fishpole began to sing . This was at nine o'clock at night . The striking of a match I have known to be enough . All light after dark . So song-sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but the common stimuli are the typewriter , the radio , the piano , the hum of a machine , the slightest ring of the telephone , dripping water , the loud laughter of some negroes down in the dump , a sparrow on the windowsill , the canaries ' own talk , a rival 's approach , the sight of the mate , the sight of any female whatsoever . At the bird store to start his males singing the proprietor rubs a sand shovel on a tin can . Females sing . They sing more rarely , their repertoires are shorter , their voices smaller and of a quality that does not attract attention  --  but they sing . Frequently the song is no more than a pipe followed by another pipe . One of the females would always sing high C , then a third above high C , then a rest , then G in the octave below . After many repetitions of this theme , for her very last note , she would rise to C the octave above high C. This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ octave up . Usually the female did not sing till late in the day , in the springtime not till several hours after dark , the hard-worked bird sleepy but wishing none the less a bit of song before she went to bed . You would see the spaces on either side her throat fill with air just the way the male 's do , only a small swelling instead of a big one , and the tone that resulted would often have that feeling too , as if it wished to be big and were not succeeding . I have heard it said that the female is more apt to sing during her widowhood , but I have not observed it . On Sundays when the New York Philharmonic would begin to come over the radio the whole spirit of the place would change . Rossini , Beethoven , Wagner would make a happy canary program , particularly if the Beethoven happened to be the Pastorale . And that would make a happy Toscanini program too . The radio stood against the south wall between the windows , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in that box . This gave to the laboratory out in front of the box the feeling of having grown much bigger ? of being a great hall with the singing canary audience all around the edge of the balconies of it . Hinge would be high to the back on the fishpole . Hinge always occupied the same place . Sometimes he would sing uninterruptedly through an entire concert , which meant the full two hours , because Hinge sang also through most of the intermission , There would be Sundays when there were breaks in his concentration because he could not get his mind off some female , or some annoyance at a male , anything ; but on those Sundays when his being was calm he would surpass the others to a point that made him seem another species of bird . Father , you always would decide then , had not wasted his time on Hinge in spite of Hinge 's lazy ways . As the Toscanini program mounted to its glory Hinge would show an in. creasing freedom . He would not look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come over us all . There was something of sky and ocean  --  in the face of the scientists . Below Hinge on the book-closet would be Striped Male , in his old place , from which he sang his fatal concert five years before , but no thought of equaling Hinge now , just a modest pleasure in singing along with the others . To the right of the hall on the desk might be Chicken , usually to be joined after a while by Chicken-like  --  both much less dramatic singers but listening very carefully to what the orchestra was playing , keeping very close to it , especially Chicken , who had a finer and finer voice . On the other side of the hall , on the instrument case , frequently the striped ones all together  --  Junior , Penguin , Striped . Male  --  with the striped females on and off joining them , Junior and Penguin facing partly toward each other and partly down toward Mr. Toscanini . A tier lower than they , on the chemical bench , would be Crusty 's Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already so big that you would wonder whether he might not be the offspring of some secret pledge with Hinge . The other males would be strewn wherever they happened to alight , and there would be a good deal of changing of places during the concert ; but the singers on the whole would continue in a great semicircle low on the sides and rising high to Hinge at the back , the hundred-man New York orchestra down in the bowl in front of them . Fabulous canary singing on those fabulous Sundays . All the males would sing , often a female . Once Striped Daughter sang through half a concert . It was that heavenly Sunday when great Toscanini played the Ninth Symphony ? took Scuola Cantorum , Metropolitan soloists , Philharmonic Society , wrenched them out of themselves , or back into themselves , I do n't know which , but for that hour made them into something that you did not remember them to have been , something diabolic and mad that cracked the dark and let us who were listening see the outlines of Beethoven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this canary singing was not speech , not the giving vent to a private mood , not love-making , not the inexorable path of sexual selection . No , these tiny birds with their tiny voices on those Sunday afternoons came very near to man 's own high conception of art for art 's sake , song for songs sake , the creation of impersonal beauty .
