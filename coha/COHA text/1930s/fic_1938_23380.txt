FORTY-THIRD DIVISION A STORY IN TWO PARTS . PART I BY RALPH BATES MHE snow was harder and crunched 1 under their feet above the granite outcrop and they rested , facing the Dome of the Anew peak , screwing up their eyes against its brightness . The wind rising out of the valley beyond the peak was driving plumes of snowdust up into the intense blue sky . On their side , however , the air flurries were soft and warm from the granite blocks . Agustin , the younger of the two scouts of the 43rd , the " lost " Division , made several attempts to drive his axe shaft into the snow . " How lovely , " he exclaimed , " Pere , do you see ? If you make a hole in the snow it seems to fill up with blue light . Oh , lovely ; soft light , you can see it pour in like a liquid . " He ran about the ridge jabbing holes . The black-bearded Pere laughed , but he was pleased with the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff on their left . In the gloomy amphitheater below the peak were coils of mist , slowly rising . " Eh , Agustin , the Malibierna Pass is just the other side , in the direction of that cairn . Eh , blast you , listen . We must godown the East Ridge . " The boy came running toward him , shielding his eyes ; sun-smitten ice glittered on the East Ridge . " Pere , the light in the holes is the same color as the snow lakes , amethysts , dissolved in . . . " A rifle cracked , thin and feeble in the rarefied air . " Oh , Pere , " the boy choked , and twisted as he fell . He lay still upon his back . Pere flung himself down and fired at the cairn . A bee droned by , blown up from the lush spring valley of the Ribagorzana . Quickly he raised himself and dropped as he saw the flicker of movement on the peak . The bullet swished over his head toward the Cursed Glacier . Lying upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he crawled back to the dead boy and turned him over . He had transferred the rations to his own sack when he heard a scrunch on the snow . Standing boldly , tall and slender , silhouetted against the sky , was the Enemy , lifting his rifle . Both men fired and missed . The Enemy flung himself down behind the hump . Pere was dashing forward when he remembered , without conscious thought , that there were rocks beyond the snow hump . The Enemy would have cover . His own position was determined ; on his right the snow plunged down five hundred feet to the blue-green crevasses . He crawled back to the dead boy and took his ammunition , the binoculars , and the ice axe ; and retreated three yards and stood up . Again the Enemy missed . Raging , Pere lifted his rifle , but the Enemy had already begun to drop . Slinging his rifle and lying flat , Pere pushed himself down the steep slope . As he shot down and his hissing snow-wake rose high , he turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point into the snow . As he stopped the axe grated among the nodules of icy snow that preceded the naked ice . Quickly he cut steps down and across the Dome 's north face . He noted that the wind was blowing chill up the Esbarrans Valley . Gaining the foot of the great rock bluff of the Aneto North Ridge , he climbed swiftly to its summit and with the binoculars searched the peak and the knife-edge leading to it , staring past the black mark on the snow hump . Pere waited four hours . The north wind from France pushed heavy , canvas-hued clouds over the frontier range . Tongues of mist stuck out of the gaps in the frontier crest . The shadows sponged out the glacier 's brilliance and the peaks blackened . The Enemy never approached the dead boy . A burst of hail rattled on the granite as Pere climbed down . His will had frozen round one determination . He reached the moraines as snow , a few gray flakes , began to drift in the brusque eddies ; by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was falling with a faint hissing sound . At other times this would have caused him to hasten , but now he dawdled along the Esbarrans torrent course  --  toward the Aygualluts pasture , below the Cursed Peaks , where they had left their blankets  --  brooding over the boy 's death . Agustin , a young graduate of Barcelona University , had been working with Pere for nearly a year , and latterly had become a kind of assistant to him . One night , during the retreat , the boy had been of inestimable service to Pere , then operating with a rear-guard harassing company . He had suggested a movement which had enabled Pere to withdraw two hundred and twenty men given up for lost , the remains of a bombed battalion . Until recently Agustin had never been happy in the army , having been in constant trouble with the brigade authorities . Pere believed that he had always desired to be with him because Pere himself was something of a problem to the authorities . For a while , on account of natural cornbativity , Pere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had undone much of his work , which he disliked . His indiscipline had finally disqualified him and his party had removed him . He had joined that party soon after the outbreak of the rebellion , not because of philosophic conviction , but because he approved its general war policy . Pere , a solitary , violent man of about forty years , had little patience with the problems of morale and adjustment , with which a commissar must occupy himself . Following this , he had done some fine skirmishing with a picked force against the Moors on the Sierra de Alcubierre . Again , he had so resented the strategical control of his work by the Staff that he had been asked by his party to surrender his commission . He had done so after a stormy scene with the Commissar , whom he had threatened . He had fought magnificently during the retreat , when organization had broken down ; leading shock parties back against advanced enemy forces , often working within the enemy offensive itself . For this he had been given the rank of lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the past fortnight , since they had been driven into the high mountains , Pere had again done splendid work as a scout . His mountaineering skill fitted him for that lonely work . Operating with a small unit , largely self-supporting , he was tireless and full of initiative , and had given firstrate protection to the " lost " Division . In order to be with him Agustin had declared , falsely , that he was a skilled climber , though he had made but one ascent of a rock peak in the Beciberi range . Pere now reached their last night 's resting place , took Agustin 's blanket , and was about to set out for the overhanging boulder on the Maladetta pastures where he intended to sleep when an idea struck him . The Enemy above had been watching the Malibierna pass ; what was he doing there ? Were the fascists launching an attack on the 43rd from Benasque ? It would be a good route to the Ribagorzana Valley ; the southern slopes of the Cursed Mountains , running down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to warn the low-level scouts stationed in the valley before the Tonnele Pass . From Aygualluts to the pass by the Mulleres Valley was a three hours ' journey , and there were three hours of daylight left ; he set out at once . During the hour he was passing over the lower pastures of the valley he was thinking of Agustin , lying above on the white Dome , buried already under snow , heaping the snow up in a bank . .. the top of it would blow off into the spirals of falling snow . But he felt no deep sorrow ; sorrow had disappeared before the clean danger-of the snowstorm . Already , as he passed the last broad flats , speculation died out , for the gusts lifted serpents of snow before him . The ground was made treacherous by its thick , insubstantial covering of snow . There was a noise of wind above on the little Esbarrans peak on his right , like the banging of a vast cathedral door . The rumbling of the Mulleres stream on his left guided him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . And then suddenly the wind sheared through the snow and the hundred peaks boomed into the blind night . Hour after hour Pere fought his way to the pass , where huge sails of snow raced across the gap and broke against the ridge . Again and again the wind beat him down into the heaving snow and at last , near exhaustion , he hacked his way to the shallow crevasse between the cliff base and the snow field and there fell asleep , with the gale storming above him . When Pere awoke the full moon hung over the peaks he had left . He reached the pass with care and rested behind low rocks , startled by the beauty of the cordillera . Away to the west the sharp , sail-like peaks of the French frontier and the vast cliff of the Perdiguero stood clear but ghostly under the full moon . To thesouthwest was the snow desert of the Posets , where no one ever wandered ; and nearer , the Cursed Range itself , sharply outlined above the dimly shining glacier . He drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Range after range stretched away on three sides , now cloaked in nocturnal white ; their scribbled crests traced the finest of lines across a background of yet more peaks . The moonlight in the valleys between them seemed to be a faint mist rising out of blackness . On the slab-littered wilderness of the Mulleres , now a white dome , a torrent was flashing brightly ; he could see the water twisting in the moonlight , and its black course beyond the  --  eam . He turned and regarded the valley he must soon descend . It was black , utterly black . Above its black emptiness floated a snow-laced lower peak , bike a white suspended island . Beyond , the sprawling Beciberi and the Comolo Forno were like strange countries , suddenly perceived , or white palaces in the sky . He wanted others . . he wanted Agustin to see the cordillera now . " Pere , Pere , " the boy had cried , " the light in the holes is the same color as the snowflakes . " Savage hatred momentarily burned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes , amethyst-hued , turquoise where the floes had been pressed below the surface by the weight of snow slipping down the banks . Prussian-blue lakes with bergs floating upon them . " Pere , Pere , " the boy 's voice had cried , " it 's like amethyst dissolved in . . " What had he been going to say ? But that still landscape , so vast and solemn that it was neutral to man , gradually immobilized Pere 's emotions . He turned and slid down the first moonlit slopes and was swallowed up in the black depths . In the first grayness he found his comrades , challenging the sentry with a shout when within ten yards of him . " That 's bad , Carlos , " he said , shaking his head and frowning angrily . The scout made no answer , his expression admitting guilt . After a while the sentry said , " I saw you higher up , then I lost you . I could see it was you . " The others , awakening one by one , questioned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed his rifle against the wall . " Agustin 's dead , " he said . " One of their scouts shot him yesterday on the Aneto . " Everyone kept silence , thinking of Agustin . After a while , Pere said , " Where 's the Division ? Any report ? " " Same position ; yes , there 's a report . There 's a column of ours going to attack from Seo de Urgell , over the sierras into the Pallaresa Valley . " " Ah , going to relieve us , I suppose . " " Yes , our telegraphers have got the field wireless going again . " " Hope they do n't relieve us too soon . " " Why , Pere ? " It was the undertone in Pere 's voice which had prompted the question . " I am going back . " He nodded toward the pass . Jaime , the Madrid climber , asked , " Are you taking anyone with you ? " " No .. . but you 'd better make a visit every other day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . If I 'm not there traverse the ridges , by the Mulleres and the Salenques peak to the Salenques Pass . Bring what you can of rations for me and keep your eyes open . They have their scouts ; I reckon they 're stationed at the Renclusa refuge on the Maladetta . They wo n't send a force over the Salenques Pass but they might try the Malibierna . You go as far as that valley for the future , Enrique . It 'll be tough I know , but you must try . " Pere prepared his bed against the wall , while Jaime , pleased at being given high . level work , warmed soup for the leader . Others , getting ready for their day 's patrol , spread their blankets down for him . " When are you going to be back , Pere ? " Carlos asked . " When . . . " he began , " in a few days , I hope . " Jaime brought a hilly can of soup over to Pere 's bed , knelt down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like , Pere , up there ? " he said confidentially . " I was a fool not to think , " Pere answered . " I am to blame for it ; that peak will be their lookout center if they expect an attack or if they try one on us by that route . " " No , I meant the storm . I wish . . " " The storm ! Fine . . . you wish for a nice , romantic death in a blizzard while saving the Republic , do you , young fellow ? " " Eh , Pere ... steady , " the young climber exclaimed , crestfallen at the rebuke . " Soup 's good , fetch me some more , " Pere continued , knowing this would content the boy . " Who 's on guard here ? " " I am , " answered the man newly detailed . " All right , wake me in three hours , and do n't let me get shot , as Carlos would . " " I saw you higher up , Pere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my rifle , " grunted Pere . " But I did . . " The leader drew the blankets over his head and was silent . " I saw you by the hillock where the ruined cabin is . " Pere sprang up and glared at the man . " Cullonl Clean all the rifles for three days  --  for three months , " he shouted , striking Carlos a light blow . He lay down and covered himself , muttering . Carlos protested no more but showed resentment at the blow , and more than this , wounded affection . Some belonging to another party violently rebuked Pere . A few of Pere 's fellow party members began to murmur , and this restraint was only a sign of their greater hurt . One or two openly said that this behavior ill-befitted Pere , himself ever chafing at discipline . " But you 're to blame , Carlos , as well , " Jaime said . " If we take a different view of discipline you should n't abuse it . " The boy acknowledged his fault but unwittingly gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hit me because he 'll never send a fellow before the Brigade , " was his argument . Two days later Pere traveled from the valley ridge above Benasque  --  having noted the presence in that town of three enemy battalions , to the Col Tonneie ? to await Jaime . Swiftly moving clouds were streaming over the highest ridges from the southwest ; mists hid the valley floor . For a while he was hurrying along a corridor between the puffy grayness of the mist and the rafterlike clouds , from which fronds hung down , emaciated arms grasping through the clouds . Then as he pulled up the ruddle-colored slopes of the Malibierna peak the valley mists suddenly heaved and rose with stealthy speed and enveloped him . Silence settled over the mountain . The shell-like murmur of the air in the valley 's huge diapason was filtered out by the mist . The roaring of the water , swelling and diminishing as the gusts blew , no longer rose from the slopes . The click of stones beneath his nailed boots lost the sharpness of impact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moisture . There was little purpose in ascending a peak blind with clouds ; yet he made the height . Nearing the final ramps , he heard the click of stones as if men were approaching . Quickly he lay down and released the safety catch of his rifle , which he always carried cocked . The mists swirled , cold puffs of air ran up the dripping slope . The clicking stopped , but he heard a soft drumming as if the invisible enemy were passing over grass . Again the clicking began ; he wriggled himself into a secure position from which he could both leap and shoot . Silence again . There was a short cough and a sighing , higher up the slope , and a rattle of spilling scree stones behind him . " They 're going round me , " he muttered . He thought he saw a black form looming through the mist , and his left arm jerked the foresight up , and then the form was gone . The drumming was below him now , but nothing was visible . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He allowed five minutes to pass and then took off his boots andput on alpargatas , estimating meanwhile the exact location of the pass . Pere strode quickly in the direction of the pass and then , looking at the ground , quietly laughed . He slapped the butt of his rifle and put his head back and laughed roundly . " Of course , " he said aloud ; " Izard , a herd of izard . " The clicking had been caused by a herd of the Pyrenean ibex . Pere had often seen izards during his summer climbs but never at close quarters . The beasts had been as much puzzled as he , no doubt . They had been forced to leave their lower feeding grounds earlier than usual on account of the war ; they were going from the high slopes of Ribagorzana to the upper heights of the Esera Valley , by way of the Malibierna . He pictured them standing in the mists , nostrils distended , heads up , forefeet nervously treading the ground . The whole herd had halted , tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trembling , suspicious , across the dark slope . What had prompted them to avoid the spot where he crouched , dividing in two files ? He himself had experienced such sensations as they must have felt , in approaching the evil area , the malignant spot . . . . Still thinking of the invisible herd he continued his way to the Col Tonnele . Well before ten o'clock Jaime , the Castilian , appeared , working sensibly . He threw his arms round the leader and hugged him . " It 's good to see you , Pere . Hungry ? " " Cullon ! What have you brought ? " Pere ejaculated , regarding the great packet of food Jaime was pulling out of his sack . " The boys took a vote to allow you a part of their rations , Pere ... my Lieutenant . " The boy saluted . " All the boys , " he added . " Cullon , " grunted the older man . " But I 've got plenty left . " He was pleased that resentment of the blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridled at the implied censure . " You have ? " Jaime was disappointed that he could not give pleasure to his chief . The debate among the patrol had ended with the proposal Jaime had related . An anarchist had proposed it , and Pere 's party members had agreed . " Where 'd you sleep , Pere . . . . Oh , I forgot to say , your appointment has been confirmed by the war office , Lieutenant . " " Ah , ha , " murmured Pere , running his fingers through his beard . " Here 's a letter for you from Esquinazo , " continued Jaime . The men of the 43rd spoke thus of their colonel , calling him Antonio , or by his nickname : " Esquinazo , " the " Dodger . " Pere opened the letter ; it contained thanks for his good work and a request for fuller reports that savored of rebuke . " Culion , does he think there are copybooks and lakes of ink up here ? " Pere growled . Yet he knew that Colonel Beltran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the absence of any except verbal reports , but the scout felt that it applied to his present activities also . " But why ? " he thought . " I have ascertained that there are enemy in Benasque , I 've watched the passes , and they need watching . " " Why are you staying up here instead of superintending all the patrol routes ? " his conscience asked , and was promptly silenced . " Christ , " he said angrily ; " what 's he think I am , one of these literary soldiers ? " But the remark hurt him , for it brought the image of Agustin into a region of his mind which was sensitive to pain . Attached to the letter was a request for topographical information . " By what routes in your territory could an enemy force , stationed in the Val de Aran , reach the village of Aneto and its environs ? " " Ha , I had n't thought much about that ? " Pere said , pursing his lips . " Listen , Jaime , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have to stay up two days at a time . " " Oh , finel I say , Pere , these hills are better than the Guadarrama . " He gave Jaime explicit directions  --  told him what passes to watch and where to bring more food in order that he , Pere , might remain on the heights . He spoke cheerfully but was in a stubborn mood ; stubborn against a reproof which only he himself had administered . In his imagination he heard the Commissar 's voice saying , " Pere 's a good soldier ; he 'd be better if he 'd accept discipline at once . " " To hell with it , " he muttered , " I 'm as good a soldier as any of them . " He wished they would give hint a hundred men and tell him to bury himself in the hills and make war his own way . With these speculations he whipped himself into anger against authority ; and leaving Jaime , he climbed the Unnamed Peak to stare , from just beneath the streaming clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sight by the ceiling of cloud . Toward three of the afternoon when Jaime returned to their meeting-place , he found Pere writing . " Is that the re-port ? " Pere imagined that Jaime was commenting on the scantiness of the report and answered , with instantly checked irascibility , " Ca n't a man sleep sometimes ? Did you get a chance to see down the Toro before the rain came on ? " " Yes ; nothing there . I shall go up to the ridge to-morrow ; there 's no need to go to the pass itself . " As soon as Jaime had returned to the patrol with his brief report and the new instructions for the scouts , Pere set out over the Unnamed Peak for the Salenques Pass . Five days later , still brooding over a message from the Adjutant which Jaime had given him the day preceding , calling him to Divisional Headquarters , Pere was sitting in the shade , legs astride a rock , at the foot of the great Maladetta couloir . He was gazing idly down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of that wilderness of blazing stone the solemnity of the lake was star-ding . It was a black and malignant will , banished here and brooding . Tiny ripples , glittering like fish scales , seemed to lie motionless upon its surface . Not a tree nor a patch of grass was within sight , the lake lay concentrated and aloof . Above him the organ pipe of the couloir boomed in the wind . Pere started , his attention jerked to a movement at the far end of the lake . He took out the binoculars and focused them One , two , three  --  ah , the enemy  --  four , five . . . . There were fourteen or fifteen of the enemy filing round the lake . He fancied he heard the click of their boots . Quickly he made his plan ; indeed , he saw no alternative . On the north side of the Cursed Peaks are small crests of rock rising out of the glaciers ; crests constantly bombed by thunder and swept by drenching storms , dreaded by the herdsmen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , there is little snow , but the cliffs are much bigger . Almost at their highest point , between the Punta de Astorga and the Eastern Maladetta , these cliffs are split by a vast chimney , a strictly perpendicular grove of fifteen hundred feet , the Maladetta couloir . A severe climb on good granite for anyone wishing to ascend from the quivering heat of Gregono to the northern glaciers , and so by the sprawling north ridge of the Eastern Maladetta to the Renclusa refuge . Pere 's plan was simple . He would climb the couloir , station himself on the rocks below the Astorga , and wait for the enemy . Sweet Christ , if only the Enemy , Augustin 's slayer , is leading ) Ah , there was an impossible pitch in the couloir where one is forced to climb out on to the Great Tower wall by minute holds ; there , helpless on those fierce rocks , the Enemy would be located above perpendicular death ; spread-eagled before well-aimed extinction . Tying his boot laces tightly and adjust . ing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands on the rock ; there was affection in his fondling of the granite . He was bracing himself for the long tense effort ahead of him . The first pitch was a ten-foot wall where the legs could do little pushing , a mere inelegant . armpull . Above it lay aneasy staircase , gaining a hundred feet of height and leading back into the cold depths of the couloir . Rapidly he mounted the staircase and came face to face with the first difficulty . Before him the back of the chimney bulged outward , cold wet rock swelling outward for at least twenty feet ahead . The way past the obstacle was obvious but uninviting . The right wall was split by a crack which ran out toward the open face , gradually approaching a ledge which gave access to good holds by which he could climb above the bulge . To start upon the crack was the problem ; there were no holds within reach by which he could balance himself and pull over , and the last foothold of the staircase brought him so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of toppling backward . Well , that 's the problem , he considered , and without straining his nerve by waiting longer , put his left foot on the highest hold and slow-1y straightened his body . Gradually he could feel the poise of his stance diminishing as his head pressed against the bulge . Spreading his arm wide on the holdless rock , he strove to regulate his breathing ; for the swelling of his chest threatened to throw him down . His left leg began to tremble ; he had not dared to place more than the ball of his foot on the hold for fear of being too near the rock . He heard water dropping behind him , and the sound was ominous to his tense mind as slowly , slowly he straightened his body . Just as he felt himself overbalancing he thrust his right hand into the crack on the wall and clenched it within the fissure and rested . Safe now , he commented , and reached above his head with his left hand and found a wet hold . Then , shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right foot in the crack . " Hope the Enemy is really a good climber , " he thought when well out on the crack . Now he maneuvered to gain a broad ledge that ran back into the chimney wall above the bulge , and for a moment , groping above his head . his right hand emerged into the sun . The tiny sensation of warmth was grateful , but it broke his concentration by making him think of the Great Tower far above . The ledge was broad but he was forced to sidle along it ; the rifle barrel , colliding with the wall , threatened to fling him down the two hundred feet of echoing well . Again the mountain threatened to stop him . From the end of the ledge , with extreme difficulty , he balanced himself into a deep pulpitlike niche with a downward sloping floor of smooth ribs of stone . There seemed to be no exit from this niche , and he raged inwardly at his folly in being trapped . But surely this could not be the classical route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste to be out of the chimney . He hated the echoing couloir and the water dripping with faint noise of whirring wings . A man should climb out in the sun , upon dry rock , not in these threatening glooms . Below the hold , well to the left , was a waterworn knob of rock , protruding perhaps half an inch from the face . Well , nothing for it . His brain squeezed tight , expelling even consciousness of the mountain as he placed his right hand on the hold , lodged the best nails of his boot on the slippery knob , and lifted his body , left hand running like a swift lizard over the wail . Yes . . . no , it is not deep enough . . . only the first joints of his fingers would rest on the tiny ledge ; pulling on it would weaken his grasp on the j ughandle . Sweet Christ , his sweating fingers were slowly pulling off the ledge . No .. . desperately he clutched with his nails and fingerballs , feeling the chasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . . . yes . . . . He straightened upon the knob , and then as the new hold came in sight , just as his right hand was losing its security he slowly raised his other hand to another jughandle high on the left . Within twenty seconds he was standing upon safe holds at the foot of a clean arke , with dozens of notched holds all the way up its sharp back . He waited whilehis heart ceased to pound and joyfully scaled the ar  --  te without a moment 's halt for eighty feet of exhilarating climbing . " No nail marks on this pitch , " he noted ; " ca n't be the right route . " Taught by his mistake in accepting the invitation of the ledge , he considered a full minute before swarming up the blocklike crags that rested above the arete . There was no deception , however . The line of attack was continuous . Ah , there in the depth of the chimney was the chockstone everyone talked about ! " Big enough for a whole party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone . Soon the chimney opened out and he climbed with pleasant ease for three hundred feet . He had forgotten the Enemy and was once more the coppersmith of Lerida , on holiday among the peaks to be seen from the tower of his own city . Pere climbed out of the chimney on to the ample ledge on the left wall and walked out to the base of the Great Tower , in his heart a strange amalgam of elation and fear . Soaring upward for two hundred feet , was the Tower , its rich-hued granite glowing in the sunlight , lovely to his eye . He touched the rock with his fingertips , its hard grains were good to feel ; he rapped it with his knuckles , and struck it gently with the metal-shod toe of his boot . Solid , flawless granite , warm and blossoming in the sunlight . He was before the crux of his climb . All that he had overcome before was but preparation . He was fit now , his body limber , controlled and springy , his mind alight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to come . He glanced at his bootlaces , adjusted the rifle and touched the rock again , and his will , content in its daring , quickly closed over the first beautiful problem of the Tower , a classical and austere crack ascent . Pere slid his hands sideways into the crack , pressed with fingertips and the back of the hand against both sides of the crack , carefully twisted his left boot in the crack and lightly rose the first two feet . Left hand braced doubly firm while the right hand slid up the crack and expanded , and the left followed . Right foot came over left , felt for the crack , inserted itself and twisted , and his body rose again , not adhering to the vast wall by force of muscle , but by resting with perfection of balance on its minute holds : almost as if floating on that thousand feet of void below him . Right hand slid up the crack , left hand , left foot . . . . Right hand , left hand , right foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing motions . He was filled with serenity , his mind concentrated , co-ordinating the rippling movement of his muscles , judging precisely when to change his burden from leg to leg and arm to arm . At fifty feet the crack began to narrow and his will closed more tightly over the new problem , but there was no strain . He measured his fatigue , relaxed a few muscles whose effort was superfluous ; and was certain , yes ! he had more than enough in hand for the Great Tower . A sensation like the thrill of great music began to germinate within him . Without haste he laid his left hand upon the edge of the rock leaf and knew from that contact how safely he was climbing . Had he been afraid he would have felt relief at grasping the jughandle hold . He did not ; it was a passing feature of this lovely climb and no more . He jammed his foot in the crack and balanced springily upon it . Then , with no special resolution to do so , he leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice at the foot of the mighty couloir . Above the leaf was a deep recess in the wall , from which he balanced himself by small but trustworthy holds , and so reached the ledge without holds for his hands , so that he was compelled to move with calculated steps , his feet on the very edge of the shelf . Yes , he was moving easily . He rejoiced in the knowledge , which the climber 's censorship of his mind gently prevented from becoming too insistent , that behind him was the enormous whispering void . There was an interruption to the sensation of music as he moved along the shelf , not because of strain , but because that rare emotion was the product of his clean and economic conquest of height . " Ah , " he murmured , as the deep groove-like crack came into sight . His knees and arms raising his body again , the music welled up once more , clean , severe , like the theme of the contemplative " long " steps of a Sardana danced in a village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ahead , he saw the crux of the Tower , and without pause gently launched himself upon it . It was a roof , inclined at an angle of fifty degrees , of roughish granite , but completely without real holds after the first yard . A shallow crack , not half an inch deep , ran up to its sharp upper edge , beyond which rose a steep wall of some twenty feet . He could see no route up this wall , but boot-scratches told him other men had passed here . Arms straight out , almost parallel to his sides , palms downward , fingers turned back toward the abyss , a nail of his right boot biting stealthily at the shallow crack , resting his weight evenly upon the rough , clinging stone , he edged his body up the fearful slab . The music was an undertone now , a light perspiration was on his forehead . Upward , upward , not breathing when for ten seconds he must take his right foot out of that minute fissure . Ah , he saw the hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instantly realized that he dare not lift his palm from the rock , and continued his infinitely cautious movement up the roof . " Ah ! " he murmured , five minutes Tater , as his right palm edged over the hold and the nail of his boot re-bit the rock . Slowly , with a swimmer 's stroke , he brought his left hand round and it settled calmly upon the edge of the slab . The roof was conquered . Pere drew himself up and threw his leg over the edge of the slab , for between the roof and the wall there was a deep fissure . He had wont Sweet Jesus , he had wont The theme in his brain swelled and burst into exultation , into glory ; the blood rushed through his body , refreshing him ; he drew deep breaths and lifted his face to the light with closed eyes . Then , advancing along the roof crest , he rounded a corner by a swing on spikeholds , toed along an easy crack to the gap between the cliff and the Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed of the couloir offered no more serious obstades , he shinned schoolboy fashion , abandoning style , to the top of the Tower and gazed down on the wilderness of Gregofio and its solemn lake . He could see nothing of the enemy patrol ; they would be already engaged on the first pitches of the couloir . He allowed his gaze to wander . Beyond the dazzling hills of the Cinca foreground were the vaporous , petal-crested ranges . Pale-green hills , pale-gray ; hills faintly washed in with diluted sienna , ochre , and Venetian red ; and on the remote , legendary horizon the Sierra de Guara , a transparent stain of palest violet , almost invisible against the cobalt band of the lower sky . A cry far below stirred him to action and he moved swiftly into the couloir and climbed up through a draughty amphitheater , into which tumors of green-black ice dripped water , to the brilliance of the glacier . With few precautions he ran along the edge of the rimaye to a dip in the ridge , clambered across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a ledge behind a red granite spire , in order to get a clear vision of the Great Tower . Lovingly he observed every pitch of that face ; it was really one long pitch , the purest of joys . While he was still contemplating the Tower he heard a sharp ejaculation in the couloir and at once lifted his rifle to the level of his waist . Ah , he could wait till the enemy  --  Sweet Christ , let it he the Enemy  --  was at mid-height of the first crack and then he would call to him , and the Enemy would look over and see the rifle barrel lifting slowly , surely , to point motionless , straight at his neck . Sweet Christ , let it be the Enemy . Pere glancedat his safety catch and leaned against the spire . The voice shouted again in the couloir and then he heard the collision of an axe point against rock , and the voice said clearly , " This is the Tower . " He crouched behind the spire as a figure appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not the Enemy , but a shorter man . His vexation was tempered by the fact that a rope trailed behind the enemy . A roped party ! The leading enemy returned to the couloir and for a while the party held conference ; their voices only reached him as a hollow rumbling . Again the leader advanced and this time two others followed him ; the rape still trailed back to the couloir . A party of four . Pere watched the leader as he attacked the crack , and without grudging he mentally praised the enemy 's technic . Not quite mature , not mellow enough , but good and very daring , he judged , watching the sure though jerky movements of the leader . As the rope slack paid out , Number Two started up the crack . Also good . Now the fourth man advanced diffidently along the ledge , his hands fumbling at the rock . " Ha , ha , " murmured Pere , " beginner . " The beginner looked flinchingly down the sickening abyss and shouted in Italian , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it 's dangerous , very dangerous to-day . " A fierce glee entered him . " Hal " he exclaimed softly , " there must be Italians in the party below too . " All his hatred of the Italian enemy throbbed Iike a festering wound . The party 's tactical plan was obvious but mistaken . There was no belay in the couloir over which the rear man could pass the rope , thus safeguarding himself , and possibly Number Three . Therefore the party , with sufficient rope to cover the whole length of the Tower , had elected to accept the collective risk . Number One , they had reasoned , would reach the recess at the top of the roof slab and there , as Number Two would be on the ledge below the knee crack , he would be able to hold his Two and Three if the begin-ner fell . But if Two or Three failed at his problem before the leader reached safety .. That was the mistake into which the leader 's inexperience had betrayed him . He should have climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing up the whole rope to that point so that its weight should not pull him off the roof ; and then from the summit he could have brought up his whole party in absolute security , one at a time . Bad leadership , he commented , bad leadership will ruin everything . But to-day it makes no difference . Number Three started up the first crack , tense , working desperately . " It , It , " Pere clicked his tongue in surprise , " Well , senor leader , you 're risking it anyway . " Number One was on the terrible roof ! " Now , " whispered Pere and stood upright . " Ascolti , fascisti .. piacere , " he called in the dog-Italian an exile volunteer had taught him . Number Three ceased struggling in the crack ; the man on the ledge sought the origin of the voice , his face twitching. " anon giorno , " Pere said , lifting his rifle leisurely and aiming it at Number Two . Numbers Three and Four screamed harshly . Number Three stared down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still edging up the roof slab . Weakly the last man fumbled at his rifle strap . " No . . . piacere , " Pere commanded , lowering the muzzle toward him , and the man obeyed , standing , with distorted face , staring at the black-bearded , grinning figure across the couloir . Slowly Pere raised his rifle muzzle and took leisurely aim at the neck of Number Two , who put up a hand against the bullet . Pere lingered with his finger on the trigger , then gently , equally , his right hand squeezed on butt and trigger . The couloir thundered . Number Two crumpled , his head collided with the cliff , throwing him out-ward into the air . The rope coil sprang like a serpent , straightened , and Number One was whipped from the slab . He screamed chokingly as he soared out over the precipice . Number Three closed his eyes and crouched in the crack , screaming like a crushed beast . " Tang , " sounded the rope softly , and he was hurled from the Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already knelt upon the ledge and had lost consciousness . Whipping and revolving , the enemy plunged down the thousand feet of sunny precipice . Horrified cries came from the party in the couloir as they saw the leading group hurtle downward . Then silence . After the silence a voice whimpered and then another . The first whimpering voice began to weep and howl ; the man 's nerve was utterly destroyed . The animal howling agitated the sounding pipe of the couloir and it gave out monstrous wails of fear . Pere crept along the ledge and tried to catch sight of the enemy , but could not . " Go on , cry , little Italian , cry , " he shouted and laughed loudly . The laughter echoed in the couloir , mingling with the wails . " Cry , little Italian . You came to make war . " Pere ran back to the pinnacle and gathered up his rope and tied one end to his waist . Then he returned toward the couloir and , belaying the line , leaned slowly out over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end and again leaned out , ejecting the empty shell from his rifle breach . " Where are you , little weeper ? " he yelled . The rope he could see but an overhang hid the enemy . He fired and the report crashed like the bursting of an Italian bomb ; the idiot wails cracked harshly . Round after round he sent crashing into the couloir . " Jump , little weeper , jump , " he yelled between peals of laughter . " Jump , " the huge echo repeated , between its wails . The abyss crashed and wailed and roared with glee .
