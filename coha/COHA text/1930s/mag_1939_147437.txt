The only thing Latin Americans like better than a crisis is a strong man to sit back and look to during it . They habitually refer to such a cynosure as El Hombre - The Man . Last week Latin Americans picked out El Hombre to cope with the world crisis . They wrote editorials praising his attitude , talked about him in bars , shops , homes , and , as if he were a fighting cock to be pitted one day against the ruler of the roost , began to say that in the end it would be up to El Hombre to stop the Fhrer . El Hombre 's name : Franklin Delano Roosevelt . <P> When the 21 independent countries of the Americas gathered at Lima last year to draw up an antitotalitarian pact , most of them were determined not to let El Hombre 's delegate , Cordell Hull , run the show . Argentina in particular hemmed , took exception , offered substitute phrases . The final draft , a reluctant Argentine compromise , postulated the 21 countries ' common interest , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . When war broke out fortnight ago , Argentina did a complete about-face and put herself in the forefront of the rush to implement the Lima Declaration . <P> Argentina 's Foreign Minister Dr. Jos Maria Cantilo quickly called all American diplomatic representatives in Buenos Aires for consultations . Argentinian sympathy for Germany , which was supposed to be strong , disappeared overnight . A decree curtailing the barter deals with the Nazis restored to the U. S. many of the orders for fuels , electrical appliances , chemicals , drugs , newsprint which had been coming from Europe . The War Ministry discussed discharging the German military mission which had been instructing land forces . And Argentina heartily endorsed a proposal originated by El Hombre Roosevelt but officially put forward by Panama : that the signatories of the Lima Declaration meet at Panama City late this month to work together on neutrality measures . <P> El Hombre was not altogether unconscious of the big brown eyes staring up at him . Pointedly he said for two continents to hear : " U. S. safety is , and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the seas adjacent thereto . "
