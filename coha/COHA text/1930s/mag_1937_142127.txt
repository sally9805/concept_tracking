Between Christmas and New Year , when students have gone home for their midwinter frolic , university scientists are accustomed to put down their textbooks and laboratory tools and go on a busman 's holiday . Soberly they attend dozens of conventions , read thousands of papers , talk shop , elect officers , award prizes , take stock of a year 's progress , get their names in the newspapers , mingle with a sprinkling of industrial colleagues . Last week geologists convened in Cincinnati , geographers in Syracuse , mathematicians in Durham , N. C. , philosophers in Cambridge , astronomers in Frederick , Md. ( see p. 52 ) , anthropologists in Washington , chemists in Manhattan and Princeton . As usual , the biggest and best publicized gathering was that of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , which had chosen Atlantic City for a meeting place , and where , if he wished , an ichthyologist could listen to an atom-smasher and a cosmologist to a breeder of fruit flies . <P> When British scientists get together , they like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue publicly and sometimes acrimoniously . In Atlantic City , A. A. A. S. officers and bigwigs made more theoretical and philosophical speeches than usual last week , but there was a fine display of devices to feed the traditional appetite of U. S. science for neat experiments and clever machines ( see p. 50 ) . There was a burglar alarm which fills a room with ultrashort radio waves , so that a person stepping into the room interrupts the waves and actuates the signal . There was a photoelectric meter which determines the Vitamin D content of a cod-liver oil sample by passing a light beam through it . <P> Dr. James Franklin Yeager of the Department of Agriculture projected on a screen a cardiogram from the beating heart of a cockroach . This was obtained by exposing the heart of the insect and placing on it a minute drop of wax . A human hair inserted in the wax was connected through a lever to a fine wire . The heart beats thus jerked the wire and a light beam passing across it translated them into a pulsating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardiac effect of insecticides . <P> Noteworthy discussions : <P> X-rays v. Cells . Using X-ray bombardments much more prolonged and severe than those employed in medicine , Dr. Hugo Fricke of the Long Island Biological Laboratory arrived at a theory of what happens when an X-ray photon ( unit of radiation ) is received in a living cell . The high energy carried on the photon swings the electrons of the cell up to correspondingly high energy levels which represent temperatures of 1,000,000 . This lasts for only some .00001 sec. , but large protein molecules may be broken up , carbon dioxide and hydrogen given off , and water molecules in the cell oxidized to hydrogen peroxide . The cell may then sicken and die . If it is a cell in the reproductive germ plasm , a mutation or hereditary change may occur .
