linesdeleted AT daybreak we mopped up the dew on the wings of our plane with a wad of cotton waste , and squeezed out a few spoonfuls of water foul with grease and enamel . It tasted horrible , but we drank it ; anyhow it moistened our lips . After this apology for a breakfast Prevot observed : ' It 's as well we have a revolver . ' The remark infuriated me ; I swung round on hint in a sudden passion that I immediately regretted . There was nothing I should have loathed more at that moment than a display of mawkishness . I have a habit of regarding everything as simple . Birth is simple ; growing up is simple ; to die of thirst , simplicity itself . From the corner of an eye I watched Pr6vot , ready to take a firm line , if need be , and shut him up . But Pr6vot had spoken without emotion ; he was alluding to a simple obligation of hygiene , as who should say , ' We 'd better have a wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sight of the leather holster the clay before had set me thinking , too . I had thought about it coolly , not emotionally . The ' tragic sense , ' indeed , applies only where others are involved . It was our inability to reassure those dependent on us that was tragic now ? not the re-volver , So far no planes had crossed our empty sky ; they must be searching for us in 186some other region . Probably , I decided , in Arabia . A fortnight may be needed to locate an airplane fallen in the desert when the searchers have to cover a strip of country two thousand miles from end to end , and they were probably looking for us all the way from Tripoli to Persia . Yet , frail as was this hope , we had no other , and must provide for it in our plans . Accordingly on this , the third day , I changed my tactics and set out alone across the desert . I asked Prevot to lay a fire and kindle it if visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , we had no visitors . As I started I wondered if my strength would hold out for the return journey . I pieced together all I could recall about the Libyan Desert . In the Sahara the humidity in the air is 40 per cent ; here it drops to 18 per cent , and life goes up in vapor . Bedouins , travelers , and colonial officers tell us that a man can survive for nineteen hours without drinking , When in the twentieth hour his eyes begin to flood with light , the end comes swiftly . Dying of thirst is a rapid process . To the northeast wind , abnormal in these parts , the very wind which had falsified my reckoning and marooned us on the plateau , we obviously owed the prolongation of our lives . How long a reprieve would it accord us before our eyes began to glaze with light ? I felt as if I were setting out to cross the Atlantic in a canoe . Yet , somehow , in the dawn light our surroundings seemed less lugu-brious . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , like a gypsy taking the road again . On the previous evening we had laid snares across the mouths of some mysterious burrows , and my poaching instincts were on the alert . I began by examining these traps ; all were empty . So I was not to have a drink of blood ? in point of fact I 'd hardly expected it . But , if little disappointed , I was de-cidedly puzzled . How did these crea-tures manage to survive in the desert ? Presumably they were fennecs , little fox-like carnivores with enormous ears . I could not resist an impulse to follow up the tracks of one of them . They led me to a narrow river of sand in which every footprint was plainly inscribed . They were graceful little footprints , each with the three toes splayed out fanwise . I pictured my small friend loping along in the half-light , licking the dewy stones . Presently the footprints were wider apart ; here my fennec had put on speed . And here a friend had joined him ; they had trotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this reconstruction of their morning stroll ? how fascinating were these tiny vestiges of Het ? and I forgot that I was thirsty . At last I reached their feeding ground . Every hundred yards or so a small dry shrub stood up from the level sand ; the branches were festooned with little yel-low snails . Here the fennec had come for his early morning marketing . And now a curious mystery of nature held my attention . My fennec had not paused at all the shrubs ; some , though they were thick with snails , he had disdained . Others he had skirted with obvious cir-cumspection . Others , again , he had ap-proached , but had not stripped them . After eating two or three snails he had moved on to another hostelry . Was it to enable the snails to reproduce themselves , I wondered , that he took such pains not to exhaust the stock on any single shrub , indeed on any bough ? Or was it a sort of game for him , not to glut himself at once , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally the spoor led me to the animal 's burrow . I pictured him pricking up his ears , startled by the rumble of my footsteps overhead . And I addressed a valediction to my unseen friend . ' Mon petit , my number 's up , I know ; but , queerly enough , that has n't damped my interest in your little ways ! ' And , as I stood there musing , it struck me that one adapts oneself to everything . No man lets the thought that thirty years hence he will probably be dead impair his present zest for life . Thirty years , or three days ? it 's all a matter of perspective . . . . Still , certain vistas of the imagination are best ignored . When I set out again I felt that , as my strength declined , a subtle change was coming over me . Now , if there were no mirages , I invented them . ' Coo-ce ! ' I beckoned wildly , but that man whom I had just seen waving his arms to me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life . The sleeping Bedouin whom I tried to rouse changed suddenly into a coal-black log . But what on earth was a tree trunk doing here ? Bending down , I tried to lift a broken branch . It was in solid marble . I drew myself up and looked around me ; marble logs lay everywhere ? the soil was littered with the wreckage of a prehistoric forest . Myriads of years ago it had been devastated by some primeval hurricane ; countless centuries had rolled up to my feet these petrified logs , massive as the shattered pillars of a vast cathedral , jet-black and polished smooth as steel . Each knot in the branches , every torsion of the living stem , stood out , and I could count the rings along the trunks . Once this forest had been loud with birds and rustling leaves ; then the doom linesdeleted widened since you crossed the ridge ! And there ? the loveliest of cities ! ' You know quite well it 's only a mirage . ' Of course I do . D ' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hunting down a mirage , what 's to prevent me ? Why should n't I indulge in hope ? Suppose I 've taken a liking to that fine old city with its crenelated walls beflagged in sunbeams ? Suppose it pleases me to put my best foot foremost and walk ahead , now I 've got over my fatigue and feel in form again ? Old PrOvot and his revolver ? what damned nonsense ! Much better to be tight , as I am now . Dead drunk  --  and dying of thirst ! ' The twilight sobered me down . Suddenly I halted , appalled to realize how far I was from our base . Mirage dies with the nightfall . Horizons are stripped of their pomps and palaces , their priestly vestments , and the desert comes into its own again . ' A lot of good it 'll do you ! You 'll only get benighted on the way , and have to wait for daylight . And by then your footprints will have been effaced and you 'll be . . . nowhere . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's the good of turning back yet once again ? Why , it 's unthinkable , turning tail just here and now ? just when very likely I 'm within arm 's length of the sea . ' The sea ! Whereabouts is that sea of yours ? Anyhow you could n't walk that distance . And do n't forget that PrOvot ' s looking out for you by the Simon . Quite likely he 's been spotted by a caravan . ' Yes , I decided , it was wiser to return ; but first , on the off chance , I 'd try a call for help . ' Coo-ee ! ' No answer ? and I 'd always thought our planet was inhabited ! Coo-ee ! Anyone there ? ' The last word was a croak ? my voice was gone . Still I tried one snore Coo-eer before turning on my tracks . After two hours ' tramp I saw a glow on the horizon ; panic-stricken at the idea I might have lost my way , PrOvot had launched a signal on the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another hour 's walk ; five hundred yards to go , then fifty . What ? ' I halted in sheer stupefaction . Joy surged up in my heart , irresistibly , triumphantly . There , in the firelight , PrOvot was chatting with two Arabs , who were leaning against the engine . Engrossed in his delight , he had not seen me yet . If I 'd had the sense to stay behind with him , I 'd have been saved al-ready ! Ahoy ! ' I cried exultantly . The nomads gave a start and stared in my direction . Turning his back on them , PrOvot hastened towards inc . I flung my arms out wide . Pr6vot caught me by the elbow and steadied me ? was I totter-ing ? So they 've come ? ' Eh ? ' The Arabs ? ' What Arabs ? ' Those two chaps over there , damn it ! The ones you were talking to . ' PrOvot eyed me strangely ; when he spoke I had the impression he was imparting to me , reluctantly , a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it seemed no use fighting back my tears . . . II All we had had to drinlc . for twenty-four hours ? since the last sundown ? was a spoonful of dew water gleaned at daybreak from the wreckage . Happily for us a northeast wind had prevailed throughout the day , and retarded to some extent the evaporation front our bodies . As usual when a northeaster blows across the desert , a towering mass of clouds had banked up on the horizon . Fervently we longed for them to drift towards us , and break in rain . But in this desert rain is never known to fall . ' I 've an idea , Priwot ! How about dismantling one of the parachutes and clamping the pieces clown with stones ? If the wind does n't turn they 'll be soaked with dew by sunrise and we can wring the water out into one of the tanks . ' Accordingly we spread out under the stars the six triangles of white cloth that compose a parachute , and Pr6vot took clown a tank . Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , however , we had had a stroke of luck . Pr6vot had unearthed an orange amongst the abris . We shared it between us . I felt like crying for joy ? yet what was half an orange when what we needed was several gallons of water each ? Lying beside our campfire , feasting my eyes upon the glowing rind , I murmured half aloud : ' An orange ? nobody on earth has an idea of what it really is ! ' And then : Again to-night the certainty we 're clone for does n't spoil my pleasure in the least . Rarely have I enjoyed anything so much as the piece of orange that I 'm squeezing , ' I rolled over on to my back and , while I sucked the fruit , counted the shooting stars . For a moment I felt preposterously happy . No one , ' I thought , ' has any inkling of the world of men , the scheme of human things , until he 's plunged into the thick of it . ' For the first time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed a cigarette and a tot of rum on his way to the gallows . Hitherto I had pictured him waving away , disgusted , this last indignity . Now I knew better ; he thoroughly enjoys it . When he smiles we think him a stout-hearted ruffian , when , in reality , he is relishing his rum ! We fail to realize he sees things in a new perspective , and of his last ten minutes makes a lifetime .. . At dawn we found we had collected a large supply of water , almost two quarts . So the long agony of thirst was ended ; we could drink our fill ; we were saved . From the tank I ladled up a draft in a tin mug ; the water was tinged a brilliant yellow-green , and at my first gulp 1 found its flavor so appalling that , thirsty as I was , I could not bring myself to swallow it . If need be I might put up with liquid mud , but that acrid , metallic taste turned my stomach . I glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes fixed on the ground , us if he were hunting for something . Suddenly he bent forward and vomited , without ceasing to walk in a circle . Thirty seconds later I followed suit , retching so violently that I fell forward on my knees , digging my fingers into the sand . Neither of us said a word . For a quarter of an hour we stayed thus , our bodies racked with spasms of vomiting , bringing up only a little bile . At lust it was over ; all I now felt was it faint , evanescent nausea . But our last hope was gone . ( I never found out if this mischance was due to the coating of the parachute or to some chemical deposit in the tank . ) It was high time to make a move . The clay was breaking . En route ' Now we would turn our backs on this accursed plateau and walk straight ahead across the desert till we dropped . Since the previous day I had been turning over in my mind Guillaume 's experience in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobey the airman 's golden rule ? that he must stand by his fallen plane ; no one would conic to look for us here . Once more we realized that we were not the shipwrecked party ; victims of a wreck were , rather , those who were awaiting us . It was they to whom our silence was a menace . Already , perhaps , they were blundering in a maze of errors ; it was for us to make our way to them , to set them right . Just so Guillaume , when he came back from the Andes , had said to me : ' They were lost ; I found my way to them . ' That was the truth of it ? a universal truth . ' If I were left to myself , ' PrOvot remarked , I 'd just lie down and sleep . ' ' En route ! ' We set out , side by side , on the day 's march , heading east-northeast . If we had crossed the Nile it meant that with every step we were plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory is a blank . All I can recall is an impression of desperate hurry ? of hastening towards no goal , to an inevitable breakdown . I kept my eyes fixed on the ground ; the mirages were more than I could bear . Now and again we corrected our course by compass ; now and again , lying on the sand , we took a breather . Somewhere I flung away the cape I had brought with me for the night . All the rest of that day has faded from my memory ; it was as if I , too , had turned to sand , my thoughts to dust . Only with the twilight , the first cool hour , did my memory return . At nightfall we decided to ? halt . I knew we should have done better to push on ; another waterless night would be the end of us . However , we had brought with us the strips of parachute cloth ; if the poison did not come from the chemicals with which they had been dressed , we could reckon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dew traps under the stars . But that night the north was cloudless ; the wind had veered , and changed its savor . It was as if the desert had wakened to our presence and stalked us down . Now we were in its clutches ; I could feel its rough tongue licking my hands and cheeks , could smell its fetid breath . Yet , if I set out on the march again , I should not last six miles . In three days I had covered a hundred miles , with practically nothing to drink . Just as we halted , I heard Prevot 's voice . ' That 's a lake over there , I 'll stake my soul on it . ' ' You 're raving . ' ' Do n't forget it 's sunset . There ca n't be any mirages at this hour . ' I did not reply . I had long since given up believing my eyes . Perhaps it was not a mirage ; only a hallucination , a figment of delirious fancy . How could Prevot still believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , I 'm going to have a look , anyhow . It 's not twenty minutes walk away . ' His obstinacy got on my nerves . ' Have it your own way . Take the air a bit ; it 's excellent for the health . But if ' that lake of yours exists , it 's salty ? that 's a certainty . And , salty or not , it 's an invention of the devil . Not to mention that there is n't any lake ! ' Prevot was up and moving , his eyes fixed in a glassy stare , before I had finished speaking . These imperious obsessions were nothing new to me . Had n't I read of somnambulists flinging themselves under the wheels of locomotives ? I knew Pr6vot would never return . The void around him would go to his head , he would be seized by a sort of vertigo and find himself unable to turn back . A few steps farther and he would collapse , to die out there in his tracks ... as hero I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ? It struck me that this feeling of indifference was a bad sign . Once before , submerged and almost drowned in the cabin of my plane , I had felt that unnatural placidity . I took advantage of it to write a ' farewell letter , ' lying face downward on the pebbles . How far gone was I , I wondered . I tried to summon up some saliva on my palate , ? how long was it since I last spat ? ? but none would come . I had no spittle left . When I closed my mouth some gluey substance sealed my lips , forming , as it dried , a solid crust upon them . However , I still could swallow , and as yet no flashes of light had developed in my eyes . Once I was treated to that spectacular display , the end , I knew , would lie an hour or two ahead . Night came , lit by a moon perceptibly enlarged since I last saw it rise . Prevot showed no sign of returning . Stretched on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind . A memory , a dim impression , was hovering in the background of my thoughts ; I tried to give it form . I. was . . . where was I ? I was at sea . Yes , on a ship bound for South America . I was lying on the deck , watching a masthead swinging slowly to and fro across the stars . Here there was no mast , but I was outward bound again ? to a bourne not of my choosing . Fate had manacled my hands and feet and thrown me down on the deck , My thoughts drifted back to Prevot , my lost companion . A fine fellow , Prevot . Never once had I heard him whimper . I could n't have endured it had he done so . Yes , Prevot was a man . . . . What ? What was that. ? There he was five hundred yards away , swinging his lamp . He must have lost the trail . I had no lamp with which to signal back , so I stood up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another lamp flashed out two hundred yards from his ; then a third lamp . So that was it ? a search party ! ' Coo-eel ' I shouted . Still they seemed not to hear . The three lamps went on signaling towards me . ' I 'm sane , ' I murmured . ' I 've all my wits about me . There 's nothing wrong with my sight . And there I see three lamps , five hundred yards away . ' Coo-ce ! ' Still no one heard . A gust of panic swept over me ? that was the only time I felt it . ' Thank goodness , I still could use my legs , could run . ' Damn it ! Wait ! I 'm coming ! ' They seemed to be turning away , going to look elsewhere . And I felt myself tottering , falling on the very threshold of escape , when friendly arms were stretching out towards me . ' Coo-eel Coo-ee ! ' An answering call ? at last ! My breath caught in my throat , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I stumbled forward , fell . ' When I saw all those lights I could n't help . . ' What lights ? ' Then I saw ? he was alone . And now I felt no despair , only a rankling sense of outrage . ' Well , how about that lake of yours ? ' asked sarcastically . ' It kept moving farther away as I went on . I followed it up for half an hour , but it was n't any use . So I turned back . Anyhow , I 'm positive it was a lake . ' ' You ' re mad ? stark , staring mad ! Why did you do that ? Tell me ? why ? ' What had he done ? Why had he done it ? I could have wept with rage ? but I had no notion why I was indignant . Prevot stammered out an explanation . ' I hoped to find some water , for you to drink . Your lips have gone so white ... So that was it . My anger fell . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were waking from sleep . I felt dejected . Now it was my turn to explain . ' I saw those lights as clearly as I see you , ' I said in a low voice . ' There were three lamps . I 'll swear I saw them . ' Prevot sat silent for a moment ; then , ' Yes , ' he said at last , ' we 're in a damned bad way . ' III In the vaporless air the radiation from the soil was rapid , and already the night was turning cold . I got up and began to walk about . I had not gone far when a violent trembling fit pulled me up . Deprived of its water ration , my blood was circulating sluggishly , and an icy chill , due not only to the coldness of the air , was numbing my body . My teeth began to chatter , my limbs to twitch convulsively . My fingers were shaking so much that I could not switch on my electric torch . I have never been worried by low temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death and that , oddly enough , as the effect of thirst ! Tired of carrying my cape in the heat , I had dropped it somewhere on the way . A bitter wind was rising , and I made the discovery that there is no shelter in the desert . Smooth as a marble pavement , by day it holds no shadows , by night it turns you over , naked , to the wind . There is no hedgerow , no tree , no rock behind which to take cover . Like a cavalry charge across open country the wind bore down on me . Vainly I twisted and turned to avoid it ; lay down and stood up again . Lying or standing , I could feel it jabbing my limbs with ice-tipped lances . There was no escaping its fierce onslaught ; my limbs gave way under me , and falling on my knees , my head between my hands , I waited for the death stroke . Some time later I realized what had happened ; I had struggled to my feet and , shivering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I ? Then I heard Prevot 's voice ; his shouts must have aroused me . I went back to him , still trembling from head to foot , my whole body convulsed by a sort of hiccup . ' It is n't only the cold , ' I murmured . ' It 's something more . It 's the end . All the water 's been drained out of me ; I overdid it yesterday and the day before when I went off on my own . ' I loathed the thought of dying of cold ; far preferable had been those phantasms of my mind : the trees , the lights , the cross . Indeed , I had been beginning to find them rather fascinating . But to be whipped to death like a slave revolted me . I sank once more on to my knees . We had brought along some of our medicines ; a hundred grammes of ether , a hundred of ninety-degree alcohol , and a bottle of iodine . I tried some sips of pure ether ; it was like swallowing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it closed my gullet . I dug a trench , lay down in it , and blanketed myself with sand . Only my face emerged . Prevot had collected some twigs and lit a fire , but there was little warmth in it . He declined to bury him-self as I had done , thinking it better to keep on the move . He was wrong . My throat stayed shut ? a bad sign , that . Still I was feeling better now ; and preposterously calm , calm with a peace that passed my understanding . I was being carried overseas , lashed to the deck of a slave ship , under the stars . Y somehow I felt little or no distress . The cold no longer troubled me , provided I did not stir a muscle . My body was asleep under the sand ; I forgot its existence . I resolved to keep quite motionless ; thus I should have no more pain . Really in such is death one suffers very little ; exhaustion and delirium weave their fantasies upon the pain 's insistence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quaint and rather cruel fairy tale . A little while ago the wind was after me ; now , to escape it , I turned in circles like a frightened animal . Then I had found it hard to breathe , as if a knee were planted on my chest . I had wrestled with the angel and he had downed me . Never , so far , had the desert left me to myself . But , now I had said good-bye to the world around me , I could withdraw into myself ; my eyelashes had stopped fluttering , my eyes were shut . Now I could set my mind adrift upon a stream of fancies sweeping me away towards a quiet ecstasy , as every torrent comes to rest at last in the abysmal slumber of the sea . I bade farewell to eyes that I was never to see again under their golden aureole . Was it my fault if the human body can not survive three days of drouth ? Never had I dreamed myself so tributary to the water springs ; I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rope . He always thinks that he can ' forge ahead , ' that he is master of his fate . He can not see the rope that tethers him to the well ; that , like a navel cord , links him with the belly of the earth . One step beyond it , and he dies . ' Physical suffering apart , ' I mused , deleted material stone ; a heart that scorns the grace of tears . ' I pushed aside my coverlet of sand and stood up . ' Let 's mako a start , Prevot . Our throats are open still , and we 'd best keep moving while we can . ' IV A west wind , the wind that desiccates a man in nineteen hours , was blowing . My throat was not quite closed as yet , but it was getting hard and painful , and felt as if a rasp were lodged insido it . Before long , no doubt , the dry cough I had heard described would start ; I was on the watch for it . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst symptom of all  --  motes of light were dancing in my eyes ; once they changed to flames , there would be nothing for it but to lie down . We set off at a quick pace , to make the most of the cool early hours . Only too well we knew that when the sun was high we should walk no more . We had no right to sweat ; no right even to a breather . For all the coolness of the air , there was only 18 per cent humidity in it ; the wind that fanned us had come across the desert , and under its soft , insidious caress our veins were gradually running dry . On the first day we had eaten a few grapes ; during the last three days half an orange each and half a spongecake . Now , even if food had been forthcoming , we could not have masticated it ; we had no saliva left . Still I was not hungry in the least ; all I felt was thirst . And , from now on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the hardening of my throat , a tongue that felt like plaster of Paris , a rasping in the gullet , a foul taste in the mouth . These sensations were wholly novel to me ; presumably water would have alleviated them , but I had no memories associating water with their relief . Thirst was becotning more and more a malady , less and less a craving . When I conjured up a mental picture of fruits and flowing streams I found that their appeal was losing poignancy ; everything , indeed , was growing dim , even the lustre of that heaven-sent orange , of those dark , haunting eyes under the wide sun hat . I was already halfway to complete oblivion . We had given up walking long distances without a pause . After a stretch of five hundred yards our legs gave way beneath us . What a relief it was to lie down for a few minutes ! But always something urged us on and on . After a while the landscape changed . The pebbles grew less abundant , giving place to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of dunes , dotted with low shrubs , closed the horizon . Anyhow the sand was preferable to the black , metallic crust of pebbles over which we had been toiling . The reaches of pale yellow sand had a familiar look ; I fancied myself back in the Sahara . Now we broke down every two hundred yards . ' Let 's carry on anyhow , ' I whispered , ' as far as those bushes over there . ' We were at the end of our tether . When , a week later , in a car , we retraced our tracks on our way back to the &-; moon , I found that this , our last lap , totaled forty-eight miles . So , all told , I had walked a hundred and twenty miles ? what wonder if my legs would carry me no farther ? Yesterday , ' I mused , ' I abandoned hope ; to-day the very word is meaningless . We are walking blindly , mechanically on , like oxen harnessed to a plough . Yesterday I dreamed of paradisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do not believe in oranges . . . When I took stock of my feelings it seemed as if my heart had dried up , like my throat . I was on the verge of collapse , yet I felt no despair , not even much distress . So much the worse , ' I reflected ; ' grief would have been refreshing as a draft of water . There is comfort in self-pity ; it is like a friendly consola- don . But now I have no friend left on earth . When our bodies are found , our eyes burnt out , they will imagine we have cried despairingly for help , have suffered horribly . But emotions , regret , the solaces of grief ? all these are luxuries ; and we have clone with luxury . When first love dies , a young girl learns the meaning of sorrow , and finds relief in tears . Grief is implicit in the vibrant heart of life . But I have no grief left . ' Suddenly . . . what was it I had seen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope swept over me . Instinct had lit on something before my consciousness had taken its meaning . Nothing had changed ? yet everything was different . Now the waste of sand , the knolls and tufts of brushwood , were suddenly transformed from a mere landscape into a stage setting . True , as yet the stage was empty , but everything was set in readiness . I stared at Pr6vot . He seemed to share my stupefaction , and to be equally unable to clear up his impressions . At that moment I could have sworn that something was about to happen . I could have sworn the desert had come to life ; the silence of the sand was charged with rushing sounds , loud with the cheerful bustle of a country fair . We were saved . I had seen footprints in the sand . Like derelicts of a world-wide migration , we had been abandoned in the wilderness ; outcast from the tribe of men , we had lost all traces of our kind . Now suddenly the ban was lifted . We had found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprint of a human foot . Here , Pr6vot , two men parted company . ' And here a camel knelt down . ' And just here .. Still , we were not saved yet . We could not afford to dawdle . In an hour or two we should be past rescuing . Once the thirst cough ' sets in , death gives a manshort shrift . And just now our throats were in a bad way . Yet I did not lose heart . Somewhere near by I knew a caravan was floundering through the sands , laden with all the riches of the earth . We forced ourselves ahead ? then suddenly I heard a cock crow . What was it Guillaume told me ? Towards the end I heard cocks crowing and railway trains passing in the distance . ' The words flashed into my mind at the precise moment I heard the cockcrow . First of all , ' I thought , ' my eyes played me false . Now , I suppose , my thirst is playing tricks on me . Still , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Pr6vot gripped my arm . ' Hear that ? ' he asked . What ? ' A cock . ' Why , then .. Then ? there was no disputing it ? we were saved ! I had one last hallucination ? of three dogs running after each other . PrOvot , looking in the same direction , saw nothing . But both of us together beckoned to a Bedouin who suddenly appeared ; both of us racked our throats shouting to him . And both of us burst out laughing with delight . Mit our voices did not carry fifty y , trds . The Bedouin who had just loomed up beyond a hillock moved slowly out of sight with his camel . ' Perhaps , ' I thought , ' the man is alone ; some evil genius has shown him for a moment only to tantalize us . ' And we had no strength left for running after him . Another Arab showed up in profile on the dune . We shouted to hint , but our voices failed again . Then we began to wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Bedouin persisted in looking away , to his right . At last , with an agonizing slowness , he swung round . ' Once his eyes meet ours , ' I thought , ' it is the grand finale ; on the instant that he sights us , he will banish mirage and thirst and death . See ! He is beginning to turn in our direction , and already the whole world is changed ! With a casual movement of his body , by a mere deviation of his eyes , godlike he is creating life . ' The miracle had come to pass ! He was walking towards us across the sands , as a god walks the waves . You , our rescuer , will dwell forever in my memory , yet never shall I be able to recall your features . You stand for Man ; I see in you incarnate the lineaments of all mankind . Our paths had never crossed before , and yet at once you knew us . We were your kin , and you a well-beloved brother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw you then , as still I see you , invested with all nobility and loving-kindness . All my friends , all my foes , personified in you , were coming towards me . And it seemed to me that you were bringing , not deliverance , but forgiveness . Water lay in your gift ; yours was the surest patent of nobility . And I felt I had no enemy left in all the world . Beyond the pale of race and language we understood each other . The Arab merely glanced at us . Then , laying his hands on our shoulders , he pressed on them . Yielding to the pressure , we sank down on the sand . At that moment racial distinctions , difference of language , were of no account . All that counted was the poor nomad of the desert , laying angelic hands upon our shoulders . For a while we waited , our foreheads pillowed on the sand . At last the man came to us with a basin of water and , lying on our bellies , we plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool . Our eagerness alarmed the Bedouin , who forced us to stop drinking from time to time . The moment he released us we plunged our lips again into the water . As I drank , my mind was ringing with a wean of water , the element that , more than a necessity of life , is life itself . Tasteless , colorless , scentless , it eludes description ; we relish it unwittingly . It thrills us with a joy far subtler than any satisfaction of the senses . With the first draft of water , feelings we have prized and lost are given back to us ; by its grace the dried-up wellsprings of emotion flow again . Of all things hidden in the womb of earth , water is the purest ; nothing in the world is so precious ? and nothing so precarious . A man may die of thirst beside a mineral spring , or within arm 's length of a salt lake ; and he may die despite a gallon of dew when it holds certain chemicals in solution . For water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet how infinitely simple is the joy pervading us when we quench our thirst ! That is the end of my tale . The Bedouins conveyed to us as best they could that there were Europeans in the neighborhood . Mounted on a camel 's back , we set out to join them , but after three hours ' jolting we had had enough of it . We persuaded our rescuers to leave us in a camp while the camelcers went ahead to fetch help . Towards six in the evening a car manned by armed Bedouins picked us up . Half an hour later we alighted at the bungalow of M. Raccaud , a Swiss engineer who manages a soda factory far out in the desert , near a saltern . By midnight I was in Cairo . . . . I awoke to find myself between white sheets , with the sun , an enemy no longer , stealing past the curtains . I buttered a roll and spooned honey on to it. ; I found it tasted exactly like the rolls and honey of my boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish sense of living in a perpetual wonderland had returned to me . My eyes strayed back to the telegram lying on the counterpane ; three common French words , yet , coming from those dearest of all to toe , most wonderful of messages : Semmes tenement henreux ..
