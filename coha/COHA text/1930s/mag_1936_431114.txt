 | The Conquest o f Pain By Henry Morton Robinson Pain , in rare cases , can be a spiritual stimulant and the loftiest of philosophic instructors , but for most of us it is a cruelly nagging intimation of our mortality . Yet pain has its uses : it is a danger signal warning us that something is amiss , and it aids the physician in diagnosing the nature and intensity of our malady . To relieve pain has always been a major objective of medicine , and even where a cure is impossible , the art of the physician extends itself to diminish suffering . Indeed many of the most important recent developments in medicine and surgery are directed toward the obliteration of pains formerly considered part of our human fate . Trifacial neuralgia , for example , has been described as the most exquisite pain that can afflict mankind . It attacks the face and head in such sudden and terrific paroxysms that it was formerly known as " tic douloureux " or the dolorous spasm . This disease had a patron saint and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days sufferers from the " tic douloureux " could only pray for a speedy recovery or a merciful death . Recently , however , surgery has stepped to their rescue ; the three roots of the sensory nerve supplying the face are now removed by a delicate operation . The motor nerves controlling facial expression are left untouched , for if these were severed facial paralysis would result . This operation puts a dramatic end to tri-facial neuralgia . Sciatic neuritis is an inflammation of the extremely sensitive sciatic nerve , located in the hip ; it torments its victims with an intractable pain that formerly could be deadened only by the constant use of morphine . But this pain can now be controlled by the injection of pure ethyl alcohol into the outer covering of the spinal canal . Known as the " alcohol block , " it affords grateful relief for as long as two weeks at a time . During these painfree periods corrective exercises and muscle building can be undertaken in many cases , thus permanently overcoming the causes of the disease itself . In cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been either an agonizing ordeal for the patient and his family or a massively drugged descent into the final coma . Medical science is powerless to check the course of the disease at this stage , but it can bring relief by means of neuro surgery . A comparatively simple op-@#  | eration severs the sensory roots in the spine supplying sensation to the affected parts ; by cutting these nerves no communication of pain is permitted to reach the brain . When it is impossible to relieve pain by severing connective nerves , as in malignant tumors of the spinal cord , an operation known as a " chordotomy " is performed . In this drastic operation the spinal cord itself is cut ; partial paralysis is the willing fee the patient pays for the easement of his suffering . Heart disease , which accounts for more deaths than any two other causes combined , is frequently accompanied by excruciating pain ; angina pectoris , a spasm of the coronary arteries of the heart , is a clamping agony that grips the sufferer with a sense of impending death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discovered . Dr. John C. Krantz of the University of Michigan found that the paroxysms may be almost instantaneously alleviated by snuffing a crystalline substance called trichlorethylene . In advanced cases of heart disease , when the patient may be in constant pain , and all drugs are valueless , surgery removes the entire thyroid , the " whip of the heart , " and thus brings marked relief to the sufferer . Neither the crystalline drug nor the surgical operation is a cure for the underlying disorder , but both are notably successful in relieving a heart condition that makes life intolerable . Arthritis , one of the chief " disabling diseases " in the United States , attacks the joints and renders all movement either impossible or extremely painful . A common cause of arthritis is gonorrhea ; In gonorrheal arthritis the knee , shoulder , wrist and ankle become terribly swollen and inflamed . This pain is acute , prolonged and accompanied by high fever . Doctors noticed that patients with the highest fever recovered in the shortest time , because the gonococci found it difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now try to raise the body heat , either by injections of typhoid vaccine , or by radiothermy . The body temperature is lifted to 105 to 108 degrees F. by " short wave " therapy . The pain disappears with a single treatment , and after a week of radiothermy the patient permanently recovers full use of his limbs . To be successful , however , this treatment must be instituted before any actual bone changes occur . When such changes have occurred , surgery removes the remnants of the destroyed cartilage that forms the " gliding surface " of the joint ; this operation permits the bony surfaces to grow together , thus giving a stiff but painfree joint which may serve the sufferer better than a joint which  | is only partially flexible and highly painful . The unbearable pain of Buerger 's disease is due to the gradual plugging of the smaller blood vessels in the legs . This malady is now being successfully relieved by infusions of sodium chloride ; in certain cases this salt solution works wonders . Patients who could not walk a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six infusions , go about the normal business of living . These infusions encourage a helpful circulation in the affected area , but unfortunately are not a complete cure for the underlying disease . Lobar pneumonia , a treacherous disease with a high mortality , is accompanied by severe chest pains caused , in breathing , by friction between the two layers of the inflamed pleura . These pains , which are merely dulled by the use of morphine , can be treated by the introduction of air under careful pressure between the two layers of the pleura . The air partially collapses the lung and separates the inflamed walls of the pleura so that respiration does not chafe them together with consequent pain . The obstruction of the urethra known to the ancients as the " fit of the stone " has been since the time of Hippocrates one of the most dreaded visitations of pain ; the sufferer either expired in his agony or submitted to a clumsy operation . Today the unattended passing of a kidney stone is as painful as ever , but the urologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cystoscope , an instrument that is introduced through the urethra and illuminates the interior of the bladder , urologists effect the removal of kidney stones by a bloodless technique , thus sparing the patient untold pain , as well as the risk and expense of an open operation . The workman who stands on his feet all day , and the expectant mother who receives poor prenatal care , both know the torment of varicose veins ; these are the two classes most affected by this common malady which causes intense cramps and swelling in the legs . Bandaging , surgical removal and cautery of the veins were never successful ; in introducing the new " injection therapy , " doctors proceed along this line of reasoning : A varicose vein is one that has lost its function ; its walls have sagged hopelessly , and the resulting pools of venous blood are the cause of the pain . Thus it becomes necessary to obliterate the incompetent vein and permit other healthy veins to perform its work . This is done by injecting drying solutions which form immovable clots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nearby veins . When , due to syphilis or other  | diseases , the walls of a large artery become dilated at a weakened spot , an aneurysm results ; its balloonlike mass threatens an imminent " blowout " with consequent death . Excruciating pain is caused by the growing aneurysm which pushes before it all the body structures ; its constant pulsations will wear away any bone in the body . For the relief of this condition modern surgery has devised a " short circuiting " operation , whereby contributory arteries are severed and then sewn together in such a way as to reduce the pressure in the aneurysm . This operation may be roughly compared to the practice of engineers who , when they wish to reduce a river 's volume at a certain point , cut by-pass canals to " detour " the surplus water . Dr. Wayne Babcock of Philadelphia has pioneered in this type of surgery , and the operating technique bears his name . The horrors of minor surgery are long remembered by anyone who has ever had a boil lanced or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the accompaniment of charnel house screams , because general anesthesia was considered impractical , and anyway the patient could " take it . " Today , however , these barbaric agonies are avoided by a varied array of local anesthetics . Most widely used perhaps is ethyl chloride sprayed over the affected area with a gun , thus " freezing " the nerve endings that transmit sensations of pain to the brain . Amytal and other barbiturate derivatives are given orally ; these induce a short sleep and effectually deaden pain . For operative procedures that may last as long as 20 minutes , a compound known as evipaI is injected into the blood stream . Thirty seconds after the injection the patient lapses into unconsciousness with complete muscular relaxation . The effect lasts from a quarter to half an hour , and the patient gradually returns to normal with no nausea , excitement or unpleasant memories . Avertin , given rectally as an enema , is particularly serviceable in operations involving the thyroid , face or eye , since it obviates the clutter of the ether mask around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations of the respiratory tract , such as lung surgery , that prohibit the use of ether , and in handling patients who dread anesthesia . Such patients think they are merely receiving an enema and wake up to find their operation a thing of history . Our catalogue of mortal pain might include all degrees of human suffering , from the throbbing of an inflamed fingernail to the last tortured flutterings of an arteriosclerotic heart . We should then be obliged to list the cunning analgesics and therapies that  | medicine has mercifully provided : soothing tannic-acid jellies for the treatment of third-degree burns ; injections of adrenalin for the relief of urticaria ; of atropin for the relaxation of spasm in renal colic . We should then describe the action of those two new mercury compounds , salyrgan and mercupurin , that mobilize the superfluous body fluids in congestive heart disease , excrete them via the kidneys , and thus bring relief to the flagging heart . That familiar bugbear , the dentist 's drill , has lost much of its terror since Dr. Leroy Hartman of Columbia University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filling of tooth cavities , and extended it to humanity as a gift . Turning to the marvelous devices of bloodless surgery , we should glance at the bronchoscope , the illuminated tube by which buttons , tacks , false teeth and peanut shells are removed from gasping lungs . And at least passing mention should be made of the " nerve block " treatment of migraine , that hitherto invincible headache ; or of the grateful " novocaine pack " which hushes the clamor of jagged wounds while they are being cleansed . But sometimes , despite all medical skill , pain leads on to death . And what of this horror of death ? Is the very end something to fear ? According to the many doctors and nurses to whom I have put this question , it is not . As a person approaches death , all apprehension disappears , even though he has lived in constant fear of death . A serene gratitude overtakes the sufferer as he realizes that the last few steps of his journey hold no terrors . As death nears , nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due sometimes to a merciful provision of nature ; sometimes to sedatives humanely administered . In any case , be it an everyday matter of minor surgery or a grim struggle with death , medical science is resolved that humanity must not suffer unnecessarily .
