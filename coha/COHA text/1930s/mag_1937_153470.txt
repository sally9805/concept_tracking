Nearly two months before the chestnut trees would bloom in the Bois , spring had come to Paris , the official openings of the great fashion houses had just ended and last week the Buyers were returning to the U. S. with notebooks full of orders , suitcases full of models . <P> Because the business of designing women 's clothes is a major French industry employing thousands of people , the opening of a spring collection at an important house is as hard to get into as the Royal Enclosure at Ascot . Tickets are most carefully issued , ticket-holders must be recognized , detectives snoop about behind the rather shoddy French chairs in the showrooms , ready to pounce on cameras or sketch pads , weapons of the style pirates . Two other facts are important : 1 ) Though the Rue de la Paix is firmly connected in the public mind with fashion houses , hardly any of the important establishments remain on that brief street ; 2 ) Many of the top-flight French designers are not French . <P> Looking over their notebooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly ten years the most important designer in Paris remains Elsa Schiaparelli , Italian-born daughter of a onetime Dean of the University of Rome and long-time resident in New York 's Greenwich Village .

Though Designer Molyneux looks , talks and acts like a dressmaker , he fought straight through the World War , was wounded three times , wears the purple- &-white; ribbon of the Military Cross won for gallantry in action . British too and important to any fashion scout is Designer Norman Hartnell , whose sweeping formal evening gowns are highly favored by long-limbed British peeresses . Despite his name , Designer Mainbocher was born in Chicago , worked for a long time as pianist for Night Club Singer Cobina Wright , later as an associate editor of Vogue 's Paris edition . <P> Though he has as yet no Paris salon , Designer Rudolf Lanz of Salzburg has had such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important Paris houses are experimenting this spring with adaptations of the traditional Lanz Dirndl ( tight-bodiced peasant dress ) for street wear . <P> Notes from the 1937 openings : <P> Stripes are definitely in vogue , disastrous though they may be for ample figures . <P> For day dresses , designers are concentrating attention on the skirts . Some are slashed , some elaborately embroidered , some appliqud with flowers , paillettes , fur .
