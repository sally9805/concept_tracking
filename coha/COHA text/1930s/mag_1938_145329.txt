Bronzed , able-bodied Clark Wyly , 28 , has as much claim as anyone to the title of " typical U. S. seaman . " Texas-born , he . took to the Navy as soon as the law allowed . After a six-year hitch he signed as an able seaman on the Panama Pacific liner California . This fall the California and her sisterships Virginia and Pennsylvania became the Uruguay , Brazil and Argentina of the Maritime Commission 's Good Neighbor Fleet ( American Republics Line ) . At Rio de Janeiro on November 4 , on the Uruguay 's maiden voyage , a Brazilian longshoreman fell off a gangplank , caromed off a bulky wooden fender and toppled into the water . In leaped Seaman Wyly , grabbed the unconscious man , was reaching up to get a hold when the fender fell on both of them . Stunned , Wyly clung to his stevedore until rescuers hauled both men out , took the stevedore , his leg broken , to the longshoremen 's union hospital . <P> The Uruguay then sailed south for Montevideo and Buenos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Rio on November 17 to be hailed by a cheering delegation of 200 Brazilian seamen . The man they cheered for was Good Neighbor Wyly . The delegation escorted him to a flag-draped automobile , sped him to the hospital to receive the thanks of the recuperating stevedore , then took him back to his ship . There they gave him a gold medal ; a twelve-inch gold filigree model of the windjammer Saldanha da Gama , $25 in cash and an offer of a life job long shore at Rio . <P> Back in Manhattan last week Able Sea man Wyly , in the creased and scrubbed dungarees of his calling , diffidently owned up to his heroism , hastened off to bunk at the Sea men 's Y. M. C. A. until the Uruguay was ready for another Good Neighbor errand.
