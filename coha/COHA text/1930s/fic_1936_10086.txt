THE LAST PURITANtook this step on my own initiative and without your knowledge . He came , and I looked him over thoroughly . He is pale and lanky , like so many of our youths , and his whole organism seems a bit languid , although his muscles are strong enough ; but the vital organs are normal , and he is not suffering from any particular ailment whatsoever . What he lacks is spontaneity and a brisk circulation : that would of itself give him confidence and a heartier interest in whatever he may be doing . My advice , morally as well as medically , is to give him plenty of rope : he would have a good mind if he found something important to apply it to : but good minds among us , as you know , are apt to remain playful . Our dominant affairs do n't require much mind , only sharpness and diligence . Now sharpness and diligence are precisely what Peter lacks : if he is put into the business or professional mill , he will be a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him free to follow his bent ; for the moment his tastes seem to be for literature and yachting : by encouraginghim there , you may save him from listlessness and dissipation . You have a sloop laid up in Newport , I believe : why not have her put in commission , with a reliable skipper , and let Peter have her to sail in during the summer , with liberty , of course , to take a friend or two with him ? The experience would wake him up , 1 believe , physically and socially . It might help to restore that self-respect which seems to be rather mortified in him , and might set him up like a man on his two legs . We must remember , " the doctor went on , as Mr. Nathaniel Alden frigidly compressed his lips and kept a severe silence , " we must remember that in a few years Peter will have a considerable income at his command . It would be a safeguard that he should already have been trained in taking care of himself and of his money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alden said at last , " hut if we teach him to squander his money now , how would that help him to use it well later ? If we can not rely on his sense of duty , I am afraid we can do nothing for him . We must allow the laws of life to take their divine course . " Dr. Hand , rebuked , bowed his way out , and Mr. Alden , victorious , closed the funereal front door after him with a certain silent but excessive application of force , which expressed his intensesatisfaction ; partly at shutting that lewd fellow out and partly at remaining safely locked and solitary within . IVIF the expedition to Wyoming had been designed for any other purpose than moral reform , it would have been a great success . First , the prolonged journey over the prairies by the new Pacific Railroad , and then another prolonged journey by stagecoachand cart to the shores of a clear lake at the foot of pinecladmountains : all with the charm of novelty , of small unforeseenadventures , and of ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter was a godsend : the wholesome mixture of cleanliness and roughness : the cooking , which the boys did for themselves : the few holiday school books , all redolent of the simple life , all breezy and full of adventure : a little of the Old Testament , a little Xenophon or bits of the Georgics , with tales of Drake and Nelson and Captain Cook : miscellaneous talks about India , where Mr. Lowe had learned  --  admirable missionary  --  more than others had gone to teach ; and above all the curious company of the backward lads themselves , odds and ends of maladjusted humanity , especially the son of an Indian Rajah , who surpassed all the other members of the party both in backwardness in learning and advancement in experience . " Do n't be ashamed , " Mr. Lowe would say in his five-minute sermons before supper , " do n't be ashamed of being backward lads . We are all backward lads in God 's sight . Be good fools , and brave enough to be humble , and you will be wiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man is only one of God 's many creatures ; here in the wilds you see how little the pride or the welfare of man counts in the universe . Just as a woman is quite as good as a man , if she does n't try to be like him , so a backward lad is quite as good as a forward lad , or even better , if his backwardness convinces him that a man can be as near to God in the last and hindermost pew in church as in the first stall in the choir . Therefore do n't be offended if this camp is called the backward lads ' camp : it is a term of affection , and there is a sacred text which I rejoice to repeat in secret : The last shall be first . ' " This doctrine made a deep impression on Peter . He felt slack4142 THE LAST PURITAN and weak , and knew that under the mask of stiffness his Boston friends were weak also . Shams were everywhere : and it filled him with a curious sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to think that perhaps it was the ultimate function of mankind to be a set of ne'er-do-wells in the universe . So , at heart , were these enormous pines , these shaggy bisons , these fer- rets and beavers , these trout and these leaping salmon : all mak- ing a brave show and just keeping alive , hut each of them doubtless a ne'er-do-well like himself in its private destiny . A Rajah was a lord of the earth , and probably quite dazzling on his gilded throne ; but look at him here in his little person : unspeak- ably helpless , amiable only in being shamelessly devoid of any pretence to dignity . Peter was almost reconciled to falseness in others and to helplessness in himself . Circumstances had let him off easily ; he was able to be merely helpless , and not false and murderous as well . These backward lads were a rum lot , yet he had never felt so free and happy : is in their company . The Rajah 's son in particular . Peter helped him in his lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of morals , with vivid illustrations of how to pot it in practice . The scene was not commonly laid in any Oriental paradise , but in Leicester Square . Pagan vices to this dusky youth were splendid virtues ; and he confessed to no weakness except that of being incapable of going it strong iii all the vices at once . Peter laughed : he was sorry for rich lame ducks , such as the Rajah 's son and himself . It was hard lines to be pushed into high places , and have great things expected of you , when by nature you were poor , dingy little mice , only desirous of scampering about and nibbling , and busying yourself in a corner . And were these little hidden pleas- ures really so little ? Where else was there any poetry , any jus- tice , any truth ? Was the great public honourable world any- thing really but pasteboard and trombones ? Genuine cowboys would sometimes ride into the camp for a halt or a meal , or for some fresh medicine , of which Mr. Lowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed habitually with two young Englishmen who had a ranch in the upper valley . The cowboys , and more especially the Englishmen , gave Peter hints which he relished , hints that Beacon Street was not the whole world . It was possible not to have heard of that place , or not to be impressed by it , as the Englishmen were not , even though they had heard of it . Peter had been restless at home without knowing what else to wish for . Sometimes he had ingeniously found his way to India Wharf  --  you may live in Boston all your life without coming on visible evidence that it is a seaport  --  and he had wondered what would happen if he should run away before the mast , like RichardDana . But he was too young and too undecided : and his loose day-dreams had ended in sneaking home again with a vague sense of guiltiness and impotence . Now among the Rockiesthe map of the world began to take colour in his fancy : the impulse to travel became definite . He devoured Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons and places that Mr. Lowe himself or the boys , or the visiting neighbours , happened to mention . He remained languid physically , but his eyes and his fancy were brightened : he became , in a quiet way , the wit of the camp , and Mr. Lowe 's right hand man ; and the report that went home at the end of the summer was so favourable , that the promise to send him to Exeter and Harvard had to be fulfilled . His brother Nathaniel , after the manner of merchant families , was scrupulously formal in all matters of contracts and promises : on the other hand Peter 's good conduct did n't in the least reassurehim : the boy was born a black sheep ; his mother  --  their father 's second wife  --  had come from Baltimore , almost a Southerner ; and could anything good come out of the South ? ThereforeNathaniel instinctively looked about for some honourable means of getting rid of Peter : Peter reformed and conventional would trouble him even more than Peter frankly gone to the dogs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . He would thus himself be a sort of accomplice in the catastrophe which would befall in any case ; how much more safely his conscience could watch that vindication of the moral law from a distance ! And a means of escape was indeed at hand , no less honourable than convenient . Peter had another relative quite as close as himself , and no less competent to take charge of him : his half-sister Caroline , married long since to a prosperous banker , Mr. Erasmus Van de Weyer . Nathaniel did not visit her , although both families spent the summer at Newport ; but there was no quarrel : simply a suspension of intimacy , which was also a suspension of hostilities . He and this lady were no blood-44 THE LAST PURITANrelations whatever . His widowed father had married her widowedmother when the two children were old enough to feel the oddity of suddenly acquiring a new parent and a new brother or sister , almost grown up ; and they had always called each other brother Nathaniel and sister Caroline with an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made the boy feel inferior ; and the girl 's capacity for mischief and freedom of speech profoundly grieved his Boston conscience . She put grasshoppersand caterpillars into his bed and tacks in his chair ; to which he could only retaliate by severely calling her minx . Luckily , she had married very young and had gone to live in distant New York : but- now Providence seemed at last to justify her existence in his eyes . For what could he more suitable and satisfactory than that she atoI her respectable husband should relieve him of the Ishmael ? Prudently , through Cousin Hannah Bancroft , who ( lid visit the Van de Wcycrs once a yea ' , negotiations were opened . Carolinehad received the suggestion with enthusiasm . The family lawyers had at ranged the details , and nothing any longer preventedthe eflc ( ivi guardianship of this sorry lad , deceptively promising to turn out well after all , from being transferred to the other side of his family . Nathaniel would thus be spared any further immediate contact with evil ; while the Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally callous as they were , would proh ; tbly shrug their shoulders when ( as would happen ) Peter petered out . This was the only pun Mr. Nathaniel Alden was ever known to make , but he repeated it often . When the return of the prodigal was imminent , Mr. Alden , by appointment , paid a formal call on his stepsister , to make , as it were , an official transmission of the charge . He was received in a large airy drawing-room , with French windows on three sides , through which the sunlight and seabreeze , on that warm September afternoon , streamed in , only a little softened by wire screens and lace curtains . Beyond , all was green lawn and blue ocean , without a neighbour in sight : and the good gentleman could n't help breathing a slight sigh , as if all this openness , in filling his narrow lungs , found there some painful obstruction . How different was his own Newport dwelling in the older part of the town , scarcely separated from the main street by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PURITAN 45bushes , while behind the house a strip of rough ground sloped shabbily down to the harbour , between a second class hotel and an old lumber yard ! For a moment he almost was envious , almostashamed : yet a second look round the room restored that sense of superiority which was necessary to his moral being . Whatever he had and was must be right , whatever he had n't and was n't must be wrong : else how should he face the universe ? This first axiom of his American ethics was at once verifiedby observation . His own so-called country-house , viewed from outside , might seem a little smothered , like his life : but what rightness , what austere elegance , what quietness within ! Whereas this wide-open , glaring ostentatious place was essentiallyvulgar . The room was littered with little sofas , little armchairs , little tables , with plants flowering in porcelain jars , and flowers flaunting in cut-glass bowls , photographs in silver frames , work-baskets , cushions , foot-stools , books , and magazines , while the walls were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , like those in his own house ) , but etageres with nick-nacks and bric-a-brac , feeble water-colours , sentimental engravings , and slanting mirrors in showy frames . Could the mistressof such a house be the daughter  --  to be sure , only the stepdaughter  --  ofhis own father , so single-minded , so strict , so horriblymurdered ? But here at last was the lady herself , who had evidently been prinking . He rose stiffly , and what was his surprise , when before he had had time to observe her , she seized him by both arms and gave him a warm , soft , frank kiss on the cheek , with an audible smack to it . " Nathaniel dear , " she cried , " do sit down here beside me , and let us talk . Now we are more brother and sister than ever . How really beautiful of you to give me back my young brother ! It was almost as if I had lost him . I feel like Elsa in the Opera , and you are like Lohengrin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she added , laughing merrily , till her eyes sparkled with tears , " nor like the swan ; but you are behaving like an angel , and that 's enough . You are bringing me back my dear little Peter out of nowhere . Do n't you remember , when he was a baby , how I used to take him in my lap , better than any doll , and work his arms and legs to make sure that he had joints ? And he liked it . It was the greatest amusement of his young life . So it 's going to be again now . Erasmus  --  my hus-46 THE LAST PURITANband , you know  --  Erasmus and I will limber him up . We 'll make him dance and play croquet and polo and run after the young girls , till he forgets all about that low company which you say he has been keeping . What has he really done ? Out with it ! It would n't be fair to Rasmy and me not to let us know the worst , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gambling , or drinking , or women ? All three , perhaps . Some of these boys are so rapid .... " Nathaniel , in his nervous embarrassment , had no time to frame an answer to one question before she had rattled on to another . He saw before him a blooming young matron , dazzling in the multitude of her gauze flounces , all frilled and edged with lavender satin , her enormous chignon , for which several good chestnut heads of hair and a horse 's tail must have furnished the materials , her diamonds and laces , and her bunch of pink roses , nestling in a bosom so thinly veiled , as altogether to eclipse them in tender attraction . Surely this spurious sister of his was a dreadful woman . Could any true lady be so bold and outspoken ? She was n't like the gentlewomenof his family , but rather like some barmaid out of Dickens , or some wicked Duchess in eighteenth century memoirs . Was he possibly placing his unhappy brother among fast , spendthrift , unprincipled people ? Meantime Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't think it had been gambling ; he could n't say it had been drink ; he was n't absolutelysure that it had even been  --  been anything immoral  --  but .. . " Then I see . It 's been nothing . He went on some lark in the South End . Of course . How old is he ? Eighteen ? Just the age to be foolish . Young boys underestimate their powers of being agreeable , and look for some easy conquest among maidservants or country wenches . It 's their inexperience . I daresayyou can remember when you were like that , only you draw a long face now and try to forget it . " " I ? " Nathaniel gasped in astonishment . Caroline had a warm temperament , and she was accustomed to gallantry , real or assumed , among her masculine acquaintances . She did n't suspect that it would have required more heroism for Nathaniel to yield to temptation than ever for St. Anthony to resist it . " No ? Were you always absolutely faithful to your youngTHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How touching ! Even after I had left you and married somebody else ? How romantic ! " " My  --  my love for you ? " " Of course . You do n't mean to say that you did n't know that we were in love with each other ? Of course we teased and were both insufferable : that 's how children show they are in love when they have n't been brought up nicely . Poor mamma was so beautiful that she had to neglect us : all very beautiful women are slaves to their looking-glass . But the occasion for you and me was irresistible . No girl of thirteen could possibly have missed it . Two children , utter strangers , becoming suddenlybrother and sister in the same house . Flow prevent an embarrassingpassion from springing up ? Especially when the hopeless , romantic , illicit attachment could so easily end happily , since after all we were no relations whatever ! Nathaniel , why did n't we have our own way and make a match of it ? Why did n't we ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for me , we must n't say it would have been better , because of poor dear Rasmy , who makes such a good husband . Yet who knows ? " Nathaniel , slowly deciding that it was all a joke , a very bad joke , tried to smile a little , and changed the subject . Being one of Peter 's trustees , he wished to ask what allowance she thought Peter ought to receive while under her care . " How much has he got ? " Nathaniel never could bring himself to mention , and even tried to forget , the total value of his fortune or that of his brother . It would have sounded so large , and yet , as they made use of it , nothing could have been more moderate and simply decent . " Really , " he said , " I do n't dare trust my memory of the figures , but if all goes well he will some day have a good income , a handsome income . That is not the question now . With his school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for clothes , travelling , and charity ? Would ten dollars a month be too much ? " " Ten dollars ! That 's not enough for his washing . I 'll ask Erasmus , and we 'll let you know . But he must have enough to be well dressed . I do n't allow shabby clothes in my house . No : do n't become self-conscious and look at your old black suit . It 's not shabby , only old-fashioned : in fact , rather distinguished . I48 THE LAST PURITANtell Rasmy his clothes always look too new , as if he had n't got used to them . You have better taste in old Boston . Only "  --  and she leaned over confidentially towards his corner of the sofa  --  " you might have a fresh pair of gloves . Wash-gloves , soft chamois , are better in summer , cooler , looser , cleaner , better for the health , and "  --  she added in a stage whisper , coming so close to his ear that her scented curls tickled his check  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal hand . " Now , dear Nathaniel , you must come to see us often , especiallywhen Peter is here . To lunch every Sunday , if you will . Let 's call it that . " " I thank you , indeed ; you are most kind ; but my health is delicate , and I never go out to meals . And when Peter is with you I think it would be wiser for me not to conic at all . One can hardly bear to speak of such things , but you know what has happened : the dark shadow that hangs over the recent past for me , and even for him , though at his age such trials arc lighter . Our family life has become sombre . With you Peter will start afresh . Let us hope the end may be happy . In any case , for the present , I 'm sure his surroundings will he most agreeable , and I should be sorry to cloud them with an incongruous presence . " Mrs. Van de Weyer said good-bye to her stepbrother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiss him . VFoR two years  --  at Exeter , at Harvard , during his holidays at his fashionable sister 's , shyly but observantly , playing with her young children , and being humorously civil to her guests  --  Peter decidedly bloomed . He did n't study very much ; a little , with his intelligence , was more than sufficient for the tasks assigned ; but he acted in the school theatricals , wrote for the school and college paper , became the wit of his class , and even played a little base-ball . His languid figure grew somewhat better knit , and his rather pale countenance and irregular features assumed a pleasing expression . To his surprise and positive incredulity , everybody seemed to like him . He in his turn began to cherish certain affections ; not so much for people  --  with all people he was vaguely tolerant and amused  --  as for books and certain aspects of nature . He went for solitary walks ; he read the minor English poets , Thackeray , Montaigne , Don Quixote . In his Freshman year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequented the front row at musical comedies , and the stage door ; but he took these pleasures sadly , and in his tipsy moments would call a friend aside to observe that his only real desire was to fade into the midnight with no pain , and that now more than ever seemed it rich to die . Yet on the morrow , looking perhaps a little thin and sallow , he would escape into the country , go canoeing on some sluggish river or deserted pond , and feel that in his heart he was a second Thoreau . So he might have drifted , sentimental and futile until youth was gone , had not a tragic incident befallen . There was a secret society at Harvard to which everybody of consequence belonged ; the rites of initiation were prolonged and terrifying , and often included some prank to be performed in public or at the public expense . When Peter was " running "  --  for the neophytes were forbidden to walk  --  he was commanded to break one night into the Chapel and purloin the College Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red velvet cushion , was perched at a great height , and approached4950 THE LAST PURITANby two steep flights of steps with brass railings . In the dark , Peter had felt his way to the summit , and already held the ponderous tome in both hands , when sudden calls from his friends and tormentors posted outside warned him of danger . He listened for a moment : they seemed to be dispersing at full speed ; he was being abandoned : should he leave the Bible and try to slip out , or should he carry it away to he hidden in the basement according to plan ? At that moment he felt a rough hand seizing him , and instinctively , like a staunch Israelite , he brought down the whole weight of the Holy Scriptures upon his adversary 's head . The hand let go ; there was some movement , a heavy thud muffled by the carpeted stairs , and then silence . Peter put the book back on its cushion , felt his way unmolested down the steps on the other side , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered . Outside , in the rarefiedwintry night , the coast seemed clear ; and he went home to bed . The next few days were full of summonses , interviews , and secret negotiations . Mr. Nathaniel Alden was again compelled to confer with Mr. Ilead , Dr. Hand and the Rev. Mr. Hart . Even Mr. Erasmus Van de Weyer appeared on the scene , having actually made the journey from New York to Boston in order to advise Peter , and to exert a friendly influence in the inner circles ; for he too was a Harvard man and had belonged to that secret society . So , very fortunately , had the local magistrate . The upshot was that at the inquest the night watchman , who was not a member of the town police , was declared to have met death by misadventure . In the opinion of the medical examiners it could not have been a blow on the head given with a soft flat instrument , such as a book , that could really have been fatal , but rather an accidental fall against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislocated the vertebral column at the neck . No evidence was available against Peter , except his own confession , attenuated as much as possible by the lawyers : of course , honour forbade the members of the society to remember who had received the order to enter the Chapel , or who had given it . The public part of the initiation was suppressed for a year or two : a fund was provided for the widow , and anonymously bestowed ; and since many a false or true rumour was current concerning the event , it was thought best that Peter shouldTHE LAST PURITAN 51temporarily disappear , not only from the college but from the country . A tutor was found to take him abroad , and in the first Cunarder that sailed from East Boston , the modest Samaria of 3,000 tons , the crestfallen young man , feeling himself a criminal , slipped away unnoticed and began his long wanderings . A few months later he reached the age of twenty-one , and came into his money . Wealth did n't ruin him . The only charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than poverty all the constraints to which your conventional rich man was subjected : pompous business , pompous society , pompous speeches , and a gold watch-chain heavily festooning a big paunch . Peter 's impulse was to ramble , to observe , to follow up , not too hopefully , little casual adventures and acquaintances . But how to justify such a life of idleness ? His liberty dragged the lengtheningchain of a bad conscience . In vain he alleged to himself that his health was frail , and rather cultivated frailness . In vain he made some attempt to serve the sacred cause of science as an explorer or a collector . He could explore only what others had discovered , and collect what they had thrown away . His modesty disinclined him to that voluminous nullity which fills so many books of travel : yet the sidelights of any undertaking interested him more than its alleged purpose . He vegetated , physically lazy and mentally restless ; grew stale while still half-baked ; heard something of everything and learned nothing well . It was universallyagreed among his Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned out badly . Only one circumstancepreserved him from complete condemnation : his life in remote parts and even his most ambitious journeys absorbed only a fraction of his income . He was growing richer and richer ; and his brother Nathaniel , beneath the dead silence which separatedthem , could n't help warming a little towards him on that score . Even the idle rich , if they saved money , were useful membersof society . They were the camel 's hump in the body politic : their function was to repair the waste of a spendthrift democracy . This public utility might even , in time , restore the truant to his self-respect ; and the most wind-blown character might ultimately reach port if only it had a golden ballast . Sometimes , at table , on a day when a favourite dish or a rise in stocks or a crushing defeat of the Democratic party had brought a glow of suppressed satisfaction into Nathaniel 's face , 52 THE LAST PURITAN Cousin Hannah would venture timidly on the dangerous sub- ject , and perhaps she would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter . He is in Japan . " And then , if a loud " Hmph " of pretended indifference , ill concealing a natural curiosity , en- couraged her to go on , she would report how enchantingly child- like and exquisitely sufficient everything seemed to him in that country ; how he had taken a house all made of paper , with little servants who waited on him with the most picturesque cere- many at the lowest imaginable wages ; how he slowly boiled him- self in his bath , out of doors , during half the day , and spent the other half taking painting lessons or picking up curios in the shops : and how  --  but here Cousin Hannah would drop her voice , hesitate , and blush a little  --  now he had married , temporarily married , a little Japanese lady , with her parents ' approval . " Hmph , " Nathaniel would mutter again . " Unprincipled peo- ple never remember that it 's not only on themselves that they bring trouble . Suppose there was a child to this marriage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could we decently recognise it ? And what sort of place could the spurious brat ever find for himself in the world ? How often have you heard me warn Peter , when he was a small boy , that crooked ways are always longer than straight ways , and that wanderings , physically , morally , and etymologically , are errors ? He may now think it a tine thing to be a planet ; but a planet never shines by its own light ; and it 's very little light , and very pale , that it can ever rcllcct . " " And yet Venus , Cousin Nathaniel  --  is n't Venus the evening star ?  --  is so beautiful ! " " Hmph , " he repeated , " no metaphor goes on all fours . Peter was never beautiful , and you 'll see what he looks like  --  a wreck - when he comes home . " Six months would pass , or a year , and Cousin Hannah would seize another favourable moment to say quietly , " There is fresh news from Peter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved , his little wife and her family showering blessings and multiplying kow-tows on him at his departure . He is in China : has chartered a junk in which to sail up those great rivers far into the interior , while living all the time , so to speak , in his own house . He is seriously studying the language , which he says is not so very difficult if you approach it in the right way , with- out our prejudices : and he underlines that this time he has no wife but only native men-servants . " " They have told me at the office that he 's in China ; also that he has been drawing out unusually large sums of money . I suppose it was to pay for those kow-tows and for that junk . Let us hope he wo n't be wrecked in it , or robbed , or  --  or worse . " Cousin Hannah knew the fatal word he had in mind , now doubly tabooed in that household , and hastened to change the subject to something pleasant and unimportant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carvings , the best of which he means to bring home for the Museum of Fine Arts . Such things are ex-pensive . " " Undoubtedly he will be paying many times what they are worth . I know what it is to buy works of art . It would he safer to ask Doll &; Richards to send out an expert to buy them for him . " " But , Cousin Nathaniel , think of the pleasure of choosing them himself ! Very likely by this time he too is an expert , and with more taste than a dealer . " " I dare say . But they 'll cheat him . " The news which poor Cousin Hannah had to repeat was not always pleasant . Expurgate it as she might , she could n't conceal the fact that Peter was often ill : now fever , now dysentery , often simply restlessness , tedium , melancholia . He had left China for India , and visited the native court where his old friend of the Backward Lads ' Camp was now Maharajah : but there the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tottenham Court Road somewhat dashed his dream of Oriental loveliness . Moreover , the heat was deadly , the food indigestible , and only the religion  --  Mohammedan  --  appealing . In search of a dry climate , the simple life , and Islam in all its purity , he had passed over to Arabia : was living at Muscat  --  said to be the hottest place in the world  --  in an upper chamber in a great brick tower : was learning Arabic , was being instructed in the true faith , and riding at dawn or sunset over the limitless sands , or skimmingin a pink-sailed dhow over the dancing waves of the Gulf of Oman . But all was in vain . That very tedium , that hunger for something less disconsolate , which had driven him to such places drove him away from them . Every country no doubt had its54 THE LAST PURITANcharm , its rightness , its friendliness to the native mind ; yet everywhere the natives suffered and grumbled , everywhere the ruling system was hated and threatened , while everywhere the solitary foreigner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East had really little to teach us which we could profit by learning , and we had nothing good to teach the East , except indeedhygiene . All the rest which in fact we were teaching , or attempting to contaminate them with  --  our industry , politics , religion , or philosophy  --  besides being grotesque for them and unnecessary , was all infected among us at its source , and thoroughlyrotten before we exported it . Their own curious tenets and practices , after the romance of novelty had worn off , he found unspeakably tiresome and foolish , except one only , which rendered all further religion and philosophy superfluous : namely that there is no power save Unsearchable Power , and that what will be , will be . Melancholy gained on him from day to day : any relief to be found in travel or drink or drugs only intensifiedthe gloom and the hopelessness of the next attack . He might as well return home . It was useless for the leopard , or for the piebald cat , to dream of changing his spots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least the hospitals and insane asylumsin America were the best in the world . He would go home and study medicine . But the climate , the voices , the rush , the hypocrisy , would he be now able to stand all that ? His courage gave out ; he started , but stopped half-way . Was n't Europe " home " relatively ? Was n't the Mediterranean the " home " of our civilisation ? And in the next years , if the reports , which Cousin Hannah made to Mr. Alden over his beef-steak and boiled potatoes , had less romantic interest , there ran through them a certain hopeful trepidation . Slowly , fatally , the truant was cominghomewards , the culprit was preparing to reform . " I have splendid news from Peter , " she said one day , " he is settled at Vienna , and studying medicine . He finds it all so interesting , so absorbing , so gensiitlich ! He is going to make a speciality of mental diseases . Think how useful that will be for him when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoothing his thin hair which was now fading from sandy to greenish white .

THE LAST PURITAN 55It is a store-house of profound knowledge . We sane people little know what astounding depths would appear in us if we allowed ourselves to go mad . " " Not really ? " " Yes . Evil depths . " " Then , " Cousin Hannah gasped , chilled in her enthusiasm , " let us hope Peter will turn to some other branch of medicine . There is such a crying need , for instance , of investigating cancer . " " I am afraid cancer is an evil too . " " But so di flerently ! " And the good lady put off further communicationsabout Peter until a more auspicious occasion . Indeed , what further news she received was seldom cheering . There were long silences , when Peter had been ill , or resting torpidly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once he wrote : " I am at Nauplia . Near by are the ruins of Tiryns and Mycena : ; a castle overhangs the port where was the ancient acropolis ; and round the point is Epidaurus , with a steep cockpit of an ancient theatre , between the mountains and the purple sea . How forlorn is all that greatness ! How squalid what remains ! The sturdy fishing-boats , streaked with blue paint and daubed with ikons , creak against the stone pier ; probablynot unlike the ships of Homer , even if not wholly black . ' They may even be called swift , ' because when you sail in them with a fair breeze , the waves rush by the side with a hurrying music ; and swiftness is not a question of miles an hour to a poet , but of quick gain and quick loss . Above all it is this sense of being borne along resistlessly , but insecurely , through a multitude of ephemeral scenes , none very new , some beautiful , many distressing , and all irrevocable . " A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris : " Am sitting here by an insufficient wood fire , that is always dying down . I am making vain efforts to forget whether I am cold or not , and to fix my thoughts on the big book before me , and on the sesquipedalian medical terms which adorn it . I long for my boat Calypso and the sunshine of the south . Living in houses with a spying concierge and two talkative families on each of the six storeys is distracting to me after the seclusion and discipline of a ship , and the breadth of the desert . Excellent as Charcot 's lectures are on insanity , his spirit and outlook are foreign . It is56 THE LAST PURITANcurious natural history to him , not souls undone . I am getting too old to accustom myself to new moral climates . It would be a pity , too , after pottering for so many years over medicine and psychology , to let my studies drop without having an officialstamp set upon them , so that at least I may prescribe quinine for my own fevers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm really coming home . Do n't be alarmed . I sha n't invade you in Beacon Street . Does n't Mr. Morgan in New York live in his yacht moored off the Battery ? So I mean to lie at anchor off South Boston or Nahant , and by assiduous attendance to duty , persuade the Harvard Medical School to make me a doctor . " Thus at last , as the rolling hall at a gambling-table runs at first briskly round the outer rim of the fenced circle , and graduallyreduces its speed and its courage , until after one or two false rests , it settles definitely into the predestined concavity , so that erring Peter reverted irresolutely to his native shorts , turned up his coat collar against the freezing east wind , frequented autopsiesand corridors strongly smelling of disinfectants , dined on off nights at the Tavern Club with two musicians , a poet , and some occasional foreigner , and at the belated age of thirty-five received from his old Alma Mater , as it were sub rosa , a higher but imperfect degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston Blue Book as Peter Alden , M.D. I le was rehabilitated , re-christened , almost forgiven ; but he did n't feel at home . He never practised medicine , only put to the proof that misleadingadage : Physician , heal thyself . Without being exactly hypochondriacal or imagining symptoms of strange diseases from which he was happily free , he aggravated his real weaknessesby continually dwelling on them . He dosed himself cautiously , but indulgently , drank a good deal , and dismissed , one after another , various sorts of food as dangerous . He even experimented on his own person with certain poisons and antidotes , infections and antitoxins , half in mild scientific earnest , half in an idle craving for some new sensation , some enormous dream , which he might laugh at the more sarcastically afterwards , the more overwhelmingly real and enlightening the vision had seemed . He cared little for his life : if things ever went seriously wrong , he could always put an end to it . Meantime , so long as he was tolerably comfortable , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his own carcass . He picked up a few old acquaintances and even made a few new ones ; sailed to Florida or the Bahamas in winter , to Mt . Desert or the Saint Lawrence in summer . The Atlantic Yacht Club elected him a member , and he ceased to be black-balled at the Somerset Club . His brother Nathaniel , who of course belonged and lived almost next door , luckily never went there . Peter instinctivelyavoided passing in front of his father 's house . He would turn by preference into Mt . Vernon Street , because  --  as a kind female relation interpreted his action , when one day she found him there standing almost still and looking about him  --  because that upper part of Mt . Vernon Street ( said she ) was so pleasant and distinguished , with its great elms and its deep gardenlike grass plots before the quiet sunny old houses ; and a pensive and travelled person like Dr. Alden could n't help loving that spot , and walking more slowly when he passed through it . Yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had preoccupiedhim , but rather this very trick of his in avoiding Beacon Street and making aimlessly this particular circuit . Was he morbid ? Was he neurasthenic ? Was he abnormal ? Were there twisted nerve-fibres and criss-cross sensory-motor arcs in his brain , that caused him to act like a fool and to feel like a child , and might any day turn him into an idiot ? Had n't he better consulta specialist , and protect himself from himself before it was too late ? VI " YES , " said Dr. Bumstead to his daughter , on an evening when anxious talk had kept them up for a full hour beyond their customary bed-time , " that 's how matters stand . Luckily both the boys are doing well ; they can almost support themselves on scholarships and odd jobs ; yet at a pinch it would be cruel to refuse them a little assistance . There arc not many people in Great Falls , Connecticut , who can afford to consult a specialist in their mental troubles . Days and weeks pass without anybody calling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a millionaire  --  has been a godsend . For his own good ( I say it in all conscience ) the treatment should continue . And now that summer is over he ought n't to go on living in his yacht at New London . It 's bleak and lonely , riding at anchor in that broad river , swept by cold winds and rain ; and the trip up here twice a week in an open launch involves too much exposure . Besides there are psychological reasons . As a physician , I must dissuade him from staying always on board his own boat , isolated and surrounded only by men , and men who are his dependents . It 's one thing to go sailing amid all the variety and excitements of a rough voyage : it 's quite another to lie idle and moping in port , without change of scene and without society . Such a life favours regrettable inclinations and morbid thoughts . Once Dr. Alden comes to live with us , I shall be able to treat him daily , watch all his habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will be able to take long walks  --  the best form of exercise for a man of his age with his thoughtful temperament . We have those two lovely wood roads , round the Asylum grounds and over Cemetery Hill . Good heavens : to think that not so many years ago , in my father 's time , all that land was ours ! And now I 've had to sell even our own frontage on BumsteadAvenue . What else can we do ? The new edition of my book has had a good press , but the sale is disappointing .  --  You need n't call him a boarder , except in the census returns . He will be a paying guest , a friend , a colleague , an invalid needing quiet and care ; all the more as his residence here wo n't be permanent58  --  renewed often . I hope , but intermittent . Those eccentric privatepatients require a light hand . They 're not like your commonrun of crazy old dolts huddled in the wards . If you pull such a knowing man up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a sad thing if Dr. Alden bolted . I must urge him to go this winter on his usual cruise to the West Indies . Then in the spring he will be all the more willing to return to us , feelingthat he is n't going to be hoodwinked or confined or hypnotisedinto giving up his favourite pleasures . Confidence is essential : we ca n't do anything in such ticklish cases without confidence . You 'll see , he is very modest , unassuming , considerate ; not forward to criticise anybody ; used to all sorts of food and all degrees of discomfort ; yet quite familiar also with the best of everything , and withering you with the most merciless underhand sarcasm , if you dare to conceive that your way of thinking or living is better than his . That 's the difficulty in curing him . He does n't love what we call health . He scorns it .... " The next spring was singularly balmy . Crocuses and snowball blossoms were out in April . New sap seemed to be mounting also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairsseemed less benumbed ; in May Peter Alden had returned and established himself in the family : and in September matters had gone so swimmingly that Dr. Bumstead could say to his daughter : " Look here , Harriet . An idea has occurred to me . It may startle you ; but why should n't you marry Dr. Alden ? " " That idea does n't startle me at all . " " What ? You 'd thought of it yourself ? The plan does n't displeaseyou ? " " Why should it displease me ? Did you think I was dying to marry some long-haired musician or vulgar commercial traveller ? At least Dr. Alden is a gentleman . " " Very much , very much of a gentleman . He 's a bit rickety in body and mind ; there have been times when he has drunk too much , and indulged in a little cocaine or opium or both ; but he 's not to be regarded as a reformed dipsomaniac or victim of the drug-habit . It has been simply a little deliberate weakness in prescribing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without caring for the remoter consequences . He recognizes this6o THE LAST PURITAN I THE LAST PURITAN 6rhimself : and his health could be rendered excellent by a regular regimen and by home life . He 's still youngish , hardly forty . A good-looking , strapping young woman like you would be the saving of him . " " You must n't think that I have n't observed him for myself , " Harriet answered . " He is a man of refined temperament who has been unfortunate in his associations , and who under better influences could retrieve himself . A family life is the only healthy one for any of us , as Dr. Alden would have done well , for his own good , to have remembered earlier . My own fault , perhaps , has been to be too much absorbed in the care of others and to forget my own future , when I might remain alone in the world and homeless in my own home . In the end too much sacrifice of oneself impoverishes the character , and diminishes one 's power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r . Alden 's life and mine would be fuller and richer if we were united . Duty seems to point that way . " " Capital , capital , " her father cried . " I 'm delighted that you take that sound view of the matter . I will drop a hint to him , and I 'm confident that he will end by recognising how much such a solution is in his own interests . But there is one point  --  a delicate point -- that we ought to be clear about before we proceed any farther . 1 ) r . Alden  --  of course partly in fun  --  often says that he is a woman-hater . His experiences with the fair sex  --  and he has had them in plenty  --  have not always been fortunate . He 's a little blast ' . Besides , he has lived so much apart from women that he is more at home in men 's society , and prefersit . A club man , a confirmed old bachelor , and one physically in any case not very vigorous , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are naturally full blooded ; and when it comes to married life , I ask myself whether you would be well matched ; whether , to be frank , he could satisfy you . " " Father , " Harriet cried , red with indignation , " how can you , how can you say such a thing ? Do you take me for a nymphomaniac ? If Dr. Alden prefers the society of men , it 's probably because he has n't ever met any decent women . I do n't blame him : how could he find them in those outlandish places where he has always been travelling ? And besides , I can return the compliment . As far as society is concerned and affection and true personal spiritual love , I infinitely prefer my own sex . Who could be dearer and nobler and sweeter and more intelligentthan Letitia Lamb ? With whom could I ever have a closer union of heart and mind , and one more lasting , and superior to all accidents or moods or conflicts of interest ? Only , for family life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There must be children . But if there are children , do you suppose any woman who respects herself would demand a  --  a -- a useless assiduity in her husband , as if she had married him for pleasure ? It 's an insult to me and to every good woman . " " All right , all right , " Dr. Bumstead said , shrugging his shoulders , and wondering if the course so grandly charted would prove navigable without accident . " I spoke only to make sure . If you are going ahead , I wanted you to go ahead with your eyes open . " " So that 's what they 're after , " Peter Alden said to himself not many days later , after his host and medical adviser had popped the question in the simple words : Why should n't you marry Harriet ? " The scheme , I must say , is the old man 's rather than his daughter 's . Harriet has n't much initiative : which in my view is one of her good points . She merely avails herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship steady on her keel . She would be a fool not to profit by this occasion . And I should be a fool too , if I ran away out of pique , just because they are planning to catch me , when to be caught is perhaps to my own advantage . I have sought everywhere for the kind of life that might really please me : I have n't found it ; it does n't exist ; and I might as well accept anything decent that presents itself . If I did n't marry this young woman , probably some day , in a moment of weakness , I should marry another , older , uglier , and less respectable . I do n't need women at all sentimentally , to pet and to be petted , and socially they bore me to death ; but physically and by a sort of reviving boyish curiosity , I still sometimes fall a prey to them ; and I try to make a joke of what is hardly a pleasure . Arrested at adolescence , they call it nowadays ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to say . Some day , if a fair female  --  my landlady , perhaps , or my laundress  --  burst into tears , clung to me as to her saviour , declared that she was about to become a mother , or that without me she would die or starve  --  I should very likely find myself drying her ears , and leading her to the registry office . Such a6a THE LAST PURITANmarriage might be sordid , but it would n't be troublesome ; less of a burden for a man of my sort than to set up housekeeping with one of Caroline 's lovely young creatures , or with one of my Boston relations , who would require inc to preside with her over two great establishments at least , with punctual engagementsfor every hour of the day and every day of the year , dinners and theatres and concerts and guests and garden-parties and  --  worst of all  --  yachting as the gay world understands yachting ; or else for a change to be lugged from one European Palace Hotel to another , that she might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if , thinking to avoid that predicament , I married a woman of the soulful , sympathetic kind , professorial , emancipated , or religious , wlu would think herself superior to women of the world , but in fact would be desperately inferior  --  then , with her pretensions to understanding and forgiving and directing Inc , she would drive me mad . I should n't he suffered to draw a breath save in subjection and hypocrisy , and no refuge would he left to me but suicide . No : Harriet at least is a happy mean ; a point of indifference , a point of rest . I do n't ask to be happy ; I want to be at peace . If I oust let some Juggernaut car crush my bones , let it be the old homely steam-roller of traditional Puritanism . From earliest childhood I know its crunching sound . Conformity to it is easier , and the necessary lies come almost of themselves to the lips . Indeed , lying in this case is rarely necessary , since silence may he plausibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home with a wife who did n't remind me a little of good Cousin Ilannah : utd of Brother Nathaniel . Harriet is so completely immersed in her local existence , that she hardly knows there are , or ever have been , any other standards ; her proud ignorance of history and of the world keeps her content with her one-horse town , her vaporised religion , and her sham mansion . She will never wish to desert them . Her highest ambitionis to be the universally recognised first lady of Great Falls , Connecticut : and with a little money , that ambition will be at once realised . " And this place suits me : remote enough for troublesome friends not to look me up , and near enough for me to reach anybodythat I care to see . I am comfortable in this house . The old man , with his professional apparatus and his professional hypocTHELAST PURITAN 63risy , will quit , and will leave us alone in it . It can be made to look again rather stately . This false classicism pleases me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anybody gave out such architecture for a success , it would be ludicrous , but regarded as an intentional failure , as an act of allegiance to a lost cause , it 's honourable enough : an aspiration to nobleness . It marks the modern man 's hopeless assumption that he is still a gentleman . These lofty square rooms are still inhabitable : we can conceal the radiators , and keep great logs smouldering in the fire . This hall , intended to be monumental , is really commodious ; the fountain and marble statue in the hollow of the staircase are at least not an elevator . We can restore the ground floor in the style of the period , and wallow upstairs higgledy-piggledy among our old duds . I will insist on a Chinese room for myself , and Harriet can arrange all the other rooms as she likes them . In walking up and down these dignified stairs , we shall have time to recompose ourselves for the change of atmosphere , in passingfrom solitude to society , or vice versa ; I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which each probably cheats himself , to the deceptions with which he probablydoes n't deceive other people . Let us endeavour to preserve our genteel traditions for one generation more . If I have a son , I should like him to start from there . God knows where he will end . " As for Harriet herself , she 's a first-rate woman : if I tried to fare better I should fare worse . She is good-looking , in perfect health , thoroughly a lady in her punctilious provincial fashion , reposeful yet a good manager , observant yet never nervous , fussy or meddlesome . Really , for a sad chap like me , there 's nobody better . I can stand her mind , or lack of it , because really it makes no difference to me what a woman says . I can hold my tongue . God knows I 'm weak enough , but somehow I 've escaped a weakness which seems to attach to the strongest characters , in that they ca n't bear it if anybody is not of their own opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind ; especially as I know very well beforehand the sort of thing it will be . I believe I get the best of this bargain . " As to actual love , and all that , she 's a fine female , almost as fine and vigorous as a young male ; a little passive , a little sad ; somewhat like a blond athlete past his prime , and grown a bit64 THE LAST PURITANfat , soft , slack and sleepy . Will she be too much for me ? No : a sleepy Juno has always attracted me more and disgusted me less than your frisky , flirtatious , pouting young thing , or your elderly vampire . She will be indifferent , or will pretend to be so ; that tone , at our time of life , is more becoming for both of us . If we have children they will profit by her strong constitution . Her eye is blank and a little cowlike , but her features are noble , and the mouth pure and firm . She has n't a sense of humour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look for is not companionship but peace  --  something to decide me , to attach me , to render extravagant impulses impossible ? Her queenliness is an asset : battered as I am , though only a few years older than she , I feel as if she were the patron goddess who was to receive the defeated hero , and welcome him home from his wanderings . She has consciously undertaken to heal me , to do the mother in the wife . I have never really known a mother , never enjoyed the voluminous soft protection of a wise woman . Caroline was merry and kind , but at bottom too contemptuous . She hated sick children . A boy , especially , must look after himself . She just laughed at me , pushed me into the water , and told me to swim . I did n't quite drown , for here I am ; but I swallowed a lot of salt water . A stricter and more prudent woman , a sort of priestess , might have sent me on my voyage better provided : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Harriet and the children at home  --  if we have children  --  I shall be more safely ballasted . If I still venture sometimes to spread my sails  --  and why should n't I ?  --  I sha n't put to sea like the Flying Dutchman , plying from nowhere to nowhere . I shall hail from a recognised respectable port , being duly registered and legally owned , in a word , married ; and all the customary currents and trade-winds of the watery globe will lead me round again here . I 'll break up The Old Junk with her exotic ornaments , and build a clean new yacht to be called Hesperus . Hesperus , the poetess of Lesbos says , brings all things home : wine to the lip , the goat to the fold , the child to the mother . " VIIMANY a time in later years the rich organ of Harriet 's imagination , always softly playing , would change its stops , and from the somewhat shrill key of apology and self-justification would drop into the basso profondo of an assured happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine she had been holding fall on her lap , draw the folds of her handsome dressinggownabout her large person , and close her eyes , the more luxuriously to re-live the scene which in all her uneventful existencehad remained most vividly and most satisfactorily imprintedon her memory . How often she had rehearsed it , how perfectly she knew it by heart , how completely the kindly conspiracyof forgetfulness here and revision and expansion there , had transformed it into a perfect picture of her masterful good sense , her true kindness , her high principles ! Again she saw herself sitting idly by the long west window in the front parlour , where Letitia and she always went to admire the sunset : it was rather lurid that afternoon , and the October blast was driving the red and brown leaves rather rudely over the rough grass  --  not yet that well-mown and well-watered lawn that it had since become . Letitia would soon be there : she said it was so bracing to walk up the long hill after working for two hours in the Public Library : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There she was , " said Mrs. Alden 's lips moving inaudibly , " I knew her step  --  and besides no one else would come in without ringing .

And see what a beautiful book , on the English Cathedrals , the superintendent has allowed me to take out , although it 's starred . Such exquisite engravings ! ' " ' Put it away , ' I said severely , and listen to me . We have something important to talk about . Dr. Alden has proposed , and we are engaged to be married . ' " ' Harriet Bumstead , ' she cried , you do n't mean it ? ' " ' Yes , Letitia Lamb , I do . It will be for the best . ' " Ah , ' she murmured , but a man ! And how old is he ? ' " ' Not old at all , for a man , ' I replied impressively , and6566 THE LAST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens ourselves . Of course , Letty dear , if a man had proposed to you , I should n't have expected you to accept him . But you 're so exceptional you ca n't eat bread and butter without a fork . And a husband  --  well , my dear , I know what you are feeling . Men are necessarily coarser than women , and for you to have a man near you , even the gentlest , would be distressing . You have so many resources in yourself , read so many languages , know so much about art , and can feel so deeply about Shelley and Botticelli . Besides you are independent . Remember that I have n't been brought up like you in a young ladies ' aviary , flitting about as light and free as a canary bird . One grows fond of one 's burdens and home has always been everything to me . For years I have had to keep house for my father , and to look after my young brothers , hearing men 's talk , and what 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of ghastly diseases . Doctors are always aware of all those horrible organs which we have insideof its , and they must be ready to touch even the commonestpeople without a shudder . It hardens , but it prepares for life . And after all the life of a married woman is fuller , it brings one so much closer to others , with so many fresh opportunities of doing good . ' " ' AIL ' Letitia said pensively , and apparently more reconciled to the idea , wealth does make everything easier  --  even , I suppose , marriage . ' " ' Yes , my dear . And wealth is such a power . ' " ' And such a responsibility . ' " Of course , but I fully realise it . And in any case I have a sacred charge committed to me already  --  this wonderful old house , one of the most beautiful in the world , what would become of it if I do n't preserve it ? It 's fast getting out of repair . The paint and even the wood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns . The carpets are faded and threadbare , the furniture shabby . My brothers ca n't live here , there 's nothing for them to do at Great Falls . My father has reached the age-limit and must resign ; he can be only consultingphysician at the Asylum on half salary . We should have had to sell the rest of the land ; the trees would have been cut down , the view shut off , and soon the house itself would have to go , for you know it 's mortgaged . What would become of us ? THE LAST PURITAN 67Poor father would die of it , and I should have to be a schoolteacherand live in a boarding-house . ' " ' Do n't , Harriet , you hurt me .

We have actually had an offer for the house , nine thousand dollars , for this historic treasure ! And that 's not the worst of the insult . Mr. Bangs of Bangs ' Hotel wants it for a wayside inn for commercialtravellers on Sundays , where liquor might be sold after hours and where , as my father says , fat newly-married couples in buggies , and without baggage , might flock to take rooms on a summer evening !

" Being the first to recover I said , Letitia , do n't let 's be weak . It 's not going to happen . Dr. Alden even intends to buy back the last lot we had sold , and turn that new brick house into a gardener 's cottage and stables ; and the whole place is to be fenced in and restored in the original style , which is Revolutionary , because of these big white columns like Washington 's Tomb at Mt . Vernon ; but Dr. Alden calls it Empire , pronouncingit Ompeer , because he rather likes to be French sometimes ; and the summer house is to be rebuilt in real marble , just like the one he says it 's copied from . ' " ' Rome , Villa Borghese , Temple of Diana , ' Letitia murmuredalmost in a trance , how well I know it all !

The providential thing about I ) r . Alden is precisely that he must live just here , ca n't bear to go away from this very house where his health has improved so wonderfully under Father 's care , and where everything is as he likes it to be . Boston , indeed ! What on earth should I be doing iii Boston ? ' " ' Oh , ' Letitia whispered dreamily , gazing hard into the sunset , perhaps I had n't understood . Dr. Alden has so much delicacyof feeling . Perhaps he is only asking to become one of the family in order to live here always as a friend . Ile means that you 're to be like brother and sister .

Marriage , ' I went on , marriage in real life , especially between old friends who arc no longer very young , is n't like love making in a cheap novel . Did you expect Dr. Alden and me to be spoony ? What if he did n't kiss me , provided he gave me a ring like this ? ' And I showed her the splendid diamond which I 'd purposely turned inwards toward the palm of my hand , so that she should n't catch sight of it prematurely . " ' Oh !

He hopes we may have children  --  has actually wondered which room would make the best nursery  --  and of course I hope so too . Think what that will mean to both of us ! ' " I saw tears in poor Letitia 's eyes , and I took her hand . No , dear , do n't think that whatever happens you will be less to me than before . On the contrary . As time goes on , if ever you should feel lonely or poor  --  and I may very likely feel lonely myTHELAST PURITAN 69self some day in this great house  --  I shall now be able to ask you to come and live with me : or if that did n't seem best as yet , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you much better than before .

' " And the poor thing kissed me , and wiped her eyes , and hugged her precious library book under her cloak  --  for lap-dogs were n't allowed at Miss Doe 's  --  and without saying a word began to trudge home in the twilight . It was so delightfully easy , she always said , going down hill : and she loved to feel the first wanderingflakes of the winter 's snow strike and melt against her hot cheeks . I love Letitia ; she 's a superior person ; but she 's hopelesslysoft ! " Thus triumphantly the scene faded from Mrs. Alden 's inner vision . She had once more viewed the perspective of her life as she liked to view it . As she opened her eyes , and ran again mentally over the years that had elapsed since her marriage , she could n't help congratulating herself afresh on her wisdom . How much her influence for good had increased ! The BrowningSociety having become so large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new women , she had been able to form a select Shakespeare Society to meet in her own house , and have only really nice lecturers : Dr. Alden , indeed , did n't seem to think Browning a great poet at all . And did n't the house and grounds attract visitors even from abroad to admire them , which never had happened in the old days ? And did n't the portraits of four generations of Bumsteadsclergymen , lawyers , merchants and physicians  --  one of them by Stuart  --  look down from the dining-room walls , three times each day , on little Oliver ? What a privilege that was ! Such noble surroundings must be a daily inspiration to the boy , even if he seemed for the , moment unconscious of it : and she must admit without boasting that her own character had greatly developed , and that she could exert a double moral influence on the boy , to make up for the fact that physically and morally his father was not more vigorous . Not that anyone could call him effeminate  --  aninveterate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor looking at everything in the cold light of science ; but at the same time so quiet , so silent , so secretly sarcastic . It almost seemed that he had a debased side , as if nothing could shock70 THE LAST PURITANhim ; his smile was like a surgical instrument , half hidden away , not intended to hurt , but yet terrible . He respected nothing ; and if he was n't gross , it was only because he could n't be . When he pulled the bow of his evening tie  --  because he always dressed for dinner , even when alone , and there was something uncanny about that , like dressing up for one 's own funeral  --  when he tied that neat bow he would laugh at himself in the glass , thinking , she was sure , of all the filthy savages that he had seen runingnaked , and all the unspeakable practices of the heathen Chinee  --  and she believed he positively liked those abominations , would enjoy defying all Christian decency , if only it was n't too much trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from me ! Only he is too much of a gentleman to show it , when he is here , except by running away as soon as ever he can . What a blessing , in those first days , that we had the house to talk about . In that first winter in California it was the great bond between us ; wherever we went we looked in all the antiquity shops for Ompeer treasures ; we picked up a lot of beautiful things . They seemed to me extravagant then , I had been so cramped for money . Now I understand that they were good investments , and that we could sell them to-day for twice the cost . " Money was such a comfort . What would have become of the house without money , or of herself , or of little Oliver ? Would the child ever have had the energy to push his way undefended through a hard world ? And as for Dr. Alden , but for his money he would now be rolling in the gutter . This sad fact seemed sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him melancholy . Yet how could it ? Whatever might be said of Dr. Alden ( she always thought of her husband as " Dr. Alden " ) at least he never interfered with the child 's education . In fact the Doctor was seldom at home , and Oliver knew him only as a sort of Saint Nicholas in plain clothes , or a tame pirate out of the works of his namesake Oliver Optic , who turned up occasionally from parts unknown , brought him beautiful presents , pinched his ear , called him " Sir , " and asked him quizzical questions to which there was no answer . Evidentlyno depressing influence could flow upon the boy from that quarter . And as to heredity , was n't she herself the daughter of a physician , a renowned specialist in nervous and mental diseases , and did n't she know perfectly that according to the latest scienTHELAST PURITAN 71tific opinion acquired characters could n't be inherited ? Now if Dr. Alden had regrettable traits , they were all due to his own choosing and doing : his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's faults did n't in the least resemblehis father 's . Oliver was n't lazy , nor feebly tolerant , nor provokingly humorous . Fortunately he harked back to his remoter ancestors , and took everything seriously . He gave intenseattention , understood at once , and never forgot what he had learned : yet he had an odd way of looking at you sometimes as if to say : " And is that all you have to teach me ? " She could n't conceive what was the matter with the child . His little heart always seemed to be set on something else , which nobody showed him . In any case , it was n't her fault . She could n't have been Oliver 's only parent , though certainly , if nature could have managed it , that would have been the best arrangement . Nothing could have been wrong with him then . But since he had to have some father , what better father could she have provided for him ? None : because until Dr. Alden came to stay as a private patientin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Falls , Connecticut , that a truly refined and cultivated person could think of marrying . The clergymen all had wives , except that sinister curate at St. Barnabas ' who believed in celibacy . The young doctors at the Insane Asylum were poor Jews or Irish , and the travelling lecturers never stayed long enough to take notice . Even Letitia Lamb , who travelled so much abroad , and had actually met both Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr .. Bernard Berenson , had remained single . Of course Mrs. Alden might have done so herself , and been proud to be Miss Harriet Burnsteadfor better or for worse : but in her it would have been selfish . It was imperative not to let the really good old families die out , especially now that the country was being swamped by inferior races . A Daughter of the American Revolution could not prefer her own comfort to the claims of posterity . Posterity was Oliver : and though he might suffer in some oblique way because of his father 's weak health and over-refinement , after all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And indeed he was a good boy , tall and strong for his age ( as she had always been ) and nice looking , though perhaps a little pale and with grey eyes open very wide that seemed to see nothing . Yet in time  --  72 THE LAST PURITANfor he had a good mind also  --  he would realise what rare advantages , what splendid opportunities , he enjoyed , and how happy he ought to be . Even on his father 's side there was much that was favourable . If the Aldens in recent times had been less pleasantly distinguished than the Bumsteads  --  with her father 's work on Psychiatry world-famous , and so much sounder and more decent than Krafft-Ebbing 's  --  yet the Aldens had genuinely come over in the Mayflower , and Oliver had the inexpressible privilege of being descended from those famous pilgrims , Priscillaand John Alden , immortalised by Longfellow in his householdclassic , The Courtship of Ali/es Standish . Such were the reflections which often passed through Mrs. Alden 's mind as she reclined after lunch in her room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merely to exist and to possess an exacting laxly that must be washed and clothed and fed with anxious attention is an exhausting occupation enough for a lady in middle life : and Mrs. Alden 's happiest days were those on which she had no engagements and could devote her leisure to judicious self-congratulation on her past actions and her present position . In a qualified way she might then congratulate herself also on her young son , and even on her husband . But why could n't her satisfaction in the latter ever be complete , and why must her reflections always end by confessing that Oliver had been rather unfortunate in his father ? PART IIBOYHOODITILE child had been born punctually . This first grave and alarming duty of entering into the world was performed not only unflinchingly but with a flourish : for this thoroughly satisfactorychild was a boy . His little organism , long before birth , had put aside the soft and drowsy temptation to be a female . It would have been so simple for the last pair of chromosomes to have doubled up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future body complete , well-balanced , serene , and feminine . Instead , one intrepid particle decided to live alone , unmated , unsatisfied , restless , and masculine ; and it imposed this unstable romantic equilibrium on every atom of the man-child 's flesh , and of the man-child 's sinews . To be a male means to have chosen the more arduous , though perhaps the less painful adventure , more remote from home , less deeply rooted in one soil and one morality . It means to be pledged to a certain courage , to a certain recklessness about the future : and if these risks are to be run without disaster , there should be also a greater buoyancy , less sensitiveness , less capacity for utter misery than women commonly show . Yet this compensation is sometimes lacking . Mysterious influences may cross and pervade the system , and send through it , as it were , a nostalgia for femininity , for that placid , motherly , comfortable fulness of life proper to the generousfemale . Had the unborn Oliver decided to be a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been blamed . Such a result would have been equally involuntary , equally normal , equally useful ; yet somehow it would have been disappointing . Our admirably gentle and admirably stern Oliver Alden , always choosing the darker and the ruder duty , would have missed existence . Or he would have begun  --  and how wrong that would have been !  --  by cheating his mother 's hopes . Because while Mrs. Alden alwaysdeclared that women were intellectually the equals of men and morally their superiors , yet she would have felt that a little girl was only a second-best baby : and how ill that would have gone with her settled determination that everything in her new7576 THE LAST PURTI'ANlife  --  except perhaps her husband  --  should be absolutely first rate ! No : Providence was rewarding her for aiming high. 1 he child was a fine boy , full weight , perfectly formed , fairskinnedwith large grey eyes , and a little fuzz of limp , yellow hair . At the first contact with freedom he wagged his arms and legs about vigorously , experimentally , silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , willing to wait and see . Philosophy possessed the soul of this child from his first breath : inarticulately , of course , as it was destined , at bottom , to remain always ; because the words which his education suppliedwere not capable of uttering it truly . But in action , in determination , and by a sort of inner blind fortitude , his faith was distinctly in him front the beginning . There were good things and there were baud things , and there was an equal duty to pull through both and come out somehow on the further side of all trouble . At least , so I venture to pert it into words for him , words which would n't have satisfied him ; but at this first moment of Iris existence I may presume to understand him better than he understood himself. 1'hc wisdom of these dumb principles was at once confirmed by the ministrations of doctors , nurses , parents , and officious friends . ' I'Iicy all helped him to attain good and avoid evil and to endure beyond , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the first to take him in her arms , admire his completeness , and sigh a little at the tender , the tragic mystery of life . An experienced nurse , almost a ladydoctor , at once took him in charge . An old iron-handed eightdayclock in a white apron and cap could not have been more punctual . The bath , the bottle , the change of linen , the way of being vigorously tucked into his cot , or strapped into his perambulator , seemed to have been decreed by the Medes and Persians . Experience , duty , and science left little to chance . And life , at least physical life , in the model infant responded perfectlyto each appointed stimulus . It was seldom necessary to cry ; it was never appropriate to laugh . His education , in spite of such excellent diligent masters , was carried on exclusively by himself . It consisted in learning the places of goods and evils , and the way they followed one another . That wagging of arms and legs , together with the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to beTHE LAST PURITAN 77very useful for this ethical purpose . Goods and evils turned out to be arranged in a circle or sphere , in what nurse called his skin , or a little under this , in what she called his tummy ; but there were some goods and evils that escaped beyond or came from beyond , such as the bottle when it was not yet or no longer in his mouth ; and these potential goods and evils , which nurse called things , extended very far and had a tremendously complicated life of their own , which Oliver himself afterwards called the world . Even that was not all : for deeper down and higher up than his tummy , there were a lot of other goods and evils , not traceable by the eye , nor possible to run after and take hold of with the hand , when they showed a tendency to run away : and these were himself , his mind , or soul . The mind was the most entertaining and satisfactory region of all in which to keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and provided the evils were not too violent , like being carried away from what you wanted to do to what you did n't want to do , it was most amusing to have that private world of your own , and talk to yourself about it . Every day accentuated the difference between himself and what happened to him . Living , real , and self-justified was only his own will , the inner spring of his being , the centre and judge of all that unaccountably went on . The world might sometimes seem obsequious and willing to be commanded : but presently it became tiresome , did what it should n't do , and showed itself to be cruelly alien , besetting , and unavoidable . This inexplicable wrongness in the world extended inwards sometimes into his own person , when his hands and feet would n't do things properly , or he choked or sneezed ; all such interference of himself with himself was most ignominious and discouraging . Yes , and something even worse could happen . Fatality , or alien accident , could invade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where at least he ought to have been able to play as he chose . But no : things would sometimes go wrong or run thin even there . The interest would die out , the pictures would fade or become ugly and frightening , and you could n't stop the silly old words repeating and repeating themselves . These were private hidden troubles , not frequent or serious : they could be dismissed when you were really awake and doing anything important , such as filling your pail with gravel . Little78 THE LAST PURITANOliver escaped almost all the ills of childhood : he was never really hungry or furious , never very ill or much hurt . But when he was hurt at all , he was deeply injured , because his feelings were hurt also . He ought not to have been hurt : why , then , was he ? Even when he grew old enough to understand that sometimes it was his own fault and sometimes other people 's and sometimes nobody 's fault , but just chance , he was far from reconciled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored up his resentment or his discouragement . Even when things went well , he could n't be really joyful . They had gone wrong so often , they would probably go wrong again soon . Why make such a show of gladness ? All explanations and apologies , all invitations to see how pretty things were , and what fun it would be to play at this or that  --  though he listened quietly and looked attentively and played as he was told  --  left quite undiminished and unreconciled the deep displeasure that had sunk into his little heart . It was a proud displeasure , firmly condemning and rejecting everything that was wrong : but though almost everythingmight be wrong , the inner oracle that condemned and rejected was sure of being itself right , and was not in the least dismayed . Round this coral island , just risen above the sea but invisibly planted on the rock-bottom , the strongest waves were compelled to break : and not only could this young microcosm turn them into a fringe of foam following its own contours , but it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt of calm ancillary lagoons , round which the surf of persistent circumstancemight pound all day quite harmlessly , and be muffled by distance when , prophetically , it sounded through the impenetrablenight . Miss Tirkettie  --  such was the nurse 's name  --  was admirably fitted to look after the baby before he could walk or talk , the first of which he did long before the second : action for him was the simpler , the quicker way of escaping and finding new ground . Yet even action had its difficulties . The first and most serious in his case was to find something to do . There were no other children to play with . The nearest neighbours were not friends of Mrs. Alden 's , and their children would not have been well-behaved or well-spoken , and probably rough and dirty . There was Fuzzy-Wuzzy , the gardener 's dog : it was Letitia Lamb that had given him that nice name  --  and neverthelessTHE LAST PURITAN 79Fuzzy-Wuzzy would always be running away after the more exciting society of other dogs : because , as Mrs. Alden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might give a dog a nice name she could n't give him any biscuits . Why should n't nurse , then , who evidently was n't poor , as she always had biscuits in her cupboard , give Fuzzy-Wuzzy a few , so that he might play with Oliver ? Because , Mrs. Alden replied ( changing , as she often did , the ground of her argument ) , it was very bad indeed for dogs to have anything between meals . Fuzzy-Wuzzy , however , as far as Oliver could see , never had any square meals , but only bones and rats and rubbish that he could pick up in the stable-yard : and if you never had any meals why should it be so bad for you to have something between them ? But Mrs. Alden and nurse were adamant on the subject of biscuits . They could n't pronounce the horrid word , but they looked at each other significantly . The dog had fleas . He must be severelyencouraged to go and scratch himself elsewhere , in the loose company of other measly dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too ignorant to know that FuzzyWuzzywas the right name for him , and always called him Yep . In the absence of a dog , sometimes a sparrow or a butterfly would come hopping or fluttering over the lawn , in that beautifullylevelled , watered and mown part of it where Oliver could be taken out of his baby-carriage and allowed to run about free , or even to sit and crawl , after a rug had been spread under him to keep out the dampness . The butterfly or the sparrow might tempt his toddling steps and his top-heavy precipitate little runs : but the naughty creatures would always escape , and sometimes leave him unexpectedly and ignominiously sitting on the ground . Miss Tirkettle was scientifically trained ; she knew no songs , no stories , and no prayers ; and Mrs. Alden , if she had ever known any , found them tedious and uncanny to recall nowadays . They were lost in thin ghostly memories of her mother 's time ; the masculine medical atmosphere of her father 's day , and of her own housekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futile and dangerous it was to impress misleading vacuous emotions upon a tender mind . Poetry and mythology and religion and remote history had nothing to do with life . Later , when Oliver was older , he might some day come upon songs or stories or prayers in books or theatrical8o THE LAST PURITAN ritualistic performances : and then he might form his own judg- ment about them , if they interested him at all . His education must n't begin by stuffing him with nonsense . It must be a direct preparation for right living in the modern world . All this Mrs. Alden very pointedly observed to her husband . " I do n't agree at all , " she added , " if you think Miss Tirkettle too old , and want the baby to be handed over to some chit of a silly nurse-maid who would tell him ghost-stories . And next , perhaps , you will be wanting somebody to teach him his prayers . Why should the poor child be made to recite meaningless Ian- guage like a parrot , and be filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose , he may be able to under- stand better why , in the Middle Ages , they burnt people at the stake . Science has shown how vital these first years are , and how such early morbid impressions warp the mind and weaken the character . The child will have enough to struggle against , with his burdened nervous inheritance . At least , let us not be- gin by making him superstitious . " " No , no , " Peter replied patiently , accustomed as he was to having his wife put words in his mouth which he never uttered , and impute feelings which he never felt . " Prayers and ghost- stories are not what I had in mind ; not even fairy-tales . And I particularly do n't want a common nurse-maid , quite the oppo- site . I should like his English to be fundamentally pure : then all the abominable speech he will have to hear will seem to him absurd and amusing . He need n't be troubled by it , and wo n't imitate it . I ) id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants ' way of talking , though we hear it every day of our lives ? It 's because we recognise it for a dialect apart , which is not our own . That 's the way anyone to whom good English is natural must regard the common speech of the day . I suppose it 's more important to have the feelings of a gentleman than the speech of a gentleman : but the things are closely allied . No : I want a lady-nurse , a good governess for Oliver , who will play with him and inspire him with good manners and good feelings , not by precept only , but by attraction , so that he may disdain the opposite vices . I want a lively person who will wake up his wits and chase him about and help him build his castles of blocks so high that he will laugh when they topple over . And why should Moses in the bulrushes or Noah 's Ark or Jonah or David and Goliath be a whit more religious to a child 's feeling than Gulliver or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will simply fill his fancy pleasantly , and accustom him to enjoy intellectuallywhat is enjoyable in this world  --  which is mighty little . " " Useless ! " Mrs. Alden replied , with an air of settling the business . " I have tried reading to him out of that Mother Goose book that Letitia gave him . He would n't listen , would n't look at the pictures , and was peevish ; he wanted to get down on his legs and run after his ball . He seems to be happiest and strongeston the physical side . " " Luckily he has your physique : he is very fortunate there . " Peter said this with a little bow . He liked to pay his wife compliments with a sort of playful gallantry . It was an apology , in his mind , for not really loving her : and yet he genuinely admired her in a certain way . She might have been Juno , she might have been Ceres , if she had n't been Harriet Bumstead of Great Falls , Connecticut . On that warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiring the after-glow of the sunset between the huge white wooden columns , fluted and without a base , like those of the Parthenon . Here he was allowed to smoke , and he relighted his cigarette before continuing . There was a project he had long meditated , without ever daring to propose it . Why should Harriet disapprove of it , as he felt in his bones she would , when it was so clearly in her interest , in the baby 's , and in that of Letitia Lamb , her oldest and dearest friend ? " You mention Letitia . How would it do to ask her to look after Oliver ? She is n't too young , she is not superstitious , and she 's a lady . We might invite her to live with us , and pay her a nice little salary besides , so that she would be laying by a penny against a rainy day . She is fond of the child , and he of her . She could very easily teach him his letters , until we find a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " Mrs. Alden replied in a tone of superior but good-humoured competence . " How could I ask Letitia Lamb to give up her life-work , and her yearly trips abroad ?  --  You know this year she is again chaperoning the Toot girls ; such a treat for her , actually taking them to Greece and even to Crete , to see those wonderful excavations ! How82 THE LAST PURITANshould she dream of stopping her lectures on Renaissance Sculpturewhen they have proved such a success , and when she has just discovered how much better a subject for lectures sculpture is than painting , because in showing paintings on the screen the colour is lost and so much detail confuses the audience , while photographs of statuary are perfectly adequate , in fact thrilling and better than if you were looking yourself at the originals in a casual way , as one does in tiresome museums and dark cold churches ? You have no idea how hard she works , actually wearing out her eyes , and how she positively delights in the history of art . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city like Great Falls , are very well attended . Last year she cleared nearly a hundred dollars . And with such a success and such a vocation , how do you expect her to sink into a common governess ? It would be an insult to propose it . You forget that she 's my very best friend . " Somewhat imperceptive , in fact , Peter Alden had been , as he now perceived . If the mysteries of life-long friendship excludedLetitia , what other governess could they find ? " I only wish , " Mrs. Alden went on , " that there were a suitablekindergarten in the neighbourhood . Miss Bibb 's is not properlyequipped and is too far away . I should have to send the child every morning in the coupe with Nannie . That would involve Patrick to drive , and both of them again in the afternoon to bring the baby home Two servants ' time almost swallowed up just in taking a little boy to and from school ! I could n't bear to have such a thing going on under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse completely tired out , coming twice up this long hill with that heavy carriage . What 's the good of keeping a carriage at all if I can never drive out ? You will say : Get another horse ! You are so extravagant and thoughtless about money . Letitia would n't tell me how much you sent her for Christmas , but I 'm sure it was far too much . Very well : suppose I buy a second horse . Then Patrick will complain of overwork and ask for another man to help in the stable . Endlesstrouble and waste . Children are a terrible puzzle . " Things were in this pass when an unexpected incident gave a providential turn to Oliver 's future . IIMRS . ALDEN 'S younger brother Harry was at that time pursuinghis theological studies at Gottingen , where tepid philosophicalcurrents , set up by the eloquence of Lotze , continued to temper truth to the shorn lamb . Among those red-tiled roofs and modest gardens , he lodged in the house of the widowed Frau Pastor Schlote , whose elder daughter gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much younger daughter , Irma , who had recently returned from England , where for some years she had been a teaching pupil at St. Felix 's School for young ladies at Southwold in Suffolk . Irma , too , sometimes gave German lessons : but her chief employment was to help in the household . Sometimes she even waited at table ; and then , flushed with the heat of the kitchen and the pride of making herself useful , she would sit down at her place at the foot of the board , and enthusiastically and accurately impart all the miscellaneousinformation which travel and foreign residence had given her . She was just as happy in knowing how to make perfect Eierkuchen or to carve a goose , as in knowing the beautiesof English literature and even the splendours of English society . A certain sympathy soon established itself between the ardent Irma and young Harry Bumstead , and one holiday , on an excursion to the heaven-piercing ruins of Schloss Hochstein , things came to a head . The two young people , alone of the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turret and most thrilling Aussichtspunkt of all , when Fraulein Irma suddenly felt dizzy , fainted or threatened to faint , with imminentdanger of falling into the ravine , hundreds of feet below , where a torrent romantically boiled among the wildest of rocks and bushes . It became necessary for her gallant escort , who was a strapping fellow , to detain her in a strong embrace , and help and almost carry her down from that eagle 's nest , as the guide book called it : and the expression of trust and rapture with which , feeling herself restored to safety , she slowly reopenedher eyes , while her head continued to recline on the shoulder of her protector , left little doubt in his honest mind8384 THE LAST PURITANabout the state of her affections . He himself was far from indifferent . Irma , if not conventionally pretty , seemed to him angelic in soul and in body ; and with his Christian-socialist leanings he particularly admired her joy in work and her abilities as a Hausfrau : while the tenderness of her heart went with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful to all the science of all the textbooks . What an ideal helpmate for a future liberal clergyman or professor ! But alas ! it was incumbent on him , as an honourableman , to beg Irma the next morning for a private interview . She knew at once by his stunned expression and funereal tone that she must n't expect , this time , a proposal of marriage . And indeed he began by telling her that his future was not free . Before leaving America he had become engaged to the young lady who gave out the hooks in the Williams College library . It had been an attachment of long standing , ever since his Freshman year : and on his departure the lady had promised to wait for him as many more years as might be necessary : and meantime she was religiously saving every penny she could spare from her modest salary , in order to help one day to set up their house-keeping . They wrote each other weekly letters , artless and rambling , full of the interests of the moment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more already like the letters of a happy married pair than of separated and pining lovers . It was a sacred engagement . Howeverwarm and deep might be the friendship and sympathy which he might find elsewhere , he could offer marriage to no one else . Fraulein Irma was wonderfully calm , calmer and calmer the further her friend proceeded with his explanations . She felt that she was living through a tragic hour , like the Lotte of Werthers Leiden , and that , cruel as this sudden blow might be , it was lifting her to a higher plane of heroic life and giving her a deeper , broader , truer spiritual insight . How much better she would plumb henceforth all the wisdom of that great saying of Goethe 's Entbehren sollst Du , sollst entbehren ! And with what a doubly heart-rending but yet nobler note would she sing hereafterEs war ein Traurn and Behiit ' dick Gott , es hat nicht sollen sein ! She bit her lips for a moment and then said quietly that she thanked him for confiding his secret to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their earnest true friendship would always continue as before : and she did n't break down until safely locked in her own little attic , where she could prudently smother her sobs in her virgin pillow . In half an hour she was almost herself again . Her amativeness was generic , and she could easily turn her innocent thoughts upon some ruddy young officer , bursting in his corsets , or some pale poet-like student , in a great slouch hat and goggles , after twice encountering either of them walking round the pleasant circuit of the old town walls . Life was still so rich , so full , so wonderful : and the world was , achl so beautiful ! Young Harry Bumstead , on the contrary , was hard hit . The blooming Irma seemed by contrast to cast a drab and melancholy shadow over the prospect of keeping house for ever with the worthy but not very young librarian of Williams College . Well , that could n't be helped . He would find courage and happiness now in his work , and later in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a morbid conscience , reproached him with having thoughtlessly caused the lifelong misery of this tender and innocent creature . Would she die of love ? Would she ever bring herself to marry anyone else ? He wished he could make some reparation  --  though he had done no harm  --  and find something substantial to offer to Irma in lieu of marriage . And a postscript to one of his father 's letters opportunely suggested what that substantial something might be . " Harriet , " Dr. Bumstead wrote , " asks to be excused for never writing to you . She says she is too busy with the baby . The fact is she is rather troubled about nurses , etc . Mothering is not her element . She is better at introducing a lecturer or presiding at a ladies ' meeting to protest against organ-grinders . Even when the child was smaller and could n't ask questions , it annoyed her if the nurse left him with her for a moment , and she had to pick up his rattle for the third time . Yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at their wits ' ends to find anybody worthy of bringing him up . They wo n't put him to school here , because Alden thinks us poor folks too common ; and they ca n't send him to a boarding school , because Harriet says boarding schools deaden the mind and stereotype the character . " Just the thing for Irma : to take charge of a rich little boy 's education . The thought no sooner struck the young man 's mind86 THE LAST PURITAN ' than he set himself to realise it . Letters , photographs , proposals , difficulties , finally cablegrams of acceptance passed in breathless succession . It was well , Mrs. Alden had written , that Fraulein Schlote should be young , with experience of teaching , and knowledge of so many languages , and of music and history and science : but would n't a clergyman 's daughter tend to be bigoted and narrow ? However , her brother reassured her , explaining how far Fraulein Schlote , though deeply religious in her feelings , was from forming any abstract notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society and the conscience of man . In fact , if anything Ilarriet vould lint her too liberal , too pagan , because she was a great admirer of ( ; oethe , and felt how beautiful a healthy sensuality was to round out the character , and how important it is to develop harmoniously every side of our nature . " Very well , " Mrs. Alden replied . " Let her come on trial . But as to sensuality , healthy or not , let her clearly understand that she wo n't have occasion to develop it in my house . " Fraulein Irma herself was no less pleasurably excited than if her marvellous new life had included the prospect of a husband . In planning and in action , she and her dear friend Harry became comrades once more , and all sentimentality was forgottenin the excitement of adventure . Harry met every objection , got round every difficulty ; and when from the deck of the great steamer at Bremerhaven she waved a last adieu to her sister and to her friend , who might so easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . Alone , yes ; but travelling first class  --  Dr Alden had arranged all that  --  and especially recommended to the Captain , by whose side she would sit at the principal table : such a fine old grizzly German officer , portly but vigorous . She was Eva in the care of Hans Sachs . Leaving her Fatherland , yes : but not for the first time . She knew well already , young as she was  --  only just twenty !  --  what it meant to live alone in a vast foreign world . Going to live among utter strangers , certainly ; but only for six months , unless everything turned out happily . And the little boy she was to educate  --  here she took his photograph out of her bag and contemplated it for the hundredth time  --  what a beautiful refined head he had  --  so Nordic  --  and what a sweet , serious expression . If she had been engaged as governess to a genuine German Serene HighTHELAST PURITAN 87ness  --  who might have had nasty troublesome older sisters to make faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **25;4158;TOOLONG . Of course there were no titles in America , so you never could be quite sure that you got people just in the order of their real importance . But at least her patron was a Herr Doktor ; and what was more , and rare among doctors , a very , very rich man , which nowadays was an equivalent for everything else . And after all little Oliver  --  what could be more natural ?  --  wouldone day be President of the United States ; and she would go down to history as surely and gloriously as if she had been the beloved teacher and guide of some young Grand Duke or even of some Imperial and Royal Highness .  --  But she must now go down to her cabin and take her medicine , so as not to be sea-sick ; and on the way down she observed that , although all the German passengers she came across seemed to be Jews , one or two of the ship 's officers were just as good-looking as the Captain , and younger . THE advent of Fraulein Schlote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom everything depended , smiled on the new- corner from the beginning . The first glimpse of her had been a great relief . A foreign governess had suggested so many un- pleasant possibilities , even crimes : might n't she steal Mrs. Alden 's jewels , or have some secret paramour , or set fire to the house , out of sheer wickedness ? But no : this was no tall , thin , dark , severely critical foreign woman , with aristocratic pretensions ; no embittered grand lady , compelled by adversity to become a de- pendent in a family of rich barbarians , whom she despised . This Irma was all smiling deference and unfeigned admiration ; such a little blonde thing , too , looking very young for her twenty years , a mere child , yet not too pretty or well-dressed ; not a possible rival or critic at all , but more like a loving pupil or a grateful poor relation . She could be trusted to take entire charge of the baby , without becoming a worse encumbrance herself . Mrs. Alden liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Servants were alien presences that made her nervous , like a strange cat in the room . She was unpleasantly aware of them passing behind her back , or prowling stealthily about the doors . It was a strain to feel oneself observed by creatures who , however dull they might be and given to routine , were morally independent and probably hostile : automatic creatures that had to be watched , to see if they continued to work normally , and did what was expected of them . The relation between masters and servants seemed to her profoundly inhuman , profoundly immoral : she welcomed every mechanical device , every social arrangement that might eliminate servants . Her tribe had lost , if it ever had possessed , the charitable principle of Christian society , which made possible a familiar union , devoted and merry , between high and low , and freed a motley world from competition and envy . She could never have been with any grace the mistress of a great household , in some castle or palace filled with wayfarers and men-at-arms , craftsmen hammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singing , young men carousing , and monks begging . She froze at the touch of difference . Superior power and distinction were insufferable : if she could not imitate them she denied them . And the least degree of coarseness or simplicity beneath her own offended her also . Her moral ideal was democracy , but a democracy of the elect . There could be no oppression in imposinguniformity on people who were really all alike ; and such a society exacted from its members only what , if they were honourable , they would exact from themselves . She could n't conceivelife except in a clan , where all the peers should have qual rights and similar virtues . Beyond the pale there could be nothing but outer darkness  --  an alien , heathen , unintelligible world , to be kept as remote as possible . If they could n't grow tea at home , she supposed they must get it from China or Ceylon . And she supposed that if occasionally that dreadful outer world became troublesome , it would be necessary to make war on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing was to ignore it altogether . It ought never to have existed . Luckily in America the immigrant working classes lived apart in their own districts and tenements , like Jews in a Ghetto . One need have no personal contact with them ; and as far as she was concerned  --  for she was n't meddlesome  --  they were welcome to keep up their own ways and religion among themselves , and even their language , if they could preserve it : but as servants in her house they were a dreadful intrusion . This Fraulein was not a servant , but a clergyman 's daughter who might have been Mrs. Alden 's sister-in-law , but for a lucky accident : lucky , because a foreign sister-in-law would have been rather a trial . As a dependent , however , Irma would do nicely , loved the kitchen , which Mrs. Alden abhorred and never visited ; loved the pantry and the closets and the trunk-room and the attics ; knew very soon where everything was , and how to distribute the clean linen , count and lock up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of house-keeping that servants hardly seemed to exist , and when seen looked actually friendly and happy . It was a vast relief to the mistress of the house , a revelationof what comfort meant ; her reward for thinking so unselfishlyonly of what would be best for Oliver , and having consented to admit a strange woman into the home ; but provi-90 THE LAST PURITAN dentially this strange woman relieved Mrs. Alden of petty cares , and left her free to devote herself to higher public duties . Besides , after Oliver had been put to bed , Fraulein could come down again and , sitting on a low stool between the lamp and the fire , could read to her for half an hour  --  such a rest for the eyes : or could even slip into her room and brush her hair very gently and very assiduously  --  which was not only pleasant ( Mrs. Alden would n't have cared much for that ) but excellent for the scalp , where the hair was getting rather thin , and to keep away her neuralgia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of her work . One husband and one child were not enough to fill her life ; and she had decided to have no more children . Of course , as a rule , and especially for people of good old Ameri- can stock , she believed in large families : but in this special case she was sure it would n't be scientifically safe . Oliver himself seemed the child of an old man ; she had read of grave clan- gers in that direction  --  for her , too , child-bearing would be too great a strain . Any woman might bear children ; a person who had a mind should be left free to improve it . It was a blessing that Fraulein could be trusted to interview the cook and keep an eye on the gardener and see that the right rooms were swept and thoroughly cleaned on each day of the week : this enabled Mrs. Alden herself , after breakfast , when her own room had been done , to retire there and rest a little  --  somehow one did n't feel so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Littell 's Living Age or the Atlantic Monthly lying open but unread on her lap  --  for she thought the illustrated magazines rather vulgar ; and as she was sure to hear of any new event or idea of importance at the meetings of the Associated Charities and the Art Club and the Browning Society , not to mention Letitia Lamb who brought all the gossip on the other afternoons fresh from the city , she had really no need to do more than look at the headings in the paper , and at the list of deaths , to know everything that was going on . While she improved her mind in this way and by being well-rested kept her interest in every- thing from flagging , she had the satisfaction of knowing that little Oliver , in the model schoolroom and sun-parlour especially built for him at the other end of the house , was being admirably brought up : better , in fact , than if she had insisted on bringing him up herself . It was simply a fact that young children , how- ever gifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better at first with commonplace artless souls like Fraulein , and ran after them as they run after animals , while the ways of serious highly cultivated people put children off . When Oliver was older he would see the difference and learn to rely always on his mother , as was natural , for guidance and affection . But he was n't ready to appreciate the deeper qualities yet , and he actuallyprofited more by being with Fraulein . " If my friends heard me say this , " thought Mrs. Alden , " they would protest that I am far too modest : but all really superior people are modest . " Peter Alden , too , who was fond of chuckling in solitude , chuckled at the happy chance that had introduced into the householda person so much to his own liking , and this quite on his wife 's responsibility and at the instigation of her favourite brother . Ideally he might have preferred an English or even a French governess , for the sake of a certain refinement and sobernessnot to be expected of Germans : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps needed more the stimulus of an unfeigned enthusiasm . Enthusiasm Fraulein had , as well as an unusual command of languages : when complimented on her excellentEnglish she would say : " I speak also French perrfectly . " Her English was British  --  musical , colloquial , and pure ; yet it escaped the hostility which would have pursued it if she had been an Englishwoman : it was set down merely to foreignness . Peter was delighted to see contraband smuggled in this way into his family with the approval of the customs house ; sometimes the absurdity of life was its own excuse for being . Perhaps , too , a little Teutonic and Lutheran enlightenment might be more successfully grafted on to the Alden stock than any more delicately shaded or exclusive sentiment : and how stout and self-confident that German culture was , compared with the pale native tradition ! Fraulein was a treasure ; but Peter from the first carefully avoided any too warm expression of his satisfaction . He was vaguely civil to the young person ; and he rather hinted to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If Harriet only knew , " he said to himself , " what a balm this Fraulein is to my conscience as a parent , she would send her packing at once . " Irma herself thought the Herr Doktor rather cold and sphinx-like , and was afraid he disliked her ; until on the first Christmas she received92 THE LAST PURITAN THE LAST PURITAN 93a generous present with a card ( from Havana ) inscribed to Fraulein Schlote , with thanks for all her skill and devotion . On a separate slip of paper was written : " You may show this Christmas card to Mrs. Alden , but please do n't mention the cheque . That must be a little secret between us . " The secret , however , was instantly divulged in a letter of sixteen pages to her sister in Gottingen , spotted with joyful tears . As for the child himself , neither the disappearance of his old nurse nor the appearance of the new lriiulcin seemed to impress his young mind . He was accustomed to strangers , and not afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or rather , to his transcendental consciousness , all these bulks movingand doing things , his nurse , los mother , and the rest , were alike strangers , though f:i nili:ui : 111 ( 1 lharmless , like the elephants in the picture-book : and Ior some time Irma too was only a different bulk , slighter and moving in a nimbler way . Gradually , however , he became aware of something else in her : her movements were not jest motions , more or less necessary and expected , like those of Miss Tirkettle ; there was sympathy in them , there was playfulness : Irma was affectionate . Her personalitybegan to percolate , as it were , into his own . Discipline was relaxed : it was no longer imperative to play only with clean gravel especially poured out for him : he might now run and dig up his own gravel from the path : but while he readily availed himself of this privilege , he was not particularly happy over it , or grateful to Irma : he simply forgot that the privilege was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life might have become more plastic , making a little room for caprice . But was caprice less tiresome than law ? Both seemed to be imposed by some mysterious fatality , or by some contagious will which he made his own without really understanding what he was doing , or desiring it . Yet , though he might sigh a little , sometimes , at the tedium of existence , he would never have dreamt of complaining or resisting . Such was the order of the universe ; and his mother said he was much more fortunate than other little boys who were poor and had nothing to keep them busy but must waste all their time playing in the gutter and becomingwicked . It was a distinct relief to discard the perambulator and to trudge along with Fraulein for a country walk . The confinementof that baby-carriage , and the stuffy luxury of it , had become exasperating . Now at least he was a small man on two legs : yet all was not liberty . Sometimes she insisted on holding him by the hand . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover or invent grounds of sympathy with her little pupil . Every pretty flower , every lovely butterfly , every darling bird had to be pointed to , described , and admired . It was good training for Oliver 's ear in the German language , and some initiation into the wealth of nature : but he took all this fervid instruction a little sullenly : he would not have been bored running about silently by himself . And sometimes Fraulein lengthened these rambles more than was pleasant for him . He was no baby , to say he was tired , or hot , or wished to be carried : the old perambulator , even if thought of at such a moment , was not to be mentioned . He would rather bear the ills he had , than fly back to others that he knew too well . If a pebble got into his shoe , it might be unpleasant , but he said nothing . Pebbles were not official reasons for stopping or for turning back and going home , as if it had been time to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the most sacred of the standardsone had to live up to . Pebbles were insignificant accidents , like certain needs of the body : and if Fraulein , gasping with intentional enjoyment , said they must get to the top of the hill , the view would be so avunderschon , the hill must be stoically climbed . The view was nothing to him : but by the time he had plodded bravely to the top , he had forgotten the pebble ; and when later , after running down the hill , he felt it again in a different place , he knew that they were going home and that it did n't matter . Such was the nature of country walks ; and when he changed his shoes and stockings before dinner , he would shake the pebble out . And if it had really hurt his foot very much  --  the pain , he knew , did n't matter if there was no physical harm done  --  he would wash it and put a patch on it , as his father had taught him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both his shoes equally tight , so that pebbles should n't get into either of them . So the young philosopher was educating himself in the essentials : but as to the frills , Fraulein was not remiss in her duty . What better foundation for deep and true learning than a knowledge of the German language ? She knew that this was not one94 THE LAST PURITANof those artificial and accidental languages like French and English , that have grown out of the corruption and mixture of several ancient tongues . It was an original language , a language of the heart : and to teach it the more feelingly and maternally , she would take little Oliver on her lap , and talk to him about the objects to be seen out of the window or in the picture-booklying open on the table . It was not long before he knew the name of everything in German , as well as in English , or better ; and what was more , he could recite German verses and prayers ( though he was n't taught to pray them ) and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite amusement , because Fraulein heat the measure like a Kapellineister , and he did the same : and she said that some day he might be the leader of a great orchestra , and instead of only himself singingin time , he would make sixty or a hundred violins and flutes and trombones keep time with him . This was a great thought , immensely invigorating : for Oliver 's mind was less perceptive than digestive : contact was nothing to it , incorporationwas everything . Anything merely seen or heard remained a picture or a story : that external force , that foreign rhythm , must first pass into him , become a part of his rhythm and of his bent , if ever he was to conceive it clearly or think it important . Once incorporated , once digested , once moralised , the orange was squeezed : its virtue had gone out of it and passed into him : and what the rejected rind or pips or deflated pulp might do or becomein that rubbish heap of non-moral abstractions which seems to surround us , left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and in him ; what it was when digested . Not that his organs of perception were not accurate or retentive : on the contrary , they had all the automatic precision of first-rate machinery , and in later years he was always at the head of the class in school , and the best player , as far as personalskill went , in the field . His senses , his reactions , his memory did everything perfectly for him if he only let them alone . All the routine liturgy of knowledge , dates and conjugations , and demonstrations , registered itself early in the passionlessupper regions of his brain , to be rehearsed on occasion almostunerringly . Meantime the heart within was asleep or dreaming of something else . It remained immature even in his manhood . Yet in the midst of that profound indifference , the THE LAST PURITAN 95eye and hand could attend all the more miraculously to the stops and levers of the public world , as if lightly playing a game without a purpose . Material objects were clear enough , and material problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects : yet everything in that sphere was , as it were , made of glass , perfectlydefinite , and perfectly indigestible . His masters and friends often wondered how so much competence could exist in one so passive and so little curious . They had not pursued the methods of Fraulein Schlote . How plastic , how digestible , how easily filtered into the heart , were those German words and verses and prayers ! How readily they became a part of his rhythms and of his bent , when he sat in Fraulein 's lap , and beat time to the measure , like a master-musician leading a choir ! Once Fraulein even rumpled up his hair , which was naturally quite smooth and unobtrusive , so that he might look more like a genius . And sometimes , when he was reading or reciting and came to a hard place , she would stroke his bare legs , to help him over the difficulty , and to show that he was getting it right . One day , without any reason , he climbed up from her knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very softly and very tight for what seemed to her a long time . " But darling , " she said , smothering her emotions , " why do you do that ? " His German , and even his English , was inadequate to frame an answer , and he merely held on . " But do you ever hug your mother like that ? And of course it would be very wrong not to love her ever so much more than you love me , because she is your mother . " Somewhat slowly and absent-mindedly Oliver let go : he certainlynever hugged his mother like that . It was all rather discouraging . Irma felt this too , and never stroked his legs again , and gradually ceased to take him on her lap . " You are such a big boy now , " she would say . " You must sit up in your high chair , " and she would lock him into it with the oval shelf attached on hinges to the back , which could be swung over his head to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay his brightly illustrated Animal Alphabet from Ant to Zebra , like an open Bible . " There you are , a little angel in a pulpit ! If ever you become a pastor  --  you know my dear father was a pastor  --  that 's what you will look like preaching in a church . " 96 THE LAST PURITANA vague apprehension remained in Oliver 's mind that he was destined to be a pastor , and to be locked into a pulpit with a big book open in front of him . A pastor would always look like that and would always feel like that : because the persons he ought to love best , like his mother and God , would always be impossible to hug and it would always be wrong to hug the others . The high chair was not without a charm of its own , like walking on stilts : and confinement to that pulpit was rather cosy , so long as one 's mind was really on the book . Yet after a while for some hidden reason , that perch became uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it cross Oliver 's dutiful mind to fret or to break off . Life was essentiallysomething to he endured , something grim . There was no reasonableness in rebelling simply because for the moment things might be unpleasant . The digestive mind went on digesting , perhaps rather slowly : and the undigested objects and words would continue to stream by , strangely precise in their strangeness . And when presently the page was finished , the shelf lifted over his head , and he could climb down to terra firma , he did so without hurry , as if exercising the established rights of a freeman . One day , his pencil , which he prized because it was blue at one end and red at the other , had happened to roll under the table : and as he crawled after it on all fours , what was Fraulein'sastonishment when she beheld the perfect geometrical pattern of the straw seat printed in pink on his little bottom . " What , " she cried , " has this wicked chair been hurting my little darling ? And why has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him such a nice soft cushion to sit on ? So she shall , this very day . " But it happened to be time for luncheon , and Fraulein , still full of the subject , unsuspectingly mentioned at table the urgent need of a cushion for Oliver 's chair , and babbled on about an odd piece of pretty chintz and nice wadding from an old winterjacket with which she would manufacture it that evening , to be ready for pulpit-time the next morning . Mrs. Alden let her talk on ; but after a little pause pursed her lips and said : " I do n't think little boys ought to be brought up to sit on cushions . It is effeminate . The chair comes from the very best makers in Great Falls . I paid a particularly high price for it , and I'mTHE LAST PURITAN 97sure it must be quite right as it is  --  much cooler and healthier in summer than sitting on a stuffy cushion , which is always slippingabout and getting tumbled and making one restless . If only Oliver would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under him , he would be perfectly comfortable , and would n't need to find fault with what is provided for him . " Fraulein , intimidated , did n't dare to observe that Oliver did n't fidget and had n't found fault with anything . Mrs. Alden , being a woman of independent and intuitive mind , unhesitatingly invented the thoughts and actions to be attributed to others : and she was so confident in the truth of her divinations that she did n't hesitate to proclaim them as facts even in the presence of the persons concerned . Sometimes she hit the mark and impressed everybody : and even when she was wrong she made her assaults in so cordial and optimistic a tone , as if what she said was an acknowledged fact , which she generously accepted , that most people hesitated to take offence , or to contradict her . Selfknowledgeafter all is fallible , and the position of the insulted party is weak , defending himself against cool and smiling injustice . So Fraulein on this occasion dumbly gave up her case : did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she had meant to tie down the four corners to the legs of the chair with four sweet blue bows . But her firmly set little jaw under her snub nose told of an underlying determination to circumvent the tyrant , and spare somehow the tender skin of that innocent heroic child . And indeed , before the next lesson , she had bound together four thicknesses of blotting paper with red tape , and attached them firmly to the offending seat . Red tape and blotting paper surely were not effeminate : they suggestedthe future statesman and scholar . Mrs. Alden never went into the schoolroom , and need never discover the subterfuge : and in any case it would pass until the cold weather came , with Oliver 's fifth birthday , and he attained the dignity and the protectionof breeches . THE LAST PURITAN 99IVJr was on a first day of October , under the sign , as it were , of autumnal temperance , that Oliver had been born : at that turn of the year when the climate of New England , after stimulating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with some sudden thaw and spasmodic tropical heats , at last confirms his systematic cheerfulness by settling down to a spell of cool , clear weather . Then the sun rides low in the sky , veiled and coloured by exhalations from the damp woods , the sea , and the smoke of cities : while some early touch of frost turns the still vigorous foliage from a harsh green to patches of crimson and russet and glossy yellow . A fresher air fills the human lungs , and the jaded summer boarder returns from weary holidaymakingto hopeful business . It was also during this benign interval that Peter Alden was accustomed to revisit his family . He came usually for Oliver 's birthday , bearing some gift ; and he departed after Thanksgiving Day , before there was occasion to retract his thankfulness . In the year of Oliver 's first cloth breeches the birthday present from his father was particularly impressive , and appropriate to that manly garment : it was a pony to ride . The boy had had no pets : pigeons , and white mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were so messy : dogs and cats were a nuisance , not to be allowed beyond the servants ' quarters ; and the horses in the stable were too big and too formidable . A boy at the age of five has a twentieth-century mind : he wants only machines expertly workable ; or else living creatures as machine-like as possible , with statistical habits , to be trained and organised to team-work : something with springs and stops of its own , and immense force in reserve , but stops and springs to be controlled by his little master-ego , so that the immense foreign force may seem all his own , and may carry him sky-high . For such a child , or such an adventurous mechanic , a mere shape or material fetish , like a doll , will never do : his pets and toys must be living things , obedient , responsive forces to be coaxed and led , and to offer a constant challenge to a constant victory . His instinct98is masculine , perhaps a premonition of woman : yet he is not thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy his instinct for domination , because they share it : machines can be more exactly and more prodigiously obedient . Nor will a parent , a leader , an irresponsible power or sovereign God engage the respect of such a free agent . He wishes to be the centre of direction , if not the source of material power . Anything not exactly controllable he will despise and ignore . The great achievement will be to harness forces that seemed intractable , and to identify the good with his own material ascendency . Oliver , at the age of five , had not yet discovered the tragic error in such a philosophy , and the arrival of a pony was an excellent occasion to put the matter to a first test . Fraulein had sometimes taken him to the stable where he had respectfully admired the carriage horse in the box stall , and the cart horse loosely attached by a halter to his manger : but he had been rather frightened at their swishing tails and mouths grotesquely moving , and had been distinctly unresponsive to Fraulein 's enthusiasmabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness , and the wholesome natural smells . But to receive for his own a live pony , not higher than his rocking-horse , but with a mane like a lion , was quite another matter : and when , full to the brim already of a silent intensity , he was suddenly seized by his father and planted on the pony 's back , the experience was a revelation . Now he was not in the least afraid . Even the pleasure of sitting aloft was lost in the impulse to act . His look became earnest , he grasped the reins tightly with both fists and pressed his knees manfully against the saddle . Never had he felt such a sense of responsibility . Of course he was n't going to fall off : but the important point was not to pull the bridle too tight , so as to hurt Dumpy , and yet to pull it hard enough to make him mind . It soon became evident that the secret of control was not so much force as suggestion : and for suggestion to succeed the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be solicited and not outraged ; and on this sympathetic basis a firm and thoroughly responsible government was soon established by the child over the beast , to the latter 's apparent satisfaction , and to the very serious realisation on Oliver 's part that it was his duty to rule and that he knew how to do it. roo THE LAST PURITAN THE LAST PURITAN rorDumpy became the symbol of worlds to conquer . It was now Fraulein 's turn to find their expeditions too ambitious and to think it always time to go home . As the interest in managing Dumpy subsided  --  the lazy thing never would trot more than a few yards at a time  --  his value grew as a seat for placid observation . They could now wander far beyond the Cemetery and the Asylum , down the gentler inland slopes of High Bluff , to the farmers ' houses and bits of remaining wood , or even to the babbling upper river and the small ponds . There were cows , there were squirrels , there were ants , there were crows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not the world afford ? Home life , on the contrary , as its circle widened materially , seemed only to extend and intensify its dull tyranny . Sometimes Fraulein would take him to town in the brougham to have his hair cut or get new shoes or try on new clothes at the tailor 's . These , too , were festive excursions , because at least he might stand up in the carriage and run from one window to the other and see what was going on in the street . When they got out , he could stop to look into shop windows ; and while Fraulein was intent on choosing exactly the right articles , or taking out her purse , opening it , and paying  --  which always took a long time and much knitting of her brows , with hardly any eyebrows to them  --  he could notice other children , so oddly teasing , prodding , and chasing one another , and the fat policeman standing in the middle of the street , and the oranges and peanuts for sale at every corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this same carriagewith his mother , always to the dentist 's . It was not for nothing that Mrs. Alden was the daughter and the wife of doctors ; and while she might wisely or lazily delegate her authorityto Fraulein in almost everything else , when it came to matters of health and medical regimen , she resolutely assumed direction in person . A foreign governess could n't be trusted to feel the immense importance of physical care . Foreigners might never have heard of sleeping-porches , and might even retain a sneaking tendency to close bedroom windows at night . The first time that Fraulein knew that her pupil was being taken to the dentist 's , though he had only his first teeth and apparentlynothing the matter with them , she had innocently blurted out her surprise : as if it was n't every civilised person 's duty tohave his teeth cleaned and examined every six months . For Oliver himself these visits to the dentist were solemn occasions : not only were the operations longer and more distressing than at the barber 's , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooks , chisels , and lancets , and there were monstrouswhirling instruments like the enormously magnified legs of a spider . But first of all there was the depressing sensation of sitting still at his mother 's side in the carriage  --  the very sensation he had in later years when he sat beside her in church : for she hated restlessness and vain curiosity and would n't let him stand up and look out of the window . She said there was nothing to see . There was indeed nothing very instructive in the long round-about drive down the hill to the city ; yet there were images , there were sensations ; and sensations and images were what that young sensorium craved , without asking whether they were instructive or even beautiful . Merely to watch things flow by was excitement enough . First there were the two granite posts and the two great elms that marked the turn from their own avenue into the public road : then you passed the cemetery gate and the Asylum gate , where the trolley stopped ; and probablythere was an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switches as it turned tail and with much stamping on the gong prepared to start on the downward trip to the city . Then there were empty building lots , with great white and black signboards , announcing that they were desirableand cheap : for the hope that High Bluff would become a favourite place of residence had not outlived the last building boom , and population had spread into other suburbs . Then you were at the bottom of the hill and Patrick would loosen the brake , and begin to trot faster and more securely ; unless he had to stop at the level crossing , where the road was spanned by a long overhead sign : Look out for the Engine . Here a negro barber-shop stood on one side and a liquor saloon on the other : you were nearing civilisation : and from here on the road was lined with hoardings , vast but a little broken and shaky , from which , gigantic in size and violent in colour , Corn Flakes , Paper Collars , Sweet Caporals , and Rubber Heels demanded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places catch glimpses of lacerated fragments of a scrubby wood , littered with tin cans , torn paper , 102 THE LAST PURITANbroken bottles , and an occasional old shoe . This was some day to be the Riverside Park : for the road , on the other side , now skirted the river , reflecting the huge mills and factories on the opposite bank ; and the high smoking chimneys attested how enterprise here had outgrown the water-power that had first attracted it . At all this Oliver stared stolidly , without understanding ; but his imagination awoke when they reached the bridge , especiallythat shaky middle part of it , which could be lifted to let by the river traffic ; and here , as he grew taller , by craning his neck a little , he could just see the sparkling mill-ponds and canals , and the water gushing from under the mill-wheels , and a bit beyond , the row-boats and canoes moored in front of Murphy 's boat-house . What is there in the universe more fascinatingthan running water , and the possibility of moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible triumph ? But that bright vision gone , Oliver would sink again into his corner : the rest , as his mother truly said , was not worth looking at . At the dentist 's , however , there were at least steps to climb , bells to ring , a queer chair to sit in , and those great spiders ' legs with their quick nerves visible , whirring and whirring . These drives seemed dull to Mrs. Alden also ; for the great transformations which Great Falls had undergone in her time , though interesting to the census-taker or the real estate agent , were matters of course to her : even a little sad and discomforting , as they flooded her little world with an alien population , that did not share her traditions and did not recognise her eminence . Yet a philosopher might gladly have loitered among those scenes , to saturate his mind with the contrasts and superpositionswhich they contained . Below those new factories and that rickety bridge , which marked the foot of the ancient rapids , now canalised and hidden by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Pond ; and from this the old village green still rose pleasantly in undulating slopes , traversed in all directions by diagonal paths under the shadow of scattered elms , with a soldier 's monument in the middle . This Common was fringed by a semicircle of nondescript buildings : two or three comfortable wooden mansions of an earlier age , painted white or light yellow : two churches , one of red brick with a little domed belfry in the style of Wren , the other Gothic with a greatTHE LAST PURITAN 103sloping roof and a grey stone spire ; the old Town Hall , now a public library ; the old Court House , now a second-hand furniturestore ; and newest and freshest of all , the model High School , with a vast expanse of glass windows and a forest of ventilators on the roof : a place destined to be , a few years later , the goal of Oliver 's daily pilgrimage . In the midst of these accretions , the green shaded spaces of the Common retained an air of repose , refreshment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on a bench , apparently willing to do nothing . There were sparrows hopping and twittering . There were dead leaves whirled about , quite as in Homer 's time , by some gust of wind ; or being swept up into heaps by an aged gardener . After all , here was the heart of that noisy and restlessorganism which extraordinary circumstances had caused this quiet village to put forth , and clothe itself with , almost to the point of stifling and extinction ; yet , here the old simplicity survived , under a crust of bustle and business , of bitter enterpriseand bitter commitments . The new world began at the corner , where Main Street and Chestnut Street parted , and dividedbetween them the banks and shops and clanging electric cars of a thriving provincial city . From the same ancient centre a long tentacle had also stretched to High Bluff and to the Bumstead mansion , where three or four generations had already struggled with good and evil fortune , and with a good and bad conscience . " Mother , " Oliver said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in front of which Mrs. Murphy was sitting sewing , and holding her youngest sprawling offspring somewhat inconveniently in her lap , " why does n't she make the baby sit on the bench ? " " I do n't know , " Mrs. Alden answered without looking . " I suppose the child is too young and ca n't sit up yet . " " Oh , no ; he 's almost as big a : I am . " Mrs. Alden now involuntarily looked up , a litle irritated . But it was a settled principle with her never to show impatience . " Perhaps , " she said , as if she were speculating on her own account , " he may be sleepy , and she 's afraid he might drop off and fall into the water . " While her lips were uttering these words mechanically , Mrs. Alden could n't help becoming aware that they were nonsense ; 104 THE LAST PURITANfor that hypothetically sleepy boy would have had to roll twenty feet on a level before reaching the river . Would Oliver notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument to a higher level , and turned from physical to moral considerations ; a great resource when the facts contradict one 's convictions . " Very likely , " said Mrs. Alden , a little sadly , " very likely it 's mere stupidity . Probably that woman ca n't afford to have a separate chair at home for her little boy , such as you have in the schoolroom : and so the poor creature has got used to holding him in her lap , even when they are out of doors , and there 's plenty of room on the bench beside her . They get almost to like huddlingtogether . It 's repulsive , and so had for the little one 's health , and so uncomfortable . But ignorant people are like that . " Far , far in a dim past , as if it had been in another world or in a pre-natal condition , Oliver remembered the long-denied privilege of sitting in his mother 's lap . It had been such a refuge of safety , of softness , of vantage : you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure protection , like a king on his throne , with his faithful bodyguard many ranks deep about him : and the landscape beyond , with its messengers and its motley episodes , became the most entertaining of spectacles , where everything was unexpected and exciting yet where nothing could go wrong ; as if your mother herself had been telling you a story , and these pictures were only the illustrationsto it which painted themselves in your listening mind . But now , in the real world , where you sat alone and were going to the dentist 's , the centre seemed to be cold and only the circumferencefriendly and congenial : an untouchable world where rivers sparkled and flowed , and tugs whistled , and bright brown boats and canoes were moored together to the landing-stage , like bunches of bananas , and Mrs. Murphy sat sewing in the sunshine , and pressing her child to her broad bosom . VTHE OLD BUMSTEAD HOUSE , GREAT FALLS , CONNECTICUT , Thanksgiving Day , 1896 . MY DEAREST LITTLE SISTER ! These last days here have been glorious  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Doctor , my little Oliver 's Father , has been makingus a visit . It is better after all that a man should be at the head of a household . You know that for the most part the Doctor sits in his yacht , the Hesperus , which they say is very beautiful . How I long to see it ! Although formerly he had one even more magnificent ; only with that strange love of belittling everything which all English-speakingpeople have  --  they call it humour  --  he had named his superb pleasure-ship The Old Junk , because I believe he had fitted it up as much as possible like a boat he once sailed in up and down the Chineserivers . What must his life have been , a young man then , alone and rich , in that far country where all morality is so strange and heathen ? I dream of it for long , long hours , but I shall never know . He is most reticent ; and if I ask him something he puts me off with that cold tiresome American thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be serious sometimes and tell us , thirsting souls , the truth about something ? Lieschen dear , I think I see the reason . It is that they hate to think ! They are too busy , too tired ; or if they half form an opinion in spite of themselves , they wo n't take the trouble to express it accurately , or to defend it . They laugh at what people think , even at what they think themselves , and respect only what people do . Yes , my dear , and beneath that horrid cynical scepticism , there is something deeper still . They are afraid of the truth ! Is n't it dreadful ! I want to teach my little Oliver  --  he is such a brave child , with his silent grey eyes so clear and wide open  --  not to be afraid of the truth . Of course they are all strictly truthful here about trifles : no little lies , no fibs , no positive deceit . Just icy reticence , and hypocrisy acted out with a life-long reserve . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature , and preferring to live in harmony with the truth , rather than with what people about you think it proper to say . But I am wandering from the important point , which is the lovelyI05ro6 THE LAST PURITANfood ! You know how dry and tasteless I usually find it in this house . For two years always insipid chicken and half-raw beefsteak . Seldom veal , seldom ham , and never delicious roast pork . But oh , the change , when the Doctor is here ! He is very considerate , and never wants to interfere with Frau Alden 's arrangements ; but he brings things up from the yacht , or orders them from a caterer 's in Boston , as if they were presents , This year he has actually brought his black cook  --  a nativeof India , my dear , I have seen him !  --  not to the house , where the servants might object , but to a gentlemen 's club in town where they have coloured waiters ; and he cooks there , and brings the dishes all covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's half an hour in the electric car , and of course the hot things get cold ; and Mrs. Alden says it is all useless and troublesome and unnecessary , and that things lukewarmor re-warmed are not appetising . But the Doctor , in his quiet way , laughs it off . " You need n't eat them , my dear , " he says , " they are little extras for me , because my stomach is so diseased that it can digest nothing but poisons . " But she eats them nevertheless , and sometimes is quite mollified , laughs at herself a little , and confesses that they are excellent . The Doctor has a theory about hot and cold things which he calls his Greek philosophy , that people who require things either very hot or very cold have no palate , but only blood-vessels : they want to be cooled when they are warm and warmed when they are cold , but ca n't taste anything . And he wo n't have ice in his water or wine , as they have here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will drink them , because , he says , he wants to know what sort of tea or soup he is taking . Mrs. Alden shrugs her shoulders and thinks he is a little mad , and he takes advantage of being odd ( like Hamlet in Shakespeare ) in order to laugh at people , and especially at his wife , without offending her too much . You know she is very proud of her family ; and though the Bumsteads themselves are not very distinguished , she says her maternal grandmother was an Adams ; not one of the Adams 's of Quincy , but belonging to a branch of the family joining the Quincy branch earlier . " Yes , " the Doctor will say under his breath , " a little earlier : before Adams was spelt with an S. " This is an American joke ; at first these things had to be explained to me but now I can understand them almost unaided . And although it is a very old joke between them , Mrs. Alden always smiles a little when it comes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own expense that he has to be forgiven . And he has such tact ! He wished our cook to learn how to boil rice as he likes it , quite dry andTHE LAST PURITAN 107soft and not stuck together ; so he called on her in the kitchen  --  I was in the pantry and heard it all unobserved : what luck !  --  and said that he was never able to get buckwheat cakes , except at home , as she made them ; but that he liked them so much , with the superior refined maple syrup with which she served them , that he was going to ask her as a favour that she should teach his cook , although he was a Hindu and a little dusky , to make them as she did . One lesson would do , these Eastern people are so intelligent . And Mrs. Mullins , though she thinks it beneath her to talk to coloured people , could n't help being flattered ; and when the sly young Indian came  --  for he is not more than thirty , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare anybody  --  she said he was no black man , but more like an Italian , and that she would n't have minded actually sitting down with him to a cup of tea . And as he talked very magnificently all the time in excellent English  --  better than Mrs. Mullins ' own  --  and deftly manipulated the long spoon and the dishes of various sizes , as if he were a magician  --  she was quite mollified and bewildered ; and when he said : " Now , Mrs. Mullins , would n't you like to give the Doctor a surprise ? Suppose to-day for luncheon you give him some Indian curry such as he never tasted out of India ? " And then he proceeded to prepare everything himself , and fetched from a bag he had brought with him , the chutney and saffron and special pepper that were required . And you may be sure the way of steaming that rice remained fixed in Mrs. Mullins ' subconsciousness as if by hypnotism ; and now she could n't do it wrong even if she tried : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one yellow ; thick curry saturating the bits of mutton cut in cubes ; and a generous portion of chutney sauce , to go with it . How it tastes ! But that was only one day for luncheon : the chief feast was to-day at dinner . I did n't know at all what we were to have , because the Doctor had taken charge , saying it was a New England feast and mere Europeans could n't understand the secret of it . That was also a joke , because he said at the same time that he would take Oliver out on Dumpy , so that I might have the whole afternoon free : and you may imagine that I improved the occasion to go and have a good talk and a glass of beer , with Frau Muller . Well , dinner was served half an hour earlier , now that the days are short , so that little Oliver might come to the table , although he is only six years old . Oysters ! You will say , loathsome , slimy , slippery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But wait . Imagine first a plate full of cracked ice ; lovely smallIo8 THE LAST PURITAN THE LAST PURITAN 109silver forks like tridents to eat them with ; each oyster of the six lying in its delicately shaded mother-of-pearl shell , and not just crudely raw , as you think , but dressed with lemon juice , and a little parsley : and then , entirely to remove that horrid feeling , the Doctor will pass you a beautiful little flask , cut-glass and silver , with a liquid red pepper in it called Tabasco sauce : and two drops of it on each oyster will produce the most delicious contrast between the cold watery substance and the sharp peppery condiment . Then just a sip of old pale sherry  --  this of course also from the yacht , for at home we keep no wines  --  and then comes the hot clear mock-turtle soup , with bits of jelly-like meats and slices of hard-boiled egg ; so stimulating , so varied : and with it no ordinary soggy bread , but cheese-sticks , and fluffy , puffy biscuits like pommes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip of the sherry , or your whole glassful , if you like , because you know there is champagnecoming . And now the real surprise of the feast . No boiled meats , no roast joint : instead , on each person 's plate , my dear , one entire whole canvas-back duck , larger than a pigeon . You begin to cut it , and to the eye it may seem a little raw ; the blood oozes out ; but if you take courage and taste it  --  how marvellous ! And such accompaniments , too ; fried crisp bread-crumbs and sweet soothing currant jelly ; and fresh cool celery-salad with slightly pungent radishes mixed in ! When I exclaimed and clapped my hands , as of course I did , on seeing an entire duck served on my plate , just for me alone , Frau Alden looked at me severely : I must n't teach Oliver to make gesturesor show his feelings : gentlemen are not monkeys . But the Doctorsmiled at me , I think he was really pleased , and said : " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these birds . Bits of metal are rather unpleasant to the teeth , at least at my age , and anyhow not nutritious . Do n't think these little duck come from some pond in a farmyard ; they are sea-birds bred in the salt marshes which abound along our Atlantic coast : men have to go far out in flat-bottomed boats , and hide behind the cover of rocks or tufts of scrub and tall weeds , so as to shoot them as they fly past : and the fine spreading shot which they use is n't always easy to find or to extract afterwards . When I was younger I used to shoot them myself sometimes for sport : it was a broad primitive life , solitary yet occupied . There is something poeticalabout those vast expanses of calm water and cloudy skies , and the wild life in them . But it involved getting up before dawn , with poor food and much exposure to cold and damp ; and my rheumatism protested . I daresay the young bloods are still at it ; but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helps the poor whites in the shore villages to eke out a living , at least at this season . Heaven knows what they do for a livelihood all the rest of the year . Probably they are politicians and distil whiskey . " Dearest Lieschen , how wonderful , in the midst of luxury and refinement , with all that beautiful silver and glass on the table , and flowers and lights , and a Venetian lace table-cloth  --  for Mrs. Alden is very proud of her mahogany table-top , and never lets it be wholly covered , because it belonged to her family , and not to the Doctor  --  how wonderful to be carried away suddenly into the wild , wild world ! I seemed to feel the salt wind blowing , and the birds rising and screeching and spreading their broad hard wings ! And then the thought of those dreary back-waters of American life , those ramshacklewooden houses , those gaunt joyless women , those bitter , swearing , hard drinking men ! It is not as in our simple countryside , where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything is well-ordered and healthy and beautiful , and even festive at certain seasons , in the old human pagan and Christian way . Here all is dismal , difficult , ugly , and desolate for the poor . You must be rich here , or your humanity is frozen stiff . " And how do you like the duck , Fraulein ? " " Oh , very much ; but why is there almost nothing to eat in the wings and legs ? It seems to be all breast . " " The breast , " the Doctor replied , " is the wing-muscle ; the more a bird lives on the wing , the more its breast develops . The same thing happens to wild duck naturally which happens to those tame youths who swing clubs at the Young Men 's Christian Association : the breastmusclesdevelop enormously and leave them with spindle legs . You must remember that birds are not mammals , and the breast has n't the same function in them as in the cow . " Here Frau Alden , who has an ample bosom , blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Really ! Is n't this conversation becoming rather physical ? " The Doctor glanced at me , to see if I had any cause to blush , and saw at once that I had n't . It was the first time he had looked at me as if I were a woman and not just a governess . He went on quickly . " Fraulein wo n't mind . She belongs to a scientific nation , and knows that science is elevating . " " Yes , " I cried , " elevating and thrilling ! I hope Oliver will love sctcnce . IIo THE LAST PURITAN THE LAST PURITAN III " How is that , Oliver , " said his father , turning to the little boy who had already finished his milked toast and was looking rather sleepy . " Do you know what a quadruped is ? " No answer . " You know what a bird is , do n't you ? It hops on two legs . " " Yes , " said Oliver , still a little sullen , " it hops away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat or Dumpy , if he were livelier , would run away on four legs , would n't he ? " " Oh , yes , " Oliver replied , now almost wide awake . " Well , that 's why a cat or a dog or a horse is called a quadruped , because it runs away on four legs and not on two , like a bird or like a man . In a bird the front legs have become wings , and in us they have become arms and hands . " By this time Oliver 's eyes had become round and he was quite seriousand silent , feeling , I am sure , already the grandeur of science . But at that moment the ice-cream was brought , and a beautiful portion , complete in its caramel basket , was put before him , as before the rest of us ; and the ice-cream , for the time being , became more interesting than science . Such lovely ices , too , with green and yellow and red leaves made of candied fruit , and spun sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really good fruit here comes packed in cotton wool , as if it were a doll or a jewel . And the buds were confitures-a-surprise , my dear , so that when the thin caramel shell burst in your mouth , it startled and electrified you by suddenly discharging its secret drop of the sweetest and strongest cordial ! I have n't time  --  it is I a.m.l  --  to tell you of the mince-pies , always made for Thanksgiving ; but ours were quite special little ones , one for each person , and served with rum flaming all round them , as in an English plum-pudding . We shall have plum-pudding of course for Christmas , and I am already enjoying the taste of it in anticipation , with its rich solid sugar sauce ! But those unexpected drops of liqueur , what a pleasure ! Not even Goethe when his soul cried , Verweile doch . . . But I ca n't possibly leave out the champagne which , alas ! we sha' n't have for Christmas because the Doctor will then be far away , basking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste Sekt at our Herr Burgermeister'sson 's wedding ; but this is French champagne , much more delicate and potent and transporting : a sip or two quite enough to lift you into the sphere of the Ideal , with all lovers and poets and mystics like Goethe and Dante and Omar Khayyam and Solomon  --  only of course it was n't Solomon  --  in his passionate Song of Songs , with itsdepths of marvellous meanings . How miraculously the spirit is freed from the body and the whole negative , cruel , earthly side of things melts away , and the wonders of the Arabian Nights seem after all the most natural , innocent , glorious of realities ! But I am leaving you open-mouthed , Lieschen dear , waiting for the last course . It was nuts and dates and figs and raisins and pears and oranges and hot-house grapes . Of course I could n't taste everything , but I never can let dates go by , because I think of the Bedouins in the deserts of Arabia , who eat almost nothing else ; and it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth , that I share that simple , intense , religious life of theirs , all endless journeys through the wide burning sands , and love under the full moon . I am going to say something dreadful , dearest sister , but I feel it , and though it be blasphemy one should always say what one feels . I can no longer cry with Goethe , Verweile doch . No : such loitering is unworthy of the German spirit ! We must not cling to anything achieved , but stretch out our eager hands for ever to the Beyond . And I wo n't say , towards " Something Higher . " I wo n't climb up any ladder set up for me beforehand , with rungs all numbered higher and higher , like degreesin the thermometer ! What is that but a remnant of mediaeval metaphysics ? The free , bold , pure German genius can not be confined to such a single narrow path . It will forge its way out of Itself in any direction , in all directions , into the infinite , scorning all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment by living , molestedby no facts , recognising no conditions , but creating always the next step by Its untrammelled sudden inspiration . Nature is a prison . As for me , give me Chaos ! Oh , I must stop . It is two in the morning . How sleepy and seedy I shall be to-morrow ! Perhaps that last too beautiful green mint in cracked ice , with its exquisite little glass , cut like an emerald of a thousand facets , was too much for my sober judgment and I have been writing Unsinn ! How rich is experience in this wonderful world of ours , even if experience for you and me is not always so overwhelmingas it has been to-day for your ever loving and still hopefulIRMA . P. S. There is no one at present , but I am only twenty-two . VITHE golden age of Dumpy , alas , could not last for ever . Oliver 's legs grew longer ; he began to love speed , and preferredhis bicycle ; and he was also a hit concerned about his personal dignity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy little beast ; it was like riding a toy elephant on wheels . The demon of self-consciousness had got into Oliver early , never to be exorcised . Dumpy was a nice old thing , but he could n't be allowed to make his master ridiculous . One was responsible , in the first place , for oneself , and must always choose what was best , even at the cost of outgrowing one 's old feelings and one 's old friends . Thus without knowing it  --  although Fraulein may have dropped some hints to that effect  --  Oliver anticipated the maxims of Goethe , and sacrificed his heart to his self-development . Dumpy on his side , as if consenting to the sacrifice , opportunelywent lame , and finally had to be shot ; and Mrs. Alden , who never spoke of death , said it had been thought wiser for Dumpy not to remain with them . In spite of the coldness and distance between Peter Alden and his wifq , with deep distrust on her part and perfect indifference on his , they agreed in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education of Oliver . At first , during his early boyhood , he should be brought up at home , like a young prince , though without courtiers . In this way he could be thoroughly well grounded in his studies  --  something impossible in a modern school  --  and could acquire the speech and manners of a gentleman . But later on he must be sent to school ; not for the sake of his lessons , but for moral and social reasons . The social reason plainly could not be snobbery : there was no older family in America and few richer than the Aldens , and even the Bumsteadswere leading people in their own estimation . On the contrary , social relations were necessary in order to obliterate as far as possible the sense and the appearance of this immense superiority . It was imperative that Oliver should learn to live and to think democratically ; that he should discover what AmericanTHE LAST PURITAN 113life was , not by inspection from his own point of view , like a supercilious foreigner , but by participation in it during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home in his country . He must begin by sharing spontaneously the habits and enthusiasms of his generation ; otherwise he would never be able to influence them for the better . According to his mother 's maximsit was only in order to contribute to the national life  --  of course by elevating it  --  that Oliver existed at all . His father was less certain about the purposes of existence , either in Oliver or in mankind ; but he agreed that anyone destined to live in Americaneeded to acquire the protective colouring that would enable him to move confidently in that medium and escape destruction or at least unmitigated misery . Peter Alden himself , in spite of the humour which covered for him a multitude of sins , both in himself and in others , and in spite of having been thoroughly initiated in his youth into a particular native circle , had found himself nevertheless a waif in his own country as well as in the rest of the world . That particular circle had been too narrow and old-fashioned ; and in slipping out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national events and national sentiment . Not , as he said to himself , with a sort of mocking modesty , that either he or his country had lost much by that divorce : but Oliver , being also his mother 's son , might be expected to have more stamina , greater gifts , a more aggressive conscience , and a thicker skin . Some day , therefore , Oliver must be sent to school ; but the day was put off as long as possible , for the sake of his studies . He was a remarkably good pupil , somewhat calm , as if he had heard all these things before , but evenly absorbent , and evenly retentive . Irma , all love and zeal , had no , difficulty in emptying into him her store of knowledge in German and English literature , in history and even in the classics . When it came to the natural sciences and mathematics the little lady was hard pressed to keep a bit ahead of her ward and appear to know what she was expected to teach him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacitly dropped , and he systematically took the lead , while she became simply a pace-maker and sympathetic comrade in his career of discovery . Oliver soon found , as he afterward used to put it , that there was a sunny and a shady side to the road of knowledge . TheII2114 THE LAST PURITANsunny side was the study of nature , where all exploration was joyful , and free from evil passion and prejudice . The same was true of mathematics which , if not so sunny as geography or astronomy or natural history , at least was pure from human taint . You were honestly challenged by your problem , and could work your way honestly forward until you came to an honest solution or an honest difficulty . Only non-human subjects were fit for the human mind . They alone were open , friendly and rewarding . Unfortunately the human subjects had to be studied too : and here  --  in history , languages , literature , not to speak of religion  --  all was accidental and perverse . Perhaps story-telling , just for amusement , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it ; although Oliver himself had never cared much for tales and poetry and things supposed to be funny : he had been less bored than most children when let alone , and less pleased when prodded . But to tell stories and pass them off for the truth  --  what an extraordinary outrage ! The histories and theories which people had composed in their heads did not appeal to him as visions , as incitements to the imagination , which is the way in which they really appeal to the humanists who cultivate them : and not caring for them as fictions , it never crossed his mind to mistake them for truths . On the contrary , he instinctively hated them for trespassing on that ground ; they were counterfeits ; they were rendered malignant by the very fact that they had a subject-matter more or less real , which they dared to caricature and diminish and dress up in the motley of particular minds . Yet this subject-matter itself was a sorry affair : a chaos of barbarous and ignorant nations , struggling for a wretched existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human world was so horrible to the human mind , that it could be made to look at all decent and interesting only by ignoring one half the facts , and putting a false front on the other half . Hence all that brood of fables . But this flattering office of poetry and elegance did not redeem them in Oliver 's eyes : they were only " frills " ; and all such beautificationsbelonged to the shady side of knowledge . In his boyhood , though words and ideas were lacking to express it , this puritan disdain of human weakness and of humangenius was at work silently within him . It caused him to do his languages and history in a perfunctory way , with a cerTHELAST PURITAN 115tam inward and growing estrangement . He remembered the facts in the books easily , and the meanings of words , and the rules of grammar ; but his mastery of these matters was a little sardonic , as if he resented that such things should have to be remembered at all . He found escape from that absurdity not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , but above all in bodily exercise . This was destined to be his sovereign medicine and sheet-anchor throughout his short life . A fit body might not make a fit mind , might even induce a certain mental sleepiness ; but at least it would keep the mind sane . In a world where so little was sure , there was comfort in feeling sure of your nerves , your muscles , and your digestion . Moreover , exercise in the open brought Oliver into a genuine communion with nature , such as he never found either in religionor in poetry : the confident active sympathy of man with things larger than himself , and with a universal reptilian intelligencewhich was not thought , but adaptation , unison , and momentum . That groping labour which had produced the trees , the rivers , the meadows , which was piling up and dissolving the clouds , seemed then to engage his inmost being in its meshes and to turn him for the moment into the gladdest , the most perfect , yet the most dependent of creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , feeling at the same time the immense promise of a thousand other perfectionssleeping in the womb of nature , into which the strong soul of this moment must presently return . Nevertheless , this escape , this private wordless religion , soon bred its own conventions and became compulsory and imprisoningin its turn . To go for a single day without two hours of vigorous outdoor exercise was now out of the question . That would have been as improper and shameful as to lie in bed all the morning out of laziness , or to go unwashed , or to wear soiled linen . It would have meant physical restlessness and discomfort indoors , and the most horrible sensual moodiness in the inner man . Yet in the nondescript changeful weather of New England it was only occasionally possible to play lawn tennis with Fraulein , and seldom tempting , in that seared suburbanlandscape , to take long walks like an old man merely for the sake of walking . Nor was it often steadily cold enough for much skating or tobogganing . A sandy golf-links indeedI16 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , and unattractive ; and the country was too hilly for bicycling with patience and a sense of freedom . What better , thought Dr. Alden , when all these difficulties were set before him by the combined eloquence of his family , what better than that Dumpy should have a successor ? Was n't Mr. Charley Deboyse , with whom he sometimes quaffed drinks and exchanged stories at the Somerset Club , on the point of sellinghis polo-ponies , some of which , like their master , were no longer quite keen and limber enough for so brisk a sport ? And would n't one of these ponies , well-trained , light-footed , but not too , frisky , be just the thing for Oliver ? " Polo ! " cried Mrs. Alden . " Oh ! " and her tone expressed the extreme of pain and of disapproval . Polo was an extravagant , dangerous foreign game , lit only for desperately idle rich people trying to be fashionable . Besides , Mr. Charley Deboyse drank ; and she would n't like Oliver to have a horse that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , she did approve of what she called horseback riding : and it was true that Oliver was n't to play polo himself , or drink , or ever see Mr. Charley Deboyse . In the end , the shock having passed , she consented broad-mindedly to waive her objections and her misgivings : only stipulating that polo should never be mentioned in connection with the new pony , and that it should not be Oliver 's pony exclusively , but simply an extra horse in the stable , which might be put into a light cart , as well as ridden . A pony-cart , she instantlyperceived , would be a real convenience . It would relieve Patrick and leave him more time for useful work ; because in good weather she might drive herself into town in the cart instead of going in the heavy coupe or the pretentious victoria , both of which involved a coachman . Hating the presence of servants in general , she particularly suffered at the thought of coachmen , and of those dirty , idle , smoking , sauntering , and surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives waiting and waiting in the cab-stands of cities . What could one expect of such men 's morals whose very business was to do nothing most of the time ? Without Patrick , it would be much nicer going shopping , or to the post-office ; and by taking Irma she would n't even have to get out at the shops ; and she would be breathing the wholesome morning air , and at the same time accomplishingso much that had to be done in such a great householdas hers . That trip to town in the morning , which would n't come every day , would n't give nearly enough exercise to a wellfedhorse , used to hard work : for she confessed that from the point of view of the ponies alone , polo might be a good thing . Oliver might therefore perfectly well take the pony out again in the afternoon for a short ride . But it was most important that the boy should not get into the habit of thinking that everything in this world was provided exclusively for him and for his pleasure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially for an only child , with the example of his father too , who lived so much aloof , and was n't really so ill as never to be able to do anything for other people . She was thankful that , as a girl , she had had so much responsibility thrown upon her , in having to provide everything for her father and her young brothers : she might not otherwise have learned to be thoroughly public spirited and unselfish , and to find a rich life in the service of others . Oliver , too , if possible , must be made to feel that , if he was given the opportunity to ride , it was not for his idle pleasure , or for show , but only for his health , so that he might be able later to carry on his life-work better , and to have a greater influence for good in the world . Young Oliver accepted the new pony  --  which was a beautifulcreature  --  with a momentary flush of pleasure , yet silently , as if he felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was getting only what he deserved to possess . Everything kept challenging him , as it were , to walk on higher and higher stilts , and forcing him to make a success of a ticklish and , at bottom , a needless business . There was satisfaction , of course , in doing the job handsomely , and he was not in the least afraid : he knew he could do it : he was proud of the pony and of himself mounted on it so airily , and he was almost grateful  --  vaguely , to circumstances , to God , hardly definitely to his father ; but at the same time in a not unpleasant way he was sobered , he was deepened . There was a quiet melancholy in privilege . One must accept privilege , because it brought a chance of greater achievements : but happiness , pure joy , would have come rather in having no privileges and being lost in the moving crowd . When a flock of birds took the air in a great wheeling caravan , only the birds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enviable . He might be asked why118 THE LAST PURITAN THE LAST PURITAN I19he chose that particular direction , or veered as he did , and why he startled and summoned and hypnotised the rest to follow . What answers could that bird give ? There must be leaders , or there would be no grandeur in life ; but there was something tragic , something ominous , in being chosen to lead . Could that leading bird be said to be living for others ? Was he not rather imposing himself upon them , and thereby turning what might have been his free life into a responsible thing ? Was it their fault if they made a guide of him and blindly followed whereeverhe seemed so impetuously bent on going ? And if he misledthem , were n't his native innocence and courage turned into guilt ? As for those others , for whose sake the strange burdens of existence were apparently to be borne , they were principally his mother , Friiulein , and the occasional apparition of Miss Letitia Lamb or his father in the offing . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official protectors : none of them were in need of his assistance ; he was n't doing his lessons or taking his exercise for their supposed benefit . They all seemed to think , on the contrary , that they were continually and unselfishly benefiting him , and living for his sake . It was later , and to the world in general , that he was expected to repay all these attentions . Others meant that whole quarrelsome kettle of human beings in the distance , and their unknown posterity . How was he , poor child , to discover what he ought to help those unborn multitudes to become ? Was he to trust the prophetic sympathy of his mother and the Unitarian minister as to what the good of others would be ? Would those others like it any better than he liked what his mother and the Unitarian minister said would be good for him ? He felt in his growing bones that he was being oppressed , that there was something horribly unnecessary and unrighteous in the arrangements of this world . He was often told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well : and how was he to discharge that responsibility ? By endeavouring to lift others to his own level , so that they might be as responsible and as unhappy as himself ? All those preachments , coupled as he could feel with a profound helplessness in the preachers , or with a satisfied ignorance and desperate bluff , fell upon his ears like so much rain beating against the window-panes . One must n't quarrel with the weather ; one must be cheerful and go out and take one 's exercise just the same : one must grow strong and tolerant and indomitable within oneself , and let the winds and the people bluster . His true counsellors spoke to him without words . They were the woods through which he rode alone , letting his horse pick his way through the unkempt scrubby undergrowth , and amusinghimself by dodging or whipping aside the twigs and the hanging branches . Not one tree here lived for others : not one insect , not one crawling thing , questioned its native impulse to thrive . Was not the only good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as undefiled and determined and completeas possible , and to let others too live as they liked ? He would n't crush them , he would n't torture them , he would even help them out of a trap into which they might have fallen , if their distress was obvious , and he could befriend them without compromising his own integrity . He could succour ; but he could n't abet or instigate all this swarming blindness of existence . Once in the race , you had to take your chances , and nobody could make you run faster than your legs would carry you . Nor could everybody win . He would win , because he could : yet it was curious how little pleasure he found in the foretaste of victory . In the woods even the tallest trees , that had fought their way victoriously to the upper light and air , were cramped and distorted ; and their meagre crowns were often half-withered and bald . Was he to be like that ? No : he could get out of the woods , into the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main road , he would pat the strong curved neck of his pony , or the smooth flank ; and he would catch an understanding answer to his congratulations in the lighter step of the beast , or in his quivering nostrils . How pleasant and how various were the allies which a truly clear and masterful will could find in the world , and marshal against one 's inevitable enemies ! To surrender to those enemies , or to compromise with them , was not only to tarnish one 's own soul , but to create new and more intimateconflicts and hasten towards dissolution . Never mind enemies . Rider and horse could strengthen and gladden each other in their spontaneous common career , forgetting who was servant and who was master , disdaining enemies , and disdaining death . And there were other amenities in his boyish life , and other120 THE LAST PURITANsilent communications . He had learned to ride : he must also learn to swim and to row . And who more fitted to initiate him into these midsummer sports than Mr. Denis Murphy , who kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were over , but he had had them , and for those in the know he remained a distinguished personage . Fifteen years earlier he had been sculling champion of the world . Such fame , though it may lead in the end to but a humble place in human society , never quite loses its glamour in the imagination of contemporary sportsmen : and the presence of that superannuated hero in the neighbourhood had not escaped Peter Alden . Whenever he came up from his yacht in the launch it was at Murphy 's landing-stagethat he put in ; and for years the Doctor and the boatmanhad exchanged prognostications about the weather , or on the prospects of elections ; and many a little bill had been paid and many a good cigar given , to predispose Mr. Murphy in the rich man 's favour . When the proposal finally was made , to take young Oliver out on the water , and give him a hint or two about rowing , no business , however important , was allowed to stand in the way : and Oliver soon had his boating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own shell and oars . Many an afternoon in summer , during his teens , was spent under Mr. Murphy 's protection : for it became a matternot merely of barely learning to row or to swim , but of expertness in these arts , and even a little practice in boxing was thrown into the bargain . Mr. Murphy was proud of his young pupil : and Oliver not only applied himself diligently to doing well  --  which for him was a matter of course  --  but he felt a sort of confidence in this simple man such as people of his own class did n't inspire . Bodily skill was something unmistakable : the proofs of it were material , and so were the forces with which you had to count , material and sure ; and even your own conceit or shyness could be easily corrected by the event . You were classed by your performance , not by your opinion or by anybody else 's . That was such a relief . At home all was a matter of discussing opinions , and feeling bitterly how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have no opinions . If you asked him what he thought of this , or thought of that , he simply grinned , and changed the subject . But he could tell you how things were made , and how things were done , and why thingsTHE LAST PURITAN 12rhappened  --  that is , within the boatman 's sphere . He was the first master Oliver had known . Often the man and the boy would make long excursions together , for the most part in silence . It was not only possible to take a dip from the landing-stage at the boat-house , but it was possible to row , or even to sail , up to the northern end of the Mill Pond , a great artificial widening of the river above Great Falls , produced by the mill-dams ; and there , in the silvan seclusion and silence of a sheltered cove , a lesson in swimming had a special charm . Mr. Murphy was a native of Ireland , where he had spent his youth : he felt that his pupil was a young gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from irrelevant talk in the boy 's presence . Perhaps he felt also the greenness and coolness and glassiness of the scene , as somehow haunted by higher powers , and sacred to youth . Oliver by that time had become an idyllic stripling , slender in body and tender in mind , quiet , attentive , and courageous ; always careful to swim or to row correctly , as Mr. Murphy had explained scientifically that one should row or swim , even if the oars sometimes grew rather heavy and the water rather cold . Yet the arts learned so scrupulously seemed somehow sad arts : they scarcely penetrated to the dumb potentialities of Oliver 's being , which remained unmoved , as if waiting for something wholly different to call them forth . And the quietness of the boy , beneath all his dutiful diligence and evident powers , inducedsilence in the good man also : as if Chiron , the Centaur , in the presence of the young Achilles , had refrained from snorting . Afterwards Denis Murphy would say to his wife , " That young kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't live to be old . The likes of him is n't made for this world . Pity he 's being brought up a heathen . " VIIMEANTIME , on the completion of Oliver 's fifteenth year , it had been agreed that he should go to school . In any other household equally fastidious the choice of a school might have been a terribleproblem , but in this case the question solved itself without difficulty . There was only one school that Oliver could go to . For Mrs. Alden disapproved of all boarding-schools on principle : . they removed boys at the most critical age from the sacred influencesof home and mother , and they were hot-beds of snobbery , rowdiness , cruelty and immorality . To make up for this real wickedness they dressed up those young ruffians on Sundaywhite surplices and made them file two by two with joined hands into choir , and sing sentimental anthems ; so that their only idea of something better than brutality might be to become little angels in a perpetual choral service in heaven . And what was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best nonentities , copied the fashion-plates in tailors ' windows , married rich women , and were null intellectually , null morally , and null politically . " Ilurray , hurray , " Peter would murmur , admiring the convictionwith which his wife could turn into virtuous invectives that secret jealousy which she felt towards people more fashionable than herself . And he concurred in the issue . Boarding-schools being excluded , Oliver must be sent to the Great Falls High School , which was the only day school within reach . Certainly Peter felt some regret that his exceptional son should have to be educated in an obscure provincial establishment , among common boys , and under mediocre teachers : yet was any alternative really more attractive ? Were not all schools provincial in spirit , and all schoolboys barbarians , and all schoolmasters mediocre ? Or if there were exceptions might they not be found at Great Falls as well as elsewhere ? In his own boyhood the influence of Mr. Mark Lowe had been a happy accident . The crucial turn in everything must be left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only going to school in order to learn to liveTHE LAST PURITAN 123among strangers , to play games , to have comrades , and to find his own level in a nondescript world . For this purpose  --  the only use of schools  --  any school would do . In any school Oliver might acquire knowledge of men and boys , and test and develophis character . In this way Peter Alden , who laughed at his wife 's unconscioushypocrisy , succeeded in deceiving himself a little about his own motives . He had abdicated all formal responsibility for Oliver 's education , and let his wife bring the boy up as she chose . It had been a kind of sarcastic gallantry towards her superior intelligence and knowledge of life , and it had relieved him of the enormous difficulty of making up his own mind . Yet his conscience , at bottom , remained uneasy . Would n't something entirely different have been infinitely better ? In reality , as schools go , the High School at Great Falls , Connecticut , had much to recommend it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the latest and most expensive contrivances . Prosperity in this corner of New England had not banished conservativism : the Demos aspiredto be cultured and refined . There was an Art Museum , and the Public Library , though the gift of Carnegie , was handsomelysupported by the city council . Yet all these great opportunities ( as they were styled ) for self-education went with a certain survival of restraint . This model schoolhouse , ultra-modernin every other respect , had two separate entrances and two school yards , for boys and for girls , on strictly opposite sides of the edifice , and a severe brick wall , running like a vast bulk-head through the whole height and breadth of it , separated the two sexes ; nor was it rumoured that any Pyramus and Thisbe had ever pierced a hole in it for exchanging kisses . Moreover , there was a special classical division reserved for boys intending to go to college : and all the teachers in this division , as well as the Headmaster , were men : a lucky circumstance , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had lived too long under the exclusive influence of women . Refinement , sentiment , moral intensity were all very well , but they should not be made the fulcrum of your universe , or that universe would come toppling down on your head . The great , the trusty educator of mankind was matter : and matter , in ladies ' minds , was entirely veiled in a mist of words . And not in ladies ' mindsI22124 THE LAST PURITANonly . Most schoolmasters were people who had failed in the world , or who feared to fail in it : they knew matter only by the terror which they felt of it : yet even that indirect acknowledgmentwas better than a bland innocence and an unchecked indulgencein fabulation . Oliver would feel , however lop-sided his new masters might be , that they had one foot on terra firma . To sit in front of a yellow wooden desk , screwed to the floor , in a yellow wooden chair , screwed to the floor likewise and scientifically hollowed out to fit one 's standardised person , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were eight such chairs and eight such desks in a row , and five or six rows of them , all alike , was somehow reassuring . Nothing was likely to happen anywhere in this new world except that which happenedregularly everywhere and to everybody . Alden being alphabetically the first name in the class list , Oliver was placed in a corner scat in the back row , between two large windows ; and without turning round or showing any undue curiosity , he could see most of the boys ' faces , with the full sunlight upon them . They looked to him at first like so many small editions of Mr. Denis Murphy , and he rather liked them for that : not as if they were real people , such as the people at home , but boys in some picture-book or tale of adventure : simple , rough , gleeful , and together producing a certain rumble and vibration of herded life , like horses in their stalls or pigeons in a dovecot . He soon found , when it came to standing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seemed to him a very small boys ' game  --  that he had nothing in particular to say to them , or they to him . Their brogue too was something like Mr. Murphy 's , only shriller , uglier , and more aggressive . He soon learned their dialect and slang , but it always remained a foreign language to him , as did common American speech in general . He did n't hate it ; sometimes it made him laugh ; it all seemed to him like a turn on the variety stage , meant to be funny , and really droll , though it might become too constant and tiresome . His own natural speech was that of ladies and clergymen . His mother , Fraulein Schlote and Miss Letitia Lamb each had her own accent and intonation ; but they had much the same vocabularyand were all equally punctilious and self-conscious in their way of speaking . They were always asking how this or that word ought to be pronounced , or whether this or that phrase was THE LAST PURITAN 125good English . Fraulein 's Anglo-German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver and accustomed him from childhood up to certain polite and idiomatic British phrases , of which he felt the rich savour ; and then there was the authority of his father , to whom the three women would appealin their grammatical perplexities , because after all he was a Bostonian , had spent his life travelling , and knew so many other languages . Oliver , in spite of his tendency to believe that whatever was natural in himself was right , was rather disturbed and uncertain on this subject . He could n't be content , in speech any more than in anything else , with what was wrong or inferior , or second best ; yet it was most puzzling to decide what the absolutely best was , and so hard , even then , to live up to it . Language , for him , did n't belong to the sunny side of life . It was one of those human troubles in which the curse of original sin , and of Babel , most surely appeared . It would be too much to affirm that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some subjects , indeed , his accomplishments already went beyond the demands of his new teachers ; but he was beginning Greek and French ; and even in other matters the authors read or the methods of treatment were often new to him , and enlightening . Moreover , there was the schoolroom atmosphere of laziness , mischief , mockery , and howlers : it supplied a fresh and crude human settingfor all this imposed learning . Above all , there was the personalityof the teachers . The school mind seemed to regard them as a sort of policemen to be circumvented as much as possible , and jeered at : but to Oliver they looked rather like poor monstersembarrassed by their pachyderms , with perhaps a spark of natural boyish soul still smouldering within . Particularly was this the case with the sarcastic wizened little man who taught American history and literature in a high quavering voice , with a bitter incisive emphasis on one or two words in every sentence as if he were driving a long hard nail into the coffin of some detested fallacy . Cyrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or politician in his native Vermont , had his opinionsbeen less trenchant and unpopular ; and even as a schoolteacherhis position would not have been secure , if the headmasterand the City Council had heard all the asides and all the comments with which he peppered his instruction . His joy , 126 THE LAST PURITAN as far as he dared , was to vilify all distinguished men . Franklin had written indecent verses : Washington  --  who had enormous hands and feet  --  had married Dame Martha for her money ; Emerson served up Goethe 's philosophy in ice-water . Not that Mr. Cyrus P. Whittle was without enthusiasm and a secret religious zeal . Not only was America the biggest thing on earth , but it was soon going to wipe out everything else : and in the delirious dazzling joy of that consummation , he forgot to ask what would happen aferwards . Ile gloried in the momentum of sheer process , in the mounting wave of events ; but minds and their purposes were only the foam of the breaking crest ; and he took an ironical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was credited to the efforts of great and good men , really happened against their will and expectation . The great and good men were in themselves no better or wiser than the failures : they merely happened to be on the winning side . They had done something that had survived and counted , whereas the failures  --  and Cyrus Paul Whittle thought of himself  --  had done just as much , only it disappeared and did n't count . Never- theless  --  and here the dry flame of Calvinistic illumination would light up the man 's eyes for a moment  --  you were not to be discouraged . Providence did wonderful things through un- worthy instruments . You might be fearless and shrewd and without an atom of deference for anybody on God 's earth , and yet you might be full of faith , hope and charity . These sentiments sank imperceptibly into Oliver 's mind , with- out awakening his attention ; they were not incongruous with his own temperament ; and they merged also with that herd- instinct , that sense that you must swim with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which now became dominant in him . It was not living for others ; it was not doing good . Those were just words to cover the desire of busy-bodies to manage other people , and make the world over according to their own fancy . This was something natural , genuine , spontaneous , like sympathy with nature at large . It was that very sympathy con- centrated and intensified within the human circle . It was living with others , letting others live in you , being carried along by their impulse , adopting their interests ; and all this not because you found their ways right or reasonable or beautiful or con- genial , but just because those ways , here and now , were the ways of life and the actions afoot ; and there was no real choice open to you to live otherwise or to live better . So with the same docility , the same pluck , and the same sadnesswith which he had done his lessons at home , and taken his exercise , he now began to do at school everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the autumn term , was to play football . Eleven boys , with some substitutes , were to be chosen out of a class of forty ; and it was evident that Oliver must offer to play , being the tallest and , as it soon appeared , the strongest and quickest of the lot . But he was new to the game and had to endure at first the mortificationsof a beginner . All was not pleasure in the first scrimmages , being pushed and hustled and crushed and sworn at : but Oliver was long-suffering , not afraid of pain , resolute , and attentive , and his pride was concerned to seem hardier than he was , and not to mind bruises and dirt . He continued to hate these things , but he learned to endure them . The tactics of the game were soon mastered : the worst of it was the malodorous rough crowdingand fighting . He had to force himself to " scrap " ; those boxing lessons of Mr. Murphy 's were a help in many an extremity ; only he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also the art  --  impossible to Oliver  --  of opportunely breaking as well as invoking the rules . However , with a little practice , the air gradually cleared . Opportunities came of showing his special abilities . Soon , in spite of his weight , he was removed from the line , and placed at half and finally at full back , which remained his normal position so long as he played football . It was a vast relief to find himself in most of the action , and in all the intervals and breathing spaces , whenever the whistle sounded , well out in the open , alone , with a wide field of vision to watch and to traverse . Refreshed and masterful at that point of vantage , he could easily nerve himself to buck the line and fight hard at close quarters , when that was required ; and when the ball came to him in a comparatively clear field , he was entirely in his element running and kicking . His long legs , his clear eye , a sort of self-possession which was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in a drop-kick : and in these respects he established at once a local reputation . Indeed , before the end of his first season he was moved from his class team to the school eleven , where he was128 THE LAST PURITANthe youngest boy : and this unprecedented honour established him at once as a school hero . Murmurs that might otherwise have gathered force , to the effect that he was a sissy or a snob or a coward , were entirely silenced : the more that in a first encounter with the rowdy gang  --  which he soon learned to distinguishfrom the decent and neutral elements  --  his unexpected quickness in the manly art had discouraged open hostility . His contemporaries continued to eye him askance , as a swell and a highbrow  --  the juster word prig was not in their dictionary  --  but they suspended their ill-will , and waited for developments . The leaders of the school , with whenn he now associated , approved of him , and the teachers also : and as in his studies he was invariably at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was useless and that he was heir-apparent to all the honours of the school . In his last year he would have to be elected captain in foot hall and field sports : only baseball , which he did n't play , would remain open to his rivals . His looks and manners came to be generally admired : he was the hero of all the smaller boys in the school : and the whispering groups pocketed their jealousy and democratic intolerance and decided to back him up . There was something diffident and apologetic about him which , at close quarters , turned away wrath . He was fair and civil to everybody , had no favourites , no clique , and indeed seemed to make no friends . At times the curve of his mouth grew serious and almost bitter ; and a certain listlessness appeared in his attitude when he was not engaged in making some express effort . All his lessons and sports seemed to be taken up as duties , and executed unswervingly , as if to get rid of them as quickly and thoroughly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; his life now had absolutely no leisure in it ; but at least there was a silent moment of peace as each duty  --  each enemy  --  was despatched in turn . Perhaps in that flight of birds which Oliver had watched and wondered at in other days , the leader was not really a bold spirit trusting to his own initiative and hypnotising the flock to followhim in his deliberate gyrations . Perhaps the leader was the blindest , the most dependent of the swarm , pecked into taking wing before the others , and then pressed and chased and driven by a thousand hissing cries and fierce glances whipping him on . Perhaps those majestic sweeps of his , and those sudden dropsTHE LAST PURITAN 129and turns which seemed so joyously capricious , were really helplesseffects , desperate escapes , in an induced somnambulism and a universal persecution . Well , this sort of servitude was enviedby all the world : at least it was a crowned slavery , and not intolerable . Why not be gladly the creature of a universal will , and taste in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there might be nothing to choose between seeming to commandand seeming to obey . If others envied him , he secretly envied them ; would have liked to be simple like them , spontaneousand unhampered . Against cheating , dirt , and foul languagehe maintained his prejudices , and did not hesitate to show them ; but in other respects his ambition was to be like everybody else . Externals were burdens : the fewer and plainer the better . He had a gold watch , one of his father 's presents , and was willing to carry it , because it kept good time and allowed him to be always punctual ; but he discarded the gold chain , and tied the watch to the lapel of his coat with a black thong intended for a bootlace . He noticed that many of the boys wore no shirt but only a sweater , perhaps with a jacket over it . He would have loved to imitate them : collars were such a hindrance and cuffs such a bother . His negative temperament , his impatientyoung reason kept asking : What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear suddenly at home without a shirt . Even a tie was imperative : yet what an absurdity that was ! A strip of flimsy silk , gaudily coloured , throttling you all your life for no reason . He always dressed for dinner , in grey trousers with pumps and a black coat : and his clean starched shirt and his black tie seemed to him appropriate then , because there could n't help being something stiff about a family dinner : it was a good deal like going to church . But when it was a question of doing something , and doing it well , why dress up inconveniently ? He could make a shy beginning of reform , as far as he thought he could stick to it . " But Oliver ! " cried his mother one morning at breakfast , " where is your waistcoat ? " " Upstairs . Hanging in the closet . " " Why have n't you put it on ? " " Nobody at school wears a vest  --  they call it a vest  --  except the teachers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable to go about like that . Your father130 THE LAST PURITANalways wears a waistcoat , and so did your uncles when they were boys . In the heat of summer , I could understand it : but now , in October , you 'll catch your death of cold . " " When it gets cold I 'll wear a pullover . " " Besides , you will need the pockets . " Oliver smiled . His mother had twice shifted her ground , from respectability to health , and from health to convenience . He felt that his case was won ; but he could n't resist the temptation to rub it in a little . " I have four outside pockets my jacket and three inside ; three in my trousers ; and six more in had weather when I 'm obliged to wear an overcoat . Sixteen pockets . Is n't that enough ? " Mrs. Alden was silent . Did n't she manage with a single pocket , or rather with none , but only a portable reticule , to be forgotten on every table and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press his advantage . Asceticism offended the polite world , and wearing a sweater instead of a shirt , except in sporting hours , was a privilege allowed only to the poor . VIII " I CA N'T make out , " observed Mrs. Alden , as she and FrauleinIrma sat fanning themselves in the north porch , " what is the matter with Oliver . Not a word has he uttered all through lunch . He 's so strong physically , why should he be so terribly bitter and languid ? I 'm afraid it 's something inherited from his father : weakness of moral fibre and a tendency to melancholia . These two years at school have been so splendid for him , keeping his mind occupied , and giving him plenty of outdoor exercisein their school games : and with always keeping at the head of his class and winning all those prizes , . one would think he ought to be more cheerful and lively , and more like other boys of his age . When my brothers went to that same school  --  and it was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they were perfectly irrepressible . They would come home to snatch a meal , and rush off at once on all their silly schoolboy affairs . And in summer they would go camping in the woods : but Oliver absolutely refuses to go again to Dr. Brown 's camp at Skeater 's Pond : calls it godforsaken  --  what a word to use about his own minister 's summer home , and Mr. Brown so liberal and hearty and broad-minded , nobody would take him for a clergymanat all ! Yet instead of that happy wild life with other boys , Oliver insists on staying at home all summer and reading . I 'm sure it may be very good for his mind , but is it wise ? His uncles may have made more noise , and been less considerate , but at least they never moped . Oliver is so critical of everything , so dissatisfied and disdainful . One would think he had been crushed by some terrible disappointment , I suppose the doctors would say he was passing a climacteric  --  trying to becomea young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three years ago . Is n't he almost seventeen ? What a loss for us all that my dear father could n't have been spared a little longer . He would have helped so much in this matter .

You do n't know how splendidly he pulled Dr. Alden himself out of all his difficulties and cotn-131132 THE LAST PURITANpletely cured him  --  at least as far as a man of that age could be cured at all . " " But who better , " Irma cried full of innocent conviction , " who better to advise Oliver than his own father ? If Dr. Alden only knew , would n't he came at once and tell us what had better be done ? " " It is n't as if Oliver were really ill , " Mrs. Alden retorted . " It 's only moodiness . " " I know he feels the heat terribly , " Irma went on , " he is tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular lessons , with all the effort and responsibility about ; athletics , because he felt it would be such a disappointment for the school if at the interscholasticgames he did n't Will the ttvu hundred and forty yards dash , and the hurdles and " " How can you remember those silly words ? It does all seem so childish ! " and Mrs. Alden rocked herself in her chair , half amused , half impatient . " But it 's his life , Mrs. Alden . I try to follow his life , to share it , to understand what makes him happy or unhappy . And I know the trouble lie took , training for all the sports in which lie thought he had a fair chance of winning , although some of them were new to him , or he did n't like them particularly . And how wonderful that he should win in them , just as he had foreseen ! Not a touch of conceit or even of pleasure in it all , just firmness . If I can do it , ' he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no use trying to think of amusements for him : they do n't amuse him . Only when we read something very very beautiful , a very high thought , he seems at last to come to life , as if that were what he had always been waiting to hear , and had never heard . Not poetry that is merely beautiful : he does n't care for Schiller or Heine or for Shakespeare or Shelley . It must n't be beauty of words or of enthusiasm : it must be pure truth , even if sometimes sad . I was reading Schopenhauer to him yesterday  --  you know Schopenhauer is a most wonderful idealist and lovely writer , only , alas , a confirmed pessimist and horrid about women  --  but of course in reading to Oliver I skip all those wicked Mephisto passages , which I have marked beforehand with a cross . Well , when I read how everything becomes beautifuland as it were enchanted when we suspend our Will and see the whole world merely as an Idea , Oliver stopped me , madeTHE LAST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go on until he had repeated it himself three times in the eloquent German , and knew it perfectly by heart . He is starving for great thoughts , Mrs. Alden , his soul ca n't live without great thoughts . We poor imperfect people , and all our muddled human affairs , are a great burden to him , a foreign world . Not that he is in the least arrogant or unkind , or dislikes humble people . On the contrary , it 's people with pretensions that he ca n't endure . Did n't he want to ask Tom Piper , the apothecary 's son , to lunch the other day , not at all because he cares particularly for the boy , but just out of kindness ? And did n't you notice how flushed and disgusted he was , though he said nothing , when he found that it could n't be , because the Pipers are shopkeepers ? No : it 's rather a trial to poor Oliver to be pursued by affection . I can see how I annoy him sometimes by being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German . And only just now , when Tom Piper came up to ask for Oliver and invite him to a picnic , and I said that Oliver was out , probably gone in his canoe to lie under the trees in the Upper Mill-Pond , I could n't help adding quite frankly that Tom had better not ask Oliver to the picnic . Oliver was very tired , quite worn out by hard work and the heat , and it was better for him to have a complete rest , yet I knew that if asked he might feel that he ought to accept , so as not to seem sulky , or ill-natured , although it could n't at presentbe really a pleasure or at all good for him . I could see that Tom Piper , who seems to be a nice modest lad , was terribly disappointed , having come up the long hill for nothing in this dreadful heat , pushing his bicycle ; and it 's evident that he adores Oliver ; yet he thanked me in a hesitating way for telling him the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver or to intrude , but had hoped they might go canoeing sometimes during the vacation , because in the school terms Oliver was always too busy to see much of any of the boys . It 's a strange puzzle , because Oliver needs more friends , more sympathy , and yet the friends he makes and all their attentions seem to mean little to him , except more weight of obligation . Perhaps some great change would set him right . What a pity that we ca n't consultDr . Alden . " " It would n't be impossible to consult him , " said Mrs. Alden , a little impressed by the earnestness with which the good IrmaTHE LAST PURITAN134considered the matter . " He happens to be in Boston , kept there by delays in getting his yacht ready  --  brand new , and already in need of expensive repairs . His summer 's trip has been spoilt : all because of that foolish insistence on building a new yacht when the Hesperus was quite good enough until last year : and why not now ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's no use warning him . He knows he is a victim , and he laughs at it ! It amuses him to see all those idle men in the yacht making merry with his money , and he is almost grateful to them for letting him prep in and have some of the fun . Heaven knows if the new boat is at all seaworthy  --  they say it 's a fancy ship and not like anyone else 's  --  and likely to sink with them all one of these days in mid-ocean . But it 's his folly : and if I asked him to come and see Oliver , and he found that the boy is merely out of sorts and overgrown and has nothing really to complain of , he might blame me for making a fuss and interfering with his liberty . " " But I have heard him so often praising you for not making a fuss and for not interfering ! " " Write to him yourself then , if you like  --  I have no objection  --  and tell him why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . That wo n't oblige Dr. Alden to come or to do anything unless he chooses . " Peter Alden disliked writing letters . One had so often to invent the sentiments one was obliged to express : and those conventional beginnings and endings annoyed him , and made him feel like a fool . He answered , whenever possible , by telegraph : and the next day Irma received a long despatch , suggestingthat she and Oliver should join him in Boston . A few days ' cruise in Massachusetts Bay , while they tried the new engines , might do Oliver good . IXHOTEL VICTORIA , BOSTON , DEAREST LITTLE LIESCIIENI Ply IO , 1907 . How surprised you must be to see your dear exiled sister dating her letter from Boston ! Yes , I am freed ! The poor , lonely little bird has escaped from her gilded cage ! I am alone in this world-city ! ! ! How did it happen ? Have I quarrelled with Frau Alden and am I an outcastbeggar ? Have I eloped with my young lover  --  alas , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No : nothing so upsetting . The Herr Doktor has simply asked my Oliver to join him in his pleasureyacht , and as Oliver  --  so his father and mother think  --  is too young to travel alone , I have come to Boston with my dear pupil . Of course nominally he is n't my pupil any longer , since for two years he has been going to school ; but in fact we study and read together just as in the old happy days , especially during his vacations . At first the thought that he was to be sent to school was terrible , and I had to offer to leave and go back to Germany , or perhaps to Milwaukee or Chicago or some strange place , and try to become an ordinary German school-teacher . But they said no : they needed me ; and I was n't to be Fraulein or a governessany more , but Irma and one of the family . How the tears ran clown my cheeks , and how I had to kiss Frau Alden , and Oliver too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor have I since . What ? Never kissed your little Oliver even at first , when he was four years old ? No : it was forbidden . In this country it is wrong to kiss your children ! Yet you see they do n't grow up quite heartless on that account ; perhaps quite the contrary . You have read in the papers about our terrible heat-wave . In New York people are sleeping half-naked on the roofs or in the parks , workmen are collapsing and children dying . Even at High Bluff the thin shade of the pines gave little shelter : the sand and the dust of pine-needles under foot radiated heat like an oven . Oliver could go swimming : but it is n't possible to keep one 's head always under water : he said his eyes ached with the glare , and the dusty trip to the river and back more than cancelled any relief he might have got from the bath . Here in Boston , too , it is oppressively warm ; but yesterday there was a whiff of east wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAST PURITANYou may ask , why did n't Frau Alden come with her son herself ? Ah , that is a strange mania of hers : leaving home , for her , is out of the question . How often I suggested , in the first years , that we might go for a few weeks to the seaside or in the winter to Washington or to New York . Oliver could still have had his lessons with me as usual in the morning ; in the afternoon we could have seen the sights , and in the evening , after putting him to bed , we could have gone to the Opera ! But no , Frau Alden would n't hear of it . The journey would be so fatiguing , the hotels so crowded and noisy , the strange hired beds so creepy and unpleasant , the fo ( xl so messy , too rich , perhapspoisonous , and the other people so loud and vulgar . In summer the heat everywhere was as had as at home , where we had greater comfort and more space , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salt winds might blow up the river for many miles  --  and the Bumstead House was on such a high hill that really it was n't worth while to go to the mountains . That is what she says : but I know that she thinks also that , at a fashionable watering - place , or in a great city , she might n't seem very well dressed , and might be taken for my mother . For  --  would you believe it ?  --  though she has so much money , she hates shopping ! She gets on with one or two old frocks , always black or navy blue , that can be covered up almost completely , when she goes out , with a " handsome " tailor-made coat and furs , or a silk mantle in summer : and once she has on her pearl earrings and necklacewith those fine lace ruffles that are now worn down the front with an open neck , she feels that she is well enough dressed to impress Great Falls , where everybody knows she is rich and above criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same dove-coloured gown , with white lace , until it is in shreds , and then she has another made as much like the old one as possible . This Priscilla costume she says is right for the wife of an Alden : and it keeps her from having to think , like a foolish Back Fisch , what she shall put on . Oliver is just like his mother in this respect . He never wants more than just enough clothes for use , and always the same things in the same colours . What a wicked malicious goddess Fortune is , that cruelly gives the money to the wrong people ! If you and I were only rich , how happy we should be ! And here are these very rich people  --  they do n't know themselves how rich , because the Herr Doktor will never tell , and perhapsis a bit vague about it in his own mind  --  people who ought to have everything , and they have nothing ! A handsome woman , little past fifty , who does n't mind looking old , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening party or deck herself out in splendid clothes , but wants simply to sit at home , quiet and stately , and to feel perfect ! A Quaker queen , her husband once called her , and she was frightfully pleased . They both like retirement and monotony as if they were ninety . Is it because they feel if they tried to do anything else , they would n't do it very well ? So they simply exchange a few stupid commonplacesat home over their roast chicken and bread pudding , and sit for an hour afterwards in the drawing-room pretending to read , looking every few minutes at the clock and suppressing a yawn , becauseFrau Alden does n't think it right to go to bed before half-past nine . You ought , though , to see my evening house-dresses ! One is skyblue and the other peach-colour . I cut and sewed them both myself on the sewing machine , and you ca n't imagine how sweet I look in them ! The blue one has black velvet bows , and I wear a red rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( we have n't a real garden , only grass and the pine-woods beyond ) for the sake of the aesthetic colour-harmony . The peach-coloured dress is all trimmed with autumn leaves applique , which I cut out of remnants of rich brocade , left over from making a work-bag for Frau Alden 's Christmas present ; and the stitching all round each leaf , and the stems , are in real gold thread ! It is much admired ; and with this gown , when I can get them , I wear white flowers . I still play my old Chopin pieces sometimes , or sing one of my old dear Schumann songs , but I have n't any time for practice . Lately , however , I have made a great discovery . Oliver has a beautiful tenor voice ! I am giving him singing lessons ; but he does n't like singing , as he says , " to show off . " Only once in church , where the congregationis supposed to join in singing the hymn , he let out his voice a little . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adeste Fideles , but to such poor English words  --  and he could easily run up and down those scales in his full natural note , without either thinning out and squealing at the top or gasping and becoming voiceless at the bottom , as happens to most of us . People at once began to look round slyly , and then glance at one another with a benevolent smile , so that I could almost hear them thinking  --  " What a fine voice that young Oliver Alden has , and how enthusiastically he joins in the singing . Is he going to be a clergyman ? " Because you know , except the paid quartet , nobody here more than hums the psalm-tunes . Naturally , as soon as Oliver noticed that he was attracting attention , he stopped , 138 THE LAST PURITANand has never sung in church since . Sometimes , when we are in the marble summerhouse at the very top of the Bluff , he will really sing something : but there we have n't a piano , and we ca n't make much progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't do him justice , because there is a sweetness and manliness in his ways which ca n't be photographed , but you will see how distinguished he looks with his large clear eyes and pale hair , so tall and slender and unassuming . The young sons of the Grand Duke of Weimar , whom we once saw , you remember , at the railway station , looked a little like him . But what am I writing about ? I have such a garrulous mind , and you want to hear about my wonderful journey . Yet it does n't matter if I have been reminiscing a bit , because I have the whole evening before me , and nothing to do , alone in this strange city ! Why did n't it occur to them that I too might be too young to travel alone ? I am scarcely yet thirty four and people take me for twenty-five . From behind , they say I look eighteen . Yet they leave me unprotected , as if there was no danger , in a hotel full of men ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed with them in that splendid yacht , out in the great wild ocean ? I low happy and thrilled I should have been , the only woman on board ! I hinted , but it was no use . Nobody wanted me . Well , on arriving in Boston , Oliver and I went to the hotel on Beacon I fill , where the Herr Doktor always stays . He lived very near there when a boy , with a mysterious older brother who leads a hermit life there still , but whom the Doctor never sees . Yet in an uncanny way he loves to haunt the old places , turn the familiar corners , and go to the same long-established shops , though now the best hotels are in quite a different quarter . So when the Doctor and Oliver left and went to the yacht , I moved here , where the waiters are white  --  they were black at that other hotel , which takes away my appetite for a moment , though it soon comes back again . The Victoria is in the residentialregion more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I seen ? Oh , so many things : the Public Library , and the Ludovisi Throne , and Mrs. Gardner 's Venetian palace ; and I might have gone also to Faneuil Hall and the Old North Church and the Bunker Hill Monument ; but it 's so warm , and my time has all been taken up shopping . I have n't bought very much , but oh , the gorgeous things I have looked at ! With these new loose fashions , home-made dresses will fit perfectly ; but I have got a winter coat  --  half price on account of the heat  --  and two new hats , and some lovely linen . YouTHE LAST PURITAN 139will say where are all my savings going and what shall I live on when I am an old maid ? But no : my savings are intact , because the Herr Doktor gave me a cheque for aoo dollars , and my travelling expenses will hardly be more than 5o ; so I have a little margin for pins ! I have also been to the dentist because while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is old , and the one here is young and a German and nicelookingand does n't hurt so much . But he is married . Unfortunately at this season there are no great artists playing at the theatres , and no good concerts : but of course I go every day to the cinema , and gloat on it . Love at such close quarters ! It almost seems as if it was myself that is being kissed . Too much of this , I feel , might not be good for me ; but Oliver is returning in a few days , and then all your dear sister'sErlebnisse will have become , alas , but an Erinnerung !
