VOLUME 160 FEBRUARY 1930 Harpers 01/4ffazine DJOMBE RIVER A STORY IN TWO PARTS ? PART BY JOHN W. VANDERCOOK T HE concession bungalow stood on the crest of a low hill which rose above the common level of the woods , so from the long verandah Totton could look westward across forty miles of unbroken forest . Only at rare intervals did the higher branches of some monster tree vary the smooth surface of the jungle roof . In the shadows of late afternoon and when the gray rains beat down , the panorama was like a dark and undulant meadow-land . Half a mile below the hill Djombe River ran between towering walls of verdure , and around a bend upstream snarled down a steep cascade . Djombe River had decided the selection of the concession . In the roadless and sparsely peopled land it was the one highway . On its changes with the seasons depended every incident of life . In that colossal , voiceless , waiting world Djombe alone had mood and living force . Never for an hour could one forget or disregard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Djombe 's waters borne on every wind . There were no white settlements nearer than the port of Molala two hundred and fifty miles away , a hard , twelve-days ' foot-journey through the jungle . Except for a few natives who lived within the limits of the huge timber grant over which he ruled , Totton saw no one from one year 's end to the next . But he had been a woodsman always , in Michigan , in Bolivia , in Siam , and at last in the West African Gaboon ; and an isolation that for another man would have held endless terror was for him a not unfriendly commonplace . Totton had lived alone on the hill for eight years before the work on the concession grew too considerable for him to cope with himself . At his request the company had then sent out Eugene Bryce to act as his assistant . Twenty-five years ' difference in age and experience kept them from deep intimacy . But for a year they had lived together Copyright , 1830 , by Harper &; Brothers . AU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of rain , and then worked side by side for the long months of unremitting sun . Totton came on to the verandah and , with hands deep in the pockets of his faded khaki trousers , looked out under the ragged , overhanging thatch . The long drought had broken in a thunderous rain that streamed down from a lowering sky all the early afternoon , but now , at sunset , the piling clouds were rumbling away southward . The temperature had dropped twenty degrees and the jungle below him , shining gold and green amid the flowing shadows of the sunset , seemed to stir with renewed vitality . Grass clumps in the yard bent and whispered in a fragrant wind . Totton walked down the moist clay path to a patent rain gauge which stood on a post near the hibiscus hedge . He looked at the indicator and nodded when the reading confirmed his guess . He flung the water on the ground and carefully readjusted the iron cups . He lifted his head and listened attentively . Djombe River , he knew from long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of dusk always gave curious clarity to sounds , but the distant roar of Djombe Falls was surely louder than it had been in the morning . . . . He 'd better , he reflected , send young Gene down both banks to see that none of the squared timbers were too close to flood-line . It was a nuisance when they were carried away . Behind him the squat mass of the bungalow was already dark . Someone came on the porch with a lantern . " That you , Gene ? " Totton called . " Sure thing ! " " You 'd better tell Aloki to put the net over the table . That rain 'll bring out all the bugs to-night . " Bryce hung the lantern on a hook and came down the steps . " I 've already told him , Jeff . How much did it rain ? " " I figure it about an inch . Maybe a little less . " " I did n't think it was as much as that . I suppose , then , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was just going to tell you . " They fell silent , together watched the dwindling , roseate torches in the west . Totton was tall , broad-shouldered and wirily built . He carried his fifty-one years with casual ease . Bryce was shorter , stouter , and twenty-five . His skin had not yet darkened from the equatorial sun . Aloki , their negro servant , came out to the porch , trailing a quantity of white mosquito bar . Bryce groped in a breast pocket for cigarettes , took one and lighted it . He nodded over his shoulder . " Robinson Crusoe notched a stick , but I can tell time from that net thing . I 've been here just a year . Remember the night I set fire to it with a butt ? " He waved his cigarette . " You should n't smoke , Gene , " Tot-ton said soberly . " Save your money instead . " Bryce laughed but found no adequate reply . Totton nodded . " All right . All right . Do as you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Let 's get inside . " They walked slowly toward the house . A sickle moon had shown above the horizon , and the top of the forest was painted in tarnished silver radiance . A faint clatter of dishes from the cookhouse behind the bungalow , the distant roar of the falls , and the faint shrilling of cicadas in the wood were the only sounds in all their world . They stopped at the foot of the three board steps . Bryce flipped his cigarette away . It made an are of tiny flame and vanished . " All very pretty , Jeff , but how have you stood it ? " " You 're restless because this job is n't your last . It is mine . " " Rot ! " Totton shook his head . " Do n't say that . It is . " Bryce 's face lighted . " Oh , I get you . Well , that 's a good ambition . " " It 's mine . I 'm tired . I 've had thirty years of the tropics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to see some people . " " Some women , hall ? " Totton eonside d . " I do n't think so . Not especiaiy . Not when you get as old as I. " Gene took him affectionately by the arm . " Glad to hear that , Grandpa ! You 'll be safe to have around the house then if my girl comes out . " Bare feet padded softly along the boards and stopped behind them . Jeff turned . " Chop ready ? " " Chop ready , massa . " Aloki disappeared into the dim interior of the house . The net hung at the corner of the porch , The homemade wooden table with its plates of steaming soup , the two straight chairs , and the shaded lamp were inside . As they finished each course they put the dirty dishes on the floor , and Aloki slid fresh courses under the net to them . They said little until the meal was over . There was rarely very much to say . When the boy began to dear away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupation of the evening . Days on the concession began by morning starlight , so the after-supper hours were not formidable . Bryce reappeared with a tin writing box . Totton , elbows on table and the fingers of his left hand tangled in his sandy hair , leafed through the pages of a heavy ledger , compared it with a smaller book , made occasional notations . Bryce broke a long silence . " Listen , Jeff . " He leaned back in his chair . Totton 's eyes lifted at once and he struggled to impart a look of friendly interest to his impassive face . A year with the younger man had given him an unhappy sense of his own failure as a companion . He felt his taciturnity , the accumulated speechlessness of the solitary years that loomed behind him had withered all intimate , important speech . He tried to think of something kind to say , failed , and kept silent . The affairs of the younger man did not interest him . They were so remote and effected him so little . Bryce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a crack about my girl coming out ? I was n't altogether kidding . Maybe she will . " He stroked his round chin . " I 've just been reading her letters over " ? he indicated a pile of worn envelopes on the table ? " and maybe I better tell you about it . " Totton lodged a brown forefinger as place-marker in the book before him . " Go ahead . " " I do n't want to bore you with my own personal affairs , but I 've done something that you ought to know about . . . I do n't know as you 'll remember . . . I must have told you something about her . . . Anyway , Marion and I 've known each other about all our lives , but we were n't engaged or anything till I got out of Forestry School at Syracuse . I worked then for a while , you know , for the State Park Commission and lived at home . " " You 've asked her out here ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give me a chance . Her father , old Doctor Crawley , is a little queer . Marion 's mother died when she was a little girl , and she 's sort of taken care of him all her life . So when we got engaged we did n't tell anybody . We both knew we could n't marry or anything till her old man died .. . " Well , " Geue put his elbows on the table and shielded his eyes from the lamp , " Well , a few months ago I got to thinking . Suppose Crawley checked out now  --  what would she do ? She hardly knows anybody but me ; and I bet you Crawley 's never saved any money . So I wrote her a letter and told her if anything happened  --  I put it that way , understand ? ? she was to cable me and come out here . . . . You 'd like her , I think . She 's had such a rotten life any fellow 'd be sorry for her . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , no . " Bryce 's round , faintly girlish face lifted and he leaned hack . He fumbled in his shirt pocket for a handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his throat . There was no longer any wind , and the night was hot . " When do you figure the runner from Molala will be here ? " Totton stroked the hollow of one cheek with a rigid forefinger . " Tomorrow or next day , I guess . Unless the river holds him up . Why ? " " Maybe there 's a letter from Marion . Last one , eight weeks ago , she said the doctor was pretty bad . And the mails are so slow anything may happen . " Bryce looked appealingly across the table . " Listen , will it be all right , Jeff ? With you , I mean ? I should have said something long ago , I suppose . " Totton carefully dosed his two ledgers and laid one on the other . " I could n't think of anything righter . " He cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you know me well enough . . . " He rose stiffly to his feet , keeping his head bent to avoid contact with the net . " We can talk about it some more when you get your next letter . Good night . " " Thanks , Jeff , I 'm going to sit up a little while longer . " Totton groped for the bottom of the mosquito bar and stooped under . The boards of the verandah creaked as he walked away . Gene idly finished his cigarette and ground it out in a dirty saucer . His young , pudgy hands hovered undecidedly over the pile of letters and then fell into his lap . He knew everything in them . There was no point in going over the same ground all over again . He pursed his lips to whistle , after a few notes tapered to a halt . The sound of his own voice suddenly let into his consciousness again that vast , pervading voice that never ceased . Djombe River far away in the darkness seemed to fill the solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings . .. The jungle night closed in on him like a huge and sweaty hand . With timorous fingers he gathered hh things , took up the lamp and went into the house to bed . Aloki , who lived in a tiny native settlement behind the hill , had a tin alarm clock which went off at five . Coming to the doorway of his hut , he blew three braying notes on a greasy buffalo horn , and the two white men at the bungalow , hearing it , awoke . At five-thirty Aloki brought coffee , fried yams , and bread to the verandah table , and the two men ate . Totton broke the silence . " Look here , Gene . That messenger will probably show up sometime this morning , and you 'll want to see your mail right away . Why do n't you cut those small mahoganies above the falls ? Then Aloki can run down and tell you when the boy comes . I 'll make fast downstream . No use in your going so far . " " Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out with a ragged cork helmet on his head . His heavy boots clattered down the steps and crunched the earth of the path . In a moment he had gone down the hill . Behind the bungalow the sun was rising and the darkness swiftly brightened to an orange glow . Bryce lighted a second cigarette and called for more coffee . It would seem strange , be reflected , to have Marion at the bungalow . If things should work out that way . He ran his fingers through his wispy yellow hair . Golly , it would seem funny . Aloki brought the coffee in a crackled zinc pot streaked with wood smoke . He poured it and went away . Bryce leaned over to drink , and the warm steam rose into his face . He sneezed slightly , and his eyes dimmed . He kept his head bent . His lips trembled . There was no getting round it , the DJOMBE RIVER tfi9 year at the bungalow had been pretty bad . . . with no fun , no girls , no one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 course . . . . Gene looked out into the clear morning . There was n't a finer man alive than Jeff , but . . . but  --  an idea came to him . But Jeff had everything in order . He knew just what he was going to do . Maybe that was the great difference between them , the thing that kept them apart . Bryce finished his coffee , found his helmet , and walked slowly along the narrow forest trail toward the falls . The jungle was so dense he could not see Djombe River until he thrust aside the giant ferns and grasses . But the sound of the rush and wash of the water where the swollen flood bent over black stones was so compelling that unconsciously he quickened his pace . One always seemed to come upon Djombe River suddenly , so gigantic was the snarl and shock of it . With lips parted and vaguely frightened eyes , he gazed at the sweeping yellow torrent between the high , still walls of green . He laughed ruefully . Djombe River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shivering , sleepy group of negroes in dirty loin cloths , were waiting for him in the gloomy shadows near the river bank . Shapeless dark figures in the dark , they sat quiet until he had passed them , then rose and followed . At this point Djombe River narrowed , and a trough-shaped bridge of woven vines swung high above the current . The structure was suspended from the branches of trees by myriad extensions of the liana ropes . One climbed up to it by a rough ladder of exposed roots . His hands holding the loose , sheerly sloping sides , Totton crossed until he stood above midstream . The negroes behind him , silent and unquestioning , stopped when he did , and the creaking 1 swing of the bridge gradually subsided . ' At this hour the river , catching the reflection of the dawn , ran like molten gold . Absently , Totton tore off a stripof withered bark and let it zigzag down . For an instant it seemed to hover reluctantly , then was seized and swirled away . His gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight gesture of his head , as if in friendly affirmation . Old Djombe knew its business . There was n't any stopping Djombe . That even the weariest river Winds somewhere safe to sea . . The savor of the unspoken words lingered with a kind of fragrance in his mouth . He grinned slightly at the poem 's irrelevance . There was n't much weary about Djombe River , not up here in middle course . . .. Well , he was in mid-course , too . Fifty-one was nothing . If Djombe River 's destination was the sea , so it was his . . . the sea and the lands beyond it . They 'd worked together pretty well , and the partnership might as well go on farther . . . down to the sea . It would n't be much longer . A check-up of accounts the night before had shown that . There was nearly enough saved to get away . Enough really to start life on after thirty years of saving , waiting . He squared his shoulders smilingly , staggered to balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trails all radiated from the river , none followed it ; so to save time they kept along the bank , chopping through an entanglement of high grass , brambles , and stunted palms . Totton kept a little ahead , hacking viciously with a machete at tripping vines . As the sun rose the jungle steamed ; by ten the heat had blanketed the land with utter stillness . They saw a sleeping python wrapped in the branches of a sapling , ignored it , and kept on . Once a gorilla jumped screaming from concealment and flung away across a clearing into a bamboo brake . Sweat poured down Totton 's cheeks , his shirt grew clammy , his boots squshed with water . He was panting , and one forearm bore a long , red , oozing scratch . Yet be was filled with a sensation of immense well-being . He hoped Gene 's girl did come out , he thought . Be kind of interesting . He seized a vine overhead with one arm , with a grunt swung himself high into the air and safe across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ! He 'd like to see any youngster do better than that ! They reached the first of the clearings where the squared logs were piled . Djombe River had already crept a dozen feet up the sloping bank . Jeff swung his boot through the lapping shallows and a fan of silver water rainbowed in the sun . He smiled with grim friendliness . What a fierce old bastard of a river it was ! Never let you forget it , never . It was fun to see who 'd win . Totton returned to Bungalow Hill -- Lola the natives called it  --  in midafternoon two days later . Bryce , to his mild surprise , came hurrying down the yard . He called out when they were still twenty feet apart : " She 's coming , Jeff ! . . . I guess I had a mental wave or something . " His tone changed with sudden concern . " You look tired , old boy , have hard going ? " His hand hovered to take Totton 's arm , then dropped ashamedly to his side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat on the top step , stretched out his muddy legs , and leaned back on his elbows . Bryce stood facing him . " Get your letter ? " " Yes . " He had lost eagerness . " Got a letter three weeks old and a cable seven weeks old . And , believe me , not any too soon , either of ' em , I got to start for Molala to-morrow first thing , Jeff . I ought to have started yesterday , but I did n't know where I could locate you . " " Get the logs down ? " Bryce stroked his hair carefully back from his forehead . " I got some of them , Jeff . But I 've been kind of busy since I got the letters . I 've been packing and  --  good Lord , any boss 'll give a fellow a day off to get married ! " Totton nodded , eyes on his boots . " Sure . " Bryce fidgeted . " I 'll have to take that falls gang as carriers down and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll only take me about a month both ways . You can get on , ca n't you ? " Totton nodded again . " How do you figure a month ? You mean she 's on her way now ? Right now ? " Gene went into the bungalow and came out with the despatch box . He sat on the top step and took out a cable form . " Look at this . " Totton took it . " Am coming SS Fernand Vaz thank you Marion " it read . Curious to say " Thank you " in a cable . " The letter , " Bryce lifted a fat envelope , " got to Molala later , but she sent it long before , of course . Funny we should have figured it out so close . " He stopped , gazing abstractedly into the shimmering brightness of the afternoon . " Weil , anyway , her old man had been buried a week when my letter got there . Passed out from a hemorrhage in his head somewhere . Shc says , " he wiggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just at the right minute . She 'd been to see their lawyer , and she 'd found there was n't any money . She wrote to say she 'd take me up . " There was a pause . Totton still considered his boots . Bryce , dampened , got to his feet . " Well , as near as I can figure it out , the Fernand Vaz gets in in about two weeks . I 'll just about catch it if I start to-morrow . Then we 'll come straight hack here . " He stopped . The faint roar of the falls seemed to fill the pause insistently . " Wish to God she 'd picked another time of year . That river 's getting pretty high . " Totton roused himself . " I guess you can make it . . . . " He craned his bead around to look up into Bryce 's face . " Look here , Gene . " He slapped the boarding lightly with his palm . " Sit down another minute . Tell you what I 'll do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the other day I said this was my last job ? That I was planning to quit ? Well , I 've figured the money even closer and I 'm settled in my mind now I 'm leaving the end of the next Long Dries . . . . What I mean is , you can have my job . The pay 's a little better , and you two ought to get on fine . " He hesitated . " That 's all the wedding present I 'll be able to give you . You know why . I 'm quit-ting . " Bryce began to stutter his thanks . " Sure . . If you 're going in the house tell Aoki I want a hot bath . " They stood in the dewy darkness near the hedge . The carriers were already well ahead along the trail . The two men shook hands . " Any errands , Jeff ? " " Nothing I can think of . Give my regards to Judge Morin when you see him . You 'd better let him marry you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So long . " Bryce reached Molala at dusk the twelfth day from Lolilt . The slovenly French traders and some officials of the port were already gathering on the latticed concrete terrace of the Hotel Grand . The pounding of a hidden donkey engine that supplied current to the festoons of electric bulbs mingled with the clink of glasses and the hum of voices . Bryce , footsore , soggy with sweat and the violent rain of the last afternoon , surveyed the scene with a vague smile of anticipation . He found the manager and was given a bleak , pink-kalsomined room under the tin roof . In an hour , shaved , bathed , and dressed in a suit of trunk-wrinkled whites , he came down and stood hesitant on the last step . The narrow open terrace , the bare bulbs , the faded people , the unsure , hurrying negro waiters , and behind all the looming shadow of the equatorial dark gave him a sense of deep excitement . He sought , self-consciously , for a familiar face . A loud , unctuously rounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a stocky figure disengaging itself from a confusion of chairs about a table . It was Jeff 's friend Morin , Judge of the Molala Cireonseription . They shook hands . Bryce was swept into the circle and , while Morin 's introductions alternated confusedly between French and English , he eyed the group with furtive curiosity . The men , apparently , were officials ; the two fat women with sticky powder on their throats were obviously wives . The resolute looking blonde girl on his left , with the high cheek bones , red lips , and appraising eyes , he could n't quite place . He took the chair someone scraped forward and examined her through the corner of his eye . Morin caught the look . " Mademoiselle Nelly , Monsieur Bryce , " he explained in a voice audible the length of the caf ? , " you do not know , has been proposed for a ribbon of the Legion ? " " That so ? " The others paused expectantly . " For distinguished colonial service . She has kept more men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile undamaged , flicked Morin 's cheek with a soiled handkerchief and spat a swift French sentence at him . The group laughed . A hatchet-faced young man leaned forward . " Monsieur , you have come from the interior ? Have the rains begun ? " Bryce nodded . " Yes , sir . They 're early this year . I 've never seen Djomb6 quite so high this time before . " The questioner nodded and relaxed . Judge Morin explained again . " Monsieur is the Chief of the Marine . " The conversation flooded back into the more familiar tongue and left Gene stranded . In a moment the caf ? boy brought a bottle of White Horse and a tall tumbler of ice . He poured and drank slowly to cover his awkwardness . After a whole year of no one but Jeff it made him clumsy-handed to be with strangers . He became conscious that the girl beside him was eyeing him . Favorably , he felt . He turned . " I spik English , " she whispered . Bryce bent nearer , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swell blonde ! He says , " she nodded with an air of tolerant proprietorship toward Morin , " that for one year you have been in the boosh ? So ? " Bryce agreed , bracing his shoulders a little . She somehow made him seem romantic . Mademoiselle Nelly leaned across him and sloshed his glass full . Her shoulder touched his . " How hard it must be for a fine American boy all alone for one year ? " Her hard blue eyes glistened , calculating . " It is , sort of . " Morin was in full career and the rest were silently attentive . The girl put her hand on Gene 's arm to silence him . She listened . Occasionally her fingers tensed intimately . Bryce , once more quarantined , attained the bottom of the immense tumbler of whiskey . A fellow , he told himself elaborately , had to be fit to get through a drink like that . Morin finished and said to Gene in English , " I am telling them about our friend Jeff . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . That he has sacrificed all , women , pleasure , everything , that he may one day live . How relentlessly  --  how shall I say it ? ? he has postponed life . It is true , is it not ? Yes ? " Morin 's voice had leveled , was streaked with somber envy . " I guess that 's so . " Bryce 's head was swimming . They smiled at him and went on with their talk . The girl edged her chair closer . Her white-stockinged , muscular leg touched his . " You stay in Molala a long time ? " He looked at her , striving to make each glance conquering . His eyes felt hot . " Not so long . I just came down to meet the mail boat , then I 'm going right back . I sort of have to hurry home , now the river 's rising . The trail keeps on crossing it . . . . I 'm meeting a . . a fellow , " he added . He blinked . Why had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " The Fernand Vae ? It comes tomorrow morning ! I am soo sorry , " Miss Nelly murmured . Her head was so close he could feel her warm breath . Her reddened lips moved stealthily , with infinite suggestion . He gaped at her , recovered himself , and they began to talk together in low tones . A platter of sandwiches appeared , and Bryce ate with such stumbling greediness they laughed at him . Now and then , like a rhyme , the words " Marion , mailboat , to-morrow " would bubble through his mind , and with a petulant thrust he would put the matter away . There was plenty of time for that . The hours waned . A phonograph played and a half-dozen couples danced between the tables , feet scraping sandily on the cement . Nelly had a fierce ardor when she danced . She alone among the women on the floor did not sweat greasily on forehead , upper lip , and in a slow rivulet down the groove between her breasts . She told Gene he danced better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American gift for drinking whiskey instead of wine . The gramophone at last gurgled to a halt , and the hotel manager ostentatiously slammed down the lid . One by one the people at the other tables finished their little drinks and went away . At eleven the string of bulbs dimmed to an orange glow , blazed to sudden whiteness , and went out . The pounding of the distant donkey engine wheezed to silence . A smoky lantern at the foot of the stairs that led to the upper rooms made a splotch of dim light in the darkness . The curfew was accepted uncritically . The two wives had been yawning with stout abandon . They rose . All shook hands elaborately . " Come to the Tribunal to-morrow , " Judge Morin urged . " We will lunch together and talk . " The deep shadows of the sleeping town enveloped them . The voices faded away . Feet crunched faintly in the gravel road between the bordering palms , then became inaudible . Gene stood by the steps , swaying slightly . With vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm familiarly . " You stay in this hotel , too , hein ? " She kept one arm linked with his but stretched with the other , leaning back her head so the coarse bobbed hair hung in a massy silhouette behind . " I am soo sleepy , " she murmured . " Let us go up ? " An oily whirlpool swam round again in Bryce 's head . They climbed the stairs . Caution was needed not to stumble . His heart beat with an insistent thudding . With meticulous care he wiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead . " That 's the worst of these coast towns , " be explained . " Up in the bush you get a good cool breeze in the evenings , anyway . " Manfselle Nelly did not reply . The narrow upper hallway was illumined only by a tiny night wick on a table . Gene reached the door of his own room , and by unflexing his elbow disengaged his arm . " Good night , Mam'selle . I certainly appreciate having met you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to him . His pent-up breath released with a faint moan , and his arm went round her . Her mouth was soft , compelling . She stirred against him with a motion that flung the blood booming in his temples . " We make love , hein ? " she whispered . " After one long year ? " He closed her mouth with his lips , nodding . The door was just behind . They turned and stumbled in . Gene came drowsily awake at dawn . The patch of sky through the unglassed window was a radiant blue , and across it trailed rose-gray wisps of cloud . The subdued voices of the hotel servants came up from the yard . There was everywhere a sense of stir and joy and summer morning . His eyes opened and surveyed the yellowed , ragged mosquito net on its suspended frame . Damn it , he thought . Forgot to put it down . What a fool trick . Have a shot of fever sure . . . . He stretched , conscious of delicious relaxation . In mid-stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung his feet to the floor . He glanced hastily around the room . She 'd gone . Good Lord ! The clarity of the first waking instant grayed into confusion . His eyes dimmed with shame , self-pity , and , uncontrollably , his lips curled with pride . He found his watch amid the pile of clothes on the floor . 6:15 . He jumped up . God ! there was no telling how soon the boat would he in . He went to the window and looked out . The harbor was hidden by the green tops of palms . A cracked mirror hung over the washstand , and for a long minute he examined his flushed face and tousled yellow hair . The image smirked back reassuringly . " Oh , what the hell ! " he said aloud . The sound of his own voice made him redden . He bellowed into space for the house-boy to run a bath and bring breakfast to his room . An hour later in a clean suit , his helmet wetly blue from fresh pipeclaying , Gene emerged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe waiters in white uniforms sat dozing against the stucco wall , their brown faces turned imperturbably toward the sun . He hesitated , looking doubtfully down the shady road . A ragged negro passed with a wheelbarrow , then a fat little Frenchman in moist neglige shirt and cloche helmet . Gene found a cigarette , lighted it , and smoked it halfway through . Then he flung it into the road and sought the manager of the hotel . He arranged for a second bedroom . Under the circumstances . Only for a couple of nights , at most , he explained with needless care . He was expecting a friend , a lady . Djomb6 River was rising , and they could n't fool around . He left the hotel again and sauntered through the shaded streets toward the waterfront . The clerk of the steamship office was breakfasting behind the lattice of an upstairs verandah . In halting English he shouted down the necessary information . The Fernand Vaz had arrived off the bar at daybreak . The tug would reach the quay by nine . Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two warehouses to the waterfront and found a place at the end of the mail wharf where he could wait . A moored lighter cast a narrow patch of shade . Except for the intermittent babbling of some negroes rolling palm-oil casks in front of a trader 's factory and the splutter of an occasional auto , the waterside was silent . The low iron sheds , the moored dugouts , the rusty , mud-trapped lighters , and the withered palms seemed to shrink beneath the molten pressure of the sky . The tide ran out , and the river tugged and whispered at the loose piles of the wharf . Struggling with a mood of depression , Bryce got up , walked over the coarse boarding and stood staring toward the sea . It was hard to accept that this was Djombe River , this flat , bright serenity that fanned out seaward through the dark lines of bordering mangroves . . . . Once Jeff , he remembered , had said a harbor was a river in old age . A speck in the distance shaped out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped his sweating forehead with nervous care . It was the tug . Marion was coming . A colored clerk from the postoffice , dressed with slightly shapeless perfection in white drill , joined him on the pier . They engaged in desultory , mutuallywearisome talk . With maddening sloth the tug drew nearer . Soon they were joined by a half-dozen whites , the men lank , bearded , malarial , the women too fat , too pale , and powder-sticky from the heat . An amorphous , casual company of slinking natives soon filled the wharf . Waterside stirred in anticipation . The squat tug came up and smashed creakingly against the piles so that the waiting crowd stumbled and nearly lost foothold . It drifted to position and , amid a deafeuing confusion of shouts , made fast . Bryce moved forward . A gigantic , ruddy French official in khaki and greasy helmet stepped heavily to the dock and turned aside . Marion appeared behind him . In an instant her hands were in his . P " Hello , Gene , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , he 'd forgotten how pretty she was . And she was an inch taller than he , of course . Her eyes  --  he 'd never properly realized before how darkly blue they were  --  sought his . Bryce 's glance sped uneasily about them and he blushed hotly . The unfamiliar , noisy crowd seemed to stare and smirk . A gaping negro face came close to his for an instant . This girl who had come to marry him seemed a stranger like the rest . Her half-forgotten prettiness increased his embarrassment . A white French face leered at them and he stiffened . " Are n't you going to kiss me ? " she asked . He pecked at her mouth , and was a little frightened at the clinging passion of her response . Someone brushed against them so violently they staggered . He acutely realized they were in the way . Bryce became loudly , cheerily busy about the baggage . No power on earth could have induced the moist douanier to question Madame 's baggage . In a few minutes the formalities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their way to the hotel . DJOMBE RIVER 9.75 They stood facing each other , smiling fleetingly , suddenly alone . The heat , reflected from the iron wall of the customs barn , from the gravel road , from their white clothes and helmets , was like the throbbing exhaust from a great machine . She was slenderer than he , he realized , and a little taller . About her mouth there was a look of mingled childish wonder , gaiety , and of an insubstantial fear . There were tired , careworn little lines at the corners of her eyes . Her hips were narrow , her white hands delicate . A thousand things were crowding to her lips , but she made him speak first . " Shall we walk around for a while or do you want to go up right away ? " he asked . Her eyes , wide with curiosity , drank in the scene around them . " No , indeed . " Bryce cleared his throat , on a note of gaiety which startled him by its unnecessary volume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't anything better to do just now , we might take a walk up to the Tribunal and see a friend of mine . " He took her arm . " I do n't know what your plans are , but I 'm going to get married ! " She smiled back at him . " I would n't miss it for anything . I suppose I 'm invited ? " With wide , elaborate gestures , a mannerism unnatural to him , Gene began to point out the streets and buildings and to name the kinds of trees . The Tribunal of Molala , a two-storey stucco building overshadowed by big trees smelled of sun on stone and rain-drenched leaves and ink and dust . Their feet clattered noisily in the deserted cement corridor . They reached an unvarnished wooden door marked with black letters , " M. le Jugs de la Circon-scription . " Gene lifted his hand to knock . " An set ? " he whispered . His voice shook uncontrollably . " Wait a minute . " She stayed his hand with her fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . sure ? You are n't just being sorry for me ? " He stepped back instinctively at the impassioned earnestness that overlaid her words . His shoddy , joking air fell miserably away . " Question is , do you want to ? " he said thickly . " I 'm darned if I know why anyone should . . . " " Oh , so much ! " " Here goes , then , " he rapped smartly on the door . " Entrez ! " Judge Morin in moist shirt-sleeves , a limp cigarette dangling from his mouth , sat at a hacked and ink-stained table . He rose with a stare of undisguised astonishment , recovered himself quickly , and greeted them . He ushered them ceremoniously to seats and returned to his own chair . As they began to explain his look traveled slowly between them . He leaned forward , hands on knees , a stout , gentle , vivid little man with thinning hair . Now and again he smiled brilliantly at Marion , occasionally interpolated a questioning word until he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elaborate history than they had at first intended . At the end Judge Morin asked a question . By his manner he somehow robbed it of any rudeness . " Mademoiselle , if you will pardon me , at the moment how much money have you ? In an emergency what amount could you possibly command ? In the whole world ? I feel , please , that I should like to know ? " She blushed slightly . " Perhaps a hundred dollars , Judge Morin . No more . " He nodded briskly and got up . " Very well , then . " He got a dilapidated , cloth-bound book from a high shelf and indicated that they should stand up . Sand-dry termites ' eggs trickled from the rotting binding as he turned the pages . He stepped into the gloomy , leaf-filtered light near the open window . Judge Morin read in rapid French , then translated each passage freely into English . They responded confusedly . At last he closed the volume , returned it to its shelf , and looked at them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My best wishes and my congratulations . This is perhaps not entirely legal and in order , but I am in a position to make it so . You are staying at the Grand ? Then I will call upon you this evening for your signatures to the proper papers . " He took Marion 's hands . " We do things carelessly in Africa , Madame Bryce , but we get them done . " He stooped , kissed her fingertips , then straightened up again . His kind eyes seemed unwilling to Iet her go . " You have come to a difficult land , my dear , " he said . " It is a country of great forests , great rivers , and for the most part very little human men ... . Again my best wishes . And if at any time ? .. . You understand me ? I shall be here forever , I think . And always shall I be at your service . " He dismissed them with a bow . They shook hands , exchanged the trivial courtesies , and Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . The judge spoke in a precise , biting undertone , " Last night , my friend , I think you were a very dirty little pig . Good morning ! " The two cafe boys still sprawled dozing against the hotel wall . It was not yet eleven , and they had not stirred . They climbed the steps in silence . The upper corridor , chill and echoing in the shuttered daytime twilight , was deserted . Bryce fumbled with a heavy key and opened a door . " This is your room . . . I . . . I 've got that one over there . " She looked at him steadily , and his face suffused a dull pink . He hurried on . " I figured you 'd be tired . And it 's only for to-night . If you 're willing I think we ought to start to-morrow . This is the beginning of our rainy season , you know . " Marion stepped past him into the room and pushed wide the shutters so the golden morning flooded in . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't see why you think I 'd be tired . I 've done nothing for a month but sit still on that boat .. . but of course it 's all right . " Her voice seemed to hover between scorn and tears , but her face was averted and Gene , by the door , could not tell . " Then how about starting up country to-morrow ? " " Of course . The sooner the better . " She turned , leaned against the windowsill , and faced him . Pulling off her wide-brimmed hat , she tossed it on the bed . Her dark hair clung moistly to her temples . She stroked it back with her forefingers , kept them rigidly there for an instant as if to steady her eyes . " Gene ? " " Yes ? " " After all , we have a job to do up there , have n't we ? " " Why , sure . . . " " I mean  --  a job for me , too ? Please , seriously . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I 'm just a beggar and I 'll die . " " Oh , for God 's sake , Marion .. . " His hands lifted and he started toward her . An echo of Morin 's words stabbed him and he halted clumsily . No , he could n't touch her . . . not yet awhile . Something kept him rigid and impersonal . It was as if , illogically , the situation presented a problem of etiquette rather than emotion . Fellows at home were awkward in the presence of best girls . It was almost a tradition . He felt there must be exact and gallant things to say , if only he had not forgotten them . He elaborated lamely . " Sure , of course . You 'll he ever so much help to Jeff and me . You 'll make everything different . " It was difficult to see her face clearly as she stood there framed against the sky . He faltered , found a cigarette , and lighted it . " Say , there 's a German fellow I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . It wo n't take me more'n an hour . I guess you 'll be glad of a chance to get your stuff unpacked and maybe wash up a little , huh ? " He broke a dull pause stutteringly . " I . . . I tell you . We 'll walk around town together all afternoon and see the sights . And shop . Might be a good idea if you bought some stuff , khaki and things , to make yourself some bush clothes when we get to Lolill . .. You used always to be sewing . " They started inland in the middle of the morning , Bryce on foot and Marion in a pole chair carried by four men . There was no one to see them off . A departure for the hinterland has little glamour . It begins as it ends , merely a silent , trudging walk in the heat of tropic daytime . A wide street intersects Molala and narrowing , stumbling a little , climbs a low hill behind the town . Turning , they looked for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port and out beyond over the shimmering mirror of Djomb6 River and the sea . The road dwindled to a footpath , and in another mile the sea and the town were a vague memory . The jungle had closed in . There was a flavor of rot and growth and everlasting summer . The air was gray-green ; there were no sounds but the rhythmic pat-pat of the porter 's feet and the far-away harsh cries of birds in the tops of trees . Bryce , helmet pushed back , a folded handkerchief under the band to keep the sweat from his eyes , walked ahead , hands hanging . Perspiration streamed steadily down his face and dribbled itchingly over his bare knees . He kept his eyes on the ground . The steady trudge , trudge through the steaming day left no energy or will for thought . . . Far within his consciousness , hidden by the heat of blood in his cheeks and the hurt of his feet against the baking earth , was a sensation of gratitude at the postponement . For the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too hot to finish sentences . .. or seek solutions . . or to wonder . **35;0;TOOLONG ... like a drum , like a dry drum beat in sunlight , all thoughts resolved to empty words and words to stupid sounds . And the sounds beat time . Marion 's belongings had been repacked in six new tin boxes , each carried on the head of a Lolill porter . Four tall natives brought up the rear with the pole chair . She submitted to three hours of it but by mid-morning , feeling sore and giddy from the jerking , snapping motion of the seat , she stopped her men and got down . Grinning appreciatively , they hoisted the poles to easy balance on their skulls and trotted forward , the sweat glistening on their bare brown backs . She watched the play of their muscles and the twinkle of their thin legs until they vanished round a turn . The sound of voices died away and loneliness , like a ghost , gathered huge and still around her . Now and then , somewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmur like a living breath high overhead where the branches interwove . Lips parted , eyes shadowed with wonder , she stood still and savored it . An increased brightness up above was the only hint of sky . She pressed her palms against her breasts , her face upturned . Here , she knew , she had come to beauty . Nothing , forever and ever , could rob her of that . After a moment , with a troubled , matter-of-fact little sigh she stuffed wandering bits of hair up under her helmet and began to walk . At two o'clock they crossed Djombe River . A dugout canoe carried them , the porters , and the boxes over , three by three . A chain of twisted vines fastened to trees on either bank spanned the stream , a distance of more than thirty yards . A black ferryman stood forward in the dugout and dragged painfully hand over hand along the green , leaping cable , keeping the boat 's nose upstream and sidling it slowly over . Bryce , squatting in the bottom and clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same one that makes Molala a port . The damn ' thing twists around so we have to cross it five times on this trip . And there are n't any more ferries after this one , either . " His mouth weakly half-open , he looked apprehensively at the muddy water that rushed bubbling past the sides of the canoe . " If the rains have n't carried ' em away , there are some rotten native bridges , though . " The knotty black shoulders of the ferryman strained and heaved , jerked and heaved again . He sang a half-uttered , grunting song . Slowly the canoe edged over , keeling crazily . " Our bungalow , " Gene added , " is just by Djombe River . There 's a big sort of cascade behind the hill and when you listen you can hear it always . " He fell silent . With wide eyes she gazed at the twirling , sliding water . The yellow river swept toward and past them with terrific force . At the end of each day 's march they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forest clearings deep as wells and in the night as dark . Several families , with simple hospitality , would always vanish , leaving their beehive huts at the disposal of the travelers . Inasmuch as the diameter of a Gaboon native house rarely exceeded eight feet , it was found convenient to set up his cot in one and hers in another . By seven o'clock they had eaten their food and were asleep . " Wait till we get to the bungalow . . " Gene said . And she , " When we get home . " They pressed on rapidly , starting early and halting late . There was real need for haste . Every afternoon dark clouds obscured the sun , the light darkened to dull green , and the sky poured down . Tiny draggled figures in the shining streaks of rain , they plodded on . The bubbling , tepid water , settling in the depression of the trail , fanned sloshing back from the push of their ankles . Theskin of their hands and feet puckered as from long submergence in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only mistily aware that Marion did not use her chair and walked alone behind the caravan . One fact , concise and terrible , filled his imagining . The great rains of Africa had come . Never had he guessed they could be so violent . One reckoned rainfall at home by inches in a year , but here one measured by feet in a month . In each wet season water enough fell to cover the whole region to a depth of seven yards . That knowledge loomed in his mind with the hugeness of a fabled beast . And Djombe River , roaring toward the sea , was rising every hour . Four more times he knew it crossed their road . Then three times . Before this all personal things had insubstantial shape , seemed triviaL Later on there would be time . The ninth morning he heard the rumble of it once again . The path crossed a native farm where burnt , felled trees , indeterminate and evil-shaped , sprawled in a black bed of mud and ashes . The sky was gray , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river lay beyond a clump of trees . When he had come through them he saw with a catch of the breath that the vine bridge , ordinarily twenty feet above the water , sprang and jerked as if it were alive . At one point in its natural sag the flood rushed through it inches deep . Undecided , he peered into the dripping branches of the anchoring tree . Apparently the strands of liana were still firmly fixed . When the file of porters came up he gestured vaguely and stood aside . The lead man , after one appraising look , picked his way up the root ladder , tested the bridge with one foot , and stepped out upon it . The rest followed . Gene watched , his fingernails forcing into his clenched palms . Midway the water lapped their knees , and the woven trough sagged dangerously . A few more paces and they had reached the other DJO MB RIVER e79 side , were already walking on , quickly dwindling in the mist . The four hammock men came up . Marion , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They huddled uncertainly beneath the dripping leaves . The natives , puzzled , cycd the bridge and considered the awkward thing they carried . " Do you want it ? " Marion asked . Her voice was quietly practical . " Because I certainly do n't . I hardly use it at all . " Gene wiped his hand across his mouth and shook his head . She nodded at the men . It occurred to Bryce that they had settled this matter long ago . The carriers hastily shouldered it , ran back down the path and , with a joyous heave , flung the thing into the grass . He watched them stupidly . The lashing murmur of the river seemed to have dulled his senses . With a pang of fear and anger he realized Marion was already making her way over . The four men followed . He was the last to cross . He was trembling and his face was red . Damn her , she did n't know the river like he did . . . it was her fault anyway , coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . . . . A vision of her young body , her firm breasts , her slender hips , the shape of her thighs accentuated by the clinging cloth of her muddy dress , sprang into his mind and his veins throbbed . . .. No damn ' use acting like a baby . He drew in his breath wheezingly . When they got to the bungalow .. . His passion cooled . When they got to the bungalow , then he 'd do anything for her . He sighed and flushed . What a stupid , embarrassed beginning they had made  --  that business in Molala , then the walk , and the rain , and the river . He began to dogtrot , splashing and slipping through the muddy rivulets that drained across the path . He supposed he 'd looked a coward , letting the others go over first . The next bridge was only an hour farther on . He resolved to getthere first and show her . Show ' em all he was n't afraid . Not of a river . He soon overtook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he pushed past . Marion stopped and stood aside inquiringly . " I 'm going ahead and look at the river . See if it 's safe , " he explained . With each moment the load upon him seemed to lighten . The trip was nearly done and they had come through it safely . There was only the one more crossing and that would let him recoup his pride before her eyes ; in a way , before his own . These exhausting , defeating days after all had been mere prologue . The first porters , a wet , brown-gray little huddle of figures , were squatting beside their loads in the high grass at one side . He strode on , head up , importantly . They rose silently and followed . The crossing was the last except for the one just below Lorin . He had noticed it especially on the way down . At that point the river was narrow , deep , and incredibly swift . The straight banks were solid and on a level . A big tree had been felled so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few bars . Bound to be all right . At worst they 'd only have the bother of chopping down another tree . It was n't more than fifty feet . Easy to find a big one growing in the right position . The sky had begun to thin and grow bluely luminous . The drizzle ceased . Everything was going to he all right . He 'd show her . The great black trunk was still there . Though the bank had been gouged out several feet and the surface of the water was only an inch or two under the log , it was still perfectly sound . When the carriers arrived he motioned them cheerfully to wait . Marion joined him . " This is the last but one , " he told her loudly , " and the other does n't count . " He scrambled to the log , stopped , and turned his head . " Remember what the I judge told you  --  about rivers and men ? Do n't let him kid you . Watch this ! " Arms out , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A recollection came out of the years of a fat little boy on a picket fence  --  a high fence along a dusty summer lane . " Watch this ! " She screamed . A huge floating log appeared above the swirling surface and bore ravenously toward the bridge . There was a terrific concussion when it struck , a fearful smashing and rending . The huge trunk writhed upward , vanished . Gene had shot into the air , splashed down and disappeared . Marion groped for support , and her fingers found the coarse wetness of tree bark . The carriers had thrown down their loads and were running through the high grass along the bank . Queer , birdlike little notes of fright came back from them . In a moment they were gone . She moved to follow them , staggered weakly , and sat down . She puckered her dry eyelids with an effort of memory . . . Gene had run across the log . Halfway she had seen him hesitate , grow still with horror . In that instant a massive , derelict log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged against the bridge . There was not room for it to carry safely under . The impact had catapulted Gene into mid-torrent . The log , forced from its resting place on the far bank , had twisted , splashed , and swept magnificently away . There had been no possibility of hope . No one could live in Djombe River in the time of rains . . . . So Gene was dead . She was alone . This was the end . Her eyes slowly dimmed with tears . The great adventure , then , had come to this . The bright dreams of the lonely years , the shining world . a man who wanted her , a man to help , to love  --  all these swept away in the gray , empty jungle rain by a river  --  by Djombe River . Long , slow moments passed . A wood pigeon cooed faintly in a treetop . The silence , the desolate loveliness of the woods pressed down upon her , an irony of immortality and peace . She said aloud , " Djaiabe River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . She rose to her feet , went to the bank , and dropped upon her knees , letting her hands dangle in the water . how cool , how living was its touch . It tugged lightly at her fingertips and she drew them back , afraid . She gazed wonderingly up the dark cavern of the overhanging trees from which the river came . . . . Perhaps , farther on , farther on . . . Farther on among the years there might still he a place or a task that wanted her . She faced the gathering certainty of days . Gene had n't . Not at all . He 'd never touch her , never kissed her . He was just . . being kind . Poor Gene . Sobs flooded her throat , tears her eyes , and she crumpled down , a lonely , weeping little figure in the high wet grass by the river . The wood pigeon cooed again . The raindrops pattered in a stir of wind . An hour later the carriers reappeared . A mile downstream the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was no trace of the drowned man . They were still whispering excitedly , re-enacting the accident with wide gestures . They stopped at sight of Marion . The headman , a tall , middle-aged negro in ragged shorts , touched her gently on the shoulder . " Mammy . We make bush house here for now . To-morrow we cut tree and go for Lolill . Old massa he wait for there . We no find young massa . He done finish . .. . Papa Djombe ... . Black boy say they be . . . they be sorry . " His lined brown face puckered with sympathy . " We be your boy now , Mammy . We go for Lolill ? " She looked up at him , slowly nodded . ( To Be Concluded )
