txt Letters to the Editor DIAL WITH A SMILE . Mugwump or Boloney Will Get Your Number for You . To the Editor of The New York Times : The complaint frequently heard about the difficulty in remembering one 's telephone number under the new system is quite unjustified . The telephone authorities have presented us with an excellent plaything and aid to memory , for which we should be everlastingly grateful . If I want to call a number such as MUrray Hill 4-9867 , I have not to memorize it . I just dial " Mugwump " and it comes at once . RA " enswood 8-7243 is " Sausage . " Columbus 5-0639 is too much to carry in the mind at one time , so I dial " Boloney " and get it swiftly . In fact , I get on better with this system than with the old one , except that I fail to make the pause called for be-i tween the initial figure and the re- i maining four figures because am quicker on this system . Possessors of numbers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their cable address also . It 's a grand scheqie . My only regret is I can not do anything better than " Plesido " with my own number , but at least I can remember it Without difficulty . Properly handled , this could be made the most fascinating indoor game ever invented . Yet there are people who grumble at the telephone authorities . E. W.

To the Editor of The New York Times : The road and route markings in New York State have been notoriously poor and deficient . Some time last Winter , I believe it was , I read in your columns of plans to Make it one of the best-marked States . I have just returned from a trip that carried me northward from Harrisburg , Pa. , ' via Watkins Glen and the Finger Lakes to Geneva and thence westward to Lake Erie and along that lake to Cleveland and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is yet much to be desired . In some places route numbers are duplicated , while in others there are none where needed , thus forcing a stranger to inquire his way . The arrows on the markers indicating a change of direction at a road fork or crossroad are often so placed as to be confusing and sometimes misleading . Furthermore , the arrows are so small that they can not be seen until one is upon them . They should be large enough to be seen before reaching the place of change of direction . Better yet , there should be a warning of change , e. g. , R. 20 , 100 to 200 feet before reaching the place of change . Also there should be a marker on the route after the change is made to reassure the stranger . In brief , I recommend the system of Ohio , which I think is the bestmarked State in the country . A stranger can not get lost or delayed here . And I am not a native  --  only a sojourner . So I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ohio . June 24. 1931 . SMITH AND ROOSEVELT . Rebuttal From a Reader , With a Boom for Mr. Young . To the-Editor of The New York Times : Your recent editorial conveying the intimation that it was up to exGovernor Smith to announce publicly his support of the candidacy of Governor Roosevelt for the 1932 Democratic Presidential nomination strikes the writer as in extremely bad taste . Something of the sort might have been expected to emanate from a gathering of self-constituted President-makers following a probably very satisfying and pleasing luncheon like that at the Manchester , Mass. , home of the former **27;91;TOOLONG of the Wilson Administration . Ex-Governor Smith is probably quite well qualified to determine for himself whether or not it is his duty to state his support of the candidacy of Governor Roosevelt , and if the supporters of Governor Roosevelt 's Presidential aspirations are correct in their assumption that the Governor is the best qualified man to be President , they need not worry that the ex-Governor will be lacking in a proper course of action at the proper time . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , that it is about time  --  and particularly at this time  --  that candidates for the Presidency , at least , should be selected with less consideration of possible political indebtedness of one man or of one group to another and more with regard to their ability to guide the nation 's helm during the period of their proposed incumbency . But perhaps that is too much to hope for under our present political system . I  --  and I feel certain millions of my fellow-citizens  --  consider Governor Smith the outstanding leader of constructive liberal thought in America today , and as such no pronouncements from either representatives of " nice " elements of his party or its " practical " politicians and his luncheon partners can remove him from serious consideration to lead his party in the 1932 campaign . Along with Governor Smith , it would seem to the writer that the Democratic party might do well to consider the opportunity that might be theirs in the selection of Owen D. Young as their candidate to lead the country out of the mess that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time ( and , as a Democrat , permit me to add , not through the fault of President Hoover 's Administration , except . per- , ham to the extent . to which the hy- pocrisy of prohibition has contrib. uted ) . Leaving out the question of " politi-e cal expediency , " which the writer considers a contributing cause of many of our present-day ills , it is difficult to see how a comparison of the records and qualifications of Governor Roosevelt and Mr. Young can leave any doubt as to the lat. ter 's greater and more timely fitness for the task that lies ahead of the President of the United States in the next four years . JAMES A. HEALY . New York , June 25 , 1931 . NEW YORK FROM THE AIR . A Colorful Discovery Made While on the Los Angeles . To the Editor of The New York Times : What is the most striking sight on the island of Manhattan as one passes over it , loafingly , in the slow-. ly moving dirigible Los Angeles ? This writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a ' voyage in this ship of the air , , including a passage over New York . We come gliding up the Hudson , past the Statue of Liberty . Here 's the Battery , with its geometric designs of footpaths . There 's the Empire State Building below us . Not one of the seven passengers has yet shouted , " Oh , look at that ! " All Central Park finally lies beneath us , lovely in the curves of its roadways and in its half-dozen lakes and ponds . We enjoy the view , but no one is astonished by it . We turn down along Park Avenue and then . head toward the lower east side . " Look ! Look ! " A stranger from Kansas City is pointing downward toward the lower east side . " What 's that ? " he demands . " Oh , that 's only the east side , " re. - plies a New Yorker . " But look at those streets ! " We do . Every one " ah 's , " as if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , First Avenue , Second Avenue , Allen Street  --  you would n't know them . For thousands of feet , . along their curbs , stretch narrow ribbons of gorgeous colors , bright as borders of old-fashioned flowers along garden walks . We are seeing the canopies that cover the east side 's pushcarts ; it is early afternoon and a beaming sun is beating down on the many-hued covers and making them appear more brilliant , perhaps , than they are . Anyhow , here 's something new about old New York ; a new sight in the old town . In future days of air travel parting advice to a friend about to sail for New York will include the suggestion : " And do n't forget to see the colored streets on the east side . " WILLIAM G. SHEPHERD . Locust , N. J. , June 30 , 1931 . FAMILIAR WORDS OF 1893 . Quokation Recalled Seems to Fit Our Present Situation . To the Editor of The New York Times : " We are at present in the midst of a great industrial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the earth . The consumptive power , or rather the purchasing power , of the world has been interfered with , producing not only a derangement but a paralysis , not only stopping further production but preventing the proper distribution of what there is already created ; so that we have the anomalous spectacle of abundant food products on the one hand and hungry men without bread on the other ; abundant fabrics on the one hand and industrious , frugal men going half clad on the other . Employer and employe are affected alike . " Casual reading of the above quotation might suggest that those were the words of some contemporary economist descriptive of present conditions . But they were spoken by John P. Altgeld at Chicago on Labor Day , Sept. 8 , 1893 , while he was Governor of Illinois , during the acute stages of the financial panic which he said was precipitated by the agitation for the repeal of the silver purchase act and by the demonetization of silver by most of the European nations . It was several years after those words were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world-wide economic depression far more widespread and profound , resulting from a great war that caused an " enormous derangement of industry , trade and finance the world over , " and in the light of the experiences of 1893 and other more or less similar epochs , we may have some fairly adequate Idea of the probable duration of the present depression .
