txt Congressional leaders started setting the stage today for the swiftest possible adoption of President Roosevelt 's social security program and at the same time prepared for simultaneous if not earlier action on the new work relief plan designed to transfer 3,500,000 employables from relief rolls to payrolls and 1,500,000 unemployables to local care . Speaker Byrns and Chairman Buchanan of the Appropriations Committee announced a tentative plan whereby the work relief bill would be submitted to the House early next week and passed under a strict " gag rule . " They proposed that the bill , which would be an appropriation , include the $4,000,000,000 lump sum asked by the President , the reappropriation of $880,000,000 in unobligated departmental balances to finance relief during the transition period , and $300,000,000 carried in the regular budget for new public works . President Roosevelt indicated that be would leave procedure largely to his Congressional field marshals . He announced , however , that he would submit to Congress next week a report of his National Resources Board and a report on the Mississippi Valley , indicating the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other natural resource areas . Begins National Work Inventory . Secretary Ickes announced even earlier that he had begun a national inventory of possible construction projects for the information of the President in his work relief plans . The President stated in his first message to the new Congress that his new policy would be devoted largely to conserving and developing the vast natural resources of the country and to self-liquidating public projects . The social security program will be started through the legislative mill Monday . Hearings before the Ways and Means Committee will start on that day , and testimony before the Senate Finance Committee will begin on Tuesday . Chairman Doughton of the House committee began compiling a list of witnesses late today , while Senator Harrison , chairman , held an extended conference with Edward F. , Assistant Secretary of Labor , on proceedings before the Senate committee . As members of Congress had more opportunity to consider the specific suggestions of the President , as translated in the Wagner-Lewis bills , prospects of Congressional attempts to " liberalize " the social security program began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Townsend plan and other schemes for immediate oldage assistance , groups were forming with the idea of attempting to increase the amounts proposed for this particular phase of the plan . The President proposed for immediate old-age pensions that the government share a fifty-fifty responsibility with the States up to $30 a month for indigent persons more than 65 years of age . This is considerably less , of course , than the $200-a-month proposed by Dr. F. E. Townsend for all people above 60 . State Responsibility Emphasized . Mr. Roosevelt at his press conference today emphasized that the States might provide more than $30 a month . His proposal meant , he sad , that the government would bear half of the cost up to that amount . He re-emphasized the principle of State responsibility inherent in the whole plan . The plan for Federal and State old-age " assistance " is for immediate action and is not to be confused with the more permanent plan for old-age " insurance , " whereby the younger employes may build up pension reserves for old age by mutual contributions with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might take as long as thirty years to put the latter pensions into full force . That part of the program dealing with immediate old-age assistance seemed to hold the attention of the greater number of members of Congress . As to the other proposals , for unemployment insurance financed by a payroll tax , for FederalState aid benefits to needy mothers and children and for other health benefits  --  the average member had little or nothing to say . Senator Harrison , as well as Representative Doughton , said committees would seek to develop all the facts and views relative to all of these subjects . Both indicated that they would be glad to hear from Dr. Townsend , whose proposal for a $200-a-month pension , to be spent within the month , for every aged person over 60 has caused much agitation among many members , particularly from the West . Mr. Roosevelt remarked that he had not asked Congress to pass the security program within any definite time . He added , however , that la good many of the forty-four Legislatures meeting this year were likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of April , and thus indicated a desire to have the legislation passed in ample time to allow appropriate action by the States . House leaders indicated that the work relief bill might be passed in that body by Tuesday night . They made no secret of their purpose to ask an airtight rule for consideration of the measure , one limiting general debate as well as amendments . The President has practically demanded that the $4,000,000,000 appropriation be given him in a lump sum , for use at his direction . He has given assurances that his plan will call for a maximum of selfliquidating projects and that , as a whole , the need for work-relief will be self-diminishing . He has asked , too , that the reappropriation of $880,000,000 for relief during the transitory period be likewise in a single amount . He has given his consent for the $300,000 , - 000 sum for public works to be allocated by general categories .

From Mr. Ickes 's announcement of a national survey of possible projects , it was inferred that the administration hoped to begin its new work-relief program soon after March 1 . In a request to State and municipal authorities for aid in making the check-up , the Secretary stressed the necessity of completing this task before March 1 . Questionnaires have already been sent to all PWA State engineers . The Secretary emphasized to the State and local authorities that the inventory did not mean that the PWA would receive new applications for loans and grants at this time , nor should the answers to the questionnaires and submission of schedules be considered as applications for funds . He asked that all available work be listed , particularly in the following categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbish disposal plants , gas plants , electric power systems , street railway and transit improvements , streets , highways , bridges , public buildings , hospitals , homes for domiciliary care , penal institutions , markets , warehouses , slum clearance and housing projects , recreational facilities , shipping and terminal facilities .
