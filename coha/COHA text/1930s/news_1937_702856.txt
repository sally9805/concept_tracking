txt Two developments Friday served to show the extent to which the corn refining industry of the United States is marking time pending the arras al on the market of the new crop of lower-priced corn Corn Products Refining Co. , declaring its usual draldend on its common stock , pointed out that the volume or business is low due to the trade anticipaung the effect of corn prices A. E Staley Manufacturing Co. of Decatur , lll , announced that it had sold around 200,000 bushels or old crop corn to Chicago dealers who planned to tender the corn on September contracts in the ruturcs market Staley also announced that its plan temporarily has curtailed operations , and that work will be resumed as soon as the corn market becomes more stable . In an unprecedented official forecast , Corn Products said that the result of domestic operations for the quarter ending September 30 will be poor because of the high price of corn , adjustment of inventory , and the low volume of business . Declaration of a dividend which will be considerably in excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " a return to normal profits is expected in the near future " The company added that earnings of the foreign affiliated companies are very satisfactory . Profits Less Than Dividend in Half In the first two quarters of 1937 , Corn Products failed to earn its dividend . Net profits in the first and second quarters were ** and $2,136,386 , respectively . The outlook for the third quarter is that profits will be under those of the two preceding quarters , possibly in the neighborhood of the $1,491,506 , which the company earned in the third quarter of 1935 . Then somewhat similar conditions prevailed , but with the arrival on the market of the larger 1935 corn crop late that year , earnings were restored . jumping to $2,974,837 in the final quarter in 1935 . In 1936 every quarter 's earnings topped the quarterly dividend requirements of $2,327,541 at the current $3 annual rate on the common stock . Corn Products , it is understood , has not sold any of its corn holdings , and will grind the cereal which it now holds . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replace them with lower priced corn might interfere with deliveries against orders , particularly on packaged goods which reflect consumer demand quite closely . Crop Movement in Early Start However , where a manufacturer has provided supplies of corn designed to protect himself against any possible contingency , and can now see that the supplies are greater than are needed to carry over until the arrival of the new crop corn , it is profitable and not unusual for the surplus corn to be sold in the cash market . Ordinarily the new crop is in full movement by November 1 , and sometimes as early as October 15 . The movement this year is getting underway a little earlier than usual , although it is said that not much corn is corning in in merchantable quantities and that some of it runs high in moisture content and in low grade . Corn and Industry CHICAGO  --  The squeeze in September corn prices is havmg little effect on operations of corn processors , it became known yesterday , when a survey of several large users of the grain disclosed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry them through to the new . crop . Having planned for some time to increase their corn inventories with the oncoming crop , at low prices . processors have been operating pretty much on a day-to-day basis from supplies in stock . Distillers and processors have held operations at reduced levels for the past few weeks rather than purchase and put through current high-price grain . Much of their requirements have been coming from the Argentine , with only a small blend of domestic cereal . This source , however , no longer will be drawn upon since the new domestic crop will undersell imported varieties . Allied Mills . Inc. , has closed its distillery until it can obtain new corn , but is continuing to operate its feed division on a reduced basis . Hiram Walker 's large Peoria distillery is operating at a somewhat reduced rate . This company is understood to have enough corn to carry it through until next month and thus is out of the current market . Operations are expected to increase as soon as new corn supplies are available . The market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorts on the Chicago Board of Trade . The cereal has gyrated wildly in recent sessions , fluctuating as much as the permissible 8 cents in one session . Yesterday . price ranged between $1.06 to $1.12 , closing strong . Highest price for the season was 1.16% , established a week ago . On the other hand , new corn for delivery in October is selling around 70 cents a bushel and December futures are around 65 cents . With but two sessions remaining during which outstanding commitments in the present month contracts can be equalized in the trading pit , any prophecy of the outcome would be foolhardy because of the secrecy with which trading positions are veiled . Warns of Tapioca Imports Early domination of the industrial starch market by duty-free importations of tapioca and sago starches from the Orient is indicated by Department of Commerce reports , which show a rise in shipments of the foreign product , the Corn Industries Research Foundation states Entries of tapioca and sago in the seven months to the end of July were 301,000,000 pounds against 153,000,000 in the corresponding period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The present effect of these rising importa. tions is to wipe out any possibility of domestic starch manufacturers sharing in the increasing consumption of industrial starches as the pace of business picks up , " the foundation says . " Importations for the year to date indicate a probable total of more than 500,000,000 pounds by the end of 1937 , an increase of 97% over 1936 . In terms of corn , this is equal to over 15.000.000 bushels , and while this is only a small proportion of the country 's total corn crop , it constitutes a substantial part of the corn shipped off the farms " The theoretical cash loss in farm income amounts to better than $18,000,000 at July prices , with an additional $200,000 which would be collected in shelling charges , " the Foundation says . - Tapioca and sago are on the free list , whereas all other industrial starches from abroad are subject to duty .
