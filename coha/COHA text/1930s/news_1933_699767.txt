txt The subcellar office of the eccentric and wealthy Edward Albert Ridley at 63 Allen Street , where a man was murdered two years ago , was the scene of a second and a third murder yesterday , and this time it was the 88-year-old Ridley himself  --  known all over the east side for his odd dress , his reputed millions and his Whitmanesque beard  --  and his secretary , Lee Weinstein , who were the victims . They were killed in the same damp , poorly lighted , littered and musty room where , two years ago , Herman Moench , the only other secretary Ridley ever had , met a similar fate . Weinstein was shot five times and the old man was beaten to death . The death of Moench had remained one of New York 's murder mysteries , and yesterday it began to appear that the deaths of Ridley and his new secretary also would remain unsolved . The police found no information leading them either to the motive or the murderers , unless an old , high swivel stool , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should give up tell-tale fingerprints . Robbery Discounted as Motive . Robbery was discounted immediately as a possible motive . The pockets of the old man , containing a few business papers , $1.85 in silver and copper coins and a gold watch , had not been disturbed . Neither had the pockets of Weinstein . In one pocket the secretary had $19 and in another $6.87 . There were various other effects , including a penknife and some papers , but none had been touched . In his manner of dress , his personal habits and his appearance , Ridley was Iike a character out of Dickens . In 1901 , when he and his brother Arthur sold out the once large and flourishing department store that had been founded by their father , Edward Albert Ridley , he established an office in the subbasement of 63 Allen Street . The little room , hardly more than eight feet wide and about twenty feet long , was forty feet below the sidewalk . No sound penetrated there from the rattling Second Avenue elevated . At first Ridley , attended and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy in the department store and been promoted to the place of bookkeeper , found the dampness uncomfortable . So he wore rubbers over his shoes . In time they came to be an article of clothing as necessary to him as his shoes , and he wore them all the time , everywhere . The cave-like office was several degrees too cool for comfort all year round . So he added an overcoat to the articles of apparel that he wore perennially . A man who had been raised in the tradition of changing styles for others  --  for before the business district moved , uptown , Edward Ridley &; Sons department store was a fashionable one  --  he never changed his own . Always he wore a derby hat , clamped down over his flowing white hair , and a frock coat . Office Under Former Stable . In order to reach his office  --  the building had been the five-story stable of the department store  --  he had to go through a gate opening into Allen Street and down a long wooden ramp , cleated in the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which once housed the wagonwright and blacksmith shops . In recent years it had been filled with automobiles in dead storage , for the stable had become a garageTo the right of the ramp , in the semi-darkness , a flight of eight or ten stone steps led to the sub-cellar . Long ago , when water rents were running high and the tenants in his many east side apartment and tenement houses used what he thought was too much water , Ridley drilled a well in the subcellar . Installing his own pipes and pumping system , he supplied his tenants with water . At first the Board of Health gave him a permit , but that later was revoked , the floor was cemented over and the pump taken out . A thin partition was built to separate the office from the rest of the floor , and the steps led directly into the office . Against the narrow wall nearest to the door was a high desk , and in front of it a high stool , at which sat first Moench and later Weinstein , keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office was Ridley 's desk , a roll-top affair with a swivel chair . From the centre of the ceiling hung a single electric light that fought bravely against the gloom . Commuted Daily From Jersey . Ridley spent a good part of every day , including Sunday , In his office . He came in from Fanwood , N. J. , on the 7:56 train every morning . At Fanwood he lived in a boarding house on Martine Avenue , kept by Miss Emma Voucher . She said that as far as she knew , he had been living there for thirty-five years ? the beginning was a little before her time . Neither Miss Voucher nor her boarders knew much about him . For every one , when he came down in the morning with his umbrella , his overcoat and his rubbers , though it may have been the fairest of July days , he had a pleasant " good morning , " but said little else . Sometimes he would walk the two and a half miles to the station at Westfield . instead of the halfmile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he always came home on the 5:04 ? he would say something about a bird or a flower he had seen on his walk , but he never talked about anything else . So he lived , affably taciturn ; startling people into curiosity by his appearance and giving them virtually nothing else to feed it on . He arose yesterday as usual , breakfasted on his customary orange juice , one soft-boiled egg , one slice of toast and coffee , and left the house . He usually reached his office ' betweet : 9:30 and 10 , and it was assumed that he did again yesterday . Weinstein , who was 44 years old and lived at 1,042 East Fifty-eighth Street , Brooklyn , with his mother , Mrs. Jennie Weinstein. and his sister , Mrs. Rose Kugleman , also left his house at the usual time . As far as was known , both were at the office at 10 o'clock . When Moench was murdered on Jan. 3 , 1931 , Weinstein and his brother , Harry , of 1,490 Jesup Avenue , the Bronx , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that time the old man had entered his place as usual and sat down at his desk . He looked around for Moench , saw his coat hanging on the customary peg , and assumed that he was somewhere about the building . About an hour ls , ter , getting up to get a ledger , he stumbled over Moench 's feet , sticking from behind the desk , where he had fallen after he had been shot twice . Ridley needed a new secretary , and he liked Lee Weinstein , so the brothers gave up the garage lease and Lee went to work for the elderly man . Phone Calls Reveals Murders . Yesterday his brother Harry tried to call him at 10:30 o'clock , but there was no answer on the telephone in the sub-cellar office . He called again at 12:30 and , still getting no answer , he called the ga- rage where Joseph Fiduccia of 279 East 122d Street worked as floor man for his brother James , who held the lease and operated the business . Joseph called down the ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hot leave the floor at the moment , but would go dawn later and get Weinstein to the phone . He apparently forgot about it ; at any rate Harry Weinstein called again at 1:30 o'clock , and this time Fiduccia went down . A few moments later he was calling the police , and when the information he gave was relayed to headquarters over the teletype , Inspector John J. Sullivan went over to take charge . The police found the old man lying on his face outside his office and just at the foot of the stone stairs . His head had been beaten , and the overturned stool , . with blood stains on its heavy swivel seat , indicated the instrument of his death . One of his rubbers had come off and was lying just inside the office door . Patches of his beard were strewn over the office floor . His umbrella hung on the corner of his desk . He had not been shot . Inside the office , lying on his back , was Weinstein . He had been shot twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neck and once in the face . After a preliminary examination , Assistant Medical Examiner Gonzales said that both might have been dead as long as three hours . The papers in the office were untouched . The two old-fashioned safes had not been disturbed . The open racks along the walls , on which ledgers and other books were kept , were in good order . One ledger was spread open on Weinstein 's desk . Revenge Hinted as Motive . Unable to discover anything compatible with a theory of robbery for murder , Inspector Sullivan hazarded the guess , and declared it was only a guess , that the two men might have been murdered by some tenant who felt he had been treated unfairly . The same theory had been advanced two years ago in the unsolved murder of Moench . But Moench , who had formed the habit of carrying a pistol five . years before , when tenants made threats because of a shortage of heat in the apartments , due to a coal strike , never had had occasion to use it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant had been to blame . It was found that - the subcellar office could be reached from three entrances to the building . To reach it by two of them , however , it would be necessary to go into the garage and down the elevator , coming through the subcellar from the dark side . The man on duty in the garage was certain to see any one who entered that way . The other way was down the ramp , which might or might not be noticed . At one side of the door opening into Allen Street , Ridley had a sign , " E. A. Ridley , Sub-Basement . " A hand pointed to the door . However , virtually every person whc sought him had to ask directions in the garage . Fiduccia remembered that two persons had asked directions during the morning , one around 10:30 and one somewhat later . But he could not remember what they looked like and said he had not noticed if any of them went down , Samuel Seiden , who has a brass shop at 57 Allen Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men , one elderly and one about 2l years ' old , had asked him how to get to Ridley 's office . His description of the men was also vague . Several Relatives Found . It was believed Ridley had many relatives in and around New York . One , Arthur J. Ridley of 2 St. Paurs Court , Brooklyn , said he had not seen his uncle in some time . He said that Ridley was born in Leicester , England , and came to this country in his boyhood with his father . Members of the family had been merchants in England for generations , he said . A sister , Mrs. John Gerken of 983 East Seventeenth Street , Brooklyn , was also located . She Is old and in poor health , and news of her brother 's death was kept from her . The extent of Ridley 's wealth could not be determined . When the department store was sold in. 1901 , what had been a concern employ- ' ing , 2,500 persons and doing a business of $6,000,000 a year , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then into the subbasement cave and continued to do a real estate business . His brother , Arthur , established a brokerage firm . Ridley at one time told an interviewer that he had made several millions dealing in real estate . Whether he was , as he was reputed to be , a millionaire was not known . He owned ' property at 2,232 Fifth Avenue , 538 West Fifty-fifth Street , 233-235 West 111th Street , 59-63 Allen Street , 206 Delancey Street , 88 Eldridge Street , 319-321 Grand Street , 57-63 Orchard Street , 1,406 Park Avenue and 112 West 131st Street . Real estate men were of the belief that he owned considerably more under corporate names . His body , taken to the morgue , probably will be claimed today by his nephew for burial .
