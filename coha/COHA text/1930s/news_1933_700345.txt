txt In tomorrow 's NEW YORK Dickens 's TIMES Magazine there is an Youngest article on CHARLES DICKENS Son , and Christmas . It is from the hand of Sir HENRY FIELDING DICKENS , the youngest son and last surviving child of the great novelist , who died in London on Thursday , almost on Christmas Eve . He was born in the same year as " David Copperfield , " and lived to be very nearly 85 . His father died at the age of 58 , but it was a long enough career in which to people the world with a brood of immortal children , sprung from his heart and imagination . Christmas is not the only thing that DICKENS discovered or rediscovered . Almost exactly one hundred years ago he began the rediscovery of the Forgotten Man . Of him CHESTERTON has said , " There can be no question of the importance of DIcicsiis as a human event in history * * * revealing a light that never was on sea or land , if only in the long fantastic shadows that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Jo and the Vincent Crummleses the English populace came on the scene .

Of 20 , - 000 persons on the force the foreign-born and sons of foreign-born parents are about 13,500 . Of these more than half are of Irish descent . But it is plain from a closer analysis that if the older Irish strains are included the Celtic representation would be still heavier . German blood is only one-third as strong as the Irish . That will probably explain why the tradition of the Irish policeman has maintained itself , while the " German cop " of a generation ago has perceptibly faded . This is the reverse of what has happened on the stage . The comic Irishman has vanished , except from the vaudeville oases .

On the one hand , we are urged to forget that there is such a thing as foreign trade ; what are a couple of billion dollars of exports more or less , anyhow ? On the other hand , we go through elaborate negotiations swapping a million dollars ' worth of table fruit for a million dollars ' worth of beverages . People who announce Something the doom of foreign to trade , the collapse of the Sell . world market , the triumph of economic nationalism , have no trouble in showing how this is bound to happen .

The smiling land of France is not self-sufficient in the matter of fruit . So perhaps the nations may yet continue to find things which they can profitably exchange among themselves , not only fruit for cotton or silk for copper , but actually fruit for fruit and one kind of silk for another kind of silk .. At least men have been exchanging such things since the dawn of history . Representative HAMILTON FISH Jr . has made a valuable contribution to the chemistry of high explosives . He warns the Republican leaders not " to supply ammunition to the Democrats by washing dirty linen in public . " " Husband Sues Company .
