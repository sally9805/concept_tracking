Last month lion-jawed Pianist Moriz Rosenthal celebrated the soth anniversary of his U. S. debut by playing a special gold-lacquered piano in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall ( TIME , Nov. 21 ) . Forgotten at the time by most Manhattan concertgoers was the fact that Pianist Rosenthal 's U. S. debut in 1888 was not a one-man show . Billed as assisting artist on that program was another U. S. debutant : a self-effacing , dark-eyed , 13-year-old Viennese violinist named Fritz Kreisler . In their excitement over Pianist Rosenthal 's galloping fingers , the Manhattan critics nearly forgot to mention Infant Prodigy Kreisler . But in the years that followed his U. S. reputation grew until he was regarded as world 's No. 1 violinist . <P> Last week Violinist Kreisler might have announced that he was commemorating the 50th anniversary of his U. S. debut . But his first Manhattan appearance of the season , which drew throngs to Carnegie Hall , was billed as just another concert . Concertgoers who went to hear him had long since ceased to expect prodigies of technique or tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an afternoon of leisurely , charming , old-school fiddling such as only Fritz Kreisler can put on . Kreisler 's playing is to the exact , nervous fiddling of today what a Kentucky colonel 's drawl is to the feverish staccato of a prizefight announcer . <P> An able pianist as well as a violinist , Fritz Kreisler is also widely known for his compositions , chief among them a sheaf of ingratiating light violin pieces ( Caprice Viennois , Tambourin Chinois , etc. ) which are played by all of today 's important fiddlers . In 1902 he married a U. S. woman , Harriet Lies , daughter of Tobacco Merchant George P. Lies . Violinist Kreisler has a belief that if one has practiced well in youth , the fingers should hold their suppleness in later years . Says Wife Harriet : " He would be a better violinist if he practiced more . "
