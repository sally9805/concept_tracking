txt MORE GLOOM IN 1781 THAN NOW , BUT THEN CAME YORKTOWN Continental Currency Worth Nothing and Victory Seemed Improbable To most Americans the year 1781 is one of glory and not one of gloom . And yet , from the firing of the first gus . at Lexington to the present day , the people of Virginia and her sister States probably have never experienced any other depression quite equal to that of the first part of that year . The glory of Yorktown has been recorded in our school histories and in a few weeks will be reflected in a sesquicentennial celebration , when hundreds of thousands win seek to stand on the spot where Lord Cornwallis tendered his sword in surrender . But to the men and women of 1931 , weary with carrying the burdens of today and well-nigh in despair , the surrender at Yorktown will be the celebration of a national triumph of the long ago rather than an encouragement to personal triumphs until they come to an intimate knowledge of the greater de-pression of 1781 , through which courageous souls fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to boom . It is interesting and encouraging to read General Washington 's diary and letters , and many letters written to him by Lafayette and others , as of that year , 150 years ago . From ' these we learn that in that year the great majority of the colonists had lost all hope of victory , that the troops under General Washington even were dispirited and dissatisfied and in some cases were in mutiny , that the currency issued by the Congress had lost all of its value , that there were no funds with which to pay the soldiers , that the army was lacking in food supplies and ammunition , that General Washington for months could not bring his troops to Virginia to support Lafayette because the means of transportation were lacking . Currency Deflated . In the early Spring of 1781 the Continental currency was worth only a fraction of its face value . A $500 bill was worth one cent . In May this currency ceased to have any value . No one would accept in payment any note or bond issued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing except specie , gold or silver , and that could be had only on the credit of individuals . Robert Morris could and did raise money to pay the troops on his personal credit when the government could get nothing on its credit . In June , 1931 , the United States Treasury offered $800,000,000 worth of bonds . In a few hours they were oversubscribed thirty times . In June , 1781 , no credit . In June , 1931 , $24 , - ) 00,000,000 immediately available . Within less than one month before the surrender at Yorktown , General Washington advised Congress that if provisions were not immediately forthcoming it would be necessary to disband the whole army . Within less than one month prior to that time General Washington wrote to Count de Grasse , in charge of the French fleet in lower Chesapeake Bay , urging that the decision to withdraw the fleet be reconsidered and countermanded and stating that if the fleet should be withdrawn the cause would be lost . Nobody saw the way out . How Washington Viewed It . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably no other one that gives such a complete picture of con- , ditions as e.oes that of May 1 . On that day he wrote as follows : Instead of having magazines filled with provisions , we have a scanty pittance scattered here and there in the different States ; instead of having our arsenals well supplied with military stores , they are poorly provided and the workmen all leaving them ; instead of having the various articles of field equipage in readiness to be delivered , the Quartermaster General , as the dernier ressort , according to his account , is but now applying to the several States to provide these things for their troops respectively ; instead of having a regular system of transportation established upon credit , or funds in the Quartermaster 's hands to defray the contingent expenses of it , we have neither the one nor the other , and all that business , or a great part of it , being done by military impress , we are daily and hourly oppressing the people , souring their tempers and alienating their affections ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which ought to have been done agreeably to the requisitions of Congress , scarce any State in the Union has at this hour an eighth part of its quota in the field , and little prospect I can see of ever getting more than half ; in a word , instead of having everything in readiness to take the field , we have nothing ; instead of having the prospect of a glorious offensive campaign before us , we have a gloomy and bewildered defensive one , unless we should receive a powerful aid of ships and troops and money from our generous allies , and these at present are too contingent to build upon . Victory Was Improbable . This is not the wail of a defeated candidate seeking to discredit the work of his political opponents . It is not the expression of opinion of a provincial 4. trlio knows little that goes on outside of his little neighnorhood . It is not the complaint of a pessimist suffering from indigestion . It is not a picture painted by one who has lost his wealth or influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell everybody where the world is wrong . It is not a story told by one who has lost faith in himself , his fellow-men and his God . This is the declaration of one who is acclaimed as the greatest man that America has ever produced ; who when he was writing it was a man of calm amidst turmoil , who was the mainstay of his discouraged countrymen . He was the same man who had prayed at Valley Forge . It was more improbable that the victory at Yorktown in October , 1781 , should follow the conditions of the preceding May than that prosperity in October , 1931 , shall follow the conditions of today . It may be that 1931 , like 1781 , will pass from one of gloom to one of glory . In the Spring of 1781 General Washington could not see the way out , but in October there was Yorktown .
