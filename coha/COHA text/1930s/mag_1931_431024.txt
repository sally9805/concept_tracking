 |p886  The Boom in English Ghosts Condensed from the Herald Tribune Magazine ( December 28 , ' 30 ) T. Porter Wood THIS season finds Britain experiencing an unparalleled boom in ghosts . Innumerable new ones are reported from all over the country while most of the established ghosts have again been on the job . Anne Boleyn has gone wailing down the corridor at Hampton Court . The little old lady in black who once frightened a man to death is haunting Rufford Abbey . In its ornamental iron case in ancient Smithhills Hall , the martyr 's footprint has been seen to bleed . Bishop Roger of Salisbury has been stalking the ruins of Sherborne Castle , as has been his wont for the last nine centuries . A domestic has caught sight of the Duchess of Mazarin , who was Charles II 's mistress , shamelessly flitting through her old apartments in St. James 's Palace , and the fearful tube ghost ( described by Swifte , Keeper of the Crown Jewels , in 1860 has eddied across a courtyard of the Tower of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rationalists explain the present epidemic by the anxiety neurosis of the island folk just now . There was a similar epidemic during the World War , when all the old ghosts began to walk and a multitude of new ones ( among them the angels of Mons ) sprang up . Spiritualists argue that when people are worried , restless , nervous , they become more sensitive to occult presences . Myself , I prefer to echo Madame de Deffand , who , when asked whether she believed in ghosts , replied : " No , but I am afraid of them . " Abandoning conjecture , let me draw you closer to these spectral corridors of ancestral mansions .. It is difficult to make a choice among so many spooks , but we might do worse than start at Windsor Castle . The story breaks last November with the screams of a housemaid in a corridor off the Blue Drawing Room . A footman came running and found the girl in a faint on the floor . When she recovered she asserted that a huge white figure had suddenly loomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went peacefully along with her duster . Some skepticism is expressed by authorities on the ground that although the King 's huge old castle is notoriously haunted , all the spooks are well known , and there is no record of an undefined shape more than life size . King Charles I and Queen Elizabeth  |p887  are the two most regular apparitions at Windsor . The late Empress Frederick has left it on record that she was reading in the library and looked up to see a Cavalier standing by her side . 1 is face , she said , bore a strong resemblance to pictures of the Stuart King who lost his head . After standing quite still beside her for a few moments , he vanished . Another frequent visitor to the castle , Princess Beatrice , aunt of the present king , on several occasions has seen the spirit of Elizabeth . Once the princess 's black cat also apparently saw the ghost , for he took sudden alarm and jumped out of a window and broke his leg . Then there is a strong rumor , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the ghost of Glamis Castle is appearing night after night . This particular ghost is in the nature of a skeleton in the cupboard of the Duchess of York 's family . Legend runs that Earl Beardie , a notorious gambler of the 15th century , lost Glamis itself to a guest at card play in the crypt , and slew him to avoid paying . Something thereupon happened , the exact nature of which is known , generation after generation , to only three people : the living Earl of Strathmore , his heir , and the steward of the castle . Legend again has it that on a certain night each year , these three men visit the crypt and there witness Earl Beardie replaying that card game . If there is anything in the story which excited the Village of Glamis , the spectral Earl Beardie has mixed up his dates , got tired of the crypt and started flitting about other parts of the castle . The tales that came into London newspaper offices over the wires from Scotland were followed by news which took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabethan mansion of the old Boynton family in Yorkshire , where there is kept in a glass case in the entrance hall a skull supposed to be that of a former female member of the family . The lady suffered a terrible wrong some 300 years ago , and insisted that until she was avenged her skull should adorn the entrance hall . Later a skeptical Boynton had the skull buried in the garden . That night , screams from the hall ! The household rushed down . There lay the skull in the middle of the floor . The frightened head of the house humored it by restoring it to its proper place . The present story is that the skull has been screaming again , but why , no one seems to know . Two of Henry VIII 's wives , Catherine Howard and Jane Seymour , regularly haunt Hampton Court . Both have appeared this month , while Anne Boleyn , who  |p888  was beheaded , has been seen no less than four times . The last person who claims to have seen her was discovered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police . He said he was a spiritualist who had secreted himself in the palace , and that he had seen Anne and was interrupted just as he was going to talk to her . Among some dozen other new apparitions is that of the Rev. Norbert Wylie , who died two years ago . A host of witnesses testify to having seen his ghost in the Holy Cross Priory in Leicester , and Father Fabian Dix , the present prior , saw the apparition himself and heard it speak . From the fox-hunting districts come several new ghosts , among them a phantom horse , an Eye of Doom in a vague vast shape hovering over tombstones in an old churchyard , and a glimmering white hand which has taken to drifting about a squire 's house and has sent a well known hunting woman into hysterics . An instance of the aimlessness of this season 's ghosts is the brown monk of the Seaforth clan of Scotland . He was definitely reported in December as seen by villagers near the stream which turns muddy when a Seaforth is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seaforths ( the the Mackensies ; the Seaforth tit ! came later ) fell afoul of the Church and got cursed.The brown monk who laid the cur said that there should come a de head of the clan and , contemporary with him , four great lair with marked physical defects and that when this happened the family 's land would be lost an the line become extinct . Centuries passed . Then the 21st chief of the Mackensies , who had been created Lord Seaforth lost his four sons and , owing t speculation , got his estate hope lessly involved . It was then realized that the curse was coming literally true . For Lord Seaforth was deaf , and four of his contemporaries bore marked physical defects . One stammered , one was buck-toothed , one hair-lipped and one half-witted . Sir Walter Scott dug up the curse and authenticated it at the time . It is a question what the recent apparition of the brown monk portends , since the last Lord Seaforth died in 1923 . One can only surmise that the brown monk has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a habit , or else that the news service of the spirit world is defective .
