I Must Love Someone ( by Jack Kirkland &; Leyla Georgie ; produced by Jack Kirkland ) tells of six fly young ladies who , at the turn of the century , made up a Florodora Sextet. * In Act I , along with six swains , they render Tell Me , Pretty Maiden quite fetchingly ; then for the rest of the show they gallivant with various admirers whose attentions go considerably beyond candy , books and flowers . One Pretty Maiden goes in for blackmail ; another enjoys watching her aged suitor tumble down a flight of steps ; a third is kept by a pal of the Mayor 's ; a fourth gets a venereal disease from her lover and shoots him . <P> It is the authors ' fond hope , in portraying such girlish fun , " to capture the spirit of New York 's glittering and legendary years . " To their idyllic plot they have added an atmosphere as romantic as a pair of handcuffs , a sty's-the-limit vulgarity . To those who were not of theatre age in 1900 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sextet included such glamor girls of the past as Red Light Annie , Chicago May and Lizzie Borden . <P> Mrs. O'Brien Entertains ( by Harry Madden ; produced by George Abbott ) but she is not very entertaining . Snooting the century-ago Irish immigrants who fill her house , and sneering at all foreigners who are non-Irish , she is finally read a lecture on Americanism and the melting pot , quickly mends her ways . The play is well-meaning , noisy , false : the Maggie and Jiggs set transferred from comic strip to stage . <P> <P> *During Florodora 's original Manhattan run of 547 performances , at least 79 girls appeared at different times in the famed Sextet.
