Tovarich ( by Jacques Deval , adapted by Robert Emmet Sherwood ; Gilbert Miller , producer ) has in the past three years won acclaim in 24 European cities , where it has been played 15,000 times . This would argue that mankind , in the theatre , remains incorrigibly reactionary , for Tovarich is a pleasant , sentimental , old-fashioned comedy whose theme concerns the dignity with which two impoverished members of the Russian nobility undertake menial work to make a living . Tried &; true though the material may be , no show of Tovarich 's type was ever presented with more grace and humor . <P> Most of Tovarich 's grace can be attributed to the pair who impersonate the reduced Russians , a U. S. citizen named John Halliday and an Italian citizen named Marta Abba . Actor Halliday gives an excellent performance as Prince Mikail , the gentle and gallant ex-officer of the Tsar who was entrusted by his sovereign with 4,000,000,000 gold francs just before the fall of the Winter Palace . The money was to be used , at the Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Years later , Prince Mikail is living in a Paris garret , down to his last 100-franc note and about to be dispossessed , but with the Tsar 's 4,000,000,000 francs still intact . " Oh God , " he tells his wife from the depths of a large , soiled bed , " it is good to be Russian ! We are so sad ! " His wife , the Grand Duchess Tatiana ( Marta Abba ) , is no less indomitable . She steals food from the neighborhood grocer with a facility which can be explained only by the fact that God is a Russian . When this tattered and charming couple learn that the French Government , not God , has been averting the eyes of the groceryman , Prince and Grand Duchess go into service as butler and maid to a banker 's family . <P> The humor in the English version of Tovarich , first written in French by the author of Her Cardboard Lover , is supplied by one of the surest writers of comedy on the U. S. stage , Robert Sherwood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble folk ( Idiot 's Delight , Reunion in Vienna ) , he has not failed to exploit the full nostalgia of the Prince 's and Duchess ' pre-War glory , to contrast their conduct with that of their employers , and to point up the play 's one sombre occurrence : the reunion between the nobles and Red Tovarich ( Comrade ) Gorotchenko , who once violated the Grand Duchess and who now wants her husband to give him the Tsar 's gold to save Russia 's oil fields from foreign development . Spectators may anticipate a happy ending . Producer Miller ( Victoria Regina ) may expect the golden fruit of another of his polite , well-mounted , well-deserved successes .
