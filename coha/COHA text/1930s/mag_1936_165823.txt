While British newsorgans of Leftist and Liberal persuasion were crying out against " the outrageous powers over life and death " entrusted by His Majesty 's Government to masterful Lieutenant General John Greer Dill , Military Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Palestine , the General himself was demonstrating how effective those powers could be . Last week under the watchful eyes of British Tommies , Arab shops which had been closed for 26 weeks during the paralyzing Arab General Strike ( TIME , May 4 et seq. ) displayed their wares , and Arab women thankfully began to shop again in comfort . Arab-operated taxis and buses were laboriously cranked up and put back on the streets . Village peasant women , without fear of molestation , lugged baskets of fruit and vegetables to be sold in nearby towns . <P> Candid General Dill , who well knows that the Arabs still hate the Jews as much as ever , was not deceived into thinking that the suspension of the strike marked the end of Arab-Jewish hostilities . Not Arab benevolence but British might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Dill : " The decision of the Arab higher committee was almost entirely due to the resolute and energetic action of the British forces .
