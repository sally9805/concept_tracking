Time : The present . After five  --  an afternoon in spring . Place : A wide balcony built at the back of a second story apartment in West Tenth Street  --  New York . A narrow iron railing runs around the balcony  --  a gay striped awning is over it  --  wicker chairs are on it  --  and the tops of a few trees are outside  --  suggesting the height . At Curtain : JIMMIE LEE and MARY HOWARD are on the balcony  --  relaxed with spring laziness  --  cigarettes and cocktails . MARY is an extremely pretty woman about thirty-two . Her spring clothes are smart and alluring . JIMMIE is perhaps thirty-eight  --  plain almost to homeliness  --  but with a smile which makes him almost good looking . His clothes are right but careless in effect  --  and there is a general air of unorthodoxness about him which can afford to be as it is because of JIMMIE 'S great likeableness . HOWARD ( as the curtain rises ) If you 'd face the fact that we 're not going to marry each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to marry me you mean . p. 3 HOWARD You 'd get over me  --  and fall in love with somebody else after awhile . LEE ( putting his head back against his chair ) Yeah ? HOWARD You know it 's true . Why are n't you honest about it ? LEE Why be honest in spring ? Gosh this is nice Mary ! Give me New York ! A back yard in West Tenth Street is just as good as The Chestnuts in Paris . Better  --  not so much trouble to get here . HOWARD ( filling JIMMIE 'S cocktail glass ) That 's it Jimmie . You 're too lazy to give me up . I 'm a habit with you . Here  --  take this . LEE ( taking the glass slowly ) If I 'd rather stick around you  --  knowing you 're not going to marry me  --  than some other woman who 'd give her eyebrows for me  --  that 's my business . N'est-ce-pas ? HOWARD But you  --  LEE Unless  --  ( Looking at her keenly . ) Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there some new reason ? HOWARD I mean a girl Jimmie  --  someone younger who would be romantic about you  --  and think you 're wonderful . That 's what you need to really make you happy . p. 4 LEE To really make me sick  --  you mean . What could be more nauseating than somebody around who 's damn fool enough to think you 're better than you are ? HOWARD You ought to be better than you are . LEE What 's the use ? You would n't marry me if I was  --  were . Dragging himself up on to the arm of his chair and leaning over the railing . HOWARD You have n't a grain of ambition . It 's all too easy for you . I mean the way you write  --  the way you ride  --  the way you shoot . You do n't try . You just do it . You do n't live up to yourself  --  what you might be . LEE ( throwing himself back in his chair ) That 's one of your greatest charms old girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me very much indeed . HOWARD ( putting her chin against the railing and looking down into the garden ) You deserve more than liking Jimmie . LEE Liking is the greatest human relationship . It outlasts everything else . HOWARD I wonder if you 're capable of a great passion . p. 5 LEE God I hope not . HOWARD What ? LEE They always blow up . HOWARD ( after a moment ) Did you see the new iris ? The black ones ? LEE ( without moving ) Black ? Where ? HOWARD Down there  --  in with the ferns . They 're very rare  --  and hard to get . LEE I 'm glad of that . I like the old purple ones best . HOWARD Look Jimmie please . LEE ( leaning over the railing ) Swell ! You 're a wizard Mary  --  to turn a back yard into that . It puts up a darn sight better show than Mrs. Guinness ' over there  --  and she 's spent real money on hers . Kind of sore about yours  --  she is . HOWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden ) Well  --  there it is  --  and what of it ? LEE ( watching her closely ) Wo n't do ? ( She shakes her head . ) Not the swell little flat inside  --  nor the people chasing you  --  eating out of your hand  --  not even your damned success you 're so cocky about ? Not enough ? ( She shakes her head . ) Only a woman for a man  --  and a man for a woman  --  no matter how much of everything else we 've got . It 's true  --  and it 's hell . ( He leans back in his chair again . ) But you 're so rotten choosy Mary . You expect a man to be as exactly the way you want him  --  as you do the back yard and everything else you manipulate . p. 6 HOWARD Oh  --  I do n't . LEE Certainly you do  --  hand picked and interior decorated and all the rest of it . No man on earth could live up to what you expect . HOWARD That is n't true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't if  --  LEE If what ? HOWARD If I fell in love . LEE And the harder it hit you the more you 'd hate him when it was over . HOWARD But it would n't be over  --  if it really happened . LEE It 's always over . That 's why I say liking 's the greatest  --  why I 've seen you get sick of somebody like that  --  ( Snapping his fingers. ) right under your nose while he 's talking to you . Somebody you 've been all het up about  --  and all of a sudden  --  bing  --  you 're through . The way he sits  --  or his shoes  --  or the way he eats his soup  --  HOWARD ( smiling affectionately at JIMMIE ) Or his voice . p. 7 LEE Oh God yes  --  the voice ! Many a poor fool has lost you because he would n't take voice lessons . HOWARD ( laughing softly ) Ears are the worst of all . That 's one thing that makes you last so long Jimmie . Your ears are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every time I see you now I 'll think Good God how are my ears today ? HOWARD You 're sweet Jimmie . I wish I were in love with you . I do love you . LEE Try me  --  then if you do n't want me  --  I 'll get out . You 've got yourself in this damned snooty  --  HOWARD You do n't know anything about me  --  really . LEE Do n't I ! HOWARD Just because I have n't happened to know the right man  --  does n't mean there is n't one . Oh  --  it 's all so  --  When the right people do find  --  She checks herself . LEE It 's all wrong  --  un ? HOWARD I do n't know what I was going to say . p. 8 LEE Have you found him ? HOWARD I have n't found anything . Except to know that I have n't got anything that really counts . Nobody belongs to me  --  nobody whose very existence depends on me . I am completely and absolutely alone . LEE It 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something we ca n't help . If nothing comes that completes us  --  what can we do ? LEE ( after a pause  --  rising and moving to the Left ) Woodruf 's married  --  is n't he ? HOWARD What ? Rogers Woodruf ? LEE Yes  --  that 's his name  --  not Jake or Clarence  --  Rogers . There is a Mrs. is n't there ? HOWARD Why yes I s'pose so . Yes I 'm sure there is . LEE Never 've seen her ? HOWARD No . Why ? LEE I just wondered . ( JIMMIE whistles . MARY hums . ) When 's your book coming out ? HOWARD ( lighting a cigarette with elaborate carelessness ) You know  --  perfectly well . p. 9 LEE ( moving closer to MARY ) I s'pose Woodruf tells you it 's the best thing you 've done . HOWARD No he does n't . Yes  --  he does . Everybody  --  but you will think so . LEE It 's funny to me that as big a publisher as Woodruf would n't know it 's artificial stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why do you say that Jimmie ? LEE I s'pose he tells you everything you do is great . HOWARD Of course he does n't . He 's very critical  --  in a constructive way . LEE You never listen to anything I say . HOWARD You never like anything I do . LEE Your first stuff was as real as that crooked tree . It was alive because it was about something you know something about . HOWARD You mean to say this is n't ? LEE You do n't know anything more about men than  --  But the stinking thing is you have n't even got your woman right . p. 10 HOWARD ( with growing excitement ) That 's just what I have done . LEE Do you mean to say a decent woman would take a man away from his wife ? HOWARD She does n't . It was over for them before she even  --  LEE I bet the wife did n't know it was over . HOWARD He never did love the wife the way he 's capable of loving . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . LEE You do n't say ! HOWARD Well if I do n't know these people who does ? LEE You made ' em up . Manufactured the situation . It is n't true . That kind of a woman does n't fool around with a married man . HOWARD You do n't even know what it 's about  --  that kind of love . It made her too . Changed them both from just people  --  into something fine . LEE All right  --  I grant you they both might be hit right in the snoot with it . The woman might think she had to have him or bust  --  but when it came right down to going to bed with him  --  no  --  she wouldn't. p. 11 HOWARD You do n't know any more about women than  --  LEE I know a damned sight more than you do . HOWARD Do n't be silly . LEE Certainly I do . I know all kinds  --  good and bad  --  straight and loose . Some of the loose ones are the best ever  --  because they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't she 's the worst kind of a  --  HOWARD You put them in pigeon holes and tab them  --  a man 's idea of women . There are just as many reasons and conditions for women as there are for men . LEE Nope ! If a woman 's good  --  she 's good  --  and if she is n't  --  she is n't . HOWARD That 's the greatest bunk in the world . It 's just what the book is about . You do n't even get it  --  Damn you ! Getting out of her chair and moving to the Right . LEE Well  --  would you do it ? HOWARD ( after a pause  --  her back turned to JIMMIE ) Do what ? LEE What she does in your book . p. 12 HOWARD I ca n't talk to you about it Jimmie  --  because that kind of love  --  LEE ( with ironical eloquence ) The kind that makes the music of the spheres  --  HOWARD Is n't in your ken  --  at all . LEE ( going closer to MARY ) Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Man is a very law abiding animal when it comes to decent women . He wants a decent woman to stay decent  --  and if she does n't he cusses her out for doing the very thing he told her was the greatest thing a woman can do  --  giving him all for love . If your woman did what you make her do the man would be so damned sick of her after while he 'd want to shoot her . God  --  I 've persuaded so many women and hated ' em afterwards ! Walking away . HOWARD You 're talking about common  --  sordid  --  LEE ( going back to her ) I 'm talking about men  --  as is  --  and if Woodruf 's told you you 've got the man right in your book he 's a damned liar . A piano is heard from inside the apartment . Someone is playing popular music very well. p. 13 HOWARD That 's Walter . Bridget 's here . Hello ! Come out  --  Bridgie . LEE Bridget and her little lamb ! Ca n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOWARD Shut up . MARY sits again in the same chair  --  after BRIDGET comes out on to the balcony . MRS . DRAKE ( appearing in the doorway ) I knew you were here Jimmie . Hello . I saw your car outside . Warm is n't it ? Actually hot . Things are sticking to me . Hello Mary . ( MRS . BRIDGET DRAKE is probably more than forty  --  but does n't look it . She is small  --  round and rather pretty . Her crinkled blonde hair is sticking out from a very coquettish little hat  --  and keeps getting in her near-sighted eyes  --  which she squints as she looks at things . She is frankly made up and her clothes are extremely chic . She speaks in a quick sputtering sort of way  --  knowing as well as anyone else she is n't saying anything . ) How sweet this is ! Why have n't I got one ? I would n't dare live way down here . Nobody would ever come to see me . It 's bad enough on Sixtieth Street  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will I stick to that Jimmie ? Pointing to a chair at Left. p. 14 LEE ( spreading his handkerchief on the chair ) You know better than I do how sticky you are . MANNERS ( coming into the doorway ) Hello Mary . WALTER MANNERS is thirty  --  good looking  --  well dressed  --  and a trifle languid in manner . HOWARD Hello Walter . JIMMIE AND WALTER How are you ? MANNERS New chairs Mary ? HOWARD Yes . How 's Bridgie 's house coming Walter ? I can hardly wait to see what you 've done with it . MANNERS ( strolling to the Right corner of the balcony ) Considering what she bought in one of her most buying moments  --  it 's turned out pretty well . MRS . DRAKE It 's unbelievable what he 's done . In fact I think it 's the best thing you 've ever done  --  darling . MANNERS Gosh  --  I 'd hate to think that . LEE When am I going to see it Bridgie ? MRS . DRAKE Right away .  --  You ca n't guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bell  --  will you Jimmie ? You do n't want tea do you Bridgie ? MRS . DRAKE I do not . I 'm not as old as that . When do you work Jimmie ? LEE I do n't . Why do n't I go and shake up the cocktails ? MRS . DRAKE Oh do n't go Jimmie . You do it Walter . MANNERS I 'm busy . Let me know when you 've done ' em Jimmie . WALTER goes into the house  --  and plays again after a moment . MRS . DRAKE I say you ca n't guess what we 've been doing . LEE ( looking down at BRIDGET with dry amusement ) You and Walter ? MRS . DRAKE Yes . LEE I thought that 's what we were n't supposed to guess . MRS . DRAKE ( laughing ) I do n't see why you say that . We 've been looking at pictures in McDougal Alley . I said " Well  --  now that we have come as far as this we might as well go all the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to Walter ? p. 16 MRS . DRAKE About the pictures  --  idiot . LEE Oh . MRS . DRAKE But we laughed so at one that we simply had to come out . Walter said it was a naked soul in paint  --  and I said  --  She shrieks with laughter . MANNERS ( calling from inside ) I know what you 're laughing at . MRS . DRAKE I ca n't tell them now what I said in cold blood Walter . It just came out impulsively  --  before I thought  --  but that is just exactly what it does look like . Oh I had luncheon with Laura Mills yesterday and I bet it 's true . LEE What ? MRS . DRAKE She and Phil Lawrence . I never believed it before  --  actually  --  but I do now . LEE Why now ? Does she look guilty ? MRS . DRAKE On the contrary she looks like the cat that swallowed the canary . It 's just a kind of a subtle something . You can always tell when a woman really has  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make the cocktails . p. 17 LEE ( about to sit near BRIDGET ) I do n't want to leave now . HOWARD Take this stuff away  --  please dear . I do n't know what 's the matter in the kitchen . What 's that Walter ? She sings what WALTER is playing . LEE ( as he goes out with the tray with a mincing step ) Walter 's playing awfully well this spring  --  is n't he ? MRS . DRAKE ( rising and going to the railing ) Do you want me to ask Jimmie up for this weekend ? HOWARD Why Jimmie ? I see him every day . MRS . DRAKE Well  --  who then ? HOWARD Anybody you want of course  --  but if there is n't anybody in particular  --  you might  --  I was just thinking  --  MRS . DRAKE What ? HOWARD I do n't believe I can go myself unless  --  MRS . DRAKE Unless what ? HOWARD I have to re-write one chapter . I could do it at your house if  --  p. 18 MRS . DRAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do it up there if you asked Mr. Woodruf too . Rogers Woodruf . That might be a good idea . I just thought of it . If he 'd come  --  of course . I have to do the work with him . MRS . DRAKE Ask him without his wife ? HOWARD What 's that got to do with it ? It 's business . MRS . DRAKE Yes I know . But who else shall I ask ? I do n't know anybody decent enough to have in the house and at the same time broadminded enough to think it 's all right to just have you and  --  You 're sure you do n't want Jimmie too  --  for looks ? HOWARD Good heavens no ! Why have anybody else ? I 'll have to work all the time anyway . MRS . DRAKE ( moving to the table ) Yes I know . That 's what I say is the part I do n't understand . If women do have lovers  --  nice women I mean  --  where do they go ? HOWARD What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to say you can do as you please in your own house  --  but the servants ! I 'd be more embarrassed with my own servants than any  --  How a nice woman can sneak and lie and run around to queer places  --  I honestly think the only happy women in the world are the ones who positively hate men . After all what do you get out of them but downright misery ? The music has stopped . WALTER comes into the doorway. p. 19 MANNERS What are you two talking about ? MRS . DRAKE Go play that again please Walter . MANNERS I want to come out . MRS . DRAKE No ! Play it once more . There 's a dear . Go on . I do love it so  --  please dear . WALTER goes back . HOWARD And why are you saying all that stuff to me  --  pray ? MRS . DRAKE ( going to the Right corner of the balcony ) What stuff ? I 'm not saying anything . I do n't mind just having Woodruf and you  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it from looking  --  you know . HOWARD I do not know . What are you talking about ? It 's business . MRS . DRAKE Yes I know . Do you like this hat ? HOWARD ( looking over her shoulder at BRIDGET who is back of her ) I like it if you want to look like a tart . MRS . DRAKE Well I do . Walter says it 's much too old and severe for me . ( WALTER 'S music is heard again . ) I hope Woodruf can come this week end . I 've asked people for the next . If he ca n't I s'pose I can switch ' em . p. 20 HOWARD Do n't bother . It does n't matter one way or the other . I merely thought it would be nice to do the work in the country instead of in town . Forget it . MRS . DRAKE You 're so heavy Mary . HOWARD What ? MRS . DRAKE If you were perfectly frank about it nobody would think anything about it . HOWARD You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about . Rogers Woodruf ? Just because he publishes my books  --  and I see him occasionally ? What do you take me for Bridgie ?  --  He 's a married man ! MRS . DRAKE Of course he is . The good ones always are . Somebody has always beaten you to it . Going back to the table . HOWARD You 're imbecile Bridgie ! Where in the name of heaven did you get such an idea ? MRS . DRAKE ( carefully renewing her powder and lip rouge ) I have n't any idea . I 'm merely saying he 's a terribly attractive man who seems to drop in here terribly often and life is flying by  --  terribly fast  --  and after all  --  why not ? MARY laughs again and stops suddenly  --  standing up. p. 21 HOWARD Now listen Bridgie . I know you do n't mean a word you 're saying  --  but do n't babble on like that to other people . Everybody does n't know me as well as you do . MRS . DRAKE ( standing by the railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course  --  but after all why control yourself ? Nobody else does . Why be a Queen Mary in this day and age ? Where does it get you ? I know I 'm a fool to be so decent  --  about Walter . Everybody else is doing exactly as they please . Why should n't I ? But I do n't . And the funny part of it is I actually do n't know whether it 's because I 'm too good  --  or because I have n't got the nerve . HOWARD Bridgie you 're a scream . MRS . DRAKE I tell you this is an awfully hard age for a good woman to live in . I mean one who wants to have any fun . If you 've still got the instincts for right and wrong that were pounded into you when you were a girl  --  what are you going to do with ' em ? Nobody else seems to have ' em . And they just get you mixed up  --  and hold you back  --  so you 're neither one thing nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contented . You 're just discontentedly decent  --  and it does n't get you anywhere . p. 22 HOWARD Oh Bridgie I love you ! You 're an adorable idiot . MRS . DRAKE And you 're not getting any younger as the years roll by darling . Even Jimmie will see that  --  after awhile  --  and if you think this man is the big thing in life and do n't grab him  --  you 're a fool . HOWARD Shut up Bridget . You 're talking absolute rot and you 've made it up . What put such an idea in your head ? MRS . DRAKE Nothing put anything in my head . ( Looking critically at the rouge on her lips . ) This is n't so good in the daylight  --  is it ? I mean after all you never saw his wife . It is n't as though she were one of your friends . They say she 's a dub . HOWARD Who says so ? MRS . DRAKE I do n't know . An intellectual dub  --  just what you 'd expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help that . And do n't be a crusader Mary . Do n't poke around and find out too much . Just take him while you 've got him . After all if people stop to investigate  --  nobody would ever marry anybody . There 's always insanity or tuberculosis if you look far enough . Irene 's just found out there 's epilepsy in the Stuart family  --  and now of course she 's waiting for Harry to throw a fit any minute  --  but she says they 've had three awfully happy years if he does . MARY shouts with laughter. p. 23 MRS . DRAKE What 'll we do if Woodruf ca n't come ? HOWARD Ask him . MRS . DRAKE When ? HOWARD Well  --  he  --  may possibly come in this afternoon  --  about the jacket . MRS . DRAKE What jacket ? HOWARD Cover  --  for my book . That 's what they call it . MRS . DRAKE ( sitting in JIMMIE 'S chair at Left ) Oh  --  I thought maybe he was buying you a fur coat or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass . If he does come  --  do n't let Jimmie hear you ask him . Not that it matters a hang  --  but do n't let Jimmie hear you in case you have to ask Jimmie after all . See ? MRS . DRAKE ( poking at her hair and hat ) No I do n't  --  yes I do ! HOWARD Get Woodruf in the other room to ask him  --  and then after that  --  take Jimmie away with you  --  so Mr. Woodruf and I can get at  --  our  --  the work . Jimmie takes up so much room . Take him away  --  will you ? Going down to the Right corner. p. 24 MRS . DRAKE You expect me to do the most impossible  --  HOWARD Hello . As ROGERS WOODRUF comes into the doorway . ROGERS Hello . Hello Mrs. Drake . You look like Spring herself . BRIDGET puts out her left hand to ROGERS as he goes to the Left corner . MRS . DRAKE Oh  --  hello Mr. Woodruf . Well  --  this is a surprise .

Will you come  --  sometime I mean ? I 've taken an old place . It might amuse you to see it . ROGERS Ask me and see . MRS . DRAKE I am asking you . Which is better for you this one or next ? p. 25 ROGERS Any one you say . MRS . DRAKE Are you sure ? ROGERS Of course I 'm sure .

HOWARD That you 're here . Go away . LEE ( coming back with the tray of cocktails ) The new maid is a peach Mary . Good afternoon Woodruf .

I 'll get hold of Bix tomorrow  --  if you 're going to be in town  --  Well  --  as I say  --  Goodbye . He goes out after the others. p. 32 HOWARD ( after a pause ) I adore Jimmie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s'pose I ought to . ROGERS But you wo n't . HOWARD ( going to Woodruf to take his glass ) Perhaps not  --  now . ROGERS What does  --  now  --  mean ? HOWARD I give you one guess . ROGERS How much does that mean ? HOWARD ( kneeling in the large chair  --  back of which WOODRUF is standing ) I do n't know . ROGERS I wait for this all day  --  and get here  --  and you do n't tell me anything . HOWARD We 'll talk  --  after while . Not now . ROGERS It 's always  --  not now . HOWARD But after dinner I am going to say something to you . ROGERS ( leaning to her over the back of the chair ) Say it now . HOWARD No . Let 's just be happy  --  out here  --  now . See the new leaves coming out on that old  --  p. 33 ROGERS You 're not going to make me unhappy . You 're not going to say anything foolish  --  HOWARD Wait  --  ROGERS Because if you are  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROGERS How lovely you are ! You 're always a thousand times more so than I 've thought you were  --  all day . HOWARD And you 're always a thousand times more wonderful than I knew you were  --  all day . ROGERS I say  --  " She ca n't be as perfect as I think she is "  --  and I get here  --  and there you are  --  all over again  --  every time . HOWARD And I say  --  " Does he know so much  --  and understand everything I say  --  before I say it ? " ROGERS And I say  --  " The corners of her lips ca n't be like that "  --  and I come  --  and  --  He bends close to her . HOWARD ( holding her head back  --  away from him ) And I 'm very strong and say very intelligent things to you  --  and when you get here  --  I 'm just a fool . p. 34 ROGERS I adore you . What is it you 're going to say to me ? HOWARD ( getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to talk  --  after a while . ROGERS I 'm only going to say the same old thing . ROGERS goes towards MARY as the CURTAIN falls . The CURTAIN remains down for one minute  --  indicating the passing of about five hours. p. 35 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONE Scene II ROGERS is standing on the balcony . MARY is inside singing a love song . She finishes the song and after a moment comes onto the balcony . She has changed to a very simple white evening frock . She goes to stand beside ROGERS at the railing . ROGERS It 's the first time you 've hedged or talked platitudes . HOWARD You say platitudes because I 've been saying true things . ROGERS I thought you 'd walk right up to this and face it like a man . HOWARD That 's just what I have done . ROGERS All right  --  you say we ought to stop now . We ought not to destroy anything . What if we do stop  --  right now ? What if I never saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we could n't do it . Of course we could . And what would that destroy ? HOWARD I wish she hated you  --  or were rotten to you  --  then we would n't be hurting anybody . I ca n't let you get a divorce . ROGERS What 's it going to hurt if you chuck me ? What would that do to us ? p. 36 HOWARD I keep putting myself in her place . ROGERS You do n't think I could go on in the old way with her now  --  do you ? HOWARD Yes  --  but if it had n't been for me  --  you would have . ROGERS Oh  --  " if " ! Yes  --  if it were n't for you I suppose she and I would have made a fairly smooth finish of it . But here you are . The whole business of living at all has changed . HOWARD Yes  --  but  --  ROGERS Well  --  but ? HOWARD Did n't you feel exactly this way about  --  her  --  once ? ROGERS No . It was one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOWARD And the children . I keep thinking of them . How old are they ? ROGERS Billy 's seven and Suzan 's five . What of it ? ( Moving away to the Right and then turning toward MARY . ) Now see here Mary  --  you 've let me come as far as this .  --  You knew where we 'd land . What do you want ? What are you going to do ? p. 37 HOWARD This . We 're going to stay just as we are  --  friends . ROGERS We 're not friends . HOWARD We can be . We 'll have to be . I need you so much Rogers I can make myself your friend  --  rather than give you up . And oh  --  oh  --  oh you do n't know what that means !  --  It will be infinitely easier for you . You 're a man . You have heaps of other things  --  lots of things in your life . You 'll get used to it . ROGERS You 're talking hot air and you know it . HOWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair at Right  --  his back toward MARY . HOWARD It 's all my fault anyway . I had no business to let it get as far as this . We were just friends in the beginning . We can go back to that . At least we can go on working together . ( MARY sits in the chair by the railing at Left . ROGERS lights a cigarette . ) Thanks a lot for putting the black line around the jacket . I think it has a lot more style . Do n't you ?  --  Do n't you ? ( ROGERS does n't answer . ) And I 'll go right at the last chapter in the morning . I know you 're right about it . ( Another pause . ) How quiet it is down here ! Amazing is n't it ? Just the faintest little roar . I s'pose it 's late . After twelve is n't it ?  --  Do n't you suppose ? p. 38 ROGERS I suppose so . HOWARD ( trying to keep the tears out of her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll have something done for you to criticise when you come . Remember it 's the last turn that 's confusing  --  by the little red house  --  but I 'll write it all out . Say goodnight now Roge . ROGERS ( standing up ) I 'm not going to the country . HOWARD What ? ROGERS There 's no half way about it for me . If you can go on that way  --  then the whole thing does n't mean a damn to you . He goes to the door . HOWARD Roge  --  do n't go like that . ROGERS I 've got to go  --  like this . HOWARD ( rising ) You ca n't . ROGERS Is this all it is to you ? Have you been making a fool of me ? HOWARD Listen  --  Rogers  --  ROGERS We 've said everything on earth there is to say . p. 39 HOWARD It 's so hard dear . Ca n't you see ? ROGERS I see I love you . HOWARD ( turning to the railing ) It is n't so easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) We love each other . What difference does anything else on earth make ? Are you a coward  --  after all ? HOWARD Do n't say that to me . ROGERS You do n't love me . HOWARD Darling do n't . I love you . ROGERS If you did you would n't hesitate one second . Mary  --  dearest  --  I worship you . If you loved me  --  like that  --  you 'd take me . HOWARD Rogers  --  listen . I 'd give my soul if I were standing beside you like this  --  forever  --  never to be alone again . It 's the aloneness that frightens me . You do n't know  --  you ca n't even guess . All my life  --  even when I was so little I did n't know what it meant  --  I was lonely . And into that terrible emptiness you came . Oh God ! Oh God !  --  Oh God ! How can it be wrong !  --  Anything so right ! What shall I do ? What shall I do ? ROGERS catches her in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with her arms about his neck ) Tell me it 's right , dear . Tell me it 's right ! ROGERS If you love me it 's the rightest thing on earth . Do n't send me away now  --  dearest . Let me stay . HOWARD My life belongs to me  --  does n't it ? If I only hurt myself it does n't matter . I surely have a right to love you . I ca n't help it . I ca n't give you up Rogers . I simply can not do it . A soft whistle is heard . LEE ( calling from the garden below ) Are you there Mary ? If you are I 'm coming up . ( MARY and ROGERS move apart . MARY goes to Center . ROGERS to the Left corner . Sitting on the railing . ) I have n't shinnied up a tree for many a day . Steady old man . Wow ! There goes a garter . I bet Romeo did n't wear ' em . One more pull and I 'm over the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right end of the balcony . ) Hello ! How are you ? Hello Woodruf  --  HOWARD Hello Jimmie  --  What on earth are you  --  p. 41 LEE I 've been dining at Mrs. Guinness ' . ( He puts one leg over the railing . ) I saw your light and came through the community gardens . What ? What ? ( Putting the other leg over . He is in full evening dress . ) Very nifty party  --  tails and all . Formal as hell . I told the butler to put my hat and coat in my car out front . I 'll have plenty of room for you this time Woodruf  --  if that means anything to you . ( Having restored his garter and his tie  --  he looks at MARY and ROGERS . ) Lord  --  I hope I 'm not butting in . Have n't you finished with the book jacket yet ? Excuse me . Must be some jacket . We work fast on the paper . Have to . Everything would be cold if we did n't . Shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait at all . Shall I skip ? HOWARD Of course not . Do n't be silly Jimmie . It 's all decided . Going down to the railing at Center . LEE ( going to WOODRUF ) That 's good . Have you got a cigarette Woodruf ? I must have dropped the bloody case in the thicket so to speak . ( ROGERS gives him a cigarette . ) Thanks . Get somebody to look for it in the morning  --  will you Mary ? It 's the swell one you gave me . I 'd hate like the devil to lose it . p. 42 HOWARD Yes  --  I will . I 'll have one too  --  if you do n't mind . LEE Oh  --  sorry ! ( Holding WOODRUF 'S cigarette case to MARY  --  and then giving it back to him . ) Yes  --  yes  --  it was a party . ( WOODRUF holds his lighter to JIMMIE 'S cigarette . ) Oh  --  by the way  --  your wife was there Woodruf . ( The lighter goes out . WOODRUF flashes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  charming woman . Want a light Mary ? ( Taking WOODRUF 'S lighter  --  JIMMIE lights MARY 'S cigarette . ) I say  --  charming woman ! Mrs. Guinness said you must have forgotten to come . Your place was empty . Giving the lighter back to WOODRUF . ROGERS Oh  --  was this the night ?  --  I thought it was tomorrow . Well I 'm always glad to forget one of Mrs. Guinness 's dinners  --  both before and after . LEE This one was n't so bad  --  if you like that kind . One old dame got tight in her black velvet and that helped a lot . She took a great fancy to me . HOWARD I expect she did . p. 43 LEE Invited me to go home with her in fact . That 's one of the reasons I escaped through the garden . HOWARD You fool Jimmie ! LEE Too bad you were n't there Mary . Your hostess said you turned her down at the last minute . I got through pretty well because I was next to your wife at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting on the arm of the chair at Right . LEE When I found out who she was I went very highbrow  --  trying to live up to her  --  till I saw she was bored stiff  --  so I shot a joke or two at her  --  and she laughed  --  right out loud at the party . HOWARD Anybody have a drink ? LEE Personally I do n't need one . HOWARD So I see ! ROGERS I must go . I have no idea what time it is . LEE Do n't let me hurry you . I 've got all the time there is . ROGERS ( stopping in the doorway ) We 're all set then  --  Miss Howard ? You know exactly what you 're going to do  --  with that situation ? p. 44 HOWARD Absolutely ! ROGERS Good night then . HOWARD Good night  --  Mr. Woodruf . ROGERS goes . LEE ( calling after him ) Hold on  --  I 'm with you .  --  I got hold of Bix . He 's keen to see you . He 'll phone you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up in the morning and if I ca n't get tickets for that show  --  we 'll try another one .  --  All right ? Good night . Sorry I have to hurry off like this . O  --  well as I say  --  good night . JIMMIE goes . MARY stares after him as  --  THE CURTAIN FALLS @x Place : BRIDGET 'S place in Connecticut . A summer living-room made out of a barn and attached to the main house . Time : Afternoon  --  three days later . The following Saturday . At Curtain : ROGERS MARY BRIDGET and WALTER are in the room . They all talk at once for a moment  --  discussing the room . ROGERS This is awfully good Mrs. Drake . I like it a lot . HOWARD I adore it , Bridgie . It sort of does that to you . Throwing out her arms and sitting on the chaiselongue at Right . MRS . DRAKE ( standing at Center ) Was n't Walter clever  --  joining this on to the house ? And those two rooms up there that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man  --  I mean two men for one bath  --  when it runs  --  are comfortable enough for anybody . ( ROGERS goes to the door at back . ) Do n't you think that door is cunning Mr. Woodruf ? I expect the original horses used to stand there and look out just like that . p. 46 ROGERS I expect they did . He leans out the half door and moves his head from side to side like a horse as they laugh at him . MRS . DRAKE I 'm sorry you did n't get here last night  --  I 'm going to call you Rogers  --  That 's when it 's heavenly . It 's so quiet  --  you simply ca n't sleep at all . ROGERS If I 'd got here last night I might have had to dash back this afternoon . As it is I can stay till tomorrow night  --  if you 'll let me . MRS . DRAKE Rather . MANNERS ( sitting in the large chair at Left ) Do you like the walls Mary ? HOWARD Awfully . MANNERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all . I 'm fed up with everything that everybody 's doing . HOWARD I know  --  but I do think one thing is too bad . MANNERS I know what you 're going to say . MRS . DRAKE What ? HOWARD Too bad not to have that marvelous old fireplace out here . p. 47 MRS . DRAKE Oh no it is n't ! MANNERS Bridgie has no reverence for originals . MRS . DRAKE I have not . I ca n't look an original in the face without  --  MANNERS Being a bit nauseous if you know what she means ? MRS . DRAKE Thank God there 's nothing to live up to in this room . I can do as I please in it without  --  desecrating the period ! MANNERS ( standing up ) Let 's clear out Bridgie . They want to get to work . MRS . DRAKE It certainly is an easy profession to just sit around with a pencil . I do n't see why I do n't do it . I think anybody could write here in this heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PIERRE the butler comes in from the Left . PIERRE is about fifty  --  French and temperamental rather than efficient . PIERRE Pardon madame . Puis-je vous causer un instant ? MRS . DRAKE Pas maintenant Pierre . Je suis fatigue  --  fatigue . Il faut restez un peu .  --  Let me alone . p. 48 PIERRE Mais madame le jardinier dit qu'il refuse de couper l'herbes sur la terrace  --  prs de la maison . MRS . DRAKE He does n't have to . Vous . Il faut vous . PIERRE Mais Madame  --  MRS . DRAKE ( going out Left ) I will not have this confusion . Il faut oranisez  --  organisez . PIERRE follows BRIDGET out repeating what the gardener has said to him . MANNERS My idea of a good organizer is Bridgie . He goes out . HOWARD ( still on the chaise-longue ) There 's the manuscript . Pointing to her work on the desk . ROGERS Oh never mind the book . HOWARD Give it to me please dear . ROGERS brings the manuscript to MARY and bringing the small chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't why I 'm here . Why have you kept me away from you for two days ? p. 49 HOWARD To be sure  --  of myself . ROGERS You were sure  --  the other night . HOWARD ( very honestly ) For a minute yes . If Jimmie had n't happened  --  I might  --  yes  --  I would have  --  let you stay . ROGERS You 're not going to let anything as accidental as Jimmie  --  HOWARD No  --  of course not . But then it would have been only emotion  --  now I know . ROGERS Well ? HOWARD I know it 's right for me to love you . I know that anything that means what this does to me  --  must be right . ROGERS Mary  --  HOWARD But Rogers  --  let 's not fool ourselves . Other people have thought they were sure of their love too  --  and look at them ! You 've made one mistake . I do n't want you to make another . I will not let you get a divorce till we know our love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And after a while  --  if we do know  --  I 'll marry you . This is the only way it 's right  --  for me. p. 50 ROGERS Mary you 're great . HOWARD I 'm doing this with my eyes wide open . Oh Rogers  --  you do n't know  --  what it means  --  for my kind of a woman to do this . ROGERS ( rising and standing above her ) Oh yes I do . HOWARD But you do n't . You ca n't . ROGERS ( putting a hand on her shoulder ) But I do  --  and it makes me love you  --  even more . HOWARD I know now my book is true . I know I could do what she does . I know she could go to the wife and tell her . ROGERS ( turning away to Center ) That 's where you lose me . I do n't believe that . HOWARD But she would . I may do it myself  --  sometime . ROGERS And that 's what I would n't let you do . I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let me . Oh dearest you 're awfully honest  --  and awfully sweet  --  and I love you and you 've got the best looking feet in the world  --  thoroughbred . HOWARD But listen dear  --  if Eileen says  --  " What would it do to your life to give him up " ?  --  and the wife says  --  " I have to know how much you mean to him before I can answer that  --  " p. 51 ROGERS ( going to the piano to get a cigarette ) But I do n't think wives talk like that . HOWARD But she might . ROGERS What might be is n't as important as what is . HOWARD But if these two women do n't come together and say these things to each other my story 's nothing but a hum-drum everyday affair . ROGERS Life is a hum-drum everyday affair . If you 'd just make us see what love does  --  to average people . HOWARD But they are n't just average . ROGERS It would be so much bigger job of writing  --  if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've got something in you that you  --  HOWARD That I think is right and I want to say it . Why write about this same old thing unless I say something new and honest  --  from a woman 's standpoint ? ROGERS But why try to say anything dear ? Just tell your story and let it alone . Why not make us see that these poor devils are caught by something they ca n't help  --  have nothing to do with ? p. 52 HOWARD But they can have something to do with it  --  not just let life do things to them . ROGERS How ? I can no more help loving you than I can help breathing . And for the same reason I ca n't help not  --  staying  --  just as I was . HOWARD That 's what I want these two women to acknowledge  --  about that man  --  and decide how they can keep it from destroying either of them . ROGERS ( putting his cigarette in the tray on the desk ) Do n't be a child Mary . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And why should she ? HOWARD Because she  --  ROGERS If that woman loves that man the way you make us believe she does  --  and that 's the best writing in the book Mary  --  she 'd take him . She would n't talk about it . ( He goes to her . A pause as he looks down at her . ) I 'm going to take awfully good care of you dearest . He kisses her hair . BRIDGET comes in from the Left and stops in amazement turns and goes out again and sings outside . HOWARD ( pushing ROGERS as she hears BRIDGET ) Go ' way . p. 53 MRS . DRAKE ( coming in again very innocently ) There 's a long distance for you Rogers . ROGERS Damn ! I was afraid of that . HOWARD Why ? Who is it ? WALTER comes in from the Left and goes to the piano  --  playing softly . ROGERS I expect it 's Timothy Bix . I left your phone number at the office Bridget . I never tell them where I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone number  --  in case anything really important comes up . He goes out Left . HOWARD Was it  --  the  --  office Bridgie ? MRS . DRAKE What ? I do n't know . I s'pose so . It sounded like an office .  --  I mean it did n't sound like his wife  --  if that 's what you mean . I did n't say who I was  --  I sounded perfectly impersonal  --  like a hotel or something . You need n't worry . PIERRE ( coming in from the door at back ) Pardon Madame  --  peut on parlez avec Madame un moment ? MRS . DRAKE No one may not . Go away  --  Pierre . I 'm resting . p. 54 PIERRE Mais Madame  --  He goes on protesting in a stream of injured French . ROGERS ( coming back from the Left ) It 's a beastly bore . MRS . DRAKE What 's the matter ? ROGERS I have to go back to town . HOWARD Oh  --  MRS . DRAKE Oh  --  why ? Do n't do it . ROGERS That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him . Damn decent of him . I want his stuff and I 've got to go in and cinch it . He 's sailing Monday . May I have my car  --  Bridgie ? MRS . DRAKE If you must . And we 're going to have such a good dinner ! ROGERS I 'm sorry . MRS . DRAKE Pierre  --  get Mr. Woodruf 's car out  --  toute suite . Dpchez vous . PIERRE Mais Madame  --  Going on again with his protest . MRS . DRAKE Toute suite . L'automobile de M. Woodruf . PIERRE disappears. p. 55 ROGERS ( to BRIDGET ) I think I could get back for that dinner  --  if I may . Or  --  early after dinner anyway . ( To MARY . ) And tomorrow  --  we 'll put in a good day  --  and finish off the job . HOWARD ( getting up ) I 'll ride down to the end of the little road with you . She goes out Left . ROGERS I 'm sorry Bridgie . You 're awfully good to let me hop in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY out . MANNERS ( still playing ) Hope you make the dinner . ROGERS ( calling back ) Thanks old man . MRS . DRAKE I hope he does n't get back . MANNERS Why ? MRS . DRAKE ( pointing upstairs ) I 'm going to put him up there . After all  --  it 's much better than over in the other part . MANNERS What difference does it make to you where he sleeps ? p. 56 MRS . DRAKE The other room is  --  well  --  it 's next to Mary 's  --  and it looks so . . . ( WALTER laughs . ) Do n't be filthy . MANNERS Why did you ask him if you 're going to get cold feet ? MRS . DRAKE I do n't know what you mean . I think it 's perfectly awful to think such a thing  --  let alone help . MANNERS They do n't need any help . MRS . DRAKE Well I 'm not helping . If you do n't know anything  --  that 's different  --  and I do n't . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hell have I said ? MRS . DRAKE No  --  but when you do n't  --  you 're worse than when you do . MANNERS ( playing again ) Well  --  it 's a very beautiful day . A pause . MRS . DRAKE ( sitting in the small chair at Center ) After all what is a nice woman to do ? MANNERS When ? p. 57 MRS . DRAKE If she falls in love with the wrong man . She ca n't help it . MANNERS ( getting up from the piano ) I 'm the right man . Why do n't you marry me ? MRS . DRAKE To be ten years older than a man is just about the only reason on earth for not marrying him . MANNERS I 'm a hundred and fifty older than you are . ( Getting the chair from before the desk and sitting near BRIDGET at her left . ) You 're the youngest thing I ever knew . MRS . DRAKE Just because I 'm honest enough to say ten  --  you probably think it 's twelve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's it all about anyway ? We 're only wasting time . MRS . DRAKE Do n't tempt me Walter . I 've just got strength of character enough not to marry you  --  or anything  --  but not enough to send you away forever  --  and I 'm just sorry for myself I 'm so lonely . MANNERS Dearest . Then do n't be . Sitting in the chair he had been leaning on. p. 58 MRS . DRAKE All women are  --  except a few lucky ones who happen to get the right man and how they ever do it I do n't see . MANNERS I 'm lonely without you too . MRS . DRAKE Oh no you 're not . Not in the same way . Men mean a great deal more to women than women do to men . MANNERS Oh come ! MRS . DRAKE They do . I do n't care what strong women  --  like Mary tell you about loving their work and their freedom  --  it 's all slush . Women have got to be loved . That 's why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're daring to have lovers  --  good women  --  because they just ca n't stand being alone . Because I have money and can buy anything on earth I want do you s'pose that means anything ?  --  People say " Why do n't you adopt a child ? " MANNERS Well why do n't you ? I 'll help you . MRS . DRAKE If I 'd had one when Frank was alive it would be awfully convenient now  --  but to go and pick one out ! And then when it began to do things you do n't like you 'd want to kill it . MANNERS I 'll help you do that too . p. 59 MRS . DRAKE Sally Brent said she would n't risk taking a baby  --  but she took a girl sixteen and was dotty about her . She said " This is it ! " And when the girl was eighteen she took Sally 's beau away from her . And anyway  --  My God  --  children do n't fill a woman 's life .  --  And charity !  --  I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I simply ca n't stand women 's meetings . I 've thought of everything  --  and as to an old man who would be faithful and everything  --  there 's nothing so creepy and crawly as an old man . ( WALTER shouts with laughter . BRIDGET puts a hand on his arm as he kisses her shoulder . ) How can I help loving you Walter ? You 're just right . Not too terribly intelligent  --  intellectual I mean  --  and your taste and your  --  music  --  and your sense of humor  --  LEE ( appearing at the door at back ) I beg pardon  --  Will you kindly tell me if this is the road to  --  ( BRIDGET turns . ) Bless my soul  --  it 's Bridgie . How did you get here ? MRS . DRAKE ( standing up ) How did I get here ? I live here . p. 60 LEE Are you joking ? MRS . DRAKE I wish I were . MANNERS ( putting his chair back before the desk ) How did you get here ? LEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRAKE Do n't tell me you 're lost . LEE No I 'm found . I thought I was taking a short cut from the Meadow Club to the New York road . MRS . DRAKE ( going to the Left entrance to ring the bell which is at the lower side of the door ) Come in . Come in and have a drink . LEE I 'd like nothing better but I 've got a  --  woman with me . MRS . DRAKE ( drawing her hand away from the bell to look at JIMMIE ) Sounds terrible . LEE A lady  --  a perfect lady . MRS . DRAKE ( pressing the bell ) Oh ! Well bring her in anyway . Who is she ? LEE A  --  she 's  --  kind of a cousin . MRS . DRAKE Oh  --  that 's too bad . p. 61 LEE No  --  she 's all right . He starts out . MRS . DRAKE Mary 's here . LEE ( turning back ) Oh  --  Is she ?  --  Is she ? MRS . DRAKE She is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's grand . Anybody else ? MRS . DRAKE No . Why ? LEE I thought if you had a crowd we would n't come in . JIMMIE hurries off . MANNERS Mary 'll be tickled pink to see Jimmie . MRS . DRAKE She 'll be tickled purple that Woodruf is n't here . Go watch for her and warn her Jimmie 's here  --  before she comes in . MANNERS ( going to the Left entrance ) Too bad to spoil a nice moment . MRS . DRAKE ( pressing the bell again ) Do n't you s'pose this darned thing rings at all ? MANNERS Probably not . MRS . DRAKE ( still at the bell ) It rang yesterday . p. 62 MANNERS ( as he goes out Left ) Then you ca n't expect it to ring today . MRS . DRAKE Nothing works . Nothing but me . I 'm simply going back to town to rest . She goes out after WALTER . After a moment JIMMIE comes back to the door . LEE ( looking in ) Bridgie  --  ( He opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone outside . ) Come in . They were here a minute ago . Come in . CLAIRE WOODRUF comes in . She 's about thirty-six . Fairly tall  --  with a strong slender body  --  a fine head and a very intelligent face which is sometimes plain and sometimes beautiful . Her sport clothes are severe and extremely good . CLAIRE ( as she sees the room ) How nice ! LEE I did n't tell her who you are . CLAIRE Ought I to know who Mrs. Bridget Drake is ? LEE She 'll think so . ( JIMMIE is getting very nervous . ) I told her you were a sort of a cousin . p. 63 CLAIRE Why in the  --  LEE Yes . CLAIRE ( smiling at him ) Oh  --  I see . She 's your Mrs. Bridget  --  and you do n't want to be caught lost with another woman . LEE Not exactly  --  but  --  CLAIRE ( coming down into the room ) You 're terribly excited all of a sudden . I think I 'll go back and wait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see me at all . Tell her your cousin is lame . She turns to go . LEE ( stopping her ) No  --  hold on . . . . I 'll tell you . It is n't Bridget . There 's another one here  --  the woman I am nuts about  --  always have been and always will be . CLAIRE Then for goodness sake tell her who I am  --  and she wo n't mind . LEE No  --  a  --  She 'd  --  a  --  I tell you  --  I 'm the dust under her feet  --  not the cream in her coffee . CLAIRE I ca n't believe that . p. 64 LEE But I 've got an idea . She never saw me with another woman  --  just thinks I never am with one  --  and if she sees me now with you  --  and you 'll play it up a little  --  it might  --  she might sit up and take a little notice . Are you game ? CLAIRE ( greatly amused ) Why not ? LEE But I  --  ca n't  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name  --  and she  --  a  --  would n't think  --  what I want her to think . CLAIRE My name would n't mean anything to her . LEE Yes it would . She writes . If I said this is Mrs. Rogers Woodruf  --  In fact  --  come to think of it  --  your husband is her publisher . Ever heard of her  --  Mary Howard ? CLAIRE Of course . LEE Like her stuff ? CLAIRE ( with real enthusiasm ) One was awfully good . LEE S'pose I use just half your name  --  Claire . Mrs. Claire  --  that 's slick . p. 65 CLAIRE ( more and more amused ) I could n't keep it up long  --  but it 's more fun than I 've had in a blue moon . The whole day has been . ( Sitting on the chaise-longue . ) You do n't know it but you 've helped me through an awfully hard place . LEE How come ? CLAIRE ( taking off her gloves ) I would have been stuck in town all alone  --  if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to fly off unexpectedly to one of his authors . LEE Great luck for me you could come . Darn nice of you too . You were taking a chance  --  on such short notice . CLAIRE No  --  I was n't but I ca n't help wondering why you did it . I 'm not brilliant but I 'm very intelligent  --  and I know myself . This sort of thing is not what I attract . A  --  She stops suddenly . LEE What 's the matter ? CLAIRE Did you plan to get lost here  --  just to have this girl see you with me ? p. 66 LEE What ? CLAIRE You did . LEE So help me  --  CLAIRE ( getting up and going to JIMMIE ) Of course you did . I wondered why you were so keen about today  --  and so stubborn about taking this road . LEE Do n't give me away  --  will you ? CLAIRE ( laughing ) It 's the funniest thing that ever happened to me . And why me ? Why did n't you get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because she 'd know I would n't fall for that . You 're just the kind she 'll  --  MRS . DRAKE ( coming back breathlessly ) You 'd think just unexpectedly opening a bottle of white rock was a day 's work . I 'm so sorry . Looking at CLAIRE . LEE ( very nervous ) This is Mrs. Claire . A  --  gosh  --  what 's your name Bridget ? MRS . DRAKE Drake  --  you idiot . ( Shaking hands with CLAIRE . ) How do you do  --  Mrs. Claire . I 'm so glad you got lost and came in. p. 67 CLAIRE So am I. MRS . DRAKE Have you been  --  Where have you been ? LEE Playing golf at the Meadow . I s'pose Walter 's here . MRS . DRAKE You suppose he is ? You know he is . You saw him . LEE That 's so . I did . I 'm so used to seeing him when I see you I ca n't tell when I see him and when I do n't . JIMMIE pulls at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter with you Jimmie ? Are you tight ? LEE Hell no . That 's why I 'm nervous . ( Going across to look out the window at Right . ) Well  --  the new layout 's swell  --  very pastoral . MRS . DRAKE Have you ever struggled with an old place  --  Mrs. Claire ? CLAIRE No  --  but I 've always thought I 'd  --  MRS . DRAKE ( not listening ) Who was at the club Jimmie ? I did n't know you belonged . CLAIRE  --  amused  --  goes to sit in the large chair at Left Center. p. 68 LEE I do n't !  --  I got somebody to put me up . HOWARD ( rushing in from the door at back ) It 's beginning to rain . I had to run . Stopping in amazement as she sees JIMMIE . LEE ( after a pause ) Yeah . Funny is n't it ? Did n't know I was anywhere near . This is  --  MRS . DRAKE ( helping him out ) Mrs. Claire . LEE Miss Howard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do . CLAIRE How do you do Miss Howard . HOWARD ( looking at JIMMIE suspiciously ) How on earth did you  --  LEE Golf . Meadow Club . I was  --  a  --  MRS . DRAKE Taking a short cut . LEE Yes  --  and I  --  a  --  MRS . DRAKE Got lost . LEE Yes . I got all balled up . See ? p. 69 HOWARD Yes  --  I see . LEE Do n't know how I did it . HOWARD All I know is you never do anything you do n't want to do . CLAIRE It 's the only thing I 've ever seen you try that you did n't do  --  perfectly  --  Jimmie dimmie . ( She smiles at him so warmly that even JIMMIE is a little taken off his feet . MARY gives CLAIRE a long interested look . ) Have you got my handkerchief  --  lamb ? LEE ( after a slight pause ) Have I ? He looks in all his pockets  --  overdoing it slightly . CLAIRE ( having a very good time at JIMMIE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That one over here . When we were sitting under the tree waiting for that funny woman to drive off . Remember ? CLAIRE laughs . LEE ( going to CLAIRE and laughing elaborately ) Oh  --  sure . HOWARD ( as they go on laughing ) She must have been funny . p. 70 LEE She was . CLAIRE Ca n't you find it  --  old thing ? LEE No . Take mine  --  snooks . He unfolds a fresh handkerchief of his own and gives it to CLAIRE . CLAIRE  --  taking the handkerchief  --  gives JIMMIE 'S hand a squeeze . BRIDGET raises her eyebrows as she and MARY look at each other . PIERRE coming in from the Left brings a large tray of bottles  --  ice etc. which he puts on a table down Left . MRS . DRAKE ( going to table to see what PIERRE has brought ) Jimmie says Mrs. Claire is some kind of a cousin . HOWARD ( looking steadily at JIMMIE ) Oh  --  indeed . I did n't know you had a cousin . LEE There are  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk about . BRIDGET 'S voice rises with PIERRE 'S as they argue about the drinks . BRIDGET points and gesticulates and explains desperately  --  half in French  --  half in English . PIERRE keeps his dignity but his anger rises with his emotion . LEE ( going to them ) Let me do it . What 's the trouble ? MARY sits on the chaise-longue. p. 71 MRS . DRAKE That will do Pierre . Go away . PIERRE Mais madame a dit de ne pas en apporter . MRS . DRAKE No  --  go away . PIERRE Mais madame m'a dit  --  MRS . DRAKE I did n't . I did n't say no crackers . I said nothing but crackers . Never mind now . Allez  --  allez . PIERRE goes out with injured dignity  --  muttering to himself . MRS . DRAKE You do it Jimmie . LEE ( opening bottles deftly ) Nobody wants a cracker . Say when darling . CLAIRE Meaning me ? HOWARD ( smiling at CLAIRE ) Who else ? MANNERS ( coming in from the Left ) Where do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get in Mary ? HOWARD Through the door . How do you s'pose ? MRS . DRAKE ( frowning at WALTER as she stands at Center below the desk ) Of course she came in through the door . What are you talking about ? p. 72 MANNERS I 'm not talking . MRS . DRAKE Well do n't . She sits in the chair at the desk . HOWARD Do you know Mrs. Claire  --  Walter ? Mr. Manners . She 's  --  a cousin  --  of Jimmie 's . CLAIRE AND WALTER ( at the same time ) How do you do ? LEE ( having made a highball ) This is for Mrs. Claire  --  Walt . Give it to her will you ? How about it Mary ? HOWARD Just a little one please . CLAIRE ( as WALTER gives her the glass ) This is awfully nice  --  but I feel like a dreadful interloper . HOWARD I do n't see why . MRS . DRAKE Neither do I. I expect anything to turn up this summer . They laugh at BRIDGET . WALTER takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaise-longue  --  with his own . PIERRE ( who has come in from the back ) Madame veut que je mettre l'auto dans la garage ? Il va pleurer trs fort toute suite . p. 73 MRS . DRAKE Do you Jimmie ? As JIMMIE brings her drink to her . LEE Is he talking about me ? MRS . DRAKE Your car . He says it 's going to rain hard . LEE No  --  just close the windows . It wo n't be the first time she 's been soaked . MRS . DRAKE Clozez . Clozez . PIERRE Very good madame . PIERRE goes out at the door at back . LEE It wo n't last long . Much nicer here than on the road . Do n't you think  --  cousin ? Going back to the table to mix his own drink . CLAIRE It 's delightful . How very charming this room is ! MRS . DRAKE Walter did it . LEE What did you do with the cows Walt ? Too bad to turn them out . MRS . DRAKE Now do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's as fragrant as new mown hay . MRS . DRAKE ( sniffing ) What does hay smell like ? That 's the last straw . They laugh at BRIDGET who is very pleased with her joke. p. 74 CLAIRE It 's a wonderful place to work . Are you working here now Miss Howard ? HOWARD A little yes . LEE ( standing near CLAIRE ) How 's it coming Mary ? HOWARD All right . CLAIRE I know your books  --  of course . HOWARD Yes ? CLAIRE I like " Alice " best . In fact I liked it so much I reread it the other day . HOWARD ( interested and going to sit on the small chair at Center  --  to be nearer CLAIRE ) Really ? How awfully nice ! LEE That 's the one I  --  HOWARD ( interrupting ) Why do you like it best ? Tell me . CLAIRE It 's so astonishingly true  --  from a girl 's standpoint . LEE What did I tell you Mary ? CLAIRE ( not listening to JIMMIE ) When she tells the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and understands why he does n't love her in the same way  --  It 's  --  Well I think that 's very fine . p. 75 LEE What did I  --  WALTER moves to the Right side of the chaise-longue and sits on it . HOWARD How awfully nice to hear a woman say that . If you think the girl was true you 'll like the new one  --  from a woman 's standpoint . LEE Tell her about it Mary and see what she  --  HOWARD Jimmie does n't like it . He says it is n't true . But any woman  --  I wish you 'd tell me what you think after you 've read it . CLAIRE I 'd love to . When is it coming out ? HOWARD August I hope . As a matter of fact I 've been working on the last chapter today . MRS . DRAKE ( getting up quickly and going closer to MARY ) Why have you Mary ? Well  --  well  --  I did n't know that . I mean I saw you sitting around with a  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . Anything creative I mean . This creative business is so funny . You never do know when it 's going on . I s'pose the people themselves do n't . Are you creative Mrs. Claire ? I know I would be if I 'd just let go . Would you like to see the rest of the house Mrs. Claire ? p. 76 CLAIRE ( rising and putting her glass on the table at Left ) I 'd love to . MRS . DRAKE ( as she goes towards the entrance at Left ) This was the kitchen  --  but Walter turned it all around and put the front in the back . Come on Walter and explain what you 've done . CLAIRE WALTER and JIMMIE go out at Left  --  BRIDGET waits in the room by the door as they go through . LEE ( as he goes ) I certainly am glad I got lost in the right place Bridgie . MRS . DRAKE ( turning back to MARY quickly and whispering ) Shall I ask them to stay to dinner ? HOWARD No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( JIMMIE comes back . ) As I say that 's where they used to hang the oxen and roast the crane . She goes out . HOWARD I like your cousin  --  Jimmie . LEE I thought you would . HOWARD ( still sitting at Center ) Why have n't I seen her before ? p. 77 LEE In  --  Europe a  --  most of the time . HOWARD Is she a widow ? LEE Practically . HOWARD Oh  --  one of those . What 's her name ? LEE Mrs. Claire . HOWARD Her first name . LEE ( after a slight pause ) Clara . HOWARD Where 's her husband ? LEE That 's just it . HOWARD Well never mind  --  she seems terribly keen about you . LEE Why should n't she be ? HOWARD No reason in the world why she should n't . She 's it  --  then  --  for you ? LEE You told me to get somebody else  --  day before yesterday . HOWARD You were pretty quick . I think it 's grand . I like her enormously . LEE Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her because she 's intelligent and vital . I think it would be perfectly marvelous if you married a woman like that Jimmie . You 'd never get tired of her . Going to JIMMIE. p. 78 LEE Think not ? HOWARD ( putting a hand on JIMMIE 'S shoulder ) Never . I do want you to be awfully happy Jimmie . LEE When a woman says that to a man it means she 's in love with another one . Are you Mary ? HOWARD ( turning away to the Right ) Do n't be silly . LEE Would you tell me  --  if you were ? HOWARD Why not ? LEE That 's what I say . I know you are  --  so why not ? HOWARD You  --  LEE It sticks out all over you . It 's in your voice  --  it 's in your eyes . God  --  it 's in the room where you are . HOWARD I do n't know what you mean . LEE ( moving a little towards her ) You 're lying . What was Woodruf doing there the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  --  HOWARD Do n't be a fool ! We were working . I never heard of anything quite so funny . p. 79 LEE It 's not funny . HOWARD ( turning to him ) Is that why you  --  Were you snooping and spying ? You mind your own business Jimmie . LEE There 's nothing to it Mary . Nothing for you but the same old thing . For God 's sake snap out of it . HOWARD I do n't let anybody talk to me like that . LEE ( going close to her ) Are you honestly in love with him Mary ? HOWARD ( suddenly breaking ) More than I ever thought I could be Jimmie . It 's right . He belongs to me  --  nobody else . There is n't anyone else like this for him  --  never has been . LEE Do you believe that ? HOWARD I know . It 's right . It 's my happiness . LEE Stop Mary . Wait . You 'd think any other woman was the biggest fool on earth to get her self into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have it . You were n't lost at all . You came up here to see if he was here . Well he was  --  and he 's coming back . Their voices rise together. p. 80 LEE You 're insane . Pull yourself together . MRS . DRAKE ( hurrying back ) Stop yelling . What 's the matter ? JIMMIE goes to the window at Right . HOWARD ( going up Center ) Jimmie 's taking care of me . He 's my nurse . He came up to see if Rogers Woodruf was here . MRS . DRAKE ( standing at Left Center ) How perfectly absurd ! Of course he 's not here . Nobody 's here . How did you get that idea into your head ? Rogers Woodruf of all people ! Why should he be here ? HOWARD He went in town to see your friend Timothy Bix . LEE You do n't say . HOWARD And he 'll be back just as soon as he can get here . LEE Indeed ! MRS . DRAKE Who ? Timothy Bix ? Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told him . MRS . DRAKE Told him what ? One minute you tell me nothing and the next minute you spill out everything . How do I know who 's here and who is n't ? p. 81 LEE ( turning from the window ) Nobody 's here . Nobody was here  --  Bridgie . Let it alone . Do n't say anything about it  --  before my cousin . HOWARD No . Do n't let the cousin think I 'm a hussy . MRS . DRAKE Well what am I going to do if it does n't stop raining ? Mary wo n't let me ask you to stay to dinner Jimmie . HOWARD Of course I will . Ask him .  --  Ask him .  --  Jimmie and his cousin ! CLAIRE ( coming back with WALTER ) Your house is charming Mrs. Drake . I think you 've done wonders with it . Jimmie we must go on . The rain is n't going to stop . MRS . DRAKE Oh  --  I  --  you  --  I 'm sorry you wo n't stay . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't go out in this . A sharp flash of lightning comes into the room . MRS . DRAKE ( with a slight scream  --  going quickly to CLAIRE ) Oh !  --  I expect you like lightning Mrs. Claire . You look as if you do  --  calm and poised . Oh !  --  ( As another flash comes . ) Come here Walter . ( WALTER and CLAIRE stand near BRIDGET as she goes on explaining how the lightning affects her . ) It is n't the lightning  --  it 's the electricity . p. 82 HOWARD ( in low tones to JIMMIE at the other side of the room ) Tell her you 're going to stay . LEE But you do n't want me here . HOWARD Of course I do n't . Tell her now  --  you 're going to stay . LEE I think we 'll have to stay Mrs. Claire . CLAIRE 'S back is turned towards JIMMIE and MARY . BRIDGET is talking . HOWARD She does n't hear you . LEE ( raising his voice a little ) I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOWARD Why so formal ? Why the Mrs ? LEE Clara ! ( CLAIRE does n't hear him . ) I say  --  Clara  --  Clara ! ( He shouts . BRIDGET WALTER and CLAIRE turn to look at him . ) I say I think we 'll have to stay Clara . CLAIRE ( laughing suddenly as she understands ) Oh  --  Oh  --  yes . Well I  --  I 'm afraid we 'll be an awful nuisance . p. 83 MRS . DRAKE No you wo n't . I love unexpected things . Walter go tell Pierre there 'll be two more for dinner . ( WALTER starts to the bell . ) No you have to go tell him  --  and no matter what he says  --  be firm . Let 's have some bridge to keep our minds off the storm . Jimmie come help me get the things . WALTER goes out Left . JIMMIE goes to BRIDGET . BRIDGET gets the cards  --  pencils etc . HOWARD ( close to CLAIRE ) I 'll take you up to my room before dinner to powder your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOWARD You 're not . None of the rest of us will change anyway . CLAIRE ( as JIMMIE comes to them ) I knew she would n't be jealous of me Jimmie . LEE And I s'pose you are n't jealous of her . I s'pose you 're just handing me back and forth to each other . Well  --  I wanted you to meet anyway . You 've got a lot in common . HOWARD At least that 's one thing you 're right about Jimmie . I give you good on her . MARY moves away from them and goes to the piano . She tries the accompaniment of " Ich Liebe Dich " which she can only play in a feeble way. p. 84 CLAIRE ( to JIMMIE while BRIDGET and MARY talk ) We must tell them who I am now . LEE No ! We 'll have to go through with it . I know Mary so well . If I told her now she 'd be mad as a hornet because we 'd put something over on her . If I tell her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is funny . Just as funny as it can be . I 'm having an awfully good time . Clara ! They laugh and go on talking . MRS . DRAKE ( to MARY at the piano ) What 'll I do if this keeps up and I have to ask them to stay all night ? HOWARD ( trying to play the song ) Well  --  ask them . Why not ? MRS . DRAKE If they do stay  --  where shall I put her  --  next to you  --  or up there next to Jimmie ? HOWARD Next to me . I like her . Come and play this Walter . As WALTER comes back into the room . MRS . DRAKE Play loud Walter and drown the thunder . p. 85 MANNERS Oh I ca n't play that old thing . CLAIRE and JIMMIE have moved towards the piano . CLAIRE Perhaps I can  --  if it is n't too difficult . HOWARD ( getting up ) Oh  --  can you ? ( Over her shoulder to JIMMIE . ) I like her a lot Jimmie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in English ) I love thee more than any living creature . I love thee dear  --  I love thee dear For now and for eternity . BRIDGET WALTER and CLAIRE come into the song . JIMMIE listens with a sardonic expression in his face as CLAIRE smiles at MARY as they sing the words  --  " I love thee dear . " MRS . DRAKE ( at the end of the song ) It 's a nice old song  --  is n't it Jimmie ? I love the words . LEE Yeah  --  the words are swell . CLAIRE plays the last bars  --  " And for eternity "  --  as THE CURTAIN FALLS p. 86 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO Scene II Scene : MARY 'S bedroom . This scene is set within the " set " for the barn room . It is only a small portion of a room  --  showing a door at Center back leading into the hall  --  one at Right for the bathroom and another at Left leading into another bedroom . A window at back  --  Left Center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing table at upper Left of door . A single chair at Left end of bed . A low wide armchair at Left Center and a large stool near it  --  a small table at its right arm . Another armchair at Richt Center . The bed is turned down for the night  --  with nightgown and dressing gown on it  --  and slippers on the floor . The covers and pillows are lacy and pink and luxurious . On the bed table is a light  --  a small pitcher and glass  --  a few books . The general effect of the room is that of feminine charm and comfort . Time : About midnight  --  the same night . At Curtain : BRIDGET opens the door from the hall  --  and comes in followed by CLAIRE and MARY . MRS . DRAKE ( as she opens the door ) And this is Mary 's . CLAIRE ( following her in ) Oh  --  how quaint and sweet ! p. 87 HOWARD I adore it . MRS . DRAKE ( opening the door on the Left ) And I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other room ) That 's nice . MRS . DRAKE ( calling to CLAIRE ) I thought you 'd like being right here with Mary  --  rather than over in the barn with Jimmie . CLAIRE ( from the other room ) This one is charming too . What awfully pretty chintz ! MRS . DRAKE ( in a quick whisper to MARY while they are alone ) I had his luggage put in the other room . HOWARD ( impatiently ) All right  --  all right . MRS . DRAKE Pierre sleeps over the garage and if Rogers comes back tonight he 'll hear him and tell him his room 's been changed . CLAIRE ( coming back ) It 's perfect . I shall sleep  --  um  --  how I 'll sleep ! MRS . DRAKE I 'll get you a nightie and tooth brush and things . I have to do it myself . I 've just fired Marie . She was using my twenty-dollar-a-bottle skin tonic . p. 88 CLAIRE I 'm making an awful lot of trouble . MRS . DRAKE Not a bit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those tooth brushes . I 've had them on hand for years and nobody ever needs one . BRIDGET goes out closing the hall door . HOWARD Sit down . CLAIRE ( listening to the storm ) It 's just ripping up the world . Is n't it ? HOWARD ( sitting in the chair at Right ) Will it keep you awake ? CLAIRE N-o . If the storm had n't kept me from being able to telephone to the children  --  this would be a lot of fun . It 's a real adventure . She sits at Left . HOWARD I love unexpected things . Do n't you ? CLAIRE Yes  --  and they never happen to me . HOWARD You 're so interesting  --  and so contradictory . CLAIRE Why ? HOWARD You 're so full of everything that 's worth while . You simply vibrate with it  --  but you do n't seem to know it . p. 89 CLAIRE My vibration 's been a little subdued lately . You and Jimmie have keyed it up some . HOWARD Jimmie certainly is good at keying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A  --  nothing . HOWARD Say it . CLAIRE You do n't think for a minute Jimmie cares anything about me  --  that way ? HOWARD I hope he does . Nothing could be finer  --  for Jimmie . CLAIRE Nothing could be finer for me . I mean  --  for any woman . Jimmie has the makings of a great husband . HOWARD What ? CLAIRE He has that rare thing in men  --  he does n't expect women to like him . And if he gets the one he wants  --  he would n't be looking ' round because it would n't occur to him that anybody else would want him . That makes a marvelous husband . HOWARD Yes  --  but who wants a husband nobody else wants ? CLAIRE I did n't say that . I said a man who does n't think anybody else wants him . There 's a great difference . p. 90 HOWARD Do you think most men think somebody else wants ' em ? CLAIRE Of course . And somebody usually does . But that is n't in Jimmie and it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So do I. I love Jimmie but I get awfully mad at him . I 'm so mad at him now I could kill him . CLAIRE What 's he done ? MRS . DRAKE ( coming back with a very delectable nightgown negligee and slippers on one arm  --  and several toilet things in the other hand ) Have you ever used this ? That 's the cold cream and this is the skin tonic . Do n't you think my skin 's been looking a lot better lately Mary ? And here 's the darned tooth brush and paste . CLAIRE Are n't you a darling ! Oh how marvelous ! I sha n't be able to sleep from admiring them . Taking the nightgown and negligee . HOWARD Bridgie 's things are so alluring they 're indecent . MRS . DRAKE Well  --  why not ? I believe in keeping up your standards at night . You dab this on with a little piece of cotton and you can just feel your muscles pull up . p. 91 CLAIRE ( taking the bottle ) I 'll use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small pair of mules ) These are the ones I put by the chair in case anybody should make a mistake and get in my room . Nobody ever has . ( MARY and CLAIRE laugh . ) They 're like the guest towels that remain immaculate forever  --  till you finally just put ' em in the wash anyway . I 'm going to bed . I 'm dead . Good night . If the storm gets terrific I 'm coming right in here and crawl in bed with you Mary whether you like it or not . I 'm not afraid of lightning but it does something to me . ( Going to kiss MARY . ) Good night Mary . Good night Clara . I 'm awfully glad you 're here . I hope it wo n't be the last time . I like you because most women who know anything treat me as if I did n't  --  and you do n't . Good night . Your bell 's by your bed  --  when you want your tray in the  --  Oh  --  they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream over the banisters  --  hoping somebody will hear you . Night  --  night . HOWARD Good night darling . Good night Bridgie . Come in if you get afraid . CLAIRE ( speaking at the same time with MARY ) Good night  --  and thank you so much . You 've been so awfully kind . They all three call " good night " again and BRIDGET goes out through the hall  --  closing the door. p. 92 HOWARD I adore Bridgie . She 's the most intelligent fool I ever knew . MRS . DRAKE ( opening the door again ) Look at these two things I found prowling ' round . JIMMIE and WALTER come in . HOWARD And what are you doing here Jimmie ? LEE I came to see the rest of the house . I always like to know the layout before I go to bed . In case of fire . CLAIRE This was the time for the slippers Bridgie . Take them back . LEE What are those ? CLAIRE ( to WALTER ) Are n't they sweet ? MANNERS Oh  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you Walt ? MANNERS Down at the end of the hall . CLAIRE ( pointing to her room ) And I 'm in there  --  if you want to know . LEE I do . ( He crosses to the door of CLAIRE 'S room and looks in . ) Very nifty . I must say you do your guests well Bridgie. p. 93 MRS . DRAKE You have to  --  if you expect to get any . LEE God how I hate week-ends ! MANNERS Bridgie is in good week-end standing . It spreads . One guest tells another . LEE What I want to know is  --  why am I over in the barn  --  all alone ? I 'm house-broken as well as Walt . MRS . DRAKE There are n't any more rooms  --  idiot . LEE So these are your quarters Mary . All set for the summer  --  un ? HOWARD I hope so . MRS . DRAKE You 're going to get asked a lot too  --  Jimmie . MANNERS Do n't count on that too much Jimmie . She says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt  --  he was so sure he was coming right back . And he never got asked again . MRS . DRAKE He did not . He left it in the wrong place . HOWARD ( as JIMMIE looks about the room ) Yes  --  that 's a chair and there 's the bed  --  and that 's the bathroom  --  and I 'm right here . I hope you 're entirely satisfied with the inspection Mr. Lee . p. 94 LEE Entirely . Glass of water and all .  --  Well  --  you look very cosy  --  you two . I s'pose you 'll talk all night . This is just about the time a woman really begins . Where are you . Bridgie ? MRS . DRAKE Across the hall . Come on if you want to see a real one . MANNERS Bridgie does n't go in for quaintness and purity like this . MRS . DRAKE I do not . Marie Antoinette and Madame Recamier are n't in it . I said to Walter  --  " No Early American influence in my bedroom . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . BRIDGET goes out  --  followed by WALTER . LEE ( going to the door ) I 'll have a look at yours Walt  --  and then I 'll go back to my lonely cell . And if the lightning strikes me  --  in the morning papers at least I 'll be found alone . That 'll be a lucky break . He goes out closing the door . CLAIRE ( after laughing at JIMMIE ) Well  --  I 'll say good night too . I 'm sure you 're tired . HOWARD Not a bit . Do n't go . Unless you 're sleepy . I wonder if Bridgie gave you anything to read . ( Going into CLAIRE 'S room . ) If she did I 'm afraid Walter chose it for the cover and the color scheme . p. 95 CLAIRE ( calling after her ) That 's a better reason than most bedside books have . HOWARD It 's a beautiful little prayer book . CLAIRE Really ? I have n't seen one in years . HOWARD ( coming back ) Why do n't you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like it . I ca n't sleep while this is going on . CLAIRE ( getting up ) It would be nice to get these things off . I 've been in them a long time . She goes into the other room . MARY sings a snatch of " I Love Thee Dear "  --  as she sits on the bed and slips off her shoes and puts her feet in the mules which are on the floor . HOWARD ( standing up  --  and taking off her dress and putting on her dressing gown ) What you say about Jimmie interests me . CLAIRE ( from the other room ) Yes ? It 's always amusing to know what another woman thinks of your man . Is n't it ? HOWARD I 've known Jimmie so long I s'pose I take all his good qualities for granted . p. 96 CLAIRE And overemphasize his faults . His one-man dog devotion to you is the nicest thing I know about . HOWARD It 's not so one-doggish as I thought it was  --  since I 've seen him wagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her room as she ties the dressing gown ) You know you do n't have to worry about me . ( Looking down at her mules . ) I can only get the tips of my toes in  --  but they 're making a great hit with me . HOWARD Let 's see . They laugh . CLAIRE I shall have to sit down . She minces to the armchair at Left and sits . HOWARD ( pushing the large stool to CLAIRE ) Put them on this . CLAIRE puts her feet up . CLAIRE Thank you . HOWARD ( opening the box on the table by CLAIRE 'S chair ) Cigarette ? CLAIRE I 'd love one . Oh  --  this feels so good ! I left the house at nine o'clock this morning . p. 97 HOWARD ( giving CLAIRE a light and lighting her own cigarette ) You know  --  I 'd like awfully to know what you think of my book . CLAIRE So would I. I want to read it . HOWARD Two men have told me two different things . But I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own kind of women . CLAIRE Yes  --  of course . So would I  --  if I were writing . Women ca n't fool women  --  about women . HOWARD ( as they smile sympathetically at each other ) You bet they ca n't . If you told me it rang true I 'd tell these two men to go to . For instance one of them had the colossal masculine early Victorian nerve to say  --  " If a woman 's good  --  she 's good . If she 's bad  --  she 's bad  --  and that 's all there is to it . " Sitting in the arm chair at Right . CLAIRE Men are so proper and conventional about their own " good " women  --  are n't they ? Much more so than the women themselves . HOWARD And they do n't see any differences . It 's just black and white to them . p. 98 CLAIRE Um  --  y-es-s  --  but do n't you think if a man knows in the first place a woman has had other men  --  if he loves her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And if it 's the real thing he wants to marry her . Why not ? HOWARD But in my book she 's perfectly straight and she does n't want to marry him . CLAIRE Oh . Why ? HOWARD He 's married already . CLAIRE Ca n't he get a divorce ? HOWARD She does n't want him to . CLAIRE The wife does n't ? HOWARD No  --  the one he 's in love with . That 's the point to the book . She wants to be sure she loves him enough to marry him  --  and sure the man has n't made another mistake  --  before she lets him give up the wife . So she lives with him first . Do n't you think that 's natural  --  believable ? CLAIRE ( after a slight pause ) What kind of a woman is she ? HOWARD Our kind . Right out of the top drawer . Why ? Do n't you think she 'd do it ? p. 99 CLAIRE If she 's terrifically in love she  --  Love mixes us up so  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . She does it calmly and sanely because she thinks it 's the only fair  --  clean way to do it . Fair to herself  --  fair to him  --  and to the other woman . A pause . How about it ? CLAIRE Everything you say sounds so sane . But living a thing is so different . It knocks so much out of us  --  and into us . HOWARD Do you think what she does is right ? CLAIRE What do you mean by right ? HOWARD Do you think it 's moral  --  or immoral ? CLAIRE If she honestly thinks it 's right  --  of course it 's moral  --  to her . But  --  HOWARD Go on . CLAIRE It 's your book . You know what you want to say . HOWARD But there 's something about it you do n't believe . What is it ? CLAIRE It seems so impertinent . HOWARD No it is n't . I asked you . It helps me a lot . Go on  --  please . p. 100 CLAIRE How old is she ? HOWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOWARD Y-es . CLAIRE Then the hard part for me to believe is  --  that she could believe the man . HOWARD Good heavens why ? A woman knows when a man 's in love . CLAIRE Perhaps  --  but I suppose any married woman thinks the other woman ought to know enough not to believe a married man  --  if he 's making love to her . HOWARD But this is n't that sort of thing . Ca n't a man fall in love as deeply and honestly as a woman ? CLAIRE Of course . And if he honestly does love this woman  --  now  --  and if the wife still loves him  --  I think it 's about the most tragic thing in the world for all three of them . What in the name of God can they do ? I 'm curious to see what you do with them . Go on . What happens ? HOWARD After she 's lived with him for a year  --  CLAIRE What does the wife do all this time ? p. 101 HOWARD She does n't know . CLAIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ? HOWARD She is n't his mistress . CLAIRE What is she ? HOWARD I said they were lovers . There 's all the difference in the world . CLAIRE To her I s'pose  --  but I 'm afraid that 's what the wife will call her . This is awfully interesting .  --  And then what happens ? HOWARD After a year Eileen goes to the wife and tells her the whole thing  --  and they simply talk it out together . They 've both loved him  --  both lived with him . One phase of his life belonged to one woman  --  another to the other . CLAIRE And does the wife give him up ? HOWARD Yes . Do n't you think women can be big enough and intelligent enough to face this  --  without letting it destroy either one of them ? CLAIRE ( very kindly ) Of course you 'll write it brilliantly . HOWARD ( rising and going to the bed to pick up her manuscript which she put there when she came in ) That wo n't be any good  --  if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awfully good situation  --  to take these two women and put them together  --  and you 'll do it in a clever modern way . HOWARD ( opening the manuscript ) I do n't want it to be just modern and clever . I want it to be the real thing  --  so that any woman  --  Do you think it 's just made up stuff ? Putting the script down and coming to CLAIRE . CLAIRE Of course not . It could n't be . You believe it too sincerely yourself . HOWARD Well what is it you do n't quite swallow and respect ? Spit it out  --  just exactly what you think . MARY sits on the stool beside CLAIRE 's feet  --  leaning towards CLAIRE eagerly . CLAIRE How can your woman  --  Eileen  --  think the man is worth it  --  worth what it costs her ? HOWARD What does it cost her ? CLAIRE W-ell  --  her place in the sun  --  with life  --  does n't it  --   --  with him  --  and above all  --  with herself . HOWARD I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very little compared to what she gets . I think if she 's coward enough to push this love away  --  she 'd think all the rest of her life that she 'd cheated herself of the greatest thing in life . p. 103 CLAIRE ( putting her head back against her chair ) Y-e-s  --  but I think it takes an awfully big man  --  an awfully big nature to appreciate what she 's done  --  and stick  --  if he has n't married her . I think he 's pretty apt to wish after a while  --  she had n't been quite so magnificent for his sake . HOWARD Now you sound like Jimmie . CLAIRE Do I ? I 'm afraid I 'm not a very good judge of this story because I happen to be married to a man who can no more help attracting women than he can help breathing . And of course each one thinks she is the love of his life and that he 's going to divorce me and marry her . But he does n't seem to  --  somehow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't her kind of a woman . CLAIRE We 're all her kind of a woman . There 's nothing we can do about it . It 's that terrible getting tired of the things we 're used to . Nobody can help it  --  really . I get tired of him too  --  but I 've made him my man and built my life around that . HOWARD How wise and clever you are ! CLAIRE I was n't always so wise . When the first one happened it nearly killed me . I thought the end of everything had come . But when the second one bobbed up it took the sting out of the first because I knew then one did n't mean any more than the other to him . I can always tell when an affair is waning . He turns back to the old comfortable institution of marriage as naturally as a baby turns to the warm bottle .  --  Oh sorry . As one of her slippers falls off. p. 104 HOWARD ( putting it back on CLAIRE 'S foot and giving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet  --  thoroughbred . CLAIRE Thanks . I 'm grateful . I have n't heard that about my feet for a long time . HOWARD Go on . You say you 've built your life around him . CLAIRE Yes  --  I have  --  and he still has more charm for me than anybody else in the world . HOWARD That 's great . And you know no other vital thing is going to come along for him . CLAIRE I used to believe that  --  but I 'm not so sure it has n't come . HOWARD Oh  --  CLAIRE There 's somebody now  --  and it may be the real thing . Why not ? Of course it could happen . HOWARD I ca n't believe it . CLAIRE I do n't know where he is most of the time now and I lie awake telling myself what a fool I am to care  --  but when I hear his key in the latch everything in the world is all right again . I go to sleep half way happy  --  trying to make myself think this one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide her sudden tears. p. 105 HOWARD ( after a long pause  --  touching CLAIRE tenderly ) It will  --  because you are you . ( She rises and moves away  --  then turns to look at CLAIRE . ) But what if he did  --  CLAIRE Love somebody else ? HOWARD And she came to you honestly and told you how much she loved him . What would you do ? CLAIRE I 'd loathe her with a deadly hate that would shrivel her up . I 'd call her a vile brazen slut I suppose  --  and tell her to get out . But I do n't believe she 'd come . HOWARD But in my book  --  she does . CLAIRE ( with a faint bitterness under her charming gaiety ) If she did  --  if she came to me and said all she has to say about the fairness and rightness  --  I 'd like to say a thing or two to her . HOWARD ( keenly interested ) What would you say ? CLAIRE I 'd say of course something new is interesting . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same old way  --  and eat the same old way and walk the same old way  --  and so will you  --  after awhile . I 'd say of course I can understand his loving you  --  but are you prepared to stand up to the job of loving him ? Most of the things you find so irresistible in him are terribly hard to live with . You must love him so abjectly that you 're glad to play second fiddle just to keep the music going for him . p. 106 HOWARD Yes but do n't you think love makes everything easy ? CLAIRE No ! I think it makes everything hard . But of course I would n't say it . Those two women could n't talk to each other . HOWARD Now you sound like Roge . Moving away . CLAIRE Like who ? Staring at MARY . HOWARD ( going up to bed and taking her manuscript again ) My publisher . He was out here today working with me and he 's coming back . It 's this chapter between the two women that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too hot ? CLAIRE ( rising and going quickly to the window ) Yes  --  it is . HOWARD Do you want some water ? CLAIRE ( at the window  --  her back to MARY ) No  --  thanks  --  I 'm all right . HOWARD Are you sure ? CLAIRE ( controlling her voice ) Quite .  --  What were you going to say about your publisher ? p. 107 HOWARD He says the girl is the best thing in the book . But he does n't think the wife is real . CLAIRE ( still at the window ) And does he think the man is well done  --  that he would stick to the other woman  --  after she 's  --  lived with him ? HOWARD He says it would make him love her more . CLAIRE I suppose you 've done this girl  --  so well  --  because you believe  --  she 's right . You 'd do it yourself . HOWARD ( going slowly back to her chair ) Yes . I think love like that comes before everything . She did n't go after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just there  --  and the sun itself changed . The meaning to everything was there  --  in him  --  for her  --  and for him  --  in her . What could they do ?  --  It came .  --  It was .  --  That 's all . CLAIRE has turned to watch MARY  --  and now moves towards her . CLAIRE You ca n't hold him with just yourself . I do n't care how beautiful and clever and wonderful you are . He has to have something in him that will make him stick to you . Nothing else can pull a man and woman through the ghastly job of living together . When they . . . There is a soft knock at the door to CLAIRE 'S room . The door is pushed cautiously open and ROGERS comes into the room. p. 108 ROGERS Mary  --  I got back . As he sees CLAIRE he stops . HOWARD Rogers ! What is it ? ROGERS What are you doing here Claire ? CLAIRE She does n't know who I am Roge . To MARY . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fun  --  to make you jealous of me.  --  Is n't it ridiculous ?  --  And now you 've turned up Roge . It 's just as funny as it can be  --  Is n't it ?  --  Miss Howard has just told me you were her publisher . ROGERS It 's Miss Howard 's book I 'm working on Claire . CLAIRE Yes  --  of course . Miss Howard asked me if I thought the two women could talk to each other .  --  But it seems to me it 's up to the man to do the talking .  --  Do n't you think so Rogers ? Do n't you think he ought to tell both women which one he wants to spend the rest of his life with ? ROGERS Certainly I do  --  when the right time comes . CLAIRE By all means  --  it must be the right time . Going to her bedroom door . I 'm afraid I 've got your room . I think they 've put you over in the barn with Jimmie.  --  Sorry .  --  Go out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be asleep . She goes in closing the door. p. 109 HOWARD She knows ! ROGERS ( going to MARY ) Be careful Mary . HOWARD You must tell her exactly how it is  --  now  --  quickly . ROGERS Of course  --  but not here  --  not now  --  in this house . HOWARD But  --  Oh God  --  how can you tell her  --  ever Rogers ? It 's awful  --  for her . ROGERS It is  --  for all of us . He goes out through the hall closing the door . MARY hesitates  --  goes quickly to CLAIRE 'S door  --  lifts her hand to knock . The hand drops and she moves back  --  staring at the door as THE CURTAIN FALLS @x Time : Several hours later  --  about six o'clock in the morning . Place : The barn-room again . At Curtain : PIERRE comes in from Left in his morning white coat . He is carrying MARY 'S luggage . MARY follows him  --  dressed for going to town . HOWARD ( speaking in low excited tones as they come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambre gauche . Ne frappez pas .  --  Entrez.  --  Dites lui  --  je voudrais lui parler ici.  --  C'est trs important .  --  Vous comprenez ? PIERRE ( putting the luggage down at the foot of the steps which lead to the upper bedrooms ) Oui Madame  --  parfaitment . He goes up the stairs . HOWARD ( going to the stairs and calling up to him in a loud whisper ) And then get his car out .  --  L'automobile de Monsieur Lee . Ici  --  a cette porte  --  la . Vous comprenez ? PIERRE ( whispering back to her ) Oui Madame  --  certainment  --  toute suite . p. 111 HOWARD ( still looking up the stairs ) Be careful  --  do n't knock  --  go right in  --  Entrez . MARY moves about restlessly  --  lights a cigarette and puts it out . After a moment PIERRE comes down the stairs . PIERRE Monsieur va descendre l'instante Madame .  --  Monsieur comprends . Je sorterai l'auto de monsieur maintenant . PIERRE goes to the door at back  --  unlocks it and goes out . After another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing gown  --  his hair a little disheveled . LEE ( as he sees MARY ) What in blazes  --  HOWARD I 'll never forgive you as long as I live . Get your clothes on . You 've got to take me home . I want to get out of this house  --  quick . LEE What I wanted to tell you myself  --  afterwards . HOWARD Did she suggest this scheme  --  or did you ? p. 112 LEE God  --  no  --  I did . She did n't know what I was getting her into . HOWARD ( not believing him ) Oh !  --  Please hurry Jimmie . I want to get away  --  before anybody 's up . LEE But honest Mary  --  she did n't know what it was about . She was just a good sport . She thought it was funny to be Cousin Clara . HOWARD I hate you . LEE I s'pose you do  --  but she had nothing to do with it . I did the whole business . I was also Timothy Bix who telephoned and got him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEE I gave him time to get away  --  and then I brought her in  --  lost . HOWARD Of all the cheap  --  little boy tricks I ever heard of ! LEE What happened ? HOWARD Why was n't she honest  --  if she 's so fine ? Why did n't she tell me who she was the minute we were alone ? LEE How did you find out ? HOWARD I have nothing to regret  --  nothing to be ashamed of . She walks away. p. 113 LEE Well  --  I do n't know what you 're talking about Mary . HOWARD ( as she turns  --  facing him back of the chair at Left ) Oh  --  do n't you ?  --  Rogers Woodruf came back  --  that 's what I 'm talking about . Nobody told him his room was changed  --  evidently  --  so he went back to it  --  naturally . He saw the light under my door and knocked .  --  Why not ?  --  No reason in the world why he should n't . LEE Oh  --  I say  --  HOWARD ( moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have mattered in the least  --  if I 'd known who she was . But this way you 've made her think all kinds of  --  That 's what you 've done by your insane interference . How dare you do such a thing to me Jimmie ?  --  How dare you ! And why  --  why ? What did you think you were doing ? She goes close to JIMMIE . LEE ( taking her by her shoulders ) Trying to keep you from making a damned fool of yourself . HOWARD I hate you ! LEE That 's not important if you 've come to your senses . p. 114 HOWARD Do you think you 've changed anything for me ?  --  You could n't . Everything is just exactly as it was . LEE What are you raising hell about then ? HOWARD It 's simply brought things  --  to a crisis  --  that 's all . She 'll have to know now . LEE To know you 're in love with her husband . HOWARD That he is in love with me . But you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right way . She sits on the lower end of the chaise-longue . LEE What is the right way for a woman to know her husband 's in love with another woman ? HOWARD You 've put me in an unfair  --  undignified  --  Are you going to take me in or not ? LEE Yes  --  I am  --  but what are you running away from ? HOWARD I 'm not running from anything . But you 've made it impossible for me to stay . I ca n't see either one of them . I ca n't see him again  --  till he 's told her . It 's between them now . Go on  --  hurry  --  please ! CLAIRE ( coming in from Left ) Oh  --  I 'm sorry . I was going up to your room Jimmie  --  to ask you if you 'd take me back to town now . p. 115 LEE Oh  --  were you  --  did you ?  --  Good morning .  --  How are you this morning ? CLAIRE I know the children are frightened and wondering where on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit  --  if that 's what you want . HOWARD ( rising ) I 'm sorry  --  but Jimmie is going to take me in . That 's why I 'm down here . LEE Well  --  which is it ?  --  Will you match for it ? JIMMIE tries to smile  --  but gives up . CLAIRE You brought me Jimmie . I 'm afraid you 'll have to take me back . HOWARD I 'm going now . LEE I 'll take you both in  --  with the greatest pleasure . ( He starts for the steps  --  and turns . ) And  --  I 've just been telling Mary that you had nothing to do with my little joke  --  that I put it over on you too . In fact  --  come to think of it  --  you 're the one who ought to be sore at me  --  not you Mary . She wanted to tell you and I would n't let her . If I ever told the truth in my life  --  that 's it . I 'll jump into some clothes while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs p. 116 CLAIRE ( after a pause  --  looking at MARY ) The thing I 've always thought would happen has come  --  and it 's you . HOWARD You knew last night then . CLAIRE Not at first  --  and when I did  --  I did n't seem to be able to tell you who I was  --  which seems very stupid this morning . I 've had six hours to think . HOWARD So have I. Everything I said last night  --  is true . It 's me  --  and  --  that 's the way it is . CLAIRE And you think the wife ought to have the intelligence to give him up . HOWARD Is that what you 're going to do ? CLAIRE Is that what you expect me to do ? HOWARD It is n't  --  just as I thought it was going to be . I thought you were quite different somehow . I do n't know why I did  --  but I did . CLAIRE That has n't anything to do with this . HOWARD But it has . If you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 117 CLAIRE That has nothing to do with this . HOWARD But it has everything . That is what will make all the difference in the world  --  to me  --  now that I 've seen you . CLAIRE The only thing of importance to you  --  is how he loves you . HOWARD And that 's what he must tell you himself . None of us were ready last night to say what we must say . I 'm sorry Jimmie did this ridiculous thing . CLAIRE I 'm not . If he had n't I never would have known the kind of a woman you are . I never would have seen it from your . . . ROGERS ( coming down the stairs into the room and stopping as he sees the two women ) Why are you two down here at this ungodly hour ? A car wakened me . What 's all the commotion about ?  --  You look as though you were going into town Claire .  --  Why so early ?  --  I 'll take you in . CLAIRE We 're saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . So do n't be afraid to tell the truth now Rogers . She and I have n't lied to each other . I know  --  about you  --  and her . ROGERS Now wait Claire . You 're not going to misunderstand anything because I  --  opened that door last night ?  --  Why would n't I ?  --  I saw the light and thought Mary was still working of course . p. 118 HOWARD ( with sudden force ) Do n't try to protect me . I want to know what is right for me to do  --  for you  --  for all of us . ROGERS You surely have n't misunderstood anything Claire  --  about my friendship for Mary . We 're the greatest friends in the world  --  and we 've worked together a lot . As I told you  --  I came out here to get this book fin  --  HOWARD Do n't ! Tell her the truth Rogers . Nothing else will do . Anything else makes it all seem wrong . ( A pause . ) Are n't you going to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been lying to me ? ROGERS Mary  --  do n't . How can you ? HOWARD Have you ? ( ROGERS turns away . MARY looks at CLAIRE  --  CLAIRE lowers her eyes . MARY goes to ROGERS . ) Rogers  --  look at me . Have I only been a fool ? ( A long pause as MARY looks from one to the other  --  the full truth coming to her . She hesitates  --  then goes to the Left entrance and stops  --  her back to CLAIRE . ) If I had n't been a fool  --  it would n't have happened . I decided what I was going to do . He did n't ! I made myself think it was right . He did n't . It did seem right . It was right  --  to me  --  till I saw you . I 'm one of the others  --  absolutely . Nothing more . You know that . You see that  --  do n't you ?  --  I did n't know what I was doing  --  to you . I did n't know anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAIRE ( slowly and quietly ) It never mattered before who it was . ROGERS ( going to CLAIRE ) Claire  --  you 're the most intelligent woman in the world . You 've always looked facts in the face . What is there different about this ? CLAIRE I 've seen her . I know what she is . ROGERS And you know I would n't give you up for any woman on earth . That 's the point Claire . CLAIRE That always has been the point  --  but this time it is n't . ROGERS But it is ! You 're just the same to me  --  as you were  --  and I 'm just the same to you . CLAIRE I 've always been glad to get you back before  --  and thankful it was over  --  always thinking of you  --  never of her  --  but now  --  I 've seen her  --  and something has happened to me . I 've seen all of her  --  her whole heart and soul and self . And I know  --  so well how you made her love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAIRE She is n't " one of the others "  --  is she ? p. 120 ROGERS ( after a pause ) No  --  she is n't . She  --  No  --  she is n't . CLAIRE You want to marry her  --  do n't you ? ROGERS She 's the one and only woman I would want to marry  --  if it were n't for you . CLAIRE Take her . ROGERS Do n't be foolish dear . You 're there  --  always have been and always will be . I had no idea this thing would get me like  --  that it would  --  I 've made a damn fool of myself  --  that 's all . But I 've come to my senses . We 've been a success . You 've made it a success . You 've taken the best of me  --  and let the rest go . CLAIRE This is the last time for me  --  Rogers . ROGERS I 'll take you home  --  where we can talk this out  --  and I 'll make you understand exactly how it is . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEE ( comes quickly down the stairs ) Oh  --  hello Woodruf . Hello  --  hello ! You got back I see . Good morning  --  good morning . Are we all going in ?  --  Where 's Mary ? p. 121 CLAIRE She went out that way . Do n't bother about me Jimmie . I 'll go in with Rogers . That 's the easiest way . It does n't matter how I go  --  just so I get there . LEE Sorry to lose you . I 'd be awfully glad to take you both in . He goes out Left . ROGERS How in the name of all that 's holy did you get mixed up with him  --  and come out here ?  --  He 's in love with her of course . He put this idea into your head . Good God Claire  --  did you do this to find out if  --  CLAIRE ( suddenly tired and broken ) Oh  --  do n't Rogers . Get your things . PIERRE ( coming in from the back door at back ) L'automobile de Monsier Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Just throw my stuff in my bag  --  up there  --  will you ? PIERRE Oui monsieur  --  toute suite . PIERRE goes up the stairs . ROGERS Come on dear . CLAIRE You do n't even know what I 'm talking about . You ca n't conceive that I could stop loving you . But that 's what 's happened Rogers . It 's over . p. 122 ROGERS Claire  --  CLAIRE As completely as if it had never been . It happened in just one second  --  I think  --  when I saw what you 'd done to her . ROGERS You 've got it all wrong Claire . Ca n't you tell the difference between everything else on earth  --  and what you are to me ? What does all our life together amount to  --  if it ca n't  --  There 's nothing between us  --  if that 's what you 're afraid of . CLAIRE It is n't . That is n't important one way or the other now . ROGERS Then what are you  --  CLAIRE I 'm afraid of how I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're angry  --  and I do n't blame you a bit . I 'm sorry if I 've hurt you dear  --  terribly sorry . You were a brick last night  --  simply a brick . MRS . DRAKE ( rushing in from the Left  --  wearing a charming and diaphanous negligee ) What on earth is the matter ? I thought the house was on fire . What are you doing ?  --  You 're not leaving ? ROGERS The children you know . p. 123 MRS . DRAKE Whose children ? Are you going in town with him  --  Clara ? Where 's Jimmie ? Why do you go back with Rogers Woodruf ? CLAIRE Just to get to town . ROGERS I 'll bring the car here  --  to this door . ROGERS goes . JIMMIE comes in from the Left . MRS . DRAKE What about Mary ?  --  Why does n't she go with him  --  if anybody 's going ? CLAIRE ( going quickly to the door at back ) I 'm going now . I 'm going to take your car Jimmie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going home  --  now  --  or ever . She goes . LEE God ! Is that it ? MRS . DRAKE Of course if I had some slight idea of what is going on in my own house I might be slightly more intelligent about it . She sits on the chaise-longue . LEE A lot of water has run under the bridge since I came Bridgie . MRS . DRAKE Yes  --  I dare say  --  and all kinds of water  --  at that . p. 124 MANNERS ( coming in from the Left  --  wearing pajamas and dressing gown ) Speaking of the quiet countryside ! Broadway is a rest cure compared to it . What do you think you 're doing ? MRS . DRAKE I 'm playing on the piano . MANNERS So I see . What 's the tune ? If some people do n't want to sleep  --  why make it impossible for everybody else ?  --  What 's going on ? PIERRE comes down the stairs with a suitcase and goes out the door at back . MRS . DRAKE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or in or out  --  ( As she turns and sees PIERRE. )  --  or up or down . LEE Go easy on Mary just now Bridgie . She 's had a knock-out blow . WALTER goes to the window at Right . MRS . DRAKE What do you mean ? Did that woman take Woodruf away from her ? LEE That woman happens to be Mrs. Rogers Woodruf . MRS . DRAKE Of course you 're insane  --  simply insane . MANNERS What 's the big idea ? p. 125 LEE A cute little idea of mine . I thought if I got the two of them together  --  Mary would like her so much  --  if she did n't know who she was  --  that she 'd give him up . MRS . DRAKE What ?  --  And is that what 's happened ? LEE ( sitting on the stool at center ) Not on your life . It did n't work that way . She 's more keen about him now than ever . MRS . DRAKE Thank heaven for that . I 'm glad she knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There goes another one . That 's Woodruf  --  going off all alone . I had a hunch there was something phony about the cousin business . MRS . DRAKE Oh did you ? So did I. Now that Jimmy 's told me  --  I know I knew it all the time . MANNERS ( to JIMMIE ) I must say you had your nerve . MRS . DRAKE Nerve ? It was a dangerous thing to do . It might have worked . What if she had given him up  --  and let the wife have him ? I never heard of anything so silly and unnecessary . p. 126 LEE Well  --  she did n't give him up . Do n't worry . MANNERS I did n't know it was  --  like that  --  with Mary . I thought it was just  --  you know . LEE Get this . Mary 's in love with him . It 's big and clean with her . Now that it 's come to a showdown  --  God  --  if he does n't come through  --  I 'll kill him . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEE Noble my foot ! I love her . MRS . DRAKE That 's what I say . Why want another man to get her ? LEE Well  --  that 's the way I love her . MRS . DRAKE I must say I do n't get that . MANNERS I do . MRS . DRAKE Indeed ! HOWARD ( coming in from the Left ) She got in your car and went off by herself Jimmie . Did n't you tell her you 'd take her in if she wanted to go ? LEE ( rising ) I did . HOWARD Have you told Bridgie ? p. 127 MRS . DRAKE Oh yes  --  he has . She took Jimmie 's car and said  --  " I 'm not going home now or ever . "  --  And she meant it . She meant it . Everything 's going to be all right for you . HOWARD Do n't  --  please . MRS . DRAKE Oh shush Mary  --  do n't pose and be restrained about it . You wanted him  --  well  --  you 've got him . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did want him  --  but he did n't want me  --  in the same way  --  and it 's over . MRS . DRAKE Now  --  darling  --  do n't lose your nerve . Go on . HOWARD ( sitting at the Left in the large chair ) Bridgie  --  do n't please .  --  It 's over .  --  That 's all . MRS . DRAKE You  --  He  --  You do n't mean he took his wife  --  instead of you ? HOWARD That 's what I mean . MRS . DRAKE What a rotter ! ( WALTER shakes his head at her . ) Never mind Mary  --  it happens to all of us. p. 128 MANNERS Do n't talk about it now Bridgie . MRS . DRAKE Well  --  my God what shall we talk about ? It 's only six o'clock . HOWARD Go back to bed  --  all of you  --  please . LEE If I could have one of your cars Bridgie  --  to take Mary in town  --  I 'll get it right back to you . MRS . DRAKE Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What good will that do Mary ? It wo n't be any easier to stand in town  --  not as easy . It 's hot and smelly and horrid  --  and out here at least you 've got good air . There 's nothing so bad that a little physical comfort does n't make it better .  --  When Frank was having affairs with other women I was always so thankful I had a good bed of my own  --  and could have my breakfast in it . LEE ( tenderly  --  close to MARY ) Do you want to go Mary ? HOWARD Yes .  --  I do n't know what I want . MRS . DRAKE ( sneezing ) You wo n't be able to sneeze in town you bet Mary . Jimmie will stay too  --  wo n't you Jimmie ? You ca n't go Mary . You 've got to chaperone Walter and me . I ca n't dig up anybody else now . p. 129 MANNERS I can clear out  --  as far as that 's concerned  --  if you want me to . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ? MANNERS No  --  I ca n't . I do n't see why we 're trying to be so damned cheerful . MRS . DRAKE ( sneezing again  --  and getting up to go ) I 'm not a bit cheerful . MANNERS ( rising ) Get some clothes on before you get the pip . HOWARD No  --  do n't go Bridgie . Get in that and cover up . ( Pointing to the chaise-longue . ) I like to have you around . Let 's watch the sun come up together in the same old way  --  over the same old hills  --  old girl . MRS . DRAKE ( getting into the chaise-longue ) That 's the nicest thing you ever said to me Mary . Give me that blanket . I 'm just shot to pieces . ( WALTER and JIMMIE take the folded blanket and put it over BRIDGET . ) It 's grand to have two men tuck you in at the same time . Makes you feel so safe and good . ( After she is settled . ) I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for the rest of my life  --  and be bored stiff  --  but it 's an awfully wholesome feeling  --  especially at this time in the morning . ( PIERRE comes in from the Left with a tray and four cups of coffee . ) What ? Without even being told ? There 's a lot left to be thankful for . Thank you Pierre . That 's very thoughtful of you I 'm sure . BRIDGET and WALTER each take a cup of coffee. p. 130 MANNERS The French nation also believes that a cup of coffee helps most anything . JIMMIE takes a cup and gives it to MARY . PIERRE takes the tray to the table at lower Left . LEE But I do n't see how they believe it of their own coffee . Sugar Mary ? HOWARD No  --  black . LEE ( going to get his cup from the tray ) Merci Pierre . Comment  --  vous portez vous aujourd'hui ? PIERRE Pardon Monsieur ? PIERRE in a flood of French and hospitality offers JIMMIE everything possible for breakfast . LEE ( breaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oui Monsieur . PIERRE goes out Left . MRS . DRAKE ( after a long drink of coffee ) Of course it 's happened to me so often I never expect it to turn out right  --  but when a strong intelligent woman at last persuades herself that a man is the thing in life she wants  --  of course she 's the biggest fool of all . p. 131 MANNERS ( sitting in the chair Right of BRIDGET ) That 's a help . MRS . DRAKE You know what I mean Mary darling . HOWARD Perfectly . MRS . DRAKE I mean  --  HOWARD You need n't say it twice . Give me a cigarette Jimmie . MRS . DRAKE Why not be frank  --  after all why not ? You might as well spit the truth out about yourself  --  before other people do . Of course I think you 've been a fool Mary  --  but I love you all the more for it . It makes me feel so much closer to you . HOWARD Keep right on Bridgie . MRS . DRAKE I intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing Jimmie . If Mary had n't seen the wife and known how darn nice she is  --  she would n't have had her on her conscience . And if Rogers had n't had to stand up and face the two of you  --  I bet he would have taken you  --  if he could have done it  --  well  --  quietly  --  you know . Lord knows I hold no brief for men  --  but after all  --  you ca n't expect too much of them . With both women in the same room  --  especially unexpectedly  --  you do n't think he would say  --  right off the bat  --  " I 'll take you  --  not my wife "  --  now do you ? ( WALTER who is sitting at Right of BRIDGET  --  touches her elbow with his foot  --  making her spill her coffee a little . ) Walter 's being subtle . He thinks it would be a good idea if I got out and left you alone with Jimmie . I do n't . I think the raw naked nasty truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't be ass enough to try to patch things up for Mary Jimmie  --  now that you 've done the worst thing you possibly could do to her . The only real unhappiness on earth for a woman  --  is losing a man . I did n't begin to suffer when Frank died  --  as I did when he was having an affair . It 's a different thing entirely . Death is  --  well  --  it 's just death  --  and that 's the end of it . If you lose a man that way at least you know it 's not your fault . Death is n't nature 's greatest mistake  --  falling in love is . If we did n't have to do that  --  the real misery would be cut right out of life  --  but my God there would n't be any fun either  --  so what are you going to do about it ? p. 132 LEE ( sitting on the floor  --  his back leaning against MARY 's knees ) You 're right Bridgie . If I 'd minded my own damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOWARD You had n't anything to do with it really Jimmie . LEE What ? HOWARD I should have known sometime just what she was like . MANNERS You mean you would have known her  --  sometime  --  through him . HOWARD Yes . MRS . DRAKE You seem to be amazingly intelligent this morning Walter . You 'll get over it Mary . By Christmas he 'll just be on your list of casualties . MANNERS And the wife will probably take him back  --  by that time . HOWARD No  --  never ! MRS . DRAKE What makes you so sure ? HOWARD She does n't want him now . That 's what I 've done to her . I 'll never forget her eyes  --  what she saw . They are all quiet  --  staring thoughtfully  --  as THE CURTAIN FALLS ( END OF PLAY. )
