From South Africa 's Transvaal Museum , Dr. Robert Broom brought the skull of the new species of Australopithecus Transvaalensis Broom which he obtained last year after a blast in a South African limestone quarry . From Minnesota , Dr. Ernest Albert Jenks brought the mashed skeleton of " Brown 's Valley Man , " which he found in a gravel pit three years ago , believes is 12,000 years old . From Java , home of famed Pithecanthropus erectus , Dr. Ralph von Koenigswald brought replicas of eleven skulls lately found , relics of a hitherto un known tribe which inhabited the island 25,000 years ago . From China , Rev. Dr. Teilhard de Chardin brought replicas of the latest skulls , unearthed last year , of Sinanthropus pekinensis ( " Pekin Man " ) which by last week was being generally acknowledged as the champion oldster of all human fossils . A reasonable estimate of Pekin Man 's age is a million years . <P> These sardonic reminders of man 's brut ish origin were on view last week in Philadelphia 's Academy of Natural Sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , made by mysterious early Americans and dug up by scholars in New Mexico and Colorado , and reconstruction of dismembered and fragmentary fossils as they lay when dis covered in the earth - showing the ticklish task that confronts paleontologists when they exhume old bones , and the even more exacting problem of putting the pieces together in a meaningful pattern . <P> The occasion was the Academy 's " International Symposium on Early Man . " More than 300 anthropologists from Scot land , England , Denmark , Norway , Poland , Austria , Canada and the U. S. flocked into Philadelphia to spend four days discussing the human family tree . Dr. V. Gordon Childe of Edinburgh described a 5,000-year-old dog sled , whose runners were found in a bed of Finnish peat moss and which he called the oldest dated " nonhuman tractive power . " Father de Chardin charmed reporters by serenely remarking that he did not feel his belief in the ages-long evolution of man from inhuman brutes to be irreconcilable with religion . Said the priest : " There were two great crises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence of thought . <P> As a scientist I must admit the evidence that man was born from the animal king dom . But he was not an animal . The great , the tremendous , the significant fact about man is the coming of thought with and through him . "
