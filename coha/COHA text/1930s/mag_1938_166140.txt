Fountains wreathed with water babies , alabastrine goddesses and war groups in battling bronze were the common stuff of U. S. sculpture before Primitivism came in and chiseled its ears off . Lately critics have observed that from that chastening sculptors as a class have emerged with a burst of modest but lively ingenuity . Last spring a new Sculptors ' Guild took over a vacant lot in Manhattan . made news with a big outdoor exhibition ( TIME , April 25 ) . Last week the Brooklyn Museum 's luminous galleries held a more impressive show by the same Guild , whose membership includes the illustrious names of Manship , Zorach and Sterne , besides some 50 other Eastern artists . <P> Notable was the comparatively small size of the pieces on exhibit ( 85 out of 109 under 30 inches high ) . If the Guild 's outdoor exhibition was meant to show Sculpture for the Garden , this was apparently meant to show Sculpture for the Home . Sculptor William Zorach 's Youth won a great deal of admiration for its clean-cut and subtle modeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren Wheelock 's exuberant figure of Walt Whitman , Salut an Monde ( see cut ) , showed a new ease with planes and masses . Both made art critics wish for their enlargement to a less inti mate scale , and Wheelock 's conception of Old Brooklynite Whitman stirred up local talk of monumentalizing the poet . In Manhattan , meanwhile . Justin Sturm , famed ex-Yale end ( ' 21 ) . ex-novelist . Westport , Conn. ' s most popular sculptor , had an exhibition at the Karl Freund Galleries in which a wonderful lack of subconscious or other depth ( see col. 2 ) appeared in several homey , well-finished studies .
