In Angels Camp , Calaveras County , Calif. , last week there was a lot of hopping being done . Local businessmen were holding the ninth Annual International Jumping Frog Jubilee . For Calaveras County miners the jubilee , inspired by Mark Twain 's fabulous story , " The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , " is the sports event of the year . On Angels Camp 's main street thronged 35,000 spectators , including overdressed cinema celebrities to watch the two-day classic . The rules : 1 ) three jumps to a frog , the total distance to count as official ; 2 ) each frog might be shaken thoroughly to discover if he had been fed buckshot to hold him down . <P> Well-established favorite of the 300 pop-eyed entrants was Budweiser IV , descendant of Budweiser I , a 1932 champion now regarded as the Man o ' War among leapfrogs because of the long line of winners he has sired . In fine fettle and raring to go , Budweiser IV was counted on to smash the 13 ft. 5 in. mark set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the late Will Rogers ' Claremore , Okla. ranch . When the leaping subsided , it was announced that not Budweiser IV but the 1936 winner , Zip , had broken the world 's record , hopping the mighty hop of 15 ft. 10 in . He was promptly acclaimed the jumpingest frog in Calaveras or any other county .
