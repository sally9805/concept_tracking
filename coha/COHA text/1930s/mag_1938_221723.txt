Whiteoaks ( adapted by Mazo de la Roche from her novel Whiteoaks of Jalna ; produced by Victor Payne-Jennings ) . Chief distinction of Whiteoaks is its 101-year-old heroine , played to the age limit by Ethel Barrymore . A wealthy , imperious , chops-licking war horse , Gran Whiteoak is surrounded by an obsequious tribe worrying over who will inherit her money . Neither her fuddy-duddy children nor her horsy grandchildren are prepared to see it go to Finch , the family neurotic ( Stephen Haggard ) , and they kick up quite a rumpus when it does . <P> Mazo de la Roche 's Jalna , novels are second-rate Forsyte Saga , gain nothing from being dramatized . As a picture of genteel rapacity , Whiteoaks does nothing in three acts it could not do better in one . Its sharpish characterizations never make up for its dragging plot . Actress Barrymore , looking like a cross between her Brother Lionel and the wolf dressed up as Red Riding Hood 's grandmother , carries the whole play on her bent , centenarian back . Her expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anything a 101-year-old woman says is remarkably witty . <P> All the Living ( adapted by Hardie Albright from the book , I Knew 3,000 Lunatics , by Dr. Victor R. Small ; produced by Cheryl Crawford ) . The theatre , having investigated slums , hospitals and prisons in recent years , last week turned its attention to an insane asylum . All the Living takes a steady , unhysterical look at the inside of an overcrowded , understaffed state institution , makes no attempt to prettify the facts , none to magnify the horrors . The mad , like the sane , have their differing personalities , and in an atmosphere vocally more suggestive of a bird shop than a human habitation . All the Living runs the gamut from a cheerful nut willing to swap the White House for a cigar to sex-tormented schoolteachers and victims of dementia praecox . <P> As a stage picture , the play is restless , intense , a tribute to Director Lee Strasberg 's skill and care . But in an effort to turn honest document into honest-to-God drama , Playwright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balked by his old-fogy superior , lugs in the love of two staff doctors for the same nurse . These concessions to plot bore like termites through the sound timber of the play 's background , leave it rather hollow . <P> Thirty-four-year-old Producer Crawford and 36-year-old Director Strasberg have long worked together . In 1929 they , with Harold Clurman , founded an experimental studio under the auspices of Manhattan 's Theatre Guild , three years later struck out for themselves as the Group Theatre . In the next five years the Group produced such unhackneyed plays as Paul Green 's Johnny Johnson , Sidney Kingsley 's Men in White , Clifford Odets ' Awake &; Sing ! , Waiting for Lefty , Paradise Lost . Several of these plays were directed by Strasberg.
