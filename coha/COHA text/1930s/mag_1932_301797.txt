Jewry does not seek converts . It even discourages those few non-Jews who seek to join . Nevertheless , as sometimes happens , Jewry was petitioned in Warsaw by a Roman Catholic named Antoni-Stefan Raczynski . The Warsaw Rabbinate refused the application , was backed by the Minister of Education who cited a Tsarist ukase of 1905 granting religious liberty save to native Christians who wished to adopt non-Christian faiths . But Pan ( Mr. ) Raczynski appealed his case to the Supreme Administrative Tribunal at Warsaw , which three weeks ago reversed the previous decisions . Let the Rabbinate admit Pan Raczynski . The Tsarist ukase , said the Tribunal , meant " Greek Orthodox " when it said " Christian . " Hence any Roman Catholic , Protestant , Buddhist or whatnot might become a Jew if he wished . <P> Last week The American Jewish World viewed the conversion of Pan Raczynski as a " strange case . " It said : " For centuries it was considered by civil authorities a crime for Jews to accept a Christian convert . At certain periods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a decision of a Supreme Tribunal whose members are probably all Catholics , denying to the Rabbinate the legal right to refuse a Catholic conversion to Judaism . Verily , the world does change ! " <P> Even though conversion has ceased to be a crime , Judaism takes pains to point out to a would-be convert that it prefers to maintain the racial purity of its faith , that its outlook is difficult for a goy to adopt . One finds religious satisfaction best in one 's own group . Unlike Christians , Jews do not seek to save the world . They are satisfied that the souls of righteous men will be taken care of , no matter what their faith. * If , however , a non-Jew is determined to embrace Judaism , and if no ulterior motive ( such as intermarriage ) is evident , he may be accepted by local rabbis , whose decision is , as far as Jewry is concerned , final . <P> Only recorded instance of forcible conversion to Jewry occurred in the 2nd Century B.C. , when John Hyrcanus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rabbis , converted the idolatrous Idumeans . In 740 A.D. the Khazar dynasty in southern Russia , originally pagan , became Jewish . Their kingdom was wiped out in 1016 . Aquila , supposedly related to Emperor Hadrian , became a Jew , translated the Old Testament into Greek . A contemporary convert is French , Catholic-born Poet Aim Pallire . <P> *To The Presbyterian last fortnight wrote a Mrs. Harry Strachan , telling of missioneering in Latin America : " This new venture needs very special prayer . The Catholic priests have sent down to Santa Cruz , where Messrs . Young and Lopez have been working since the end of December , four nuns who are copying exactly our own methods of work . . . . This counter-propaganda will keep many souls out of the Kingdom of Christ . Only prayer can avail ... "
