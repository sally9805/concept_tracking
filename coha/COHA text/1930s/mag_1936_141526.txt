Bishop Hill , Ill. ( pop . 208 ) , site of one of earliest Swedish religious communes in the Midwest , was all astir last week . Carpenters were busily plugging a hole carelessly burned in the Old Colony Church roof last April while townsfolk prepared to feed several thousand visitors next week at a picnic to celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the purchase from the U. S. Government of the Bishop Hill colony 's land . Simultaneously , the attention of U. S. art critics was being called to Bishop Hill because it had just been discovered that the Old Colony Church housed the nation 's largest and hairiest collection of primitive portraits . <P> Early in the 19th Century , a fanatical Swede named Eric Janson founded a cult whose simple theology was based on the single tenet that the Bible was the only book that could properly be used in religious services . Even hymnals were considered by Eric Janson to be worldly gauds . Oppressed in Sweden by orthodox authorities , Eric Janson sent a boatload of his followers to pioneer a colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in mid-Atlantic with all hands . Janson and a second company of his followers succeeded in reaching Illinois in 1846 , purchased their first parcel of 60 acres in Henry County , called the settlement Bishop Hill . <P> Founder Janson passed out of the picture early , being murdered in 1850 by a jealous husband named John Root . The colony 's history thereafter paralleled that of most 19th century U. S. religious Utopias . Disease and crop failure due to unfamiliarity with the land killed off many . Next came a period of self-sufficiency and content , followed by dissatisfaction and dissolution . The colony 's 10,857 communal acres were split up in 1879 . <P> Unlike most ventures of its kind , the Bishop Hill colony left many memorabilia in its wake . The original church , school , blacksmith shop , inn , town hall remain . Thanks to a tipsy Civil War veteran who turned to painting because it was less arduous than horseshoeing , a gallery of 93 oils , among them a stack of portraits of the men who built Bishop Hill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olof Krans whose art was entirely self-taught , began painting the Jansonites . Between drinking bouts he kept at it for years , doing his friends and neighbors in return for enough money to get another bottle . Since the Bishop Hill males happened to be strong individualists who rarely shaved , the resulting gallery is not only historically but barbaryologically noteworthy . <P> Students of the whisker , * noting that not one Bishop Hiller cut his facial hair alike , observed the following beards on the following faces : <P> Artist Krans below his buffalo-horn mustache sported a full goatee , or Imperial . Reaching its greatest glory on the person of Vittorio Emanuele II , this type of whisker was named for the slightly less imposing beard of Napoleon III . <P> Colonist Andrew Stonberg favored the barbiche , a short beard covering the entire chin , currently favored by young Italian Fascisti . <P> The sideburn , burnsides , mutton chops , or cotelette was worn by Colonist Eric Olson . Famed throughout the Civil War period by the air with which General Ambrose Everett Burnside wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is known in Austria as the Kaiser Franz Josef bart .
