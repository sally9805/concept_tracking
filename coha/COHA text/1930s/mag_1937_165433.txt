CHILDREN OF STRANGERS-Lyle Saxon - Houghton Mifflin ( $2.50 ) . <P> Culturally the South still consists of a large group of small islands . Nowhere is this source of confusion to Northerners better dramatized than in the Cane River country of west central Louisiana , locale of Children of Strangers . <P> Settled around 1760 by a rich Frenchman and his New Orleans quadroon mistress , the 60-mile stretch of Cane River land was inherited by " free-mulattoes " who married New Orleans mulattoes , brought in French architects to build their houses , had their portraits painted , owned their own slaves . After the Civil War they had to sell out piecemeal to the present owners and antique-hunters , became sharecroppers . But they held on to their aristocratic traditions . To ward off outsiders , they married among themselves , had illegitimate children by itinerant whites , but kept strictly apart from Negroes . Almost white , fine-featured . French-speaking and Catholic , the 2,000 mulattoes on Cane River 's " Yucca " plantation now share little in common with Negroes except their work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of Children of Strangers is a beautiful , chaste mulatto girl named Famie . Trouble begins when she spies on a red-headed white camper across the river , is seduced by him , but keeps going back . Her romance ends when the sheriff kills her lover , who is wanted for a Texas hold-up murder . After her redheaded , white baby is born she marries the conscience-stricken cousin who tipped off the sheriff after following her one night . But the child is the only thing she has any thought for . Until he is 13 she is still bathing him like a baby . Later to keep him in school in Chicago , she sends him her wages , sells her silver and furniture . The only time she sees him again is when he comes back to collect the money from the last of her land . At 35 , Famie looks like an old woman ; kinfolk have disowned her for selling her land ; her only friend is a big , serious-minded , coal-black field hand . <P> Best parts of Children of Strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local color . Its awkwardness is the result of Author Saxon 's too often hiding Famie 's story while he tells the more dramatic and less sentimental story of Cane River .
