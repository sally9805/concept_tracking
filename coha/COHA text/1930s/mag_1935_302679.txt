Faster than Twentieth Century ( 54.1 m.p.h. ) , faster than the Broadway Limited ( 51.2 m.p.h. ) , faster than the Burlington 's famed Zephyr ( 49.5 m.p.h. ) was the train that Chicago &; North Western Ry , sent over the rails between Chicago and Minneapolis last week . Called The 400 because it covers 400 miles in 400 minutes , North Western 's new train made railroad history by being the fastest train scheduled on the American Continent , fastest in all the world on a stretch over 200 mi . But what made The 400 really significant news was that it was neither lightweight nor streamlined , powered by neither a Diesel nor an electric engine . To all appearances a conventional , standard , all-steel , air-conditioned train , The 400 was hauled by a big , black , puffing steam locomotive . <P> Peacock-proud , North Western splashed big advertisements in Chicago and Manhattan newspapers , plugged The 400 over the radio , announced a forthcoming $1,000 prize contest . To make The 400 possible it had spent $100,000 , a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curves " super-elevated . " Boiler pressure on the locomotive was stepped up , traction increased , oil substituted for coal to eliminate fuel stops . The 400 hit 91 on its maiden trip last week , clipped off 81 mi. in 67 min. , zipped through a ceremonial tape at 85 , snorted into St. Paul 2 hr. 52 min. under the old schedule . <P> Actually , The 400 takes 420 minutes to cover the 410.6 mi. between Chicago and St. Paul , averaging only 58.8 m.p.h . Thirty minutes later The 400 pulls into Minneapolis , making a total run of 450 min . Winner of the Award for Safety among Class A Railroads for the past four years , North Western has no intention of sacrificing safety and comfort for speed , but it is willing to spend money . To operate The 400 costs 95 a mile compared with 75 for regular trains . To the public the fare is the same ( $14.67 round-trip ) . <P> Highly annoyed by North Western 's new train last week was Chicago , Milwaukee , St. Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " jumped the gun " on a gentlemen 's agreement between the Milwaukee , Burlington and North Western to institute high-speed schedules simultaneously next March . Caught napping , the Milwaukee Road quickly inaugurated mile-a-minute service between Chicago and Milwaukee ( 85 mi. ) , pushed delivery of two streamlined engines for its Chicago-Twin Cities route . Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy R. R. quietly announced that it would put two Zephyrs on the Twin Cities run within 60 days , knock 30 minutes off the seven and a half hour schedule of The 400.
