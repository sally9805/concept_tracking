It was cold and partly cloudy in Washington last week when President Roosevelt returned from Warm Springs . Rested after his quietest week since the war began , he stepped off the train to be greeted by a sober-visaged Secretary of State Cordell Hull , flanked by Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles , Assistant Secretary of War Louis Johnson . The President 's quietest week was over , ended by bombs falling on Helsinki by Russia 's invasion of Finland . <P> Cold and clear was the U. S. reaction to Russia 's move . At the White House the President conferred with Statesmen Hull and Welles , spent 45 minutes with Finnish Minister Hjalmar Procope . All day reports of Russian bombings of Helsinki came to the State Department from the U.S. Minister to Finland . At 6 p.m . Mr. Hull got word that in a raid of 15 planes , bombs had fallen near the U. S. legation , that buildings within three blocks were in flames . <P> Next morning the President appealed to both Finland and Russia , said to both : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortified centres of population . . . has sickened the hearts of every civilized man and woman and has profoundly shocked the conscience of humanity . " He requested an immediate reply from both countries . At his press conference the President went further , read in a grave , strained voice : " The news of the Soviet naval and military bombings within Finnish territory has come as a profound shock to the Government and people of the United States . Despite efforts made to solve the dispute by peaceful methods to which no reasonable objection could be offered , one Power has chosen to resort to force of arms . . . . The people and Government of Finland have a long honorable and wholly peaceful record which has won for them the respect and warm regard of the people and the Government of the United States . " Called his strongest statement denouncing the policy of conquest and his strongest denunciation of " wanton disregard of law , " it went beyond his appeals for peace when Hitler invaded Poland . <P> But it lagged far behind U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the German-Russian Pact , that turned into contempt at weird Russian claims of Finnish aggression , flared to new highs , led to loud demands that the U. S. break off diplomatic relations with Russia . Said Senator King of Utah : " My country will no longer grasp the bloody hands of Stalin . " Said Senator Vandenberg : " There is no rational alternative except to drive every trace of Communism and Naziism out of the U. S. " Said Senator Russell of Georgia , " Of all the terrible incidents of this year , this is the most tragic . " Said Nebraska 's Norris , " This is the worst thing that has happened yet . " <P> Driving from Palo Alto to San Francisco , to speak at a dinner of Young Republicans , ex-President Herbert Hoover hurriedly drafted a statement that turned out to be far more effective than the laboriously rewritten speeches that he polishes when he has time . " Civilization has struck a new low with the Communists ' attack on peaceful Finland . It is a sad day to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are back to the morals and butchery of Genghis Khan .
