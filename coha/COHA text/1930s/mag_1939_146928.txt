This week the doors of Manhattan 's garish Grand Central Palace open on the biggest , brightest , costliest annual U. S. coming-out party : The National Automobile Show . For their 40th debut U. S. motormakers have plenty of shiny new models to show , plenty of bright new points to talk about . <P> Every fall the U. S. 's No. 2 industry* buds with optimism . This week it is in full flower . For motormakers 1938 was a hard year ( 4th worst in number of sales since record 1929 ) with profits down as much as 70% , total production little more than half of 1937 . But the close of the 1939 automobile year on September 30 showed : 1 ) profits up moderately ; 2 ) total production of 3,587,000 units ( 4th best year since 1929 ) up 33% over 1938 ; 3 ) new car stocks not over 147,000 units-within 2% of their historic 1938 Sept. 1 low . <P> This cheerful earful accounted for only part of Detroit 's optimism . To most U. S. motormakers 1940 looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above 1939 . With new cars priced a little lower than 1939 's ( but facing possible upward revisions ) , and with the public going strong for the advance models and ordering more , Detroit was sure its new four-wheel debutantes would not be left on the shelf . <P> Most widespread innovation for 1940 are the Sealed-Beam headlights on 95% of the models ( result of cooperation between the industry , lamp &; lens manufacturers ) . Lens , bulb and reflector are sealed into a single unit . The new lamps light the road without blinding . Another big development is the " Hydra-Matic " drive ( see Oldsmobile ) , which dooms the clutch pedal , lets the accelerator control the car . <P> 1940 's beauties ballyhoo a multitude of little things : soft front-seat edges for comfort , better insulation against road-rumble , trigger-release parking brakes , direction signals and warning signals for low gas &; oil , hot motor , faulty ignition , etc . Pointing up comfort , safety , economy , new models are generally longer , lower , wider , roomier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column gearshift relegates to the archives the old wobble-stick . Running boards are mostly optional . Air-conditioned heaters are highly favored . <P> The 1940 list : <P> American Bantam , Tiny Tim of the streamliners ( 75 in. wheelbase ) , enters its third production year with a new Super 4 in two models : coup &; sedan , both convertibles . Prices : $399 to $449 . Boast : " a revolutionary road-cling ride . " <P> Buick has added two new series to its four stand-by straight-eights , claims 70 new mechanical achievements . It is lower , bolder-curved . Down in price from $17 to $281 , it sells for $895 to $2,199 ( lowest price range in company 's history ) . Standard on some models are front &; rear safety direction signals . <P> Cadillac offers 31 models in five series .
