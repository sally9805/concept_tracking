txt Census Bureau 's estimate for consumption of order for curtailment which started the first week in June . 1934 . Looking ahead , the outlook for June is for a consumption by domestic mills of somewhere between 400,000 and 450,000 bales . When curtailment was inaugurated in June , providing for a reduction of the maximum permitted hours for operation of machinery to 60 a week , from 80 , the two-shift mills were probably averaging about 70 hours a week in operation . Making allowance for non-curtailment by mills opeiating one shift , and for exemptions from the curtailment order granted to certain mills , it is probable that the daily rate in June will be reduced about 10% from May , or to 20,600 bales . With 21 working days in the month , this would result in a June consumption of about 433,000 bales . This estimate is based on the assumption that the brisk buying which started in Worth Street a few days ago will continue long enough to keep the mills engaged at the maximum permitted capacity throughout June .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
