Many an American has died in heroic circumstances , but until lately it has not appeared that any North American has performed saintworthy miracles. * ( No one who has not performed at least two miracles , and in addition died an heroic death , is canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church . ) In Vatican City last week , however , the Congregation of Sacred Rites passed by a comfortable majority the credentials of eight New York and Canadian martyrs ( six Jesuits , two laymen ) , and the Holy Office prepared to canonize them as saints . The group was credited with two miracles , and each with an heroic death . <P> In his Jesuit Martyrs of North America meticulous Father John J. Wynne , S.J. , describes with careful detail how the martyrs were tortured in the New York and Canadian woods by Indians who tore out their nails , hair and beards , chewed their fingers , and as one martyr said " even went so far-a savage act-as in cold blood to wound us with their nails , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the body . " Eventually all eight were despatched by the Indians , several with tomahawks . There is no question of the heroic circumstances of their deaths . But many an American has been tomahawked . What miracles did the eight perform ? <P> Father Wynne , who prepared and presented the credentials of the martyrs for canonization , is reticent on this point in his book , but last week the Vatican supplied a clear description . The miracles were performed in virtue of the martyrs collectively less than four years ago . They took the form of cures . The first miracle was that Sister Marie-Maxima of a religious House of St. Hyacinth in Quebec recovered " perfectly and instantaneously " on Dec. 30 , 1927 , from a prolonged attack of tubercular peritonitis . Second miracle was that Sister Savoie of the diocese of Chatham ( Canada ) had on July 9 , 1926 , a cure , also perfecta et instantanea , of prolonged tubercular peritonitis . <P> * South American Saints include : St. Rose of Lima , Peru , first all American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Francis Solano. also of Lima ( " The Wonder Worker of the New World " ) ; St. Peter Claver ( baptized 300,000 South American Negroes ) ; St. Toribio ( Archbishop of Lima ) .
