The agreement on the budget came after many weeks of wrangling in which many plans were made by both sides to obtain some political advantage . Soon after the Governor submitted his $216,000,000 budget the Assembly Republicans demanded wholesale reductions . Many conferences were held and a drastic program for salary cuts and large scale reduction in the items for many State services was seriously considered .
