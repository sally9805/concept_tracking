" This is one of the most important domestic problems in American life . ... There are many cities and towns now where the local C. I. O. and A. F. of L. are ... in closest harmony . . . . The two factions , as they are called , are really not factions . They realize that their interests are the same . I accept the premise that both sides want peace . ... I am counting on you to succeed . . . . " <P> With this little fight talk Franklin Roosevelt last week warmed up A. F. of L. 's and C. I. O. 's peace negotiators . The six-A . F. of L. 's Harry Bates , Matthew Woll , Tom Rickert ; C. I. O. 's John Lewis , Philip Murray , Sidney Hillman - and Madam Secretary Perkins listened respectfully . But Franklin Roosevelt as he addressed them at the White House before the beginning of their labors must have been pretty certain that most of them had their fingers crossed . <P> A. F. of L. 's President William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that nothing could happen was C. I. O. 's Lewis that he dared to get funny . No sooner had the President concluded than John Lewis handed to Franklin Roosevelt , Fanny Perkins and the Federation committeemen a mimeographed document , proposing that : <P> 1 ) A new American Congress of Labor " supersede and embrace " A. F. of L. , C. I. 0. , and the hitherto independent Big Four railroad brotherhoods ( Engineers , Firemen &; Enginemen , Railway Conductors , Trainmen ) . <P> 2 ) Messrs . Green &; Lewis be barred from any office , reserving the presidency for a railway brother like Trainman A. F. Whitney or Engineman David Brown Robertson . <P> 3 ) A. F. of L. 's Green and its veteran Secretary-Treasurer Frank Morrison be guaranteed their salaries for life " for services rendered . " <P> 4 ) C. L O. and A. F. of L. between April 15 and April 30 pass on the plan at special conventions , to be followed " not later than June 1 , 1939 " by a joint convention with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Daughters of the American Revolution " ( who last year barred Mr. Lewis ' United Mine Workers from Constitution Hall ) . <P> 5 ) With the " cooperative mediation " of the U. S. Department of Labor , jurisdictional disputes between competing A. F. of L. and C. I. O. unions should be settled after they enter the Congress . <P> 6 ) Franklin Roosevelt himself should preside at the first session of the Congress . <P> The President tossed Mr. Lewis ' paper aside , declared an hour later that he did not know its contents . Fanny Perkins and Messrs . Woll , Bates &; Rickert , hurriedly scanning it , did not hide their feeling that John Lewis had pulled a fast one on them and on Franklin Roosevelt . When they emerged a reporter queried Mr. Lewis : " I see you 've taken care of Bill Green . How about yourself ? " <P> " Oh , I 'll go on WPA , " quipped John Lewis , who draws no pay from C. I. O. but has $25,000 a year from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's negotiators ( after telephoning Bill Green at Coshocton ) : " . . . The C. I. O. proposal does not offer any possible solution . . . . We are convinced that it was not even designed for serious consideration . . . . "
