I KNEW HITLER-Kurt G. W. Ludecke - Scribner ( $3.75 ) . <P> In the harassed early days when Kurt Ludecke was about the only Nazi who had plenty of spending money , his good cronies Hitler and other future Nazi big shots called him " Der Amerikaner . " This nickname came from his familiarity with the U. S. , his smart clothes , wrist watch , nervy wit . He was , said Hitler , half-facetiously refusing him permission to make soapbox speeches , ' ' too much of a swell . ' ' Later , when Nazi officials had limousines and champagne , the nickname still stuck-but with a shadier meaning , derived partly from Ludecke 's too thoughtful awareness of U. S. anti-Nazi opinion . " A strange bird , " Hitler now said , " a good head , but a dangerous brother ! " <P> As Hitler 's confidential agent . Kurt Ludecke managed the first meeting between Hitler and Mussolini , headed the first Nazi propaganda missions abroad , the Nazi press bureau in Washington , and in I Knew Hitler now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they could barely afford paste for posters .

In Detroit he married a plain , sensible librarian . <P> Back in Germany , Ludecke did his aggressive best to keep Hitler out of bad company ( Goring , Goebbels , Hindenburg , the industrialists ) , thought Roehm and Strasser the likely ones to help him . This proved a bad guess , and in 1933 Ludecke found himself in disfavor .
