txt The Bethlehem Steel Corporation 's bonus plan , under which officers received approximately $36,000,000 in fourteen years and which is being fought in the courts by a minority group , was apparently ratified overwhelmingly yesterday at the annual meeting of the stockholders in Newark . While a restraining order by Vice Chancellor Backes in Trenton prohibited the stockholders from announcing the result of their vote Or recording it pending a determination of the minority stockholders ' suit , the management announced that it was voting proxies representing 72 per cent of the outstanding common and preferred stock of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation . So it was assumed that the management had won approval of the bonus system , which in one year added to the $12,000 salary of Eugene G. Grace , president , the sum of $1,625,753 . Schwab Backs System . Responsibility for the bonus system of the corporation was assumed by Charles M. Schwab , chairman , who maintained that the additional sum to the management was not a " gratuity , " which would be an insult , but rather " part payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veteran chairman of Bethlehem parried thrusts so skillfully that even his opponents sometimes joined in the applause that greeted his repartee and his sallies . His black eyes flashing and a smile of sureness playing around his lips , Mr. Schwab had a ready answer for William Gilman , director of the Jefferson County National Bank of Watertown , when he wanted to know why Mr. Grace , with his huge bonus , should have received for his services to the comparatively small body of stockholders of the corporation more than the President of the United States gets for his services to the people of the country . " I appreciate your sincerity , " said Mr. Schwab . " I only object to your comparison of Grace 's salary to the President 's . The United States Government is not a business enterprise , but I would give five times $75,000 a year to be President of the United States . " At one point of his address Mr. Schwab said that the bonus system as he had originated it for Bethlehem was designed not so much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had placed Mr. Grace " upon a pedestal , " so that he would have to live up to his high position for the good of the corporation . He asserted that he had learned the lesson of large rewards to produce large returns from his old employer and mentor , the late Andrew Carnegie , who said that it was necessary to make men feel big and act big to accomplish big things . Mr. Schwab disclosed that for the first seven years after he organized Bethlehem Steel Corporation he had not only backed the undertaking with his entire fortune , as he later did through many crises , but that he had served as its head without compensation . He was answering the question he said he heard people often ask : " What does C. M. get out of it ? " " I have been the highest paid man in the United States for a good many years , " said Mr. Schwab . " Some years my compensation was in figures that would stagger you . Now I want you to remember that I risked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1918 . Since 1908 I have received an aver age from this corporation of $86,000 a year . " After explaining that he had worked without salary from 1901 to 1907 , Mr. Schwab said he drew a salary as president of $50,000 from 1908 to 1920 . From 1921 to 1929 he received a salary of $150,000 a year as chairman . " In 1930 the board of directors without my presence or knowledge voted me $250,000 . " Now I 'm damned , " said Mr. Schwab in a humorous vein . " if I ai n't going to get a salary commensurate with my services . " In view of his long struggles to build up the Bethlehem Corporation , and in view of his intimate knowledge of evry phase of the steel industry , Mr. Schwab asked the stockholders who had the " best right " to say whether the Bethlehem system of bonuses was right or wrong . Stumped by Question . Only once or twice did Mr. Schwab find himself in a tight corner . He could not find a ready answer for Elbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to know why the management waited fourteen years to ask the stockholders to ratify a bonus plan , which was not called to their attention until last year in the litigation over the proposed purchase of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Corporation by Bethlehem . " I have been a small stockholder of Bethlehem Steel Corporation for several years , " said Mr. Miller , " and in that time I have attended a majority of the stockholders ' meetings , but I never heard of the bonus plan until I read of it in the newspaper accounts of the Youngstown litigation . " Why , after fourteen years , are we now asked to ratify it ? " " I cant answer that ; it seems to be a legal question , " said Mr. Schwab . At another point , Henry A. Holthusen , 11 Broadway , of counsel for the minority stockholders , asked Mr. Schwab why the bonus system of the corporation had been kept secret . Mr. Schwab did not answer that question immediately , but later he said that every stockholder had access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted an 8 per cent limit for bonuses and upon further inquiry could have ascertained how it was distributed . He asserted , however , that the directors kept the bonuses secret from the beneficiaries because they thought it was a poor policy to have one executive dissatisfied because some other executive received a larger bonus . In reply to a question by another stockholder who gave his name as White , and said he lived in Montclair , Mr. Schwab defended the bonus system as one that produced results in the executive departments , and maintained that it cost the Bethlehem Steel Corporation only 3.25 per cent of sales receipts to maintain its executive branch , as against 3.84 per cent of the United States Steel Corporation . In a formal address which he read , I Mr. Schwab explained that 50 per cent of the employes of Bethlehem worked under a form of extra compensation . At one point of his exchanges with the stockholders he admitted that there was truth in an observation made by THE NEW YORK TIMES that in allowing the bonuses to the management he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had conducted it thirty years ago . Replies to Critics . " It seems to me , " he went on , " that those who have criticized me because of the awards that I have made under our bonus system ( and I must admit that there are some who have criticized me , although I am bound to say that I think the criticism is unmerited ) are looking at the awards after the results have been accomplished rather than from the point of view of the results to be accomplished by them . I want the gentlemen to get that point . Believing as I do in the incentive system of compensation , I naturally favor a system which affords an incentive at all times , and I think that it is particularly important to have such an incentive operate in hard times like the present , when it iq especially important to keep down all expenses . " Just what is a proper provision for depreciation of the property account of any corporation is to a considerable extent a matter of opinion . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system were to be established based upon earnings after depreciation , it would of necessity create an incentive upon the management to keep depreciation charges as low as could be reasonably justified in order that the earnings reported upon the stock would be correspondingly increased . " Mr. Schwab pointed out that in 1917-1918 , when the Federal tax rates were particularly high , the management charged off to depreciation $31,510,366 , and continued : " I think it is no exaggeration to say that the saving in taxes during the war years as a result of charging liberally for depreciation rather than deducting the depreciation charges which might have been justified as normal would have been more than half the entire executive bonuses paid by Bethlehem during the last thirteen years . " While the illustration that I have used relates primarily to the conditions during the war and the exceptionally high tax rates then in effect , the same thing holds true , though to a lesser extent , today , because whatever is charged today for depreciation reduces to that extent the net income of the corporation subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal taxes of $125,000 in cash for every $1,000,000 of depreciation . This saving is made for the benefit of the corporation and does not in any way hurt its stockholders . Even if bonus payments at the rate of 8 per cent were paid on such $1 , - 000,000 , there would still be a saving for the corporation of $45,000 . " He Explains Payment . Mr. - chwab answered criticisms by the protective committee that bonuses paid up to the close of 1928 were $31,878,255 , as against $40 , - 886.996 . " These amounts , disregarding the 200 per cent stock dividend that was paid in 1917 , are not quite correct , " he said . " If any comparison is to be made , it is a ' comparison of the amounts of bonuses paid with the amounts of earnings , and it would seem that the period from 1918 to 1930 , inclusive , would he a fairer period than the one selected by the committee . During those years the results were as follows : The total executive bonuses paid to twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any one year ) was $25,151,218 . The total earnings available for dividends ( preferred and common ) , after deducting such bonus payments , was $218.577 , - 368 . The total amount paid in cash dividends on the preferred stock was $63,191,530 , and on the common stock $60,121,300 , or total dividends of $123 , - 312,830 . The total amount , therefore , that was added to surplus ( thus increasing the equity of the common stock ) was $95,264,538 . " Now that I have answered those two questions , does any one have any others ? " Plea for Approval . Frequently referring to himself as " the old man , " Mr. Schwab spoke with a quavering voice toward the end of his address when he said : " The crowning star in the diadem of long steel management is the approval that people give to what you 've done . The old man wo n't be with you many more years  --  and I am not appealing on the ground of personality  --  but he would like to add to his diadem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done . Thank you for your patience and God bless and prosper you all . " Mr. Schwab was applauded loudly and at frequent intervals by more than 400 stockholders in the ballroom of the Robert Treat Hotel , to which the meeting was adjourned from the directors ' room of the Fidelity Union Trust Company , 755 Broad Street , a room that was entirely too small for the number of stockholders . When Mr. Schwab took his seat at the table in the directors ' room he noticed one of the women stockholders standing . " Lady , have n't you a chair ? " asked Mr. Schwab with his usual gallantry and offered her his own . " I prefer to stand and get a good look at you , " said the woman with a display of temper . " Then I 'll stand so you may see me better , " said Mr. Schwab , rising and bowing . " Do n't trouble . I saw your picture in the paper playing golf at White Sulphur Springs , " said the woman . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smiling rejoinder . " That 's open to question , " said Mr. Grace , sitting on Mr. Schwab 's right , while the woman chimed : " You may think so , but I do n't . " Mr. Schwab laughed . The woman refused several times to disclose her identity , at one point saying she was " a cranky rich woman , " and at another time , " I 'd lose my job if my identity were known . " At the adjourned meeting at the hotel , Mr. Grace , presiding , announced that the corporation was operating at about 50 per cent of capacity and that it had not been forced to reduce wages . R. E. , vice president and secretary of the corporation , announced that the management had obtained proxies of 52,567 stockholders having 3,023,086 shares of common and preferred stock divided as follows : 30,403 stockholders holding 2,288,357 thares of common out of 3.200,000 outstanding , and 23,464 having 734.729 preferred shares out of 1,000,000 outstanding . Thus the management figures that it held proxies for 72 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ehrich , one of the attorneys representing the Protective Committee , announced that he held proxies of 11.684 stockholders representing 376,990 shares of common stock , and 5,328 stockholders having 110,053 , or a total of 487,043 shares of common and preferred . The president received the renomination of Wiliam E. Corey , Eugene G. Grace , Grayson M.-P . Murphy , F. A. Shick and James H , Ward , as directors , their terms expiring in 1931 . Morrison D. Collier , Winant Vanderpool and Gordon D. Whiting were appointed as inspectors of election . Votes were cast for the election of the five directors , for ratification of all the acts of the directors since the last annual meeting , for approval of the bonus system , and for other miscellaneous business . Adjourn to Today . The meeting was recef  --  sed at 7 P. M. until 11 P. M. , while the election inspectors began canvassing the vote . and was adjourned until 10 o'clock this morning because the by-laws of the corporation provide that the canvassers may not continue their count of the votes unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the minority stockholders for a very thorough canvass of the votes , it was said that two or three weeks might be required to complete the canvass . The order signed by Vice-Chancellor Backes permitted the stockholders to cast their votes upon the resolution approving the bonus system and to tabulate the votes , was read at the meeting of stockholders by the secretary on motion of the minority stockholders . The minority stockholders had brought suit to halt any action by the stockholders on the bonus system , while the court was asked to pass upon the stockholders ' demands for the return of all of the $36,000,000 aggregate bonus or any part of it that the court might determine . Referring to the stockholders ' meeting in his opinion , Vice-Chancellor Backes said : " It will be a battle of proxies , not of wits . It is a foregone conclusion that if the management has a majority the resolution will be passed , regardless of the chairman 's explanation , for the management proxy holders have no discretion  --  their proxies read to vote approval only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears not allowed to hear and minds not permitted to judge : upon automatons , whose principals are uninformed of their own injury , if the charges of the bill are well founded , and incapable of appraising the rights of their fellow-stockholders or to bind them by the majority rule . " What the defendants expect to gain by the resolution is not apparent . Probative value of an overwhelming affirmative vote would not avail them , for the vote could have no influence upon the right to relief of even a single shareholder who suffered injury by unlawful conduct . Obviously , the resolution of a majority can not force a complaining minority into suppression of their rights nor find in it immunity . "
