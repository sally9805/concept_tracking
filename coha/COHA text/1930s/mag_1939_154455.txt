Since 1935 the U. S. people have acted like a man who saves for his old age , borrows from his savings to meet current expenses , and fills his hope chest with notes payable by himself to himself . Up to the first of this year , they had laid by $1,131,000,000 in Social Security 's old age reserve fund which invested it in the people 's own promises to pay ( U. S. bonds and Treasury notes ) . <P> Last week Franklin Roosevelt and his fiscal servant , Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. , at last recognized this fundamental fallacy of the Social Security Act and asked Congress to correct it . <P> Social Security having paid out only $11,000,000 on old-age benefits ( to Dec. 31 last ) is rapidly piling up a huge reserve . By 1980 , as the act now reads , the reserve would amount to $47,000,000,000 ( about seven times the amount of money now circulating in the U. S. ) . <P> Among numerous blasts at this astronomic dream was the report of Economist James Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That council , representing Government , Labor and the Public , recommended that in order to hold down the reserve , Social Security call a temporary halt to rate increases , begin payments of full benefits in 1940 instead of 1942 , and extend them to more people . Last week , in a report to the House Ways &; Means Committee , Henry Morgenthau said nothing about speeding up payments . But he did approve another suggestion : to give up the idea of " full reserve " and substitute a much smaller " contingency fund . " * <P> The President in press conference suggested that $2,500,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 should be enough for the new contingency fund . Henry Morgenthau , foreseeing that the total will vary , guessed it ought to reach $4,500,000,000 by 1955 . <P> This would amount to putting Social Security largely on a collect-as-you-pay basis . Henry Morgenthau warned that the change may well mean higher payroll taxes than those now planned to peak at 3% each on employes and employers in 1949 . To even matters up he took another suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. Government should share the burden with employers and employes ; that is , meet part of the expense by indirect rather than direct taxes on prospective beneficiaries . <P> Since he did not propose increasing at once the amounts paid out for old age benefits , Mr. Morgenthau had to take the one other method of keeping the reserve fund down . Granting that payroll taxes might be slowing Recovery , he proposed either to reduce the rate of increase in old-age levies ( scheduled to rise next January from 1% to 1% on employers and employes ) , or to postpone any increase at all until 1943 . That seemed just as pleasing to Congress , just as appeasing to business , as correcting a bad boner in the Social Security Act . <P> <P> * He also suggested that control of the fund be shifted from the Treasury to a " trusteeship " composed of the chairman of the Social Security Board and the Secretaries of Labor and the Treasury .                @ @ @ @ @
