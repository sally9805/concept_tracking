DEATH SAILS WITH MAGELLAN - Charles Ford-Random House ( $2.50 ) . <P> Off the Islands of the Kings ( Guam ) . . . we found a Gallegan whose name was Gonzalo of Vigo who said he had been left in those lands for seven years . . . . He stayed with the midnight watch and showed the pilot the course . . . was seen no more . Because of this some of the seamen grew afraid and said a ghost of one of Magellan 's sailors had come aboard . . . . <P> This provocative passage , encountered ten years ago in . an obscure account of early voyages in the Pacific , set Author Ford , a New York adman , romancing , researching , buttonholing his friends . By last week he had salted his tale down on paper . An ingenious circumstantial account , running to 363 close-type pages , of how and why his hero landed on Guam , Death Sails With Magellan is about equally divided between Magellan 's voyage and Gonzalo 's castaway life among the handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mutiny on the Bounty , which it resembles in its melodramatic plot and realistic detail , it will as certainly annoy those who feel that Magellan was the equal of Columbus , Marco Polo and Henry the Navigator . Author Ford melodramatizes the tiny , lame , yellow-skinned Portuguese explorer as a cold-blooded sadist whose only real genius lay in the grandiose scope of his malevolence . <P> To the husky , sharp-witted Vigo fisherman Gonzalo , as to most other Spaniards , Magellan 's reputation was ugly . When the rumor got out that his secretive expedition would carry only Portuguese seamen , Magellan tried to stop the angry clamor with bullets , finally took long three Spanish captains . Chosen for their politics rather than their seamanship , they gave him much less opposition than the Basque ship 's master , Sebastian del Cano ( who with 34 survivors with the only officer to get back to Spain ) and del Cano 's young protege Gonzalo . If these two , says Author Ford , had been listened to , the voyage would have ended very differently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gonzalo discovered before long that Magellan 's real aim was to sail secretly over the Portuguese route to the East Indies , seize a rich island kingdom , set up in the king business for himself .
