txt A State deficit greater than his previous $29,000,000 estimate was predicted by Governor Lehman today in an addeess at the commencement exercises of Hamilton College . He based his forecast on " disappointing tax returns " in the face of " increased requirements for the essential activities of government . " He said that , in view of the curtailed funds available , State expenditures must be scrutinized to see that the services provided are conducive to real economic or social progress . " By and large , people are going to get just the kind of government they want and deserve , " he declared . " If public officials feel there is a wide circle of people interested in their work , critical of results and ready to praise and reward faithful service , or condemn inefficiency and dishonesty , they are going to render good service . " Conversely , indifference or ignorance on the part of the public will , almost inevitably , lead to service that is indifferent if not worse . " Sounds Note of Confidence .

" The Governor received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws . In conferring the degree , Dr. Frederick Carlos Ferry , president of the college , said : " Herbert Henry Lehman , graduate of Williams College ; by profession a banker , making in the financial world a reputation over which no cloud of suspicion has ever hovered ; generous of effort and of means to a host of worthy charities ; earnest student of civic affairs ; now Governor of the State of New York , making the sphere of politics a better place through your high character , your purity of purpose , your devotion to duty and your controlling sense of the public interest  --  by the authority committed to me , I confer on you the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were conferred . Elihu Root , as chairman of the board of trustees , attended the ceremonies . " A Natural Evolution . " Governor Lehman 's address was in part as follows : " The world has probably changed more during the last twenty years than in ' any period in modern history . To us of the older generation the changes frequently seem revolutionary . To you they should mark only a natural evolution and one in which we may well have confidence . " People are today doing their own thinking . They are not willing to accept the standards or the fetishes of past generations . All the countless questions which affect business , the professions and public service have directed the attention of the progressive and liberal leader to matters which twenty , or even ten , years ago would have been entirely outside the sphere of his interest . ' Urges Political Interest . " Obviously , not every one can or will want to take an active part in government , but certainly every man and woman alike can be interested in and become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing is so discouraging to a conscientious public servant as apathy , ignorance or indifference as to what he is trying to accomplish . By and large , people are going to get just the kind of government they want and deserve . If public officials feel that there is a wide circle of people interested in their work , critical of results and ready to praise and reward faithful service , or condemn inefficiency and dishonesty , they are going to render good service . Conversely , indifference or ignorance on the part of the public will , almost inevitably , lead to service that is indifferent if not worse . " Government , like business , must have the confidence and good-will of the public , based on accomplishment and sound administration . It needs the cooperation and support of an intelligent public , and a college should teach its students that interest in government is a requisite of good citizenship . Cites Lack of Basic Income . " Unlike private enterprises , neither the nation , the State nor the smaller governmental units have any earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their income , which makes possible the carrying on of government , comes wholly and exclusively from taxes paid by the people themselves . We must not , therefore , even in our desire to make social progress rapidly , overlook the ability of the community to carry the additional burden that the development of social progress usually imposes on a community . New undertakings and increased activities must be paid for . We do not get things in this life for nothing . " In the face of increased requirements for the essential activities of government , the State is faced with continued difficulty in securing funds necessary to balance its budget without imposing an unreasonable and insupportable burden of taxation . I have previously stated on a number of occasions that the collection of State taxes for the current fiscal year has been disappointing and shows rather conclusively the great shrinkage in income and earnings that obtained during the calendar year of 1933 . " In submitting the executive budget to the Legislaure I estimated that after the amendment of the so-called ' 1 per cent gross indome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full personal exemptions , we would end the current fiscal year with an estimated deficit of about $29,000,000 , to be made up by taxes provided for and to be collected during the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1935 . " The outlook for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1935 , in my opinion , remains substantially unchanged , but the deficit at the end of the current year will be very considerably larger than expected , because of disappointing tax returns . The personal income taxes collected this year , but based , of course , on 1933 incomes , will alone show a falling off of about $16,000,000 from estimates . There are other substantial decreases in tax returns , particularly in the corporation tax , stock transfer tax , motor vehicle and gasoline taxes , and the alcoholic beverage tax . Predicts Increased Deficit . " The result of these disappointing tax returns is that the deficit for the current year ending June 30 , 1934 , will be very considerably larger than was estimated some months ago . " Unlike municipalities , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , even though payment may be greatly delayed , the State suffers a permanent and irretrievable loss if taxes bring in a return less than estimated . " In other words , if the returns from taxes such as the personal income tax , corporation tax , stock transfer tax or gasoline tax , or other earnings or business taxes , fall below estimates in any one year they can not be collected at a later date , save in a very minor degree , nor can they be considered as an asset of the State . They just drop out of the picture , and failure to collect them creates a deficit , which must.be added to the budget of the next succeeding year . " To show the difficulty of eestimating returns from any specific tax based on income or business activity , I need only cite that thb collections from the stock transfer tax , one of the most important in the State 's budget , decreased from a high of over $8,000,000 in August of 1933 to about $1,500,000 in May , 1934 . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both increased requirements for government and decreased revenues from taxes , that the greatest care must be used by the State , at least for the present , in selecting those activities which are of really essential character , and of limiting expenditures generally , so far as they can be limited without affecting the essential services of government .
