ARMY &; NAVY <P> Out of Miami , across the Caribbean , over Panama , down the west coast of South America , over the Andes , and into El Palomar airport at Buenos Aires last week roared six of the U. S. Army 's new flying fortresses-four-motored bombers each manned by eight men . They had made the 5,225-mile flight in record time ( 34 hr. 14 min. ) with only one stop at Lima , Peru . Purpose of the longest " good will " flight in Army aviation records was to represent the U. S. at the inauguration of Argentine President Roberto M. Ortiz ( see p. 24 ) - conveniently scheduled three weeks after the good will flight of three Italian planes to Rio de Janeiro . <P> The Italian good will flight had been a mild fiasco . To avoid appearing Fascist-minded , the Brazilian Government gave the fliers a cool welcome . Meanwhile , the Buenos Aires Critica , chief anti-Fascist organ of the Argentine press , decried the flight so bitterly that Argentina was omitted from the itinerary . <P> By contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The planes reached Buenos Aires , got a warm welcome from President Ortiz , awed his capital by flying over it in formation during the inauguration . Cried the delighted Critica , under an eight-column streamer headline designed to suggest the U. S. flag : " Welcome to the aviators of Democracy . . . . None has bombarded cities ; none has spread horror and death among women and children . . . nothing connected with their splendid trip is in any way suggestive of the spirit that has brought others fliers to these shores . "
