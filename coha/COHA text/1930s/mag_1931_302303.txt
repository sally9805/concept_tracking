ON THE EDGE-Walter de la Mare-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> Even in his poetry Walter de la Mare traffics in the spooky , but in spooks of a gossamer , indefinite kind . He understands that an effective ghost is never concrete . On the Edge contains many a tale that will give you the creeps , some that will merely set you musing . Some of them : <P> An eccentric old gentleman who infests a most attractive old country house invites a casual stranger to spend the night . It turns out the old gentleman is a student of the occult ; the stranger takes no stock in such truck , but before the night is over he changes his mind . <P> A Uriah-Heepish butler sets the gardener and the houseman at such odds that they come to blows . When the gardener is discharged he hangs himself . But he promises to come back , and one threatening night the butler sends the houseman outside to see what is there . He never returns . <P> A young man partly blind meets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her though he can not see her face . But she is unable to stand up before his formidable Grandmamma , and their strange idyll is ephemeral . <P> Browsing in an old bookshop , a young litterateur discovers a manuscript book of poems . The authoress , who once lived in the house , comes to haunt him ; his publication of the poems nearly leads him into a nasty death . <P> A young London bank clerk ( this story is in the nature of comic relief ) , just fired for incompetence , celebrates with an orgy of shopping , orders everything sent to a vacant house , the bill to his peppery uncle ; by some miracle escapes arrest . <P> De la Mare never speaks out , never clothes his spooks in a simple declarative manner . They might be merely states of mind , queer tricks of sensation , strange coincidences . There is nothing solid in this dank mistiness that you can lay your finger on , but you feel it . Sometimes it chills you to the bone . <P> The Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet , anthologist , editor and bedtime-verse-writer ( he is most widely known for his children 's verse &; tales ) , has written many a prose book which critics rank as high as any of his verse . An enthusiastic fictioneer , he sometimes lectures on the art . Married , he has four children , lives in London . Other books : Songs of Childhood , Poems , The Listeners and Other Poems , The Return , Peacock Pie , The Veil and Other Poems , The Riddle and Other Stories .
