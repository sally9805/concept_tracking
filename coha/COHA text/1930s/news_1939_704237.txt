txt With a month of war and a month of the new amusement fiscal year behind them , moving picture executives are beginning to appraise the effects of the European conflict on their business . The situation of the leading companies in the field varies considerably , but genera'ly speaking the damage will not be as bad as was feared at first . L.oe ? ' s. for example , largest of the film producers , depending on foreign sales for around 35% of its gross film income , will probably be able to show 75 cents to $1 a share for its quarter ending November 25 against $1.74 a snare earned in the corresponding 1938 quarter . Situation Relative to Paramount Paramount , which has the income from about 1,000 American theatres to stabilize its earnings , gets less than 10 , , of its total gross . including theatres and film rentals , from foreign sales . Thus , even it half of its foreign Income ize lost , the drop in revenue could be made up by a moderate improvement in domestic rentals Warner Brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed as Paramount and has been getting more income from abroad since its pictures have been better Twentieth Century-Fox owns no theatres directly and has an annual film gross of around $50,000,000 to $55.000.000 . Assuming 30% of this , or roughly $15,000.000 comes from foreign sales , around half of this or $7.500,000 comes from Great Britain . Smaller producers like Columbia and Universal are in the most unfavorable situation of all . Great Britain and its situation in war ttnae is. of course , the key to the problem of current moving picture profits and obviously estimates of earnings at the moment can only be conJectures . The situation may be summed up about as follows : American film producers obtain about 30% to 35% of their total film rentals from abroad . This varies somewhat from year to year . Around half of the fore.gn Income , that is 15% to 17% of the total , comes from Great Britain . South America supplies 10 , - , ; , to 13% and the rest is scattered . The Continent of Europe . due to government regulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Decline Smaller in Second Week During the first week of September the experience of one leading producer shows that British film rental income was off about 50% , while in the second week it declined only about 40% . It is regarded as probable that when things settle down . income from Great Britain will show a decline of 20% to 30% . This is , of course , assuming that Britain is not demoralized by destructive air raid &; Of course , the estimates of the decline in British revenue do not take into account the depreciation of around 15% in sterling exchangeHowever . Loew 's , Paramount and Warner have all hedged their foreign income for some months ahead by short positions in the pound made well before the war began so that exchange losses will not be an important factor during the remainder of this year . Roughly speaking , companies dependent mainly on film income consider that Great Britain 's gross is about equal to their profit . Loss of all this would mean breaking even on operations with little or no net income . Correspondingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will mean a drop of about that amount in net earnings . But film executives point out that in war time people crave amusement more than ever , and that all European production has been abandoned , leaving all world markets , both in America and in Europe . open to Hollywood films . As a result of the sharp drop in revenues all producers are drastically cutting expenses and revising production budgets downward as far as possible without hurting the quality of the film output . It has never been easy for New ' ork to persuade Hollywood to watch the pennies and consequently New York financial managements feel that the war may eventually prove a blessing in disguise . since the need for economizing is so obvious and so stringent . Room for Economies Annual production budgets of $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 offer plenty of room for cutting down . Economics are expected to take the form of lower executive salaries and fewer major films costing in the $1,500,000 to $2.000 , - 000 range . Films in the upper cost brackets are generally aimed at foreign rather than domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting down on this type of film . Loew 's , for example , made " Marie Antoinette " and " Conquest " , two spectacular historical films in this class in the last year or so , and although they did only fairly well in this country , they made new records in South America and brought large rentals from Great Britain . Doing without two films of this type would save Loew 's 34,000,000 or more . Meanwhile , if war is prolonged the sharp pick-up in domestic industrial activity , increased employment and buying power will almost certainly bring a considerable gam in box office income over here .
