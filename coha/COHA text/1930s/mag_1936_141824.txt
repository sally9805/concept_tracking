Two days before hunting season opened . Farmer Joe Mitt placed the following advertisement in a Shelby , Ohio newspaper : <P> " Invitation to hunters ! Hunting is allowed on my farm southeast of Shelby . There are plenty of rabbits and pheasants and no danger to dogs of hog cholera . If you do n't get the limit of rabbits , shoot a couple of my chickens to make up the number you lack . If you get hungry while hunting on my farm , come up to the house for a hand-out.
