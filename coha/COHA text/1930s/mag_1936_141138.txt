The carpenters were still pounding , the painters still painting , the sign saying " This Is A WPA Job " was still on " the sidewalk in front of Cleveland 's Public Hall , when the preliminaries of the Republican National Convention got under way . For Republicans were in such a hurry last week that they overflowed Cleveland long before their convention began . More eager than animals to get aboard the Ark before the Flood , politicians came in , not two by two , but ten by ten . <P> Euclid Avenue was filled with old familiar faces , some of whom Cleveland had not seen since 1924 when her new Public Hall needed no WPA renovation and Calvin Coolidge was nominated . C. Bascom Slemp from Virginia , David A. Reed from Pennsylvania , Ralph E. Williams from Oregon , Walter F. Brown from nearby Toledo , Jim Watson over the border from Indiana , Charles G. Dawes from Chicago , came trooping in . So did the Elephant 's ladies , Alice Longworth from Cincinnati , Ruth Hanna McCormick Simms , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crowds seethed in hotel lobbies . Fat men sweated in hotel rooms . Newshawks scuffled after rumors . Whiskey went down and fines went up . <P> Onetime Senator George Higgins Moses from New Hampshire rushed about making statements to stir up enthusiasm for Candidate Frank Knox . Bald-domed Carl Bachmann from West Virginia bustled for Candidate Borah . But the spotlight burned steadily on the sleek , curly head of young John Hamilton , manager for Alf Landon . Perched on the back of an overstuffed chair in Cleveland 's old-fashioned Hollenden Hotel , Hamilton had the Press basking at his feet as he announced that Landon would have over 300-no-over 400 votes , perhaps a majority ( 502 votes ) on the first ballot . <P> Through a fantastic pre-convention week Hamilton drove a bandwagon . Nothing was news unless it bore the name of Landon . A majority of Pennsylvania delegates would plump for Landon . All the Old Guard politicians were conspiring in vain to ' ' Stop Landon . " Indiana 's State Convention picked its delegates , tagged them Landon . Emporia 's sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roamed the streets wearing yellow sunflowers inscribed " Landon . " The Texas delegation came out , all over again , for Landon . <P> A trio of crooners began to sing Oh ! Susanna , but the words were : <P> Our Ship of State is on the Rocks And soon it will be sunk . It has no pilot at the wheel But regimented Bunk . It wanders to the right and left , It flounders all around . It needs a Captain on the Bridge Whose reckoning is sound . London , Oh ! Landon , will lead to Victory , With the dear old Constitution And it 's good enough for me. *
