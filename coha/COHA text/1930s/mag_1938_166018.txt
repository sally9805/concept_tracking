Twenty-six New York City cloth merchants rubbed their hands joyfully last month when the city ordered $67,092 worth of woolen goods to be made into winter coats for needy women &; children by WPA workers . Last week city inspectors rejected half the cloth submitted . Twenty merchants had supplied good goods . Six others , with the bulk of the orders , had tried to palm off material containing moth holes , streaks , bare places , weak spots . Angered , Comptroller Joseph D. McGoldrick gave the six a chance to make good before publishing their names . Still hopeful , one shyster took back his shoddy , resubmitted it as a new delivery .
