txt Suggesting an Airport Site To the Editor of The New York Times : I notice that the city is planning to spend about $1,500,000 for the purchase of land in the North Beach section for an airport and some $12,000,000 to develop it . In the study of a park map of the Borough of Queens you will notice that practically all the parks are on the North Shore of Queens , where the land values are the highest , and there are practically no parks on the south side of Queens in the Jamaica Bay area , where there is so much cheap and vacant land and has the advantage of being on the water . An airport , for instance , would be better in the Jamaica Bay area , where 100 acres of land could be bought for $200,000 or $300,000 and where there is no shipping to interfere with the landing of planes and where the city is proposing a development of the new Sunrise .
