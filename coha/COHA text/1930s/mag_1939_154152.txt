Japan having seized most of China 's coastline and the Chinese having been driven far westward , it was in character that some of China 's leaders should turn defeatist and respond to the lure of Japanese offers of position and gold . <P> Fortnight ago former Premier Wang Ching-wei , prominent Nationalist Party leader and member of China 's United Resistance Front , suddenly flew from Chungking , the temporary capital , to Hanoi , capital of French Indo-China .
