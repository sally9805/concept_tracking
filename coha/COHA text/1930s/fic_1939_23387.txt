ATALANTA IN CAPE FAIR A STORY BY JESSIE REHDER N THE front bedroom of the Prokosch I house , where her grandmother 's pine bed stood in the corner , plainer than the chintz chair and gate-legged table her mother had bought recently , Joanna began to dress . With agile fingers the girl jerked the blouse over her head , rumpling the straw-colored hair above her high forehead , not troubling to smooth it down . When she grabbed the bloomers from the bed she handled them as though they were armor , thrusting her long , straight legs through the black serge in one motion . Near the mirror she paused , glancing at her face with puzzled eyes , wishing it were less freckled now that she was sixteen . When Joanna leaned down to tie her shoe she forgot her aversion to her own face and began thinking of the basketball game ahead of her to-night . Already she could smell the acrid odor of sweat that would pervade the gymnasium and hear the raw voices of the crowd lifted to the rafters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the game lagged and her own team was ahead ; but when the contest was a close one she did not even hear them . Then the long hurrahs could sift down from the gallery , the boys on the sidelines could stamp their feet like cattle , but nothing mattered except the way the ball went . The game to-night , the last she would play in Cape Fair before going away to college next year , would be a close one , but Joanna knew her team would win . They always won when her fingers were as cold as they were now and her stomach quivered under her blouse . She wished , however , that the score were already on the blackboard and the game behind her . She wanted people to slap her on the back and tell her how well she had played . She needed the triumphant shouts that went with victory . Then she could see it as a thing accomplished , without the isolated element of doubt that stuck in her throat like a crumb . " Mother , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mended ? It 's time to go . " Her mother came through the door , carrying the sweater at arm 's length , as though it were a fish she had just caught . For a moment she looked at Joanna , her eyes moving over the girl 's proud shoulders . Then , with a sigh , she handed over the garment . " Since to-night is the last game , and everybody in town will be there , I think you ought to take your new sweater . " " I do n't like my new one , " Joanna replied . She stamped her foot against the floor like a pony , staring belligerently at her mother , disturbed by the other 's inability to understand that without this garment the contest to-night , a championship game , would be lost before it began . Passionately she pulled the sweater to her , grabbing it from her mother 's hands . This faded piece of blue wool , with its worn or broken strands , had been her companion in so many successes it had long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish you could come to the game , " the girl said , drawing on her mittens . " You know that I 'd like to come . " " Wo n't you ? " " I have to stay here with Stephen . " The mother glanced over her shoulder at the bedroom behind where her youngest son lay in his iron crib . Then her eyes returned to Joanna . " You can tell me about the game after you come home from the party , " she said . " I suppose I 've got to go to the party . " The girl frowned and sat down on the bed again and stared at the floor , filled with sudden panic . Her face lost the intense , concentrated look it had worn during the day , when the contest ahead , glittering like a light at the end of the corridor , had been her only thought . The dance at the country club , which was to be given after the game for the players , must soon be faced . The contest over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eldest brother along the road through the pines to the squat bungalow where the party was to be held . With an effort Joanna smothered her distrust of a gathering where slick-haired boys and Southern girls with tea-rose faces would be predominant . " Your evening dress is ready , " the mother said . Freddie , the eldest Prokosch boy , came to the door . He stood in the lamplight , his long form bonier and more impressive than Joanna 's now that he had begun to grow up . " You hate parties and I hate basketball games , " he said with his wide grin . " Especially when my sister 's the star . Come along . I 've brought the car round from the garage . It 's time to go . " Joanna kissed her mother good-by and followed Freddie from the house . She trailed the taller form of her brother along the sidewalk to the car , the rubber soles of her shoes sucking against the concrete pavement . With the winter airon her cheeks and the scent of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to think of the game again . She climbed into the seat , her eyes crackling , her mouth a straight line . While the Ford jogged along the dark streets , with winter rushing through the cracks in the windshield , she sat with her hands folded between her knees to keep them warm . Silhouetted against the street lights , her profile had a relentless air of youth about it . She was like an Atalanta , cold , virginal , with no thought except victory . " Get out . " Freddie prodded his sister . " We 're here . " Joanna followed her brother across the brick sidewalk and into the dusty lobby of the high school where the game was to be played . The muscles in her stomach were tighter than before , and as she walked her feet seemed hardly to touch the floor . The objects she noticed every day when she came to school  --  the picture of Washington crossing the Delaware , the statue of Poe 's Raven that was more like an owl , did not exist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gymnasium down the hall , heard nothing but the voices of the players as they shouted to one another while they practiced . " They 've started . " Freddie began to climb the steps that led to the gallery . " You 'd better hurry . " The girl rushed through the door and joined the other players on the court . The ball in her hands , she lost all thought except of the thing she was doing . Under the harsh lights of the gymnasium , with the crowd hanging over the rail above her like clothes from a line , the girl raced through practice with joy in her eyes . She tossed shots from the foul line , caught the ball her team-mates threw her , and boomeranged it back to them , dribbled down the black-marked floor for a trick shot , twirling the ball into the net over her shoulder . In every move Joanna had a finer precision than the other players , but she was too absorbed in the power of her body to be conscious of her own superiority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . team . Sis , boom , bah . Off to the races , hah , hah ! " The clamor pressed against the glass skylight as the practice ended and the players trooped off the field to the dressing room . In this cubicle , which was filled with broken tennis rackets and old sweat shirts , Joanna sat by herself in the corner listening impersonally to the admonitions of Miss Alligood , the bespectacled super visor of athletics . " The championship of the State is at stake , " the teacher began in her high , timorous voice , which sounded frightened even while she was exhorting her charges to smash their opponents off the floor . " The girls on the other team are bigger than we are , so everybody must do her best  --  I want fair play , mind you , but above all things , we must keep the cup in Cape Fair where I am sure " ? she lost the thread of conversation but managed to pick it up again ? " where I am sure it rightfully belongs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pray to-night ? " A young Jewish girl with a serious face and eyes like violets spoke up and retreated in the same breath . " If just this once ? " " Be quiet , Hulda . " Sally Peters , a large forward with tousled hair , interrupted fiercely . " Let 's get it over . " The team came together , including Hulda , who entered the circle hesitantly . The girls put their arms round one an-other 's shoulders and bent their heads toward the floor as though one of them had lost something and they had all decided to look for it together . Joanna waited until the others were assembled then left the bench in the corner and crossed the room toward the group with long strides . " Our Father , " Miss Alligood began , in a tone of not being sure whom she was addressing , " help us to play to-night as we have never played before . " Joanna cleared her throat uncomfortably . She had always felt that the prayer was something to be got over before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she glanced at the Jewish girl , wishing she knew her better . Something about Hulda 's face , the proud arch of the eyebrows , the deep solemnity of the mouth , made Joanna feel almost humble . " In Jesus ' name , amen . " As the prayer ended someone threw open the door to the gymnasium . Bright light fell over the group of players . A chill of excitement went through Joanna . She forgot the prayer , the Jewish girl , and began listening to the voices of the crowd waiting for the game to start . When play began the great force that had been building up inside of her would be unloosed like rushing water . Ever since she could remember , it had always been that way . A whistle sounded and she jerked to attention , eyes bright , legs trembling . " Ready  --  play ! " The white-trousered referee threw the baIl into the air and the opposing centers leaped for it . When it fell in her direction Joanna went down the field , passing the ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feinted , pivoted , backed away from a guard , and finally with a flip of the wrist tossed the ball at the basket where it hovered over the rim and then swished through the net for the first score of the evening . " Pop corn , hot air  --  our team 's Cape Fair . Yea , Prokosch ! " Joanna heard her own name vaguely and the cheers not at all . They were like a satire on a Greek chorus , performed by people who did not belong in the play . As the game progressed they rose spontaneously with every lull in the action , their echoes lingering against the ceiling after the words had died away . Near the end of the half , when the Cape Fair team was in the lead , the cheering crowd in the balcony changed its mood and took on the tense expectancy of people watching an execution and wondering just how terrible the slaughter would be . The students in their striped sweaters clenched their hands over the iron rail that circled the oval bowl in the gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAIR at the court below where the game progressed . The players settled into geometric patterns and then broke into chaos again , but more than one watched Joanna rather than the shifting figures . She played with magnificent abandon , twirling the ball toward the basket from acute angles , running up the field for another , still another , impossibly achieved goal . " Half  --  half ! " The harassed umpire blew the whistle desperately , looking at Joanna as though he were uncertain whether she would obey the signal . The girl came to a perfectly timed stop and walked to the bench . The color was high in her cheeks but under the freckles her skin was as smooth as cream . A faint line of perspiration sat like dew on her upper lip but she did not bother to wipe it off . She sat very still on the hard bench , too aglow with action to be aware of anything except the control she was exercising over her own body . At first she was like a person in a fog , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gymnasium and the people who filled it with a detached interest . At one end of the gallery were a group of girls known as the " Dizzy Dozen , " who were recognized as the social arbiters of the high school . Joanna looked curiously at their modish dresses and the pink finger-nails . When she saw these things she felt a vague curiosity , but as she looked into their faces , so different from her own face , with the bones close to the skin , the tilted nose , the eager mouth , she turned away deliberately . " Oh , Miss Prokoschr The voice from the gallery had a roll like surf against the shore . Joanna looked up and saw Mr. Bellamy , the town alderman , who always came to the game . She wanted to look away again , for she hated his tobacco-stained mouth and hearty manners ; but she knew that she must be polite . Rising from the bench , she walked out on the court and lifted her head toward the gallery , tossing the hair away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody would have suspected how much she disliked the beefy man who leaned down to speak with her , his striped necktie dangling in the air like a stick of peppermint . " Keep up the good work , " he called stentoriously . " Get in there and sock em . Joanna nodded , not bothering to reply . When Bellamy 's head had disappeared she sat down on the bench and began looking at the people in the crowd again . Her eyes went past the mother of Alice Peters , who always brought her knitting to the game , over the acid form of Miss Alligood , and came at last to the violet-eyed Jewish girl who had objected to the prayer . Hulda sat on the bench with the other substitutes , looking at the coach with a faint hope in her eyes that Miss Alligood would decide to let her play in the last half of the game . Joanna watched the Jewish girl for a long time , finding it hard to believe that anyone should want to play and not have the power for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to swim a channel , or smash a tennis ball down the base-Iine , as she had once said to her mother , were as simple as breathing . " I never felt that way , " her mother had replied . " But I know how you feel . I 'm glad you 're interested in games , " she had added , " but at college you 'll find there arc other , more important , things to do . " Joanna wiggled uncomfortably on the hard bench . Could anything be more important than basket-ball , she wondered , knotting the sweat-shirt tighter about her neck . And would she ever do anything as well as she played this game ? Her parents were not sending her away to college to become an athlete . They were sending her so that she could learn solid geometry and more history . She liked history , but geometry  --  Joanna shook her head . It was easier to throw a basket-ball from the exact center of the floor than to square the hypotenuse . Suddenly she wondered whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this game . Jumping to her feet , she walked down the side-lines , trying to recapture her former feeling of security by exercising her legs . She glanced impatiently at the umpire 's table where the referee and the score-keeper were huddled together , going over the record for the first half of the game . Her only desire was for them to finish what they were doing and blow the whistle that would start the action again . To be caught up in the hard contact the contest brought , to lose herself in a sudden rush down the field , to leap high in the air after the ball would be like ascending to heaven . " The half wo n't start for ten minutes , " someone said over her shoulder . " The way you 're going , Joanna , you 'll wear yourself out before it begins . " She turned and saw Jim Brandon , the tall captain of the football team , who had come across the court and was leaning nonchalantly against the wall . " Hello , Jim , " Joanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stared at his fingernails . Joanna stood up so that she could talk with him . The two leaned against the wall , their shoulders close , like figures in a frieze . Jim towered above Joanna but in her own way the girl was as perfect as he . His blunt fingers might have twisted an iron bar , while hers , which were also strong , had a delicacy about them that would make a flower safe . When she moved she was quicker than Brandon too and not so clumsy . " Put on your sweater or you 'll go stiff , " Jim said . The boy touched his own red jacket with the football letters sewed triumphantly across the front of it in a gesture that was almost defiant . " Look , " he might have been saying , " these letters show how much stronger I am than you are . " There was humor in his gesture too but Joanna did not see that . She saw only his superior smile which made her feel more uncertain than she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take at college . " I 'm warm enough , Jim , " she said . " I wo n't get stiff . " " Stay away from the basket during the next half . Keep close to the middle of the floor . " Now Brandon 's voice had the detachment of a master who speaks to a pupil . " The other team 's on to your short shots and will stop them . " " Do you think so ? " Joanna asked . " Sure they are . They 'll bunch their guards under the basket and keep them there . So play wide . Even if you miss it 's better than getting nowhere . " " All right , " Joanna replied . " And say  --  I just saw that brother of yours . He told me you were going to the party with him . I 'll take you instead , Joanna . " As Brandon walked nonchalantly away Joanna pulled her sweater closer over her shoulders staring at him with eyes that were almost frightened . Jim knew the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . And no matter what happened he was never ruffled . That night a week ago when they had driven down the sound road in his new car and he had tried to kiss her , it had been she , rather than he , who was upset . " You 're the most popular boy at the country club to-night . Joanna could almost see him waltzing across the pine floor , dancing with the apple-cheeked girls , having a fine time . While she  --  well , she would be dancing with one , then another of the wet-haired boys with the fuzz still on their cheeks , but she would not feel right about it any more than she felt right about kissing Jim , or wearing the party dress her mother had bought for her , or slipping her toes into the high-heeled shoes that glittered on the floor of the Frokosch closet . Joanna looked down at the heavy rubber-bottoms that encased her feet . She wriggled her toes inside the canvas , feeling the high arch of the bones , wishing she was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wished too , with a sudden desperation , that the dance were over and that she were safe at home in her own bed . She thought with longing of the way Freddie 's shoes sounded when he dropped them on the floor and of the gentle whimpers her youngest brother made when he had dreams he did not like . The party behind her , it would be fun to lie between cool sheets and listen to the wind in the willow tree outside of her window . Then she would be comfortable , not excited as she was when she twirled a basket-ball toward the net , or unlike herself as she felt in evening dress . When she lay in her grandmother 's bed , all that mattered was the sweet , night wind and the tired feeling that began to come over her . It would be good to lie there , with warmth creeping deliciously up from her toes until only the tip of her nose was cold . Finally she would slide into a sleep so profound that not even the noise of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at five in the morning , could awaken her . The referee 's whistle shrilled the news that the half was about to begin , and Joanna jumped to her feet . Stripping off her sweater with a fierce alacrity , she ran out on the court , forgetting everything in a hard excitement . While shepracticed her shots , the gymnasium shrunk around her until it became a world in miniature . In this small universe she was a goddess who could not be overthrown . With every practice shot she became more sure of herself . The harsh , blue lights in the gallery , the singsong voices of the crowd , the new springiness in her legs , made her want to laugh aloud , bringing her a superb physical delight . " Ray  --  ray  --  lack-a-day . Cape Fair ! " The sound of the cheering faded and the second half began . Although Joanna was unconscious of what she was doing , the way she played fell into the most perfect pattern imaginable . Every movement was a blend of instinct with the purest physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her fingers , knowing which way the ball would go , reached for it before the sphere came in her direction . Once she had the ball in her hands and was passing it back and forth she went down the field to the best spot for a goal so fast that she shook her opponents away from her as though they were flies . Everything about the game Joanna had ever known returned to her . The long afternoons in the gymnasium when she had stayed after the others went home and tossed the ball through the shadows until she learned to know where it was going without following it with her eyes , fused into this moment . She was not one girl but all the girls she had been from that first moment four years ago when she walked across the court with her rapid stride , picked up the ball , and threw it at the goal to watch it drop perfectly through the net . As the half progressed , Joanna began to feel vaguely that she was playing in a rhythm of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-players round her , forgot the passage of time , and moved clown the field with a classic grace that brought the spectators to their tip-toes and made the brightly sweatered boys in the gallery break into raucous cheers . The pink-cheeked girls too forgot their restraint and let small noises escape from their red-tipped mouths . But Joanna had stopped thinking of them . She sped down the court below the balcony , oblivious to everything but the delight that coursed through her body . She kept clear of the goal , where the guards hovered with upraised hands , and moved nearer the center circle , shooting the ball from her chest . Afraid to leave the goal free , the guards stood in their positions while Joanna moved before them like a ballet dancer . A few of her shots went wild , rattling off the backboard into waiting hands but more often the ball rolled around the rim and dropped into the net . She kept working back , always closer to the center , until she was in a space by herself , so far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her making a shot successfully . The instant before the whistle that ended the half blew she tossed a long goal from the exact center of the field . The ball arched through the air like a bird , going so high that for a moment it looked as though it would break through the skylight and disappear . Before it began to fall Joanna lost interest in it . With the superb nonchalance that comes only when a person knows he has done a thing perfectly , she turned and walked away without glancing back at the goal . As the ball swished through the net , the final whistle blew . In the gallery people beat one another across the shoulders , on the court the referee hugged the umpire . Everyone went slightly mad except Joanna , who stood near the center circle breathing regularly as though the game were about to begin . " Joanna ! " Freddie wiggled through the crowd to his sister 's side . " You were tops , " he yelled . " Tops ! " The girl turned but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town alderman , cigar still in his mouth , came down from the gallery like a whirlwind . Brushing Freddie aside , he grabbed Joanna 's shoulder . " Grandstand playing ! " Bellamy beat the girl wildly between her shoulder blades . " That last shot beats anything I ever saw . Should be in the New York papers . I know you were thinking of the gallery but that do n't matter . A sensational feat " Joanna stood very quiet , still thinking of the party ahead .
