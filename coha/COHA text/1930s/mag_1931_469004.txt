ON THURSDAY , October 24th , 1929 , the stately mansion of eternal prosperity collapsed with a mighty crash . Thirteen days later , on the 6th of November , there issued from the White House the following extraordinary document : THANKSGIVING -- 1929 By the President of the United States of America A PROCLAMATION At this season of the year , when the harvest has been gathered in , the thoughts of our forefathers turned toward God with thanksgiving for the blessings of plenty and provision against the needs of winter . They came by custom to look to the Chief Magistrate to set apart a day of prayer and praise , whereon their thanks as a united people might be given ? with one voice in unison . God has greatly blessed us as a nation in the year now drawing to a close . The earth has yielded an abundant harvest in most parts of our country . The fruits of industry have been unexampled in quantity and value . Both capital and labor have enjoyed an exceptional prosperity . Assurances of peace at home and abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in provision against preventable disasters from flood and pestilence . Enlightenment has grown apace in new revelations of scientific truth and in diffusion of knowledge . Educational opportunities have steadily enlarged . Enduring advances have been gained in the protection of the public health . Childhood is measurably more secure . New experiences and new knowledge in manyfields have been recorded , from which a deeper wisdom may grow . We should accept these blessings with resolution to devote them to service of Almighty God . Now , therefore , I , Herbert Hoover , President of the United States of America , do appoint and set aside Thursday , the 28th day of November , as a day of national thanksgiving , and do recommend that all our people on that day rest from their daily work , that they should extend to others less fortunately placed a share in their abundance , and that they gather at their accustomed places of worship , there to render up thanks to Almighty God for His many blessings upon them , for His forbearance and goodness . In Witness Whereof , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great seal of the United States . Etc. , etc. , etc . We were a little too close to the stock market uproar to appreciate the sardonic humor in " new experiences and new knowledge in many fields have been recorded from which a deeper wisdom may grow . " We did not realize that many men who rested " on that day from their daily work " would be still resting two years later . We were comfortably assured that sixty days would be the utmost reach of economic difficulty ; things would be looking bright by New Years . Twelve months later Mr. Charles Dana Gibson 's resplendent poster of a militant Liberty with a flaming torch blazoning the legend , " Business Is Good . Keep It So . Nothing Can Stop Us , " was still to be seen on the billboards , but wind and weather had treated the poster harshly , and there were no new ones to take its place . Still from Washington came heartening voices ; in the spring all would be well , the unemployment figures were shrinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home drew near , the President once more called upon his fellow-citizens to give thanks to God for the blessings showered upon them : By the President of the United States of America . A PROCLAMATION Notwithstanding that our forefathers endured the hardships and privations of primitive life , surrounded by dangers and solaced only with meager comforts , they nevertheless bequeathed to us a custom of devoting one day of every year to universal thanksgiving to Almighty God for the blessing of life itself and the means to sustain it , for the sanctuary of home and the joys that pervade it , and for the mercies of His protection from accident , sickness and death . Our country has many causes for Thanksgiving . We have been blessed with distinctive evidence of Divine favor . As a nation , we have suffered far less than other peoples from the present world difficulties . We have been free from civil and industrial discord . The outlook for peace between nations has been strengthened . In a large view we have made progress upon the enduring structure of our institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our control of nature have been notably advanced . Education has been further extended . We have made gains in the prevention of disease and the protection of childhood . Now , therefore , I , Herbert Hoover , President of the United States of America , do hereby designate Thursday , November n , 1930 , as a national day of thanksgiving , and do enjoin the people of the United States so to observe it , calling upon them to remember that many of our people are in need and suffering from causes beyond their control , and suggesting that a proper celebration of the day should include that wemake sure that every person in the community , young and old , shall have cause to give thanks for our institutions and for the neighborly sentiment of our people . In Witness Whereof , etc. , etc . What a melancholy must have been his when the Chief Magistrate signed that second proclamation ! Perhaps his thoughts went back to his speech accepting the nomination to office : " We in America to-day are nearer to the final triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . . . We have not yet reached the goal , but , given a chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years , we shall soon , with the help of God , be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation . There is no guaranty against poverty equal to a job for every man . " A job for every man ! Where now was the man whose name had blessed " the policies of the last eight years " ? In peaceful retirement , undisturbed by the storm of fear and panic , he was busily occupied . day after day , turning out words of wisdom at two dollars a word . The truth had to be admitted : when Mr. Coolidge left office he had taken his prosperity with him . All that could be done now was to take the large view that " we have made progress upon the enduring structure of our institutions . " Almost a year has gone by since then , and within the next few days it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third proclamation of thanksgiving . He is doubtless meditating upon it now . Would it be amiss if we drew his attention to a number of things for which his countrymen arc truly thankful ? Doubtless while he ponders he realizes that to draft a proclamation of thanksgiving in this year of grace is a rather arduous task . Perhaps he is thinking to himself , " Advancement in the arts and sciences , yes . The protection of children and the sanctity of the home , yes . But what more ? " In his travail of spirit let us extend a helping hand . Mr. Hoover , there are a number of reasons why your fellow-countrymen are ready to give thanks . The strange exhilaration of the boom time seems far away now . The captains and the kings of industry have ceased from talking and , in well-deserved retirement , are paying strict attention to their own business . No longer are distinguished fliers and channel swimmers received with screaming sirens , clouds of ticker tape , and crowded stands at City Hall . The Big Builder has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter never a word . We ask for bread in all truth , but our appetite for circuses is a little dull . Bandmasters and police commissioners in evening dress fade from the horizon , and in their wake go trooping a procession of stupid wastes and idiotic extravagances of mind and body . And for these blessings , unrecognized at first , we are a grateful people . IT What complicated little souls children came to be during the dollar decade ! We began to realize the criminal ignorance of our forbears where children were concerned . The exposure of the infant in ancient times was scarcely less hideous than the callous way in which our grandparents had left children to their own devices on Saturday afternoon . We discovered that children were not children at all , not offspring , not future citizens , but personalities , delicate , fragile , in constant danger of being warped into frightful distortions . A parent distressed to find that a child of twelve had difficulty in spelling words of one syllable was told that his daughter 's aptitude test had clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insistence on study might prove dangerous . The affectionate father who listened with ill-concealed glee to his small son 's account of a school battle was little short of a monster . Mothers found that , all unknowing , they had fostered the hideous calipus complex in their children . In the face of these perils we did our best , sitting at the feet of the masters , striving to learn the secret of infant understanding . School after school arose , each with a law and gospel of its own , but all with the same aim ? the development of a sound and beautiful mind in a sound and beautiful body . Hey for the personality gland and medico-recreational supervision ! Sometimes we were confused by the uproar when two schools of juvenile psychology collided , but in the main we were steadfast disciples . There were schools that fostered a child 's sense of self-expression ; there were schools where the word " work " was never suffered to be said aloud lest it disconcert a budding personality ; there were schools that exposed the folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perfect freedom . We were n't greatly concerned when the Supreme Court once again declared the Child Labor Law unconstitutional ; we were too busy to be disturbed when an American judge sentenced a boy of sixteen to a minimum term of twenty years in the penitentiary . How could we be , engrossed as we were in behaviorism and progressive education ? We sought and were sure we could find a way to bring our offspring to majority clean-limbed , sweetminded , and without a bruise . But now , unable to afford the cost of these benefits , by an inexorable pressure we are turned toward the public schools . We have long heard of their shortcomings , of overcrowding , of teachers overworked and underpaid . Minds toughened in the past two years begin to wonder if we should not give a little more time and attention to these schools if our children must attend them . Is there a growing conviction here and there that reading , writing and arithmetic have an importance that even eurythmics can not cancel ? We feel a little foolish now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discipline themselves these days begin to wonder if the word is quite so loathsome as once they thought . Faintly we remember an old saw : " Every tub must sit on its own bottom " ; and slowly , sadly , we come to admit that work and play , love and obedience are not incompatible , and that no gentle , easy way to maturity will ever be found for our children . They , like ourselves , must learn from experience . And if so much has been gained , we can be thankful . For a time , in the golden glow of the boom , the misfit came into his own . The lazy , the indolent , the idle fed through good times , fattened further upon inhibitions . Introvert , extrovert , or invert , each became in his way a hero , the lion of the drawing-rooms . A rude , blatant , insufferable person could plead mental torment and be sympathetically excused . Even when be had departed his charm remained , for we discussed his case in all its rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decency , or good humor ; therefore , we cherished him . We whispered first and then grew bolder about captives . Pallid ladies and gentlemen were suddenly discovered in Peoria , Davenport , and Wichita , and were regarded with a certain awe . Tolerance was popular . We discussed Freud and Jung . Those of us who were safely normal had noreason to believe ourselves devoid of interest . We devoured volumes that made clear and plain the reasons for our behavior , and those of us who could not spare time for the volumes had the same food served up in spoonfuls in the evening papers . There was a psychological reason for everything we did . It was fascinating to learn why we were annoyed when a street car passenger trod upon our feet ; we discovered that the very brushing of our teeth had an extraordinary significance . And oh the golden harvest the psychiatrists reaped ! How many thousand indulged and discontented women spun out their trivial woes in year-long analyses . Can we not remember conversations rendered well nigh unintelligible with such phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " masochism " ? But extravagant fees for personality guidance are impossible now . The woes of the indolent lose their charm when we confront an army that desperately wants to work but can not . Many a complex has been flattened to a pancake in the past two years by the pressure of necessity . We have learned that explaining and diagramming our ill temper , our selfishness , and our fatuous habits will avail us nothing . There is a pleasant novelty in that almost-forgotten word , fortitude . Now when we gather with our neighbors for fireside conversation ? if with luck we have a fireside ? there is scarce a man or woman among us who dares to say " neurosis . " And for this blessing we are thankful . Shall we forget the days when marriage became a new and splendid thing , when the freedom of the sexes scored its triumph ? The companionate marriage was in its first bloom , and frankness came into its own . There were so many first-class reasons and excuses in those days . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we understood what she meant . No longer need a husband announce a sudden business trip . If he were not quite sure of himself , he could plead marital maladjustment ; the more confident ones airily resigned their wives to other lovers and went off gaily to more exciting weekends . The merry-go-round and the brass ring ! Adultery quit the back streets and shady hotels and became a fine art . With the young , so jealous of their freedom , a discussion of marriage came to resemble an arms conference . Each side reserved to itself so many rights and privileges that little remained to be shared between them . Yet the risk was taken because if , despite all this barbed wire , happiness was still impossible , divorce was easy . The hubbub of Paris , Reno , and Yucatan filled the papers . IT the plenitude of money was the last hope of marriage , it likewise made alimony a very simple matter . But some of those boom-time husbands now languish in jail because alimony has ceased to be simple , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the decree was granted . The sudden and precipitate drop in the number of divorces in 1930 seems to suggest that our young husbands and wives are slower to anger and more plenteous in mercy than once they were . There is less time , less money now for maladjustment ; and the meetings of the family ways and means committee show an understanding not entirely concerned with money . Perhaps the spectacle of families blown to pieces in the economic hurricane has taught the more fortunate among us the virtues of forbearance . If it is true , let us be thankful . IV One responsibility that could not be refused in those days was the necessity of keeping up with the Joneses . High and low , we all did our best . We 're not forgetting . now anyway , that therewere unemployed and hungry people through all the bonanza years , but those of us who had money or could put our hands upon it spent it where it showed most . Schools and colleges vied with one another in florid dormitories and imposing stadiums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . At home our minds were absorbed in splendid gear . Our apparel was costly and so was our entertainment . From the need for a new automobile every year , we came to demand two and three . If the Joneses bought a sports roadster for young Sam , our Roger was bitterly aggrieved until he had his . There was so much of everything to be had , and we had so much of everything . Did we see anything wrong in the statement of a fashion expert that no woman could dress herself decently ou less than fifteen hundred dollars a year , even if no allowance were made for such necessities as furs and costume jewelry ? When our dwellings began to seem shabby , how grateful we were to the interior architects , decorators , and antique dealers who so blithely showed us the error of our ways . Their cousins the stylists , cousins surely by a left-handed marriage , carried applied art and psychology to its farthest reach . Can it be true that we seriously believed that kitchen ware in Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department stores had stylists to tell us about it , and their delivery carts left the skillets with us next day . We not only kept up with the Joneses at home but we did it in business . Long years gone by we had laughed at Mr. Woolworth 's Napoleonic mania and thought his First Empire office with its busts and velvet and ormolu and marble something of a joke . The joke was forgotten after a while , and at the high tide of big money we regarded with great respect the lawyer who boasted an Adam reception room and a sanctum done in carved woods . We lived in swank , we worked in swank . No matter how little or how much we earned , there was swank to match . If a William and Mary hallway was too expensive , we could buy a super-heterodyne in a lacquered Japanese cabinet for a dollar down and a dollar forever . If we could not aspire to Lake Forest , there was something very nice a little farther down the scale . Park Avenue might be beyond us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrace Apartments where the doormen every day reproduced with grave fidelity the change of the guard at Buckingham Palace . It was all High Class . The Joneses were high class , and we were high class too , and withal , most damnably dull . Conversation was smothered in market , plush , and radio . A good deal of the high-class travertine has since turned out to be plaster , and we are a little soured to discover that the carved wood ceilings are only papier-mache . But it is n't all sour grapes by any manner of means . It is true that we no longer adorn our small talk with details of our bridge winnings and losses ; we must admit that our bank accounts do not allow us period rooms and costly glass . We see more baked potato and less caviar on those refectory tables . It is n't sport to be poor , but is it altogether making a virtue of necessity to learn that one can be happy without illusions bought on the installment plan ? The Boxy Theater and its replicas throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America has ever known . Our high tone , like our marble , was spurious . We know it now , and our humble pie sits well . V What a prodigious number of big men came to the fore in those days . Big men in industry , in finance , in advertising , in linoleum , big men in everything . And almost all of them were talkative . They gave interviews , quoted one another , addressed dinners , and wrote books . How we worshipped the prophets of the new economic era who so infallibly piloted Radio Common to 549 and Montgomery Ward to 439A . On Sundays Doctor Cadman talked about business in religion , and on weekdays Mr. Barton talked about religion in business . We were good and we were prosperous , we had our cake and ate it too . Once upon a time we had felt very doubtful about people who bought things on the installment plan , regarding it as a vicious , shiftless habit indulged in by the lower classes who lived beyond their means . Our condescension vanished when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly so , for big men assured us that the installment plan was basically sound . Directly behind the big men were the experts . They covered the earth , they expertised " everything . Every field of effort was split up into little plots and each plot given over to a forecaster , a counsellor , or a consultant . In business every detail , no matter how trivial , required the attention of an expert . It was as if men and women had entirely lost faith in their own judgment and common sense , as if the more confidence they had in prosperity , the less they had in themselves . The giants of mass production had put a radio in every home , and nightly we listened to Assistant Secretaries of Commerce , to presidents of corporations and the heads of Bar Associations , who made us understand that at last prosperity and permanence were one and the same thing . New and imposing bank facades in limestone and granite arose all over the country , with the device of the eagle , wings spread and talons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bronze doors are shut to-day , with the eagle , hard-eyed and defiant , guarding an empty vault . We are not so positive as we were about our farsighted judgment , or that of every banker . Like Enoch , once they walked with God , and still like Enoch , many of them now are not . We have seen rural banks swept out of existence , we have seen the Caldwell collapse rock the South from end to end , we have seen what alleyway huckstering can do to the Bank of United States . We have learned , by paying for our knowledge with worthless stocks and depreciated bonds , that a millennium of luxury and big money is not yet in sight . We 're still solvent , but we 're not stampeding at the trough these days . We 're in it , and we 're bending our energies toward getting out , and our efforts are notably assisted by an absence of Big Men . We are paying strict attention to plans just now , and the plan we 're investigating is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are humbly thankful . VI These are all superficial reasons for gratitude , perhaps . On the surface of daily life we have discovered many things to be liabilities which in the prosperous days were cultural necessities . Is there a smell of middle-class satisfaction in this attitude ? If we find ourselves relieved to give up the folly of competitive spending , of show and noise , if we are happier in the belief that adversity can strengthen home ties , we are indeed to congratulate ourselves . But that is not all . If it were , the price the nation has paid would be far too dear . No civilized person can survey a horde of broken men , beaten women , and antemic children and say , " It was worth it all if we have learned that one party an evening is more fun than three . " Itis when we go deeper , when we go below the amenities of everyday living , that we find real reason for gratitude . When distress strikes us unaware , instinctively we always turn to someone for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If money gives out , we look to someone in the family . A wave of infantile paralysis endangers the city , and we call upon the Mayor and Health Commissioner to do something about it . A drought sweeps the state , burning the crops , and we expect the Governor and the Legislature to come to our assistance . There is a season of prolonged rains , the Mississippi floods its banks , spreading death and destruction , and we feel sure that the President and Congress will act . When an international crisis arises we turn to the Kellogg Pact , the World Court or the League . Beyond that , when all else fails , a distracted humanity can only fall upon their knees and invoke the deity : " Help , Lord , or we perish , " The sour and the cynical are tempted , at such a spectacle , to recall Elijah taunting the priests of Baal : " Cry aloud , for he is a god . Either he is talking or he is pursuing , or he is in a journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their attitude acknowledges the blundering of human kind and admits that no man or group of men can change things . They speak the truth and happily the truth sets them free from doing anything about it . They with the kneelers and invokers are in the same galley ; they have forgotten themselves . With our own eyes we have now seen a catastrophe shake the world . We have seen showy fronts collapse , revealing rotten foundations . We have seen trust betrayed , we have seen the pitiful flownlerings and deceptions of those set in authority over us . We have seen Cabinet members jailed for bribery , we have seen a presidential candidate defamed because he was a Catholic , while a Protestant bishop campaigning against him was buying and selling through a bucket-shop . We have seen crippled factories , labor wars , mines shut down ; we have seen harvests destroyed in Texas while people starved in Arkansas ; we have seen avalanches of cotton , wheat , and oil poured out , while thousands of us were hungry , cold , and unclad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas wheat farmer , the textile worker , the oil driller , and the miner can arouse in us not only sympathy for him but alarm for ourselves . We begin to understand ? it comes slowly perhaps , but the understanding is coming ? that a man who can not work , who can not feed and clothe his family , is a threat , not to our present happiness or our felicity in a future life , but to our existence here and now . We begin to understand that a mad rush for markets , a feverish overproduction of goods , and a sky-reaching system of tariff barriers are the forerunners of ruin . We have discovered that a ruthless drive for profit will only defeat itself . It is a question of survival , not altruism , and it comes home to us that we have no one to depend upon save ourselves . No President , no Congress , no omnipotent deity ; in the last ditch we can count only on ourselves , you and I , just ourselves . None of us can know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must carry the mail while others police the streets , run the dynamos , drive the machines , write the books , and paint the pictures . No single man can change the world , no soap-box authority can ever reform a system , but we come slowly to see that the kernel of that battered word co-operation may mean that he who ruleth his spirit is greater than he who taketh a city . If we have begun to learn that our selfishness is inextricably bound up with the selfishness of our neighbors and that the realization of our security depends in a vital and economic sense upon the security of others , we shall have begun to put co-operation into practice . The world depends on those who work ; for that work we are personally responsible . No one , high or low , can escape it . And personal responsibility , the responsibility for our thought and action , can not be delegated to anybody . The instant we realize this , in that instant our strength begins to return . It is here that our much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be orders to be obeyed as long as mankind lives on earth , there will be crises unforeseen that we shall have to cope with as best we can , there will be the eternal death and taxes ; but that is no cause whatever for despair . Thank God , we have ourselves to depend upon . If this conviction has begun to crystallize , we can be thankful as we never have been before . VII With this arrival of understanding comes a sharpening of our critical powers . It becomes harder and harder for the smooth , the glib , and the pat to carry conviction . We are tired to death , Mr. Hoover , of fatuous utterance and feeble prevarication in high places . We are tired of officials who issue ridiculous statements on unempioyment when we know better . We are tired of presidents of chambers of commerce who talk as if the danger of starvation for millions of men and women were a trifle , compared with the danger that a government which protects employers with a tariff may appropriate funds for ex-employees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health was never so high as it is now , when we know perfectly well that such is not the case . We are tired of the protests of Mr. Hamilton Fish 's committee over the dumping of Soviet convict-made products in this country when it is estimated that nearly one hundred million dollars ' worth of goods made by American convicts is thrown on the market each year to compete with the products of free labor . We 're tired of splendid speeches about America 's efforts for disarmament when we are able to see for ourselves in the annual budget that the proposed expenditures for our army and navy rise far above all the others , exceeded only by the appropriation for the Veterans ' Bureau . We want the truth , Mr. Hoover . We do n't believe in big rich any more . Let there he no misunderstanding . The realization that in the last ditch we can depend only upon ourselves is not an admission of defeat , but rather the reverse . It brings with it a sense of freedom , an exhilaration that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can rejoice with a high heart at our good fortune . But the nation has paid a most fearful price ; our salvation has been bought with blood . Therefore , Mr. Hoover , when in the coming days you once again issuethe call to your fellow-citizens to assemble for a festival of prayer and praise , bethink you of the opportunity that lies ready to your hand . You are the Chief Executive ; you , like us , can depend upon no one but yourself in the last ditch . But is it too much to expect that when we look once more for that splendid legend : By the President of the United States of America we shall find under it a reflection of the feeling in the hearts of your countrymen , a feeling of humility and sober determination ? Such a message , in such a time as this , will deserve to stand with that of one of your predecessors , an honorable gentleman , in whose memorial beside the Potomac , not far from where you now reside , you may read these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here dedicated to the great task remaining before us .. . that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain , that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom , and that government of the people , by the people , for the people shall not perish from the earth .
