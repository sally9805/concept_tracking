Keigher then started to remedy the trouble , a frozen carburetor . Suddenly he looked up to find himself surrounded by a dozen ' hostile looking men , each carrying a rifle . " What 's the idea ? " one of them asked . " Motor trouble , " explained Keigher , eyeing the guns . " Well , you ca n't land here , " returned the first speaker . " It 's against the rules . " Keigher quickly finished his repair Job , took off , and soon afterward landed in Ottawa .
