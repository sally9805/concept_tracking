( See front cover ) In Castel Gandolfo last month His Holiness Pope Pius XI , much refreshed by a summer in the cool Alban Hills , summoned to his side for an hour 's conference His Eminence Eugenic Cardinal Pacelli , Secretary of State to His Holiness , Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church , Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica . What the 79-year-old Holy Father said to the austere , slim-fingered 60-year-old Prince of the Church who is his most trusted associate , no outsider knew . Next day , amid villagers ' cheers and band music , the Pope returned from Castel Gandolfo to Vatican City ten days ahead of schedule . <P> And the day after that Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli quietly entrained for Naples , boarded the Conte di Savoia , tacitly acknowledged that he was bound for the U. S. <P> Although in years past Cardinal Pacelli has spent a quiet month 's vacation in Switzerland or at Montecatini , Vatican officials blandly informed newshawks that his decision to cross the Atlantic at one of its stormiest seasons was " inspired by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it be known that the Cardinal Secretary of State was traveling incognito , accompanied only by his gentleman-in-waiting , Count Enrico Galeazzo , Vatican City engineer and representative of the Knights of Columbus in Rome ; that the Cardinal wished no elaborate welcome in Manhattan ; that his headquarters during his stay would be the great and peaceful Long Island estate of a great Catholic lady , Mrs. Nicholas Frederic Brady , devout and gracious widow of the Manhattan utilities tycoon who left her $9,700,000 at his death six years ago . <P> To the U. S. Press these explanations of the advent of the most potent Catholic prelate ever to take ship for New York were decidedly inadequate . Only a visit from His Holiness himself could be of greater import to U. S. Catholics . To make sense of Cardinal Pacelli 's trip , secular gossips worked overtime , evolved several theories : The Cardinal , perhaps , was being dispatched to Washington to negotiate a resumption of diplomatic relations between the U. S. and the Vatican , breached in 1867 when Congress , foreseeing the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain a minister at the Vatican . Or , he intended to invite the collaboration of the U. S. Government in the Church 's battle to the death against Communism . Again , he was going to do something about Mother Church 's No. 1 demagog , Radiorator Charles Edward Coughlin . The- loudest Catholic voice in the land had continued to belabor the U. S. President in spite of the quietus which Vatican Voices supposedly had attempted to clap on him through his easy-going superior , Detroit 's Bishop Gallagher , at Rome last summer ( TIME , Aug. 17 et seq. ) .
