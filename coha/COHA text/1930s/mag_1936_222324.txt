To Congress last week went the first of a series of reports from the Securities &; Exchange Commission on reorganization and protective committees . This fertile field for Roosevelt reform is still unfinished business so far as New Deal securities legislation is concerned . A 133-page document , crammed with facts , figures and juicy dialog gleaned from SEC 's hearings last year , the report dealt only with municipal securities . Other reports on railroad , real estate , industrial and foreign protective committees will soon follow , accompanied by recommendations for regulatory legislation . <P> Specific recommendations will not be made until other reports are in . But the trend of SEC thought , guided by brilliant young Commissioner William Orville Douglas who has handled the protective committee study , was summed up sharply in its observations in the municipal field . Urging extension of the Municipal Bankruptcy Act , which was done last week a few days after the report appeared , the Commission concluded : <P> " We submit that regulation of the personnel and practices of protective committees in connection with municipal debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the many instances cited of committees whose members have interests adverse to those of the investors whom they purport to represent ; of committees whose mode of organization and subsequent activities are calculated to discourage the investigation and prosecution of possible causes of action in favor of bondholders or of the debtor ; of committees which have profited extensively from their trust by voting themselves payments for expenses , compensation and otherwise ; of committees which have distributed patronage to attorneys , depositaries , secretaries , agents and others with a liberal hand ; and of committees which , if not actually injuring investors , have found it possible , thanks to the usual ironclad deposit agreement , to do nothing for bondholders while milking their securities .
