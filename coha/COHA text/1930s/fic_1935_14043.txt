Dead End of a New York street , ending in a wharf over the East River . To the left is a high terrace and a white iron gate leading to the back of the exclusive East River Terrace Apartments . Hugging the terrace and filing up the street are a series of squalid tenement houses . Beyond the wharf is the East River , covered by a swirling scum an inch thick . A brown river , mucky with floating refuse and offal . A hundred sewers vomit their guts into it . Uptown of the wharf as we float down Hell Gate , the River voices its defiant protest in fierce whirlpools and stumbling rapids , groaning . Further down , we pass under the arch of the Queensboro Bridge , spired , delicate , weblike in superstructure , powerful and brutal in the stone and steel which it plants like uncouth giant feet on the earth . In its hop , skip , and jump over the River it has planted one such foot on the Island called Welfare , once the home of hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an eyesore to the fastidious who have recently become its neighbors . And here on the shore , along the Fifties , is a strange sight . Set plumb down in the midst of slums , antique warehouses , discarded breweries , slaughterhouses , electrical works , gas tanks , loading cranes , and coal-chutes , the very wealthy have begun to establish their city residence in huge , new , palatial apartments . The East River Terrace is one of these . Looking up this street from the vantage of the River , we see only a small portion of the back terrace and a gate ; but they are enough to suggest the towering magnificence of the whole structure . The wall is of rich , heavy masonry , guarded at the top by a row of pikes . Beyond the pikes , shutting off the view of the squalid street below , is a thick edging of lush green shrubbery . And beyond that , a glimpse of the tops of gaily colored sun umbrellas . Occasionally , the clink of glasses and laughter filter through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ornamented with an elaborate , ivy-covered trellis to hide its ugliness . The gateposts are crowned with brass ship lanterns , one red , one green . Through the gateway is a catwalk which leads to a floating dock , where the inhabitants of this apartment moor their boats and yachts . Contrasting sharply with all this richness is the mis-eased street below , filthy , strewn with torn newspapers and garbage from the tenements . The tenement houses are close , dark , and crumbling . They crowd each other . Where there are curtains in the windows , they are streaked and faded ; where there are none , we see through to hideous , water-stained , peeling wallpaper , and old , broken-down furniture . The fire escapes are cluttered with gutted mattresses and quilts , old clothes , breadboxes , milk bottles , a canary cage , an occasional potted plant struggling for life . To the right is a huge , red sand hopper , standing on stilts of heavy timber several stories tall . Up the street , blocking the view , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west , are the sky-scraping parallelepipeds of Radio City . An alleyway between two tenements tied together by drooping lines of wash gives us a distant glimpse of the mighty Empire State Building , rearing its useless mooring tower a quarter of a mile into the clouds . At the juncture of tenement house and terrace is a police callbox ; at the juncture of the street and wharf is a police stanchion bearing the warning " Dead End . " The boards of the wharf are weather-beaten and deeply grained ; the piles are stained green with algae to where the water licks , and brown above . A ladder nailed to the beams dips down into the river . The sunlight tossed from the waves dances across the piles to the musical lap of the water . Other river sounds counterpoint the orchestration : the bells and the whistles , the clink and the chug of passing boats . A gang of boys are swimming in the sewerage at the foot of the wharf , splashing about and enjoying it immensely . Some of them wear torn bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythmic , shocking jargon that would put a truck driver to blush . There are a few onlookers . A fat , greasy woman leans out a tenement window . She is peeling an orange and throwing the peels into the street . A sensitive-faced young man , in a patched , frayed shirt , open at the neck , is sitting on one of the piles . In his lap is a drawing board . Occasionally he will work feverishly , using pencil and triangular ruler , then he will let the pencil droop , and stare out over the river with deep-set eyes , dream-laden , moody . A tubercular-looking boy about sixteen is up near the hopper , pitching pennies to the sidewalk . There is a splash of water , a loud derisive laugh , and up the ladder climbs a boy , lean , lithe , long-limbed , snub-nosed , his cheeks puffed with water . Reaching the top of the ladder , he leans over and squirts out the water . A yelp below . He laughs again and cries : " Gotcha dat time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wharf . One , a tiny Italian with a great shock of blue-black hair , is dangling a shoe box almost as big as himself ; the other , a gawky Polack , head shaven , cretinous , adenoidal , is slapping his thigh with a rolled newspaper as he runs . They shout : " Hi ya , Tommy ? " TOMMY MCGRATH H'lo Angel ! H'lo Dippy ! ANGEL unslings his box , and starts tearing off his clothes . A squat boy with a brutish face , snot bubbling from his nostrils , climbs up after TOMMY . As he reaches the top and sees the others , he shouts in a mocking singsong , " Dopey Dippy , dopey Dippy , dopey Dippy ! " p. 3 DIPPY Shat ap , will ya , Spit ! SPIT spitting through his teeth at DIPPY , who is stripping his jersey over his head:Right inna belly-button ! Laughs and climbs onto the wharf to sprawl next to TOMMY . DIPPY mumbles and wipes out his navel with his finger . TOMMY MCGRATH Lay off ' im , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! TOMMY MCGRATH Wassamattuh ? Yuh a wise guy er a boy scout ? C'm on in , Dippy ! ANGEL Howza wawda , Tommy ? TOMMY MCGRATH Boy ! Duh nuts ! SPIT Geeze , great ! ANGEL Cold ? TOMMY MCGRATH Nah . Swell . Jus ' right . Wiping off some of the river filth that has clung to him.Boy , deah 's a lot a junk inna wawda tuhday ! DIPPY pointing to some dirt on SPIT'sback : Wat 's ' at ? He touches SPIT , smells his finger and makes a wry face.Pee  --  ew , whadda stink ! SPIT plucks off a huge gob of filth and throws it at DIPPY . DIPPY whines.What yuh wan na do dat fuh ? p. 4 SPIT Aw , I 'll mobilize yuh ! TOMMY MCGRATH Leave ' im alone ! To DIPPY.Why n't yuh keep yuh trap shut , huh ? DIPPY He trew dat crap on me ! I wuz TOMMY MCGRATH O.K. O.K. O.K. Pointing at some imaginary object near the sand hopper.Hey , felluhs , look ! All look off . TOMMY sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! SPIT turns his head and bumps his nose on TOMMY 's finger . The boys laugh.Nex ' time leave ' im alone , see ? The cadaverous-looking lad picks up his pennies , and comes down to the others , boasting , " Boy , I git a crack all a time ! " TOMMY MCGRATH rising:Yeah ? Aw right , T.B. , I 'll pitch yuh . T. B. O.K. C'm on . TOMMY MCGRATH Lemme a couple . T. B. Yuh ai n't got ' ny ? TOMMY MCGRATH Come on ! I 'll pay yuh back . TOMMY and T.B . go up to the hopper and pitch pennies to the sidewalk . SPIT turning to DIPPY , makes a swipe at him . DIPPY backs away : Two fuh flinchin ' two fuh flinchin ' ! p. 5 DIPPY I di ' not . SPIT Yuh did so . DIPPY I di ' not . ANGEL Why n't cha choose ?

He bangs DIPPY twice on the head . DIPPY Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ah , yuh louse . Yuh did n't have tuh hit me so hahd . Wid ' all his might he hit me . Wid ' all his might , duh son uva bitch ! TOMMY MCGRATH still absorbed in pitching pennies with T.B.:Why n't yuh pick on a kid who kin fight back ? p. 6 SPIT Aw-w-w ! TOMMY MCGRATH Ah ! The DOORMAN , a giant in powder-blue uniform with gilt buttons and braid , opens the gate of the apartment house , crosses to the end of the side-walk and blows a whistle , then signals to someone up the street to come down . He turns to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gateway of the East River Terrace . DOORMAN I 'm so sorry , ma'am , but it 'll only be for a day or two . OLD LADY That 's quite all right . OLD GENTLEMAN arthritic , grumpy , walking slowly and with effort:It is n't at all . There 's no reason why we should have to walk half a block to the car . A colored man in chauffeur 's uniform comes down the sidewalk . DOORMAN I 'm so sorry , sir . OLD LADY That 's quite all right . She pauses a moment , surveying the boys . Look at this ! OLD GENTLEMAN Humph ! I 've seen it from the balcony . ANGEL Hey , look , guys ! Dey usin ' a back daw . TOMMY MCGRATH I wonduh why . DIPPY familiarly , to the young man who is sketching:Duh yuh know , Gimpty ? Hey , Gimpty ? p. 7 GIMPTY What ? DIPPY Duh yuh know why ? GIMPTY Why what ? DIPPY Why dey usin ' a back daw . GIMPTY Are they ? DIPPY Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAUFFEUR salutes the OLD MAN and offers him an arm to lean on . CHARLES Good afternoon , sir , I 'm sorry I could n't drive the car around the OLD LADY That 's all right , Jordan . Look at these youngsters ! Are n't they sweet ? OLD GENTLEMAN Sweet ? Yes from a distance ! They walk up the street , out of sight . A passing tug blasts the air with its foghorn . TOMMY , having won at penny-pitching , puts the pennies in the pocket of his trousers , which are hanging on the hopper . T.B. , disconsolate , goes to ANGEL . T. B. Dat cleans me . I du n no . I kin always git a crack when I 'm playin ' by myself . He watches ANGEL , who is fussing with a scrap of newspaper and some strange , brown substance.Watcha got deah ? ANGEL It 's a dried up hawse-ball. p. 8 T. B. Watcha doin ' ? ANGEL I 'm gon na make some cigarettes . Some guy tole me  --  yuh kin make cigarettes outa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm gon na try it . T. B.

DIPPY He 's makin ' cigarettes outa hawse-balls . GIMPTY Out of what ? p. 9 ANGEL Hawse-balls . GIMPTY Throw it away , you crazy fool . You want to get sick ? ANGEL I kin smoke . Whadda yuh t'ink I yam ? GIMPTY Listen . I read about a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . ANGEL What ? GIMPTY Great big things grew right out of his head . ANGEL turning away from GIMPTY , with disgust:Aw-w-w , go wan . GIMPTY Listen if I give you a good one , will you throw that away ? ANGEL turning back eagerly:Sure ! GIMPTY appropriates ANGEL 's horrible cigarette and throws it into the water ; then takes a sack of tobacco from his pocket , adeptly rolls a cigarette and holds it out to ANGEL:Here ! Stick out your tongue . ANGEL licks the paper . GIMPTY completes rolling the cigarette and gives it to him.There you are ! Now do n't try that again . You 'll get sick as a dog . Remember I 'm tellin ' you . ANGEL proudly exhibiting his cigarette:Boy ! Hey , felluhs , look ! Gimpty gim me a butt . To T.B.Gimme a light , T.B . T.B . fishes some matches from his pocket and lights ANGEL 's cigarette . p. 10 DIPPY dashing over to GIMPTY:Me too , Gimpty ! Gim me ! Yew know me ! Yew know me ! DIPPY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him like a horde of locusts . They hold out their hands and beg plaintively . " Give us one ! Yew know us , Gimpty . " GIMPTY No ! No ! No more ! Beat it ! That 's all ! They only plead the louder.I said that 's all . Do n't you understand English ? You want a boot in the behind ? Two men come down the street . One , tall , young , rather good-looking in a vicious way ; the other , older , shorter , squat , a sledgehammer build . The first has thin nervous lips , narrow agate eyes , bloodshot . A peculiarly glossy face , as if the skin had been stretched taut over the cheekbones , which are several sizes too large for the lean jaw underneath . Here is a man given to sudden volcanic violences that come and are gone in a breath . His movements are sharp , jerky ; his reflexes exaggerated , those of a high-strung man whose nerves are beginning to snap under some constant strain . He covers it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning forward , hips thrown back , almost as if out of joint . He wears a gray , turned-down fedora , an expensive suit , sharpy style , the coat a bit too tight at the waist , pleated trousers , and gray suede shoes . His squat companion is dressed almost identically , but was not designed to wear such clothes . His trousers hang on his hips , revealing a bulge of shirtwaist between vest and trouser-top , his barrel of a chest is too thick for his jacket , his arms too long for the sleeves . His huge fingers you notice at once ! Thick stubs sticking out of the shapeless bags of his hands like the teats of a cow . The two men come down almost to the edge of the wharf . The tall one lights a cigarette , looks about , smiles , shakes his head , and talks sotto voce to his companion . p. 11 TOMMY MCGRATH to GIMPTY : Aw , ta hell wid ' yuh ! Cheap skate ! The boys walk away , disgusted . GIMPTY rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawingboard . SPIT Yeah , ta hell wid ' im ! DIPPY Yeah , ta hell wid ' im ! SPIT crosses to his clothes , which are hanging from a nail on the hopper:I dun need hisn . I got ta stack a butts I picked up I 'm savin ' . TOMMY MCGRATH Give us one . DIPPY Yeah ! Give us one ! SPIT Nah . I 'm savin ' ' em . TOMMY MCGRATH Don ' be a miser . SPIT takes out a tobacco tin , opens it , exposing a rare collection of cigarette ends gleaned from the streets . Grudgingly he hands TOMMY and DIPPY a butt each , then selects a choice one for himself.Gimme a light , T.B . They all light up and puff away with huge satisfaction . ANGEL suddenly aware of the two strangers:Shine , mistah ? The tall fellow shakes his hand and turns away.A good shine . Come on ! To the other.Yew ? The squat man glares at him and growls , " Yuh cockeyed ? Ca n't yuh see we got one ? " p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine ? The DOORMAN comes to the gate and holds it open . A GOVERNESS , accompanied by a well-dressed , delicate-featured little boy , comes out of the Terrace Apartments . The GOVERNESS talks with a marked French accent . She nods to the DOORMAN . GOVERNESS Good afternoon . DOORMAN Good afternoon , ma'am . GOVERNESS But where is our chauffeur ? DOORMAN I think he 's on the corner with the cabdrivers . Shall I get him ? GOVERNESS Never mind . To the little boy.Wait here . Attends moi ici , mon cheri . The DOORMAN goes in , closing the gate behind him . The little boy , surveying the curious scene , answers , a bit distracted , " All right , I 'll " When he opens his mouth , he shows a shiny , gold orthodontic brace . GOVERNESS Mais , Philippe ! En franais ! PHILIP GRISWALD obediently : Oui , mademoiselle , j'attendrai . GOVERNESS Trs bien . J'y reviendrai de suite dans deux minutes . p. 13 PHILIP GRISWALD Oui , oui , mademoiselle . She hurries up the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's godda go wee-wee ! All the boys shout with laughter . DIPPY Do a swan-dive , Tommy . ' At 's wad I like . TOMMY MCGRATH OK . Hole my butt . He hands his cigarette to DIPPY.Hey , kid ! Hey , yew ! Hey , wee-wee ! PHILIP looks at him.Yuh wan na see sumpm ? A swan-dive . Watch ! TOMMY dashes off , under the hopper . We hear his " Whe-e-e " and a splash . The boys cluck approval . PHILIP GRISWALD What 's so wonderful about that ? ANGEL Aw , yuh fat tub a buttuh , it 's more'n yew kin do . PHILIP GRISWALD That shows how much you know . T. B. I bet a dollar he ca n't even swim . PHILIP GRISWALD I can too . T. B. Ah , balonee ! PHILIP GRISWALD Balonee yourself ! We 've a pool in there and I swim every day with instruction . SPIT Aw , bushwah ! TOMMY appears on the ladder . DIPPY hands him his cigarette . p. 14 DIPPY He sez dey godda pool in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sez it wuz lousy . TOMMY MCGRATH climbing over the parapet and crossing to PHILIP , belligerently:Oh yeah ? What wuza mattuh wid ' it ? Kin yew do betta ? PHILIP GRISWALD A trillion times . TOMMY MCGRATH Awright . Lessee yuh . PHILIP GRISWALD Where ? TOMMY MCGRATH Heah ! PHILIP GRISWALD Here ?

He 's yelluh , dat 's what ! Dat 's what ! He 's godda yelluh streak up ' is back a mile wide . PHILIP GRISWALD It 's dirty here . DIPPY shocked:Doity ! T. B. very indignant:Doity ! He sez doity .

PHILIP GRISWALD Sticks and stones may break my bones , but names will never hurt me . The boys crowd him back against the gate . TOMMY MCGRATH Ah , ahl spit in yuh eye an ' drown yuh . Hey , what 's ' at junk yuh got in yuh mout like a hawse ? PHILIP GRISWALD It 's a brace , to make my teeth straight . TOMMY MCGRATH Wha-a-at ? I could do dat wid ' one wallop ! The gang roars with laughter . PHILIP GRISWALD You try and you 'll be arrested . SPIT Yeah ? TOMMY MCGRATH contemptuously:Look who 's gon na arrest us ! p. 16 PHILIP GRISWALD My uncle 's a judge . TOMMY MCGRATH Balonee ! PHILIP GRISWALD Did you ever hear of Judge Griswald ? ANGEL So what ? So I know a guy whose brudduh 's a detective . He 'll git us out . T. B. Yeah ? Did yuh evuh hear a Judge Poikins ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? He sent me to rifawm school once . DOORMAN appears , bellowing:What 's the matter ? Get away from here , you ! They scatter , razzing him . He turns to PHILIP.Were they bothering you ? PHILIP GRISWALD No , I do n't pay any attention to them . The DOORMAN opens the gate and both he and PHILIP go in . The boys laugh and mock them . DIPPY , preoccupied with the phenomena of his body , suddenly discovers a lone hair on his chest . DIPPY Boy ! Gee ! Hey , I godda hair ! He caresses it , proudly . T.B . comes over , inspects the hair , admires it , then suddenly plucks it out , and runs away laughing and holding up the trophy . DIPPY yips , first with pain , then with rage . TOMMY finds an old discarded broom in the litter under the hopper . He balances it skillfully on the palm of his hand . p. 17 SPIT Gese , I 'm hungry ! TOMMY MCGRATH Me too ! ANGEL Boy , I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from his wounded chest:Boy , I could eat a hot dog . ANGEL Wid ' sour-kraut ! DIPPY Yeah . ANGEL licking his lips and patting his belly:Yum . SPIT Hey , should we go tuh Schultzie 's ' n ' see if we kin snitch sumpm ? TOMMY MCGRATH balancing the broom:Nah , Schultzie 's wise tuh us . ANGEL We could try some udduh staws . TOMMY MCGRATH still balancing the broom:Nah , dey 're all wise tuh us . Duh minute we walk in ' ey ask us wadda we want . If we had some dough , while one uv us wuz buyin ' sumpm de udduh guys could swipe some stuff , see ? I got faw cents , but ' at ain ' enough . He drops the broom , and becomes the man of action.Anybody got any dough heah ? Hey , yew , Angel , yuh got some ? ANGEL No , I ain ' . TOMMY MCGRATH Come on ! Don ' hole out ! p. 18 ANGEL Honest ! I didn ' git no customuh dis mawnin ' . TOMMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pants ! T.B . and SPIT rush to the hopper , grab ANGEL 's pants , and start rifling the pockets . ANGEL follows them , yelling . ANGEL Hey ! Git outa deah ! Git outa deah ! T. B. Nuttin ' but a couple a stamps ' n ' a boy-scout knife . SPIT taking the knife himself:Oh baby , kin I have dis ? ANGEL follows SPIT:No , I need it .

He grabs the knife and examines it.Gese , dat 's a knife ! Five blades ! Boy , I 'd like one like ' at . Enter from the lower tenement door , a young boy of about twelve , a bit timid , neatly dressed , obvious Semitic features . ANGEL Aw , Tommy , I need it . I godda use it . Honest ! TOMMY MCGRATH gives him his knife:Here ! Stop squawkin ' ! Don ' say I nevuh gave yuh nuttin ' ! ANGEL Tanks , Tommy . Dat 's white . TOMMY MCGRATH good-naturedly:Ah , shat ap ! To DIPPY , who sits reflectively picking his nose.Hey , Dippy ! Pick me a big juicy one ! DIPPY grins , rolls the resinous matter into a little ball , and flicks it at TOMMY . TOMMY laughs , and trots up the street to join the others who are seated on a tenement stoop . The TALL MAN turns from his conversation with his companion , and calls to DIPPY , " Hey , you ! " DIPPY What ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HUNK offers:I 'll go , chief . What is it ? DIPPY Sure . Wheah ? BABY-FACE MARTIN points to a tenement house up the block:418 fourth floor Mrs. Martin . Tell her a friend a hers wants a see her here . DIPPY O.K. 418 ? O.K. He trots off . GIMPTY who has looked up at the sound of the TALL ONE 's voice:Do n't I know you from somewhere ? The stranger 's lips compress  --  " no . " I could 've sworn I HUNK comes over and mutters in a thick voice full of threat:He said no , didn ' he ? The other restrains him with a touch on the arm . GIMPTY Sorry . He looks down at his drawing . The two walk away , and stand leaning against the wall , talking in low tones . The boys on the stoop suddenly notice the little Jewish boy who is peering over the wharf . T. B. Hey , look ! Deah 's ' at new kid ' at moved aroun ' a block . p. 21 SPIT ' At 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . TOMMY MCGRATH Hey , kid ! ANGEL Hey , kid ! MILTY SCHWARTZ looks up:Wadda yuh want ?

TOMMY MCGRATH to SPIT:Yuh godda watch-pocket , aincha ? SPIT Yeah . TOMMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPIT , who puts it in his pocket . They walk away , completely ignoring MILTY . MILTY SCHWARTZ follows them , murmuring tremulously:Gimme back my tree sants ! SPIT whispers to the others:Let 's cockalize him ! ANGEL Wadda yuh say , Tommy ? TOMMY MCGRATH O.K. T. B. Come on ! ANGEL crosses nonchalantly behind MILTY , then crouches on his hands and knees , unnoticed . The others turn and slowly approach him . Suddenly TOMMY pushes MILTY , who stumbles backward and trips over ANGEL , feet flying up . They all pounce on the prostrate boy , pin his arms and legs to the ground , unbutton his pants , pull up his shirt . p. 24 TOMMY MCGRATH Gim me some a dat doit ! SPIT scoops up a handful of dirt:Heah ! They rub it into MILTY 's groin . He kicks and screams , hysterically laughing at the sensation . When he 's through rubbing in the filth , TOMMY coughs up a huge wad of saliva and spits on MILTY 's organ . Each of them spit , once round the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tattoo of heels running down the street ! A whirlwind hits the group , and the boys are dispersed right and left . The whirlwind is a girl not much bigger than TOMMY , with a face resembling his  --  pushed-up nose and freckles . She slaps and pulls and pushes the boys , who scatter away , laughing and shouting . She stands there , eyes blazing . TOMMY MCGRATH Aw scram , will yuh , Drina ! Scram ! DRINA MCGRATH Shut up ! She helps the sobbing MILTY to his feet , brushes him off , and wipes his face , comforting him . On second glance she is not the child she seemed . Her simple dress , her hair combed back of the ears and held in place with a cheap celluloid clasp , her lithe , boyish figure combine to create the illusion of a very young girl . When she comforts MILTY , however , it is apparent in the mature quality of her solicitude that she is much older  --  in her earlier twenties . The TALL ONE grins at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 25 DRINA MCGRATH You ought to be ashamed of yourself , standing there and letting them pile up on this kid . TOMMY MCGRATH Aw , Drina , will yuh butt outa dis ? DRINA MCGRATH to the snivelling boy:Are you hurt ? To the TALL ONE.Why did n't you stop ' em ? BABY-FACE MARTIN What fer ? It 'll do ' im good . DRINA MCGRATH furiously:Oh , yeah ? I suppose it 'll do you good if I crack your face , huh ? BABY-FACE MARTIN Oh , lady , yuh scare me ! DRINA MCGRATH Fresh guy , huh ? HUNK walks over to her , his face screwed up in disgust:Shut yuh big mouth or I 'll BABY-FACE MARTIN sharply:Hunk ! Cut it ! HUNK obeys instantly . They walk away to the bulwark . TOMMY MCGRATH Aw , Drina , why dontcha butt outa my business ? DRINA MCGRATH Wait till I get you home , I 'll show you butt out of TOMMY scratches his head . She places her hands on her hips and frowns.What are you scratchin ' your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternal concern gives her the air of a little girl playing house . p. 26 TOMMY MCGRATH Aw , git out a heah or I 'll bust yuh one ! DRINA MCGRATH That 's fine talk , Tommy bust you one ! He scratches again.There you go again ! Scratchin ' ! She crosses to him.Come on home ! I 'm gon na wash your head . TOMMY MCGRATH Aw , lemme alone . All a time yuh bodderin ' me . Runs away from DRINA and climbs up the hopper like a monkey , out of her reach . DRINA MCGRATH to GIMPTY:Pete , why did n't you stop ' em ? GIMPTY I 'm sorry , Drina . I did n't notice what was happenin ' . I was thinkin ' about somethin ' . DRINA MCGRATH Yeah ?

Now let 's see what you 're going to do with them . An ' if you ca n't do anything with them , then I 'll take ' em all away . Yeah , I 'll take away your reason as sure as I took away the head of the oyster , and your sense of beauty as I took away the flight of the ostrich , and men will crawl on their bellies on the ground like snakes or die off altogether like the dinosaur .

The Two GIRLS go up the street , one indignant , the other giggling . KAY has picked up GIMPTY 's drawings and is admiring them . DRINA stares enviously at KAY , at her modish coiffure , at her smart suit , at her shoes . KAY becomes conscious of the scrutiny and turns . DRINA MCGRATH embarrassed , drops her eyes , then calls to TOMMY:Tommy ! Coming ? TOMMY MCGRATH from the water:No-o-o ! DRINA MCGRATH Well , I 'm goin ' home . I ca n't wait here all day . She goes .

Oh , yeah he 's a good man . Thanks ! Gee ! Thanks ! KAY MITCHELL I do n't know if it 'll help much . GIMPTY This is swell of you ! He looks at her a moment , lost in admiration . Then shyly , with a good deal of hesitation and groping for the right words:I was telling Mom about you last night . I been kind of going around the house like a chicken with its head chopped off and Mom asked me why . So I told her . KAY MITCHELL What ? GIMPTY Oh , just a little about you .

KAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIMPTY How long will you be gone ? KAY MITCHELL About three months . p. 58 GIMPTY That 's a long time . KAY MITCHELL Yes . Down the street strides JACK HILTON , a well-dressed , rather handsome man in his early forties , hard lines around the eyes . At the moment he is hot and uncomfortable . He eyes the tenements curiously as he passes them . The DOORMAN appears as he starts to enter the gate . He asks the DOORMAN in a cultured , quiet voice , " What happened in front ? " DOORMAN I 'll tell you , Mr. Hilton . You see , the gas mains KAY MITCHELL rises:Hello , Jack ! JACK HILTON turns around , sees KAY . Surprised:Hello ! What 're you doing here ? He crosses to her .

Dippy patting his chest and gloating : " Attaboy , Dippy ! " goes back into the water . HILTON is puzzled and annoyed . He looks at KAY . JACK HILTON What 's all this about ? KAY MITCHELL Nothing . JACK HILTON his voice begins to rasp:Come on . Let 's go in . KAY MITCHELL It 's nice out . I 'd like to take a walk first . JACK HILTON You 'll do that later . Come on .

JACK HILTON We 've a million things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right in . JACK HILTON casts a glance at GIMPTY:What 's the big attraction out here ? p. 60 KAY MITCHELL Nothing . JACK HILTON Then stop acting like a prima donna and come on in . KAY MITCHELL Please do n't make a fuss . JACK HILTON suddenly loses his temper and snaps:It 's not me it 's you ! Damn it , I 've been tearing around all day like a madman , and I come home and find you behaving like a cheap KAY MITCHELL Jack ! JACK HILTON bites his lip , controls himself , and mutters curtly:All right ! Stay there ! He goes in . KAY follows him to the gate , pauses there , uncertain . Then indulges in a momentary flash of temper , herself . KAY MITCHELL Oh let him ! She returns slowly . GIMPTY Is that the guy ? KAY MITCHELL Yes . Then , not to be unfair.Do n't judge him by this . He 's really not so bad . He 's going to be sorry in a few minutes . He 's so darn jealous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't blame him for GIMPTY suddenly inflamed:All right ! If it were anybody else , all right ! But you ? He ca n't treat you like that ! p. 61 KAY MITCHELL sits there a while in silence , thinking . Finally , she speaks , slowly , almost in explanation to herself:I 've been living with Jack a little over a year now . He is n't usually like this . You see , he really loves me . GIMPTY He has a funny way of showing it . KAY MITCHELL He wants me to marry him . GIMPTY Are you going to ? KAY MITCHELL I do n't know . GIMPTY Do you love him ? KAY MITCHELL I like him . GIMPTY Is that enough ? KAY MITCHELL I 've known what it means to scrimp and worry and never be sure from one minute to the next . I 've had enough of that for one lifetime . GIMPTY intensely:But Kay , not to look forward to love God , that 's not living at all ! KAY MITCHELL not quite convincingly:I can do without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , is it ? KAY MITCHELL smiles wryly:Of course not . A very stout LADY , with much bosom , comes out of the gate , fondling a tiny , black dog . p. 62 TOMMY MCGRATH clambering over the parapet , sees the dog and chuckles:Look a dat cockaroach , will yuh ?

Wooden heads are inherited , but not wooden legs nor legs twisted by rickets ! The FAT LADY is completely taken aback by this unexpected antipathy . She looks at KAY , gasps , and walks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at GIMPTY sadly , sympathetically . GIMPTY I 'm sorry . KAY MITCHELL touches his hand:Oh , Pete ! Another outburst .

GIMPTY Yep . KAY MITCHELL Did n't he have anything for you ? GIMPTY Oh , we had a nice talk . He 's a very interesting guy . He showed me some of his work . He 's done some pretty good stuff .

KAY MITCHELL I did n't know how important it was until yesterday . GIMPTY Hey , there ! KAY MITCHELL I used to think we were poor at home because I had to wear a made-over dress to a prom . Yesterday I saw the real thing . If I had n't seen it , I could n't have believed it . I dreamt of it all night the filth , the smells , the dankness ! I touched a wall and it was wet . She touches her fingertips , recalling the unpleasant tactile sensation . She shivers . GIMPTY That house was rotten before I was born . The plumbing is so old and broken it 's been dripping through the building for ages . p. 87 KAY MITCHELL What tears my heart out is the thought that you have to live there . It 's not fair ! It 's not right ! GIMPTY It 's not right that anybody should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us do . KAY MITCHELL Million ? GIMPTY Yeah , right here in New York New York with its famous skyline its Empire State , the biggest Goddamned building in the world . The biggest tombstone in the world ! They wanted to build a monument to the times . Well , there it is , bigger than the pyramids and just as many tenants . He forces her to smile with him . Then he sighs , and adds , hopelessly:I wonder when they 'll let us build houses for men to live in ? Suddenly annoyed with himself.Ah , I should never have let you see that place ! KAY MITCHELL I 'm glad you did . I know so much more about you now . And I ca n't tell you how much more I respect you for coming out of that fine , and sweet and sound . GIMPTY his eyes drop to his withered limb:Let 's not get started on that . PHILIP can be heard sobbing in the tenement hallway . He flings open the door and rushes out , down the street into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gang follows him from the hallway , yelling and laughing . p. 88 TOMMY MCGRATH holding PHILIP 's watch:Come on , let 's git dressed an ' beat it ! SPIT Let 's grab a quick swim foist . TOMMY MCGRATH Nah ! SPIT Come on ! MILTY SCHWARTZ Betteh not . SPIT rushes off under the hopper and dives into the water:Las ' one in 's a stinkin ' rotten egg ! TOMMY MCGRATH throws the watch to T.B.:Guard ' at watch and lay chickee ! All the boys except T.B . dive into the water . GIMPTY When I see what it 's doing to those kids I get so mad I want to tear down these lice nests with my fingers ! KAY MITCHELL You ca n't stay here . You 've got to get out . Oh , I wish I could help you ! GIMPTY But you have . Do n't you see ? KAY MITCHELL No . I 'm not that important . GIMPTY Yes , you are ! KAY MITCHELL I must n't be . Nobody must .

Maybe I should n't have gone with you yesterday . Maybe it was a mistake . I did n't realize quite how much I loved you . I think I ought to leave tonight . GIMPTY Why ? KAY MITCHELL Yes , I 'd better . The chug of a small boat is heard . GIMPTY Why ? KAY MITCHELL I 'd better get away while we can still do something about this . GIMPTY How will that help ? KAY MITCHELL If I stay , I do n't know what will happen , except that we 'll go on and in the end make ourselves thoroughly miserable . We 'd be so wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see it . KAY MITCHELL I do , and I think I 'm right . Pause . She looks out over the river.There 's the boat . p. 90 GIMPTY pauses . Turns to look:Is that it ? KAY MITCHELL Yes . GIMPTY irrelevantly , to conceal his emotion . In a dull monotone:It 's a knockout . I 'm crazy about good boats . They 're beautiful , because they 're designed to work . That 's the way houses should be built like boats . KAY MITCHELL Pete , will you be here tonight before I leave ? MARTIN looks up from his newspaper to eye KAY . GIMPTY Do n't go , Kay . I 'll do anything . Is n't there some way something ? KAY MITCHELL hopelessly:What ? Rises.I guess I 'll go in now , and get my things ready . I 'll see you later ? She presses his shoulder and exits . MARTIN rises , throws down his newspaper and approaches GIMPTY . BABY-FACE MARTIN sucks his lips , making a nasty , suggestive sound:Say dat 's a pretty fancy-lookin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Good lay ? GIMPTY glares at him . MARTIN laughs.Well , fer Chris ' sake , what 's a matter ? Ca n't yuh talk ? p. 91 GIMPTY Cut it out , Martin . Just cut it out ! BABY-FACE MARTIN Lissen , kid , why don ' yuh git wise tuh yerself ?

A chuckle of contempt.Look what wansa fight wid ' me ! Little Gimpty wansa fight wid ' me ! Wassamattuh , Gimpty ? Wan na git knocked off ? HUNK slouches down the street , followed in a painfully weary shuffle by a gaunt , raw-boned , unkempt woman , sloppy and disheveled . Her one garment , an ancient housedress retrieved from some garbage heap , black with grease stains . Her legs are stockingless , knotted and bulging with blue , twisted , cord-like veins . Her feet show through the cracks in her house slippers . In contrast to the picture of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved out of granite ; as if infinite suffering had been met with dogged , unyielding strength . HUNK Hey ! She comes to a dead stop as she sees MARTIN . There is no other sign of recognition , no friendliness on her lips . She stares at him out of dull , hostile eyes . MARTIN 's face lights , he grins . He steps rapidly toward her:Hello , Mom ! How are yuh ? Pause.It 's me . No recognition.I had my face fixed . There is a moment of silence . She finally speaks in an almost inaudible monotone . p. 92 MRS . MARTIN Yuh no-good tramp ! BABY-FACE MARTIN Mom ! MRS . MARTIN What 're yuh doin ' here ? BABY-FACE MARTIN Ai nt cha glad tuh see me ? She suddenly smacks him a sharp crack across the cheek . MRS . MARTIN That 's how glad I am . BABY-FACE MARTIN rubs his cheek , stunned by this unexpected reception .

That 's where yuh come from . God ! I ought to be cut open here fer givin ' yuh life murderer ! ! ! She shuffles away , up the street , weeping quietly . MARTIN stands there looking after her for a long time . His hand goes to his cheek . HUNK comes down to him , clucking sympathetically . A boat whistle is heard . p. 94 HUNK How da yuh like ' at !

You ought to be wiped out ! BABY-FACE MARTIN his face twitching , the veins on his forehead standing out , kicks GIMPTY 's crippled foot and shouts:Shut up ! GIMPTY gasps in pain , glaring at MARTIN . After a long pause , quietly , deliberately:All right . O.K. , Martin ! Just wait ! BABY-FACE MARTIN What ? Reaches for his shoulder holster.What 's ' at ? GIMPTY Go on ! Shoot me ! That 'll bring ' em right to you ! Go on ! BABY-FACE MARTIN hesitates . He is interrupted by the excited voices of GRISWALD and PHILIP . Cautiously he restrains himself and whispers:I 'll talk to yuh later . I 'll be waitin ' right up thuh street , see ? Watch yuh step . GRISWALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The GOVERNESS tries to quiet PHILIP while she dabs his face with her handkerchief . MARTIN goes up the street . p. 96 MR . GRISWALD It 's all right , Son ! Now stop crying ! What happened ?

The DOORMAN comes out of the gateway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . GRISWALD jerking his head toward the fleeing boys:Catch those boys ! The DOORMAN lumbers up the street in pursuit . GRISWALD takes a handkerchief from his breast pocket and presses it to his wrist . Blood seeps through . GRISWALD , self-controlled now , tries to quiet the sobbing PHILIP.It 's all right , son , it 's all right ! No , no , no ! Now stop crying . Let me have your handkerchief ! GIMPTY Are you hurt ? p. 101 MR . GRISWALD What do you think ? GIMPTY Can I help ? MR . GRISWALD It 's a little late for that now .

Qu'est-ce qui se passe , mon petit ? PHILIP GRISWALD That boy stuck him with a knife ! GOVERNESS to GRISWALD : Mon Dieu ! Are you hurt , monsieur ?

DOORMAN impressively , rolling the sound on his tongue:Mr . Griswald . CHARLES , the chauffeur , saunters down the sidewalk . p. 105 MULLIGAN What of it ? DOORMAN Do n't you know ? He 's Judge Griswald 's brother . MULLIGAN his attitude changes:Oh ! DOORMAN to the CHAUFFEUR , who has reached the gate:Oh , I do n't think Mr. Griswald 'll be using the car now . He was just hurt . CHARLES Wha-a-at ? What happened ? DOORMAN He was stabbed . It 's a long story . I 'll tell you later . CHARLES concerned:Well , will you call him and see if he wants me ? DOORMAN starting off:Yeah .

MULLIGAN annoyed:Well , what were they like ? GIMPTY About so high dirty an ' naked . MULLIGAN impatiently:And they socked that young jalopee in the eye . Yeah . I got that much myself . But that might be any kid in this neighborhood . Anything else ? GIMPTY No . MULLIGAN slaps his book shut:Why the hell did n't I learn a trade ? He starts toward the gate . DRINA comes down the street and approaches GIMPTY . She looks tired and bedraggled . She has an ugly bruise on her forehead . GIMPTY to DRINA:Hey , what 's the matter with your head ? p. 107 DRINA MCGRATH looking at MULLIGAN and raising her voice:We were picketing the store , an ' some lousy cop hit me . MULLIGAN wheels around , insulted:What 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MULLIGAN You better watch your language or you 'll get another clout ! DRINA MCGRATH Go on and try it ! GIMPTY urging discretion:Sh ! MULLIGAN Listen ! I 'm in no mood to be tampered with . I 'm in no mood ! Not by a lousy Red . DRINA MCGRATH quietly:I ai n't no Red .

They hit us right and left . Three of the girls were hurt bad . GIMPTY I 'll give you some advice about your brother . DRINA MCGRATH I was just lookin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to keep away from here or he 's in for a lot of trouble . DRINA MCGRATH sits down , exhausted , and sighs:What 's he done now ? GIMPTY Plenty . DRINA MCGRATH What ? GIMPTY Just tell him to keep away . DRINA MCGRATH Gosh , I do n't know what to do with that boy ! A passing boat hoots twice . DRINA ponders her problem a moment.There 's a feller I know is always askin ' me to marry him . Maybe I ought to do that , hm ? For Tommy he 's rich . What should I do ? GIMPTY disinterested , too absorbed in his own problem:That 's up to you . DRINA MCGRATH Most of the girls at the store are always talkin ' about marryin ' a rich guy . I used to laugh at ' em . She laughs now at herself . p. 109 GIMPTY Maybe they 're right . DRINA MCGRATH looks at him:That does n't sound like you . GIMPTY No ? How do you know what goes on inside of me ? DRINA MCGRATH shakes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRINA MCGRATH very tender and soft . She knows he 's suffering:What 's the matter ? GIMPTY Nothing . DRINA MCGRATH I understand . GIMPTY You ca n't . DRINA MCGRATH Why ca n't I ? Suddenly exasperated.Sometimes , for a boy as bright as you , with your education , you talk like a fool . Do n't you think I got a heart too ? Do n't you think there are nights when I cry myself to sleep ? Do n't you think I know what it means to be lonely and scared and to want somebody ? God , ai n't I human ? Am I so homely that I ai n't got a right to GIMPTY No , Drina ! I think you 're a swell girl . You are . DRINA MCGRATH turns away , annoyed at his patronage:Oh , do n't give me any of that taffy ! You do n't even know I 'm alive ! p. 110 GIMPTY Why do you say that ? DRINA MCGRATH What 's the difference ? It do n't matter . Only I hate to see you butting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to hurt yourself . GIMPTY What 're you talking about ? DRINA MCGRATH You know . Oh , I think that lady 's beautiful and I think she 's nice . GIMPTY angry:Look ! Will you be a good girl and mind your own business ? DRINA MCGRATH She 's not for you ! GIMPTY Why not ? MULLIGAN comes out of the East River Terrace , notebook and pencil in hand . He goes to GIMPTY . MULLIGAN Well , I got something to work on , anyway . Do you know a kid named Tommy-something around here ? DRINA starts , but checks herself . GIMPTY No . MULLIGAN They heard the others call him Tommy . Jerks his head toward the gate.You know what he 's liable to do ? With his pull ? Have me broke , maybe . The first thing I know , I 'll be pounding a lousier post than this ! Harlem , maybe . Get a knife in my back . Looks up from his notebook , to DRINA.Hey , you ! p. 111 DRINA MCGRATH What ? MULLIGAN You live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MULLIGAN Know a kid named Tommy-something ? DRINA MCGRATH No no , I do n't . MULLIGAN studying his notes:I 'll catch him . I 'll skin him alive ! DRINA MCGRATH finally ventures:What 'd he do ? MULLIGAN Pulled a knife on some high muck-a-muck in there . DRINA MCGRATH No ! MULLIGAN Yeah . Ah , it do n't pay to be nice to these kids . It just do n't pay . DRINA MCGRATH Was the man hurt ? MULLIGAN Yeah . It looks like a pretty deep cut . Lord , he 's fit to be tied ! I never seen a guy so boined up ! DRINA turns and goes up the street , restraining her impulse to run . MULLIGAN jabbers on , complainingly.This is a tough enough precinct but Harlem ?  --  There 's a lousy precinct ! A pal of mine got killed there last year Left a wife and a couple a kids . GIMPTY Is that so ? p. 112 MULLIGAN Yeah . GIMPTY Too bad ! As the idea begins to take form.Well maybe you can catch Baby-face Martin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward . MULLIGAN Yeah . GIMPTY Then you could retire . MULLIGAN Yeah , you could do a lot on that . GIMPTY Yeah , I guess you could . Say tell me something . MULLIGAN What ? GIMPTY Supposin ' supposin ' a fellow knew where that er Baby-face Martin is located . How would he go about reporting him and making sure of not getting gypped out of the reward ? MULLIGAN Just phone police headquarters or the Department of Justice direct . They 'd be down here in two minutes . He looks at GIMPTY and asks ironically:Why ? You do n't know where he is , do you ? GIMPTY smiles wanly back at him:Colorado , the newspapers say . No , I was just wonderin ' . MULLIGAN Well , whoever turns that guy in is taking an awful chance . He 's a killer . p. 113 GIMPTY Well you ca n't live forever . A passing tug shrieks its warning signal . And shrieks again . MARTIN walks , cat-footed , down the street . MULLIGAN That 's right . GUMPTY turns , sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MULLIGAN Sure . GIMPTY crosses to the other side of the street and walks away , pretending not to notice MARTIN . BABY-FACE MARTIN Hello , Gimpty ! GIMPTY accelerates his pace and hobbles off . MARTIN sucks his teeth for a second , thinking . Then he adopts an amiable smile and approaches MULLIGAN.Kinda quiet today , ain ' it , Officer ? MULLIGAN Not with these kids around . BABY-FACE MARTIN jerks his head in GIMPTY 's direction:Dat 's a nice feller . Friend a mine . HUNK has entered from up the street just after GIMPTY 's exit . He is lighting a cigar , when he sees MARTIN in friendly conversation with the archenemy . He stands there , transfixed , match to cigar . MULLIGAN I had quite a talk with him . p. 114 BABY-FACE MARTIN fishing:What about ? MULLIGAN Oh about these kids here . BABY-FACE MARTIN Zat all ? MULLIGAN Say , that 's plenty ! He puts his notebook in his pocket. You do n't happen to know a kid around here named Tommy-something , do you ? BABY-FACE MARTIN shakes his head:Uh-uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ! He strides up the sidewalk . MARTIN watches him , then laughs . The match burns HUNK 's fingers . He drops it . HUNK Jesus ! BABY-FACE MARTIN laughing:A pal a mine . HUNK Dat 's crazy . BABY-FACE MARTIN Dey don ' know me wid ' dis mug . HUNK sighs . This is too much for him . Then he remembers his errand:Say , dat dame is heah . BABY-FACE MARTIN Who ?

Maybe yuhr a mistake . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll git huh now . He starts off . A young girl comes down the street , an obvious whore of the lowest class , wearing her timeless profession defiantly . A pert , pretty little face still showing traces of quality and something once sweet and fine . Skin an unhealthy pallor , lips a smear of rouge . Her mop of dyed red hair is lusterless , strawy , dead from too much alternate bleach and henna . She carries herself loosely . Droop-shouldered . Voluptuous S-shaped posture . There are no clothes under her cheap , faded , green silk dress , cut so tight that it reveals the nipples of her full breasts , her navel , the " V " of her crotch , the muscles of her buttocks . She has obviously dressed hastily , carelessly ; one stocking streaked with runs dribbles down at the ankle . She accosts HUNK , impatiently . p. 116 FRANCEY Hey , what ta hell 's ee idear , keepin ' me standin ' on a corner all day ? I 'm busy . I got ta git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face ? MARTIN looks at her . BABY-FACE MARTIN Francey ! Jesus , what 's come over yuh ? FRANCEY turning sharply to Martin:How do yew know my name ? Who are yew ? Impatiently.Well , who th ' hell Then she recognizes him , and gasps.Fuh th ' love a God ! Marty ! BABY-FACE MARTIN never taking his eyes off the girl:Yeah . Hunk scram !

FRANCEY Yuh did somethin ' to yuh face . BABY-FACE MARTIN Yeah . Plastic , dey call it . FRANCEY They said yuh wuz out aroun ' Coloradah  --  th ' noospapuhs ! Gee , I 'm glad to see yuh ! MARTIN slips his arm around her waist and draws her tight to his body . As his lips grope for hers , FRANCEY turns her face away . MARTIN tries to pull her face around . She cries furiously:No don ' kiss me on a lips ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter ? He ca n't believe this . He frowns.I ai n't good enough for yuh ? FRANCEY quickly:No . It ai n't dat .

FRANCEY acquiescing:Ony don ' kiss me on a lips ! BABY-FACE MARTIN Closuh ! They stand there a moment , bodies close , passionate . MARTIN buries his face in her hair . FRANCEY eyes closed , whispers:Marty ! BABY-FACE MARTIN Dose times unduh da stairs FRANCEY A couple a crazy kids we were ! We wuz gon na git married . I bought a ring at da five an ' dime staw . BABY-FACE MARTIN Yeah . Ony we didn ' have money enough fuh de license . Gee , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heah. p. 119 FRANCEY Yestiddy ! It seems like a million yeahs ! BABY-FACE MARTIN as voices are heard coming from the East River Terrace:Wait ! They separate . He draws his hat over his eyes and turns away as a young couple come out of the gate and walk up the street . GIRL So many people standing around . What 's all the excitement ? What 's happened ? MAN The elevator man said someone was stabbed . GIRL Really ? Who was it , do you know ? MAN Mr. Griswald , I think he said . Twelfth floor . GIRL Oh ! Yes ? Did he say who did it ? MAN He said one of the kids around here somewhere . When they are well out of sight , FRANCEY clutches MARTIN 's arm . FRANCEY Marty , listen ! Yuh got ta take care a yuhself .

I 'll scram if yew come wid ' me . FRANCEY Ah , what do yuh want me fer ? A broken-down hoor . BABY-FACE MARTIN Shut up ! FRANCEY I wouldn ' be good fuh yuh . BABY-FACE MARTIN I know what I want .

FRANCEY But I 'm sick , Marty ! Do n't yuh see ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' yuh ? FRANCEY almost inaudibly:What do yuh think ? MARTIN looks at her for a long time . He sees her . The nostalgic dream is finished . His lips begin to curl in disgust . BABY-FACE MARTIN Why didncha git a job ? p. 121 FRANCEY Dey don grow on trees ! BABY-FACE MARTIN Why didncha starve foist ? FRANCEY Why didnchou ? MARTIN makes no effort to conceal his growing disgust . Turns away . FRANCEY suddenly shouts , fiercely , at the top of her lungs:Well , what ta hell did yuh expect ? BABY-FACE MARTIN I don ' know . A passing tug shrieks hoarsely . The echo floats back . FRANCEY quietly , clutching at a hope:Maybe if yuh got da dough yuh git a doctuh an ' he fixes me up BABY-FACE MARTIN Nah . Once at stuff gits in yuh nah ! Again the tug shrieks and is answered by its echo . He reaches into his inner breast pocket , extracts a fat roll of bills , peels off several , and hands them to her.Heah . Buy yerself somethin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some roll yuh got . Yuh cud choke a hoss wid ' dat . BABY-FACE MARTIN thrusting it at her:Heah ! p. 122 FRANCEY takes the money:Is it hot ?

Not if dey tied me ta wild hosses , I would n't . BABY-FACE MARTIN Bettuh not . FRANCEY folds her money , still fascinated by the huge roll of bills in his hand . Her voice takes on a peculiar whining , wheedling quality:Honey ! BABY-FACE MARTIN Yeah ? FRANCEY Cud yuh spare another twenty bucks ? I godda BABY-FACE MARTIN No ! FRANCEY Aw , come on , dearie ! BABY-FACE MARTIN No ! FRANCEY Do n't be a tightwad ! BABY-FACE MARTIN reaching the limit of his disgust:What ta hell do yuh t'ink I am ? Some guy yuh got up in yuh room ? I 'll He raises his hand , ready to slap her . Again the shriek of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frightened:Nah , ferget it , Marty ! I wuz just BABY-FACE MARTIN Awright ! Awright ! Now beat it ! FRANCEY O.K. , Marty . She starts to go , pauses , turns back.Fer old times ' sakes , will yuh do me a favor ? Please ? BABY-FACE MARTIN shoves the money back into his pocket:No ! FRANCEY Not dat . BABY-FACE MARTIN What ? FRANCEY Will yuh kiss me ! Heah ? Ona cheek ? Jus ' fuh old times ' sakes ? Come on . He hesitates . She comes close , presses her cheek against his lips . He pecks her cheek , and turns away , scowling . She laughs , a low bitter laugh , at his obvious disrelish.Thanks ! She goes up the street slowly , her purse swinging carelessly , her body swaying invitation , the tired march of her profession . The shriek of the tug is drawn out and distant now . The echo lingers . MARTIN spits and wipes the kiss off his lips with a groan of distaste . HUNK comes down the sidewalk , slowly:Well ? BABY-FACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Yeah ! HUNK Twice in one day . Deah yuh ah ! I toldja we shouldn ' a come back . But yuh wouldn ' lissen a me . Yuh nevuh lissen a me . BABY-FACE MARTIN Yeah .

Bet she 's waitin ' fuh yuh wid ' welcome ona doormat . BABY-FACE MARTIN Awright ! Don ' talk about dames , Hunk , will yuh ? Fuhget ' em . All cats look alike inna dahk . Fuhget ' em . A little girl comes out of the gate , bouncing a rubber ball . MARTIN looks at her , thinks a moment , turns to watch her go up the street . He sucks his teeth a moment , thinking . HUNK Listen , Marty . Let 's git outa heah . Too many people know yuh heah . Whaddaya say ? BABY-FACE MARTIN Sh ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go shoot a game a pillpool . Starts to go up the street . BABY-FACE MARTIN motions him back , turns to stare at the Terrace Apartments:Wait a minute . HUNK returns.Yuh know , Hunk . He shakes a thumb at the Apartment.Der 's a pile a tin in ' ere . p. 125 HUNK Yeah . BABY-FACE MARTIN Didja see what dese kids did heah today ? HUNK No . BABY-FACE MARTIN ' Ey got one a dese rich little squoits in a hallway , slapped him around , an ' robbed his watch . HUNK So what ? A man appears on the terrace , watches them for a second , and then slips away . Two men come down the street talking casually , one of them goes into the tenement , the other , waiting for him , wanders over back of the hopper and is hidden from view . BABY-FACE MARTIN glances at them , lowers his voice:Maybe we kin pull a snatch kidnap one a dese babies . HUNK We 're too hot . Foolin ' round wid ' kids ain ' our racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTIN Stop yuh yammerin ' ! Git a hold a Whitey . See wot he knows about duh mugs in heah ! HUNK hesitates.Come on , Hunk , git goin ' ! HUNK O.K. Yuh duh boss ! He goes reluctantly . The tap of GIMPTY 's cane on the sidewalk is heard approaching , its rhythmic click ominous . GIMPTY appears , tight-lipped , pale , grim . MARTIN smiles out of one corner of his lips , and throws him a conciliatory greeting . p. 126 BABY-FACE MARTIN Hello , Gimpty ! GIMPTY turns away without answering . MARTIN , amused , laughs . He is suddenly in a good mood . The man who spied on him from the terrace appears in the gateway and catches GIMPTY 's eye . GIMPTY points his cane at MARTIN . The good mood passes . MARTIN 's eyebrows pull together in one puzzled line . BABY-FACE MARTIN What 's eatin yuh , wise guy ? The man behind the gate draws a revolver , comes quickly up behind MARTIN , and digs the gun in his back . FIRST G-MAN Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants you ! BABY-FACE MARTIN What ta hell ! Tries to turn , but the revolver prods him back . FIRST G-MAN Come on , get ' em up ! BABY-FACE MARTIN hands up:I ai n't Martin . My name 's Johnson . Wan na see my license ? He slides his hand into his breast pocket . FIRST G-MAN If you 're smart , you 'll behave yourself ! BABY-FACE MARTIN wheels around , draws his gun , and fires in one motion:No , yuh do n't The G-MAN drops his gun , crumples onto the sidewalk , holding his belly and kicking . MARTIN turns to face GIMPTY , who has backed away to the hopper . MARTIN , his face black and contorted , aims at GIMPTY.So yuh ratted , yuh From behind the hopper and the tenement doorway , guns explode . Two other G-MEN appear and descend on MARTIN , firing as they come . MARTIN groans , wheels , and falls , his face in the gutter , his fingers clawing the sidewalk . One of the G-MEN goes to aid his wounded comrade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet after bullet into him , literally nailing him to the ground . The G-MAN kicks him to make sure he 's dead . No twitch ! MARTIN lies there flat . The G-MAN takes out a handkerchief , picks up MARTIN 's gun gingerly , wraps it in the handkerchief , puts it in his pocket . p. 127 SECOND G-MAN Where 'd he get you , Bob ? Come on , sit up here ! Helps him to sit against the coping . FIRST G-MAN presses his hand in agony to his wound . From the street there is a rising babble of voices . Tenement windows are thrown up , heads thrust out ; the curious crowd to the edge of the terrace , come to the gate , run down the street , collect in small groups , discussing the macabre scene in excited , hushed murmur . A LADY comes out of the gate , sees the dead man , screams hysterically , and is helped off by the DOORMAN . MULLIGAN comes tearing down the street , revolver drawn . He forces his way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! To the THIRD G-MAN.What 's this ? THIRD G-MAN taking out a badge in a leather case from inside his coat pocket and holding it up:It 's all right , officer . Department of Justice ! Replaces the badge . MULLIGAN What happened ? Who 's this guy ? THIRD G-MAN Baby-face Martin . MULLIGAN Is that him ? THIRD G-MAN Yep . MULLIGAN Gese , I was talkin ' to him a couple of minutes ago . SECOND G-MAN Get an ambulance , quick ! Will you ? p. 128 MULLIGAN crosses to the police box , opens it:Box 10 Mulligan . Send ambulance ! Make all notifications ! Baby-face Martin was just shot by Federal men . He winged one of ' em . I do n't know yeah here . Gese , I was talking to him myself a few minutes ago . Hell , Sarge , I could n't recognize him . His face is all made over . He hangs up . The shrill siren of a radio car mounts to a crescendo , mingles with the screech of brakes , and is suddenly silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crowd . They are followed by SPIT , wearing a single roller skate . He edges his way to the front of the crowd . SECOND POLICEMAN Hi , Mulligan . What have yuh got here ? MULLIGAN Baby-face Martin ! THIRD POLICEMAN Did you git him ? MULLIGAN No such luck . The Federal men got him . He winged one of them . Gestures toward the wounded G-MAN . SECOND POLICEMAN Did you notify the house ? MULLIGAN Yeah . I gave ' em everything . Lend us a hand , will yuh . Git rid of this crowd . MULLIGAN stands by MARTIN 's body , writing in a notebook . The other POLICEMEN push back the crowd . SPIT slips through , and looks at the dead man with scared curiosity . p. 129 SECOND POLICEMAN pushing the crowd:Break it up ! This is no circus . Come on , break it up ! GIRL IN THE CROWD Do n't push me ! SECOND POLICEMAN Well , go on home ! Go on , break it up ! SECOND G-MAN to the wounded agent:How you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G-MAN You 'll be O.K. FIRST G-MAN I do n't know I do n't know ! I should 've plugged him right away in the back . You do n't give a snake like that a break . Anyway , we got him ! That 's something ! SECOND G-MAN Sure you did , Bob . You 'll get cited for this . FIRST G-MAN That 's dandy ! That 's just dandy ! Give the medal to my old lady for the kids to play with an ' remember they once had an old man who was a hero ! THIRD G-MAN Aw , cut it , Bob . You 'll be O.K. Do n't talk like that ! DOORMAN pushing through the crowd:Officer ! Officer ! MULLIGAN Get outa here ! You with the rest of them . Come on , get back ! p. 130 DOORMAN Officer , this is important ! That 's one of the boys there , that one ! He 's one of the gang ! MULLIGAN What boy ? What the hell are you talkin ' about ? DOORMAN The one who stabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOORMAN pointing:That one there ! He 's one of the gang . MULLIGAN Are you sure ? DOORMAN Yes yes I 'll swear to it ! MULLIGAN Come here ! Hey you ! Runs over to SPIT , grabs his arm . The murmur of the crowd rises . SPIT Lemme go ! I didn ' do nuttin ' . Lemme go ! SECOND POLICEMAN What is this kid got to do with it ? MULLIGAN That 's somethin ' else . The clang of an approaching ambulance comes to a sudden halt . Enter , pushing their way down the street , an INTERN carrying a doctor 's bag , followed by an AMBULANCE MAN carrying a folded stretcher , which encloses a pillow and a rolled blanket . The murmur of the crowd hushes . INTERN Hello , Mulligan. p. 131 MULLIGAN Hello , Doc . To SECOND POLICEMAN.Hold this kid a minute . SECOND POLICEMAN grabs SPIT 's arm and drags him back to the crowd on the sidewalk . INTERN What 's up ? He comes down to the body . MULLIGAN Just got Baby-face Martin ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INTERN You did ? He glances at the body.He wo n't need me ! SECOND G-MAN Hey , Doc , look at this man ! The INTERN kneels to the wounded man , examines his wound , sponges it , places a pad over it. It 's not bad , is it , Doc ? INTERN cheerfully:Not very bad , but we 'd better rush him off to the hospital . Here , somebody help get him on the stretcher . The AMBULANCE MAN opens the stretcher , places the pillow at the head . SECOND G-MAN and MULLIGAN lift the wounded G-MAN carefully and lay him on the stretcher with words of encouragement . The AMBULANCE MAN unrolls the blanket over him . SECOND G-MAN and the AMBULANCE DRIVER carry the wounded man up the sidewalk , calling " Gangway ! " The THIRD G-MAN accompanies them , holding the wounded man 's hand and talking to him . The crowd open a path , and stare , their murmur silenced for a moment . p. 132 MULLIGAN pointing to MARTIN:Want to look at this guy , Doc ? INTERN kneels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cursorily inspects the wounds , rolls back the eyelid , applies a stethoscope to the heart:Phew ! They certainly did a job on him ! Nothing left to look at but chopped meat . God , they did n't leave enough of him for a good P.M. ! Rises , takes pad and pencil from his pocket , glances at MULLIGAN 's shield , writes:Mulligan 10417 19th Precinct . Have you got his pedigree ? MULLIGAN reading from his own notebook:Joe Martin . 28 . White U.S. 5 ft. , 9 in. 170 lbs . Unmarried . Occupation Shrugs his shoulders . INTERN All right . Dr. Flint . Mark him D.O.A. ! MULLIGAN writing:Dead on arrival . Enter , pushing their way through the crowd , the MEDICAL EXAMINER , followed by the POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER . The PHOTOGRAPHER opens his camera , adjusts it , and photographs the body from several angles . INTERN as the EXAMINER approaches:Hello , Doc ! p. 133 MEDICAL EXAMINER Hello , Doctor . So they finally got him , did they ? INTERN Yes , they sure did . MEDICAL EXAMINER It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INTERN Twelve gunshot wounds . Five belly , four chest , three head . Picks up his bag and goes . The EXAMINER inspects the body . MULLIGAN to the DOORMAN:Hey , find something to cover this up with . The DOORMAN nods and disappears through the gateway . MULLIGAN turns to the THIRD POLICEMAN , who is still holding back the crowd.Hey , Tom ! Stand by while I go through this bum ! He kneels and goes through MARTIN 's pockets , handing his findings to the THIRD POLICEMAN who jots them down in his notebook . MULLIGAN takes a ring off MARTIN 's finger.Diamond ring . Look at that rock ! He hands it to the THIRD POLICEMAN , who pockets it and makes a note . MULLIGAN extracts MARTIN 's wad of bills.And this roll of bills ! What a pile ! You count it ! MEDICAL EXAMINER Through with him , boys ? MULLIGAN rising:Yeah . PHOTOGRAPHER One second ! Takes a last photograph . p. 134 MEDICAL EXAMINER Well , as soon as the wagon comes , send him down to the morgue . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you report to me there first thing in the morning , too . MULLIGAN Yes , sir . The EXAMINER goes . The PHOTOGRAPHER folds his camera and follows . WOMAN IN THE CROWD to the SECOND POLICEMAN , who is holding SPIT:Officer ! What did this boy have to do with it ? Why are you holding him ? SECOND POLICEMAN Never mind . Stand back ! SPIT Lemme go ! I did n't do nuttin ' ! Whadda yuh want ?

It wuz a kid named Tommy McGrath . The murmur of the crowd fades as they all listen . MULLIGAN Tommy McGrath ! Where does he live ? SPIT On Foist Avenoo between Fifty-toid and Fifty-fawt . MULLIGAN Sure ? SPIT Yeah . MULLIGAN to the SECOND POLICEMAN:Take this kid around there , will yuh ? Get ahold a Tommy McGrath . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the morgue wagon . p. 135 SECOND POLICEMAN O.K. Drags SPIT through the crowd.Come on ! You show us where he lives and we 'll let you go . As they go off , the murmur of the crowd rises again . The THIRD G-MAN crosses to GIMPTY , who is leaning against the hopper , white and shaking . The DOORMAN comes out with an old discarded coat , the gold braid ravelled and rusty , the cloth dirty and oil-stained . MULLIGAN takes it from him . THIRD G-MAN to GIMPTY:Good work , Mac . Come over to the office and pick up your check . He makes his way up the street . MULLIGAN throws the coat over MARTIN 's body . The murmur of the crowd rises high . A boat horn in the river bellows hoarsely and dies away. @x The same scene . That night . A very dark night . From the dock , the sounds of a gay party , music , babble , laughter . GIMPTY , a bent silhouette , sits on the coping , leaning against the terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lights from the tenement windows are faint and yellow and glum . The lanterns on the gateposts , one red , one green , are lit and look very decorative . There 's a blaze of fire crackling out of an old iron ash can in the center of the street . The boys hover over it , roasting potatoes skewered on long sticks . Their impish faces gleam red one minute and are wiped by shadows the next as they lean over the flames . ANGEL gesturing wildly:All uv a sudden da shots come bing bing bam biff T. B. superior:I hoid da shots foist . I wuz jus walkin ' up ANGEL angrily:Yuh di'not . T. B. I did so .

He retires to sit again in the shadows . DOORMAN If you kids do n't beat it , I 'm going to call a cop ! Turns to the gate .

DRINA comes down the street , sees the boys and hurries to them . MILTY SCHWARTZ Hello , Drina . DRINA MCGRATH Did you see Tommy ? There is a tired , desperate quality in her tone . p. 146 MILTY SCHWARTZ No . DRINA MCGRATH to DIPPY:Did you ? DIPPY Nope . DRINA MCGRATH Did anybody see him ? He has n't been home at all . MILTY SCHWARTZ No . Nobody saw ' im , Drina . DRINA MCGRATH tired , very tired:Thanks . Thanks , Milty . She notices GIMPTY and approaches him . ANGEL in a whisper:Why n't yuh tell huh ?

ANGEL watches him for a while , puzzled , then fishes his kazoo from a pocket , relaxes by the fireside , and hums into the instrument . A shadow detaches itself from the hopper and creeps stealthily toward ANGEL . It whispers " Psst ! Hey ! Angel ! " ANGEL wheels around , startled . p. 149 ANGEL Tommy ! Gese ! TOMMY MCGRATH his face glowing red as he leans over the fire toward ANGEL:Sh ! Shat ap ! In a hoarse whisper.Wheah ah da guys ? They both talk in whispers . ANGEL Dey went tuh look fuh wood .

TOMMY MCGRATH Aw right . Jus ' do like I tole yuh . ANGEL Whadda yuh gon na do tuh Spit if ' ee done it ? TOMMY takes a knife from his pocket and nips open the blade . The firelight runs along the blade . It looks bright and sharp and hard . TOMMY grimly draws it diagonally across his cheek . ANGEL grunts.Mark a de squealuh ? TOMMY MCGRATH snaps the blade home and pockets the knife:Right . ANGEL Gese ! TOMMY MCGRATH Now , go on playin ' yuh kazoo like nuttin ' happened like I wuz n't heah . Footsteps and voices from the gate . TOMMY ducks and melts into the shadows of the hopper . ANGEL plays his kazoo a bit ostentatiously . The DOORMAN opens the gate . KAY appears in a shimmering evening gown , lovely and scented . GIMPTY his voice dull and tired:Hello , Kay ! KAY MITCHELL Hello , Pete ! GIMPTY looks past KAY at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? p. 152 DOORMAN Oh no no , ma'am . Excuse me . Exit . GIMPTY I sent you a note this afternoon . Did you get it ? KAY MITCHELL Yes , I was out . I did n't get back till late . I 'm so sorry , Pete . Forgive me . GIMPTY Forget it ! Two couples in evening clothes come down the street . They are all hectic , gay , and a trifle drunk . They greet KAY merrily . She laughs and jests with them , tells them she 'll join them shortly , and in the gate they go . Not , however , without one or two backward glances at GIMPTY . Their chatter , off , ends in a burst of laughter that fades away . KAY turns to GIMPTY . KAY MITCHELL What a brawl that 's turning into ! GIMPTY Yeah . It seems like quite a party . KAY MITCHELL Yes , it is . GIMPTY after a pause , in a voice so low it can scarcely be heard:Kay did you hear what happened here this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting . KAY MITCHELL making talk . Evading:Oh , yes . And we just missed it . It must have been exciting . I 'm p. 153 GIMPTY I did n't miss it . KAY MITCHELL No ? Oh , tell me was it very ? GIMPTY begins to give way to the terror and remorse pent up in him:It was pretty horrible . KAY MITCHELL Oh of course . GIMPTY Horrible ! KAY MITCHELL realizing by his tone that something dreadful lies in all this , she becomes very tender and soothing:Pete , give me your hand . Come here . She leads him to the edge of the wharf.Sit down . Now , what happened ? GIMPTY I 'd rather not talk about it for a minute . KAY MITCHELL If it upsets you , let 's not talk about it at all . GIMPTY Yes , I 've got to but not for a minute . KAY MITCHELL All right . Underneath them , the River plashes against the bulwark . Off , on the yacht , the band is playing a soft , sentimental melody . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . They sit there for a long time , just staring across the river , at its lights , at the factories and signs on the opposite shore , at the bridge with its glittering loops , at the string of ghostly barges silently moving across the river . For a long time . Then she speaks , quietly . p. 154 KAY MITCHELL I love the river at night . It 's beautiful and a bit frightening . GIMPTY stares down at the black water swirling under him . He begins to talk , faster and faster , trying to push back into his unconscious the terror that haunts him , to forget that afternoon if only for a few seconds:It reminds me of something . What is it ? Oh , yeah when I was a kid . In the spring the sudden sun showers used to flood the gutters . The other kids used to race boats down the street . Little boats : straws , matches , lollipop-sticks . I could n't run after them , so I guarded the sewer and caught the boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes , I remember a whirlpool would form . Dirt and oil from the street would break into rainbow colors iridescent . For a moment he does escape.Beautiful , I think a marvel of color out of dirty water . I ca n't take my eyes off it . And suddenly a boat in danger . The terror in him rises again. I try to stop it . Too late ! It shoots into the black hole of the sewer . I used to dream about falling into it myself . The river reminds me of that . Death must be like this like the river at night . There is no comfort in her big enough for his needs . They sit in brooding silence , which is finally interrupted by the DOORMAN 's voice , off . p. 155 DOORMAN Miss Mitchell came out here only a moment ago . Yes , there she is now . The DOORMAN and a SAILOR come out of the gate . SAILOR Miss Mitchell ? KAY MITCHELL Yes ? SAILOR Mr. Hilton says we 're ready to cast off . We 're waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be there in a minute . SAILOR Yes 'm . Exit SAILOR . DOORMAN turns to ANGEL , who is still hovering over the fire:Why do n't you kids beat it ? ANGEL Aw-w ! DOORMAN All right ! I 'll fix you ! He strides off up the street . GIMPTY desperately:Kay , there 's still time . You do n't have to go . KAY MITCHELL finality in her quiet voice:I 'm afraid I do . GIMPTY Listen I knew where Martin was . And I told the police . KAY MITCHELL You ? How did you recognize him ? GIMPTY I used to know him when I was a kid . p. 156 KAY MITCHELL Oh ! GIMPTY I know it was a stinkin ' thing to do . KAY MITCHELL No . It had to be done . GIMPTY There was a reward . KAY MITCHELL Yes , I know . I read about it . That 's a break for you , Pete . You can help your mother now . And you can live decently . GIMPTY How about you ? KAY MITCHELL This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long pause:No . I guess you 're right . KAY MITCHELL How long would it last us ? Perhaps a year , then what ? I 've been through all that . I could n't go through it again . GIMPTY I guess it 's asking too much . KAY MITCHELL softly , trying to make him see the picture realistically , reasonably:It 's not all selfishness , Pete . I 'm thinking of you too . I could do this . I could go and live with you and be happy  --  And she means it .  --  and then when poverty comes and we begin to torture each other , what would happen ? I 'd leave you and go back to Jack . He needs me too , you see . I 'm pretty certain of him . But what would become of you then ? That sounds pretty bitchy , I suppose . p. 157 GIMPTY No no , it 's quite right . I did n't see things as clearly as you did . It 's just that I 've been such a dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't have everything ever . She rises . GIMPTY Of course . KAY MITCHELL Good-bye , darling . GIMPTY rises:Good-bye , Kay . Have a pleasant trip . KAY MITCHELL one sob escaping her:Oh , Pete , forgive me if I 've hurt you . Please forgive me ! GIMPTY Do n't be foolish . You have n't hurt me . It 's funny , but you know , I never honestly expected anything . I did n't . It was really just a whimsy I played on myself . KAY MITCHELL Pete . GIMPTY Yes ? KAY MITCHELL Will you stay here and wave good-bye to me when the boat goes ? GIMPTY Naturally . I expected to . KAY MITCHELL Thanks . She kisses him.Take care of yourself ! She goes quickly . GIMPTY follows her to the gate , standing there , peering through the bars , catching a last glimpse of her . SPIT trots down the street . p. 158 SPIT He wuz n't deah . ANGEL No ? SPIT Nah . Milty 's a lot of bushwah . I tole yuh . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward at the shadows under the hopper . ANGEL Hey , Spit ! SPIT What ? ANGEL Dey wuz a guy heah T.B . appears , dragging an egg crate . T. B. Look what I got ! Whew ! Boy , dat 'll go up like wildfire ! SPIT Babee ! Dat 's good ! ANGEL Yeah ! Dat 's swell ! They smash up the crate by jumping on it . They they tear off the slats and break them across the curb . The noise of the crashing and splintering exhilarates them . They laugh and chatter . DIPPY enters , puffing and grunting , dragging an old discarded automobile seat by a rope . DIPPY proud of his contribution:Hey , yuh t'ink dis 'll boin ? I t'ink it 'll boin , don ' chew ? Boy , like a house afire , I bet . ANGEL Nah , dat 'll stink up da place . DIPPY disappointed:Aw gese , I dragged it a mile . I dragged it fuh five blocks . It wuz way ovuh by Toid Avenoo . The BOYS throw some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great crackling . Tongues of flame shoot up out of the can . The band on the boat plays " Anchors Aweigh ! " There is much laughter and shouting of " Bon Voyage ! " " Have a pleasant trip , " etc. from the party who have disembarked . The bells and the whistles of the boat blow , the engines throb , and the propellers churn the water . GIMPTY stands strained and tense , looking off , through the gate . p. 159 T. B. Hey , look ! Look ! Duh boat ! She 's goin ' like sixty . Babee ! They rush over to the gate . ANGEL Boy , dat 's some boat ! Dat 's a crackerjack . DIPPY Yeah . He imitates the sound of the bells , the foghorn , the engine.Clang , clang ! Oooh ! Ch , ch , ch ! Poo ! Poo ! I 'm a boat ! Look , felluhs ! I 'm a boat . Ch ! Ch ! Ch ! He shuffles around , hands fore and aft . ANGEL points at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves vigorously:Yoo , hoo ! Yoo hoo ! T. B. She ai n't wavin ' at us , yuh dope . SPIT At Gimpty . T. B.

DIPPY Yuh cud cross ' ee ocean in ' at boat , could n't yuh ? ANGEL returns to the fire and pokes around in it . GIMPTY Oh , yeah , I guess you could . p. 160 T. B. A cawse yuh could , yuh dope , anybody knows ' at . SPIT sees ANGEL fishing out a mickey:Hey , watcha doin ' ? ANGEL testing his mickey:My mickey 's done . Dey 're done now , felluhs !

DIPPY If Tommy wuz heah , yuh would n't do dat . SPIT Nuts tuh yew ! Who 's got da salt ? ANGEL takes a small packet of newspaper from his shoe-shine box:Heah , I got it ! The salt is passed around . They eat their mickeys with much smacking of the lips . DIPPY who has gotten the smallest mickey:Ahl git even witcha ! p. 161 SPIT Nuts ! DIPPY Yew wait till yuh ast me tuh do sumpm fuh yew some day . Jus ' wait . See whatcha git ! SPIT spits at DIPPY:Right innee eye ! DIPPY wiping his eye:Ah , yuh louse !

I want dat five bucks . TOMMY runs from behind the hopper , leaps onto SPIT 's back , bearing him to the ground .

MULLIGAN to ANGEL and MILTY , who are back again:How many times have I got ta tell you ! They retreat . GIMPTY Yes , maybe it is . Anyway , I turned him over for my own selfish reasons . And yet the thing I did , Griswald , was nothing compared to what you 're doing . Yeah Martin was a killer , he was bad , he deserved to die , true ! But I knew him when we were kids . He had a lot of fine stuff . He was strong . He had courage . He was a born leader . He even had a sense of fair play . But living in the streets kept making him bad . Then he was sent to reform school . Well , they reformed him all right ! They taught him the ropes . He came out tough and hard and mean , with all the tricks of the trade . p. 175 MR . GRISWALD But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIMPTY I 'm telling you ! That 's what you 're sending this kid to . MR . GRISWALD I 'm afraid there 's no alternative . DRINA MCGRATH Are you so perfect ? Did n't you ever do anything you were sorry for later ? Screams.God ! Did n't anybody ever forgive you for anything ? MR . GRISWALD looks at her in silence for a moment . Then , gently , and sympathetically:Of course . I 'm sorry . I 'm very sorry . Believe me , I 'm not being vindictive . I 'm not punishing him for hurting me . As far as this goes  --  touches his bandaged wrist .  --  I would forgive him gladly . But you must remember that I 'm a father that today he , unprovoked , beat my boy with a stick and stole his watch . There are other boys like mine . They 've got to be protected , too . I feel awfully sorry for you , but your brother belongs in a reformatory . To MULLIGAN.All right , Officer ! He shakes his head and disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair:What ? MULLIGAN All right !

I didn ' say nuttin ' . What 'd I say ? GIMPTY Sh ! Shut up ! He goes to DRINA , who is sobbing her heart out , and puts a protective arm around her:You poor kid ! You poor kid . Stop crying . Stop crying now . DRINA MCGRATH I 'm all right . I 'll be all right in a minute . GIMPTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow morning you meet me right here at half past nine . We 're going downtown . We 're going to get the best lawyer in this city , and we 'll get Tommy free . DRINA MCGRATH But that 'll cost so much ! GIMPTY Do n't worry about that . We 'll get him out . DRINA MCGRATH Do you really think so ? GIMPTY I know so . DRINA MCGRATH Oh , God bless you you 're so She breaks into sobs again . p. 178 GIMPTY Now , now . You go along now and stick by Tommy . DRINA MCGRATH controlling herself:You 've been so awfully good to us , I I hate to ask for anything else , but GIMPTY Sure , what is it ? DRINA MCGRATH I wish you 'd come along with us now . I know if you 're there they would n't dare touch Her voice catches.Tommy ! GIMPTY Me ? I 'm nobody . I ca n't DRINA MCGRATH I wish you would . Please ? GIMPTY softly:All right .

I loined one-two-three , but now I fuhgit . The DOORMAN appears , uncoiling a garden hose . He pushes ANGEL aside , points the nozzle into the can , and releases the stream . The fire hisses , spits , and dies . A thick pillar of smoke ascends skyward out of the can . p. 179 ANGEL looks upward , entranced:Holy smokes ! DIPPY Whee ! ANGEL Look a dat ! T. B. Boy ! Right up tuh duh sky ! ANGEL Right up tuh duh stahs ! DIPPY How high ah dey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate:And you rats better not start any more trouble , if you know what 's good for you !
