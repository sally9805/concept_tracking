Wedding-of-the-Year <P> ( See front cover ) <P> In tiny Christ Church at Christiana Hundred , Del. next week , retired Powder-maker Eugene du Pont will give in marriage his eldest daughter Ethel to Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. , third son and namesake of the U. S. President . To hundreds of thousands of U. S. citizens for whom the Duke &; Duchess of Windsor 's nuptials were more notorious than romantic , the union of Ethel du Pont and Franklin Roosevelt is Wedding-of-the-Year . No two families figure more prominently in the nation 's industrial and political history . And no handsomer couple is likely to exchange vows anywhere on earth this June than the tall ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) , slim , Harvard oarsman and the lissome sportswoman who becomes his bride . But position and pulchritude were not so responsible for the Roosevelt-Du Pont wedding 's capturing public imagination as the fact that it culminated as bang-up a love story as Kathleen Norris ever turned out , complete with secret trysts , irreconcilable families , desperate illnesses and a happy ending . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unanimous interest ( and mixed emotions ) the two divorces and two remarriages ( Anna 's and Elliott 's ) in which the President 's children participated during his first term , became aware in April 1934 that Franklin and Ethel du Pont were companions . The discovery was inescapable because the pair was attending a wrestling match in Philadelphia and Franklin , objecting to being photographed at the ringside , made a flying tackle at the Ledger 's photographer and smashed his camera . " This man was taking a photograph of me , " explained Franklin , " and I do n't like to have my photograph taken . " A member of his family has since revealed that a good part of Franklin 's dislike of being photographed at Philadelphia may well have been due to his anxiety lest another , and at the time steadier , girl friend find out that he was having a date with Ethel . However , Franklin and Ethel were already old friends , having met , they now dimly recall , at a Groton dance several years before . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel Walker School ( Simsbury , Conn . ) . <P> Two months after the Philadelphia wrestling match episode , Franklin was a guest at Ethel 's debut at Owls Nest , the Du Ponts ' Greenville , Del. home . He subsequently visited her there and at a summer place at North Harbor , Me . When they appeared together at other debuts in Boston and Philadelphia the same year , society columnists began to predict a match . " Absolutely untrue , " snapped Father du Pont . Nevertheless , Franklin bought a roadster in Wilmington and gave his address as Owls Nest Road .
