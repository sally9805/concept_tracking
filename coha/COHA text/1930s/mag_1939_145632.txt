The British Interplanetary Society is a group of 100-odd enthusiasts who think a voyage to the moon by rocket-ship could be undertaken right away , if the necessary funds ( about $1,250,000 ) were forthcoming .

It is debatable whether some alcoholic beverage should be permitted to celebrate the landing on the moon but there will in any case be a small amount in the medicine chest . <P> " Culinary processes will be carried out in one electrically heated vessel of some light alloy which will serve as a saucepan for boiling water and frying pan for cooking any meat permitted . Each astronaut will be allowed one cup ( but no saucer ) , one plate and one spoon , and a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hand to hand . . . . <P> " Sanitation of the ship will be accomplished through the medium of an air-lock in which refuse will be deposited . Upon removing the outer cover the air remaining in the lock will drive the refuse away from the ship . . . . <P> " One pack of lightweight cards will while away any tedious hours of the journey . . . .
