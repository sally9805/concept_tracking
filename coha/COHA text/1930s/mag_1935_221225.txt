Because Rubberman Benjamin Franklin Goodrich , sometime physician , had been dead 18 years , no one at B. F. Goodrich Co. realized that a chunky , broad-shouldered young man who reported for work at the Akron factory one day in 1906 was the founder 's nephew . James Dinsmore Tew , just out of Harvard and anxious to prove his worth , did not take the trouble to remind his employers that B. F. Goodrich Co. had once been called Goodrich , Tew &; Co . At the end of two years , when young Tew was making $75 a month , he asked for a raise . " I 'm sorry , Tew , " was the reply , " but I 'm afraid you 've reached your limit . " Presumably unqualified for further advancement in Goodrich , he walked over to Diamond Rubber Co. where he got a better job at a better salary . Four years later Diamond Rubber was merged with Goodrich and young Tew found himself back with his old company . Alert , ambitious , quick-thinking , he was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1928 , became president . Quiet , conservative Mr. Tew kept on living in comparative modesty at nearby Hudson where , always investigating new ways to make rubber , he used to putter with latex on the kitchen stove . <P> Last week publicity-hating President Tew was chagrinned to find his name very much in the news . Two months ago he asked Goodrich stockholders to authorize a $45,000,000 first mortgage , of which $28,000,000 was to be raised immediately , the rest at some indefinite future date . The purpose of the issue was to retire at a cost of $22,000,000 all of Goodrich 's 67 bonds and all of the 5% and 7% notes of Hood Rubber Co. , a Watertown , Mass , subsidiary which manufactures Goodrich footwear as well as products under its own name . All this seemed commonplace enough to Goodrich shareholders . But to Cyrus Stephen Eaton , once-famed Cleveland banker and power tycoon , it became high treason the moment President Tew , in selecting the list of underwriters for the proposed issue , passed over the Cleveland investment house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal partner in Otis &; Co. , which five years ago helped underwrite another Goodrich bond issue . Though Otis was reorganized and considerably deflated after the collapse of the Cleveland banker 's fortunes in 1931 , Eaton still maintains an office at the firm 's Cleveland headquarters and takes a hand in its management . Last May he called on President Tew . Was Otis &; Co. going to get a slice of the new financing ? No , replied Mr. Tew , it was not . Then , said Eaton , he would move heaven &; earth to prevent the plan from going through . <P> Accordingly , last fortnight , Otis &; Co. dispatched a tart letter to most of Goodrich 's 24,000 stockholders .
