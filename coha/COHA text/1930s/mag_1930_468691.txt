THE traveling American is as a rule proud of his country . In spite of some obvious national shortcomings ? and what nation is perfect ? ? he is inclined to be pleased with his country 's evident material prosperity and its unquestioned industrial efficiency ; and , if he is at all human , he derives considerable satisfaction from the envy which these things have aroused in others . If he is of open mind he will admit that America may be deficient in some of the refinements of life , but it would never occur to him that he might see his flag ten thousand miles from home and be ashamed . Yet it is just this shock which lies in store for the observant American who visits the Philippines . For , on landing in Manila ? if he lands without prejudice or preconceived idea ? he finds that in the eyes of more than half the world we are making an exhibition of ourselves which would never for an instant be tolerated at home . If he has in the past dismissed the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds after only a few days in Manila that he no longer so easily dismisses them . For he discovers that conditions exist there which are at present nothing short of scandalous , which may have far-reaching implications for his country , and about which nothing whatever is being done . In order to understand the many implications of our tenure of the Philippines it is necessary , first of all , to clear one 's mind of certain " imperialist " and " anti-imperialist " notions which mayhave been sound enough in Kipling 's prime or when Bryan ran for President but which are quite useless now . The era of the expansion of powers of the temperate zone into the tropics is practically over , and this makes a discussion of the rights and wrongs of our acquisition of the Philippines extremely academic . It can safely be set down , however , that this expansion , commonly called " imperialism , " does not depend so much on the Kiplingesque motive of giving the brown brother a lot of moral improvement which he does not want as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , and all European countries , needs large quantities of goods ? notably raw materials ? which can not be obtained at home . She also needs markets . Neither goods nor markets are to be had unless law and order exist and , once these are established , railroads and irrigation works can he built which will further increase both the supply of goods and the purchasing power of the market , and will yield a profit in and of themselves . It seems wholly unnecessary to conceal these highly intelligent motives beneath the Kipling idea of bringing holiness into wild places . No less superfluous are the declarations of the so-called " anti-imperialists " about the immemorial rights of man ; for such declarations run in the face of all the facts . The tropical man ? of which the Malay is one ? is about the clearest example the world affords of the influence of environment on human beings . Nature does practically everything for him : she gives him food , clothing , and shelter for next to nothing ; and the climate makes it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inclination is to do practically nothing . He makes a fetish of passivity . We , whose fetish is activity , would probably react in the same way if our ancestors had lived in the tropics . But our ancestors originated in the bleak north of Europe , where the beast had to be hunted and killed to provide clothes , the tree felled to get shelter , and the hard , ungrateful ground laboriously tilled to get food . We learned to combat and overcome nature and developed a fierce joy in so doing which has led to our present complex material civilization . The result is that when the Northern man , with his taste for doing and overcoming , comes into contact with the tropical man , with his taste for submitting and enduring , the tropical man always submits . To rail against this purely natural phenomenon and to talk about right and wrong in connection with it is as fruitless as to rail against the changes in the seasons . It should be accepted as a fact , and programs for change should be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as this article is concerned , the fact narrows down to the Philippines ? an archipelago of some three thousand islands extending north and south about as far as Maine is from Florida , whose capital is three days ' steam from China , four or five days away from Singapore and Java , and whose northernmost islands are about forty miles away from the southernmost islands of the Japanese Empire . This archipelago has a population of some eleven million people , predominantly of the Malay race . The Malay , to complete the setting of the stage , was called by the Spaniards the " brother of the water buffalo . " The water buffalo , or carabao , enjoys sitting in one place : the Malay has always put up with tyranny and brutality because these are so much less trouble than toshow an active interest in his own destiny . Long ago he was ruled by petty princes . Then came the Spaniards , who substituted their tyranny for his . And thirty years ago , by a strange turn of the wheel , the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonizing power , though in our case there was scant practical justification for it because , unlike Britain or Holland , we not only did not need many kinds of raw materials ? the disposal of our own was a serious problem . H As one goes round the world from New York eastward , the word " tyranny " seems less and less objectionable to the people one encounters . When one gets half way around the world ? to the Philippines ? it actually seems mild ; for many Orientals , responding to an immemorial tradition , regard tyranny as an essential attribute of government . In the tropics this view is held all the more strongly because a tyrant 's government , requiring no civic mental effort on the part of the governed , is appropriate to indolent people . To be sure , the Oriental tyrant can be deposed if he goes too far , but another tyrant is then set up in his place . This fundamental of government is joined to another which is still a strong factor in the East ? that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social organization on a national scale . The idea of nationality has appealed to us in the West because it is essential to us . Living in relatively barren places and having insatiable appetites for things we could not get where we lived , we have been compelled to look far afield to satisfy our wants and exchange the goods of one section with those of another . Nationalism , or government on a scale broad enough to include these activities , is a natural and meritorious result . The tropical Malay , however , wears next to nothing , lives on a frugal diet of astonishing monotony , and shelters himself from the sun and rain with plants that grow without any help from him . Everything he needs he finds almost in his back yard . Why should he build roads , why should he think corporately , why should he look beyond ? And why should we be surprised , as we always are , that he does not do these things ? This local point of view feeling , which is stronger than we Westerners can conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for children , and the motto is , " We look after ours ; you look after yours . " The Malay thinks locally , as his circumstances require , and locally he is a success . So it is that although the inhabitants of the Philippines are of the Malay race and brown-skinned , this subdivision into small communities has created differences ? and allowed virginal differences to subsist ? which are as great as the difference between the white-skinned Englishman and the white-skinned Bulgar . Perhaps greater , because in addition to differences in features and language ( there are eighty-seven Philippine tongues ) , there are fundamental differences in religion which add to the hardship of forcing these peoples to have intercourse with one another . In European countries there are still racial differences between the citizens of the same state , witness the Breton and Gascon of France and the Prussian and Bavarian of Germany . We Americans , however , in addition to loathing tyranny and exalting nationalism , have no such long-standing , aboriginal divisions to enable us to understand the divisions of others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenth century they found a host of small and unrelated communities ruled by petty princes , rajahs , and headmen . The Spaniards did not destroy this system but used it and governed by means of it In the early days of American military government the system was not much interfered with . The great change came under American civil government , when the attempt was made to transform a sprawling archipelago of tropical , Oriental islands into a centralized nation on the Western , twentieth-century plan ; in other words , to impose the nationalist ideal upon a group of peoples having no need for it . Development along this line went on rapidly until , under the administration of Governor General W. Cameron Forbes , a noteworthy degree of centralization had been reached . By 1912 the American government of the Philippines was something positive . Although it rested on the highly unsound assumption that what was good for us was good for the Malays , it was in its own American way efficient . A remarkably able American civil service was in charge and was achieving results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then in 1916 a Democratic Congress , frankly desirous of getting rid of the islands but lacking the courage to do so , passed the Jones act , thus completely changing the situation . This law was written by a man who had little knowledge of colonial problems and it was based upon the political axiom that everything which one American party has done is ipso facto wrong and should be changed by the other . This law inaugurated the system of American responsibility without authority under which the Philippines have been administered ever since . It seems to justify the statement that while the Spaniards killed the Filipinos with cruelty , we are reducing them to nothingness with kindness . Instead of allowing the plain facts to modify our first judgment , we have since 1916 assumed more strongly than ever that the Filipino is exactly the same as we are . We should have satisfied the requirements of democracy if we had assumed that they were our equals . But we declared that the tropical , village brown man was just like the Northern , national white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not mean what we said . In fact we showed that we were actually less democratic than the Spaniards , for they married the Filipino and gave the offspring a distinct social position . With the customary low-grade exceptions , Americans do not marry Filipinos but maintain a separate social life . Under the Jones act we set up our own triple-branch , water-tight-compartment system of government ? with a Senate , a House , a Judiciary and an Executive ? and banded it over to the Filipinos . Our system is difficult enough for us to operate ; it would be wholly unworkable in most of the highly civilized , politically educated European countries ; and the result with the politically ignorant Filipinos is not hard to imagine . We complicated our own system further by placing an American at the head as Governor General who is not responsible to the Filipinos and receives only spasmodic backing from his own country . The American Governor General of the Philippine Islands is one of the most hopeless creations in the whole of governmental history . He is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that capacity is supposed to be supreme . At the same time he is at the head of a government of Filipinos , and in that capacity he can appoint no one to public office without the consent of the Filipino legislature . He is thus a complete contradiction in terms . Only a genius could get positive results from such a system . The late Leonard Wood was just such a genius , but he was also mortal , and his labors killed him . The administration of his successor , Mr. Henry L. Stimson , shows why men of ability are no longer considering it a tempting honor to be offered the post of Governor General . Mr. Stimson attempted to strengthen the islands by giving legislative aid to the development of their economic resources ? one of the most important problems in the islands to-day . He got some of the legislation be desired ? as much of it as could be repealed at once without any permanent changes having been effected . When it came to a bill to change the present system of restricted land holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was defeated . In return for these rather illusory victories he was obliged to make concessions involving a disheartening weakening of what little American prestige there was left . Under this system of governmental stagnation less than one per cent of the American civil servants have remained . Public health , which is such a vital matter in the disease-ridden tropics , can no longer be discussed because there are no longer accurate figures . The educational policy has had the result of filling an agricultural country with quantities of young men who refuse to engage in agriculture , their American education having taught them that white-collar jobs are the only proper ones . Instead , they head for the law in a country too poor for extensive litigation . Mr. Stimson himself has said that in a recent year the number of applicants for bar examinations in Manila would have excited comment in New York . There being not enough legal work to go around , these young men have gone into the most profitable occupation in most poor countries ? politics . We not only try to implant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implant also our law and our language . If the Americans going to the islands went via Suez and thus noted the experiences of others , instead of going via San Francisco , we might not be repeating the mistakes which other colonizing powers have made and have now ceased to make . We might , for instance , have seen what the Dutch are doing in Java , and emulated them . The Dutch have been in Java for three hundred years and have discovered that the Malay has his own ideas of right and wrong , which may seem strange to us , but probably no stranger than our ideas seem to him . The Dutch did not force OUR FAILURE IN their law on their peoples . Instead , they studied the Malay customary law , codified it , and learned to live by it . The Malay has confidence in his own law ; he understands and respects it . In certain sections of the Philippines , on the other hand , a year may go by without a civil case coming to court . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , is apt to fee ! that " pull " is all which counts in our courts and prefers to settle outside . The same thing holds true of language . We did not remember that in medieval Europe Latin was the language of the school and that English , French , and German were the language of the home . We are trying to make the Philippines into an English-speaking nation ; but in the homes " regal , Visayan , and the other native dialects are spoken , lending color to the belief that English will always be as infrequently spoken in the islands as Latin is in the Western world . The language of the home is the language which survives . The Dutch have realized this and do not seek to impose their language on the native . If our American officials had stopped at Batavia and Singapore on their way out , they might have received some even more fundamental notions . They might have seen the way in which the Dutch , for instance , who are the most dispassionate and scientific of colonizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete consideration of this most interesting question here . It is enough to say that the Dutch , after first encouraging the creation of the half-caste , later reached the conclusion ( which is now generally shared ) that he is an unfortunate creature , unfit for the great responsibility of government and unfit for the plain life of the native . We , on the other hand , have made the latest chapter of Philippine history the glorification of this inglorious creature in the civic sense , although socially we do not accept him The Filipino half-caste or " mestizo " lives in the towns . He is glib , he can make phrases the meaning THE PHILIPPINES ' 213 of which he himself sometimes does not comprehend . He has little less than hate for the white man and contempt for the pure-blooded native . Yet when we turned over the government to the natives the " mestizo " was the only class literate enough to govern . So it is that we abdicated our power in favor of this creature , and so it is that Philippine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the native was governed respectively by native chieftains , Spaniards , Americans , and now the halfcastes ? in the name of local self-government and under the American flag ! Although we pay lip service to local self-government , the half-caste , or his henchman , is in control throughout the villages off the islands . We can not blame him if he practices ignoble extortions in Filipino villages ? if he perpetuates , for instance , the custom of the village headman spending the first night with each newly married bride . Such is his nature . We can not blame anyone but ourselves if we have put the American Governor General in such a position that he can get nothing done without licking the boots of such persons . It is our fault and only ours if so distinguished a critic as Professor Ralston Hayden can say , " With the cooperation of an American Governor General and the approbation of an American President , the Philippines obtained practically complete autonomy under a system of government which had never been authorized or even dreamed of by Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many promises to the Filipinos ? many of which we have broken . The last expression of the American people through Congress on the Philippines was in 1916 , when we pledged ourselves to fit them for independence . It seems idle to say that Congress had no right to make such a promise ; for the pledge was taken as such by the Philippines and the world in general . Woodrow Wilson spoke truly when he said in 1907 : We can give the Filipinos constitutional government , a government which they may count upon to he just , a government based upon some clear understanding , intended for their good and not for our aggrandizement ; but we must for the present supply that government . But we can not give them selfgovernment . Self-government is not a thing which can be " given " to any people , because it is a form of character and not of constitution . No people can be " given " the selfcontrol of maturity . . . To ignore these fundamental things would be not only to fail and fail miserably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , if the Philippines are to attain independence and stand alone they must have strength in and of themselves . In the words of the old adage , they must be made healthy , wealthy , and wise . We can not make them wise , educate them as we will . We have made them healthy , although since the Filipinization of the government it is impossible to tell whether that health has been maintained . Wealth lies within our grasp and within the sphere of our responsibility ? and wealth is power , and power is independence . The wealth of the islands , like that of all tropical countries , lies in the production of those raw materials ? rubber , sugar , camphor , etc. ? which we of the North import in such huge quantities . The Philippines are potentially capable of producing such raw materials in imposing quantities , but in order to do so they need capital . In spite of the fact that we need many of the materials which the Philippines could produce and in spite of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , capital has not been forthcoming . Here again because of the apathy of the American people , as this is represented by Congress , American capital hesitates to enter the Philippines . No one knows how long the islands are to be under our flag , and so long as the political futureof the islands is so uncertain what sensible man would invest there ? The laws governing capital in the Philippines and the laws restricting the ownership of land also make development extremely difficult . The Dutch , again , have a system of hind laws which facilitates development and protects the natives from ruthless exploitation . But we refuse to learn from the Dutch . Congress could change this condition and so fulfill part of its promise to fit the Filipinos for independence by making them economically strong . Nothing except the overwhelming indifference of the American people stops it from repealing the preamble to the Jones law ( to which the political uncertainty is due ) and from enacting modern land laws . Given this policy of neglect , who can be surprised that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberia , another to Brazil , and still another to the Dutch East Indies ? In spite of the fact that the Philippines could produce rubber , American business men do not dare to do business under the American flag . Look at the economic question from another angle ? public revenues . The annual revenues and public expenditures in the small Japanese possession of Formosa were in a recent year greater than those in the entire Philippine archipelago . in our Philippines the revenues have been about the same for the past three years . Yet the population is growing and , thanks to the American tenure , so are their wants . These wants can not he satisfied in so poor a country ; and this is one reason why the Philippine immigration to California is assuming noteworthy proportions . The only positive economic fact seems to be that because of us and their freetrade connection with us , their standard ? and hence their cost ? of living has gone up far beyond that of any of their neighbors . The point has now been reached where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a land OUR FAILURE IN which is economically unable to support them . It is like putting a Rolls-Royce body on a Ford chassis . At present they can trade with us because they are exempt from the tariff . If they were cut loose from us they would be unable to compete with Java , British Malaya , or Indo China , where living standards are roughly only a tenth as high . We have weakened them to such a point that independence would be the most wanton cruelty . A concluding instance of what happens in the islands regardless of the nobility of our intentions is afforded by the Chinese , who are hated and feared by the Malays because when Chinese meets Malay , the Malay always comes out second best . In British Malaya , for instance , Chinese were admitted . To-day it is estimated that half the population of what was once a pure Malay region is Chinese . No wonder the Malay is glad to have the protection of the white man where the Chinese are concerned ! We have an exclusion act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement is so lax and incompetent that to-day roughly eighty per cent of the retail trade and about fifty per cent of the wholesale import trade is in their hands . They can work harder and more cheaply than the lazy native . The result must either be a pogrom of Chinese or the recession of the Malay . So it is that during 1928 and the first two months of 1929 an average of 2,120 Filipinos left every month for Hawaii and the United States , while Chinese were easily bootlegged into any one of the thousands of Philippine islands and started to breed the native out of existence . What can one say about this in the face of our responsibility to protect them ? When asked this question , Americans in the islands admitted that Chinese were entering and were conquering ? not with guns and warships , but with their ability to intermarry . Theft admitted that we had not strengtlined but weakened the economic condition of the Philippines . But they said that our intentions were good , that our policy was humane . With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobler than those of the Dutch or the British or the French . But in their possessions the emphasis is placed on the day-by-day , efficient execution of their policies , such as they are . We place our emphasis on spectacular enunciation . That is why there is the same difference between the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies as there is between a neglected charitable institution and an establishment efficiently run for mutual profit . IV If , then , we are doing the islands more harm than good , the next question is : what good , if any , do they do us ? It seems scarcely deniable that at the present time they arc beneficial to us in only the most insignificant ways . They are too poor to be an important market for our manufactured goods or for our raw materials . They are so undeveloped that they can not supply us with the tropical raw materials which we buy in such enormous quantities from others . Potentially they could become both a market for our goods and a source of supply for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing largely to the fear that the islands might produce enough to endanger domestic producers , the chief interest Congress has taken in the islands has been unfriendly . Whoever expects Congress to take the few necessary steps for making the islands useful to us is taking a great deal for granted . It is frequently said that the islands are useful to us because of their nearness to the Chinese market , which , some persons say , will some day grow into an enormously rich one of great importance to our national prosperity . This , too , is uncertain ; and there are plenty of students of the Orient who predict that China can never become an important consumer of American goods . The optimists , however , hold that it soon will and that the Philippines will be invaluable to us as a trading post . If this day does come we could , to be sure , use an international port like Shanghai or a British port like Hong Kong , not to mention the Chinese ports themselves , all of which are nearer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from south China and a week away from Shanghai . But one is told that in case of war we should be " shut out of the East " without Manila ? that China would be " encircled " by the British , French , Dutch , and Japanese , and that our commerce could not get in . This picture of an **26;919;TOOLONG alliance against us may to some seem fanciful . But even assuming that it is extremely likely , the sad fact is that with the Philippines we are in a weaker military position than we should be without them . Our naval force in Asiatic waters could be swept off the seas by the Japanese and our military forces in the islands could not withstand a determined attack by a neighboring power . While there seems to be slight possibility of a major war in the Far East , those who defend retention of the Philippines base their argument on that possibility , and for that reason it should be considered . Our naval establishment in Asiatic waters consists of one old cruiser , twenty destroyers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squadrons , a few auxiliary vessels , and ten gunboats , principally for police work against Chinese pirates . Honolulu , the nearest completely equipped base , is six thousand miles away . Any fleet equipped with capital ships and supported by neighboring bases could wipe our naval force off the seas in short order or send it scurrying to cover . Our force in the East might have a momentary harassing value . It might , like the " suicide squads " of the Great War , delay the enemy advance , but that would be all . Moreover two years would probably elapse before the United States fleet could function in Far Eastern waters with an adequate train and control force , that is to say with a force capable of supplying the fleet and of protecting effectively the long line of communication . The Army garrison , centered for the most part about Manila , consists of about ten thousand troops , most of whom are native . Their loyalty to us is not doubted ; but neither was that of the native Indian troops before the Sepoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-supported landing force could defeat these troops and seize the great northern island of Luzon . At the entrance of Manila Bay is the island of Corregidor which is so heavily fortified that it is known as the " Gibraltar of the East . " Military men have been fond of saying that , regardless of what happened , the garrison at Corregidor could hold out for a long time , as its gun fire would control any sea approach to Manila . But aviation has altered this dictum as it has altered many . Under the terms of the Washington Treaty gas-proof chambers can not be built on Corregidor ; and no one knows how long it could endure . But would not its very endurance create that wave of sympathy which would impel the American people to hold the Philippines at all costs ? Can one not imagine the demand for the relief of the heroic little garrison ? The Philippines , far from home and inadequately defended , are clearly the weakest link in our chain of national defense . Being the tender spot in our armor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aimed . The result would inevitably be that we should lose the Philippines if any vigorous power wished to take it . Once our naval and military forces had been swamped , two courses would be left open to us . One would be to surrender the islands , with a view to defeating the enemy in a theater more suited to our strategic needs . The other would be to pitch right in and fight for them on the spot . The excitability of the American temperament in time of war lends color to the belief that we would demand their recovery at once and make it politically impossible for any President or for any War Department to do otherwise . The result would be the sending of an expeditionary force to the islands , which we are entirely unequipped to do both from the standpoint of men and materiel . The picture of young American men , dying from tropical diseases , in a wilderness twelve thousand miles away , for a possession of questionable value to their country is not a pleasant one . V Three salient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent . In the first place , we are doing the Filipinos more harm than good . Second , the Philippines at present do us more harm than good . Finally , there is virtually no prospect that Congress will take the few easy steps to strengthen the hands of American authority in the islands and make their economic development a likely prospect . What courses , then , are open to us ? The answer to this question is as simple as the problem is complicated . It lies ready-made for us in the message of Theodore Roosevelt to the British on their occupation of Egypt ? govern or get out . If we were to follow this maxim and compel Congress to translate it into action , the abuses which are now taking place under our flag would cease , and the islands would become a source of profit to us and to the Filipinos . If we persist in doing nothing it would be better for ourselves , for the Filipinos , and for the world in general for us to get out . But this , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an easy thing to do . We can not give them independence because independence can not be given ; it must be attained . Ifwe were to cut them loose , as the late William J. Bryan suggested , they would speedily fall under the domination of a foreign financial protectorate . One can say this with some certainty ; for when the Wilson policy of leaving them strictly alone was in force and the American Governor General purposely made himself into a figurehead , the Filipino politicians did not take long to come within an ace of bankrupting the government . ? It is suggested that we grant them independence and guarantee that independence by a treaty with the other great powers . Apart from the historical lesson that nations which can not stand by themselves do not stand at all , it should be realized that with such an arrangement the United States would be regarded as primarily responsible for protecting the islands , the other powers merely agreeing not to harm them . We should thus be in somewhat the same position of responsibility without authority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should have no military establishment quartered in the islands and should have even less authority than we have at the present time . There is , besides , the constitutional point that Congress can not alienate American territory . The Philippines were not acquired by Congress , but by international treaty . There are eminent constitutional lawyers who have studied the point and who say that we can get rid of the islands only in the same way . This , and the manifest impracticality of " giving them independence , " suggests turning them over to another power better equipped to govern them than are we . If we are to get rid of them , this seems like an intelligent method worthy of careful consideration . Both the outright method of cutting them loose and the guaranteeing of their independence by international treaty would be extremely disturbing to the Far Eastern situation , which is not very stable anyway . Moreover , the best experience through several centuries shows that the Malay , lovable as he is , is incapable of protecting himself . Throughout the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be overrun by his neighbors . If we were to decide on this course the British or the Dutch or the French immediately suggest themselves as peoples with a broad experience in colonial government and won over to the humane view of colonial responsibility . But , as matters now stand , it is doubtful whether they would care to enlarge their imperial responsibilities . The sale of the islands to another Far Eastern power , were it to Russia or to Japan , would probably have a disquieting effect on the Western nations now in the Pacific . If Russia were to have the islands , Japan and China would raise loud cries , and the rest of the world could only view with apprehension the installation of such a power in a position which offers such good oppportunities for troublemaking . The sale of the islands to Japan would have a most disquieting effect on the Australians , who live in a state of perennial nervousness about Japan . It would also alarm the Dutch , who are unable to defend their own possessions without outside assistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poke one part of it and it all shakes . Whoever speculates on this problem ? and it must be speculation , for on this as on any other Philippine question , the United States has taken no important step ? must naturally think of Germany , a nation with colonizing experience and with a surplus population ready to brave the risks of a new and distant land . Forsome years enlightened opinion in the Allied countries has held that it would be a good thing for the peace of Europe if Germany had colonies . Putting it bluntly , this opinion has taken the view that if there were fewer Germans in Europe the chances for peace would be greater . The presence of another Teutonic power in the Far East would probably be a pacifying factor as far as the general situation is concerned . It would ensure efficiency in the government of the Philippines and a realization of their great economic possibilities . Perhaps they could be sold at a nominal price with a pledge for eventual independence and the open door for the commerce of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for profitable investment ? both for native and for foreigner ? which they certainly are not to-day . After the blood we have shed and the patriotic and distinguished service of individual Americans in the islands , it would be a painful thing for any American to see such a transfer occur . But such a transfer would be more honest and more high-principled than our present policy of allowing the islands to drift aimlessly along on a sea of false hopes and unkept pledges . Such an act on our part might be regarded by the rest of the world as a confession of our inability ? or , at the very best , our unwillingness ? to cope with a problem which we had pledged our faith to solve . But such au interpretation , however unpalatable to us , would be merely the truth . In other words , if the facts are faced honestly , this seems to be our choice : to do the job well ourselves or let someone else do it as it should be done .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
