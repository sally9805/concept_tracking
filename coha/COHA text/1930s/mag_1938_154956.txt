THE JOURNEY UP-Robert Hichens- Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> As ONCE YOU WERE-A . S. M. Hutchinson-Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> Robert Hichens ' The Garden of Allah , published in 1904 , when he was 40 , has sold about a million copies . Arthur Stuart Menteth Hutchinson 's If Winter Comes , published in 1921 , when he was 42 , sold 558,649 copies in the U. S. alone . Last week their latest novels ( Hichens ' 36th , Hutchinson 's tenth ) served chiefly as reminders that these once tremendously popular novelists were still alive . They also served as reminders that best-selling novels , while still frequently inexplicable , now show a big improvement over those of the last generation . <P> But above all , Hichens and Hutchinson last week bore witness to the long lives of second-rate writers . For the fluent second-rate writer works regular hours , takes care of himself , makes good investments , usually writes one best-seller and at last acquires a kind of momentum which enables him to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Neither better nor worse than Hichens ' average two-a-year , The Journey Up is the snob story of a mannequin whose social ambitions make a moral and financial wreck of her surgeon-husband . It is a good example of nearly automatic writing . Its only discernible purpose is to keep Author Hichens ' income at about $25,000 a year and enable him to lead the comfortable cosmopolitan bachelor existence to which he has become accustomed . <P> Only the momentum of his best-seller reputation keeps Author Hutchinson going . As Once You Were , the story of a middle-aged writer named Piers Exceat who retires to a small island-estate to re-live a sort of Boy Scout boyhood , makes Author Hutchinson 's If Winter Comes seem in retrospect like hard-hammered realism . Not only has his sentimentality aged terribly but even his style has become wrinkled and chapfallen.
