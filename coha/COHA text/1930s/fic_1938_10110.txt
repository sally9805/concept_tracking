' Nam suh , we did n't wants to wakes you all up . Matt sont Jim out , quick 's he got up dis mawnin ' , to bring one in , an ' here ' t is , ' he added , holding the bird , stripped of its clay covering , up to view . As they ate , they could hear the drivers gathered some distanceaway around their own campfire , talking and laughing , and the hobbled mules munching their way through the rustling grass . Around them , small , brilliantly colored birds rose on fluttering wings from the thick-matted blackberry bushes that followed the creek 's course a little distance away . Redbirds and wild canaries , ' Cavin told Lucina , pointing them out to her , and see that dull , gray bird amongst them ? You never saw anything in your life fly so high as that little bird , ' he laughed . We 've another hinny bird here  --  no bigger'n a minute , but it 'll tackle a hawk and get the best of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch ' em fight through Pa 's field glasses . ' There are all kinds of snakes and ants and spiders and scorpions and things I ought to show you , besides , ' he said , eagerly drawing on his pleasant boyhood memories , unconscious of her shrinking . Come on , ' he said , rising briskly and pulling her up beside him . Let 's go take a walk while Matt 's hitching up . ' He stood still , eyeing her with a gleam of amusement in his lively eyes . Bet you never saw a sensitive plant that folds up if you touch it , or a plant that cats flies ? Or a tree whose bark 'll cure your toothache ? Or '  --  he grinned  --  a cactus that grows pears and nuts on it ? ' For an hour they walked along the creek bed , resting here and there on fallen logs , while they watched vultures circling and dipping , under a sky so wide and blue that it was almost black . Look ! ' said Cavin , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Here 's one o ' the plants I was telling you about . ' It grew on a damp spot sloping down to the creek , its pansylikered blossom studded thickly with tiny hairs tipped with drops of sticky dew . Moving closer , Cavin dropped his finger in its centre , and the petals curled quickly around it . Gosh ! It has a grip , ' he cried , as delighted with its behavior as when he first had tested out its curious , tensile strength . Watch it ; it 'll let go in a minute , soon as it finds out I 'm not a fly . ' Does it hurt ? ' she asked , watching the leaves unfold . Oh , no , ' he answered ; try it . ' But when she did , her delicate skin turned fiery red and burned as though it had been blistered . You have to get used to this country . I see that , ' she told him , as they returned to camp . Even the flowers bite you ! ' Ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt in the front driver 's seat . Cavin tucked Lucina 's hand inside his arm and hurried toward the teams . The rest of the way is pretty tough going , as I remember it , ' he said . You just have to cut across the prairie , and hope you do n't run into a bog hole . Wish I had some boots . ' With a lugubrious grin , he held out his foot for I , eee ilea to look at . Imagine what 'll happen to those contraptions if we strike deep mud ! ' Uncle Matt had been worrying about the same contingency . Sometimes , he meditated , Mas ' Philip sent into town for a soft pair of new boots , hand sewed and turned boots finely traced in red , with tops as pliable as silk , and heels as red as the tracery . Lawd Jesus ! Would n't it he just right , now , if there happened to be a pair like that in the wagon ? Maybe Mas ' Gavin could wear his pa 's boots ! Patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last he came upon what he was searching for . Then , raising himself with an expression of absolute felicity on his black face , he laid the boots out in Cavin 's wagon . My Gosh-amighty ! ' Cavin exclaimed , when he saw them . Talk about answers to prayer ! ' With a little padding in the toes , they fitted fairly well , and all afternoon he lay back in the wagon , lifting his foot from time to time to gaze , like a child , at his brand-new boots . They had not yet reached the part of the route that was hard going , so he had little to do but rest and call Lucina 's attention to things she should notice as they moved slowly along across the monotonousplain . Toward evening , the whole prairie began again to reflect the shifting tints of the sky ; and suddenly the yellow crimson light passed into a quick and settling dark . A little later , as they sat under the pines waiting for supper , the moon rose , a golden disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate their boiled eggs , and their yarns baked in ashes by its light , with the glow from the fire playing over them . Cavin 's hand groped Ibr Lucina 's . I do n't want a thing in this world , do you ? ' She laughed softly . I ca n't think of a thing ! ' Then , as they sat there , they heard a slow humming from the servants ' camp , and saw the drivers approaching through the trees . Jim held a jews-harp to his lips and Eph a comb , with its teeth wrapped in tissue paper . Jefferson was carrying a banjo , on which he strummed lightly as he walked . Behind them were the other drivers , all humming in a deep , resonant chorus . Eph stepped forward and addressed Cavin diffidently , his old , stooped body etched against the flames , and his single eye giving him a weird , Cyclops-like appearance.  |p203Mas  ' Cavin , ' he said , shuffling his feet , us thought maybe you and our young mistis might lak a little song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fine ! Go ahead ! ' He drew closer to Lucina , whispering to her that , as a boy , he had often tried in vain to imitate Uncle Eph 's skill . As he spoke , Uncle Eph began to play a slow , haunting tune on the fine teeth of the comb , expertly bending it toward one angle or another , and his head with it . The sound was at one moment like the rustling of leaves or the movement of dried grass , at another like the whirling of water in a small pool . Then Jim joined in with his mournful jews-harp , and , a little later , Jefferson struck up his tinkling banjo . Almost immediately all the men began a low humming , which rose at the end to a magnificent crescendo that left Lucina breathless , filled with some deep , aching pity , for what she could not tell . Then two of the drivers began to clog to the rhythmic clappingof the others ' hands and to the strumming of the banjos , their figures moving like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they followed minutely the lilt and flow of the music . No one noticed how late it was growing until they stopped , breathing hard and bowing elaborately . Well , ' said Cavin heartily , rising , that was a fine show . Uncle Eph , I 'll have to get you to give me some more lessons . ' He smiled at Jim and Jefferson . Why do n't you all see what you can do about showing Jake some o ' yo ' tricks ! ' Lucina slid her hand in his , and they walked slowly over to their tent , standing for some time in front of it watching the light on the prairie and listening , in the warm night , to the soft scuffling sounds of birds and rabbits in the thick grass . All her days , she was to remember those few moments , when life seemed to her to lie out in front of her as clear and plain as the vast prairie that stretched before her eyes , flooded with moonlight and sunk in a strange , fathomless peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke to hear a roaring wind that howled and tore at the tent , and , shivering , heard above that sound a chorus of long , penetrating wails rising and sinking , rising and sinking again . It seemed to her that all the sorrow and suffering in the world was condensed and expressed in the dreary , dismal cries that echoed endlessly over the wild and vacant land . What could it he ? The noise sounded like nothing so much as the weeping of banshees that she had heard described by old mountain women , or like the wailing of ghosts who , the negroes said , deserted their peaceful graves every year on the eve before All Saints ' Day . She lay petrified by fear , too frightened to move , and then she heard rain falling , in violent gusts , upon the roof of the tent , and again , above the rain and the wind , the long , mournful cries coming , it seemed , from some soul beyond the reach of pity . Never in any nightmare had she experienced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and piercing above the rain and wind , the sounds that had awakened her . The wind grew to such intensity that it roused Cavin , who usually slept indifferent to almost any disturbance , and Lucina asked him , in a voice that quivered and shook , what the noise was . He had heard only the rain , but , as he listened , there floated over the prairie again the long , shrieking wails that had terrified Lucina . Oh , ' he chuckled , coyotes out running before the wind . They 'll probably carry on like that till daylight . ' Are they dangerous ? ' she asked him , feeling flow through her , at his touch , the same happy security that always overtook her as a child , when , after a bad dream , she opened her eyes to feel her mother 's arms around her.  |p205Dangerous  ! ' he laughed . To calves ! Hear that norther ! ' he said , drawing the blankets tighter . I hope the rain lets up before daylight . ' But it was five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was spent . Cavin and the men put on slickers and got the wagons started , raising hoops and canvas over several of them , and spreading tarpaulin over the rest . The rain fell in a steady drizzle , and the air was so damp that Lucina 's hair dripped moisture . She could hear the mules ' feet splashing in the wet , where a sheet of cold water lay over the prairie ; and all day long she listened to the sucking sound of the wheels as they pulled in and out the sticky soil . Sometimes the wagons sank up to their hubs in mud , and then Cavin and the negroes would have to get down in the rain and unload the pine branches which Gavin , anticipating the difficulties ahead , had had the men cut and pile into the back wagon . Running these under the wheels that were stuck fast , the drivers would crack their long black whips , and usually the mules , hearing the sound , would pull and strain until the wheels were loose . Sometimes , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unhitchedand added to the team that could no longer move . So , by slow degrees , they made their way across the dismal prairie , with the rain falling and the cold , wet wind forcing its way into every open crack . Maybe we ought to stop and make camp till it blows over ? ' Lucina asked one night , as Cavin entered , dripping , into the covered wagon where she was sitting , with Ma is huddled close beside her . Trouble is , you never know how long it 'll last , ' he replied . No , I think we 'd better keep on . If you can stand it ? ' He threw a commiserating glance in her direction.  | I ? ' she responded in a surprised tone . Why , of course ! But I do n't see how you manage , out in the rain ! ' He sat down , eyeing her with a slow , amused smile . How do you suppose they kept me nice and warm and comfortable in the army ? ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of coffee from the pot that was brewing on the brazier in the wagon , and adding a ration of rum to his own portion . How you making out , Maria ? ' he asked the negro girl , sipping his hot drink in satisfaction . I 'd be shamed to complain , ern Miss Lucy do n't , ' she told him primly , and Cavin threw his head back and laughed at her unhappy face . Never mind , Maria , ' Lucina consoled her . Nothing lasts forever . ' She was surprised herself that she minded the shaking and the jolting , the wind and the dampness so little . It all seemed part of some large drama being enacted around her that she watched , rather than shared  --  watched with the keenest interest . She would peer ! i ) r hours , out of the slit in her wagon , at the long-horned cattle standing hunched together in the opaque mist , with their tails between their legs and their necks drawn back into their shoulders , as if ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and rain . Sometimes groups of them , looking almost like wax figures , would drift along in one direction , seemingly pushed by the wind . Days later , when the weather was again mild and warm , Lucina was amazed to see the agility with which these enormous beasts moved , and the eager attention with which they raised their heads and stared across the grass at the approaching wagons . Watching them , in the slow rain , she had no impression of the ferocity that later she was to learn often distinguished them . Peeping through the slit , she also noticed droves of wildp207horses standing huddled together with water running off their tangled manes and tails . Every now and then a deer with antlers would flash by ; or prairie chickens and wild turkeys , disturbed by the passing wagons , would fly agitatedly into the air , squawking as they settled again on the ground , or on some lone tree or shrub . Sometimes it seemed to Lucina that they had been pushing on like this , in wind and cold rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of her life would be spent in this endless procession leading nowhere , it seemed . For they passed no houses or settlements ; and the wet prairie looked yesterday exactly as it did today , and would , she supposed , tomorrow . Eventually it cleared , as suddenly as the storm had fallen ; and that day they paused , made camp , and dried out their belongings , enjoying a better meal than any they had had since the outset of the rain . Six days out , ' remarked Cavin at supper that night . How many miles do you think we 've made , Uncle Eph ? ' The negro was carrying a plate of hot corn dodgers and a platter of birds wrapped around with bacon , which he had roasted in a black skillet set over the coals , and their brown and succulent appearance pleased him mightily . Taking another approving glance at them , he offered them , with a proud flourish , to Lucina . Laved ! Uncle Eph ! ' Cavin exclaimed , you 're the best cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast a searching glance at the prairie , which offerred so few landmarks . Where are we ? ' he inquired again . I 've kind-a forgotten the way . ' See dat-ar row of trees yonder ? ' Uncle Eph pointed to a shadowy black strip ahead . ' Us ought-a git dar tomorrow , or maybe next day . That 's some less'n half way . ' It 'll take us about two weeks in all , then , ' Cavin calculated.  | Well , ' Uncle Eph responded prudently , I do ' know , suh . Mebbe , mebbe not . Us most generally makes it in dat time , but we 's had a streak o ' wedder dis trip , an ' I specks dar 'll be a powerful heap of mud twixt heah an ' de Brazos . Dar too , ' he added , grinning . There was no more rain , not until the last day , but the ground was wet and sticky and progress slow and halting . Lucina might have thought the last stretch monotonous if the negroes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit which they intended to cook in a stew to be eaten with lye hominy . She was so much amused by the little creature 's blinking eyes and its absurd white tuft of a tail , that she would not let Uncle Eph have it and took it fin- a pet . Soon she and Maria had it eating out of their hands , and , as they played with it , the hours passed and another day was gone . As Lucina jolted across the flat prairie , it seemed to her that she was existing in some separate section of time and space , into which the ordinary cares and duties of life did not enter , and that these days , from the beginning of her life , had been set apart for her to pass through . She felt like a traveller on a train who , for the time being , is removed by his passage through space from any temporal demands ; and she understood that , as long as she travelled in this creaking , jolting wagon , she could enjoy a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole occupants . Now , at least , they could move as they pleased regardless of other people , or of a government that , at Galveston , had seemed to them insupportable and intolerable . But at last they emerged from the open plain into a different region altogether  --  a region full of sprawling trees , enormous in width , heavily laden with moss and mistletoe , and Lucina observed , looking at the ground , that it was no longer gray ,  |p209filled  with shell , or white and sandy , but a deep , rich black , a loam going down , Cavin told her , so deep they had never reached its bottom with any plow . For , he explained , an overflow of the Brazos , while disastrous in its immediate effects , in the long run replenished the soil so well that it had never been necessary to use fertilizer on his father 's place . And the millions of leaves that fell annually kept the ground loose and pliable . Pa wrote to my mother , ' Cavin remembered as they drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile , with water and pasture for cattle and with deep soil for cotton and sugar cane . " ' The words rolled over his tongue almost automatically , coming , Lucina realized , out of the depths of some old memory that she did not as yet share with him . They were following the turns of a yellow river that flowed in and around sand banks in its bed , on and on , in monstrous curves , to its wide and gaping end . On each side of the river great cypress trees extended their huge and groping roots out into the river that flowed over them , indifferent to their presence . This is n't a bit like the prairie , ' Lucina commented . It 's the river bottom , ' Gavin explained , and there 's no better land anywhere . ' He threw out his hand to the river . Look at it , running along there as peaceful as you please . But you ought to see it when it goes on a rampage . The Spanairds who were here first called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ( lied its capers , but in the spring you 'd think it belonged to the devil . They say , though , ' he smiled at his bride , if you once drink out of it , there 's a spell on you so you can never leave these bottoms . Well , ' he sighed comfortably and stretched his long legs out in front of him , mighty few ever do want to leave . It grows on you , somehow ; you 'll see . Stop , , Jake , ' he ordered . I want Miss Lucina to see the woods along here . '  | 0 Snakes ? ' she questioned fearfully . Spiders ? ' Hesitantly she put her foot down on the crunching leaves , and followed him . There 's a live-oak grove I want you to look at , ' he told her , nothing but live-oaks , bigger than any trees you ever saw anywhere . ' A little further on he came to a dead stand , looking down at a bent tree by the road . Why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree I climbed , the day a mad dog got after me . ' He stood staring at it . There 's been war , and surrender , and everything else going on , and here 's that very tree , still here by the side of the road ! ' He blinked at her , for a moment feeling time move mysteriously around him , and then , shrugging his shoulders , went on . And here , ' he continued , picking her up and setting her down in a grapevine swing , here is the vine I used to hang onto and try to touch the top of that tallest tree yonder . See ? Want me to push you ? ' he asked , giving her a light shove . Not that high , ' she legged him , as she began to sway , going higher and higher , until he could easily run beneath her and catch her on the return . She jumped out of the swing into his arms , and he gave her one of the grapevine 's sour leaves to chew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had kept their pockets filled with grape leaves , munching on them all day . He stood looking around him , happy to be at last on his own ground . There are wild grapes and wild plums , too , in these woods , ' he told her , and all kinds of persimmons , and dewberries , and blackberries , and thorn-apples , and pecans , and walnuts , and I do n't know what all . ' Gesturing magnificently , with a wide swing of his arms , he observed , The Lord never intended for anybody to go hungry in Texas . ' Whose land is all this ? ' she asked him , remarking that somep211of the foliage , even in the warm autumn , was beginning to shrivel . Cavin told her that the live-oaks and the holly trees , the cedars , and the graceful rounded haws kept their leaves all winter , changing their color during the colder season from a lighter shade to a green so dark it was almost black ; but that the other trees , obeying a rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stark and bare along creeks filled with still , brown water . And , then , she asked him again whose land they were on . Ours , ' he answered absently . Ours . We 've been travelling on it since early this morning . As soon as we hit the road back there , we were on it . ' He was studying a clearing filled with black stumps . They ought to all be pulled up . That 's tough work , though , ' he told her . His eyes roamed over the fields , and Lucina knew that he was planning some particular task , overcoming its difficulties in thought , before he undertook to do so in fact . Soon , however , his face lighted up and he began to try to tell her how the bottom land looked in spring , when the ground was covered with violets and white Mayflowers and with sweet-smelling shrubs borne down with blossoms , when the locusts and the red buds , the magnolias and crepe myrtles were at their best , when blackberrieshung thick on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it came to him that , after all , there was no need to try to describe to her what she would be seeing with her own eyes in a few months . The thought brought him a sudden sharp satisfaction . He had only to stretch out his hand and , forevermorenow , there would be Lucina . I ' 11 bring you back down here in the spring , ' he promised her happily , picking her up and carrying her , high over the tangled bushes and damp ground , back toward the wagon.  |p212Gavin  , put me down ! ' she remonstrated . But he did not pause until they were almost out of the trees . That 's to show you you 'd better not ever try running away from me , ' he warned her , in mock ferocity , as she lay limp and laughing against him . Do you suppose I 'm likely to want to ? ' she asked him , amused at the idea , as he carefully set her down . Standing there in the circle of his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she felt again the certainty that had come over her the morning she sat waiting for him in the tree at Cedar Ledge . He dropped his cheek on hers , and they stood there without moving , unconscious of the restless movements of the teams halted on the road close by . No , Sweet , ' he replied gently , I do n't think you are going to want to leave me . But , ' with a sudden change of mood , it would n't do you any good if you did ! Come on ! If we 're going to get home by dark , we 'll have to hurry . ' Taking her hand , he led her through the tall berry bushes that screened the road to the waiting wagons . It was  --  Cavin glanced quickly at the sun  --  probably four o'clock . They jolted and humped along the winding road all the rest of the afternoon , making slow and tortuous progress through the sticky mud left by the heavy rains of the past week . For even though it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not quickly drain off this flat , heavy soil . Toward dusk , the road dipped into a slough . Lucina shuddered as she glanced down at the black water which still stood well above the ooze in which the mules struggled , and hoped she would never have to put her own foot into it . Dark fell long before they were clear of the mire . Uncle Matt lighted a lantern and went ahead , with his hand on the bridle of the mules hitched to the front wagon . Then the rain began to fall , in a slow , steadyp213drizzle , which , already Lucina knew , could keep up for clays on end , in this coastal country . Lavin buttoned his slicker around her , and threw a blanket over his own shoulders . Almost there now , ' he said . No use trying to put up the top . See that light through the trees ? A little further and we turn into a lane , and then we 're home . ' But when they had entered the lane , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the mules lay down in his traces and refused , even at the crack of the whip , to budge , and the wagons behind drew up with a loud clatter . The noise penetrated Philip 's office , where , since supper , he had been sitting , going over his experiments . Grabbing the lantern he had used to light his way from the house to his office , he threw a long yellow slicker around him , and , guessing at once what the commotion meant , started hurriedly off down the lane , the light bobbing against his thin knees . His riding horse , he remembered , had stumbled in that hole a few days before . Damn my carelessness , ' he thought irascibly , I ought to have had that place filled in . I ca n't seem to get around to doing all I ought to . Now , I knew when Pilot stepped in t h a t hole that it had to be fixed ! Why did n't I do it ? ' he filmed , angry with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , overtook him . For the moment , having long ago become accustomed to Cavin 's absence , he forgot he was expectinghis son home on the wagon-train . He reached the mud hole and took in the situation . It was after nine o'clock and raining ; it would probably rain all night . They could not hope to get all the wagons pulled past the hole now , in the dark , with exhausted teams in the traces . He made his decision quickly.  |p214Matt  , ' he said quickly , not taking time to ask about the trip , tell the men to unhitch and be sure to cover up the supplies . Then you better go tell Aunt Emmy to make you all some hot coffee and issue dry clothes , all around . Here , ' he fumbled in his pocket , give her the key to the storeroom . I do n't want you all turning up with pneumonia , just when I need you . How 'd you get along ? ' he asked , almost as an afterthought , as he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Gavin , coming to meet him and throwing his arms around his father . Fine , Pa ! ' Philip held him off with one hand and raised his lantern , scanning his son 's face . My God-a-mighty , boy ! For the minute , I 'd forgot you were coming ! ' He put down his lantern and seized Cavin 's hands . Arc you well ? ' Laughing , he ran his hand up his son 's sleeve until he touched his shoulder and saw that it was level with his own . I was looking for a boy , and here you are , tall as I am ! ' Well , I reckon it 's about time I was , ' said Cavin , shaking his father 's hands and gazing cheerfully at him in the flickering lantern light . Full time , because I 've brought home a wife ! ' A what ? ' Philip almost roared , his surprise lifting his voice beyond his expectation . A wife , Pa , ' repeated Gavin . I do n't blame you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted , his eyes twinkling . His father thought suddenly as he watched him , There 's something  --  what is it ?  --  something about the boy that 's like Mary ? ' Where is she ? ' Philip demanded . Gavin ! Are you serious ? ' Certainly , Pa , I 'm serious . And here she is , ' Gavin said , moving over to the wagon and holding out his arms to Lucina . I hope you do n't mind , Uncle Phil , ' said Lucina , in a small , shaky voice , as Gavin handed her over bodily to Philip.  |p215Again  Philip took up his lantern , throwing its beams full on Lucina 's face , holding her to him with one arm while he studied her features  --  her mouth , a little too wide for the delicate chin beneath it , her black , shining hair . I 'm Lucina , ' she told him , shyly , smiling at his bewilderment . Lucina Lyttleton . ' Mary 's niece ? ' Philip asked in astonishment , and saw as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare ! But I 'd have recognized those big eyes anywhere ! ' he said , and pinched her cheek . Cavin , how did you ever persuade this sweet child to accept you ? ' he demanded . I hope we can make you happy , my dear . ' Cavin , ' he said , turning to his son , any woman puts a man eternally in her debt by marrying him ! You 've got to remember that ! ' Smiling down at Lucina , he stooped to kiss her . This is a mighty muddy lane . We 're going to carry you into the house , young lady . ' Letitia was sitting at her piano , when she heard steps on the gallery . Hurrying to the door , she opened it and stood there framed in the yellow light , with her blue dress blowing about her and her light hair standing out , like a nimbus , around her face . It 's Cavin ! ' she cried ; and a moment later they stood in the lighted hall , with the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gavin ! I 'm so glad you are back ! Awl ' She turned expectantly toward Lucina . My wife , ' said Cavin , smiling . My wife , Lucina . I 've been telling her about you , Letitia . ' Letitia was as startled as Philip had been . She put her arm around Lucina 's waist and looked at her searchingly , remarking with a sudden uprise of emotion , how young she was.  | Wife , Cavin , did you say ? ' she said aloud , kissing Lucina 's cold cheek . Why , you had just left off flying kites when you went to war ! And here you come home with a bride ! ' She smiled at Lucina , who , she felt certain , must be wet and tired . Philip , ' Letitia said briskly to her husband , would n't it be a good idea for you to give Cavin some dry clothes and a toddy ? I expect Lucina could stand a glass of wine herself , and a hot bath , and bed . Could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise in her as she turned toward Lucina . Once , years and years ago , she had been as young as this child . Lucina glanced at the hall , with its wide board floors , and at the long gilded mirror , with four candlesticks attached , that hung on the bare , wide wall . That would be pleasant , ' she confessed , realizing all at once , that she was exhausted . Philip and Cavin 'll he discussing crops and the state of the country in a minute ! ' Letitia predicted . You come along with me , Lucina . ' Maria ! ' Lucina ( tied , hesitating . I must see what she 's doing . My maid , ' she explained to Letitia . She 's all right , ' Gavin answered . I told Jake to take her around to Aunt Emory . She 's probably laying out your things by now . ' He looked toward Letitia with an apologetic smile . This trip 's upset Maria more than it has Lucina . Maybe you could put her in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in with Gallic , my own maid , and fix up some way for Lucina to call her when she needs her , ' Letitia replied . I always tap three times , ' she said , handing Lucina a small bronze bell , to tell Caine I want her . You arrange something with Maria . ' Do n't think it 'll stay this damp and cold , ' she remarked as they moved off . It may be hot tomorrow , hot as summer . Ip217hope you 'll be comfortable and get a good rest tonight , ' she added , opening the door to a room where Maria was standing in front of a small fire warming her mistress 's damp nightgown on the fender . When Lucina lay warm in her bed , Maria , looking happier than she had in days , brought her in a glass of blackberry wine , a plate of thin tea cakes , and some cold chicken , flanked by hot buttered biscuits . Us is gwine to like it here , ai n't we , Miss Lucy ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does you need any mo ' tonight ? Ef'n yo ' do n't , Jake say he gwine-a make me acquainted wid de servants . ' No , Maria , ' said Lucina . Thank you . I do n't need anything more . Just open that window , though , before you go , will you , and pick me one of the leaves off the tree ? That one , I think , ' she said , indicating the window closest her bed . Lawzee ! Whut on earth , Miss Lucy ? Is you gone plum ' crazy ? ' began Maria , puzzled , but doing as she was told . Here ' t is . Still wet as all get-out , ' she grumbled , handing Lucina the leaf ' . I'se mighty glad we ai n't sleeping out in dem waggins tonight , ai n't you ? ' Lucina was n't listening . She glanced once at the fig leaf and handed it back to Maria . I knew it , ' she said , falling back on her pillows . Throw it iii the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Gavin and Philip sank into padded rocking-chairs on each side of the dining-room hearth , where tonight there was a snapping blaze . You feel the first norther , ' said Philip , glancing keenly at his son , his face taking on the withdrawn watchfulness that characterized it at a patient 's bedside  --  a gathering of all his senses to ascertain what manner of man and ailment he was dealing with . Then lw struck a bell that brought a little negro girl running in From the kitchen to answer it . Ask Uncle Matt to bring in the toddies right away , will you , Milly ? ' Philip directed her . Then as she turned to go , he stopped her . ' Tell hint to bring along a plate of sandwiches too . ' The boy was tired and cold  --  anybody could see that ; and thin , yes , far thinner than he ought to be . Gavin , who was ordinarily ready to sleep early , was tonight as wakeful as Philip . The anxiety that he had been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now he was beginning to feel more and more anxious about the kind of existence that he had asked Lucina to share . This was an attitude that she never fully understood . From the beginning of their life in Texas , Gavin put her aside , as it were , in a secure corner in his mind , and applied himself to building around her a community fit for her to live in . Evenp219to himself ; he never put this idea into words , but all his life he was unconsciously affected by it . Like a craftsman who designs a jewel case , with little thought for the diamonds it may contain , so , from the beginning , Cavin set his mind , not on Lucina , but on the circumstances that surrounded her . How , he felt rather than reasoned , could she be safe in a county dominated by negroes and alien military rule ? Well , Cavin , ' Philip remarked , leaning back in his chair and carefully cradling his pipe 's ivory bowl in his palm while he gazed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems . ' Matt , entering the dining-room at that moment , laid some pieces of fat kindling on the fire and drew a round table with a fluted edge directly in front of the hearth . On it he placed a small silver bowl containing several whole lemons boiled in thick sugary syrup the color of amber  --  a preparation always on hand in Philip 's house . Then he set a bottle of rum on the table , a silver pitcher of hot water , a saucer of cloves , and two julep cups with long spoons in them . He had slipped on the white coat that always hung behind the kitchen door and stood , with a bootjack in hand , waiting for a pause in the conversation . Standing there , with his head thrown up , in a gesture reminiscentof Philip 's own carriage , he chose his moment and then , kneeling before his master 's outstretched feet , changed his boots to crocheted slippers . I told Jake I 'd take keer o ' you , too , Mas ' Cavin , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , and laughed . Good thing you sent in to Galveston for some boots , Pa , ' he remarked ! , holding out his foot to Matt . These are your new ones . ' I is looked down at the muddy , worn leather , and then up again at his father . I 've been wearing skins on my feet , ' lie explained , and grinned . They 're all the style in Georgia . I had to borrow ap220pair o ' boots to get married in . I reckon they were the only pair in the county , too . ' Yes , I know , ' said Philip . I was down to hides myself , towardthe end . ' He looked Gavin over from head to toe , observinghis mud-soaked uniform . Matt , ' he directed , go see if there 's not an extra pair of pants in my closet . ' Matt came back with them in his hands . Dey could stan ' a pressin ' , ' he remarked critically . ' I ' 11 sen ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiah in do mawnin ' , Mas ' Gavin . ' What 's Jake up to , anyway ? ' Cavin inquired , reaching over to mix himself a toddy , and raising his feet comfortably up on the fender . Here , son ! ' said Philip , staying Cavin 's hand and offering him a drink already prepared . My compliments , and welcome home ! ' He smiled across the cup . Yes , this was Mary 's boy all right . Ile knew just how he felt , young and a bridegroom . It seemed no time at all since he was that age himself . How little he knew then  --  how little ! Sometimes he thought the more a man learned , though , the less happy he was . Like Adam , he smiled . As soon as you eat of the tree of knowledge , you find it 's bitter fruit . Ile kept his eyes on his son , and his thoughts sealed inside his lips . Strange , he thought , that light yellow hair on the boy 's head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heredity business had lots of queer kinks in it . A man 's a fool who thinks he knows too much , he meditated . It 's a pity he ca n't keep on feeling the way he does tonight , all his life  --  just the way he does tonight , ' thought Philip sorrowfully , gazing on his son . Matt stepped forward and mixed a cup for Philip . One for you , too , Matt , ' Philip said absently , stirring togethera pungent drink like his own and holding it out to hisp221servant , who bowed in gratitude and then stood erect , holding the cup , hot and untouched , in his hand . Never , in the years he had served Philip , had he ever poured out a drink for himself in his master 's presence without being told to do so ; nor had he ever in his life drunk his potion before he retired to the kitchen . Will dar be any mo ' tonight , suh ? ' he asked , addressing Philip . No , thank you , Matt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , as he was turning to go , you tell Jake if he 's not on hand early in the morning , I 'll break his trifling neck . ' Yas suh , I 'll tell ' im , ' the negro replied . I hopes you bofe rests well , ' he added from the door , closing it noiselessly as he went out . I do n't know what I 'd a done if you had n't sent me Jake , ' Cavin remarked , as Matt withdrew . You know , Pa , that nigger could rassle a meal out o ' air . I reckon I 'd have starved if he had n't been around  --  plain starved . Mighty nigh did anyhow , ' he said , taking an appreciative sip of his toddy . I got so I was afraid to ask him what he was cooking . Once he told me it was crow , and after that I quit asking . It 's curious , ' he said , lowering his cup and fastening his eyes meditatively on his father , mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the war to free the niggers , they say , and , now the war 's over , but Matt and Jake are just exactly where they were when the fighting began . ' He shook his head , puzzled . What difference on earth can freedom make to them ? ' Philip set his cup down on the table , and , leaning over , poked the fire till it flared up and threw a rich glow over his and Cavin 's faces . You know , I 've thought that a thousand times , ' he said slowly . And that 's exactly what William Charlton said when he refused to vote for secession in the Texas legislature . He said it all through the war , too , although he fought as long and as hard as anybody , after the fighting once began . ' He was silent for some time staring into the fire . Then he roused himself and continued . God knows , ' he added wearily , it 's hard for any man to set another free , or make him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom 's not a thing you can pass around like a basket of apples , the way the Yankees seem to think . It 's nothing you can give to anybody ; it 's what every man alive has to want , and take , and keep , for himself . Is n't that so , Cavin ? ' He fixed his thoughtful eyes on his son , but it was plain he expectedno answer , that he was thinking aloud . Besides , ' he went on , what 's one man 's freedom is another man 's slavery in this world . Now , you take all those shoe factories they 're building up north . Do n't you suppose Matt would feel more of a slave in one of them than he does here , doing most of the time what he pleases ? ' Leaning over he tapped his pipe sharply against the inside of the hearth , and , as he did so , the firelight flamed against his face , bringing out his sharp nose , the deep hollows in which his eyes were sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight eyebrows , which lifted noticeably upward where they joined his temples . Straightening himself , he sat leaning slightly forward with an ironical smile on his thin lips . Yet , ' he went on , that 's what we 're all willing to die for  --  to stay free ! And not one of us knows what freedom means for anybody , white or black . ' I le stopped and gravely studied his son . You 've been fighting , boy , when you ought to have been at your books . You 'll need ' cm to lean on , too , as the years go on . Well , ' he sighed , you 've learned what life is like , anyway , and that 's all book-1p223learning can teach you  --  what life is like , and how to take it when it knocks you down , as it will . Still , ' he meditated , it 's comforting to read what somebody like you , thousands of years before you were born , thought about problems like your own . Sometimes identically like your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup down , clasping his hands behind his head , and putting his feet up beside Cavin 's on the high brass fender . Now , take Horace , ' he went on ; that old Roman had thought a lot about freedom , as was natural in the child of a man who was n't freeborn . Or Plato . Plato had no illusions at all  --  he knew there are mighty few men fit to bear the burdens that freedom calls for . ' Feeling inside his coat he shook his head . I thought I had my Horace here in my pocket . Must be out in my saddlebags . ' Going into the hall , he returned with a small , scarred brownleatherbook in his hand . Then , turning up the wick of the lamp that stood on a crocheted mat in the centre of the dining-room table , he laid the thin volume open , running his finger up and down the lines as he turned the pages . Here , ' he said , here is what Horace says makes a man a slave  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , is free ? The wise man who is master of himself , whom poverty or death finds unafraid , who scorns unworthy ambition . Closing the book , he took his seat again . The Prayer Book speaks of service that is perfect freedom , does n't it ? I serve my country , or my creditors , or my family , do n't I ? Matt serves me , Jake you . Horace is right . Who is free ? I do n't know . ' And yet , Cavin '  --  he stood up and began to pace agitatedly back and forth across the space in front of the hearth , with his long fingers interlaced behind him . Man 's an unreasonable fool . Just the sight of one of those damned black rascals they've sent out to police this county riles me to a point where I stop thinking . ' Suddenly he stood still , studying Cavin 's passive form , while a deepening despair settled over his own features . It looks , ' he observed slowly , as though the Yankees intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darky . God knows why they think that 'll improve matters any ! ' He stood so long silent , staring at his son , that Cavin at last urged him on . With a start , he shrugged his shoulders lightly and began to speak again , in a tired , remote voice . If we 'd had any support at Richmond , we might have rallied the Western armies Oh ! well , no use talking about that now , ' he dismissed the idea gloomily . Maybe it would n't have worked out anyway . When they gave out the order in Texas , late in May , for the soldiers to reassemble in Houston , nobody turned up but a few officers . Thousands were on their way to Mexico , after looting all their own supply depots . ' His expression was like that which always flooded his face whenever he met with an illness he could not cure . Why did the Creator make men subject to pain and frailty ? he always asked himself angrily on those occasions , as he did now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent gadfly , he went on . Some say they intended to join the French there , but nobody knows . Even Governor Murrah scuttled across the border . And those who stayed at home have mighty strange advice to offer . Just look at this letter from John Reagan , for example  --  and he was in our cabinet ! Have you seen it ? It 's here in one of the papers . ' Ile got up and went over to a black iron safe in the corner , where a stack of papers lay folded together . He stood scanning them hurriedly , till he found what he wanted . Listen ! ' he exclaimed . This is what he advises usp225to do . ' Philip began to read slowly from the open page : To admit testimony of negroes in court , and fix qualifications for voting applicable to both races alike . ' Speechless , he laid the sheet down . Gavin , ' he said at last , standing still on the rug in front of his son , and looking at him earnestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't see any end to it all . They say there 's going to be an election and a constitutional convention ; but if there is , all of us will have to apply for a special pardon before we can vote . That means , of course , ' he observed , with a bitter smile , we 'll never vote . Governor Hamilton called for a registration of voters in August , but not one single man worth killing has been allowed to qualify in this county  --  not one . ' His eyes burned and scorn rose in his voice . We 've all held some kind of office , they say , or '  --  he grimaced  --  we own too much property . Since when was it a crime in this country to make a living ? ' he demanded . Or to serve as justice of peace , or on a school board ? ' He threw his long thin hands out hopelessly and his blue eyes were no longer misty , but flaming under his black brows . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned me down . ' For a moment he was silent , sunk in thoughts too bitter to express . Then he dropped into a chair and leaned forward to face Gavin . ' I ' 11 be damned if I 'll apply for a pardon , ' he announced . A pardon fin- what ? President Davis is right in his stand . ' For another moment , he sat still , until his gathering wrath again burst out . Twenty thousand dollars ! It 's absurd ! Who do they want to run this country anyhow ? The scum o ' the earth ? ' The question seemed to answer itself and he went on , in gathering wrath . My children have to live here  --  and yours too ! ' he added , resuming his pacing up and down . Their children , too , after you , and I , and they , arc all dead . '  | What do they think we are made of ? ' he asked , turning in his tracks . Water ? I tell you , Cavin , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out alive , will not endure what 's going on now in this state . And it 's getting worse every day . ' He paused , apparently trying to subdue his mounting emotions . Go on , ' Cavin prompted him . I 'd better know how things are . ' The rule now is , ' Philip continued , almost as if he had never paused in his recital , that planters have to draw up contracts with their negroes  --  contracts satisfactory to the government officials at Galveston . ' He paused , with a significant smile . To get them approved , of course you have to bribe everybody concerned . I simply have n't bothered with any such foolishness , ' he asserted , moving over to the window and staring out into the night , with his tall , severely erect back turned to Cavin . The flames in the fireplace were reflected in the shining panes , and he seemed to be looking out into another room full of light and warmth , a room more strangely real than the one in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who knows what is real , what fancy ? ' He sighed and turned sharply from the window . Cavin , ' he asked his son , emphasizing every word , Do you realize that if any black negro should take a notion to make a complaint against me , for any reason whatever , the military could throw me into jail without so much as a warrant for my arrest ? God knows whether they 'd ever let me out , and , even if they went through the formality of trying me , I 'd have to come up before both our courts and theirs , and the military court 'd be dead certain to convict me . At least , ' he amended his conclusion , ' that 's their record so far  --  for white men of any reputation . '  |p227He  stopped in front of Cavin , turning toward his son a face marked now less by anger than by ironic , bitter amusement . The army claims control over all disputes involving soldiers or Union employees , ' he explained . That takes in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts are supposed to be operating , but '  --  he drew his lips tight  --  they might as well be closed . The Governor has ruled explicitly that the state courts have no jurisdiction over federal agents . Now that the Freedman'sBureau is in Texas , things 'll be worse yet , I suppose , because they tell me that organization has its own courts , too . ' Well , ' he said , sitting down heavily in his chair , there it is . There 's nothing to do but get along the best way you can from day to day , knowing you are sitting right on top of a volcano . ' He sat groping for any facts he had left untold , and , drawing a long breath began again . We drew up a warning last week , after the negro troops tried to kidnap a white child , warning the military that if they can not stop such offenses , we can and will . Every planter in the county signed his name to it , ' he sighed , but God knows whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll throw us all in jail for posting the notice . ' Cavin listened without comment , nodding from time to time . They sent a garrison of armed negro troops into this county in August , ' Philip went on . Fortunately , they stay too dead drunk , most of the time , to do as much damage as they might ; and they spend most of their time hanging around tow n , shootingcraps in gambling dens . But they 'll steal your hams and horses out from under your nose , if you turn your hack . They would have cleaned Colonel Brashear out one night last week , if most of his teams had n't happened to be in Galveston . ' Yes , I saw them , ' Cavin replied , when I was looking for ours . And I had some first-hand acquaintance myself with the Freedman 's Bureau . ' He threw a quick glance at his father.  |p228That  reminds me . I better give you these . ' He hunted in his pockets until he found and handed over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galveston . I 've already run into their fine soldiers , ' he continued , emphasizing the word sarcastically . In fact , I barely missed killing one of ' em before I got out of town . He may be dead , for all I know . So , ' he smiled grimly , I have some idea what 's going on . It 's worse than I expected  --  a good deal worse . Georgia seems to be quieter than this state . Here , sir . Finish your toddy , ' he suggested , refilling the pitcher on the table with hot water from the kettle that hissed on the coals at their feet . Draining his own glass , he set it down , and reached out for another sandwich . In Georgia , Shelby and John Martin --  I believe you know the Martin tinnily ? ' he broke off , tapping his breast . This uniform I have on is John Martin 's . ' I do , indeed . ' Philip settled back in his chair , his youth rising again before him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She was Celeste Daingerfield . They used to make an extraordinary kind of wine on their plantation just out of Charleston . ' I know , ' said Cavin . Rice wine . I had some this summer at Sunny Fields . ' Yes , ' Philip nodded . Your- mother and I have visited there . ' In his slow , resonant voice , he began to inquire about what had happened to his son since he had seen him last . I simply made a jump in the ( lark , ' he declared , when I sent you that letter in care of Devereaux 's . Still , I felt pretty sure you 'd make for Savannah , or Cedar Ledge . That is , if you pulled through . ' He stuffed his pipe again , and held out his tobacco pouch to Cavin , inviting him to help himself . Cavin shook his head , smiling . You 'll think this is funny ,  |p229Pa  , but it 's the honest truth . I never learned to smoke in the army . We used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded men , and , when I was in the hospital When ? Where ? How badly were you hurt ? ' Philip interrupted . Oh , it was n't much . ' With a wave of his square , muscular hand Cavin dismissed the subject and returned to one that interested him more . I did n't know how to smoke then , when I had the chance , and I have n't learned since , ' he admitted with an apologetic smile which made him appear more of a boy than , until now , he had revealed himself to be . For a long time Philip sat watching his son between half-closed eyes . Then he roused himself . Let 's get to sleep the way we used to , ' he suggested , with a game of checkers to settle our minds . They need settling all right , ' he commented . You 'll agree to that , I suppose . It 's too late for any more talking tonight . ' He glanced at the clock above the mantel , which alreadystood at twelve o'clock . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall iron safe , where he stored his valuable papers , Letitia 's jewelry , and such money as he kept on hand . I must show you how to work the combination to this safe tomorrow , ' he told Cavin , picking up the board as he spoke . And here '  --  he indicated where a large pile of newspapers and pamphlets were piled inside a rack above the safe are scene State Gazettes and Houston Telegraphs and old copies of ' the Galveston News and the Brazos Signal that Letitia 's been saving . If you 'll look ' em over , you 'll see how things have been going . ' He pulled the table squarely between them , and , drawing his chair up against it , set the checkers down , with a slight rattle , upon its polished surface . One round , ' he told his son , for a nightcap. '  | They played , intent and quiet , until the clock began to strike the half-hour , and , instead of stopping at one metallic clang , went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board at Philip and chuckled . Same old clock . Once I heard it strike thirty-seven times before it stopped . ' Rising , Philip leaned across the table and touched his son lightly on the head with his sensitive fingers . I 'm glad you 're back , boy . Give my apologies to Lucina for keeping you up so late . You 'll blow out the lamp and bank the fire ? ' After he was gone , Cavin sat for a while in front of the blaze , letting the familiar room again soak into his consciousness . He looked around , noticing the long , cheap yellow table , with six rickety legs , which Philip had picked up at the county seat before he married Letitia , intending to use it only in the kitchen for the servants or on outdoor occasions , like barbecues , when he might need an extra stand . It had served now , though , for seven years , in his dining-room , with a long rude bench , made by one of Philip 's carpenters , drawn up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ranged against the unpainted , unpapered wall , were a number of finely designed chairs that Rhoades Cunninghame and his sister Caroline had brought into the bottoms from Carolina , and a tall highboy , with a pineapple carved upon each drawer , which , Cavin knew , Mary had taken with her from Savannah to Florida , and which Philip , on his last trip back , had brought out to Texas . Over the fireplace , hung a little crookedly , was an oil paintingof Letitia 's grandfather , old Brewster Charlton , her mother'sfather . His head was held high above a tight stock and a black cravat , and the rich ivory tones of his skin and the flashingp231blue of his eyes were amazingly lifelike . Lavin studied the face without recognizing it , and then his glance fell on the wall where hung two crayon drawings of Letitia 's twins which a passing soldier , on leave , had done for some small compensation . They were execrable pieces of work , and the children stared out of the frame like stuffed dolls , lifeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly aware that he had not yet seen his little sisters . He laid his hand on the door , and looked back at the room , remembering that his father expected him to bank the fire and blow out the lamp . The chair he had just vacated was still swaying slightly . It was a plain , pine rocking chair , with a sagging cowhide seat cushioned over with red sprigged calico , like its mate . Lavin sank down into it and leaned over the fender to rake together the ashes  --  a fender of fine brass , delicately designed , matching the tools by its side . The andirons , however , were of black iron , forged in Philip 's own blacksmith shop by the man who made shoes for the horses and metal rims for the wagon wheels . And the stool in front of the hearth , on which the children sat to warm their feet , was only a wooden box covered with padding . Lavin recalled it from his own youth , but then it had had a different covering , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light , he turned its wick low , and was leaning over the tall chimney with his lips drawn together for a vigorous puff , when his eye chanced to fall on the rack above the safe where the newspapers were stored . It had a solid black front broken in one corner by a sketch of a branching tree , and , in the other , by a round , yellow disk rising out of a dark background . Suddenly he realized that the painting on the front of the rack was intended to represent a tree lit up , in the black night , by the rising moon . By George ! ' he exclaimed aloud , slapping his thigh , all my life I thought the dark part of that picture was an enormous pig rooting in the ground . ' He remembered as a child lying on the round rag rug in front of the fireplace warming himself before he got into bed , and studying , as he lay there , the progress of the pig . I 'd have sworn it was a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucina about it . ' Laughing , he went to his own room , that was down the passage from the dining-room . Fourteen steps  --  he counted them , yes they were the same  --  turn to the right at the end of the hall ; one step up , and bend your head . He was inside . The fire was almost out , but the coals threw a soft glow over the shadowy room , with its walls sloping down to meet the floor . He moved silently over to his bed , with its twisted posts and its white ruffled canopy from which always hung , in season , an enormous mosquito net . There , with her head on a long bolster lay Lucina , sleeping as he had often watched her sleep on the grass on hot summer afternoons in their childhood at Cedar Ledge , with her hands crossed upon her breast , and her long dark lashes quiet upon her cheeks . As he stood watching her , he forgot the reports that Philip had been giving him , forgot the war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He touched her fingers lightly , as he bent over her , and , feeling their chill , he drew the covers awkwardly higher . Opening her eyes , she smiled up at him , and was almost instantly asleep again . At sunup , Cavin was wakened by the loud clanging noise of a heavy iron hammer striking against a plowshare = the signal which on their plantation always summoned the field hands to their work . Half an hour later , Aunt Emmy appeared with a tray on which were orange sections laid open like fans on paper napkins , hot black coffee , and buttered biscuits . Cavin heldp233up a warning finger , as she knocked gently and entered the room . Setting the tray quietly on a table beside him , in easy reach , she asked , in a sibilant whisper : Does you remember dar 's two bells , Mas ' Cavin ? One fur dressin ' , one fur eatin ' ? ' Cavin nodded , folding his hands under his head . He wondered if he would ever get over remembering the hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . To the day he died , he thought , he would never cease being grateful for good hot biscuits and coffee . He looked at the oranges and remembered how , every chilly night , Aunt Emmy always peeled the morning 's supply and thrust them , in their white skins , on a shelf outside the kitchen window , leaving them there to crisp in the cool night air . Reaching out his hand , he picked up a stiff section and slipped it into his mouth . He knew exactly how it would taste , with the skin bitter and tough , and the fruit inside sweet as honey , yet slightly bitter and acrid , at the same time . Years later , eating sweet California oranges , he told Lucina how much better the ones tasted that Philip took off English ships at Galveston , along with huge bunches of bananas , and brought across the bumpy prairies to his storehouse on the Brazos . He did not ever know that most of the oranges he ate then , in his youth , grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shipped to England for marmalade , before ever they were put on ships for Galveston . He picked up another slice , and , leaning over Lucina , tickled her lips with it , watching her in amusement . She sat up suddenly , and he slipped behind her one of the big extra pillows which , during the day , always stood in hemstitched , buttoned cases on top the long bolster . I thought I was dreaming ! ' she exclaimed .   Lifting the tray , he set it down on the patchwork quilt . Pa says there 's plenty of trouble brewing in Texas ; but one thing sure , there 's enough to eat . ' He bit into his biscuit , luxuriantly tasting the sweet butter that was churned daily in the big wooden dasher always left to sun out beside the well . Then he noticed two small white packets on the tray and pointed them out to Lucina . With Pa 's compliments , ' he told her , smiling at her puzzled look . It 's quinine , ' he informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your first half cup of coffee . Everybody in the bottom takes a dose every day . ' He stopped and laughed . Everybody but Letitia . Pa 's never been able to get her to swallow the bitter stuff . Says she 'd rather have chills and fevers . Letitia 's like that , ' lie commented thoughtfully . No bigger'n a mite , but dad set in her ways . ' Taking up Lucina 's packet , he poured it into her cup . Here , drink it , ' he urged her . You 'll hardly taste it , in this black coffee . ' They were out walking around in the yard before the second bell rang . It had cleared ( luring the night , and , though the ground was wet , the air was already warming under the sun , and the wind had died down altogether . I ought to set out my flowers , ' Lucina said , looking uncertainlyaround at the clean , sanded yard , with its precise beds marked off in slanting bricks , and filled in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , she noticed , were standing , like her mother 's at Cedar Ledge , in beds of clay and loam . Now , in late October , they were weighed down by yellow blossoms delicately veined in pink . The night 's wind and rain had lashed them about , however ; and their petals were wet and torn , dripping incessantly over thorny leaves stained a soft brick red beneath their shining , green surface . The space under the cedar trees , where Letitia 's bulbs came upp235in the spring , was raked and clear ; and the ground under the large , shiny holly tree by the front gate was packed down and smooth . The light that had blinded Lucina on the prairie seemed diffused and subdued , here on the river . It fell glaringly only on the white board fence enclosing the garden , on the white benches with trellised backs which edged three sides of the yard , and on the similarly trellised gate . Above it , there hung a copper bell that tinkled whenever the latch was lifted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George , who always slept on the door-sill , would rise on his tawny haunches and growl ominously , relaxing into friendly affability only when certain that the entering caller was white , not black . The room in the garden seemed already taken up , Lucina thought , as she looked around . At that moment the bell rang for late breakfast . As they approached the house , the sun came out from under a passing cloud , fully illuminating the long , gray building . Unpainted , it sat low on the ground , barely off it , indeed , with the front gallery covered by a sloping , projecting roof supported on six square , rough posts . Four dormers looked out over the porch , and a wide ell at the back provided space for a kitchen , a dining-room , and a sitting-room opening out , by long windows , on a side yard planned for another garden , but given over , in fact , to chicken-coops . Philip had added this ell the year that he had married Letitia , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon , Philip had built an office for himself outside , adding to the house , at the same time , an extra hall and a bedroom down it for Gavin . The war came on , and the upstairs remained unfinished  --  a place in which to store odd bureaus and broken rockers . Philip and Letitia were already behind their chairs when Cavin and Lucina came in through the front door , down the hall to the dining-room . Chicken hash ! ' cried Cavin , pausing on the threshold . And waffles ! ' Lucina echoed his delight , catching sight of Aunt Emmy as Letitia 's fat cook entered the room , bearing a plate of waffles and two pitchers  --  one of fresh sugar cane syrup , the other of honey mixed with melted butter . My dear , ' Philip asked Lucina , as he took his seat , is there anything you had in mind to do today ? If not --  ' He paused , smiling pleasantly , with a reservation of some kind in his tone . Lucina hesitated . I 've some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out somewhere . I thought perhaps here by the kitchen - - ' She glanced out the long windows toward the back yard cluttered with dog-kennels and chickencoops . Philip leaned hack in his chair and fitted his long fingers together into a precise triangle . How about it , Lettie ? ' he asked his wife across them . Shall we break the news ? As well now as any time , perhaps ? ' She nodded , smiling . News ? ' asked Cavin , as Lucina laid down her fork . They both sat watching Philip 's fact , sensing that he was enjoying his unspoken thoughts . Well , ' he began , looking at Cavin with a ghost of a smile curving his thin lips . It 's been over thirty years now since I came out to Texas to visit your Cousin William . I was a young man then , ' he said , in an aside to Letitia , but his glance immediatelyreturned to his son . I remember that William and I rode all day long up and down the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie to a place where the ground rose up from the river in a long slanting plateau , lightly wooded.  |p237From  the top of that slant , we could see off in every direction , toward the river close by and , further off , toward the prairie that seemed to me then so endless and forlorn . ' He leaned across the table , and his glance sought and held Cavin 's . Always , ever since that evening , ' he concluded , I 've known that some day , if I stayed in Texas , I was going to build a house to suit me on that hill . ' His audience remained silent , realizing that his story was not yet finished . Taking out his pipe , Philip filled it and addressed his wife . My dear , you 've no objections ? Lucina ? Cavin , no use learning the filthy habit . ' Thoughtfully , he walked over to the fire , rolled a piece of paper beside it , and , lighting it , applied it to the tobacco in his pipe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rose again , and , laying his hands on the table in front of him , smiled at his listeners . Wait a minute . I 'll get a map and show you . ' Burrowing in the pigeonholes of his safe , he held up a folded , yellow paper , and , opening it , spread it out on the dining-room table , pushing aside the dishes to make room for the rattling sheet . See there , ' he said , pointing to a firm black cross . Well , that 's a sign I made thirty years ago to mark the place where I expected to build a house some day . I remember writing Cavin 's mother about it . ' Yes , ' Cavin broke in , and I know what you wrote her , too . ' No doubt , ' returned Philip equably . I 've reminded you often enough . Well , ' he continued , sitting fin-ward in his chair , with his hands on the table , I think it 's time to start building that house , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , Cavin ? '  |p238He  turned squarely toward his son . The twins are coming on , and there 's FitzHugh . I sold my land in Florida before the war and leased your mother 's place in Georgia . I figure that income  --  if there is any , now  --  is yours , outright , but '  --  he smiled gently  --  we can pool our resources , I suppose ? Even with the war going on , Colonel Rutherford was able to ship some cotton out of Mexico  --  and he got a good price for it , too . Most of that money went into Confederate bonds , of course , but there 's a little on deposit in London  --  passage money , about . I thought , if the war went against us --  ' Shrugginghis shoulders , he lifted his hands , spreading his fingers apart . When it came down to it , though , I could n't persuade myself to pull up stakes . ' He leaned closer . " Phis place is clear . We can get an advance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it look to you , son ? ' he inquired . Cavin stood up , pushing hack his chair . I think we 'd het ter start building , ' he said decisively . Well , then , ' said Philip , with an easy smile , that 's settled . In that event , ' he went on , Lucy better get her garden started up there , on the hill . ' It was mid-morning when they set out , and the air had lost its chill , but not its freshness . I n the woods , the odor of fallen leaves and wet stumps followed them , but as they came out into the open , the sunlit air was marked by some pungent , exhilarating perfume that it took Lucina years to identify and name hesitantly to herself as the sweet smell of open space . They crossed a little creek , the water coming up to their horses ' knees , and then Philip drew Pilot up , sharply . I here 's the very tree I tied my horse to , thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown grass which covered thep239spot . Toward the west , the rich , black bottom land was cut by the river and a small creek ; to the east , the dun and dreary prairie stretched out to the Gulf . Toward the north , a grove of dark trees rose , like an open fan  --  a grove of oaks , cottonwoods , and bois d'arcs rising in an enormous half-circle , and spreading above them , along the creek , a line of grotesque cypresses . Letitia , Philip saw , was inspecting the location like a visitor , with a tranquil , impersonal interest . She does n't care , ' he thought , reading her mind , as if she had opened it to him . She simply does n't care . ' He tore his attention from her , taking such comfort as he could in Cavin 's delight . He has no idea , ' Philip meditated , that you can give everything you have on earth to a venture , and yet lose , in the end . Like President Davis , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who lay in Fortress Monroe , growing weaker every day . His eyes followed Cavin 's movements with a kind of still , passionate interest . Yes , it would be harder to sec his son frustrated and baffled by life than to endure defeat himself . Lettie , ' he said , strolling over to his wife who stood leaning both arms on a low limb of a mulberry tree , looking absently down the sloping hill . Having children is like offering life several places , instead of one , to hit you a mortal blow . ' She raised her eyes and he saw that she understood him . Suddenly he was sad because she did . Al , ! well , ' he said gently . Even great Jove wept over his children . ' Ile took her hand , and they stood watching Cavin pacing out a square . We 'll have to keep the rabbits off somehow , ' they heard him saying to Lucina . For a moment he seemed to have no solution for the problem . Then he set two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick , like staves , into the ground around the plants . Philip smiled . Over and over he had read how Odysseus , on his return , had stood back for some time , watching his son moving capably about amongst his roistering guests . Now it came to him afresh how unerringly right that story was , how in accord with human nature . I 'd have done the same , ' he thought , with his eye fixed on Cavin , exactly the same . Any father would have . ' That night , Lucina and Cavin sat on each side of the dining-room table drawing separate sketches . Philip leaned over them , studying the sheets . Lettie , ' he called , conk here and look . ' She glanced over his shoulder , and quickly , while Lucina watched , drew two long lines to indicate a wide avenue leading straight from a gate to the house . That would be a nice place to scatter all your bulbs , would n't it , Lucy ? What kind of trees had you night of setting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , no , ' Philip corrected her . Not in Texas , my dear . Cedars do n't do so well in dry years , and , young as you are , you 'd never live to see live-oaks full grown . Better stick to locusts . They spring up quickly after a hurricane Hurricane ? ' Lucina asked , catching her breath . Yes , ' Philip responded firmly , meditating on the point , locusts are your best choice . ' Anyway , ' said Cavin , a grim mask dropping over his features , ' a man who 's been at Chickamauga can do without cedars , all the rest of his days . ' ' d think so , ' said Philip , a glance of understanding passing quickly between him and his son.  |p241After  a moment , however , he smiled down at Lucina , and , laying his hand affectionately on her head , sent an inquiring glance at his wife . Lettie , ' he said , we must invite the county to meet this child , next week . '  |p242DESPITE  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlton enjoyed a close friendship . William often said to Helen , his wife , that , since the night Letitia had driven away from their house with Philip , Povey had ceased to be young , anyway . Then , as time went on , he almost forgot the years that separated them . After they both returned from the army , they would sometimes sit together for hours , speaking rarely , and then about rain and weather and growing crops . Povey acts as if some spring 's broken in him , ' William worried . When he gets well , I must try to stir him up somehow . ' He tried , and continued to try , long after Povey had partiallyrecovered and had moved back from Holly Grove to his own plantation , Land 's End  --  named for the spit of land projecting into the Brazos , where Povey 's uncle , young Tobias Blount , had built his rambling whitewashed house when he first came out to Texas , in 1827 . Povey , ' William would inquire , riding over from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go and call on the two charming young ladies visiting Colonel Brashear 's girls ? ' Povey would smile a slow smile that never rose into his quiet eyes . ' I 'm sorry , ' he would invariably say , but I must see to plantingthe West Field tomorrow . ' Or to building a levee , or top243repairing fences , or to something else  --  William could seldom persuade him to leave his plantation . It 's unnatural , ' William would storm to his wife . It 's against nature for a handsome young man to live like a hermit . I thought if he came back he 'd come back changed ; but he 's back , and everything 's just the same . They walk around like ghosts  --  all of them . Helen , ' he would sigh wearily . I do n't see how it 's going to end . ' Then , her eyes , as black as the long jet earrings she always wore , would grow thoughtful , and she , too , would begin to fret . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would complain , sighing . She recognized this omission , however , as a sign of apathy , not a turning toward sin ; for , on the Brazos , she knew that people regarded their church not only as a road to salvation but also as a component part of their social system  --  as componenta part , indeed , as their courts or their plantations . Therefore , she understood that Povey was not necessarily renouncing his faith when he stayed away , as he did , from the little church where Letitia 's children had been christened respectively Felicia , Letitia , and FitzHugh . There , on Sunday mornings , the white people always seated themselves downstairs , while their servants occupied the h ; Ilcony . Afterward , family groups were apt to join their relations , all driving together to the little creek and spreading their dinners out side by side on long , white tablecloths laid flat on the ground . Time after time , in the past , Povey had sat by , while cold fried chicken was being exchanged for minced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sieved egg yolk ; or while pear chip preserves were being passed , or yellow pound cake . Time after time , he had sat listening to all the county gossip ,  | as he watched his friends pouring grape and blackberry wine out of great brown jugs . But not any more ; he had given up going to church altogether , now , it seemed . Even the Bishop no longer made any effort to persuade Povey to accompany him , when he arose , as he often did , at Land 's End early on Sunday mornings and started off to early service alone . Sometimes , though , they would sit for hours under Povey 's lacy chinaberry trees talking of war and , after that , of men 's strange passions and dark fears and long unanswered prayers . Theirs was a companionship which drew from two different sources , which met and merged in a poetic faith based less on theology than on a strong sense of the mysterious beauty moving in this world  --  - a beauty which , they both agreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the wind , and the rain . You know , ' Povey admit it 'd late one black night as they sat talking together , I ca n't follow you all the way . Take your creed , now- ' he protested , leaving his sentence half finished . What arc creeds but words ? ' the Bishop replied , in his clear , flowing voice , turning a thoughtful face toward the leaves above him . And what are words ? There 's nothing stranger than a word , Povey  --  that frail net in which men try to enclose every kind of meaning . " The Word was made flesh "  --  that is the eternal mystery . ' The Bishop 's gaze wandered slowly out across the dark sky and his ear caught the sound of ' the wind moving thinly in the cypresses by the river  --  a sound quite different from the heavy bass with which it sang through the oaks . He listened a moment wondering how to explain what had brought him to Texas and kept him there . Could any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest and dearest ?  --  he pondered.  |p245Then  he remembered a line he had read and marked a few days before in an old book of English sermons and he repeated it to Povey . " To hold a flickering candle in Time 's dark hall "  --  that is what the Church has to do , is n't it ? ' he asked in a voice that revealed how often he had argued this same subject with himself . He paused , and his eyes , set strangely aslant under his high brow , glowed with some urgent conviction . I am in Texas to hold up that candle , ' he said , at last . The priests of Isis and Buddha have had the same duty to perform . ' Povey smiled in the dark  --  a sorrowful , fleeting smile . I have not so good a reason for being here , ' he said . I am in Texas because I first loved one woman , and then another , and have since loved nothing , not your God , or Isis , or the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he peered through the dark into the Bishop 's face . You married her to him ! ' he exclaimed , sitting upright in his chair , as the words poured suddenly and hotly across his lips . The Bishop spread out his slender , brown hands and dropped them in a weary gesture . I 've always known you were going to say that to me , Povey . Because a man wears my cloth is no reason he wo n't on occasionbe a fool and a sinner , too , unless the Lord prevents him . I know . I 've been both  --  and that was one of ' the times . ' He locked his thin fingers behind his back and began to walk back and forth in quick , impatient strides . Povey sank back into his chair , as still as he would be when he was dead . It was the first time he had ever spoken his mind , the Bishop reflected , and probably it would be the last time , too . Therefore , when his pacing brought him again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him.  | Povey , tell me  --  I had hoped the war and her children --  He broke off , interrupted by a short , harsh laugh out of the darkness . What difference do her children make ? I 've sense enough to know that now  --  though I did n't at first . As for the war ' Leaving his sentence unfinished , he began another in the cold , quiet voice of man uttering a simple fact . I never dreaded death as much as I do life . ' Yes , ' the Bishop thought with one part of his mind , while the other followed Policy 's voice , that 's why confessions are heard in dark churches  --  a man will not talk in the light . ' When I saw how things were , ' he ventured , I was afraid Yes , ' Povey interrupted , I know you were . I 'll admit I thought of that possibility , myself . I still do . Yes , ' he said , suddenly rising and ladling into step with the Bishop , I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day yet I do n't think of it . I 'm not such a fool as to suppose that God  --  if there is a God  --  would count it an offense . ' I lc kicked away a stick that had fallen in his path , and laid his hand on his friend 's arm , swinging him sharply around . Ca n't you see ? ' he demanded . We were too young to understand that nothing in the past or in the future mattered ; she was hurt and I , too  --  unbearably hurt , I thought . Your God should spare mankind front being young , my good Bishop , ' he ended bitterly , and then , after a moment 's silence , began again to move restlessly back and forth across the wide yard . I saw from the very beginning that there was no answer , no way out for any of us  --  all of us being what we were . If we had been savages , it would have been simple . But being what we were '  --  he sighed deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer ? ' Breaking his step , he moved over to the fence , leaning on the white top rail.  |p247Over  there , ' he pointed , she is . Here am I. Can you suggest what to do , my friend ? No , ' he said slowly , do n't answer . I know you ca n't , but a Hottentot could . ' He gazed out into the night . Plenty of men in this state , too , would call me a fool , and sometimes I think they are right , ' he admitted , lifting his gaze across the dark and vacant fields . Sometimes I despise myself . ' They stood there together , without speaking . The frogs begantheir nightly croaking in the river flat , and an alligator 's deep muttering roar broke across the quiet . That 's why we 're friends , ' said Povey , because you do n't know any sure answers , either . Come on in to bed . ' He laid his arm around the Bishop 's broad shoulders , and they stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following his own thoughts out into the blackness that surrounded them . The Bishop sighed and stirred at last . God knows I wish I did , Povey . ' They were at the doorstep when he put out his hand and touched his friend . I hope you 'll go tomorrow , Povey , ' he said in his most persuasivevoice . Povey stared at him . Go ? Go where ? ' Then in a flash he understood . Of course . Philip would be welcoming Ca vin home . The boy was back , he had heard , with a wife . Suddenly his old despair quickened within him , and on an unreasonable impulse , he made a sudden decision . No , ' he replied sharply ; I 'm not going ; I 'm not even invited . I 'm going down to Berryville tomorrow , to the dance judge Symington 's giving for his nieces . ' It was the Bishop 's turn to stare . He could hardly have been more astonished . You 've been advising me , ' said Povey sternly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good advice and I 'm accepting it . That 's all . '  | As the Bishop prepared for bed , he meditated on how little he liked the turn his advice had taken . All night , he was restless ; but when he left early in the morning , he decided that it was best not to reopen the conversation of the night before . As he rode away , he found himself thinking of his home in Cheraw , and was suddenly homesick for it . This was a strange country , Texas . Every day here , he ran into a problem he could n't solve . There had been months in Carolina , after he had given up his legal practice and entered the Church , when nothing more urgent than a christening had come up , when he had even had all the time he needed to write a history of the Cheraw Indians . This wo n't do , ' he said , and fell to planning his work . Now , ' he thought , I might just try holding service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can sing chants , ' he mused , and - Wade a sudden decision . A bar-counter ought to make an acceptable altar . ' He touched his ma c , firefly , lightly with his spurs . He was due at Locust Hill by noon , and he had three or four sick people to visit first . A few hours later , when he turned into Philip 's lane , he saw ahead of him a long procession of Philip 's friends . Some were riding Kentucky mares , decorated with the faded rosettes and ribbons which they or their sires had won in old , forgotten races . Some were on tough little mustang ponies , with tangled manes , hard mouths , and resentful , rolling eyes . Others came in gigs pulled by nervous , wiry horses with delicate , twitching ears and long , well-shaped legs . I n the midst of this procession , one figure stood out , like San ( ho Panza , from the crowd  --  the shrivelled figure of old Mr. Archibald Bland , who sat his freckled , gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charger , and from time to time shifted the greenish tails of his long black coat more evenly across the creature 's rump . He owned a three-acre island in the river , deeply shaded with live-oaks , and there he lived with his dogs and his chickens and his old mule , Gabe . What more does a man need ? ' he would ask Philip , whenever they fished together from his leaky boat . He kept Gabe 's mane roached and upright , but even then the cockleburrs would get into it , and at last he let them stay there  --  just as he let the steps to his house fall down and stuffed the hole in his skiff with rags . For not since his wife and children had been trapped in a burning house had he consideredlife worth taking much pains about . He was accompanied by young Doctor David Armstrong , only two months home from the war , who was reining in his prancing mare to keep pace with Gabe 's stiff legs . He had inheritedhis father 's plantation , Shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the yellow river , he and his younger brother Byrnes lived alone . Byrnes was running the place , David informed old Mr. Bland , and he himself had not yet decidedwhether to practise medicine here in the county , or in Harrisburg , where the crumbling capitol of the Republic still stood , overlooking Buffalo Bayou . He remembered , as he rode along between the locusts , that the man beside him had also lingered , on spring nights , under the shadow of the Rotunda at Charlottesville , and began at once to talk to him about the University . David had enlisted in Virginia , where his Hither had sent him to study medicine ; and he had not been in Texas for now nearly six years . His listener had not been in Virginia for twenty ; but they soon found they shared many recollections . Yes , yes , ' responded old Mr. Bland absently , as though he were recalling a familiar dream . He too knew how the Univer- sity lawn looked between midnight and morning , with the white colonnades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . A carriage drove up behind them . William Charlton , in the seat beside his driver , raised his carriage-whip , with its flowing red ribbon , high in salutation . Fine day , gentlemen ! ' His hair was combed away from his face in front , but he still wore it long in back and about his ears , where , despite vigilant clipping and brushing , his short sideburnscurled against his cheeks . Lowering his whip , he lifted his wide hat , and his keen blue eyes gleamed pleasantly as he passed his friends . With him were his wife and two guests just then visiting at Holly Grove  --  Judge Duval White , from Berryville , and his sister , Miss Clarissa , a little wisp of a woman with a wide , firm mouth . She had learned music in South Carolina and was teaching it now in Texas . Clarissa , ' her brother sometimes said to her a little anxiously , you just missed being strong-minded . ' She looked after him with meticulous care , and every day had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black tie that he wore with the ends crossed , but never knotted , under his flaring wing collar . The Judge would never have thought of such matters himself . His mild gray eyes stared out too absentlyon the world to take note of creases in a coat . Does a man have to tie his cravat if lie does n't want to ? ' he would demand mildly , but firmly , whenever his sister remonstrated with him . Judge Toombs Dickerson , from Austin County , was standing on the gallery at Philip 's house when Judge White arrived . Stepping modestly out of the carriage on a box provided for that purpose , Miss Clarissa threw a sudden searching glance at her brother . In her mind she was comparing him , to his advantage ,  |p251with  the tall man who stood lounging against Philip 's gallery , stroking a flowing brown moustache . Toombs Dickerson was born at Velasco and had never yet put foot out of his native state . His father  --  a Georgian  --  had been massacred with Fannin at Goliad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken part in the celebrations which followedSanta Anna 's capture at San Jacinto . At seventeen , he began to read law and , later , served as county judge before the war broke out , when he was assigned to the defense of Galveston . In April , 1865 , he saw no reason whatever for Texans to surrender because Virginians had . Still he was , above all , a man of common sense , and when the troops failed to reassemble at Houston in June , 1865 , he realized , at last , that the struggle was over . Returning home , he found a deputation of citizens waiting to welcome him back . Next day , without the formality of an election , he resumed his former office , sitting with two pistols in easy reach and the flag of the Republic nailed high up behind his chair . Never , except in court , was he ever seen with his wide hat off his head ; and even there he wore his tight trousers stuffed inside his high boots  --  and , in the hottest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his sister had to admit , did not know more law than Toombs Dickerson , nor could he bow more politely to a lady . Miss Clarissa surveyed Toombs now , however , with a vague air of distaste which he recognized . It was a warm day for November , and he wore no coat over his pleated white shirt , only a striped vest made with a high , turned-do w n ( ) liar edged round with silk braid . This buttoned up cinder his brown chin , almost hiding the ready-made cravat which , in deference to the occasion , he had snapped on beneath his soft collar . He had discarded his boots , for the day , in Favor of a pair of shoes with comfortable toes and elastic insets at the ankles ; and as he had left home that morning , he had lifted his enormous black hat off its cowhorn rack thinking he did very well . This , however , he saw at once , was not Miss Clarissa 's opinion . Smiling , he came forward to swing open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to a kind of prickly , armed neutrality , so now he began , in his deep , drawling voice , to tease her , his alert eyes , more yellow than brown , twinkling as he spoke . Miss Clarissa , ' he demanded , when you reckon you 're going to get me all dressed up slick and fine , like the Judge here ? ' He held out his hand , as he spoke , half-winking at Judge White across his sister 's thin shoulders . The two men shook hands heartily . A few weeks before , they had planned a couple of days ' shooting together , but a riot had prevented them from carrying out their intention . Too bad we never got those partridges for breakfast , Judge , ' said Toombs now , recalling the emergency which had arisen in the narrow section where their counties joined . The three of them now walked over to speak to Letitia and Philip , who were standing in the yard , with Cavin and Lucina beside them . Good morning . Good morning ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce . . . ' Philip repeated time after time , Glad to see you .... How are you ? ' A good many of his guests thought , as they passed him , that with his straight back , his shadowy blue eyes , and his still dark hair , he was handsomer than his son . His long black coat , held together at his throat with a large single button , just escaped his knees , accentuating his height . His trousers , with their tight legs and very wide cuffs , had been made before the war , and likewise his frilled white shirt , but they became him well . Cavin 's shoulders had yet to fill out , his thin body to take onp253more weight , before he would make as impressive a figure as Philip . Perhaps that time would never come . The next man to ride up was young Mr. Alexander Winston , who , like Cavin , had fought in the Fourth Texas and had left an arm in Virginia . As he saw him dismounting , Philip remarkedunder his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the Winstons he ever saw  --  the same shining , black hair and cold , gray , searching eyes , the same narrow head and furious , reckless temper that never seemed to smolder out . He came alone and was eager to talk with his stocky young neighbor , Mr. Thomas Abernethy , whose connections at Shelbyville , Kentucky , had been kind enough to entertain him , Alexander , during a brief furlough between battles . He wanted to ask Thomas , too , how the fighting had been on the Border , where Thomas had been stationed throughout the war ; and whether he had seen any of the camels President Davis was said to have turned loose there during the Mexican War , twenty years earlier . Lord ! How I'd-a hated being stuck down there ! ' Alexander groaned , and then smiled as he saw Thomas approaching with his two stoutish , older sisters , whose figures revealed their strange passion for cake and pickles at unaccountable hours . Alexander paused . How are you , Miss Minerva , Miss Eliza ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled his smile in her dreams ; but next morning , being a realist , she took a stern glance at her near-sighted eyes and her pudgy figure , and put aside her dream . Somebody 's got to run this plantation , ' she told herself resolutely , and set about doing it with energy and competence . Already she could tell that her young brother Thomas was goingto be better at books than at cotton-planting . She didn't mind . She had plenty of ideas herself about managing the place . If the Lord did n't make a girl pretty , she reflected thankfully , He nearly always gave her good sense . Not that it was altogether a good exchange , but still  --  there was that new Hungarian grass everybody was talking about , for fodder . She resolved to plant some . As Miss Minerva passed by Philip , old Mr. Tripp Cuttross approached  --  old Mr. Cuttross , who could lift his hat like a prince and often boasted that he lived on a dollar a week . Sober , for once , ' thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Davidson Rideout , who , after the war , had started up a tiny store on the road that passed his place , where he never remembered to dust the shelves . He wore a spotted pair of trousers , but he was known to have his boots polished every day and never  --  not even in August  --  to leave off his coat at meals . His wife , like himself ; was brought up in Annapolis , where , except for the war , their daughter , Evelina , would now have been in school . Now , of course , she would never go , a fact which distressed her parents far more than it did her . Her father had never had a large plantation in Texas  --  only a few hundred acres , and nobody knew how he held on to that , nowadays . Mrs. Horatio Spurlock , coming up behind Evelina , paused to admire the fit of the young girl 's dress . She had reason to do so , for she had made it out of one of Mrs. Rideout 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier than a business man , so , since the war , she had quietly taken to doing fine sewing , being careful to put it out of sight whenever dear Horatio was around . She examined Letitia 's frock also , finding no fault with the numberlessrows of narrow tucks which she had stitched into its wide skirt , nor with the smoky blue velvet ribbon with which Lucina had laced her basque . She stood back a moment admir/ing the taste which had dictated exactly that combination of blue with ashy rose . I do declare , Lettie , ' she told her , kissing her , you get prettierevery single day . You 'll have to , ' she added , kissing Lucina too , to keep up with this young lady . ' Stopping in her tracks , she smiled at this bride of Cavin 's  --  this slight , dark , glowing girl , with such shining , dark hair , such happy , brown eyes and smilinglips , lips almost as red as the dress she was wearing . Hum ! ' thought Mrs. Spurlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she admitted , whoever dipped it knew how . ' She leaned over and , on an impulse , kissed Lucina again . Gavin , ' she remarked severely , you stole a march on us . And all the girls in the county setting their caps for you , too ! ' Two men came late , John and Kirby McGaughey , with their wives and sons . They were middle-aged brothers , with a great deal of iron-gray hair , loud , rumbling voices , and extremely activefeet inside their high boots , which they wore everywhere , their spurs clanking at every step . Since the war they had taken up cattle-raising on a big scale . They were always telling Philip that , with things the way they were , it was a heap better sense to turn to white labor . When the bush fall season was over , now , most of their cowhandswould go back to working in stores in the German settlementat the far end of the county , or back to the little , sandy tracts of scrubby prairie land where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Freedman 's 13m-eau , they devoutlyhoped , would never come poking around demanding contracts between free white men . Philip , ' John said , shaking his host 's hand , better come into the cattle business with us . These fool contracts they 're talking about now 'll drive you plumb crazy , if you keep on planting cotton . '   The Bishop fell in behind him . There was nobody he enjoyed talking to more than Philip , but he passed on to get acquainted with Cavin . ' I knew your mother , ' he told Lucina , when I was a young man visiting around in Savannah . ' He began to tell her about those days now , with evident relish and no sign of hurry . Do n't you go monopolizing the belle of the ball , Bishop , ' said Colonel Rutherford , who had come in from Galveston . ' I have n't spoken to her yet . ' 1 le smiled at Lucina and spoke hastily to Philip . Colonel Ashbcl Smith sent you his apologies and regrets . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matagorda . ' ' Ah ! I 'm sorry , ' said Philip . ' Lucina , you must meet the Colonel later , when he recovers . He is one of our Texas proselytes , ' he informed her , ' a Northerner who served both in the Republic and the Con ! i.deracy . ' She held out her hand to Colonel Rutherford , smiling ; and Philip turned to welcome a tiny lady just approaching . ' How do you do , Mrs. Dyess ? ' Philip said warmly . And Miss Winnie Lee ! ' he exclaimed , holding out his other hand . How are you ? ' Colonel Rutherford smiled and bowed , too . He admired Mrs. Dyess without reservation . She had a delicately formed body ; and , although she was well on to fifty , an eager , childlike face . But her looks were deceiving . All alone she had come out from Mississippi , a widow with her three boys and her slaves , and had taken out an extensive head right at Oyster Creek to equal that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her all his propertybesides. ' 1 is a pity she is n't a man , ' Colonel Rutherford often thought , and then wondered why he thought so . She made a better job of cotton-raising than most men , and she was , he admitted , remarkablypunctual in meeting her obligations.  |p257You  're looking well , Miss Winnie Lee , ' said Philip cordially , directing his attention to Mrs. Dyess ' companion . Still sleeping late ? ' Everybody knew Miss Winnie Lee , who , despite ten years of matrimony , had all the characteristics of an old maid . Men , she sniffed , were poor creatures  --  all except John Kempers , whom she had married . He was as poor as Job 's turkey and had had only one thing to offer her  --  the privilege of sleeping as late as she pleased in the morning . Miss Winnie Lee had never combed her own hair until she became his wife . But they had been happy . Now he was buried in Virginia , in deep red clay ; and she lived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to paint on fine china , and their boys to keep their feet off other people 's chairs , and to look a questioner straight in the eye . Last of all , came Colonel Carpenter Brashear , a widower , with his two pretty , vivacious daughters , Miss Sabra and Miss Alice . His rusty carriage-top was folded back , and carpet no longer covered the floor of the swaying vehicle , but the horses that drew it were rubbed down and shining , and the coachman that drove it knew how to hold up his reins . Sorry to be late , Philip , ' Colonel Brashear apologized , taking out a hemstitched pocket handkerchief and dusting his strong , brown hands , but I met up with a couple of rascally soldiers who took a fancy to my horses . Fortunately Howard Blakely came along with his boy , and here we are , ' he concluded , with the horses . ' I hope we all have as much luck , ' Philip congratulated him . Letitia , you remember Ruthven , of course ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , who , since Cold I larbor , had been sunk in perpetual melancholy , with the sight of one eye gone entirely , and of the other nearly so.  | Bishop Gregg had been in Texas only a few years . Therefore gatherings like this interested him immensely . He took his seat in a rocking-chair on the front gallery and watched the people moving amongst the rosebushes . A stranger , he thought , might well wonder what common tie all these friends enjoyed . But he had lived long enough in the state to know that those who had had a similar bringing up in the older South naturally flocked together in Texas . Whether newcomers possessed money , or lacked it , was of far less importance in this bottom , he reflected , than whether they were disposed to fit easily into the pattern of life already established on the Brazos . He had tried , without much success , to explain these matters to Major Bradford , a Northern army officer recently sent into the county  --  a man who was a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out . Soon they discovered that they had met before , when the Bishop was on a summer 's visit to a classmate 's home in New Jersey . Now Major Bradford was stationed , not at Berryville , where the largest garrison was , but down the river ten miles , at a small outpost where cotton claimed for the Federal Government was stored . And yet I 've never been able to make him understand the situation here in Texas , ' the Bishop thought . Never . ' For a moment his mind hovered anxiously around the case . Maybe I 'd be wise to ask him if he ever read Burke 's great chapter on how often folly and madness are perpetrated in the name of liberty , ' he mused , and immediately rejected the idea . He 'd be certain to quote Carlyle back at me , ' he decided , a half smile . appearing on his lips . How 'll I ever explain this country to him ? ' There were so many things Northern people in Texas had to be told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder it was easier for Southerners to flock together . ' For instance , ' the Bishop went on thinking , there is theP259county judgeship . The planters on the Brazos seem to reward their judge exactly as they do their bishop  --  when they market their crops . ' The circumstance had bothered him when he first came to Texas , but not any longer . He had learned better how to interpretevents on the Brazos , where the planters preferred to lay their own roads , and pay the costs of justice direct . Was n't it cheaper , they reasoned , to look after things yourself than to pay a lot of clerks at the county seat to do it for you ? So they kept the tax rate low , and burned the notes with which the judge sometimes supplemented his meagre salary . Yet they would not have elected a judge whose integrity they held in doubt . Yes , ' the Bishop thought , his mind returning to the point from which it had circled , that 's why we all get along  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Things like Mr. Cuttross 's habit of sitting on his front gallery in his nightgown on hot days ; or '  --  his eyes grew sad  --  Povey 's absence here today ; or why nobody ever mentions his family to Tazewell Barclay . ' His eye fell pityingly on a man just then talking to Philip  --  a man whose wife never accompanied him to gatherings , whose son , as everyone knew , had fallen on ev it ways in New Orleans . Why , ' thought the Bishop , rising , I 'm getting to be it regular Texan myself ! ' He was going over to inquire how FitzHugh was when he saw that Philip seemed to be explaining something to a group of people gathered around him . The Bishop got up and strolled closer . If you will all be so good as to walk hack to the river , ' Philip was saying , the cowboys from Lost Island Ranch will proceed to demonstrate what poor riders most of us are . '  |p260As  he paused , a number of cowhands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through the open stable gates , to the field behind the barns , where Philip had raised enough tiered seats to accommodate his guests , and a stout board fence to protectthem from the plunging horses . The riders advanced , with their blue-checked gingham jumpers swelling backward in the breeze . They were all wearing bright handkerchiefs loosely tied around their necks , and wide hats with jagged holes cut in the crowns to let in air . They wore no chaps , however , such as were needed in west Texas where thorny bushes tore incessantlyat a rider 's legs . Their boots and spurs were dull , and their ponies ' sides had never felt a currycomb ; but each man sat his horse with a slouching , easy poise ; and horse and man , by some indefinable sympathy , seemed to move as one . Lucina took her seat on the tiered benches and leaned eagerly forward , as Gavin warned her to keep an eye on the men , who were limbering up their muscles in the field in front of them . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful circles precisely where those who wielded them expected them to fall . Some of the men were sitting idly on the fences whirling their ropes with easy , negligent gestures , making amazingly intricateloops and whorls . Others were walking carelessly about , throwing their ropes upward in various involved figures , their bodies swaying in perfect balance with the fall of the coil . A stranger , observing the facility with which these tricks were performed , might have supposed them easy to imitate , but Philip 's guests were not so easily deceived . One of the McGaughey cowboys , in fact , spent most of his spare time trying to make a rope stand up straight and stiff , like a pole , in the air . Somewhere , he had heard , there were Indianswho could manage that trick . Now , if I could do that , it 'd wake ' em up , ' he told himself , relishing fame in his ownp261way , and meditating on the fact that no Indian he had ever laid eyes on could even rope a calf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had to content himself with shaping a perfect figure eight into the air . Then the horses were let in the pen . Lucina saw at once that they were exactly like those she had watched huddled in the driving rain , as she had bumped across the prairie from Galveston . But now , excited and quivering , they were running in long circles , neighing and whinnying for an exit they could never find , for all their frantic searching . Each cowboy carefully aimed his rope at a particular animal 's two front feet , and , edging forward with infinite care , approachedhis chosen mount , crooning in a gentle singsong as he advanced . Some of the men were determined to get saddles on the wild ponies which stood drawn back , quivering in every muscle , pulling away from their tormentors . Others waited only to slip a bridle into their ponies ' mouths before mounting them . Lucina felt sure every man on the horses would be killed , for the frantic creatures either dashed toward the high board fence or stood snorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air , their eyes rolling red and furious in their heads . But before long she heard the people cheering around her , and sIVA that the men who were attempting to ride these wild horses could actually do so . Soon horse after horse began to tire ; and soon one rider after another was leading his subdued mount back and forth in front of the grandstand , bowing and sweeping his hat to the ground in recognition of enthusiastic applause . From time to time , all afternoon , Matt had been cocking his ears , cupping them with his square , black hands , to listen . As soon as he heard the cheers slackening , he started stirring the coals in the barbecue pit . The company would soon come chat- tering down the path to the river expecting dinner , which was usually served at three o'clock , and it was now nearly four . Young niggers like Jake and Maria , Matt meditated importantly , might manage to get off and watch the festivities ; but  --  he tested the sizzling beef with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Emmy , Mas ' Philip was depending on them . Carefully he mixed up a fresh batch of spicy , hot , red sauce with which to baste the browning meat and sniffed , with expert care , the aroma pouring up from the hole . " Bout right , ' he first congratulated himself ; and then shook his head . ' A mite more pepper . ' Looking up , he saw Aunt Emmy coming down the path to join him , swinging her broad hips , and carrying in her arms a basket of rolls . Since early morning she hat . been baking them , using the yeast that she always kept rising in a crock where bubblescontinuously 1inrrnrd and broke in a foamy mixture of cornmealand potato water . She began singing a slow , rising chant as she walked , bringing buttered rolls to lay on the long tables that were arranged near the pit . ' Lawd ! Look at dem tables ! ' she said to Matt , appreciatively sucking her lips at sight of ' the full boards . ' Dar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miz Rideout 's mashed potato salad , an ' Miz Spurlock 's minced chicken . Who brung dat ar ' batch o ' stickies ? ' she asked , critically sampling one of the round crusty circles sprinkled liberally with cinnamon and sugar . ' Dey 'll do , ' she decided , chewing reflectively , ' but I 'd a made ' em a mite shorter , ef'n I 'd been makin " em . Lemme taste dat cawffee , Matt . Las ' time you made it  --  fo ' de war , war n't it ?  --  you biled it too long . ' ' ( pct away fum heah , woman , ' Matt replied . ' I knows my business ; you ' tend to your'n . ' Matt imagined he could hear the company all talking now.  |p263'Phili|p  , you must send Matt over right away to show my cook how to barbecue meat .... Uncle Matt , I 'll just watch you mix up that sauce .... Philip , my cook ca n't equal yours , that 's certain . ' Lawd ! Dey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heah meat 's gwine-a git too done . ' The ladies began coming down the path first , taking their seats on chairs and blankets spread around the tables . The men followed them , in groups of two or three , discussing the rope throwing . As soon as they smelled the roasting meat , however , they quickened their pace , suddenly aware of a great hunger . Matt glanced importantly at the younger negroes who were helping him , and they fell into action , passing thick , aromatic slices of beef , brown and crusty on top , shading toward pink in the centre , and steaming cups of black , bitter coffee . For a few hours , the war seemed a long way off , like a bad dream receding into the past . After supper , when Philip 's colored singers appeared , nobody remembered that Sheridan sat at New Orleans , carrying the fate of every listener in his impatient hands . Or that , nearer yet , an enemy garrison of ' black troops was at their very doors . Just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I ' %t. an appointment with Major Bradford , ' he explained . I marvel at your patience , ' Philip replied , accompanying him to his horse . Dark fell early in November , and the light front the fires began to flicker lower and lower . The ladies moved back up the path to the house where some gathered on the porch , exchangingnews , and others around Letitia 's square old Chickering piano . The men remained seated in a circle , waiting for Matt to ap- pear with a wide japanned tray full of silver cups ringed round with curly orange peel . They were not disappointed . Toombs Dickerson lifted his cup , dropped his nose over it , and rolled his eyes upward , sinking back against a tree with a sigh of utter content . Philip ! ' he exclaimed . ' If you asked me for my best saddle horse right now , I 'd likely give him to you . ' Philip smiled , and stood up , running his eyes over the group , with the smile slowly fading off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , which , against the shadows behind him , gleamed white and ghost-like , as if separated from his body . Gentlemen , ' he began , ' I will waste no words . When a convention is called  --  if it is called  --  we 've got to be ready to elect a delegate . Who is it going to be ? ' John McGaughey laughed , shortly . ' You mean , who can it lx  --  , Philip ! ' Rubbing his hand across his lips , he asked scornfully : ' Who 's even applied for a pardon ? I know I have n't . What 's the use , anyhow ? ' Philip looked at William Charlton . ' You 've applied for a pardon , William , I believe , ' he began , tentatively . ' Who else ? ' asked Toombs Dickerson , speaking suddenly from his place next to Gavin . ' Let 's get this straight . ' He searched the circle anxiously . ' Nobody , except William ? Well , then , ' he concluded , ' William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his eye roamed from one man to the next . ' Had n't we all better start trying to get on the amnesty list ? ' he demanded . ' Oh ! yes , ' he said , hotly , getting up and moving about with long , restless strides , ' I know . I 'd rather drink poison myself , but who 's going to run this country if we let ourselves get ctuhred out of our votes ? They 're certain as hell to keepp265right on thinking o ' slick ways to keep us away from the polls . ' He swung around on one heel and faced his friends , and the firelight accentuated the heavy creases around his mouth and eyes . Do n't you see ? ' he demanded harshly . We 've got to be slicker than they are . Whatever they ask us to swear , we 've got to swear , even if it 's to deny our own names ! ' He stood looking at them while his face set in a cold , hard mask , out of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how . We 've got to hold office , no matter how . That 's the long and short of it . General Lee 's told us that , ' he concluded abruptly . I nominate William Charlton as delegate . ' Lavin leaned over and touched his father . Even the Yankees must know Cousin William was n't raring to secede , like the rest of us . ' Philip nodded and rose to his feet . I hope you 'll accept , William . ' John McGaughey conferred with his brother and stood up . His body swayed vigorously , as he expressed his mind , pounding his broad fist into his open hand . He was never one to hesitate , but acted instantly on his first conviction . If you will , ' he declared , turning to William with his eyes snapping , my cowhands 'll roll up the German vote for you , and the Yankees are dead certain to let anybody through wit ( , ' s got a name you ca n't pronounce . Jesus Christ ! ' he thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Disgustedly he ran his heavy fingers through his abundant hair till it stood up r at mind his angry face like a halo . You 'll have to run ,  --  Vi limn , ' he concludedabruptly , whether you want to or not . ' My friends , ' began William , rising , as little as I welcome this responsibility at my age , when a man naturally craves rest , yet if you think I should take it , I accept it , in your name . Of course , there 's not a dog 's chance we 'll win , '  | Judge White answered him in his calm , deep voice . They 'll probably unseat you at the convention , William , even if you should get elected , ' he agreed , with a slight smile on his lips . Just as they are now preparing to fill my office with a loyalist  --  a former bartender , I am told . ' He spoke entirely without rancor , but as he looked around the circle , the smile suddenly left his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rememberwe may all be in jail this time next week . ' One trouble at a time , one trouble at a time , ' said Mr. Tripp Cuttross firmly . I 've found that a good rule in life . ' Rising as he spoke , he gestured toward the house . This is a party , gentlemen , not a misery meeting . I propose we join the ladies . ' Turning , he addressed Gavin . You young rascal , where 'd you find such a charming wilt ? She 's an ornament to the county , much too good Tiff you , sir , much too good . ' Of course , ' said Cavin . That 's true , sir . ' He smiled . I 've told her so myself . ' No man 's good enough for a woman , when it comes down to it , ' Mr. Spurlock exclaimed heartily . Philip spoke to Matt , who passed around another tray , this time of small thimble-sized glasses . They all stood up , waiting for Philip 's signal . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our mothers , and , ' he smiled at the young men , our sweethearts . ' Still his glass was high . God save the South . ' I Ie drained his cup and sighed . Calhoun put it another way , on his deathbed , do you remember , gentlemen ?  --  " The South , the poor South , I do n't know what will become of her . " ' Some of the young people who were due at Judge Symington 's ball in Berryville left early ; and , toward midnight , William and : a few others who lived close by went home . A good many , how/ever , planned to stay all night , for Philip 's friends took it for granted that any who found it convenient to sleep at his house would find extra cots and mattresses laid out for their convenience . If it was a good day , and the mood seized them , there might be good shooting tomorrow , perhaps the next day too . As the night wore on , however , it seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants had come up from the quarters to finish up the barbecued beef , and , a little later , the fiddlers and dancers among them had appeared in Philip 's drive , to amuse his guests . Then , when the musicians had retired , the conversations and reminiscences began  --  conversations which Philip well knew might keep up till any hour . He yawned behind his hand . He was sleepy and tired , and suddenly he wished his guests were . He glanced at the stars . At this rate it would be daylight before he got to bed . He yawned again . Cavin could do the honors from now on , he decided . At sixty-five a man needed his rest . He slipped off to his own room , and dropped asleep instantly . Soon afterward. the guests began one by one to follow his example.  |p268PovEY  gave himself no chance to change his mind about going to judge Symington 's ball . Early the next morning after his midnight conversation with the Bishop , he called in his colored boy , Horace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his softest boots . He asked Aunt Cindy to wash and iron a white pleated shirt he had in his trunk , and to another servant he gave the task of polishing his saddle and of currying and rubbing down his dappled roan , Xantlius . When he was dressed and ready , it was the middle of the morning . The dance was not until evening , but he decided to leave early , for he had business to transactin town  --  wines and brandies to order at Horst and La Farque 's , a pair of mules to look over at Heilschmidt 's Livery , and a matter to take up with judge White . He got on his horse , and threw an appraising glance at Horace . Yes , he was turned out very well in one of Povey 's own discarded suits , with a broad black cravat , exactly like his master 's , knotted under his brown chin . They started off , riding along at an easy pace through the warm and sunny autumn morning , following a narrow one-way road that dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordered by tall bushes bearing many long black pods . ' Coffee beans ! ' thought Povey , leaning over to strip the bushes as he rode by them . Black jaundice ! '  |p269The  two ideas naturally followed one another in immediate succession , for it was common knowledge that in the years when the coffee beans were thickest , black jaundice was most common . No one guessed , however , that the rain which nourished the bushes also provided extra fine breeding holes for the striped gray mosquitoes which distributed malaria impartiallybetween black and white alike , sparing only those liberally dosed with quinine . They began to meet travellers mounted on sleek animals , or riding in light gigs behind high-stepping horses , all on their way to Locust Hill , Povey knew . Passing them , he reflected that in no other Southern state  --  certainly in none where Sherman or Sheridan had been --  would it have been possible to come across so many good horses in a single morning . The reflection took his mind back to Virginia , where , when the war came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the pride of the Southern army ; but in the end , he had stayed with Terry 's Texans , who would never even so much as try to keep their horses ' necks in line . They had more important things to think about , their officers said ; and , after their first engagements , even General Lee agreed that they had . Povey began to smile , remembering how , once at a review in Richmond , Wade Hampton had had to throw his Carolinians between the hot-tempered Texans and the crack Virginia tronhs who were supposed to be demonstrating near perfection in drill and accoutrement . Well , he 'd never regretted his decision , though he knew if his mother had been alive , she would never have understood it . All that was long ago , though , he reminded himself ; and now he was riding not into Richmond , but into Berryville , Texas . The nearer he arrived there , however , the less inclined he felt to carry out the purpose he had so suddenly formed the night before . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . It had been a long time since he had whirled around a polished floor with a pretty girl on his arm . His delicate nostrils dilated . The last time he had escorted a young lady to a ball , he was still young and foolish enough to believe that a man might expect to be happy in this world . Since then , there had been no dances for him  --  only marches , victories , retreats , and finally capture at the battle of Green River , where the Texans had fallen row upon row in a charge so hopeless that other veteran troops had refused even to attempt it . He shook his head impatiently . How long , he wondered , did it take a man to learn to stop thinking about the war ? He might as well get on with his life , he thought with an ironic smile . There seemed to be a good deal of it left , as men counted time  --  that strange mystery in which they lived and breathed , like fish in water , never knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way a man felt , a second sometimes stretched out to feel like hours ; or , again , some'iines  --  especially if you were happy  --  an hour shrivelled down to a second . Well , for him , at least , there was not apt to be much shrivelling of hours , he thought , with a certain wry amusement . When they rode into the village , it was almost deserted . Later on , some of the young people who had spent the afternoon at Philip 's party would come riding in to dance at Judge Symington 's , but at present the streets were empty . The square , once optimistically planted in grass , was now littered with paper , and the hedge around it was neglected and scraggly . Along one side of it , there was a long row of black hitching posts , with horses ' heads at their tops , and to these Povey and 1IOrace tied their horses . After reminding Horace to keep a sharp eye on Xanthus and to feed and water him well at the livery stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p271You  know where the servants are dancing , do n't you , Horace ? ' he inquired . Across the creek , in the old cotton shed ? ' Yas-suh . ' Horace 's white teeth gleamed . He knew all right . Lawd ! How dat black gal of Judge Symington 's set his heart to jumping . Povey reached in his pocket . You 'll want to treat Sally to plenty of frozen custard , I suppose . ' He turned an adamant eye on his servant . And do n't you get to drinking so much beer that you forget to bring Xanthus around at one o'clock sharp . If you do , ' he warned Horace , I 'll have you beat in an inch o ' yo ' life . ' Horace grinned again , amiably and expansively . No-suh . Yas-suh , ' he promised Povey . I gwine-a be right dar when yo ' steps out'n de do ' . You see ern I ai n't . ' You will , if you know what 's good for you , ' Povey said severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipped Horace another coin . No use telling you to lay off craps , I suppose , Horace , but try to hold onto your front teeth . ' Laughing , he turned down the street toward the wine house where he traded . Horace , he knew , would bet the shirt off his back . He had a good deal of business to look over at Judge White 's office , and so much talking to carry on with Miss Clarissa , who invited him to supper , that it was long after dark belbre he left for Judge Symington 's square , red-brick house . It stood well back in a wide yard full of stubby grass , rosebushes , and glossy magnolia trees . A damp herring-bone walk , thickly shaded by cedar trees and crepe myrtles , led from the entrance gate to the high flight of white steeps by which one entered the front door . Judge Symington 's grandfather , on arriving in South Carolina from England , had expected to have his kitchen in his basement , where he had had it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the top soil for basementsin the country to which he had come , he had quite simply built his cellar on top of the ground , instead of under it , left his kitchen where his ancestors had had it , and provided a rising flight of steps up to his front door , with its long sidelights . His grandson continued the practice in Texas and also kept the title that he had acquired in Carolina  --  how , no one had ever thought to inquire . On the Brazos he raised cotton and corn and left the law to his neighbor and fellow Carolinian , Judge White . Still , everybody called him Judge , agreeing that if he did n't actually sit on the bench , there was no reason at all why he could n't . Povey made his way up the walk and pulled the brass knocker out as far as it would go - the knocker delicately molded into the shape of a squirrel , which , in the bronze , seemed almost as lithe and eager as the agitated little animals climbing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tails . As he waited , he heard a young girl 's voice in the parlor and wished he had stayed home . He was too old , he thought , to dance with a girl who had a voice like that  --  a child 's voice , almost . Too old to dance with anybody , ' he said soberly to himself . Well , he would leave early . " Though I suppose Horace wo n't welcome the idea , ' he smiled . A servant opened the door , and ushered him into a large , square room , with a very high ceiling , where Judge Symington stood , with his wife , and his two nieces in front of French windowsopening out into the raised gallery . As he entered , a few young couples were already testing out , on the polished floor , the steps of the schottische , and the negro musicians were tuning up . ' I hardly dared hope you would come , my dear Povey , ' Mrs.p273Symington said , laying her hand lightly on his coat-sleeve . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been doing since the war . It 's high time all of us thought of something else  --  if we can , ' she added sighing . Harriet Symington was a plump little woman , with tiny feet and hands , and only lately , at fifty-five , had she given up struggling to keep a tiny waist also . Her husband was well over six feet , with a fine head of flowing gray hair and a beard that he kept carefully clipped . He had lost an arm riding , like Povey , with the Terry Rangers , but he seemed never to notice its absence . He waited till his wife and his nieces were occupied with their guests . Then he drew Povey aside , using a significant tone and glance to stress the importance of his few , low words . Maybe it 'd be good sense , Povey , for you to go around and see that none of the men have left their pistols in their saddle-bags ? ' ' I ' 11 check up , ' Povey agreed instantly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guests began arriving more rapidly , and by nine o'clock the dance was in full swing . Young ladies in tarlatan , with flowers behind their ears , moved across the lighted windows as lightly as though they had never heard of a war ; and young gentlemen who , until recently , had stumbled wearily along on muddy roads stained with blood , now stepped across a polished floor as gracefully as though they had never lifted aching feet , or shouldered a gun . The music sank and rose , rose and sank again , and as the gay young couples whirled by , Povey began inure and more to feel that he did not belong where he was . There 's no use , ' he told himself ; not the slightest . Why am I here ? I 'll get Horace and start home . '  |p274Just  then , the long clock struck twelve , the dining-room doors were thrown open , and Judge Symington 's houseboy , Franklin , began ringing a bronze bell with a long handle  --  the same bell the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served on the same long table at the customary hour of midnight . There was a buzzing of many voices , as the couples entered the room . Syllabub ! ... Pecan cake ! ... Beaten biscuit ! ... Chicken salad ! .. . Um-m-m ! Jelly pie ! . .. And sweet-potato pone ! .. Franklin , which of these sandwiches do you recommend ? .. . That 's what I said , honey-angel . .. Blackberry wine ! ... Custard . . . More syllabub ? ' Upstairs in the hall a few negro maids peered over the bannisters , but most of them were dancing in the cotton shed , where those upstairs would soon take their turn at swinging around its rough floor . After supper the musicians had scarcely picked up their instruments when suddenly they laid them down , and the dancers stood still on the floor , tautly listening . In the distance , they could hear a loud confusion coming nearer  --  a confusion of shouts , and shrieks , and galloping hoofbeats mingled oddly with running human feet . It was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise his voice above its natural tone . Ladies , upstairs , please . ' He ran his eyes coolly around the room , where , the dancers were standing motionless in their places . Tarrant , kindly take the staircase . Gordon , to the 1 ) , n k , if you please . Goodwin '  --  he turned to his nephew  --  ' t he rest of you to the front gallery . I 'll go to the gate . Franklin , ' he ordered his servant , put out the lamps . '  |p275There  was not a sound except the swish of their skirts as the girls moved upstairs , gathering around their hostess in the wide hall at the top of the flight . There , my dears , do n't bother ! ' she said easily . Sit down . The men will manage , of course . It is pleasant to have you here with us tonight . We must have more parties . ' Stooping , she calmly arranged a displaced curl on one of the girls ' heads . Lavender , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorena . ' Her pleasant-blue eyes moved over the group . Do n't be alarmed . I am quite certain Judge Symington will know what to do . ' The girls sat on the floor , in a close circle , as quiet as death , not moving or uttering a sound . As they listened , they heard a rising murmur of excited voices in the hall below them . Mas ' Tarrant ! . . . Dey 's atter us ! Dey 'll kill us all . . . Mas ' Goodwin ! Mas ' Goodwin ! ... Lawd Jesus he'p us ! ... ' Then several negro girls came stumbling up the stairs to their mistresses , panting and crying , gray with fright . Before they could calm themselves enough to tell what had happened , Mrs. Symington heard a negro answering Judge Symington 's sharp questions . Peering out into the dark through the upstairs window , she held her breath . She could barely see her husband 's erect figure behind his swinging gate , in front of which stood three colored soldiers . Officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind them , other shadows were moving and surging in restless confusion . Listening intently , she heard the Judge warning the soldiers not to come a step closer . They stopped , irresolute . There were not many of them in this party , for their group had scattered in several directions . They were all halfdrunk , but not too drunk to realize the mat- ter had gone farther than any of them had planned when they entered the cotton shed intending merely to drag off a negro girl for each soldier . They had not expected the negro men to resist ; nor , least of all , had they expected them all to rush pellmellto their white masters . Then , when it had become clear that that was exactly what they were doing , the soldiers had decided it might be amusing to break up a white dance , too . Now , they were beginning to wonder whether that idea had not been , perhaps , somewhat overambitious . For a minute , while Mrs. Symington heard her heart beat , the three soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she heard another negro voice . Horace had dashed into the yard , hunting for Povey , and , seeing what was going on , now rushed over to the Judge . It was his girl , Sally , Mrs. Symington 's maid , who had caught the colored captain 's eye as he rode past the cotton shed . Kill ' im , Jedge , kill ' irn ! ' Horace shrieked . Dey 's run off wid my Sally . ' Hearing Horace 's voice , Povey swung around sharply , addressingthe Judge 's nephew , Goodwin Breekinridge . Goodwin ! ' he exclaimed . ' That 's my boy , Horace ! ' Already , as he spoke , he was halfway down the walk . Emboldened by Povey 's and the Judge 's presence , Horace suddenly leaped over the fence and knocked one surprised black soldier to the ground . Immediately , the other two fell upon him and dragged him off their companion , striking him furiously about the head with their pistol butts . Without an instant 's hesitation , Povey flung open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he commanded them , in a low , abrupt voice . The negro soldiers were unaccustomed to men who dropped their voices when they expected to be obeyed . Therefore , instead of turning Horace loose , they began kicking him with their heavyp277boots and , at the same moment , put out their hand for the gate , thinking themselves fully covered by the soldiers behind them . But their support had had considerable experience in Texas and , the moment they saw one of their leaders on the ground and all the white men drawn up on the porch , they decided it was time to retreat to the garrison . Hurriedly , before anybody was aware of their intention , they turned their horses and galloped off . The two colored soldiers , however , pushed forward as Horace scrambled up and bounded to his master 's side , shaking but determined . Laved Jesus ! Gim me a gun an ' lemme at ' em ! ' he gasped . The soldiers , the Judge saw , were too drunk for caution . All right , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped in their tracks . The men on the gallery closed in , as Povey and Horace stooped to disarm the men who lay , cursing , on the ground . Leaning over them also , the Judge looked up at Horace , smiling wryly . You put one of ' em to sleep all right , boy , ' he exclaimed , stooping more closely over the other two . It 's nothing , ' he said and glanced at Povey . We intended only to stop them . ' Standing erect , he looked gravely around the circle of men . I suppose we ought to take them back to the garrison . ' There 's a bare chance the new white officer there may be responsible . ' As he spoke , they all heard a renewed clanking of sabres and hurried marching , and realized that the soldiers who had gallopedaway had returned , this time with reinforcements . The Judge again stepped to his gate , and Povey and Goodwin Breckinridge fell in beside him . Seeing that the white officer did not draw his pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , however , told them why he was so negligent . He was swaying on his feet , but his eyes flashed dangerously . Two pompous colored lieutenants stood silently beside him , holding lanterns . I request you , sir , to remove your men from my premises , ' Judge Symington said curtly . The shifting yellow light of the lanterns threw his massive head into sharp relief against the night . Who shot my men ? Who shot ' em ? ' the officer roared . His round face was red and apoplectic , his voice furious . I 'm Major Richards , and I 'll jail every damned white man in this crowd unless I find out . ' The men in the yard stepped closer , but Judge Symington dropped his pistol into its holster and held up his hand . Gesturingcontemptuously toward the officer , whose brain appeared to be clearing somewhat under the night air , he reminded his friends that the only authority operative in the state was standing there in front of them . Stepping forward , then , he eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , that I wounded these drunken criminals '  --  he inclined his head slightly toward the negroes at his foot  --  who trespassed on my property and abused my servants . I give you fair warning , I 'll kill the next ones who put foot on my land . ' And this is my negro , ' said Povey , pointing to Horace . Your men have made off with his girl , and God knows what they 've done with her . I shot one of your drunken cowards there , and I 'll shoot the next one that steps in my path . ' The patience of the officer in charge of the troops was exhausted . He had not the slightest understanding of the people with whom he was dealing . Putting out his hand , he yanked the Judge around . Come along , now , ' he said , and spoke curtly to the coloredp279soldiers at his side . Take ' em both on down to the garrison . ' At the words , all the men in the yard suddenly fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get out of this yard and get out quick , ' Goodwin Breckinridgewarned him . The Major was taken off guard ; he had thought the sight of so many armed soldiers would prevent any resistance . He had not even pulled his gun ; and , as his brain cleared in the cool night air , he realized that the soldiers drawn up outside the fence were awaiting his order , would not fire without it . Taking a look at Goodwin Breckinridge 's face , he decided not to give the order . March your men back to the garrison double quick , ' Goodwincommanded crisply . And do n't waste any time about starting , either . ' The Major hesitated , but not for long . He was beginning to see his course . He had been firmly instructed at Galveston that , if he wished to fatten his purse as his predecessor had done , he must refrain from stirring up bloodshed . The citizens , he had been assured , were prepared to pay well for peace . And was n't money what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a moment to make up his mind . Then he removed his hand from the Judge 's arm and ordered his colored bodyguard to pick up their wounded comrades and return with them and the troops outside to their posts . Goodwin Breckinridge waited until they had turned the cornertwo blocks away before he stepped forward and addressed the Major . Now , ' he said calmly , we can talk turkey . Come to think of it , ' he added slowly , might not be a bad idea to hold you , ourselves . ' Eyeing the officer with extreme and obvious distaste , he considered the prospect with pleasure . Only , GodP280knows , I 'd hate to associate that long with a skunk like you . ' I 'd thought of that plan myself ; but we 'd better give it up , ' said Judge Symington regretfully . It would prejudice our case . ' Case ? ' Goodwin blinked at his uncle . Yes , ' repeated the Judge calmly . That 's exactly what I mean , Goodwin . Do n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out whether there are any courts operating in this stateany courts of justice , that is , ' he argued in a steady , restrained voice . A murmur of dissent began to spread through the gathering , when Povey raised his hand to silence it . I think the Judge is right , ' he said firmly . More is involved than our personal fortunes . Do n't you see that , gentlemen ? ' he pleaded , supporting the Judge 's decision . How can we demandthe restoration of law and order in this county , and refuse to submit ourselves to the only visible constituted authority ? ' When you think it over , ' continued Judge Symington , taking up the argument , ' you will all agree with us . ' He stood facing the group , judging their reaction by their silence . Then whirlingon his heel , he addressed the Federal officer sharply . We are at your service , sir . ' Might n't it be a good idea , ' Povey suggested dryly , to find out right now how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board the prisoners . I presume that is the point you are interested in , sir ? ' he said , turning to the Major . Now they were talking sensibly , that officer concluded . He ran over several possible figures in his mind , but he had a certain canny sagacity that warned him what was possible and what was not . They would likely pay more , if the matter was left unsettled and they were allowed to make a free-will offering , weekly.  |p281Whatever  you hand me every Monday morning , gentlemen , will be applied to the comfort of the prisoners , ' he assured them . Gentlemen ! That was a word they seemed to be fond of ; he must remember to use it , as the Judge was already doing , with a kind of easy , intimate warmth in his tone . Well , gentlemen , ' said Judge Symington , my thanks to you all . Tarrant , will you be good enough to hand a note to my wife ? ' Moving over to the steps , he sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope he took from his pocket . Rising , he addressed the blue-coated officer as pleasantly as if they were starting off together for a short stroll . Shall we be starting , sir ? ' Of course , ' Povey broke in , Sally must be returned . ' Sally ? ' the Major inquired . Your men ran off with her , ' Povey bluntly informed him . Sally , the Judge 's housemaid . ' The Major took time to think about that demand . My men ' he began , shaking his head . How much ? ' Povey inquired tartly , without wasting words . I have already instructed my wife to '  --  Judge Symington bowed and cleared his throat  --  to sufficiently reward the soldier who brings her back . ' Very good , very good indeed , ' the Major commented . I t. was becoming clearer and clearer to him that he had been %cell advised at Galveston . Still , he could n't understand t these people at all . He threw a suspicious glance at the Judge and I'ovey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , walking along to the jail with him as politely as you please  --  , and of their own free will , too , asking him what kind of crops they grew , up where he came from . Nobody at Judge Symington 's closed an eye , but as night wore on , it began to look as though the soldiers were sleeping off their spree . By daybreak , the men on guard began to feel their tension relaxing  --  too soon , however , they discovered . Jackson Tarrant was standing with his long arm raised against the pillars of Judge Symington 's high porch , when he caught sight of a flame leaping around the corner of a building that faced the square , two short blocks away . Then he smelt the sharp odor of burning pine . The horses ! ' he thought instantly , his dark , sleepy eyes suddenlyspringing open . They 're all tied down by the square . ' Gordon ! ' He spoke quietly to the man next him . I 'm going down to the square a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' 11 come along . ' His round face was boyish , but not his eyes , for , though he was barely twenty-one , he had been at Gettysburg and Cold Harbor . They crept along , hiding themselves in every shadow . It took only a glance for them to see that the horses were gone from the square . Cox had raised his cream-colored mare , Butterfly , on a bottle , from a colt . He began to swear incessantly , tingling from head to toe , racked with the anger that had been gathering in him all night . Butterfly 's back would be full of sores , if he ever found her again . But soon he had more to think about than a horse 's back . For flames were beginning to roar around the square ; and soldiers were running in and out the smoke applying fresh torches wherever the fire seemed to be dying down . The air was thick and choking , and sparks were flying everywhere  --  like Roman candles bursting at Christmas , Cox suddenly thought . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed . There was no breeze , however . Swiftly Cox and Jackson calculated the chances . It did not seem likely , unlessp283the soldiers also began setting fire to the residences , that the flames would leap the empty square . But the garrison where the Judge and Povey were ! ' Do you reckon they 'll fire that , too ? ' whispered Cox . ' No , I do n't think so , ' Jackson whispered back , flattening himself against the wall around which he peered . It 's a good ways out , and the wind 's the other way . ' ' Right ! ' agreed Cox . We 'd better get back . ' As soon as they stepped on the gallery , they realized affairs had taken a more serious turn . There , in deathly stillness , stood the men they had left , surrounding Goodwin Breckinridge 's servant , Aaron  --  a tall , slim black who , breathless and panting , was trying to tell his story . Aaron , like Horace , was in love with Sally , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he saw a colored soldier dashing out of the hall with her , Aaron had rushed outdoors , and mounted the first horse he came to . It took him some moments to find a mount , however , and in the confusion he lost track of the man he was after . He rode aimlessly around the town and out into the side roads and into the woods for hours , it seemed to him , looking for the officer who had carried his girl away . He would know him , anywhere . Finally , it occurred to him that if he would hang around the garrison , as many negroes did , he might hear what had become of Sally . He put out of his mind the fact that he was on some white man 's horse . Plenty of black men were doing that nowadaysand getting away with it , too . He spurred his horse on , and had just drawn up in the shadows behind the guard-house when he saw Judge Symington and Povey entering it by the front door , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I be doggoned ! ' Aaron said , moving cautiously closer . ' EN it ai n't Mas ' Povey an ' Jedge Symington ! My Lawd !  | Whut kine o ' trouble is stackin ' up now ? ' Watching , he saw the officer set off for town again , alone . Aaron had a little money and soon fell into a crap game with the sentry on duty , who at intervals would break off the game and walk his beat , wandering in and out the prison house and the barracks . Aaron sat back and waited . He was ahead , so he had no doubt that the soldier would soon return . Sho look mighty deserted aroun ' heah , ' Aaron commented , carefully shaking his dice , when they had taken up their play after one of these interruptions . Ought to look deserted , ' the darky observed . Dey ai n't nobody heah hardly a-tall . ' Where is dey all ? ' said Aaron , innocently . The soldier chuckled . Lawd , nigger , de soljers is riflin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole place on fiah ; an ' dem whut ai n't in town is got Bair gals out in de woods . An ' heah I sets ! Got a mind to let out de niggers dey was gwine-a hang . ' Putting down his dice , he turned the possibility over in his thoughts . " Twould n't be no trick at all to do . Dat 'd leave jes ' dem two white men . Reckon dey might as well hang as not . ' The longer he thought about his idea , the better it seemed to please him . Ef'n I do n't make way wid ' cm , de udders will , soon 's dey gitt the firin ' de town . ' Aaron had heard enough . Mas ' Goodwin would help him get Sally out of the woods . He better hurry back , too , and tell him about Judge Symington and Mas ' Povey maybe getting hung . He tossed a few more throws and then rose lazily , stretching himself . The sentry , who had been winning for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was out of sight , he rode slowly . Then he put his horse to a frantic gallop , circled the blazing town , and came by a back route into Judge Symington 's yard.  |p285Cox  and Jackson had just stepped back on the porch when Aaron began his account . Goodwin listened to only a few sentences before he began to shuffle matches around in his hand . Draw ! ' he said , quietly stepping from man to man.  |p286THE  house was quiet when Philip woke suddenly , and looked at his watch . Half-past four , and the night was still bright with stars . What had wakened him ? His ear , attuned to a lifetime of listening , caught the sound of a horse 's galloping feet in his lane . He sat up , instantly awake . Then , certain of what 1w heard , he grabbed up his pistols and , hurrying down the stairs , stepped outside the door onto the gallery . Whose horse is that ? ' he asked himself , before he could see the rider 's face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal . Surely that was Povey 's mount , Xanthus , at his gate . In the dark , he saw a negro throw himself on the ground and run rapidly toward biro . Stop ! ' Philip 's voice was sharp . Who is it ? ' Horace , suh . Horace . Mas ' Povey 's boy , ' the darky panted . Mas ' William sont me ahead to tell you he gwine-a be along any minute now . ' I brace jumped at every moving shadow . I'se afeard dey 's gwine-a hang ' em , ' he quavered . Hang ' em ? ' Philip inquired , startled . Hang who ? What are you saying , boy ? ' He grasped the negro by the shoulder . Be quiet , ' he cautioned him . Do n't wake up the ladies . ' Then his thoughts began to take shape beneath his mounting anxiety . He watched Horace narrowly . Now , tell me ! ' he said , as soon as he saw the colored boy could speak coherently. 1p287Mas ' Povey an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dey 's gwine-a hang ' em , I reckon . Dey wuz a shootin ' , ' he gasped , an ' de soljers took ' em , an ' I lit out de back way to git Mas ' William . ' Philip pushed the shaking negro down the steps . Go back to the servants ' house , ' he commanded him , and tell Matt and Jake to saddle every horse in the barn , quick . ' As he swung open the front door , he saw Letitia standing there , just inside the hall . I heard a little , ' she said , holding him with her eyes . He could not spare her ; he knew that . Better get it over with . The soldiers have put Povey and Judge Symington in jail , ' he informed her , with pity in his voice . This boy says they 've threatened to hang them . ' He put out his hand , but she did not notice it . We 'll be leaving immediately , ' he finished . Still she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her firmly . It would be better for her to have something to do , something to focus her attention . Get my saddlebags , my pistols . Take them to Matt . Put in something for bandages and a bottle of brandy . Right away . Do you hear me , Lettie , do you hear ? I ca n't wait . ' She nodded , and , with an effort , repeated slowly after hi In , in a dead , automatic voice , Pistols . Bandages . Brandy . Yes , Philip , of course . ' Then he saw her quiver and heard her draw a long , slow breath . This minute , ' she added more firmly . Go ! ' She shoved him . Go ! ' Later , after William had galloped up with reinforcements , she stood peering out at the men assembled just outside the gate in the bleak , cold light of breaking dawn . Two or three of the ladies had waked up and were standing , tense and quiet , beside her . This was likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they listened in anxious , strained silence to the men 's low voices and to the sharp click of revolving cartridgebarrels . Gavin , ' Letitia heard Philip saying , I do n't think there 'll be any trouble here , but somebody 'll have to stay . I 'll ask you and David '  --  he chose rapidly  --  and the McGaughey and Dyess boys . The rest of us ' Before he could complete his sentence , the men were climbing on their horses and , in another moment , their saddles were creaking under them and their spurs clanking . Draw up under the big live-oak a mile from town , ' said William , taking the lead as Povey 's closest friend . If we meet any soldiers , fall behind your horses , and do n't fire unless I raise my arm . ' Letitia saw Philip whirl , dig his spurs into Pilot 's black sides , and be off , just as light began to brighten in the East . She stood at the window until the last hoofbeats died away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their necks stretched out , their cars laid back , and their manes flying , and the men leaning forward in their saddles , lifting their weight . Often Philip had had to dash off like that , in the middle of the night , to save a patient . Now he was galloping off to save Povey and  --  Letitia pushed her hair back off her face  --  she had forgotten even to tell him good-bye . Lucina opened the door and walked straight across the galleryto Cavin . I can hit a target , ' she told him steadily . Mrs. Dyess has her own pistols . Mrs. Spurlock has a box of red pepper . ' Red pepper ? ' Gavin raised his brows , smiling . Yes , ' Lucina nodded wisely . She says she 's going to throw it in anybody 's eyes that dares to touch her . ' Gavin began to laugh . My gosh ! that 's an idea , ' he chuckled.  |p289It  's a pity Hood did n't have some ladies on his staff ! ' Then suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sweet , ' he warned her , and stay inside that room . ' He pointed to where Letitia was standing . I do n't believe anything 's going to come up , ' he said slowly , but you ca n't tell what they may have up their sleeves . ' They sat there until full daylight , keeping guard  --  against what danger they did not know . Just boys ! ' Mrs. Dyess thought , watching them through the window . Just boys ! ' She turned to Miss Winnie Lee . Just sleepy boys ! And they 've fought a war ! ' She pointed through the blinds . See my two ! Sometimes , when I go to wake ' em up in the morning , I ca n't believe they 've been through what they have . ' Her voice broke and she looked at her friend , with slow tears welling up in her sad , gray eyes . But they 've been up Little Round Top , and buried their brother at its foot . What a world , Winnie Lee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ! ' Mrs. Kemper 's eyes followed her friend 's finger , and her own eyes blurred . Yes , ' her heart echoed , what a world ! ' ; but she did not trust herself to speak . What was there to say ? As William raced along the road now beginning to lighten ahead of him , with the men pounding beside him , he felt an exhilaration in definite action which the last hard months of marking time had taken from him . As day broke clearer , he saw that the man next to him was Povey 's servant , Horace , on Xanthus . The negro , catching William 's eye , pressed closer and cried questioningly above the clatter of the hoofbeats , ' Ern I rode in to town ahead , suh , dey might tell me Instantly William saw that it was a good plan . They had only a handful of men against a garrison of soldiers . It would be far wiser to draw up under the live-oak tree just outside of town and see what news Horace could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signified his assent . Hurry back , as quick as you can , to the big live-oak at the fork of the road , a mile from town , ' he told the negro . If we ca n't wait there , ' he warned him , we 'll be at the garrison . ' God only knew what they 'd find going on , when they got nearer , he thought . Horace nodded in quick understanding . Yas-suh . I better take de swamp road , and cut acrost to de back o ' town , ' he calculated , and was off as quickly as he spoke , disappearing into the fog that enveloped the low bottom land . But long before they reached the tree , William saw they could not pause under it . Some miles back , he had caught the smell of ' smoke in the air , but had laid it to a prairie fire . Now he knew he had been mistaken , for great clouds of smoke were pouring in acrid gusts down the road from Berryville . My God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGaughey exclaiming and saw the other men draw up a moment , in horror , and then dash on at redoubled speed . Swiftly he recast his plans . The sky seemed ablaze , as they came out of the wooded road into the clear stretch leading to the village . The yellow smoke drifting across the bushes burned their throats and stung their eyes . Already the heat had caused their horses to turn their heads ; and when the sparks began flying thickly around them , they became almost unmanageable , nickering in fright and rearing , with the white foam pouring off their legs . The garrison was now in plain sight , on the edge of town . William 's mind worked quickly . The best plan , he thought , P291would be to hide the horses in the thicket off the road , leaving two or three men to guard them . The rest would proceed on foot , in small groups , at least as far as the guard-house . They would be less noticeable that way than on horseback , and in the confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He jerked out his watch . Two hours and a half since they had left Locust Hill . He had thought the route impossible to cover in less than three . He signalled for the men to draw up and explained his idea , asking for suggestions . Several of the men had already considered the same possibility . They got down , speaking in short , jerky sentences , under their breath , tied their horses , and separated . Proceeding cautiously , they made their way by twos and threes , cutting through the thicket that lay parallel to the strangely empty road . But at the garrison they halted , dumbfounded , in front of an open door . There was no one about ; the barracks were deserted ; even the fires were out in the kitchen . They might have been ghosts walking around an empty battle field . What had been going on there ? Philip glanced at his companions ' faces and saw that he was not alone in the sudden , dreadful certainty which took possession of him . Laying a plank slantwise against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was about to climb up it and reconnoitre , when he felt a hand pulling at his sleeve . Horace had managed to slip through the town , and was on his way back to the appointed place , when , passing t he garrison , he saw that Philip and his friends were already there . Xanthus'sreins were drawn through Horace 's arm , and the negro 's brown skin looked gray and ashen . Mas ' Philip , ' he implored , you-all ai n't got a minute to spare . ' His face was contorted and his eyes were twitching . The other men pressed close , to hear what he was saying.  | Dey was gon na hang some niggers this mawnin ' , ' Horace repeated , his eyes moving in jerks from face to face , until hefound William 's  --  some niggers ' He stopped and began to explain to William , I met some soljers , lak I tol ' you Yes , yes , ' William hurried him on . Where 's your master ? Did n't you find that out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was-sub , yas-suh , ' Horace waved a trembling hand toward the bayou . Dey tuhned de niggers loose , and dey 's plannin ' on hangin ' Mas ' Povey an ' Jcdge Symington in dair place . ' He was climbing on Xanthus as he spoke . William put out a swift hand and pulled him back . Get up behind me , ' he commanded him , and dug his spurs into Xanthus 's dripping sides . ' Horace 'll bring out your horses , ' he called back to the men on foot . They followed as fast as they could down the deserted road back to the thicket , grabbing their reins from Horace . Across the fields , they could see , galloping furiously ahead , William and the men who had been left to guard the horses . They followed , spurring their mounts over the low rail fence . William'sparty , they saw , was floundering in wet , red mud , and they , therefore , swung their own horses to the right , up a slight incline where the ground looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across deep furrows , where a horse could easily stumble and break a leg ; and then out of that field into a mule pasture cut with gullies ; and at last , there in front of them , was the bayou flowing thick and red with mud stirred up by autumn rains . William plunged in first , and his horse 's head went under . Up it came , and the creature snorted , shaking his mane clear . Now Philip was in . Pilot laid his delicate ears back and swam ahead with long , sure strokes . Soaked to the waist , they allp293scrambled up the slippery bank , making for the cut through the woods , where hangings were always carried out . They knew the place  --  a dark , sinister , open spot curtained by gray , swinging moss , and surrounded by trees with long , straight-spreading limbs . The negroes would not go past it by night ; and now , as Horace thought of the dark , haunted circle , he pressed closer to William . They galloped on through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers are drunk , we can probably scatter them , ' William thought , but he knew they could make no plan . Each rider would have to rely on his own wits . The trees were thinning now , and through a cleared space , William caught a glimpse of soldiers  --  how many he could not exactly determine  --  around two other men on horseback . Now , he could see a little better , and he made a rough estimate . There did not seem to be over forty or fifty men under the trees . There were , he supposed  --  he had not counted them  --  eighteen or twenty in their own group . Probably most of the soldiers were in town looting and burning it , he thought . Suddenly , strangled sounds of which he was hardly conscious began to roll out of his throat . There in front of him  --  for t hr first time he could see clearly through the trees  --  was a new dangling rope , but  --  his eyes bored through the brushswinging free . Yes ! thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his spurs with all his strength , and out of the corner of his eyes saw Philip tearing the bowie knife that always hung on his saddle out of its case . It was sharp as a razor , he knew . Only last week he had helped Philip whet it , himself . The men behind him closed in . There , not a hundred yards away now , sat Povey and Judge Symington , on horseback . Povey 's hands were tied behind him , and , Judge Symington 's one arm roped to the pommel of his saddle . Their shirts were hanging in strips , torn off their backs . Hearing the crashing in the bushes they both turned their heads to see what was happening ; and , seeing , took instant action . Povey struck his horse 's flanks sharply with his heavy boots , just as Philip raced by , knocking over a guard and , in a single sure movement , cutting the ropes that bound his hands together . William missed Judge Symington 's bridle and seized hold , instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the briefest momentaryslackening of speed , the rest of the men charged upon the colored soldiers , breaking , as they galloped , into the shrill , high piercing yell that had scattered the Yankees at Manassas . These black soldiers had never heard that sharp yell before , but something in its fierce , wild cadence terrified them . They were dismounted , all of them , and more than half drunk . The sight of these galloping , plunging horses , with their bold , furious riders , was too much for them . Taking to cover , they disappeared in the woods , as if devils were after them . Letting them go , the riders nu et ! on after William and Philip , this time boldly coming out on the main road . They met no one . The soldiers were in town , their commanderdrunk and asleep on the saloon floor . On and on they galloped . Suddenly William remembered a narrow path to the left of the road , which led to an old Indian fort , long ago abandoned . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ground where the gunpowder had been stored . He turned and the rest followed . There they could safely draw up , he thought . Their horses came to a sharp halt , their back legs bending and their front feet coming up in the air , their breaths escaping in long , tearing gasps . Mr. Archibald Bland , not on his mule this time , but on one of Philip 's horses , got down , walked over to Judge Symington , and untied the Judge 's hand from his pommel.  |p295Well  , I be doggoned , Judge , ' he said casually . You did n't ride with the Rangers for nothing . ' Judge Symington 's face was pallid , and his eyelids twitched , but he straightened his shoulders , and looked at his friends calmly . My gratitude , gentlemen , ' he said , in a warm , steady voice . My very deep gratitude , indeed . ' Then a quizzical expression crossed his face . I trust that none of you will ever be in a position to require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand , but he waved it away , and , unassisted , swung his stiff legs to the ground . Philip felt in his saddlebags and walked silently over to the Judge and Povey . Without a word , he unscrewed the silver top of his flask , filled it with brandy , and offered it first to Judge Symington , then to Povey . The Judge took it at once and sipped it slowly , as the color returned to his cheeks ; but Povey stood looking for a long minute straight at Philip , who returned his gaze without a flicker of his eyelashes . Then , suddenly , Povey turned the cup up and swallowed its contentsin one impetuous gesture . Handing it back to Philip with a slight , formal bow , he began swinging his arms . This is a pleasant surprise , gentlemen , I assure you  --  a very pleasant surprise . By now , I had confidently expected to be trying out my wings . ' He sat down on the low , mud wall of the old fort , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed against his horse 's wet sides . Then his gaze fell on Horace standing in the background , energetically rubbing Xanthus clown , and he looked over toward William , a sudden idea crossing his mind . That 's where Horace went to , then . And he 'd been ready to break his bones ! William met his eyes and nodded . Horace woke me up before day . '  |p296Povey  got up and walked straight over to his servant . Horace , ' he said , clapping him on the shoulder and turning him around in his tracks , as , somewhat abashed , the negro returned his gaze . I reckon there 's nothing I 've got , boy , you ca n't have . ' You remembers dat time in de army when you jumped in an ' pulled me out de ribber ? ' asked Horace . Well , suh , ' he said , looking straight at Povcy , I ai n't done no mo ' fur you , no mo ' at all . ' Then he handed his master the reins he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , suh ? ' he asked . The horse , recognizing Povey , nipped playfully at his sleeve . Judge Symington stood up . William , ' he decided , I 've got to get on home . God knows what 's happened there since one o'clock last night . Apparently they ca n't even control their own troops . ' He threw a tentative , inquiring glance at his friends . Perhaps , though , gentlemen , it would be wiser for you to scatter , ' he suggested . For answer , Povey sprang on Xanthus , and William on his horse . Philip spurred Pilot until he was just behind the Judge , and the others pushed through the underbrush after him . Their horses ' knees were caked with mud , their nostrils dilated . Over ditches , into gullies and up again , through the slough , past the Judge 's cornfield , out by his pasture  --  there at last was his white back fence in sight , on the edge of the village from which black smoke still poured sickeningly out in hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , and Philip grabbed his saddlebags . The Judge paused a second on the back gallery . Aaron , Franklin , blanket the horses , walk ' cm slowly about , and do n't let them drink for an hour . ' Then he was inside . Goodwin Breckinridge threw open the back door , but therep297was no time for questions or explanation . Goodwin had barely recognized his uncle and the men with him , when they all heard the same sound  --  not the uproarious rioting that had been going on for hours , not the crackling flames , but the steady tramp-tramp of disciplined , orderly feet , pausing again in front of the garden gate . I ' 11 go , ' said Goodwin , laying a restraining hand on his uncle 's arm . He did not know what had happened , but he saw that Judge Symington had been under heavy strain . The Judge smiled and shook off his hand . No , thank you , Goodwin , ' he said briefly , and strode firmly out to the gate , pausing only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she stood on the bottom stairstep unable to believe her eyes and her ears . Would this strange and terrible nightmare never pass ? She had thought the Judge was in jail . She stood rigid , clinging to the rail for support , and stared after him , in complete silence , understanding that this was no time for a man to have to stop and comfort his wife . The Judge walked down the path toward the gate , where he saw a group of white soldiers standing at ease behind two men in the foreground . Their officers , he supposed . Then as he drew nearer , he recognized one of the men . My dear Bishop ! ' he exclaimed , hardly believing his own eyes , and looking long and hard at his friend . Thank God ! ' exclaimed the Bishop , seizing the Judge 's hand and shaking it as his features brightened in relief . We 've been looking for you . ' He turned his head toward the officer at his side . Judge Symington , Major Bradford . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutation with cold precision , maintaining strict silence , as Major Bradford leaned across the gate , addressinghim in short , crisp sentences.  | Judge Symington , ' he began , the soldiers who have fired this village are as dastardly a bunch of renegades as I have seen under uniform . ' His cold blue eyes snapped , and he held his head , with its dark clipped sideburns , as high as the Judge 's own . They are a disgrace to the army in which I have the honor to serve , and I intend to see that not one of them escapes court-martial . In the name of the United States Government , sir , I apologize for their conduct . ' The Judge 's expression did not alter , and Major Bradford leaned closer . I have just had the pleasure of arresting a company of drunken cowards who had trussed up some of your young men '  --  he lifted his eyes and looked briefly over the group now assembled behind the , Judge  --  and left them in a building directly in the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The soldiers in question are under guard , and your friends should be along safely at any minute now . ' Ah ! ' said Goodwin , . cloud , breathing easier . That 's why they did n't come back . ' l le moved nearer the gate , as did the other men around him . The officer was still speaking , holding his steady gaze on the Judge 's attentive face . I had known Bishop Gregg well in a happier time , ' he was explaining in his harsh , precise accent , and I , therefore , wrote and asked him to confer with me about the administration of this county . We were talking together , when a young officer from this post galloped up asking for assistance in quieting this damnable outrage that our troops have committed here . ' For a moment , he stood silent , with his watchful eyes still on the fudge 's face , which , he saw , had taken on a somewhat less severe cast . I trust you will do me the honor , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . '  |p299That  , sir , ' replied the Judge promptly and decisively , is hardly necessary . ' The officer 's eyes lifted and dwelt on the group of determined faces drawn up behind the Judge . He saw that the men were all armed and , he judged , soldiers themselves , accustomed to handling their weapons . He addressedthem directly , raising his voice slightly . Gentlemen , ' he said clearly , I urge you to put up your guns , return home , and let me assume full responsibility for the restoration of order in this village . ' John McGaughey spoke hotly across the Judge 's shoulders , and the scorn in his rumbling voice brought a sudden flush to Major Bradford 's cheeks . Your infamous gang of horsethieves could n't be trusted to put a stop to a yellow-dog-fight , ' he taunted the Major , his huge voice leaping like a bullet across the space between him and the Northern officer . Besides , ' he went on , clapping his hands suddenly to his cartridge belt , we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large head as he spoke toward the Judge and Povey . The officer did not flinch . He moved forward and addressed Judge Symington . It is my disagreeable duty to inform you , sir , that you are again under arrest , you and '  --  he consulted a list he held in his hand  --  Mr. Povey Blount , and the other leaders of the group , who , I am happy to say , were successful in rescuing you . ' He paused and spoke emphatically to the men now gathered close around the Judge . The United States Government will condone no defiance of its authority in this province  --  none whatsoever . The sooner that fact is accepted in this state , the better for all concerned . ' His keen , cold eyes swept the gathering . John McGaughey sprang suddenly firward , with a furious lurching movement of his whole body , but the Judge put out his arm to stop him . I am at your service , sir , ' he informed the officer coolly . Permit me to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous precision , and the Bishop pulled open the gate and stepped inside the yard . Judge , ' he said quietly , laying his hand on his friend 's shoulder , you can accept Major Bradford 's word . ' The Judge returned his long glance , nodded twice , and stood silent , waiting for quiet . In a moment the yard was so still that , as the Judge began to speak , the Bishop could hear the sound of the squirrels scurrying among the oak leaves on the grass . Put down your guns , my friends , ' the Judge was saying in an unimpassioned , deliberate voice . This matter goes beyond any of our personal desires . ' Ile stopped , and the men who stood listening were conscious that his mind was made up . I said last night , ' he reminded them , that the issue was this : Is there any responsible , orderly government in this county ? I still think that is the question at stake , ' he concluded , his voice rising slightly . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am prepared to stand trial on the right of any American to defend his home and family from attack by a gang of drunken ruffians . ' His eye sought the Bishop 's . I will ask Bishop Gregg to see that the truth is laid before the Governor . ' And Sheridan , and the President , if need be , ' the Bishop replied , extending the list . I have already so informed Major Bradford . ' There was a moment 's quiet broken by Povey 's cool , mocking voice . Leaning slightly across the fence , he looked into the Major 's face with elevated brows and a disdainful smile on his lips.  |p301I  trust , sir , ' he inquired politely , that your prison accommodationsin this state excel those I enjoyed in Illinois ? ' He stepped back then , with a light , easy step , and the officer waited , with a frown between his brows . He would never understand these people , never . Were they never reasonable ? They laughed when he expected them to be serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A strange people , ' he thought , a strange people , ' and glanced out of the corner of his eye at the Bishop , remembering the advicehe had received from him that morning . Well , he supposed he had better try to hold his temper , if he could . John McGaughey could no longer contain himself . He strode forward and shook his large fist across the gate , under the officer 's very nose . His face was no longer red , but deadly pale , as it always grew when he became sufficiently angry  --  shooting mad , his cowboys said . I give you fair warning , ' he roared , any time your black baboons lay hands on us , they 'll get what they got this morning . ' His eyes glittered  --  like a rattlesnake 's , Philip suddenly thought  --  and his thick hair stood up around his white face . Do you think we 're going to let your god-damned bunch o ' hell-cats go on hanging our men and kidnapping our women ? ' Ile stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , with his finger raised as a signal to Major Bradford . John , ' said William , speaking quietly , without a flicker in his calm , blue eyes , John , you 're wasting your fire . ' lie laid his hand firmly on his friend 's elbow . ; Judge Symington is right . What we have to find out now is whether the men who settled these bottoms have any legal rights at all under this '  --  a brief , scornful smile crossed his thin face this so-called government . ' He straightened his shoulders and faced Major Bradford . I am prepared , sir , ' he said firmly , to defend , in any court in this land , my right to ride to the assistance of my friends . ' Philip stepped forward , and , seizing shrewdly on the one appeal he thought might move John to accept his decision , he laid on his shoulders two obligations . I am counting on you , ' he said slowly , to help Cavin take hold . And , ' he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of jail . ' He stood for a moment watching John with the same close attention that he gave to a man just coming out of a congestive chill . Besides , ' he reminded him , your turn may be later . ' He saw the blood coming back to John 's face , and , with a nod of satisfaction , he turned toward Major Bradford . I am ready , sir , ' he said composedly . The Bishop shot a warning glance under his lids toward Major Bradford . His finger-tips felt cold as he clenched them . If only the Major would remember a little of what he had been telling him this very morning , when the sentry galloped up ! Only a little would he enough . Major Bradford looked straight into the faces of the four men in front of him , and saluted sharply . You are , sirs , I believe , all officers of the Confederate Army ? ' he inquired , looking from , Judge Symington to Povey , and from them to William and Philip . They bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradford , I will ask you to meet me at my quarters at '  --  he seemed to be weighing the hour  --  at nightfall , gentlemen . I trust that will give you time to arrange your affairs ? ' he inquired courteously . By nightfall , ' Philip responded slowly . You may expect us , sir . ' He snapped open his watch and held it against the Major 's . It is now nearly midday . ' Major Bradford signalled to a junior officer in line . Thesep303gentlemen will require no escort and no protection , ' he informedhim , and turned again to the men in front of him . I wish you good day , gentlemen . ' His eyes sought the Bishop 's . Good day , Bishop Gregg , ' he bowed . Accept my appreciation of your generous advice . ' The Bishop 's hands fell open . Somehow the Lord must have put the right words into his mouth this morning . Well , ' said Judge Symington , watching the troops depart , that gives us good time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate carefully and went inside . Harriet , ' the men on the porch heard him calling to his wife , Harriet . ' Philip glanced again at his watch and then sat down by Povey on the steps . Hardly time to make it to Locust Hill and back , I suppose , ' he remarked easily . It was the first time they had spoken together since the night Povey had flung past him in William 's yard , now over six years ago . It seems , ' Philip went on , holding his calm gaze steady , that we are going to be together for some time . We might as well settle on some suitable topics of conversation , do n't you think ? ' Povey 's eyes never varied . At last he spoke , as evenly as Philip . Are you by chance sending a note home ? Perhaps , in that case , you will be good enough to include in it some mention of my heavy debt to you . ' He stopped , but Philip undcrstood he had not finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , makes any topic of conversation possible between us , I should think . ' Except one , ' Philip said , after a long silence . Except one , ' Povey agreed slowly . Except one . '  |p303Two  weeks later , the county had quieted down  --  temporarily , at least . Lavin decided to try to see Philip and , after that , to ride out on the prairie and take a look at his long-horned steers . When he returned at dusk , Lucina and Letitia were rocking by the dining-room fire , and a fresh norther was whipping around the house , sending the dust in fine showers of ' sand against the windows . The twins and FitzHugh , on low stools at Letitia 's feet , were holding out their wide yellow bowls fir ' . Aunt ? Ivy to fill with the grits she was scooping out of a black iron pot steaming on the hearth . Lavin paused at the door , liking the picture he saw . He had been out all day with Jake and his father 's cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their rawbonedhips . He intended to drive the animals down into the shelter of the woods before the cold winter rains began , for he knew that one December day might be balmy , like June , and the next freezing , with a heavy , sleety rain miring the cows in their tracks . The cowhands , too , understood the tricky weather , and every day they pushed farther and farther out onto the open , unfenced range to find Philip 's wandering long-horned steers . When spring came , Lavin decided he would send them out fir a whole month to round up all the Locust Hill cattle that had strayed into other herds . Ile was tired and cold , but exultant , when he reached home.  |p305Already  Lucina had learned to keep a pot of coffee hot by the hearth , and tonight , when he came in , shaking the wet from his clothes as irascibly as old George , on rainy days , shook the damp from his fur , she reached immediately for the cup that stood waiting on the window-ledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange peeling . Pouring a careful measure of brandy over the sugar , she lighted it , watching the mixture turn to caramel . Then , without a word , she filled the cup and handed it to Cavin . He drank it , stretching out his spurred boots to the fire with a luxurious sigh of utter relaxation . Soon he stirred himself and pulled a roll of damp newspapers out of his pocket . As he did so , FitzHugh finished his supper , got up from his chair and climbed up into his brother 's lap , confidently lying back against his chest and sticking out his thin little legs in ridiculous copy of Cavin 's own posture . I met a wagon coming in from Houston , ' Cavin said , settling FitzHugh more comfortably in his lap and peeping around at his face . How are you , old chap ? ' he interrupted himself to ask . The child smiled widely and burrowed deeper . Cavin continued , There 's plenty of news . ' Lucina held out her hand for the Telegraph , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already knew . Wait ! I 'll tell you ! ' He held back the papers watching her face . Would you believe it ? ' he demanded , the ( , u. crnur 's come to his senses ! He 's not only calling on the citizens to form their own guard units , but he 's actually set the ( late for an election . Let 's see ' Opening the paler , he consulted it briefly . January the eighth , ' he said slowly . " That gives us nearly two months to get in our work . ' Leaning back in his chair , he pulled the child closer , and began to shape his plans , whistling softly between his pursed lips . Lucina took the paper from him and scanned it.  | You talk exactly the way Shelby did all summer , Gavin ! I can see right now that Letitia and I might just as well get ready to run this plantation until the election 's over , anyway . We 've just come in from the quarters , ' she informed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 'd you find Uncle Claib ? I was afraid he would n't be alive , today , when I was down to see him last night . ' We took David along , but '  --  Lucina smiled  --  Claib thought he was too young to be much of a doctor . He thinks the old fellow 'll pull through , though . Aunt Mattie 's nursing him . ' She 'll look after him , ' Lavin agreed . I see you are beginning to know your way around here , Lucy . ' His eyes rested on her approvingly . Did you go by to see Philip ? ' Letitia asked him suddenly , laying clown a paper . Cavin 's lace grew suddenly serious . They would n't let Inc see him , ' he declared , in an anxious tone . I left the clot Iles. ( ; c l knows if they 'll give ' em to him . ' He sat looking at Letitia , trying to interpret the events of the day . Major Bradford 's been recalled to Galveston . The higherupsseemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody knows yet what the new man 's like  --  like all the rest of ' em , I reckon , ' he concluded disgustedly , and then went on with his news as Letitia fixed her eyes on him , listening with tense attention . They have n't set the date of the trial yet . ' He turned his gaze moodily toward the fire . Of course , ' he continued , the best thing would be to get Pa 's case transferred to Judge White 's court . That 's what we had all been hoping to do , but look here ! ' He reached over to Lucina 's lap and hunted through the roll of papers till he found the Galveston News.  |p307Here  's the Governor 's latest ruling  --  in big letters on the front page . Listen ! ' Lavin began to read aloud , emphasizing each word , as he spoke it with a stroke of his brown forefinger . " There is no constitutional state government . " ' ( ' We already knew that , ' commented Lavin dryly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial of offenders before military tribunals , but believe it to be a necessity . " ' Well , ' Lavin said , laying down the paper , that 's clear enough . ' He began to whistle softly again , drumming one set of fingers on his chair-arm . Then he glanced toward Letitia . Do n't worry too much , ' he advised her . There 's always some way to beat the old devil around the stump . ' Lucina sat quiet , watching a slow smile appear and spread over Cavin 's serious face . She wondered what could possibly be amusing him , as he suddenly began to laugh aloud . Did Maria tell you ? ' he asked . She and Jake want to get married  --  right away . ' I 've been expecting it , ' Lucina replied . She 's been mooning around for weeks . Well , ' she decided , it 's a good idea . ' I thought so too , ' he agreed . I promised Jake a fine wedding . ' Why , yes , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christmas Eve , along with the fireworks . ' She glanced up smiling . The Bishop is apt to be in the neighborhoodaround that time . ' Lucina tapped a bell on the window-ledge beside her . Maria , ' she said to her maid reproachfully when the girl stood in the doorway , why n't you tell me ? ' Lawd , Miss Lucy , ' Maria giggled , fingering her apron , you knowed it , all de time . ' Just then , Jake came in with an armful of wood for the fire , and , seeing Maria , paused uncertainly at the door.  | Jake , ' said Cavin , how 'd you and Maria like me to build you a new cabin , down by the creek ? ' And , ' asked Letitia , how about a wedding Christmas Eve ? ' Jake cast a broad smile at Maria . Us been thinkin ' dat-a-way ourselves , ai n't we , Maria ? ' She nodded , and looked toward Lucina . Ef n Miss Lucy laks de notion . ' Her soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lucina laughed . Of course , Maria . ' The next week , Cavin was almost never at home , and , as Lucina had predicted , she and Letitia soon had to take over the management of the plantation . As the weeks went on , however , most of the task fell to Lucina ; for , as the winter approached , Letitia felt less and less like moving around . Lavin was often away , looking after the cattle or electioneering for William , and in his absence , Lucina had to help Uncle Matt plan the work and attend not only to giving out supplies from the commissary but also to looking after the sick , the old , and the young children on the place . Now , she thought , she knew what had kept Susanna always so busy . During the late fall , following Letitia 's advice , Lucina set the negro women to making work garments and cotton comfortersand quilts . Matt kept the young men busy digging up stumps , repairing rail fences , clearing new fields , or grading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoe handles , and plaiting mule collars out of corn shucks , or harness out of hides . Lavin had had it in mind ever since he returned home todrain a swamp that covered several acres down by the river . If you ever get a place like that drained , ' he told Lucinareflectively every time they rode by , it 'll grow a plenty cotton . ' About the first of December he began the task , selecting hisp309men carefully for the work , and going with them himself instead of sending Uncle Matt alone . Why are you always down there ? ' Lucina asked him , when he came in late to supper one night . Well , I figured I 'd better be around , ' he told her , and frowned . That swamp is alive with rattlesnakes . I saw one old fellow there as big as my arm yesterday . We counted his rattles after we killed him . ' He looked at her significantly . There were twenty left on his tail , and the Lord knows how many broken off . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh . Do n't you know , ' he asked her , that a snake grows a rattle every year of his life ? ' Leaning over , he kissed her lightly . You 've still got a lot to learn about this bottom ! ' Next day , Lucina insisted on accompanying him down to the swamp . Thought you were afraid of snakes , ' Cavin said to her , as he knelt and held out his hand for her to spring from into her saddle . She was wearing Susanna 's velvet riding habit , and looked , he thought , though he did not say so , as pretty as anybodycould look . I am , ' she answered . I 'm scared to death of them . ' She did not lift her reins , but sat looking anxiously down on him . What do I do , if you get bit ? ' He turned Pilot 's head toward the river , and reaching over from his saddle , rumpled her dark hair . Listen ! I 'm taking you along for company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied . Well , ' he warned her , you wo n't like thinking about it . You tie a string just above the bite , and take your knife and slice deep down to the bone . Then you suck out the poison , drink a lot of whiskey , and send for a doctor  --  and pray , if you 're not too drunk from the whiskey . That 's about all . '  |p310It  's aplenty , ' she shuddered , and poked tentatively at a package on his saddle . That 's your medicine case , I suppose . ' Cavin pulled up his horse some distance from the swamp . Horses are nearly as scared o ' snakes as you are , ' Cavin explained . Better tie ' em here . ' As he spoke , he was unstrappingfrom the back of his saddle a pillow that he had brought along for Lucina to rest on . Watch out ! ' he warned her as they took a narrow trail running between low bushes . The snakes are all stirred up now , though when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her long riding skirt over her arm and followed behind him with wary steps , her eyes on the ground . When they reached the place where a ditch was being dug , she climbed thankfully into a high wagon standing there . Be careful , ' she begged Cavin . He stood with one booted foot on the wagon tongue , and his strong , brown hands clasped lightly around his bent knee . Now , maybe you better wrap me up in cotton , Lucy , I might break , ' he teased her , cocking an innocent blue eye up at her . Here , hold this . ' He handed her his kit . I have to start the hands to work . ' She sat there in the wagon , leaning back against her pillow . It was a warm day , like early summer in Georgia , and there was not a breath of chill in the air . She felt deeply content , and half penitent because she felt so . I ought to be worrying about Uncle Phil . And I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here I am sitting in a wagon in the middle of a swamp full of rattlesnakes , feeling perfectly happy . ' She leaned further back and closed her book , staring up through the branches at the drifting masses of white cloud ; time her . Here on the Gulf coast , where the moisture hung sop311thick in the air , the sky was almost never clear and solidly blue , as she remembered it in the mountains . Her eye fell on the limb above her , where a bunch of mistletoe studded with tiny pearl-like berries hung suspended in the still , bright air . Jake would have to climb up and haul it down for Christmas . She watched a squirrel jumping from one tree to the next , with its fuzzy tail serving for a rudder , and she heard crows cawing lustily in a cornfield across the bayou , and the steady chopchop-chopof the negroes ' shovels dipping into wet black ooze . Then , just as she felt her eyes closing , she sat up with a start , alert and listening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavin calling . Jake ! ' The sharp warning in his voice roused her to sudden attention . She raised herself to look , and saw Jake poised for a tremendousleap , pushing out his free hand to balance himself . But the footing was slick and he fell sideways with his extended hand striking the ground just in front of a thick brown coil that moved , at first , with sickening jelly-like motion and , then , suddenly with darting , angry speed . Jake lay still , as if paralyzed , and the negro working beside him stood drawn back in horror , unable to move . Cavin took two strides , and , as Matt came running up with a heavy stick , aimed his pistol at a snake writhing off into the bushes . Then he hurried to the wagon and reached for his bag , which Lucina handed to him without a word . Leaning far over the wagon 's side she watched to see what he was doing . Where 'd he get you ? ' he asked Jake briefly . The negro lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb , but he was too terrified to speak . Kneeling beside him , Gavin said , , Just a minute , boy . ' Lucina saw the red blood spurt and the flow die down . Then she saw Gavin push Jake 's thumb between his lips and suck vigorously , spewing out his mouth , from time to time , on the black , wet earth . There ! ' she heard Gavin saying , and then saw him reach out his hand to a stump against which he had laid his whiskey bottle . As he did so , there was a sharp rattle and a flash and he sprang up , looking at his own hand . Before he could speak , Matt was pounding the second snake to death , and Lucina was out of the wagon at his side , holding up her long skirts around her . Whar 'd it come from ? ' Matt exclaimed . Lavin peered into the stump and pointed . Hollow , ' he said , briefly . Probably the mate . ' Already he had cut deep to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the blood out . Matt was kneeling by him twisting a cord above his wrist , but Lucina pushed him aside , and applied her own lips to Cavin 's palm . He pulled his hand away , in a sharp and sudden gesture . Let me sec your mouth . ' She opened it wide and he peered inside . All right , ' he said , and gave her back his hand . She sucked till she thought her lungs would burst . There , that 'll be enough , I guess , ' he said finally , and turned to Jake , who was now sitting up weakly , white showing in strange , gray patches through his black skin . Tipping the whiskeybottle , Lavin drank half of its contents himself and handed the rest to Jake . Finish it , ' he told him , shortly . They climbed into the wagon , to which one of the hands was already hitching a pair of mules . Matt ! ' Lavin leaned over the wheel . You know what to do . ' Was-sub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p313I  better stay here . Asa 'll drive you home . I done sont Henry to fetch Doctor David . Go on , Asa ! ' Lavin laid his head on Lucina 's lap , and grinned at Jake , who was shaking as if he were in a malarial chill . Cheer up , Jake . You 'll feel a heap wuss by night , but you 'll be up in plenty o ' time for your wedding . ' They were both out sooner than that , although they both suffered for a long time with aching heads and swollen arms . There was never much use trying to get work out of the hands around Christmas-time , Lavin knew , especially with a wedding in prospect . Therefore , he gave up draining the swamp until after the holidays . Lucina set some of the women to sewing for Maria , and others to baking cakes , using dozens of the eggs Aunt Emmy had been accumulating in a big tin bucket against this time of extra need . She had taken them out of their nests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clean straw . Now , when she wanted them , she triumphantly produced them . Gwine-a make you a big wedding cake , ' she told Maria . She made a three-tiered one that sat like a king amid the lesser cakes arranged in the dining-room cupboard . For weeks , seated beside a long table in the back yard , the negro women had been seeding raisins by hand , washing currants , e undying orange peeling , grating coconuts , and picking out pee tns and walnuts , while their babies lay in a row on the bat k gallery , wrapped in blankets . Every morning Lucina and Letitia would go : mound stooping over each bundle , inspecting the black baby inside each cocoon . Lucina wondered how anybody could be so blind as to imagine that because babies were black , they all looked alike . Very soon she was able to tell at sight which child belonged to which mother.  | The cakes were finally baked and ready  --  the black wedding cake high above all ; and below it , packed solidly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the jelly , and fig , and pound cakes for which Aunt Emmy was famous . Ten days before Christmas the Bishop returned from Austin . The Governor had been firm , he reported . Cases like Philip 's had to be tried in the military courts . But he had promised to bear the circumstances in mind and to review the decision . Right after New Year 's I 'd better start for New Orleans , ' the Bishop concluded his report . It was plain he did not expect much help from Governor Hamilton . Well , ' Cavin said slowly , darting a suggestive glance at the Bishop , there 's another possibility . Better come to the county guard meeting at Holly Grove this evening . We are appointing road patrols and '  --  his eyes twinkled  --  taking up a collec-tion . ' Collection ? ' asked the Bishop , dully . He was very tired after his long ride . Oh , for charity , ' said Cavin lightly . It 's down on the books like that , anyway . The Helping Hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor in Cypress County . ' This time , the Bishop 's mind quickened . Ah ? ' he said , lifting his brows . Exactly , ' responded Cavin , a slow smile appearing in his own eyes . Permit me , ' said the Bishop cheerfully , to remit your usual contribution to my salary , the amount to be applied to the purpose you mention . ' Gavin shook his head . I believe there 's enough on hand . No telling when we 'll need more , though  --  or how often . ' Christmas approached , and the wagons returned from Galvestonloaded with firecrackers and Roman candles and sky/rockets and stockings for the old people and with balls and harps for the children . All day in her big kitchen , Aunt Emmy made batches of white taffy candy and yellow molasses chips , and popped corn , while Letitia filled many red gauze bags to hang on the holly tree just outside the garden gate . She counted them ; there was one for each colored child on the plantation and identical ones for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked hopefully out at the early sky and laid her hand on the fig tree outside her window . Gavin ! It 's nice and warm . ' Her tone was surprised . GeorgiaChristmases were often chilly . It usually is , ' remarked Gavin , pulling on his boots . I can remember only a few times when it was too cold to hang the presents outside . Better set Jake to tying all the bags on early , ' he warned her , and to clipping on the candles and fixing up the cleats to hold the sky-rockets . That 'll keep him from getting nervous , ' he suggested , and drew Lucina down on his knee . A man does , you know , black or white . Did n't you see my legs shaking at Cedar Ledge ? ' Lucina kissed him lightly . Foolish ! ' Then more soberly , Are n't you going to be home today , Gavin ? ' He looked up at her , worried . I know I 'm leaving a lot to you and Letitia . ' Lucina rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practising the wedding march and the Bishop will be putting on his robes . Come on to breakfast . ' Letitia had preceded them to the table , and was pouring their coffee when they sat down . Do n't ask me any questions , ' Gavin said mysteriously , smiling at her and beginning on his toasted cheese , but I 'm thinking about buying you a present while I 'm out . '   Toward evening , Lucina went out on the gallery several times , looking anxiously down the long drive . Soon it would be time to light the candles on the holly tree , and Cavin was not yet back . There was no wind stirring ; it would be a nice night . The sky was filled with the warm , almost golden , light she had learned to expect in Texas at sunset ; but already the shadows which so soon followed the orange glow were falling over the tree-tops , whose branches seemed to merge in a violet mist  --  a color much warmer than the intense blue which at dusk fell over the Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on Cedar Ledge , and that Susanna and Beauford were farther yet  --  so far , indeed , that she might never hope to reach them . Her thoughts saddened her , for she was too young to take comfort in rememberingthose she had lost , thus briefly calling them back to transient life . She wished li ) r Gavin , but he was not in sight . At length , she gave up her vigil and turned inside , to supervise Maria 's dressing . She was pinning down her veil , which she had contrived out of an old mosquito bar , when she heard Cavin 's step on the gallery . Already , she could pick it out of a thousand treads , that quick , confident step of Cavin 's . Then she heard a slower and heavier footfall than his , and Letitia 's piano was suddenly silent . I 'll be back in a minute , ' Lucina cried breathlessly . When she reached the hall , Philip had the twins in his arms , and Cavin was standing back of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly on his hair , turning it to a pale golden yellow . He was smiling , manifestly happy , but Philip looked immensely weary , and his shoulders sagged , although his eyes were bright . ' Did n't I tell you I 'd buy you a present ? ' Lucina heard Cavin reminding Letitia.  |p317Then  Philip noticed Lucina leaning against the shadowy wall . Buy 's the right word , Lucy , ' he said , sending her an affectionateglance . Gavin did a right smart bit o ' buying today . ' How on earth --  ' asked Letitia , her voice returning to her . The Bishop appeared in the parlor door , his robes falling around him in long , draped folds , and his wide sleeves scraping the door jamb . His eyes caught Cavin 's . The charity fund , I suppose ? ' Cavin smiled . Pa was sick , was n't he ? And they seemed to be needing money . ' He slapped his pockets , enjoying the telling . I happened to have it , that 's all . ' Continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting outside for him , and Horace was there to drive Cousin William and Povey home . ' How  --  how are they ? ' asked Letitia , suddenly . Philip glanced at her , and waited a perceptible moment to answer . Well , ' he replied , equivocating , nobody could consider the place we 've been living in a health resort , exactly . Still , ' he remarked comfortably , we may have time to get well bell r  --  the officers in the Freedman 's Bureau decide they want their rake-off , too . They will , of course , Cavin , ' he said , dropping into a chair , and addressing his son . You 're worn out ! ' Letitia exclaimed , noticing his pallor . You ought to be in bed . ' The Bishop opened his large gold watch with the picture of a leaping deer on its case . I 've promised to hold service at the garrison at midnight , and early church at Berryville in the morning . ' Cavin beckoned to Lucina.  |p318Find  Maria , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down at the piano . Philip took the walnut chair , with grapes carved on its high curved back , that was drawn up close to the keyboard , and Lucina and Cavin fell in behind him . The house servants filed in through the hall door and Jake , entering through the long window of the gallery , took his place in front of the Bishop . From time to time he looked nervouslytoward Cavin , but the smile on his black face never varied . Milly , carrying a basket of rose petals , halfway opened the door into the parlor from the hall , peered hesitantly in , and finally , in response to Lucina 's signal , entered , scattering petals as she walked . Behind her walked Maria- , under her white veil . ' Dearly beloved . ' The Bishop 's rich voice filled the parlor . ... Who giveth this woman ? ' he asked . ' I do , ' said Philip , rising stiffly . ' Bless ... preserve , ' the Bishop read . Amen , ' echoed Lucina and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that they were back on the verandah at Cedar Ledge . Then Cavin shook Jake 's hand , and Aunt Emmy bustled forward to congratulate and kiss Maria , while Matt went out to ring the ploughshare summoning the field hands to the house . He was shaking his head as he walked , and grumbling beneath his breath . Lawd ! Lawd ! ' he said to himself . All dat fuss about a weddin ' . An ' none o ' de fo ' wives I'se had in my life wuth killin ' , not ary one of ' em . Lessen it wuz Hallie , now  --  she war n't so bad . ' His mind went back to the lithe brown girl that he had marriedbefore Philip brought Mary to live in Florida . Now she lay , under the hanging moss , as silent as Mary . But Mattp319remembered her , this Christmas Eve ; and he thought of her , not as his present age , but as fleet and light-footed , unchanged by time . Soon the colored children began streaming across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shower of stars against the dark sky . Lucina leaned over the front gate watching Cavin , in his role of Santa Claus . She laughed silently , remembering how she had had to stuff the red suit with pillows , to pad out the thin figure beneath it . Now , Cavin looked jolly and fat standing in front of the tree , as a line of colored children , escorted by their mothers , filed past him , lifting wondering , eager eyes . Lucina knew exactly what would now take place . Every Christmas Eve of her life she had watched Beauford in the part that Cavin was now assuming . She was a big girl , though , she remembered , before she ever once suspected that it was her father behind the white , flowing whiskers . Now , she stood with her eyes on her husband watching him go through the familiar ritual that she knew by heart . Cavin was stooping over a very black little girl , with wrapped pigtails of hair standing up straight and stiff all over her woolly , round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers ? ' he was asking her earnestly . Lucina knew he would put that question to every single child who paused , with wide eyes , in front of him . If the invariableanswer , Yas-suh , Mas ' Santa Claus , ' went unquestioned , then he would drop the expected present into the child 's outstretched palm . But if some mother had a complaint to make , he would sternly withhold his hand . What 's that you say , Mandy ? This child talks back , and wo n't say his prayers ? I am surprised . Well , well . Of course , he ca n't have a present . Santa Claus only visits good children . '  | Cavin would drop that child 's gift back into a pouch at his waist and frown severely on the miscreant . When the gifts were finally distributed , however , Lucina knew that Santa Claus would begin to look around him , as he soon did . She leaned further over the gate , to hear better . Where are all those bad children ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ordered . I 'm goin ' to give ' em one more chance . Liza ! Jimmy ! Fanny ! If I give you these presents , are you gwine-a be good this whole next year ? ' Falling unconsciously , at the end of his inquiry , into the children 's own dialect , he awaited the usual affirmative reply . Then he began handing out firecrackers and Roman candles , and went himself to superintend the setting off of the skyrockets . Soon they sprang , sizzling high above the trees , explodingin a burst of ' final glory that both delighted and terrifiedFitz ! high , who was clinging to Aunt Elvy 's hand , with his small , excited face turned upward toward the stars . As Cavin walked down the lane , he could see fireworks going up from William 's plantation , and from Colonel Brashear 's too . What a fine Christmas ! ' he thought , recalling the one he had passed , the preceding year , in mud and cold . Philip and Letitia were sitting on a garden bench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the long lane shouting and shooting firecrackers , completely unaware that thousands of white boys , who loved their fleeting youth , had marched to their deaths because of them . In their midst , Felicia and Letitia were running about , entirely unconscious of the pallor of their skins . Philip sat with his arm around Letitia's- shoulders , remembering , in the darkness , the children who had died in Florida , and how Cavin had looked the first Christmas he had stretched out his tiny hands to the Christmas tree Mary had set up byp321his cradle . All this was a past in which Letitia had had no part , and yet he felt it was true that she had somehow shared in it . Again he wondered , as he so often had , what is past and what is present in what men call life , never once knowing what the word means . The candles slowly burning out there on the holly tree might have been those that Mary had lighted her first Christmas Eve as his bride . Nearly forty years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled him . Cavin slipped into the house , and left his Santa Claus suit where Philip always kept it  --  in the locked cedar chest . Then he came out and joined Lucina , handing her a long Roman candle to match the one he held in his hand . For an hour , then , they lighted firecrackers and shot off Roman candles , pausing now and then to watch the bright balls of fire going up from the quarters where Jake and Maria were celebrating their wedding . They did not notice when Letitia and Philip left their seats in the garden and went inside . But finally they tired themselves ; and , when at last the women began taking their sleepy children home , they dropped down on the long gallery step , breathless and laughing . It was a warm night and the stars seemed low enough to touch as they moved , mysterious and brilliant , across the sky . The musicians were fiddling in the quarters and the so n d of dancing feet drifted across the silent fields . Christmas Gift ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cavin . I 've caught you ! ' she exulted . Christmas Gift ! ' Cavin returned , only half awake . ' I must-a been asleep , ' he yawned , to let you catch me . ' I  --  I have a present for you , ' she said softly . What ? ' he answered , scarcely interested . I t had been a long day . He wanted to get up and go in , but he felt too lethargic to move . To think it had been as easy as that to buy Philip'sp322freedom ! The scoundrels ! ' he thought . The rascally scoun-drels ! ' What have you got for me ? ' he asked her again , with his mind less on his question than on her face , which lay on his knee , quiet against his hand . Your son , ' she told him , in a voice so low that he had to bend low to hear what she said. pCHRISTMAS DAY , Philip kept to his bed . He was not sick , he told Letitia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eggnog she brought to his bed . I ' 11 get up tomorrow , ' he promised her . But the next morning , and the next , he felt no inclination to rise . Still , no one was especially alarmed , least of all Philip himself . It seemed to him , as it did to everyone else , that his experiences had been such as to induce fatigue and prostration in a man of his age . He did not even suspect what was the matter with him until he began to study the rise and fall of the fever that soon began to turn his head giddy . Then he sent for Gavin . Find out whether Judge Symington and William and Povey are down . ' The Judge and Povey were , but they had not thought much about the matter . Slow fever , ' they had guessed , perhaps , and , if so , a person had to wear it out . David had been to sec Povey , but the Judge had not sent for him . He was wailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Gavin in a weak , querulous voice . What does a young whipper-snapper like David know ? ' he inquired irritably , shaking his buzzing head . As soon as Philip heard how both his prison companions were affected , he knew what ailed them and him . He had thought vaguely of the possibility of typhoid while he was in the garrison . Now he was certain what fever burned in him , hotter every day . At first he consulted with David about his treatment , but soon he was delirious , floating away , like a feather on a current of air . January the eighth was the day set for the elections . It was pouring rain and dismally cold . Lavin was reluctant to leave his father , but Philip seemed no worse , so he and the McGaughey brothers rode off together to round up William 's supporters . The weather was bad and the roads so treacherous that many Unionists , feeling certain of victory , simply stayed home . And , as John McGaughey had promised , the German vote went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the loyalistshad never expected . Furthermore , for weeks Judge White had been riding up and down the county urging the planters and their sons to take all the required oaths and appear at the polls , even if they were turned down . The registrars were strangers to the county , and there were no birth records to search . How were they to be sure of either the age , the possessions , or the actual sentiments of a returned soldier ? The upshot was that William outran his opponent by a large majority . But neither he nor Lavin had it in them to rejoice , for it was now clear that Philip was a dying man . David visited his bedside , Judge Symington 's , and Povey 's in turn . Of the three he thought only Povey would recover . Philip and the Judge were almost beyond the reach of the Freedman 's Bureau . Looking at his father 's sharp , worn face , Lavin reflected , however , that the military had caused his death quite as effectively as if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessionof him , dulling his grief . Philip slept most of the time and was seldom conscious , andP325then only for a few moments at a time . Day in and day out , Letitia sat on one side of his bed , Cavin on the other , and the management of the place devolved more and more upon Lucina and Matt . As the rains kept up and a dizzy wretchedness began to overwhelm her , it seemed to Lucina a long time  --  a century  --  since the Christmas Eve when Philip had first returned home , and they had all been happy . Cavin and Letitia , she saw , were too much occupied with Philip to realize what she was suffering . She had had no idea that bearing a child involved so much physical misery . Only Aunt Emmy had time to gather her in her wide and comfbrtable lap and assure her that soon she would be feeling better . How soon ? ' asked Lucina feverishly . A day more seemed toa long for her to endure what she was enduring . Each morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She realizedthis was no time to add to Letitia 's and Cavin 's troubles , but if he remembered that Lucina was going to bear his child , . he gave no sign of it . For all she could tell , he had no thought of anything except the election and the progress of Philip 's illness . She believed that he had not even noticed her yellow pallor and her dizzy , shuddering exhaustion . And , indeed , Cavin did not suspect that Lucina was really suffering . He supposed  --  and Letitia 's uniformly good health supported this belief  --  that what Lucina was passing through was a normal experience and nothing to be alarmed about . lie did notice that she had little to say , but he put her taciturnity to the long strain of Philip 's illness , which had driven every other thought out of his own mind . For between Philip and Cavin there existed a stronger bond than unites most fathers and sons . Their thoughts fitted togetherlike hand and glove , the mental processes of the one vivifying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , they had enjoyed one another , less as parent and child than as two companionable men interested in working out a set of common problems . As Cavin watched Philip wasting away , the sharpest pain he had ever yet felt closed around his heart and gripped it . Philip had been sick almost a month when he awoke one night , feeling light and free , cured of suffering . He was entirely conscious , but he was aware that some strong force was drawing him out into a void ; whatever it was on which he floated , he knew it felt like the undertow that at certain points on the Galveston beach could carry the strongest swimmer out into the Gulf . Once caught in that steady flow , resistance was useless . Now Philip , as he lay on his bed , felt that a current of similar strength was pulling him away . Where ? He had not even strength to wonder . But the 01 ( 1 habit of inquiry was aroused in him . Is this death ? he thought quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , who had watched so many others die ? How strange , he thought , that even a physician never knows what death feels like  --  to the one who is dying . That 's it , ' he thought . I 'm seeing it now from the inside . ' He felt keenly interested irr what was happening to him , not frightened , not even rebellious , only very curious . He opened his eyes with much difficulty and , having opened them , it seemed they would not close . No matter . Perhaps he could manage to open his lips too . He saw Cavin leaning over him . He had not been there , Philip thought , a moment before . His mind worked clearly and precisely . Always he had wanted to feel sure how long the ( lying were conscious of sensation , how long their muscles obeyed their will . Words came easily to his lips . To his own ears , his voice sounded high and shrill , piercingly high . He did not know thatP327Cavin caught only the faintest whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that fluttered faintly out of them . I 'll move my finger as long as I can , ' Philip said . By the most tremendous effort of will , he forced his forefinger to begin its slow swing , and he strained every faculty he possessedto keep it going . The fate of the universe seemed to him to hinge on whether he could move it ever so slightly . He watched its motion slow down , pause , then start again , and at last cease entirely . As it stopped , Cavin saw plainly the surprisethat flared in his father 's eyes , and then , almost instantly , like the snuffing of a candle , they were blank . Lavin sat there a long time , feeling wearier than he had supposed a person could feel , conscious as yet of no other sensation . Should he wake Letitia ? No , she would know soon enough . He walked over to where Matt was asleep on a pallet , aroused him , and told him to send Jake for David and to bring hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dressed him , and closed his eyes , and stretched his thin limbs straight and crossed his gracefulhands upon his breast . Then they made up his bed and laid on it the long firm board that every planter kept in his str rrcr ) inn to remind him that life is a perilous adventure . When Philip 's emaciated body was at last covered with a sheet awl a bedspreadand lay decently , as he had always said a man 's body should , in his own bed , under his own roof , Matt could no longer hold back his grief . Mas ' Lavin , ' he said brokenly , when they had finished , yo ' pa an ' me ai n't never been separated befo ' . ' Gavin felt a deep pity for Matt . For himself ' he felt nothing at all , not all night as he sat beside the bed , not even when the morning broke and he saw that Philip 's face was ashen and gray , the very color of the faces both he and Cavin had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , at sunrise when David had come , and left her there beside Philip , while he stumbled in to Lucina . Not until he felt her warm body breathing beside him , did he really grasp the fact that Philip , who lay so cold and still down the hall , was really dead . You have a son , ' he promised Philip , in his heart , a son who will not forget what you planned to do . ' And after a moment , he added , his heart leaping , A grandson , too . ' For the first time , the night his own father died , Cavin understood what it felt like for a man to have a child . He could not sleep ; soon he gave up the attempt and dressed himself and went to Philip 's tall desk which had a writing drawer in the middle . There he found what he was looking for  --  a long sheet of white paper . Letitia , hearing him moving about , entered the room and saw what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned with a black ribbon which Cavin inserted through the top of the blank page . Under it he wrote the notice of Philip 's death and the place and hour of his funeral . Today he would send Matt , with a crape band on his coat-sleeve , to all the near-by plantations with the notice ; and tomorrow Philip 's friends would come to bury him , with his head to the West . Under the great magnolia , in the enclosureby the river , Cavin supposed , where Caroline already lay , the first Darcy buried in Texas . Philip would be the second . Who would be the third ? Cavin asked himself . Yesterday the question would never have occurred to him . Jake and Matt dug Philip 's grave , and the day after his death they helped lay him in it . It had rained for days before the funeral , and the ground was sodden , the foliage dripping . But as the little procession started through the back yard , downp329to the plot by the river , the sun broke through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumination which sometimesfalls upon the earth after water has washed it clean  --  an illumination that seems to shine from within every plant and bush , as if they were radiating light already absorbed . But the clouds soon closed over the sun again , and rain was falling in fast , heavy drops before William had finished reading the service . The Bishop was gone on one of his long trips , but Cavin knew that , as fond as Philip had been of him , yet he would still have preferred to have one of his own blood sayingthe last prayers over his body . It was fortunate , Gavin said to himself , as William 's voice rose and fell , that his cousin had kept well , and that he had not yet left for Austin , where the Constitutional Convention was to convene early in February . Before they got back to the house Lucina was drenched and shivering with cold and with a vague , impalpable terror that left her helpless before it . Not fear of death so much as a horror of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she thought . Ours too . ' Cavin was busy with Philip 's friends . Letitia had gone straight to her room , as Lucina wanted desperately to do . It had been days since she had swallowed more than a few mouthfuls of food , and she felt sick , dizzy , and cold . But she did not like to desert Cavin , even though he ( lid not seem to notice her ; and she therefore stayed up until the last carriage had drawn away in the rain , and wet ( lark settled over the trees and rosebushes outside . Then , as she at last prepared for bed , she began to shake in an ague that seemed to spread to her heart and stop it . It was not possible , she thought , for anyone to be as cold as she and yet remain alive . Maria packed hot bricks around her and hot salt bags and sent for Gavin , who poured half his whiskey flask into a glass and held it to her blue , chattering lips . And when finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon she was burning up with a fever that mounted and never ceased to mount . And every breath she drew was biting agony . David , who was lingering on after the others had left , remained all night ; but he knew there was little he could do . That variety of pleurisy was certain to develop into a pneumoniathat would have to burn itself out , like a fire . Only too often , as already he had learned , the battle was over before it had well begun . All her life Lucina was to remember the next week when she begged incessantly for water and always begged in vain . For David had been taught that water was not to be given to pneumonia patients . Therefore he doled out to her at stated intervals thimblefuls of water , no more , no less . After she was well , she could never get enough water , and always kept a glassful beside her bed at night . I t took her a long time to recover , for after her fever left her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after day in her bed . When at last she became fully conscious and knew that she might live , she wondered whether , considering the way she felt , life was worth the effort . She lay for days stretched out almost as still as Philip in his grave . Her watchers could see her dark lashes occasionally moving and her slow breath rising and falling , lifting the sheet , but otherwise , with her pallid , clouded skin and her thin , sunken cheeks , she seemed scarcely alive herself . Aunt Emmy made her wine jelly , and custards , and chicken soup , and every delicacy she could think of ; but all Lucina would swallow was a few sips of hot cornmeal gruel . Once it crossed her mind that that was all she had been able to take on her seasick voyage from Savannah , and she smiled a little . Butp331usually she scarcely thought at all , conscious only of an unendurablesickness and prostration which seemed to have no end . David tormented himself trying to remember what his professors at Charlottesville had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . Apparently men physicians expected women to bring children into the world without fuss , or else to die , also without fuss . He read all of Philip 's books , and all his own too , time and again , but he found no least suggestion in them to tell him what to do . Lavin turned the place over to Matt and Jake to run , and sat all day and most of the night by the fire in Lucina 's room , helping Maria lift and nurse her mistress . It seemed to him that it must have been in another world that Lucina had sat , gay , and well , and happy , on a branching limb in Georgia , the first morning they were engaged , and had promised to go anywhere on earth with him . Well , this was what it had all come to , he thought wretchedly . He wished only for Lucina 's quick recovery , and scarcely remembered the son she had offered him for his Christmas gift . He had no heart for following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was glad to remember that William was at Austin . Sometimes he would open a Galveston News for a fi w moments and read briefly and hurriedly about the Convention , where they seemed to be haggling endlessly as to whether the people did wrong knowingly and willingly ' in attempting secession . Cavin 's every instinct rose up in hot answer to that question . Yet that was the admission the Radicals were trying to obtain up at Austin . They 'll never get it , ' Gavin said to himself with bitter emphasis , and wondered why sensible men could not see that the thing to do was to leave the past alone , and go on from where they were . What did he care , though , what they did up at Austin ?   Lucina was still lying white and sick on her bed , wasting away under his eyes . During the month of February , Cavin wandereddesolately around the house , never still , never satisfied . He was worried about Letitia , too , increasingly worried as March wore on . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the impassive quiet which had so long marked her attitude . She was fond of Lucina , Cavin knew , but she often sat for hours by her bed , saying nothing , hardly stirring , her face like a wax cast . She seemed to be thinking , to be in a long , deep study , to be waiting , listening . Waiting , Cavin supposed , for the birth of her child , in less than a month now , he gathered . Well , if Lucina was going to look like that when she got better  --  if she got better  --  he did not sec that the end was going to be much different from the beginning . 1 le decided , as he watched Letitia and Lucina , that the pleasures of parenthood were greatly overrated . Ile could not tell how Letitia felt about Philip 's death . Indeed , Letitia would have found it hard to put her own emotions into words . During the years they had been married , there had grown up between her and Philip a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt helpless , stripped , and forlorn ; but sometimes at night , thinking of him , she grieved that she was not more desolate . The very warmth of Philip 's affection for her seemed to demand a deeper grief than she actually felt for him . She missed him , as she would have missed any companion on whom she had learned to rely , but she knew that the sorrow she experienced when she thought of him was nothing at all like the anguish that had racked her the first year of her marriage , before she had painfully taught herself to deaden her feelings . Now , she did not permit herself to look beyond the few weeks remaining before her child 's birth . As March wore on , Lucina grew slowly , almost imper-P333ceptibly , better . One clear , sunny morning in the middle of the month , Cavin picked her up and carried her out into the garden , slowly walking with her in his arms between the rosebushesand the beds where the bulbs had already ceased blooming , a month before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked him weakly . It was the first interest she had displayed in anything since the night she had come down with pneumonia . Slowly , and with many backsets , from that day on her strength began to return to her . But when Letitia 's second set of twins was born , on a night in late March , she was still unable to sit up . She had short stretches of bliss now , though , when , if she lay perfectly quiet without moving so much as a finger , her wretched misery would leave her . One night , when she was enjoying a rare period of ease , she heard the servants moving about and David talking , in hushed tones , in the hall to Cavin . But she was afraid to lift her eyelashes or to raise her voice , lest she fall back into the agony out of which she had just climbed for a brief respite . With desperate purpose she prayed for sleep , for forgetfulness , before the room should again begin to sway and turn around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep insensibility that now overtook her whenever she closed her eyes . She was , accordingly , unprepared to have Cavin come into her room early the next morning , as she was regretfully owning her eyes , with two bundles in his arms . He looked pleased and less strained than he had at any time since Philip 's death . Putting the bundles down carefully , one on each side of her , he stood back , smiling at her surprise . Philip and Philippa , two hours old and ready to fight the world , ' he announced , playfully engaging the four tightly closed tiny fists that waved in the air .   From that time on , Letitia 's twins spent more time on Lucina 's bed than in their own . Watching them , as she grew better , she began to wonder what her own child would look like , and to think of it with the delight she had felt at first instead of with the apprehension that her long illness had induced in her . Soon she was sitting up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little later , she began to walk around slowly in the garden . By the time William arrived home from Austin , about the middle of April , and came over to see the twins , she felt almost well again , though no longer agile and lightfooted . The afternoon that William and Helen drove over from Holly Grove , Letitia was u1 ) and around for the first time and Lucina was sitting , pale but comfortable , on the front gallery . Seeing them there , as he turned into the gate with his cousins , Gavin thought gratefully that it looked like his world was beginning to fall again into some kind of order . William admired the twins and congratulated Letitia on their looks and health . But it was plain , despite his affability , that the months of wrangling at Austin had worn on him , for he seemed tired and weary . Yes , he told them briefly , the Convention had done the work expected of it . It had passed the ordinances nullifying secession , slavery , and the state debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a general election to be held in June . The candidate that he and Gavin would naturally supportin this election , he said , was J. W. Throckmorton  --  a man who had been president of the Convention just ended , and who , although he had voted against secession , had served loyally in the Confederate Government as commissioner to the Indians . Looks like it might be possible for us to elect him , ' CavinP335remarked , after considering the political alignment behind the conservative ticket . Well , we can try , ' replied William more doubtfully , but it 'll be a fight , I think , Cavin . ' Lucina listened with a sinking of her heart . She realized that Lavin would soon be immersed in another long political campaign , and she dreaded it . But in William 's election he had learned the wires to pull , and they had only to be pulled over again , this time for John McGaughey , who , after William 's refusal to run again , had permitted his name to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its doubtful close . To the surprise of even the most optimistic Conservatives , the Throckmorton ticket was elected in June by a majority of four to one , and John McGaughey prepared to go up to Austin in August . When Lucina heard the news , her first thought was that at last they would all be free to turn their attention to their own personal affairs . She was tired  --  tired to death  --  of war and elections , she thought vehemently . Lavin , however , began , now that the election was past , to wonder whether it would not be wiser openly to recognize the changed state of affairs by entering into a contract with his hands . He was encouraged in this conviction by reading iii the Galveston News of June the nineteenth a letter from the Freedman'sBureau warning Texas negroes , on the anniversary of their freedom , to stand by their contracts and to work early and late . ' One night , he went over to consult William . Might it not be a good idea , he suggested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of contracts with their negroes ? Certainly , they must all act together . After some talk , they mounted their horses and rode over to sound out I'ovey , whom they found stretched out on his old couch , with Horace lolling beside him . P336This was no time , Gavin had decided , with the directness that usually characterized him , to dwell on personal differences . Besides , as much as he loved his father , he had often thought , since his own marriage , that it was a pity for a pretty young girl like Letitia to have married a man of Philip 's age . He had pushed the matter out of his mind , however , as he did now , in his conversation with Povey . The Freedman 's Bureau , ' Povey agreed dryly , seems at last to be grasping the idea that colored people are not all born with wings '  --  a remark which caused Horace suddenly to clutch his sides and rock . Povey was smiling , himself . Do you recall , William , General Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this county ? ' he asked . William recalled very well how the head of the Bureau had enthusiastically informed the President that the colored people in Cypress County were . fully equal , if not superior , to the whites in industry , moral worth , and ambition . William chuckled at the recollection . Well ! ' he remarked charitably , they seem to be learning . ' The three men talked until late , and , during the next week , invited the McGaughey brothers and David and other planters into conference . Most of them agreed that the time had come to make the best of what would have to be a perilous time of readjustment , and Gavin was instructed to carry down to Galveston a sheaf of contracts to register at the Bureau . He prepared to start one morning toward the end of June . Since he was not taking a loaded wagon-train along this time , lie expected to shorten the trip by riding on the new Galveston , Houston , and Henderson Railroad that now extended from the Gulf to Buffalo Bayou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HeP337was riding , not Pilot as he usually did since Philip 's death , but a new and skittish bay horse named Star , because of the white marking just above his eyes . It was about eleven o'clock when they galloped off , their horses keeping step in swinging , easy stride across the woods to the prairie . They intended to arrive before dark at Lost Island Ranch , where the McGaughey brothers lived together with their families in a huge rambling house built around an open square in the centre , and flanked by wide porches on three sides . It was a big house , and needed to be , for it was always full of visitors . There was a man there now , Cavin remembered , who had come out from North Carolina long before the war to do a little shooting ; and , now that the war was over , had returned , still a welcome guest . The sun was hot and the sky was cloudless , but Jake and Cavin were used to heat , and Cavin 's skin was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tan which , before fall , would turn to brown . The grass hung limply to the earth and would not revive until the cool gulf breeze of evening sprang up , as it usually did , at sunset . Like a sponge , the ground absorbed and muted the sound of the horses ' galloping feet . Cavin and Jake wrapped their handkerchiefs around their necks , feeling , if anything , exhilarated and stimulated by the intense light and heat that enveloped them . Visitors , Gavin knew , always grew depressed and wilted by the sunnier sun , but Texans liked to feel it tingling along their backbones , exciting them , when they were actually out in it . Afterward , of course , he admitted , a chair felt good , or a rest under the trees , with a long , cool drink , but the sun itself was nothing to dread . During his war experience , he had heard Northerners talking so about blizzards and ice and snow . As fi , r him , he would take the sun , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neverP338endure a frozen world five or six months every year , the way Northern people had to . The stillness that surrounded them was intense , a deep , brooding silence that hot afternoons always induce on the prairie . They drew up to rest about three o'clock under the first shade they had passed since they left the bottom that morning . Beside them , a little stream seeped slowly in its shallow bed through the marshy grass , barely moving across the flat , level plain . Lavin and Jake tied their horses , and flung themselves down on the grass , their hands under their heads for pillows , and their knees upraised . Unconsciously they assumed the position which permitted the most air to flow under and around them  --  the air that , at this time in the afternoon , was as still as the prairie around them . Cavin listened intently , but he heard only the thin slithering of grasshoppers ' legs against the leaves , or against the shallow , glassy water , and that sound was so low and so brief as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , vaguely conscious , without putting the thought into words , that the rhythm beating up through the earth flowed in his own veins also . If he had been an introspective person by nature , he would long ago have understood that he had fought , and marched , and hungered not to preserve slavery , not even to preserve state 's rights , but simply in order that a man might continue to work the earth as it pleased him , leading his life according to his own taste , not some stranger 's . He could not imagine living where he could no longer throw himself upon the ground when he pleased and feel the whirling earth beneath him , and himself moving with it . He could not even picture a life where some other man ordered his comings and goings , his sitting down and his rising up.  |p339They  lay there a long time , until the shadows began to slant on the grass outside their resting place . Then , just as the light on the prairie turned from the blazing brilliance of mid-afternoonto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on their way , loping easily in the pace that Texas horses were trained to keep for hours on end . Toward sunset , Cavin saw to the right of him a herd of cattle , and he signalled to Jake to follow him as he altered his course to pass directly by them . If these cattle bore the McGaughey brand , he thought , he and Jake could slow up , for supper and a bed would then be in sight . Lavin knew the direction he was taking well enough ; but in a country without landmarks miles are hard to check off , and cattle will serve as well as trees or creeks to indicate position . He spurred his horse , failing to notice that between him and the cattle there lay , covered over with new grass , a deep furrow that had been plowed up in the fall to guard against prairie fire . Star 's front feet slipped into the ditch , and he made a crouching backward movement , digging his hind feet franticallyinto the slick grass . Lavin , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost automatically in the oppsite direction , but before he could pull his left leg over the saddlehorn , Star had fallen and lay , with his heavy body full upon Cavin 's hip , and his own front legs snapped at the knees . Hurriedly reining in his own horse , Jake jumped oil ' and ran over to his master . There was no chance of Star 's ever rising again ; Jake saw that at once . What was the quickest way to quiet him and get Cavin out from under his desperate plunging ? There was only one answer , and both Jake and Lavin knew what it was . One arm was free , and Lavin pointed to his saddle where his pistol hung , fortunately , on the horse 's exposed flank . Jake hadP340a steady hand , and in a moment , after a few violent jerks , Star lay still . But strain as he did with all his might , Jake could not budge the heavy body and Cavin was caught beneath it . Soon both saw they would have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on the battle field . He had just strength to point , again ; and , as his eyes closed , he caught a blurred glimpse of Jake frantically spurring his horse toward the ranch , which lay , he could only hope , closer than he thought . When he woke , it was to pain , darkness , and thirst such as he had never known , for at Chickamauga his canteen had been full . He lay there an endless time , it seemed to him , alternately conscious and unconscious , forcing his mind , whenever he could , to the surface , so that he might call out if he heard horses approaching . How else would they find him , a small dot , in the dark night , on the bald prairie ? At last , faintly transmitted along the earth 's sounding board , he heard the running tread of horses , and some time later , a low rumble which he interpreted as the turning of wagon wheels . When the sounds grew close , he began to whoop as loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt his mind again becoming blank , and knew he had no more strength left in him to call out even once again , he heard Kirby McGaughey 's voice coming , it seemed to him , from a distance as far as the stars . As he left home , Kirby had snatched up a canvas cot that was standing on his back gallery and had shoved it in the wagon , telling one of the cowhands to jump up in the driver 's seat . Now as he and Jake sat on the grass beside Cavin , waiting for the wagon to come up , he was glad of his forethought . When at last it reached the spot , he slid the canvas as gently as possible under Gavin , uncertain whether he was still breathing . Should he take him on to his own ranch , only an hour 's ridep341ahead , he wondered , or start back with him to Locust Hill and David , who was the nearest doctor ? It took him only a moment to make up his mind . He gave Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurry back with David , and he took his seat in the wagon beside Cavin , pouring whiskey down his throat , at intervals , and washing his face with the water he had ' brought from the ranch in a jug . There was nothing else he could do . Somehow the night passed ; and the wagon moved slowly across the dark prairie , and still Cavin breathed . It was late morning before Kirby caught sight of two rapidly moving specks on the horizon which he had been so anxiously watching . David had just come in from a call when Jake woke him . Within a few minutes he had grabbed a cup of coffee and his saddlebags , and had supplied Jake with another mount . As he galloped off across the prairie , it suddenly occurred to him that , since Philip 's death , he had had no chance to wonder whether he was going to practise in the county or hang up his shingle in Harrisburg . He was never again to think of the matter as unsettled  --  never in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine Cavin . Bending his brown head over him , he said only , Better get him home , ' and handed his horse 's reins to Jake , taking a seat on the wagon bed . It was long past dark , so slowly did they move , before they turned into Philip 's lane . Old George rose growling on the front gallery as he heard the wagon approaching , and Byrnes Armstrong , whom David had sent over to Locust Hill , came out to meet his brother , swinging a lantern . I 'm taking him to the office , ' David told him hurriedly . ' Send me out all the lamps you can find . ' He was grateful now for the experience he had had in hospital tents , and , with his mind on Cavin , did not at once notice that Lucina had come out from the house and was following along beside the cot , with her eyes on Cavin 's face , not on the dark path in front of her . Nor did she notice that the men carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plank that had been laid sideways between the gateposts which separated the front from the back yard . Had she stopped to think , she would have recalled telling Jake to lay the plank there , to keep out the brood of baby chickens that followed behind her every time she opened the gate . Now she completely forgot the barrier and stumbled against it in the dark , falling her full length across it . She cried out in pain , and David , turning instantly , cursed himself for his stupidity . Why had he not watched out for her ? There was only  --  lie counted back swiftly  --  a few more weeks before the end of her painful period of waiting . Motioning to Byrnes to go on , he helped her up , questioning her carefully . No , it was nothing , she said ; she was sorry to be so careless . Doubtfully , he relinquished her to Letitia , who had lingered behind to quiet FitzHugh but had come hurrying out when she heard Lucina 's sharp outcry . Then for the next hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , intently concentrated on the task before him , told them to go . Always , when he had a job like this to do , he was oblivious to anything that happened around him . Always he was conscious of that slow heightening of power within him , that sharp focussing of energies that any artist experiences whenever he throws himself into his work . Ile did not permit his thoughts to wander to Lucina until he had done all he could for Cavin , and had got him onto Philip 's bed . P343Then David stepped out of the long window that led from Philip 's bedroom onto the porch and sank into a chair , resting his head for a moment against its high back . Almost as soon , however , as he had relaxed his muscles he saw Letitia standing in the doorway , looking anxiously out into the dark . Lucina ? ' he asked , instantly on his feet . She nodded . I was afraid ' he began , and saw by Letitia 's face that he had good reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the house , and never once took his clothes off , as he moved back and forth between Lucina 's and Cavin 's rooms . He warned Byrnes to tell anybodysuffering only from malaria that he could not leave Locust Hill . Tell ' em to take a black pill and go to bed , ' he said . ' I ' 11 get around when I can . ' Toward dark , the next day , Lucina 's tiny son was born ; David had no hope that the child would live , and not much more that Lucina would revive from the exhaustion and shock through which she had passed . He told Maria to wrap the child in cotton wool and lay him in a deep basket between warm bricks , but that he did not think it likely they could save him . Leaving Letitia to watch Cavin , and , warning Maria to call him if Lucina stirred , he managed to sleep an hour . Then he hurried back to Lucina 's room , only to see Aunt Elvy dipping a clean rag into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the baby 's small open mouth . Ah ! ' he thought , the child 's still alive , then ! ' Surprised and pleased , he stepped to Aunt Elvy 's side . What you giving him ? ' he asked her quickly . Sugar an ' warm water an ' a drap or two o ' whiskey , ' Aunt Elvy answered , without looking up . ' Did n't seem lak it could hurt him none , ' she explained , testing the cooling bricks with her finger and exchanging them for two warmer ones from the hearth in which she had started a small fire . Good enough ! ' David responded . You know what to do . ' Aunt Elvy sniffed . Knowed whut to do fo ' you wuz bawn , ' she told him , in injured pride , her sunken , old eyes snapping . David smiled for the first time in several days . He had a ruddy face , with an abundance of straight brown hair and keen eyes , oddly matched , for one was almost brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place , however , in his face , but instead gave him a curious appearance of perpetual watchfulness . Now , his glance brightened . Not more'n a few drops at a time , Aunt Elvy , ' he warned the old woman , leaning over the child to listen to his faint breathing . Know dat , too , ' said the old woman crossly . Me an ' Maria 'll watch ' im , ' she promised . " Turning her wrinkled face to David , she explained her nursing plans . Hatter git ole Aunt Mattie up f um de place to take keer o ' my well babies , and Rachel to help Maria nuss Miss Lucy . Jake an ' Matt ai n't gwine-a leab Mas ' Lavin , dat 's sho . I gwine-a take keer o ' dis chile , myself . ' She paused and looked David over , studying him critically and at length . Don ' seem mo'n yistiddy when I was watching yo ' nuss make sugar teats fur you , ' she observed . Then she added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us whut to do , suh , us kin do it . ' David learned , as the days passed , that the old woman had made no idle promise . He found that he could rely on her and on the other nurses to carry out his instructions exactly , with anxious care . And , whenever the weights were changed on Cavin 's leg , Uncle Matt would fall on his knees and pray while his master groaned aloud.  |p345The  days passed , and still all David 's patients lived . He slept now , and ate , at Locust Hill , leaving only when he had to . But it was a full month before he dared tell Cavin that his son had been born , and almost that long before enough life flowed in Lucina for her to care whether either she or her child continued to draw breath in this world . One hot , still morning , late in July , David was feeling Lucina 's pulse when she opened her dark eyes and smiled weakly up at him . You 're getting better every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . After a moment she spoke again , barely opening her lips . Her eyes were insistent , but , although he stooped and listened , he could not make out a word of what she said . He sent a puzzled glance across to Aunt Elvy . Humph ! ' said she , and lifting Lucina 's child proudly out of his basket , laid him on his mother 's arm . Whut else would she a-wanted ? ' Aunt Elvy snapped , later , talking to Maria . Mens  --  even of dey is doctors  --  is mightily lackin ' in plain , awdinery gumption . ' P346ALL August and September Cavin and Lucina slowly improved . And the child , whom they had decided to name Beauford Gavin , since Philip 's own son already bore his father 's name , was keeping a firm hold on life . Miss Lucy , ' Maria told her mistress one morning , two months ago , you could-a put dis-heah boy in a pint cup an ' run yo ' weddin ' ring up his little arm . ' Proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at ' im ! He 's gwine to be as big a man as his pa , ai n't you , sugar-pie ? ' she predicted , addressing the baby , who gazed up out the cocoon of wrappings that enclosedhim as placidly as if he had never had to struggle for life . Lucina looked clown at tier son . She was even yet too weak to feel certain that she could lift him . Give him to me , Maria , ' she said , holding her arms open . Maria knelt and laid her own strong brown hands firmly under Lucina 's white ones . Dar now , ' she said ; look at ' im as long as you please , Miss Lucy . ' Lucina saw that the baby 's hair was as black as her own , and as thick , but the eyes that stared up at her were Cavin 's . She touched his hand  --  it seemed to her unbelievably tiny  --  and noticed , with equal surprise , that , though his hair had come down from her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's long with thin , flattened ends . P347He do n't hardly ever cry , ' Maria said , extolling the virtues of her charge . Lucina held her son to her , startled by the torrent of tendernessthat poured through her . It seemed to her that a part of herself  --  some inner essence of her being too fragile and exquisiteto face this world  --  had , nevertheless , entered into it . This child was not something different from herself , he was her thought externalized , her breath , her heartbeat . Suddenly she knew  --  and the knowledge racked her  --  that every sorrow he felt would be hers twice over , every pain , every loss . Oh Maria ! ' cried Lucina , hugging the child to her , take care of him ! ' I feels dat way ' bout him myself , ' Maria answered gently . And ' bout my own baby , too , ' she added , after a minute 's silence . Maria ! ' exclaimed Lucina . I 've been sick so long , I never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her head back and laughed . I figger I been practising up on dis-heah lamb , ' she declared , peeping over Lucina 's arms . Beauford 's a mighty big name for such a little fellow . I'se gwine-a call ' im Beau . ' And soon that was what they all began to call him . Cavin was able , now in September , to hobble around , but not without pain . During his long illness , he had grown so resentful of the weight hanging from his aching limb , that , despite David 's remonstrances , he had discarded it . I 'd rather be lame than fool with that damn cannon ball on my foot any longer , ' he said , twisting irritably in his bed . Take it off , Jake . ' And it had remained off . Now he walked with a limp that was never remedied until Uncle Matt built up a thick inner sole inside his master 's boot . During July , while he lay ill in one room and Lucina in an- other , William had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered at Galveston . But Letitia , who was running the place , with Uncle Matt 's help , decided to pay no attention to them . There would be no settlements , anyway , until the crop was in ; and the negroes on Philip 's place , she knew , never had understood what their marks on the contracts implied , anyhow . Some more white folks ' notions , they supposed , and obediently set crosses beside their names , as Cavin told them to do . Most of them stayed at home now doing their work about as usual . True , a few of the younger slaves interpreted their freedom to mean freedom from labor ; and these Letitia told to leave , makingone firm rule from which she never varied : no work , no rations . She was quick , however , to supply extra food and bright new clothes to any who kept their cotton clean , and , on the whole , had little trouble with the field hands . She was glad , however , when August came to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confer every morning with her and Matt . After this part of ' the clay 's routine was disposed of ; the remaininghours seemed to him intolerably long . He was not a reader , like his father ; by instinct he was fonder of action than of meditation . But with time hanging on his hands , as it now did , he found himself thinking oftener and oftener of what was going on in the state . Well , at least we 're making some progress , ' he meditated . The way we carried the Throckmorton election showed that . Now if we can only get the best clement on both sides to pulling together . ' He recalled hearing William say that certain citizens of the Republic always kept three flags flying on the masts of their sailing vessels  --  those of the Republic , of England , and of the United States . ' Rut they always flew the Lone Star at the top , ' he meditated ,  |p349remembering  how , ever since the war , the Confederates had taken to raising the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees seemed either not to recognize the banner or not to object to it . That 's the flag Judge Dickerson nailed up in his court , ' Cavin recalled . That 's the flag that flies from the post in the square at Berryville . ' I do n't know why I did n't see how to manage before , ' his thoughts ran on . We 've all got to think about Texas , now , not about the United States or the Confederacy . We 've got to go on from where we are , whether we like it or not . God knows we do n't like it , ' his sombre thoughts flowed on , but that ca n't be helped . ' As he lay there sorting and arranging his ideas , he was exasperatedby his inability to be up , putting them into operation , now that they were fully clear to him . It never occurred to him , as it so often had to Philip , that his undertakings might as easily fail as succeed . Because he had read so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his optimism , not his courage , more exuberant . He was too tired and in too much pain to follow with any degreeof accuracy the reports that began to come in from John McGaughey sitting in the legislature at Austin . Even so , hr rejoiced , like everyone else , when he heard that President . Johnson had declared Reconstruction over in Texas . August ' toth was a day , he thought , that Texans would have to put down on their calendars to celebrate like San Jacinto Day . Now we can go about our business , thank the Lord , ' he reflected , with a satisfying sense of release . I lutist talk things over with Lucy , ' he decided , and then remembered with a shock of surprise and regret that the last time he had tried to talk to her she had not been at all interested in his plans for testing new varieties of cotton . P350 He could hardly believe that the pale , listless , and holloweyedgirl who answered only Yes ' or No ' or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucina whose agile mind , before this , had usually expanded his ideas before he had clearly formulated them , himself . His son was over a month old before he saw him , still in a basket between warm bricks . And then he was afraid to touch him . Whenever he looked at the baby or its mother , he was forced to meditate on how many drawbacks there were to the usual method of populating the world . As September passed , however , he realized thankfully that he was learning how to manage his crippled leg . By the end of the month , he was able to mount his horse , and then he began to feel a whole man again . He was well enough , now , to follow the debate going on in the legislature over the " Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States . The legislators showed good sense , he thought , in accepting the first measure , thus concedingslavery to he a dead issue , but he admired them for rejectingthe second entirely , declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white man 's country , ' he declared , and they might as well learn it , first as last . ' He also approved of the new law by which a young negro could be bound out to long service , and fined for leaving his employerwithout the consent of the county judge . You ca n't have black boys running hog-wild , ' he reflected , and smiled . White boys either . ' But some of the new labor laws irritated and puzzled him . They must be trying to satisfy the Freedman'sBureau , up at Austin , ' he surmised shrewdly . Half the crop for the labor ! And fines for cruelty ! The Bureau 'll call it cruelty , of course , ' he predicted glumly , if a man puts hisp351negroes to work at all . Well , there 's no use trying to follow out such fool measures . They 'll never stand up in practice . ' He went , then , to look over his own contracts , drawn up before he fell ill . He saw that a few called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his supplying his hands in full and allowing them one-quarter or one-third of the crop as pay for their labor . That 's somewhere about right , I reckon , ' Cavin ruminated . How 's anybody to know ? It 's bound to be hit and miss for a long time . Already it 's pretty clear that I 'm going to have to look out for my people  --  the same as always  --  and pay ' em besides . ' He sighed . Well , there 's nothing to do but keep on . One Saturday morning , about the middle of October , he told his field hands to begin coming up to his office next day to go over their accounts . Accounts ? ' they inquired . Whut 's dem ? ' Most of them had no idea what he was talking about . One of the younger negroes , however , had been riding into town at night , and he began to grumble . How 's I gwine-a know whether I'se gittin ' all 's comin ' to me ? ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impudent manner . Gavin looked him over calmly . Get off my place , Jupiter , ' he warned him . I ' 11 leave your pay at the army post in the morning . ' The negro was startled at the turn affairs had taken . Whir 's I gwine ? ' he inquired , dropping his hoe and his insolence in one gesture . That 's no business of mine any more , ' Gavin replied . Hurry up , get off my place . ' Well , ' said Gavin to himself , watching Jupiter 's retreatingP352figure , once I'd-a had to go to the bother of selling that rascal . He 's been swelling up , looking for trouble for a month . ' He watched the negro until he was out of sight , then turned to the other hands . Anybody else want to quit ? ' he inquired . You 're free , now , you know , free to stay or to go . Well , get this straight , then , ' he warned them sternly , seeing that nobody made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place , you do what I say  --  the way you always have . ' Catching a loud murmur of assent , he smiled . All right , I see you understand . We 'll get along , ' he said comfortably . If we do n't , you 're fired , that 's all , and you 'll stay fired , too . You remember that , ' he cautioned them . You can quit , that 's true , any time you want to , but I do n't have to take care of you any more unless I want to . ' He sat his horse , watching them , until he saw they had taken in the tenor of his remarks . You all know I 'll do the best I can for you . ' There was a vigorous nodding of heads . Then he began to explain to them the system he had devised while he was bedridden. lc showed them the ledgers in which he had set aside a page for every man and woman on his place . Then he told them how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had always worked , but he would have to figure out , according to the contracts , the share of the crop which belonged to them . I lc would also have to figure out , he told them , what each man owed him , at current prices , for the supplies advanced since the contracts were drawn up . Already Cavin knew that there was not going to be much difference , in actual practice , between operating his plantation this way and in the old way . Only a lot more fuss and bother  --  and bookkeeping , ' he thought half in amusement and half in irritation , as he rode homeward . I wish to God the damn Yankees who thought up all these fancy ideas , had to keep my place going for about a month . ' P353Automatically , he began to estimate how heavy a percentage of his year 's profit would now be taken up by the bribe William had had to pay to a young official at the Freedman 's Bureau to get the contracts he carried with him accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll all probably have to count on more and more of that kind of business . Did n't David tell me he had to bribe the port inspector , too , to get his cotton put on the boat ? ' His mind nourished few illusions . Our own people 'll get onto the racket , ' he thought dismally . Might as well acknowledge it . ' As he got down from Pilot , using now the platform from which the ladies mounted their horses , he rubbed his sore hip reflectively . Maybe it 'll turn out they did do us a good turn , in the long run , by freeing the slaves . That is , if they 'll look after ' em . They wo n't , though , ' he reminded himself , recalling how , although the Freedman 's Bureau had set aside a large fund for sick negroes , yet this charge had been laid firmly back on each individual planter . If they 're so hell-bent on freeing ' em , they ought to have to pay for their pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost plenty of money and trouble . ' Flinging his reins to Jake , he walked toward the gate , stud yingthe ground . He had lifted the latch before he saw that Lucina was coming down the path to meet him , with the baby in her arms . Quickening his step , he stooped to kiss her , and together they bent over the child , who searched his father 's f u r with eyes that narrowed , like Lucina 's , to an oval at their corners . Lucy , ' said Cavin , straightening himself ' after a long scrutiny , I 'm about ready to say this chap 's worth what he cost . ' He tucked his son under one arm , with careless surety , and drew Lucina under the other . That night , as twilight began to gather , he went in and took Beauford from Maria , and then joined Letitia and Lucina in the flower garden , where they were sitting , playing with the youngesttwins , Philip and Philippa . It was as warm as summer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a norther might be expected at any time . Sitting down on the long bench that edged the garden fence , he held Beauford critically up against Philip 's son . He 's catching up , all right , ' he said , pleased with the comparison . Letitia made no reply , nor did Lucina . Glancing up , he saw their gaze was fixed on the avenue down which a man was galloping  --  a man on a dappled roan horse . He and Lucina reached over , at the same moment , for the twins , and , rising instantly , without thought , went inside the house together , with the children in their arms . That morning , when Povey stepped out into his garden , he looked at the autumn sun streaming warm and golden over his land , and called out to I lot ace , on a sudden impulse , to saddle his horse . The negro responded at once to the rising inflection in his master 's voice and looked up swiftly . Huccome you so happy , Mas ' Povey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm goin ' to find out , Horace . Tell Aunt Cindy I 'll take breakfast at Holly Grove . ' William was drinking his coffee in the arbor when Povey rode up . Raising his hand in salutation , he invited Povey to get down and have a cup with him . Breakfast too , ' Povey replied , alighting and opening the gate . I did n't stop for it at home . ' William spoke to the darky who was working around the flower beds in the yard . P355Tell Aunt Mary to send back the spoon-bread and bacon , Ranse . ' He leaned forward to scan Povey 's face . What 's on your mind ? ' William , ' Povey began , sitting down in a chair directly oppositehis host and gazing straight at him , I 'm alive and talking to you this morning because of Philip . I 'm not forgetting that . ' He paused while William looked unsmilingly at him across the huge saucer in which his own coffee was cooling . I had decided , ' Povey began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gazed off across the cottonfields where the dead , brown stalks now followed one after the other , like soldiers drawn up in long lines . Then the way things were , I saw it was no time  --  thank you , Ranse , ' he said interruptinghimself to take the tray the darky handed him . Putting it down on the seat beside him , he forgot it , as he laid both hands heavily on William 's knee . I 've come over to tell you -- William put down his saucer . The minute I saw you get down off your horse , I knew what you had in mind , Povey . ' His voice was not happy . You 'll have to remember she 's my own blood  --  the closest I 've got in the world . Five children  --  I d o n ' t know . ' He hesitated . You 've been separated a long time . ' Povey met his eyes steadily . I know . You do n't suppose I have n't thought of all that ? What does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now . I 'm no boy . I know what life 's like . ' William leaned back in his chair , looking so long at the horizonthat Povey impatiently got up and started fur his horse . He had not believed he would ever again feel the eager expectationthat now possessed him . William called him back , and rose to meet him . Go on , Povey , ' he said , looking at him intently . You seem to have thought it all out . ' He detained him for a moment longer , seeming to be uncertain how best to say what he had to say . Finally he put his thought into slow words . Tell Cavin I had a long talk with his father about this very thing , one morning in my cotton field last summer . ' His eyes searched Povey 's face , and then he held out his hand . God knows , I hope it 's not too late . ' Povey was halfway home before he realized the implication of William 's concluding remarks . Then he drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dark fields , and feeling an odd , harsh sympathy welling up in him for Philip , for himself , for every man alive . A moment longer he sat still . Then he lifted his reins , and Xanthus fell into the quick , pacing step that he usually followed . When Povey got home , he sent Horace back to tell Aunt Cindy he had not , after all , had his breakfast at Holly Grove . Fust he say he wo n't an ' den he say he will , Aunt Cindy , ' Horace reported . Sumpin ' brewing aroun ' heah , but I cai n't make out whut it is . ' Aunt Cindy looked him over scornfully . You is a plum fool , den , ' she told him . You better clean up dis-heah yand tell it shines . ' Horace 's mouth fell open . I declare fo ' Jesus , ' he replied , I is a fool , lak you say . ' He went out meditating , and , a few hours later , when Povey sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press his clothes , Horace grinned . I done ' tended to all dat , suh . An ' put a extry shine on Xanthus , an ' raked de yand , an ' swep ' de galleries . ' Povey looked up at his servant , with an amused smile hoveringon his lips . No use trying to keep anything from you , II ) race . '  |p357'Nam-sub  , ' Horace agreed . bat 's so . ' He paused on one foot , uncertainly . Aunt Cindy want to know , is you ' specting company fur supper ? ' Go on , ' said Povey . Go on , you imp o ' Satan ; I 'll let you both know in plenty of time . ' He began to hum as he went into his office to look over some papers . It had been years since he had felt so young and happy . Tonight , after supper , I 'll ride over , ' he planned . When he came out of his room in the late afternoon , Xanthus was tied at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . He knows I wo n't want him tonight , ' Povey thought , and mounted his horse , breaking into a swift gallop . Seven years since I spoke to her ! ' he thought , spurring Xanthus  --  a thing he seldom did . His throat and mouth were dry , every muscle tense , when he got down at Philip 's gate . For a moment he stood there completely still , as Letitia rose to her feet , with one hand half outstretched . Taking a step toward him she too paused , motionless . Am I dreaming ? ' she asked herself . I must be . ' Slowly , lilt began to pour back into her . If it 's a dream , ' she told herself , I 'll wake up . I always do . ' At sight of her , a quiet that Povey had forgotten stole over him , and , opening the gate , he walked toward her , holding out his arms . She took a single , halting step and touched his sleeve ; and then raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to test her sight . Suddenly joy broke across her feat u es like a flood of blinding light . There is a glory not of this world , ' Povey told himself as his arms fell around her .   The soft dusk passed over into night , and the stars moved across the dark sky , but they scarcely spoke . This is how the dead must feel on the Resurrection Morn , Letitia thought once , and then she thought no more , as , caught up , like Elijah , in a chariot of fire , she felt the heavens opening and closing about her . When Povey reached home that night , Horace was asleep . Povey did not wake him , but unsaddled his horse himself ; and went in to bed , but not to sleep . Finally toward daylight he got up and dressed and began going through his house , carrying a lighted lamp with him . Looking around at his office where books , maps , and papers were mingled in dusty confusion , he was suddenly ashamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let this place alone , ' he fumed . It did n't seem to ncatter , until now . ' Ile passed , then , into his parlor  --  a square room full of an odd assortment of ' furniture that his uncle had accumulated . There were peacock fans iii the centre of the mantel and dried grasses in white fluted vases at each end , but the room was as dead and cold as all unused rooms come to be . I ' 11 send to New Orleans fir wallpaper tomorrow , ' he resolved . Letitia will know what to do . ' At the thought , his heart pounded within his breast . When light broke , he was in a fever . Anything might have happened , ' he told himself unreasonably , and swung himself up on Xanthus . Anybody up yet ? ' he asked Aunt Emmy , walking into the kitchen at Locust Hill . I 'll be here for breakfast . ' Miss Lettie , ' she answered him . Looks lak she ai n't slep ' none . Mas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Povey ? ' she inquiredpolitely . I 'll set you a plate . ' P359I never felt so well in my life , Aunt Emmy . ' Dat 's good . ' The old woman paused in her tracks and , dartinga sharp glance in his direction , laid her hands on her enormouships . I ai n't got de sense of a jay bird . Lawd bless you , Mas ' Povey , you an ' her bofe . ' Povey ran his hand in his pocket . Take this fir a wedding present , Aunt Emmy , ' he told her , and went out whistling . He found Letitia in the flower garden , and took her in his arms so urgently that she was startled . Are you all right ? ' he asked her . Look at me , Lettie . Let me see if you are . ' He kissed her again and again . Darling , ' he exclaimed brokenly , holding her off . Every minute I 'm away from you , I 'm in torment . ' His gaze caressed her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told her , more quietly , watching the pulse in her white throat . Seven years I was dead , ' he told her ; now I 'm alive , ' and dropped his lips on hers . Letitia laid both hands on his cheeks . Her eyes were deeply blue . I know , ' she said softly . Her bright hair shone under the sunlight , and fell about her face . Povey bent his head closer . The Bishop 's in Berryville . I could ride down ' His voice implored her . Do n't you see , I can never leave you again ? ' She was smiling , running her fingers lightly over the outline of his face . The same eyes , ' she thought , loving the way the pupils widened and darkened the clear gray that surrounded them . The same hair ! ' Lightly she touched it , brushing it off his forehead . Still she could not tell whether it was more brown than red . She traced the delicate oblong of ' his lips with her finger-tips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden , ' she breathed . P36o His eyes darkened and his breath caught in his throat . This evening ? ' She shook her head . You 'll get back too late . In the morn-ing . ' No , ' he said , whenever I get back . It 's been too long , al-ready . ' Too long , ' she echoed . Yes , too long . ' The past flooded into her mind . Since last night , it had dropped out of her consciousness . For twelve hours , now , she had been nineteen again , unconscious of sorrow . She clung to him now , suddenly cold and shivering . Seven years  --  seven eternities ! ' exclaimed Povey , holding her off from him to look at her , and to feel again the joy that shook him whenever he drew her back into the circle of his arms . A day 's too long ! ' he whispered . An hour 's too long ! ' She leaned against him , shivering again , feeling faint and dizzy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pallor , and that her lips were blue . It 's nothing . ' She laughed up at him . Happiness , may-be . ' Lifting her , he carried her in to the dining-room . Lucina wrapped her in blankets and Povey made a fire in the fireplace . After she had swallowed a cup of hot coffee , the color began to come back to her cheeks . Go on , ' she urged him , then . Go on , Povey , so you can hurry back . Get your breakfast before you start , ' she said , smiling up at him with lips that were beginning to be warm again . Breakfast ! ' he exclaimed . And again , Breakfast ! ' He laughed down at her , his eyes shining . What do I need with breakfast ? ' He felt on fire , like a man with wings . ' Go on , then , ' she urged him again . Go on , while I can let you go . ' P361She was too tired to move . All morning she lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought she knew now what the saints were always talking about when they spoke of a new heaven and a new earth . This floating happiness must take you there . But toward afternoon another chill began to shake her  --  this time so relentlessly that the movement of her clothes over her skin was agony . Lucina tapped the bell for Aunt Elvy . Help me get her to bed , ' she said , frightened by Letitia 's pinched face . Aunt Elvy groaned , and hurried to heat salt and to wrap up hot stove lids in newspapers and towels . It would take more than that , though , she knew , to drive away the congestivechill which precedes black jaundice  --  a disease she had too often fought now to mistake its symptoms . Cavin sent Jake on Pilot for David . No telling where he would find him ; he might have to ride after him all day . He himself set off for Berryville to overtake Povey . David , however , was just dismounting at his front gate when Jake galloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' David exclaimed aghast . What else can happen at Locust Hill ? ' Grabbing his case , he shifted to the fresh horse that was always tied at his gate , and he and Jake raced back toward the river , their horses ' necks stretching even . When he entered the room , Letitia smiled wanly up at him , and he saw that she knew this was no ordinary illness she was suffering from . Do n't let me die , ' she pleaded with him . I ca n't die now , David . ' As he galloped into Berryville , Cavin met Povey and the Bishop just starting home . At sight of him , they pulled up their horses sharply , and Povey looked once into Cavin 's face , then spurred Xanthus till he plunged in fright .   What is it ? ' he asked , leaning out of his saddle . My God , man , what is it ? ' Letitia , ' said Cavin . His tongue was heavy in his mouth . He could say no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand on Cavin 's pommel as Povey dashed ahead , leaning low across his horse 's neck . ' Gavin , ' the Bishop asked , his shoulders drooping , how is a man to understand God ? ' They followed close behind , and saw Povey throw himself out of his saddle and pause for a moment in front of the long window that opened onto the gallery from Letitia 's room , and then go in . David glanced up as he entered . You 'd better stay , ' he said . Povey dropped into a chair by the bed , feeling cold and stunned , as if every emotion had suddenly drained out of him . There 's nothing I can do for him , ' David thought , and centredhis mind on Letitia , the progress of whose illness he seemed unable to halt . He had a feeling , as he had had with Philip , that he was beaten , from the beginning . But he refused to acknowledge defeat to himself . Almost , he thought , you could see Letitia rallying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her eyes and recognized those around her . Povey , ' she said once that night , and David could feel the resolve that strengthened her fluttering pulse . For three days , the unequal battle kept up . The last night , she looked straight up into Povey 's face , and smiled as he lifted her into his arms . I can do no more , ' said David , and left them . Not since he had practised medicine had he felt the despair that overwhelmed him now . What had he left undone ? What had he not tried ?  |p363He  sat in the dark , just outside the room , sunk in a bitter , unavailinggrief . Why did he pretend to be a doctor at all ? he wondered , forgetting other lives he had snatched from the grave . The Bishop joined him there , and Cavin and Lucina . Togetherthey watched the stars grow pale . We 'd better go in , ' said David at last , and , entering the room , knelt to look closely at Letitia 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anyone 's gaze than was in David 's , when he looked up at his friend . She 's gone , Povey , ' he said . She 's already gone . ' For a long time Povey sat there , unable to move , but at last he rose slowly , like a man in a trance , and with infinite care laid his burden in Cavin 's arms . Then , without a word , he walked out of the room with the swaying motion of a drunken man . The Bishop followed him , and , when he caught up with him , said gently , Let me come with you , Povey . ' The swaying figure kept straight on , and the Bishop laid his hand again on his arm , repeating his request . Yes , certainly , ' Povey said courteously . If you like . ' All that night he rode his horse through the bottoms , and I next day he stood at Letitia 's grave so far withdrawn into his grief that no one ventured even to speak to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clays or the next few months . The Bishop often had the feeling that Povey lived , if he lived at all , in another world , that only his body walked and moved about on this earth . He seemed more like a wraith than a man . Sometimes he would get up and sit motionless , till the sun rose , under his live-oaks and his chinaberries . He talked very little , and always gently . His friends did not know how to break the silence that even the Bishop was unable to penetrate before he was called back to Carolina by illness in his family . He don ' eat an ' he don ' sleep , ' Aunt Cindy moaned to John McGaughey , who , after his return from Austin in December , came over to call at Land 's End . Povey welcomed him , but it was clear that he preferred to be alone . John soon rose and left , and Povey did not appear even to be aware of his going . On his way home , John stopped by David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he demanded , with his usual brisk efficiency . Nothing , ' David replied , sadly . Nothing . I do n't know what to think , ' he confessed . Of course there 's his old wound and his cough ' He broke off despairingly . Everybody 's read about a living death , but mighty few have seen it . ' John rock home deeply despondent . When you look at life straight , he reflected , what sense does it make ? After Christmas , David spent more and more time at Land 's End , where Policy lay day after day scarcely stirring in his high bed . One morning the bright warm blood took his breath . How long ? ' he asked David , and appeared to welcome the answer he received . Then he asked for a piece of paper and a pen . Land 's End is for her children , of course , ' he said , but I 'd better make it clear . ' Handing the pen back , he sank on his pillows , relieved . Do n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What does it matter ? ' There 's nothing to work on , ' David reported to William , one night when he came to take his turn nursing . William sighed heavily . I 've known that for a long time . ' Early in March , Povey failed so rapidly that David moved over to Land 's End , but his patient clung to life with a tenacity that surprised them both . P365It 's a long time coming , ' Povey said one morning . It was the only complaint he ever made . The last night of his life Cavin was with him , and David and Aunt Cindy , his nurse , and Horace . It was a pouring night late in March , and the rain slashed against the windows . They turned down the light and put an envelope in front of the chimneyto shade his eyes . Toward morning , he began to talk a little , lightly and happily . Aunt Cindy leaned over him , listening . It do n't make no sense , ' she said , lifting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and softened , as if merged by the tears that had flowed over them . Seem lak Mas ' Povey jes ' talkin ' ' bout pidgens  --  pidgens flyin ' in de sun . ' But when William entered the quiet room , just before daylighthe understood what recollections were crossing Povey 's mind . Lord , if he has to die , let him die now , ' he prayed . And , as if his prayer were answered , Povey breathed a sigh , opened his eyes and smiled , a happy , peaceful smile , and never moved again . Lavin rode home just as the sun was beginning to climb in the sky . The air was soft and warm and wet , f u l l of the odor of ' pushingshoots and new green leaves and freshly ploughed eat t h . Never , he thought , had the world looked more beautiful ; and suddenly it seemed to him strange past all belief that nature should be so indifferent to the death of a man like Pow ,  --  a man , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wrong , for anybody to find life harsher than death . Deep in Cavin , something revolted at the idea of extinction , of ceasing to be able to move upon the sunny earth and subdue it to his will . He had not lived close enough to the ancients , as Philip had , to acquire something of their fatality , of the detachment which enabled Lucian to poke jibes at the gray , aimless shades he was
