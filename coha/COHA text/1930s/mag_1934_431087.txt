THE assembled bank officials were hushed , expectant , tense . At long last , the fair name of their bank , the greatest in the United States , was to be retrieved . Its new head , Mr. Aldrich , was to expound to the Senators and to the throng in the huge hearing room in Washington a reform program for his bank and for all banks . The rescue of the bank came none too soon . Week after week Ferdinand Pecora , the lawyer of the Senate Banking Committee , had been presenting evidence of the bank 's doings under its former chief , Albert H. Wiggin . The bank , The Chase National Bank of New York , had been held responsible , in the view of the entire country , for all sorts of deals . The shock of the exposure was all the worse because the bank 's lawyers had spent so many years , and written so many documents , to preserve it from responsibility . This also had been held against the bank , the more so because for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been showing their exercise of great power with a minimum of responsibility . This problem of irresponsibility in high finance was one of those on which some of Mr. Aldrich 's auditors were hoping that he would speak when he expounded his new creed for that select company of big financiers who govern the savings and investments of the whole nation . Mr. Aldrich rose to the occasion and met the question squarely . He said : " The immediate and direct responsibility for preventing the recurrence of faulty conditions which have been disclosed here and elsewhere rests upon those of us who are engaged in the management of commercial banking institutions .... The officers of our commercial banking institutions should have constantly before them a realization of their great responsibilities to the public . " The banker pledged his bank to the principles he had laid down , including the principle of responsibility commensurate with the power exercised by great institutions . Turning to the Senators , he tendered his unconditional pledge in these words : " As for the Chase National Bank , I can say without qualification that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the standards I have just outlined . " His words were spoken as the year 1933 was drawing to its close . Within six months his bank had the chance to make good on his promise , and other great Wall Street banks also had the chance to show whether they would subscribe to the necessary new doctrine ? the doctrine that big bankers and corporate directors who control the billions of dollars of assets owned by the public should give up their former irresponsibility and should accept full responsibility , equal to the power they  |p707  exercise . Let us consider what they did in this , the first year of the new reform era for big-scale finance . In May the Chase National Bank had to deal with the question of the responsibility of directors of large corporations . It had been approached by the officers and directors of an $80 , - 000,000 company , Virginia Electric and Power Company . This company wanted to get bondholders to accept certain of the company 's bonds in exchange for other bonds they held . The Virginia company already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , and proposed to issue some $8,000,000 additional for the purpose of the deal it wanted to make . In order to do all this , the Virginia company had to make arrangements with the Chase National Bank , which is trustee for the owners of the Virginia company 's bonds . The Chase Bank had become trustee in 1925 . At that time one of the questions before the corporation and the Chase Bank was whether corporation officials should be personally subject to liability on the bonds in case the corporation should later be unable to pay . The usual attitude with respect to this question is that if the corporation 's officials manage its affairs properly they ought not to be personally liable on the bonds . Provision was made for this protection of the company 's directors and officers . However , in doing so the company and the Chase Bank used words much broader than necessary for that purpose , words broad enough to throw grave doubt on the right to have recourse for the benefit of bondholders against directors and officers for wrongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bondholders that this right shall be clearly available to them at all times . When more of the bonds were to be issued in 1934 , the Virginia company and the Chase Bank had to decide whether the words used in 1925 should be reaffirmed , so as to bind also the investors in the new bond issue . Between 1925 and 1934 the financial community had received ample proof of the value of holding corporate officers and directors subject to ordinary liabilities . During those years many corporations had gone into receivership , and there had been clear testimony showing the mismanagement of some of them by their directors and officers . Particularly had this happened where the corporation issuing the bonds was part of a public utilities chain . In such cases there have been holding companies , operating companies , and management and service companies , and there has been in some cases considerable siphoning of assets out of operating companies into holding and service companies , in order to enable them to survive the depression . The Virginia Electric and Power Company is part of a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The problem with which the Chase Bank was dealing , therefore , should have recalled recent instances of the need for granting the clearest possible protection to bondholders against the results of any possible mismanagement of the type described above . The bank was thus called upon to decline to repeat in 1934 the unnecessarily broad language to which it agreed in 1925 . The Chase Bank decided , however , in the post-Wiggin period , to reaffirm all it had done before . As in 1925 , so now the bank agreed that the company 's promoters , officers , and directors should be freed from various types of liability , including " any and all personal liability of every name and nature , whether ... by statute or by constitution or otherwise . . . to respond by reason of ... any act of omission or commission on his part or otherwise , for the pay/ ment for or to the Company or any receiver thereof or for or to the holder of any bond or coupon issued or secured hereunder or otherwise , of any sum that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bank did the same for all the directors , officers , and promoters of every corporation controlled now or at any time in the future by the Virginia company . Even if the Virginia company owned only a minority interest in any other company , the directors , officers , and promoters of that company were also to be exempted . Nor was all this deemed enough . The charter of liberties thus conferred on directors and financiers was not to be limited simply to those in office this year . The bank decreed that the exemption should apply to everyone who had ever been a director , officer , or promoter of any of these companies , to everyone already in office , and to everyone who might hold any of these offices in the future . A bondholder may ask how any bank can have such power . All that he need do to get his answer is to go behind the scenes and watch the financial wheels go round . He already knows that when a man buys a bond he is simply lending money to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a large bond issue the buyer is merely one of thousands who have similarly lent their money to the same corporation . To protect every such concourse of bondholders , financiers decided many years ago that the borrowing corporation must be subjected to limitations , much as is a motorist driving among thousands of pedestrians . Whenever a bond issue was created , or is created to-day , rules are customarily made to govern the behavior and activities of the company , so that the bondholders shall be safeguarded , and so that the company may do nothing to damage their investment at any time during the period until it falls due and is paid . These rules are printed , in practically every case , in a book called an indenture . These rules books are the product of the joint authorship of large borrowing corporations , large investment dealers who sell their bonds to the public , and large banks , mainly the dozen biggest in New York City . The role of the banks is the dual role of legislator and policeman . They help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see to it that the borrowing company obeys those rules . Whenever a large bond issue is to be created by such a company , it selects a bank , generally a mammoth New York institution , to perform this service for the people who are going to buy the bonds or to receive them in exchange for other bonds . The bank is named the trustee for the bondholders . In the making and enforcing of the rules they are its wards ; it is their guardian . Unfortunately , in the past , some financial lawyers changed the nature of these rules books . They put limitations on the buyers of the bonds , even more than on the companies selling the bonds . The bonds were made subject to the indenture , and the indenture said plenty to protect , not so much the bondholders from the directors and officers of the corporation , as the directors and officers from the bondholders . In the topsy-turvy financial world of recent times the rules in these indentures often provided not safety but jeopardy for the owners of the bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees fell in with the views of a number of lawyers drafting such documents . Some of the banks departed in other ways from the high level of carefulness and faithfulness to which trustees have for hundreds of years been compelled to adhere , both by their own consciences and by the  |p709  courts . To be sure , when they drafted the indentures , they plastered these documents with a great deal of talk about trusteeship and trusts and the trust estate , and much of the other language that lawyers and judges have used for some centuries in connection with the work and the duties of trustees . But somehow or other , on occasion after occasion one bank or another had become during the evil days of the past somewhat slack in the performance of these trusts . Indeed , there crept into the talk of some financial lawyers the suggestion that these banks , which had been announcing to the world for so many years that they were trustees for the bondholders , were not trustees at all , or at any rate were trustees quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks were in a position to show whether they were going to treat themselves as real trustees or merely as paper trustees . If they drafted the indentures or rules books for the thorough-going protection of the bondholders , the public would get considerable evidence that it was going to be in much safer hands than before . If , on the contrary , the banks reissued practically the same rules books as before , the public might be inclined to feel that the old spirit and the old practices from which it had suffered would reappear . In the case earlier mentioned , that of the Virginia Electric and Power Company , the Chase National Bank showed that it was inclined to cling very closely to the type of indentures that had formerly been used . The bank arranged , by a method well-known in Wall Street , to require the new bondholders to grant the same immunities for corporation officials as in the past . The bank agreed with the company that any man who received one of the bonds should by that very act make a contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which reads that " it is part of the contract herein contained " that each bondholder " by the acceptance " of the bond frees the corporate officials from liabilities " all as more fully provided in the Indenture . " The indenture specified the liabilities from which the officials were to be exempted . Such documents are construed by financial lawyers as creating a contract on the part of the bond buyer , in which he agrees to the exemptions of the directors , officers , and promoters . This is the traditional method of maneuvering security holders into surrendering rights they may have against the men in control of large corporate properties . This thing was done , not by one of the worst , but by one of the best banks . To be sure it had got a black eye at the Senate Committee hearings , but it emerged from them repentant and redeemed . Its new chief had confessed its old sins and had dissociated the bank forever from its recent past . He was in a position to speak for it . Indeed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank had not yet seen the statement of reform he was about to read , they would support everything he said . His reform program , therefore , won for his bank almost as high a standing as his words conferred on himself . Such was his achievement , on that memorable occasion a year ago , that some of the coldest intellects in the inquiry room , some of the hardest-hearted newspaper men at the press table , calloused and disillusioned by the story of the Wiggin regime at the bank , hailed Mr. Aldrich as the outstanding friend of the investors of America . It is , therefore , to be assumed that his bank proceeded in its work this year on as high a plane as is to be found in Wall Street . Such is , in fact , the case . What it did , the other banks did . The spirit animating the Chase Bank in its deal with the Virginia Electric and  |p710  Power Company is the spirit that ran through all such deals in the financial district this year . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just described , there was a comparable transaction between another public utility , Atlanta Gas Light Company , and another New York bank , New York Trust Company . This bank like the Chase , is one from which bondholders may expect the best that Wall Street has to offer . For years the directorate of New York Trust Company has included partners of such firms as J. P. Morgan &; Co . The head of the bank , Mortimer N. Buckner , is among the leaders in high finance , high up in the New York Clearing House Association , and much in demand as a director of corporations when things are going well and as a member of protective committees for security holders when things are going badly . His bank agreed , in an indenture prepared in June , that the directors and officers of the Atlanta public utility company should be protected , as follows ( the quotation is from the language of the bond , as printed in the indenture ) : " No recourse shall be had for the payment . . . of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or through the company .. . under any rule of law , statute , constitution , or by the enforcement of any assessment , or otherwise my italics , all such liability . . . being released by the year of reform been conferring upon corporate officials such rights as have been mentioned , the banks have also been giving themselves certain rights . This readiness of the big banks to treat themselves as well as they treat corporation executives may be illustrated by a deal made in June between Illinois Central Railroad Company and the Bank of Manhattan . This , also , is a great New York institution , like the Chase , under the leadership of a financial reformer . The vicechairman of the Bank of Manhattan is James P. Warburg , a banker who has been urging the government and the people to avoid monetary practices which he strongly condemns . He has written articles , published a book , and made speeches in order to persuade the country to follow monetary principles he deems sound . Meantime his bank was accommodating both itself and the Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The railroad company was at the time unable to pay off what it owed to the holders of $20,000,000 of its notes that were falling due . To meet the difficulty , it borrowed $7,500,000 from the government , offered this money to the security holders as 371/2 per cent part payment , and asked them to take $12,500,000 of new securities for the balance . The railroad selected Bank of Manhattan as trustee for the owners of the new securities . The bank recognized that it would have the duty of acting for the security holders in the event that the railroad company did not perform the various promises it was making for their protection . This might be troublesome for the bank . It would be troublesome to act . It would be troublesome not to act , because the bank might be sued by a security holder if it failed to act . The bank 's attorneys resorted to methods well-known among financial lawyers . Under the provisions of the indenture , the bank could in effect put on blinders and refuse to see what it actually did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its promises , the bank could assume that the company  |p711  was doing no such thing . Nothing could make it take off these blinders until the owners of 5 per cent of the securities ran and told the bank what it already knew . This is usually a firstrate protection against the ordinary investor . He is not in a position to know when a big corporation breaks its promises , and even if he does learn this fact , he is usually unable to get the names and addresses of other holders of the securities , so as to line up the owners of 5 per cent of the bonds . The bank did not take even this risk . It provided for itself another avenue of escape from liability to its wards . It put into the indenture a provision that it should be free from any obligation to act unless some of the security holders would give it " reasonable security and indemnity against " the expense of taking action . The average security holder could not do this . Bank services and bank lawyers come high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardy enough to go up to the bank and deposit the amount the bank might ask would have to be ready to pay more as often as the bank required them to do so . The bank did not need these provisions to insure its getting paid for what it did . It provided in the indenture that the railroad company should pay all the bank 's fees and expenses . The bank may have felt , however , the need of these provisions in order to be protected against the obligation to act and against liability if it did not act . Even this protection was deemed insufficient . The indenture had a provision that the bank should not be required to act unless the holders of 25 per cent of the securities asked it to do so . How would so large a number of ordinary investors know that there was anything wrong and know how to get in touch with one another ? Still the men who wrote this document were not satisfied . One of the great distinguishing characteristics of these indentures , now as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss safeguards for bank trustees or for corporation executives . The lawyers for the Bank of Manhattan conceived the possibility that by some extraordinary combination of circumstances , owners of 5 per cent of the securities might know one another 's names and addresses , might get together , and might tell the bank that things had gone wrong ; that the owners of 25 per cent of the securities might get together and ask it to act ; and that they might be ready to give the bank indemnity and security as often as it required . The lawyers put something else into the indenture . The bank , unless it wilfully misconducts itself or is guilty of gross negligence , is not to be liable " for anything whatever in connection with this trust . " Liability for losses caused by the bank 's plain negligence ( which lawyers and judges recognize to be quite different from gross negligence ) , plain incompetence , the sort of liability that would compel the ordinary trustee to reimburse his wards for any losses he caused them , is washed away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect the Warburg bank from its wards . So the indenture said that the bank should have the right to consult a lawyer . If it followed his advice in good faith it was to be free from any liability to bondholders for what it did . To quote the indenture : " The trustee may advise with counsel and shall be protected in respect of any action under this indenture taken in good faith by the trustee in accordance with the opinion of counsel . " The need for caution , for skill , for judgment , for knowledge of what was going on could thus all be blown out of the window by a lawyer 's breath . No ordinary man , still less a trustee obligated to protect others , could get such  |p712  absolution by a word from his own lawyer . The Bank of Manhattan also , of course , freed the directors and officers of the railroad company from liabilities , by various provisions , one of them reading as follows : " . . . any and all personal liability of every name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by statute , of , and any and all rights and claims against , every ... officer or director , as such , are hereby expressly waived as a condition of , and as consideration for , the execution of this indenture and the issue of the notes . " III The bank was called upon to act as trustee for another set of railroad security holders , some two months after it signed the indenture in the Illinois Central securities issue . The new job it got was a big one . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company was selling $50,000,000 of securities , one of the biggest corporation securities flotations in the year 1934 . About three-quarters of the new securities were distributed to the public by three of the most important investment or banking firms in the country , Kuhn Loeb &; Co. , Speyer &; Co. , and Brown Harriman &; Co . The first mentioned firm is the greatest creator and distributor of securities in America , since the retirement of J. P. Morgan 8c Co. from this branch of the business . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indenture for the protection of the buyers would have to be satisfactory to the attorneys for the Kuhn Loeb , Speyer , and Brown Harriman firms . This indenture was , therefore , avowedly one that had the sanction of those firms , of the Baltimore and Ohio , and of the Bank of Manhattan . The indenture protected the bank against liability , in much the same fashion as in the Illinois Central issue and practically all such cases . Protection was also extended to the officers and directors of the railroad company , as in some of the cases already described . At the time big New York banks were framing the indentures already mentioned , corporate finance still had one foot in the wreckage of the depression . Only a few companies dared to float new securities issues . Others , like Illinois Central Railroad , were unable to pay what they owed and were creating new securities to be offered to their security holders in substitution for what the latter already held . In such cases , the " frozen " condition of the companies emphasized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required the bank-trustees to be more careful than ever to protect their wards appropriately . The Illinois Central issue , already mentioned , is one such case . Another in which the bank-trustee took good care of itself is that of a $16,000,000 bond issue by North German Lloyd , the German shipping company . The trustee for the holders of these bonds is Chemical Bank &; Trust Company , one of the biggest New York banks . Its head , like the head of New York Trust Company , has been high in the affairs of the New York Clearing House and has been much sought for directorates of large financial and industrial concerns . The Chemical Bank under the terms of its indenture is not to be liable for any kind of negligence , but only for wilful or intentional default . Other customary safeguards against liability to bondholders are also included in the indenture . The example of the New York institutions would naturally be followed in those smaller cases in which other banks sometimes get a share of this business . In May of this year a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , par/ ticipated as trustee in drafting an indenture for the bonds of an industrial corporation which was asking its security-holders to give it additional time to pay its debts . The St. Louis bank preferred to adopt the language of those New York banks which free themselves from any liability for anything other than wilful misconduct . IV The presentation of examples of what is being done in the year 1934 may be concluded with one of the most important illustrations of all . It arises out of a flotation of $8,000,000 of bonds by Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation , a New York public utility . The trustee in this case is the Chase National Bank , already mentioned in connection with a bond issue of another public utility . The directors and bankers of Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit envisaged the possibility of becoming personally liable to purchasers of the new bonds , under the Securities Law passed by Congress in 1933 . This law requires disclosure of the facts about securities which are to be sold , so that buyers may be protected better than in the past , and it subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Congress exempted from this law certain purely intrastate sales of securities , not because it believed that security holders are less in need of protection in those cases , but because it was not sure that it had power to regulate such transactions . The bankers of the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation believed that they could so conduct themselves that they would be protected under this exception in the law . In making use of this loophole , the bankers adopted , according to reports in reliable New York newspapers , extraordinary precautions to sell the bonds only to investors in New York State . As part of their plan , they refrained from issuing a prospectus or offering circular descriptive of the new securities ? the method usually employed in the past to inform investors about bonds or shares offered for sale . Thus the bankers and directors of Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation did not rest content with sidestepping the new law that required financiers to do more than they used to do in disclosing the facts about new securities issues . To avoid this law , they did less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Such a plan was a direct slap in the face for the reform program which many great financiers had urged only a few months earlier . Richard Whitney , president of the New York Stock Exchange , and others of its high officials had told the United States Senate Committee that there should be the fullest disclosure . Many bankers , including Mr. Aldrich , had expressed the same view . A statement by him on the subject was especially called for , because the testimony had shown that in some flotations by the affiliate of the Chase Bank the prospectus or offering circular had not told all the facts to investors . Mr. Aldrich said he would have no truck with such methods of doing financial business . He indicated that on the flotation of securities the prospectus should make the fullest possible disclosure , that corporate directors and bankers should go the limit in this respect . In view of his stand , Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation was confronted with the question whether his bank would sign an indenture which was an incidental requisite of the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospectus , became known to Mr. Aldrich 's bank at least eighteen days before it signed . It signed without any conditions on this score .  |p714  However , despite the precautions taken by the company 's bankers , there was the possibility that they might fail in their effort to make use of the technical exception in the Securities Law , about intrastate transactions . Indeed , within two months Washington authorities intimated that the company 's officials or bankers may have got stuck midway as they were passing through the hole in the law . The indenture apparently met this contingency , by punching a bigger and better hole in the law . The words , broad enough to cover other statutory liability as well , are as follows : " No recourse shall be had for the payment of the . . . bonds . . . or for any claim based thereon . . . , or otherwise in respect thereof or of this trust indenture , against any .. . officer or director , as such , past , present , or future . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether by virtue of any statute or constitutional provision or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or otherwise . . . " In other words , Chase Bank , employing phraseology somewhat as in the days before the Securities Law , set up a rule to cancel the rule made by Congress . The bank did this in the very teeth of a Congressional decree that no one should have the power to erase the safeguards Congress had evolved for the benefit of security holders . Besides conferring immunities on the corporation 's directors and officers , the bank secured immunities for itself , phrased more broadly than in some of the indentures already mentioned . For instance , provision was made that Chase Bank " shall not be liable for any error of judgment , nor for any act done or steps taken or omitted by it , nor for any mistake of fact or law , nor for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith , except only for its wilful misconduct . " This was in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indentures of the current year . Chase Bank also went out of its way to assure special privileges to itself and its own officers . For instance , the indenture in the Brooklyn-Manhattan bond issue entitled the bank to exercise privileges which ordinary trustees deny to themselves . The bank was given the right to make its profit as trustee for the bondholders , and to make a profit also out of business in which it might acquire an interest inconsistent with its duty to the bondholders . Such an inconsistency arises when a bank lends money to the corporation at the same time that it acts as trustee for that corporation 's bondholders . Big corporations sometimes get into trouble ( Brooklyn-Manhattan was in receivership only a few years ago ) , and it is then important for the bondholders that no other creditors shall get paid first . Preferential payments leave less for the bondholders . Banks at times try to get their money as soon as they realize that a corporation which has borrowed from them is on its way to bankruptcy . It is the duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the trustee itself has lent money to the company , the trustee may not be able to withstand the temptation to take care of itself first . Mr. Aldrich , questioned on this general subject by the United States Senate Committee , recognized , as he put it , that a bank in this dual position is " in a difficult situation . Embarrassment does arise . " His bank brushed this embarrassment aside at the first opportunity . In the indenture framed by it and the BrooklynManhattan Corporation , the bank provided that it should have the right to do business with that company just as if the bank were not trustee for the bondholders at all .  |p715  Having taken care of itself in this and other ways , and having also protected the corporation 's directors and officers in the standard way , Chase Bank also made provision for its own officers , almost as in the time when Mr. Wiggin was head of the bank . During his administration a number of the bank 's officers had been allowed to make money on the side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sooner or later damage to investors had resulted from some of these ventures . Much evidence bearing on such incidents was taken by the United States Senate Committee last year . Mr. Aldrich did not like what the bank officers had done . He agreed with Senator Adams of Colorado when the latter said : " The evil comes from the fact that the judgment of the officer of the bank may be , entirely innocently perhaps , influenced by the fact that he has compensation coming from a borrower or customer of the bank , which might warp his judgment . " In the Brooklyn-Manhattan deal this June the Chase Bank did nothing to prevent such relationships . On the contrary , it expressly arranged that they should be permitted . The indenture reads that any officer of the bank in " his individual . . . capacity ... may engage in or be interested in any financial or other transactions with the Company . . . . " V The Chase Bank introduced into the indenture in this case another provision , one that is fairly common in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bondholder . Assume that a man who has bought one of the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit bonds learns about the immunities provided for directors and for the bank , and about the privileges accorded to it and to its officers in the indenture . He then knows that the trustee which is supposed to protect him has neglected one after another of the important safeguards shown by the testimony before the United States Senate Committee and by the misfortunes of many bondholders to be necessary for his protection . He knows that the bank in making rules ostensibly to protect him also made rules not in his interest . He knows that he was relying on a trustee that has insisted on the right to be blind to what it sees , to have its thinking done for it by a lawyer , and , so long as it does not become wilful and wilfully misconduct itself , to do anything or nothing , without obligation or responsibility to the bondholders it is supposed to protect . An investor who knows all this might conclude that he had better look after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what is going on in the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation , he would have to be ever watchful , he would have to be ready to conduct a fight for his rights if these should be invaded by the company . He might do this , if he had a large enough block of the bonds to justify such expense , or if he were so rich and so quixotic that he would expend large amounts out of all proportion to his investment . In short , he would have to be what the usual bondholder is not and can not be . Even so , this imaginary bondholder can not safely assume that he has the ordinary man 's right to protect his own interests . His situation is different from that of the ordinary creditor in the ordinary case . The bondholder must look at the indenture framed by Chase Bank and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation . It is a lengthy document that not one bondholder in a thousand is likely to see , and not one layman in a hundred thousand could read and understand . Does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the bondholder the right to protect himself ? One would suppose so . It is almost one hundred pages long , containing some thirty-five thousand words . Somewhere in this wealth of words there must be a word for the bondholder , just a phrase perhaps , saying he may protect himself if he wants to . Everybody else is remembered in this book . One whole chapter is devoted to Rights and Privileges of the Company . One chapter is devoted to Immunity of Stockholders , Officers , and Directors . One chapter is given over to the rights of the trustee , and other sections in other parts of the book are given over to the same subject . There must be something also for the bondholders , who are to put up all the money for this bond issue . On page 60 of the book there is the beginning of a new chapter . It has a hopeful title , Remedies of Trustee and Bondholders . It has nineteen sections , the largest number of any chapter in the book . The bondholder , having hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . First , he finds , there is a section mentioning certain rights that the bondholder does not have . Then follow many sections saying what the Chase Bank can do if it wants to , and what it must do if directed by owners of 25 per cent , 30 per cent , or 50 per cent of the bonds . So far it is the bank , not the bondholder , that can take action . At last the lawyer finds a section . He tells the bondholder that he can sue the company for the interest on his bond . He also tells his client that if he waits until the bond falls due in ordinary course , fifteen years from the present time , and his bond is not then paid by the company , he can sue to get payment . But the bondholder is still a bit worried . He wants to know about all the other obligations of the company , provided in the indenture , and shown by the sad and even disastrous experience of countless investors to be necessary for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its head above water just enough to pay interest , but is daily imperilling the principal of the bondholders ' investment , and is doing so in violation of its written promises . Can the ordinary bondholder do nothing ? Suppose , in addition , that the trustee , the Chase Bank , will not lift its hand for him . Can he lift his own hand to help himself ? His lawyer tells him that he can not , except subject to certain conditions that are ordinarily impossible for him . Before he can act he must go out and find a great many other bondholders , enough to constitute a holding of 25 per cent of all the bonds . His search , even if he could get a list of names and addresses , may lead him all over the United States . Having found them , he must tell them what is going on , and persuade them to join with him in asking the bank to act . But if he does no more than this , and the bank refuses to do anything , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He must also give the bank " security and indemnity , " so says the indenture . He must give the bank whatever amount it requires as " satisfactory to it , " and if the bank still refuses to move , then at last the bondholder can proceed to protect his own interests . All this the lawyer explains to the bondholder . And , if the lawyer has had any practical experience in these matters , he will add that the obstacles in the bondholder 's path are almost insuperable . VI The freedom from responsibility which big banks and corporate directors have double-riveted into these in/ dentures has been achieved with the acquiescence of some of the biggest men in financial America . Among these are the investment dealers or bankers who distribute bond issues . They have long claimed that they protect their customers , and they often have a considerable voice , greater even than that of the corporations issuing the bonds , in saying what shall be put into the indentures . Others among the financially elite who have acquiesced in the reissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are directors of banks who are influential in guiding their general policies . On the boards of some of the banks which drafted the indentures discussed here are leading bankers and the heads of some of the largest insurance companies . Financiers have risen in defense of such indentures , saying that they have been drafted in their present form in order to take care of possible contingencies in which they may be needed for the benefit of security holders . It is somewhat difficult to see how such thorough-going safeguards for corporation directors and bank-trustees could ever be used to protect investors . Financiers have also claimed that they never invoked any such indentures against security holders . Unfortunately , the record tells a different story . One of the many examples to be found in the public records may be mentioned . In the most recent big railroad reorganization , that of the St. Paul Railway , the Guaranty Trust Company of New York , second largest bank in the United States , was trustee for the bondholders . A committee , representing the owners of $18,000,000 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings . Guaranty Trust Company objected . The bondholders showed that the Trust Com- pany was under the control in that case of bankers who were trying to use the court proceedings for putting through a deal disliked by these bondholders . Nevertheless , Guaranty Trust Company claimed that under the indenture governing the rights of all the bondholders of the railway , the Trust Company alone could act for them as a party in the receivership proceedings , and that they could not do so themselves . The big bank was successful in invoking the language of the document , the objecting bondholders were defeated . Some men in the financial district feel , however , that all such past occurrences are no longer in point , that we are now in a reform era , and that no one is going to take advantage of the opportunities for irresponsibility provided in the indentures . Was it then only a taste for old furniture and old ways of doing things that betrayed the biggest banks and bankers into rummaging , in this reform era , among the debris of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which to indenture bondholders in the same old way ? Would it be overstepping the line of fairness to suggest that self-reform among bankers is not unlike their attitude toward the Securities Law of 1933 , while it was still being considered in Congress , and before it was passed by that body ? At that time , as one of the Senators publicly recalled when Mr. Aldrich presented his reform program to the Senate Banking Committee six months afterward , " we had telegrams and letters and speeches , all openly stating that they were in favor of the principles of the act , but apparently they were opposed to putting those principles into practice .
