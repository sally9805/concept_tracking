The sun , 864,000 miles in diameter , could contain a million bodies the size of the earth . Yet the sun , though of higher than average luminosity , is rather on the small side as stars go , being officially classed as a " yellow dwarf . " For a really big star astronomers look to Antares , a red supergiant 400,000,000 miles in diameter . All stars are globes of hot gas . Antares is relatively cool , its gaseous density very low . Thirty-seven thousand cubic feet of its star-stuff , if concentrated and brought to earth , would weigh only one pound . Yet up to last week it held rank as the largest star known to astronomy . <P> Last week Antares dropped to second place as news came out of University of Chicago 's Yerkes Observatory at Williams Bay , Wis. of a stellar monster four billion miles through the middle . If its centre were placed at the hub of the solar system it would engulf all the planets up to the last and most remote pair , Neptune and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of Yerkes , and two associates , the big star is an obscure companion of Epsilon Aurigae , a well-known star not far from Capella . Even more diffuse than Antares , it is believed to have a temperature of only 1,000 C. , lowest of any star known . Around the main body of the star is a shell of gas electrified by light from Epsilon Aurigae , in the same way that the electrified shell or " radio mirror " around earth is maintained by radiation from the sun . This phenomenon has never before been observed in a stellar atmosphere . Actually , Epsilon Aurigae 's monstrous , almost transparent companion has not yet been seen or photographed . It was deduced from spectrographic observations made on Epsilon Aurigae . Its size , constitution and temperature were determined after it passed in front of Epsilon Aurigae in 1929-30 , like a cloud in front of the moon . It took nine years for the Yerkes people to evolve a conclusion about this unique star which would fit the observed facts .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
