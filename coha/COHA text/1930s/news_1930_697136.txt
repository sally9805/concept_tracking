txt REPLY BY MR . GRAHAM . Congressman Denies Charges of Unfairness at Prohibition Hearings . To the Editor of The New York Times : In your issue of March 30 , under the caption of " Mrs. Boole Hits at Graham , " you printed an article which states that : " Mrs. Ella A. Boole , president of the National W. C. T. U.:at a prohibition rally held last night in connection with the Newark conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church , attacked Representative Graham of Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , for his manner of conducting the committee 's hearings on bills which would affect the prohibition laws . " Mrs. Boole intimated that the dry law sympathizers were not seated fairly before the committee , that dry law advocates were not properly notified of the dates set for the hearings and that the testimony of witnesses appearing as dry law advocates was cut short by the chairman . She also reported that she had heard a rumor that women received $2 a day to occupy seats in the committee room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribed to Mrs. Boole are individually and collectively false and untrue . The chairman had nothing to do with the seating of persons and he did not cut off the testimony of witnesses appearing as dry law advocates and the dry leaders have individually and collectively expressed to the chairman their appreciation of his fairness in conducting the investigation . The rumor which Mrs. Boole mentions is so grossly untrue that I am surprised that any one could have thought of such a thing and when the dry hearings came on there were scarcely any persons there who were for the wet side , and as to paying people to occupy seats in the committee room , thus barring dry sympathizers from seats , this is a highly false statement .

To the Editor of The New York Times : Have we a right to look for any radical reduction of armaments until the United States is ready to assume its full share of responsibility for the peace of the world ? Can France , in the light of her experi ence , afford to disarm ? Can England , with the responsibility for guarding her empire , the expansion of which has meant the setting up of a new order of society or system of law in backward regions , afford seriously to weaken her fleet under present conditions ? The five-power treaty , visaging avoidance of war in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' treaty for consultation in the event of trouble in the Mediterranean would have Its uses too ; and , lacking something better , the United States ought possibly to enter into a Mediterranean pact . But , there ip something better ? namely , a universal pact . Universality  --  all acting for each  --  is the thing desired . Out of the united action of the whole world justice is certain to emerge , and with justice , peace . By and large , it is the only safe principle . Just as , within the State , conflict of group interests makes for progress and for justice , so in the society of nations the balancing of national interests and also of regional interests makes for sanity and justice . Two things are needed before we can look for any wholesale reduction or armaments ; actual disarmament , I take it , is a chimera . The first consideration is that the League of Nations can never be what it was intended to be  --  namely , a guarantee of peace  --  until it is strengthened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world in potential strength and prestige . With us in the League , and with the covenant perfected by the adoption of an actual procedure for combined action against the aggressor  --  such procedure , for example , as was embodied in the Geneva protocol of 1924  --  the League of Nations would come into its own . , The second item is the element of time . Before the great powers can be expected to impair their defensive strength , the League must have shown that it is able to do what it professes to do  --  namely , protect its members in emergencies . We may witness the lapse of a full generation before there arises sufficient confidence in the purposes and power of the b Lear , ue to bring to Europe that sense of security which alone makes possible the serious impairment of defensive strength .

To the Editor of The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed statements to the effect that it is time , among the cultures that in this land continuously fuse to form the American spirit , for the launching of a liberal college of arts and science under Jewish auspices . The sense of this need rises , not from any real or fancied prejudice against Jews in existing colleges , but from a feeling that there is much in the knowledge and culture of Judaism that is worth preserving in the American personality ; that the people of the Bible have still a contribution to humanity to make . The appearance of such a call for a Jewish college indicates the timeliness  --  but unfortunately a certain public ignorance  --  of the Yeshiva College , the first college of liberal arts and science under Jewish auspices , and now completing the second year of its collegiate work . The Yeshiva College , located at 186th Street and Amsterdam Avenue , New York City , is a department of the Yeshiva ( the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary ) , one of the oldest centres of Hebrew learning in America and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent of the age-old homes of intensive Jewish knowledge and research , the Yeshivoth . The aims of the Yeshiva College , which is authorized by the University of the State of New York to give courses leading to the baccalaureate degrees , are to afford a harmonious union of culture and spirituality , to bring into the wide field of American education the contribution of the spiritual values of Judaism , of the Jewish ideals of disinterested education , of the Jewish perspective upon learning and knowledge . It is , and expects to remain , a small college , being intended primarily for Jewish youth who consider Jewish learning part of the mental and moral equipment they wish to obtain through a college education ; Jewish studies are pursued by all who are here taking the general college course in the humanities . The quality of the students at the Yeshiva College is for the present insured by the fact that they are mainly drawn from the best among the graduates of the Yeshiva high school , which , during the decade for which it has sent forth graduating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State on Regents ' examinations , and in State scholarships won . Indeed , the Yeshiva high school ( the Talmudical Academy ) has consistently headed the list of large private and parochial schools in New York State . The college entrance scholastic aptitude tests , given to the entering freshman classes of the Yeshiva College by an outside expert , have yielded results approximating those of the colleges of the highest standing throughout the land . On its inception the Yeshiva College was hailed by prominent persons interested in the American character , and by educators of standing in this country and abroad , who felt the validity of all efforts to effect greater harmony between intellectualism and spirituality , to combine culture and faith . Among the members of the advisory Yeshiva College Council , to help in the realization of this ideal , are . Frederick B. Robinson , president of the College of the City of New York ; Charles C. Torrey , Professor Department of Semitics , Yale University ; David Eugene Smith , professor emeritus Columbia University ; Nathan Isaacs , professor , Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April I , tail ) . -
