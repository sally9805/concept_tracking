Famed chiefly for talking , the Rightist " Radio General " Queipo de Llano and his men achieved the only significant military action in Spain last week , finally wrested from the Leftists 150 square miles in the Penarroya sector which has been warmly contested for the past three months , chiefly because they contain deposits of lead , copper , iron and coal . Biggest is a French-owned coal mine and this week , with the Leftists repulsed to a distance of twelve miles , miners resumed work and General Queipo de Llano radiorated louder than ever . Meanwhile , the widely advertised Aragon-Teruel offensive along the northeastern battle line from the French frontier to a point a little north of Valencia , over which both Rightists and Leftists were violently shadow-boxing fortnight ago ( TIME , Nov. 1 ) , was postponed for at least ten days because of an act of God . Unexpected rains in the high Pyrenees flooded the Gllego and Ebro Rivers 20 ft. above normal , flooded trenches on both sides for several miles to their rear , turned the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting continued in the Madrid suburbs . <P> Meanwhile , for the first time in modern history , a Spanish Government moved to Barcelona , the second move of the Leftist Government since the war started . Plenty of government bureaus remained in overcrowded Valencia . Signaling the move , Minister of the Interior Julian Zugazagoita made a radio speech containing two statements , neither of which would have been possible year ago when the Leftist Government first moved to Valencia : <P> " The Government planned to go to Barcelona as early as last November but decided temporarily on Valencia . . . . Barcelona now in its turn has the significance of showing the clear fidelity of the Government toward Catalonia . <P> " The Government is not obliged to appeal for obedience , but has the right to impose it . ... We have come to agree with the sage formula of that exceptional captain of Christ , Saint Ignatius de Loyola , who imposed on his disciples silent obedience ' until death . ' The task must be accomplished . We must win by our own strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madrid Government dared not move to the then anarchist-ridden Catalan Barcelona , or words of praise for the founder of the powerful , much-feared Jesuit order , would have been tantamount to treason . <P> On the sea thus far there has been little decisive action in the Spanish war , but Rightist Generalissimo Francisco Franco , without waiting to be granted the right to blockade , one of the " belligerent rights " now being hashed over in London ( see col. 1 ) , was reported last week planning to establish a naval blockade of the Leftist coast , appointed Vice Admiral Francisco Moreno Fernndez to be Commander in Chief of Rightist naval forces in Majorca . This made correspondents unquenchably curious to visit the island of Majorca , often rumored to be in Italian hands .
