The Week WE HAVE no desire , Heaven knows , to make anyone needlessly gloomy at this season of holiday cheer ; and we suggest that any reader who feels that things are just fine and dandy should skip this paragraph . For ourselves , we must admit that as we survey the state of affairs , we should n't be at all surprised if Santa Claus , after a similar tirvey , were to turn around , go back to the North ? le , lock himself into his workshop and indulge in a good cry . For who can be merry in a world like this ? Geneva estimates that there are 35,000,000 people out of work in the industrialized countries , of . whom at least a third are in the United States in Many of these , in several countries , and the United States most of all , are in actual danger of starving and some have starved already . The end of the depression has been predicted over and over but a study of the available indices of business reveals no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average are only a little more than half of what they were during most of the decade before 1929 . The international outlook is as discouraging as is the domestic one . The bungling of the war-debt issue , on both sides of the ocean , has fomented more bitter feeling than has existed at any time since the close of the War . American officials are being guarded by police as they ride through the streets of Paris ; fantastic proposals for punishing the defaulting debtors are heard in the halls of our Congress . Meanwhile , the danger of armed conflict in various parts of the world continues to be serious . There is an undeclared war actually going on in the Gran Chaco , in South America ; there is another one in Manchuria , and the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia has frightened and angered the Japanese until the inauguration of hostilities on a much greater scale is entirely within the bounds of possibility . In western Europe , the German-Polish situation is made more critical by the character of the present German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only man who can say " Merry Christmas I " wholeheartedly is one who has spent the last few years in bed with the covers pulled over him . THE Senate last week passed a bill for Philippine independence . Since the House adopted a similar measure some months ago , the two bills will now go to conference , and the final form of the proposal is expected to come up to President Hoover for action before the end of this session . That he will veto the bill is considered certain ; and there is no doubt that he ought to do so . The New Republic has consistently supported Philippine independence for many years , and still does ; but the bill which passed the Senate is so bad that it is hard to believe anything could be done to it in conference to make it acceptable . It suggests a twelve-year period before independence becomes effective , but it would limit Philippine trade with the United States , and curtail immigration , long before the end of that time . The plebiscite which the original Hawes-Cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has disappeared ; the Filipinos would vote almost at once upon a proposed Constitution , and would doubtless swallow that Constitution , no matter how bad it might be , for fear a rejection of it would lose them their chance of freedom . The restrictions upon their trade with us would mean strangu. lation for the archipelago 's economic life , which would not be the case if tariffs were increased little by little over a long term of years . Everyone knows that the action of Congress is not based on morality , or justice , or the promise made in the Jones Act ; it is based upon the objection of American producers to the competition of Philippine sugar , hemp and other products which now come in duty-free . But there is no reason why their selfishness should take the form of national swinishness . FOR the last few months , the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has had three main jobs , under its charter from Congress . One of these has been to put one and a half billion dollars into circulation as quickly as possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend up to three hundred millions to the states for relief work . Another has been to continue its loans to banks , railroads , insurance companies and other institutions to stave off bankruptcy . What the R.F.C. has done has been to continue wholeheartedly the third of these duties ? so wholeheartedly that if its operations are made the subject of a senatorial investigation , as they probably will be , the revelations will startle the country . In regard to the first two tasks imposed by Congress , however , the R.F.C. has engaged in a deliberate policy of sabotage . It has loaned for public works less than a tenth of the funds at its disposal ; it has set impossibly high interest rates ; it has made all sorts of pettifogging objections to plans brought before it . Similarly , it has loaned to the states far less than has been asked , and has haggled interminably over bookkeeping methods and other matters . Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York was well justified , therefore , in pleading this week for liberalization of the R.F.C. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked that the fund available for loans to the states be increased beyond the present $300,000,000 , on the ground that much more will be needed . He asked a special fund of $10 , - 000,000 to use in rehabilitating several hundred thousand homeless boys , and even some girls , who are now drifting around the country , victims of the depression . He would modify the provision for " self-liquidating " projects , which practically requires that borrowers have the power of prophecy , and would let states and cities borrow for enterprises which are " necessary and economically sound " ? which should certainly be all that is required . He would speed up the work of the R.F.C. by putting relief funds into the hands of a special committee of three competent persons , instead of the entire personnel of the corporation 's board as at present . He would reduce the present ridiculously high interest rate on loans for public works , until it is one-half of one percent higher than the rate paid by the federal government for its most recent long-term bonds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt them . Mr. Hoover , of course ; is the inspiration of the R.F.C. 's tactics of sabotage ; but even he would hesitate a long time before he would veto such a bill , in the country 's present plight . IN A communication which appears in this issue of The New Republic , Mr. Smith Simpson suggests that Governor Roosevelt might profitably use the time before he is inaugurated as President in a visit to Europe , during which he could be informed at first hand about the many international problems with which he has to deal . The advan- , tages of such a procedure are set forth skillfully , by Mr. Simpson and we shall not repeat them here . Everything , of course , is comparative ; and Mr. Roosevelt in considering this suggestion will have to weigh it in the balance against the use he might make of the same time here at home . If he were to devote it to seeing a great crowd of political callers , 95 percent of whom would be looking for jobs for themselves or their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and the country . On the other hand it must be remembered that Mr. Roosevelt is being pitchforked into the field of national and international affairs with which he has had little to do for the past twelve years . He has to shape his policy in regard to a whole series of desperately urgent problems , both at home and abroad . He needs to absorb , probably , as much information as the average college student acquires in a four-year course ; he has to be sure that it is correct and , most important of all , he must make up his mind what action he will take on a basis of this information . More than anything else , he needs to lock himself up alone and think . If he will only do so , he can get more enlightenment out of staying at home than he possibly could out of a hectic holiday abroad where his every footstep would be dogged by expert special pleaders of special causes . EARLY in December , Mr. S. L. Rothafel ? RoxY to you ? flatly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Inter- national Music Hall , of which he is lessee . The three statues , executed by Robert Laurent , Gwen Lux and William Zorach , had been approved by a special committee serving under the architects of Radio City , by the designer of the interiors and by the representatives of John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , the owner . In spite of protests from all these , and from several art organizations as well , Roxy re " fused to reinstate the statues . He has tried to justify his stand by a series of newspaper statements indicating ( a ) that he rejected the three pieces because they are nudes , ( b ) that he did not reject them because they are nudes , but because they are " modern , " and ( c ) that he really rejected them because they are unpleasant and have a negative esthetic effect on him . He declares that ' although he is not an art critic , he represents his public ; his choice is theirs . But can Roxy be so sure of his box-office judgment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those who dominate the theatrical and motion-picture industries have either underestimated or mistaken the needs of the public . Purple passion and no ideas , dramas without drama , theatres without taste , vaudeville without freshness , films cut and stitched after the Prince Charming pattern -- all these have been leading producers and managers and lessees toward the welcoming hands of the receivers . Meanwhile there are examples to show that good shows and films dealing with subjects that people care about can still draw capacity houses . The International Music Hall has six thousand seats to fill . If this great entertainment venture lags behind the public , a lot of them will be empty . IN LAST week 's New Republic we commented on the motion picture , " I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , " which was based on the experiences of R. E. Burns . This man , whose story is told in his book , " I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang " ( Vanguard ) , was a war veteran , drifting around the United States from place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense . Given a long sentence to the chain gang , he escaped , made his way to Chicago , and there became a respected business man with a large income . Betrayed by a jealous woman , he waived extradition and returned to Georgia on the promise that he Would receive only nominal punishment . Georgia broke its word , so he escaped again , and once more made his way north . While in hiding he wrote his book , and aided in turning it into a brilliant motion Picture , one of the finest of the past year . Now he has been arrested again , in New Jersey , where he had recently been making open , public appearances under his own name . Georgia is trying to get him hack once more , with the grim implication that he Will be caused to suffer amply for having made something of a laughing stock of the state 's penal system . Governor A. Harry Moore of New Jersey is being flooded with letters asking him not to rant extradition , and there is some evidence that ne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornPlicated by the fact w that New York police claim 13nrils is anted in that state on an old charge of forgery , an accusation which he denies . ) Needless to say , the Governor of Georgia is overlooking the chance of a lifetime to make a fine stroke for himself and his state . If he would publicly announce that the object of imprisonment being reform , and Burns having obviously reformed , the state has no desireto cause him senseless suffering and sets him South he would do much to rehabilitate the Deep 2outh in the eyes of public opinion , shocked by the beottsboro case and other events of recent years . WHILE we hope Burns does not have to go back to the chain gang , we regret the fact that public attention has so centered upon his special case , and has so largely ignored the system of which he is only one victim . The chain gang as it exists in Georgia and other states is a survival of barbarism . Hundreds of other men who in the true sense are no more guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving today outrageous sentences , subjected to deliberate torture and sometimes paying with their lives for the slightest attempt to assert theinselves . Particularly hard is the lot of Negroes who , as our readers know , are often picked up when entirely innocent , sentenced on a fictitious charge and given their choice of serving on the chain gang or being forced to work out the amount of a fine which has been paid for them by some plantation owner . The issue of the Burns case is a thousand times less important than the evil itself ; yet human nature is such that for every person who can be persuaded to think about these conditions in general , there will be a thousand to applaud or oppose Burns 's fight for freedom , and forget the whole matter as soon as that fight is decided . ONE of the signs of a period of turbulence and change is the appearance of numerous new periodicals , devoted to the ideas of an individual or a group . These non-commercial or semi-commercial magazines do not usually last very long ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brevity of their careers . Two recent arrivals in the American publishing field , for which we hope a longer life than has been granted to so many of their predecessors , are Americana and Common Sense . Americana , after appearing several times as a monthly magazine of satirical drawings , has now launched forth into savagely satirical prose and verse as well , much of which is of excellent quality . Common Sense is a new fortnightly , of which the guiding spirit is Alfred Bingham , son of Senator Hiram Bingham of Connecticut , but very far from sharing his father 's orthodox Republican views . Common Sense is an endeavor to popularize the doctrine that this country needs a drastic redistribution of wealth and opportunity ; and if it can survive the fatal first few months when the mortality among newborn magazines is so high , it promises to aid effectively in a job which greatly needs to be done . THE Saturday Evening Post , which is the leading spokesman for self-destructive nationalism , has inaugurated a " Buy American " campaign , in imitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign in an article by Samuel G. Blythe , which is almost a world 's record for bad thinking and economic misinformation . It is the quaint notion of Mr. Blythe and The Saturday Evening Post that foreign trade consists exclusively of foreigners sending goods here and taking our money away , as its cartoons show us , in bales . This process causes cobwebs to grow across the doors of the American factories which would otherwise have produced these goods . Have these gentlemen any suggestion as to how foreigners shall pay for the goods they buy , or could buy , from us ? Do they know that in 1929 foreigners bought 55 percent of our year 's output of cotton , 41 percent of our tobacco , 33 percent of our lard , 18 percent of our wheat , 36 percent of our copper , 35 percent of our kerosene , 31 percent of our lubricating oils , 40 percent of our typewriters , 29 percent of our printing machinery , 28 percent of our sewing machines , 23 percent of our agricultural machinery , 21 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there is a disadvantage in mutual buying and selling , we respectfully suggest that The Post put up an insurmountable tariff wall about Independence Square , Philadelphia . Then it could buy at home to its heart 's content , and we should never have to see it again .
