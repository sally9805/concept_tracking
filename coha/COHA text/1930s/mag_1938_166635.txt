Sirs : <P> Again TIME errs ! All of Zola 's works are not on the famed Catholic Index of Prohibited Books . A friend of Zola 's challenged him to write one book that would not be banned . Zola 's The Dream can be read by Catholics-TIME 'S statement notwithstanding . <P> <P> EDWARD J. GULANICK <P> St. Procopius College <P> Lisle , Ill . <P> <P> Many authorities believe that Emile Zola wrote The Dream because he wanted very much to get into the French Academy . It is almost aggressively innocuous , but beside Emile Zola 's name in the Catholic Index librorum prohibitorum are the words opera omnia , all his works including his snowdrop among weeds , " The Dream . - ED . <P> <P> From Slot Machines <P> Sirs : <P> Shame on you for the use of such terms as " few people ever expected " and " for that surprising purpose " in connection with Wichita 's peddling of insurance through slot machines ! TIME , Jan. 24 . <P> In 1910 you could have procured a similar accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dime in a machine issued by the long since defunct International Vending Machine Co . Every station of Hudson &; Manhattan Railroad Co. was decorated with three or four of these machines . . . . <P> <P> DAVID V. MCCAULEY , S.J. Dean <P> School of Medicine <P> Georgetown University <P> Washington , D. C. <P> <P> No Shenanigans <P> Sirs : <P> You made an inaccurate and erroneous statement in your issue of Dec. 27 . ... You said : " That the finance companies were not entirely innocent of shenanigans appeared , however , with the revelation that they had hired a onetime newshawk named Harry G. Croy to investigate the personnel of the grand jury . " <P> The finance companies did not hire Mr. Croy . I , as counsel for Commercial Credit Co. , appeared before Judge Geiger in the proceedings to which you refer . The record of those proceedings clearly shows that Commercial Credit Co. had nothing whatever to do with the employment of Mr. Croy . Neither it nor any of its representatives knew anything about the matter . Counsel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment of Mr. Croy , and he stated to the Court that he had not consulted with any other company when he employed Mr. Croy . . . . <P> <P> DUANE R. DILLS <P> New York , N. Y. <P> <P> TIME , in company with newspapers reporting the trial , erred . Newshawk Croy was hired by Phillip W. Haberman , attorney for Universal Credit , who says he wanted to find out why accounts of the supposedly secret Grand Jury proceedings were getting to the press . But all the finance companies , Commercial Credit included , would have benefited if Newshawk Croy had found out anything. - ED . <P> <P> Inconsistent Communists <P> Sirs : <P> ... It may interest your readers to hear that the Chinese Communists ( TIME , Jan. 10 ) , who as we know profess not to believe in Christ , issued paper currency and minted coins in Kiangsi dated according to the Christian calendar , thus themselves officially testifying to Christ 's advent . <P> <P> C.
