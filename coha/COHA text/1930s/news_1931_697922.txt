txt As the Federal Government concentrated its forces here yesterday to accumulate evidence against racketeers who have paid no income tax on their earnings from the sale of narcotics and liquor , one of the leading beer-runners of the city , Arthur ( Dutch ) Schultz , was virtually delivered into their hands . Schultz was in the West Side jail last night under $150,000 bail on three criminal charges and Dan Iamascia , one of his lieutenants , captured with him in front of 1,212 Fifth Avenue at 2 o'clock yesterday morning , lay dead in Mount Sinai Hospital . Two detectives , who caught Schultz , wounded Iamascia and put three other gangsters to flight in a pistol battle in Fifth Avenue , found $18,645 in the gang leader 's pockets when they searched , him for weapons . Police Inspector John A. Lyons immediately informed George Z. Medalie , United States Attorney , of this find and it is expected that Mr. Medalie and Mr. Lyons will confer in a day or two on plans for cooperating toward the end that Schultz may be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal counts . There were some in the Federal Building , however , who held that the money found on Schultz was probably income for 1931 , which is not yet taxable . Tax Returns Flowing In . Al Capone 's conviction in Chicago for tax evasion and violation of the prohibition law , and the news that the men who pinned the charges on him are now on the trail of others of his kind in New York , has resulted in a flood of belated returns , it was learned yesterday in the Federal Building . Repentant racketeers who hope to escape the penalty for tax evasion in this manner are mistaken , however , if they think this will save them from prosecution . Filing of returns with whatever explanation for tardiness will not exempt them , the officials said . A co-ordinator , trained in regulating the operations of various branches of the Federal service so that they work as a single unit in the quest for evidence against taxevading gang leaders and racketeers , is coming from Washington to work in the drive . William J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welded the ' Federal units in Chicago , is not available for the work in New York because the drive against the gangsters in the mid-Western city is far from ended , and more indictments are expected there . Attorney General Mitchell said in Washington last night that complete rout of the gangsters and their organizations can be effected only through cooperation between the Federal , State and city agencies . The mass of evidence dug up in the income-tax cases includes leads that may end in convictions for . crimes over which the State or the municipality has jurisdiction , he pointed out . The Federal investigation here is much broader in scope than the inquiry in Chicago . The opportunity for the racket in this city covers a much wider range because of the enormous wealth in the city . The Federal men are not only going after the beer runners , narcotic peddlers and rum dealers , but after the kosher chicken trust , the laundries , markets , slot-machine operators and night-club owners , it was revealed . Busy Day for Schultz . Schultz had a busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East 104th Street Precinct for questioning about the four-room apartment that he maintained on the ninth floor of 1,212 Fifth Avenue , opposite the park at 102d Street . He rented the place for $2,500 a year , according to the police . The owners knew him as Russel Jones and the hallboys knew him as a " swell tipper . " The police say he used the establishment as his headquarters , positive that they would never look for his hide-out in such a pretentious dwelling . Schultz was nervous and trembling after the capture , according to the detectives , and required a bromide before his nerves steadied . This they attributed to his mistaken belief that when the policemen swooped down on him and his confederates he was being " put on the spot . " By the time he reached the line-up in Police Headquarters his nervousness had disappeared . Chief Inspector John Sullivan questioned him in vain . He gave evasive answers to all questions , denied he knew Iamascia or that he had thrown away a pistol when the police closed in ; insisted he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window sills in his apartment and refused to tell where he got the $18,645 found in his pockets . Lauds Detectives for Capture . Inspector Sullivan , turning from the prisoner remarked to the detectives around him : " It 's a sad commentary on the efficiency of the detectives of the upper part of this city that this bum was allowed to roam around for so long with this gun , " and warmly commended Detectives Stephen Di Rose and Julius Salgen of the headquarters squad , who had made the arrest . From headquarters Schultz was taken to the District Attorney 's office , where he was questioned by Assistant District Attorney Saul Price . Here , again , he gave answers that were no help to the authorities . Then he was hustled to Harlem Court for arraignment before Magistrate Anthony Burke on three charges , one of attempted felonious assault ( drawing a pistol on Salgen ) and two for violation of the Sullivan law . By the time he reached the court house he had an attorney , Gilbert S. Rosenthal , who strenuously op posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining that Schultz was not the bad man newspapers represented him to be . The detectives , on the other hand , said he was " one of the leading gunmen in this city , " so the bail stood . Last night Rosenthal was preparing habeas corpus action and hoped to have his client in Supreme Court this morning for reduction of the bond . Before the prison van came at 6:30 P. M. to take him from the Harlem cell to West Side prison Schultz displayed his generosity by purchasing dinner for all the other prisoners . On the ride to the jail the prison van was flanked by motorcycle policemen , apparently to meet any possible attempt by the Schultz gang to obtain the release of their leader . Figured in Vitale Dinner . Iamascia , who was one of the three men alleged to have retrieved the jewelry and a policeman 's pistol taken from the guests at the famous Magistrate Vitale dinner by fellow-gunmen who staged the fake hold-up , was bhot in the abdomen by Detective DI Rosa when he tried to shoot his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died last night . The police said they found two pistols in his possession . The detectives seemed certain , despite the silence maintained by Schultz and Iamascia , that the $18 , - 000 in $100 and $500 banknotes carried by the gang leader was intended for the gang pay-off in the Schultz apartment . How they got the tip or what led them to 1,212 Fifth Avenue was not disclosed . They got nothing in the apartment except the automatics , two pairs of binoculars apparently used to sight enemies approaching the house by automobile , and a woman 's dress . Schultz , whose real name is Arthur Flegenheimer , has been arrested nine times in the past twelve years for everything from disorderly conduct to homicide , but there is only one conviction on his record . On his first arrest , for unlawful entry , he drew a penitentiary sentence from Judge Mulqueen , in January , 1919 . He is now 34 years old , and gave his occupation yesterday as " roofer . " " It 's a good , long time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schultz merely shrugged his shoulders and smiled faintly . With the capture of Schultz the police hope to go a long way toward breaking up the beer-runner 's war that has cost many lives in the Bronx and upper Manhattan within the past year . Iamascla 's death may also be a help , they admit . As the police figure it out , Schultz has " tied up " with Ciro Terranova , " artichoke king , " and others associated with him in the policy racket . In affecting this alliance he discarded all his former associates who had protected his beer caravans until a few months ago and it is they who are at war with him . They seek to wrest from him not only control of the beer distribution but also of the policy racket and the sale of alcohol in Harlem and the Bronx . Led , according to the policey P Vincent Coll , whose brother , Pete , was slain on Decoration Day at St. Nicholas Avenue and 111th Street by Schultz 's new adherents , the gang has accounted for at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa , John Jacapraro , Carmine Barelli and Joe ( the Baker ) Catania . Iamascai , incidentally , was picked up as a material witness in the shooting of Joe the Baker , but gave the police no information . He was still out under bond on this case when he was shot yesterday by Detective Di Rosa .
