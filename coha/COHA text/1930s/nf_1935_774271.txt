Most . of the contract applications were obtained at community meetings , but in the major corn-hog producing areas local committeemen were instructed to make a farm-to-farm canvass of all eligible producers who had not signed applications for the purpose of obtaining either an application or a record of the nonsigner 's base period production of corn and hogs . Because of the expense of a canvass of this kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , and in some of these it was by no means complete . Nearly 1.2 million contract applications were obtained between January and May 1934 . The time expended in securing them was unexpectedly long for several reasons : ( 1 ) the large amount of work devolving on the county agent and committeemen in actually filling in the contracts , ( 2 ) the time required for tenants to " check in " with non-resident landlords , at least one of whom was located in China , ( 3 ) the time needed to obtain " adequate " records of hog production , and ( 4 ) the time involved in referring the enormous volume of questions and problems to , and getting answers , interpretations , or new administrative rulings from , federal and state headquarters . ' Footnote  | COUNTY CONTROL ASSOCIATIONS The next step in carrying the plan into effect was to organize the county corn-hog control associations . Each community in the county held a meeting to elect the " permanent " community committeemen , usually three in each community . The chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The county directors then met to perfect the county organization , adopt the articles of association prescribed by the Corn-Hog Section , elect officers , appoint the county allotment committee ( usually composed of the president of the association and from two to four directors ) , determine upon a budget and upon the method of making public corn-hog applicants ' production data , and elect a secretary and treasurer . ' The great majority of the elections were conducted in a fair and impartial manner . Occasionally a farm organization or some local faction attempted to control one , usually with little or no success . Most of the committeemen elected were men of character and ability , though in many cases not men who had previously been considered leaders in the community . Unavoidably , an occasional incompetent or partial group of men would be elected to the board of directors and the county allotment committee . Nearly every state had one or two examples of boards of directors who were unequal to the task of conducting their duties in a fair and impartial manner or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " chisel " and to permit their friends and cronies to do likewise . It is only fair to state that cases of this kind were distinctly in the minority and , on the Footnote  | whole , directors performed their duties in a manner to which little exception could be taken . Not the least important result of this campaign was the development of latent farm leadership ; the way these men shouldered their responsibilities and grew into their jobs can not be over-emphasized . However , not infrequently the efficient conduct of an association was mostly due not to the board of directors but to the county agent or even someone with little or no authority , such as a tabulator , a clerk , or a stenographer . The first task of the permanent organization was to appraise the corn yield of the fields that applicants were offering to rent to the Secretary . The community committee visited every field so offered and estimated the yield to be expected in 1934 under ten-year ( 1924-33 ) average growing conditions . Concurrently , the board of directors and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical and factual errors . Mechanical errors included those of arithmetic and proper application of rulings , omitted data , improper signatures , and a long list of others that were discovered by careful checking of the contract and associated documents . A great majority of the contracts and supporting forms were found to contain mechanical errors of some kind . In many cases they were of a type necessitating contacting the producers again . This was an expensive and time consuming process . Factual errors included misstatements , both intentional and unintentional , in the basic data upon which the contract rested ? specifically acres and production in the case of corn and other crops , and litters , production for market , and feeder pig purchases in the case of hogs . The attitude and ability of those in charge of the contract application meetings affected  | greatly both the amount and character of these errors . The major task of the county allotment committee was to reconcile the base period production of corn and hogs as reported on the applications with the quotas established for them . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract applications . OVERSTATEMENT The Corn-Hog Section was convinced that the contract applications of producers would overstate the base period production of contract applicants . If this overstatement were not removed , it would tend to defeat the immediate objective of the program ? to reduce production ? and would penalize producers who had reported accurately . Some of the overstatement , it was realized , would be unintentional . Most people have an unconscious memory bias , and farmers are no exception . ' Since many farmers had no record of their farm business , much less an adequate one , this bias was accentuated by the direct monetary advantage that accrued from reporting the highest figure of a range within which the truth might actually lie . An additional factor expected to lead to acreage overstatement was that most farmers make no allowance for roads , fences , turn-rows , small gullies , and other waste land . Most farmers , however , knew at least roughly the size of their farms , and of the fields that they planted to corn in 1932 and 1933 . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no similar check was available for deter-Footnote  | mining the litters farrowed and the hogs raised for market even in 1933 . The reported base period production of hogs consequently was expected to be subject to the greater error . Besides the unintentional overstatement , it was expected that there would be some which was intentional . In both cases it was necessary to lay plans for measuring the amount of overstatement and removing it ? The problem of determining the amount of overstatement would have been relatively simple if an actual record of the base period production of corn and hogs by states and counties had been available and if all or almost all producers had made application for a cornhog contract . But the state estimates of the Department of Agriculture , ' particularly of hog production , were felt to be less adequate and accurate than was desirable , while those for minor civil divisions ( except those for corn yields ) were felt to be subject to a wide margin of error . It was a foregone conclusion , moreover , that the participation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be far from complete . Consequently , unusually elaborate plans were laid to tap all possible sources of information , including the contracts themselves , in determining state and county Footnote  | corn-hog quotas . ' This task was delegated almost entirely to the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics through its central office in Washington and its branch offices in the 48 states . Most check data came directly or indirectly from three sources : ( 1 ) Department of Agriculture surveys of acreages , yields , hog litters , hogs saved , and hogs raised ; ' ? ( 2 ) state census or tax assessment figures ; and ( 3 ) the 1930 United States census . The compilation and summarization of material from these sources both in Washington and in the state offices of the division was done late in 1933 and in the early part of 1934 . In each state , the Corn-Hog Section appointed a board of review of three or four , of which the state representative of the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistician was appointed for every crop reporting district ( typically nine to the state ) in the major producing areas and one or two in each state in secondary producing areas . To expedite the summarizing of producers ' claims so that they could be examined by the state board of review for overstatement , tabulators were appointed in each major county . As soon as possible after contract applications had been received at the local county offices , these tabulators transferred pertinent data to listing sheets Footnote  | and forwarded them to the state board of review . When all the data submitted to the board of review were finally summarized , the hog production claimed by applicants alone frequently exceeded the preliminary estimate of all hog production for the state , and the base acreage of corn appeared too high , though it was not " inflated " nearly so much . The methods used in determining the amount of the overstatement and in setting county contract quotas varied widely . At the one extreme was the method used in the major producing states ? the determination of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state . At the other extreme was the method used in the least important states ? a county contract quota based solely upon an inspection of the individual contracts ( and supporting evidence ) . In between were various combinations of both methods . In some states , quotas for a number of counties were determined by one method and for the remainder by the other ; in others , one method was used to determine the hog quota and the other to determine the corn quota . In still other states , both methods were used . ' Regardless of the way the quotas were established , the relation they bore to the actual though unknown production of applicants in all probability varied appreciably . In the majority of cases the quota probably equalled or exceeded the actual base period production ; in some counties , however , it seems to have been somewhat below . These cases seem to have occurred most frequently when the " state quota " method was used . It is , of course , impossible to determine exactly what the relation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that some counties had less difficulty than others in reaching their quotas , that some counties never did reach them , and that other counties got below them does not necessarily give any indication of the amount of " error " in them . The amount of overstatement in the applications of producers as indicated by the county quotas varied widely both as between counties and as between the hog production and the corn production claims . For the United States as a whole , the hogs produced for market claimed by contract applicants averaged nearly 12 per cent above the quotas . But in some counties less than i o per cent ' overstatement was indicated , while in others the percentage indicated was over i oo per cent . The overstatement in 1932-33 corn acreage of contract applicants was only about 3.6 per cent , and few counties had an indicated overstatement of more than 15 per cent . The original corn yield appraisals on contracted acres ranged from s to i per cent above the 1924-33 average in the major producing states . In minor corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten-year average , but there seems to be good reason for believing that in many of these states the contracted acres were above the state average in productivity . When the county quotas were released by state boards of review during May and June 1934 , a storm of protest arose from farmers and committeemen . They contended that no such " padding , " intended or otherwise , existed in the claims of applicants . ' Most county allot- Footnote  | ment committees ' first reaction was to demand an upward revision of their quotas ; not a few of them , indeed , thought for a while that the quotas released were the first step in a " horse-trading " deal . When this proved incorrect , some of the more recalcitrant committees took it upon themselves to organize " protest " meetings to which were invited allotment committees from surrounding counties . Frequent appeals were made to congressmen asking them to use their influence to obtain concessions from the AAA , and on June 21 , 1934 , at the height of the controversy , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county quotas . " 3 State extension supervisors , the Corn-Hog Section , and the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates came in for a share of the blame.14 In fact , the state supervisors and junior statisticians frequently bore the brunt of the initial attack as they travelled from county to county in the field . Many of the extension supervisors , though by no means all , were inclined to side with the producer in the controversy . In the first place , they feared that to do otherwise might jeopardize the regular extension program ; and secondly , they were unfamiliar with the statistical procedure involved and were somewhat skeptical of it . County agents were naturally Footnote  | even more prone to support the producers ' claims . Moreover , extension workers and county agents were both closely associated with farmers and remote from Washington , and were consequently likely to see things through the eyes of producers . Indeed , state corn-hog committees , corn-hog field men , and the farmer and extension service members of the state boards of review themselves by no means solidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents were perhaps d ' . e in part to the negligible number of cases of overstatement that had come to light as a result of publishing the claims of contract applicants . In an attempt to prevent and detect overstatement , all cornhog control associations were required by the AAA to publish in local newspapers data showing the corn and hog production claimed by contract applicants . This was done shortly after all , or almost all , applications were completed . Relatively few cases of overstatement were reported in spite of the large amount present , particularly in producers ' claims of hogs raised and marketed.15 The failure of this publicizing of claims to uncover overstatement must be laid largely to farmers ' lack of specific knowledge concerning the past scale of operations of their neighbors . Since most farmers had considerable difficulty remembering how many acres of corn and how many hogs they themselves had raised in 1932 and 1933 , it seems obvious that they had still more difficulty in remembering what their neighbors had done . For this reason little significance can be attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from farmers because they felt it was unethical Footnote  | to " carry tales.j16 Most control associations , incidentally , felt that the expense of publishing this material was too high and that attempts to get , special rates tended to antagonize the local press which , on the whole , had supported the corn-hog program and had given it considerable free publicity . After they had recovered from the initial shock engendered by the release of the county quotas , a number of allotment committees settled down to make a conscientious effort to eliminate the overstatement in producers ' claims . This proved to be much less difficult in some counties than was expected ; in others it proved to be almost impossible . In any case , the good example set by these counties , whether they were successful in removing the overstatement or not , was gradually followed by others . Moreover , much was learned from these " pioneers " concerning the kinds of overstatement most common and the ways of discovering them . State boards of review , supervisors , state committeemen , and junior statisticians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspecting and analyzing a sample group of contracts , that all or most of the overstatement could be removed without penalizing producers whose claims were correct . A great many of the adjustments in corn acreage and corn yields were made by flat percentage cuts on all the contracts . Because the flat cuts were usually small and because contract provisions were modified during the summer so that the cut in the corn acreage did not necessitate much revision in farming operations , these cuts entailed little hardship on most individual producers . One Footnote  | reason for the relatively small amount of overstatement in the corn acreage claimed was that committeemen in many states checked 1933 corn acreage claimed against corn stubble at the time yield appraisals were being made . The corn acreage allowed producers on completed contracts exceeded the county quotas by less than 1 per cent . The average corn yield allowed on contract applications exceeded the average 1924-33 United States yield by 3.6 bushels per acre . or 14 per cent . This was largely due to the above-average yields allowed in minor producing states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields were no higher and frequently slightly lower , than the ten-year average for the state . The serious adjustment problem developed in connection with producers ' overstatement in the number of hogs raised for market . Though there was some demand that flat cuts to remove most or all of this overstatement be allowed , few such cuts of any appreciable size were approved by state boards of review.17 They had received definite instructions not to do so , and time and again the attention of local officials was drawn to the inequality and injustice that would result from the adoption of such a procedure . Instead , allotment committeemen had to examine the contracts and supporting evidence minutely . They found three major causes of overstatement : ( 1 ) many hogs farrowed prior to December 1 , 1931 , though marketed in 1932 and 1933 , were included in the hog base because many producers failed to appreciate that it was the time the hogs were farrowed that counted and not the time they were marketed ; ( 2 ) many feeder pigs were included in the hogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them instead of being included in his Footnote  | feeder pig base ; " ( 3 ) a number of producers in almost every county submitted fictitious claims for hogs raised in 1932 and 1933 , frequently submitting falsified evidence to substantiate these claims . The proportion of farmers who made false claims was low , but many of those who did make them falsified on a large scale . Two less important causes of the overstatement were the tendency on the part of applicants to reserve many less hogs for farm slaughter from 1933 farrowing than were actually so slaughtered in 1932 , and to include in the base some pigs farrowed after December 1 , 1933 . Only a few counties did a very poor job of removing ineligible hogs , but a very considerable number failed to keep any systematic record of the number of hogs they had removed or why they had removed them . These allotment committees were in constant trouble , particularly when producers demanded reasons for the removal of hogs from their contracts . Careful and conscientious committees gave every producer an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting evidence . Invariably this resulted in putting back some hogs . Yet these same committees had less difficulty than most others in coming down to the county quota . Moreover , farmers in these counties were satisfied that everyone had been accorded fair and equal treatment . As a result , they were more willing to continue to support the AAA in general , and present and future corn-hog programs in particular , than were farmers in counties where contracts may not have been adjusted any more but where , the adjustments were carelessly or inequitably made . The pressure for revision of the hogs-for-market Footnote  | quotas continued throughout the whole period in which adjustments were being made . In many major states all the adjustment required was finally made , but in a few some relaxation of the quotas seemed necessary if the contracts were ever to be completed . In these states the board of review was given authority to release contracts for transmittal to Washington even though all the required adjustment had not been made , provided the board or its authorized agents could find no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to " clear " the contracts for at least some counties in Indiana , Illinois , Iowa , and South Dakota . In Kansas , Nebraska , Missouri , and Minnesota the contract data on hogs for market as finally approved checked very closely with the original quotas . The boards of review in these states , in the absence of any real proof that the quotas in counties which were the slowest in making adjustments were not equitable , felt that to allow any increase in quotas to these laggards was simply putting a premium on procrastination ! ' Perhaps the most difficulty in reconciling producers ' claims and county quotas was encountered in Iowa and Oregon . After about 6 million dollars had been disbursed to Iowa farmers , further payments were tern-Footnote  | porarily suspended by the AAA " pending a re-check of the county hog quotas . . . when checking work in the Rental Benefit Audit Section indicated that a discrepancy , presumably due to misunderstanding or to errors in calculation , existed between the aggregate of the county quotas actually used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by the Department of Agriculture . " L1 Random samples of the contracts in all but six or eight Iowa counties were checked by employees of the Corn-Hog Section . In some counties the inspection was nominal , in others more than one inspection was made . Perhaps 10 per cent of the difference between the original contract totals and the original state quota was removed as the result of the re-check , which was naturally very unpopular . In Oregon the hog production reported on contract applications exceeded the preliminary estimate of hog production for the state by more than Ioo per cent and the state contract quota by 50 per cent . The Oregon extension service vigorously upheld the producers ' contention that this quota was much too low and attempted to prove it by obtaining from all buyers of Oregon hogs a complete statement of such purchases . This " census " did indeed show purchases greatly in excess of the state quota . But federal officials claimed that there was considerable " double counting " of one kind or another in it . Contract quotas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the AAA , though state officials claimed the analysis was arbitrarily made by persons unfamiliar with hog production in that area . The chief criticism of the quotas by producers every-Footnote  | where was based on their belief that the quotas had been established by comparing the contract application claims with check data that under-reported hog numbers . Where assessors ' reports had been used , farmers claimed that they had consistently under-reported sows or hogs marketed in order to escape taxation . Where rural carrier reports had been used , they claimed that they had underreported so as to mislead packers or " the market " and maintain prices at a higher level than otherwise would have been reached . It was claimed that census reports and practically all the other check data were likewise biased downward for these or similar reasons . To such charges the AAA and the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates replied : ( I ) that completely independent checks , such as reports of hogs actually marketed , corroborated survey and assessors ' reports ; ( 2 ) that such reports as seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that these reports were used as a relative and not as an absolute indication of overstatement ; and ( q. ) that among the indications considered in arriving at the quotas were the contract data themselves . No doubt state boards tended to defend a more extreme position with regard to quotas than the adequacy and accuracy of their check data warranted ; but in the major areas , at least , there seems good reason to believe that the majority of the county quotas leaned toward liberality . " It must be , admitted , however , that ineligible hogs Footnote  | may have been camouflaged so carefully that it was impossible to find them . To cut down contract data arbitrarily to quotas in these cases did penalize the producers who had reported correctly . It is probable that some eligible hogs were removed from some contracts in all counties.23 In counties making flat percentage cuts , some eligible hogs were almost certainly removed from some contracts . Some counties frankly admitted that they removed eligible hogs from the contracts of producers with large hog bases in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficient or partisan committees the number of eligible hogs removed was naturally above average . COMPLETING CONTRACTS In spite of this radical downward readjustment in the claims of most producers , some of it rather inequitably made , more than 98 per cent of the original applications were completed and forwarded to Washington for payment . To a considerable extent this high proportion of completed contracts was due either directly or indirectly to the exceptionally severe drought in 1934 . In the first place , certain contract provisions were greatly modified as a result of this drought ; second , compliance was made easier ; and third , benefit payments constituted the major source of income of many farmers in the regions most affected . The relaxation of a number of the provisions of the corn-hog contract constituted one of the measures undertaken to ameliorate the effects of the 1934 drought . Successive relaxations of the provisions of the corn-hog contract during May and June permitted the pasturing Footnote  | of contracted acres ( May 23 ) , the growing of excess forage and fodder crops and fodder corn ( May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pasture and forage crops except corn on'contracted acres ( June 5 ) , and the growing of corn for forage on contracted acres ( June 30 ) . At first only farmers in officially designated drought counties were given the advantage of these modifications , but later they were made applicable everywhere . At the time of the modification , opinion was sharply divided on the advisability and necessity of " releasing " the contracted acres . About the middle of May most extension directors and the state corn-hog committees , in response to an inquiry from the Corn-Hog Section , stated that this would be inadvisable . Queried again two weeks later , opinion was divided about 50-50 on the matter . Most members of the section felt that plenty of land was available for planting " excess " corn and forage crops without releasing contracted acres for the purpose . There was , however , considerable political pressure , and pressure from within the AAA , for such a modification ; and as it turned out , it was probably advisable because of the continued severity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contract signers in areas where rainfall was from moderate to normal . In many cases these farmers harvested as much as or more feed than they would have done if they had not signed contracts.2 ' But even farmers were by no means unanimously agreed that the restrictions on contract acres should be removed . They felt that it might lessen the signer 's respect for the contractual obligations of succeeding contracts , as well as the remaining obligations Footnote  | of existing contracts ; that farmers would expect similar relaxations to continue ; that " chiseling " would increase ; and that non-compliance might become so large as to defeat in whole or in part the objective of the program . Many AAA officials felt that these objections to relaxing contract provisions were valid , but hoped through the development of other methods of control to do away with the complicated individual commodity contracts to which they were most applicable . The relaxation of contract restrictions , as well as many of the other drought relief measures of 1934 , was initiated prior to or during the period in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced a very different set of conditions when the " adjusted " contract was offered to them for final signature than they had faced when the contract application was signed . Grain prices had risen sharply in the meantime ; but high grain prices afforded no reason for refusing to complete a contract when a crop failure seemed inevitable . Moreover , the restrictions with regard to crop production had been so greatly relaxed that the great majority could adjust their farming operations almost as freely as they wished and still comply with the modified contract provisions . Nor did the status of their hog enterprise cause compliance difficulties for the majority of producers , even though material revisions were made in the base production and consequently permitted production of many producers . In the first place , hog prices remained low , especially in relation to corn prices . The drought , causing as it did an increase in the marketings of hogs and other livestock in the summer of 1934 , made the hog enterprise seem still more unprofitable . Producers reacted  | as usual to an unfavorable corn-hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done this even in the complete absence of a reduction program . Thus no inconsiderable number of producers had no need , so far as 1934 hog production was concerned , for a base even as large as that on the adjusted contract . The attitude of these producers was : Here I am getting paid for something I was going to do anyway ; why should I refuse to sign simply because I am not getting paid quite as much as I first expected ? At all events , the modification of the contract restrictions facilitated completion of the corn-hog contracts . No doubt the final sign-up would have been nearly as high even if no modifications in the contract had been made ; for it would have been to the producer 's financial advantage to sign , especially where the drought was serious . But the modifications did improve the attitude of producers toward the program and tended to offset the antagonism growing out of the contract adjustments . Most contracts were completed at final sign-up meetings in June , July , and August 1934 , but variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corn-hog contracts were received in Washington in greatest volume in August and September , though the first batch was received on April 1 o and contracts continued to straggle in until the end of the year . The Rental and Benefit Audit Section of the Comptrollers ' Office received the contracts , checked them to make sure that they had been adjusted in accordance with the requirements of the state board of review , audited all the items in them , computed the amount of the first benefit payments , and released the records prepared from these contracts to the disbursing office of the  | Treasury Department for the preparation and forwarding of checks to contract signers. i5 About 3 per cent of the contracts contained errors which necessitated cor-Figure respondence with the county association and contract signer before they could be cleared for payment . The major steps in making payments are shown in the accompanying chart . Usually not less than two weeks elapsed between the day a block of contracts was received and the day checks were forwarded to the county from Washington . First payments began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the daily volume of corn-hog checks written reached the million-dollar mark for the first time on July 28.2 ' 6 Most of the first instalment of corn and Footnote  | hog payments had been disbursed by the end of October . ( See the accompanying chart . ) On corn these Figure amounted to nearly 56 million dollars , and on hogs to over 8 i million . PARTICIPATION OF PRODUCERS About 1.1 million farmers completed 1934 corn-hog reduction contracts.27 This represents only a small fraction , perhaps not more than 25 per cent , of all farmers growing corn and 6o or 7o per cent of all farmers far- Footnote  | rowing hogs ' The participants were located in every one of the 48 states , the number of contracts ranging from seven in Maine and ten in Rhode Island to nearly 121,000 in Illinois and over 173,000 in Iowa . It was , however , the larger corn and hog raisers who participated , and so the volume of production under contract represented a considerably larger proportion of total production than a mere comparison of the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates . Even so , contract signers planted not much more than 50 per cent of the average acreage of corn grown in 1932 and 1933.29 Over 85 per cent of the corn land under contract was located in the ten Corn Belt states , though less than two-thirds of all the land in corn in 1932 and 1933 was in this area . The contracted acres represented just under 24 per cent of the base acreage of contract signers . Naturally , most of the contracted acres were located in the Corn Belt . In most states , contract signers who rented any corn land at all to the Secretary rented 25 per cent or Footnote  | more , but the average for the state was pulled down by exceptions to the provision requiring at least a 20 per cent reduction in the land in corn . In 1932 and 1933 , contract signers raised somewhat less than 77 per cent of the total number of hogs raised and sold , or slaughtered for consumption on the farm . According to the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The corn-hog contracts listed an average of nearly 10.5 million sows farrowed in 1932 and 1933 by signers.30 Thus 76 per cent of all the litters farrowed in 1932 and 1933 were farrowed by signatories to 1934 corn-hog contracts.31 Nearly 84 per cent of the litters farrowed by contract signers in 1932 and 1933 were farrowed in the ten Corn Belt states , whereas less than 75 per cent of all litters farrowed in 1932 and 1933 were farrowed in this area . There were about 81.4 million " pigs saved " annually in 1932 and 1933 , according to the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates . Perhaps 74 million , or 91 per cent , were raised to disposal age . Contract signers marketed just under 54 million hogs in the base years32 and slaughtered 3.6 million for home use . Hence the number of hogs raised to disposal age by the contract signers represented 77 per cent of all hogs raised in 1932 and Footnote  | 1933 . A larger though unknown percentage of 1932-33 commercial hog marketings was raised by contract signers because the " sign-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger producers elsewhere . These producers characteristically raise the commercial supply . The difficulty of estimating the proportion of the commercial production under contract is due to the fact that the hogs raised for market reported by contract signers included many hogs sold to rural and urban consumers . Such hogs are not included in estimates of commercial slaughter . Less than 20,000 contracts or 1.7 per cent of the applications were not completed . According to the reports of a dozen extension directors , about one-half of these applications were not completed because the adjustments made on them were refused by the applicants . The other half were not completed because for one reason or another the producer was " ineligible . " Perhaps in many of these cases the ineligibility was due to the fact that the producer was unable to comply with the provisions of the application at the time it was ready for final signature . There seems to have been a slight tendency for the percentage of applications not completed to be lowest in states where the drought was most severe . COMPLIANCE The concluding step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance and the subsequent distribution of the second and third instalments of the rental and benefit payments.33 The corn-hog contract in its original form allowed the producer ( with a single exception ) only one alternative to complete compliance . This alternative was for the signer to return his benefit payments and have the Footnote  | contract cancelled . In this respect the corn-hog contract was no different from other commodity contracts . But , primarily because of the delay in completing corn-hog contracts , late in the summer of 1934 violators were offered an alternative to cancellation . They could elect to pay a " penalty " for each violation . This unique system of penalties was developed largely as a result of promises , both direct and implied , that special consideration would be given to cases of unintentional violation largely due to the unavoidable delay in completing contracts.34 In some cases this delay had made it impossible for a producer to comply . Relying on the original representations in his contract application , which he honestly believed and which indeed may have been correct , he may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to do under the terms of the adjusted contract . In other cases , the producer could have made the necessary adjustments had not the unprecedented severity of the drought made the destruction of feed or food supplies inexped ? nt . In still other cases , producers thought they had fulfilled their contractual obligations but found when compliance was being checked that they had mistaken the size of a field or overlooked an important ruling . Three penalty rates were established for each of ten major kinds of - violation . " The maximum deduction was made for intentional or unexplained violations ; the minimum for satisfactorily explained unintentional violations ; the intermediate for those neither expressly intentional nor entirely unexplainable violations which Footnote  | nevertheless did not satisfy the requirements for a minimum deduction . The penalty rate assessed was determined largely by the recommendations of the county allotment committee and local supervisors . While purely arbitrary , these rates were designed to offset the probable financial gain accruing to the producer by reason of his violation . The maximum penalty of 45 cents on corn " was equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price at the time . If the maximum rate had been rigidly applied the net penalty ? the difference between the penalty assessed and the value of the " illegal " product ? depended entirely on the value of that product . Over large areas where most if not all of the crop was a complete or partial failure , the penalty greatly outweighed the value of the " illegal " crop . In sections where crop production was average or better , the reverse was true . There was , however , some tendency to assess a larger absolute penalty in areas where the crop was good than where it was very poor . Producers who offered to accept and were assessed this type of penalty retained the " excess " product for the production of which they had been penalized . In the case of excess hogs the producer could , and usually did , adopt another type of " penalty " which in effect resulted in complete compliance . Producers were permitted to donate their excess hogs to qualified relief organizations . The detailed procedure was determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the state relief administrator . Consequently , it varied considerably from state to state . In all , about 8o,000 pigs weighing between 30 and 90 pounds were turned over Footnote  | to local relief units . The largest number , about 21,000 , was donated in Iowa , but relative to the number of hogs under contract the proportion donated in this state was no larger than in most other states . The provisions for assessing penalties and for disposing of excess hogs did not simplify the actual checking of compliance , which was complicated by two important differences between the obligations of corn-hog contract signers and those of signers of other commodity contracts . The first of these was the obligation to reduce hog production , which raised a host of problems in connection with compliance not encountered when the major obligation was to reduce acreage , as in the wheat and cotton programs . The second was the all-inclusive character of the " supplementary " provision of the corn-hog contract . The original contract proposed to control the production , or at least the acreage , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the acreage of corn and the number of hogs raised for market . With this object in mind , provisions were inserted limiting the total acreage of feed crops , of other " basic " crops , and of total crops , as well as the use to which the acres retired from corn production could be put , and so on . These provisions constituted the most ambitious attempt on the part of the AAA to prevent curtailment in the production of one commodity from resulting in " surpluses " of others . The problem of compliance , however , was simplified in some respects b ; the drought . In the first place , the relaxation of the supplementary provisions that resulted from the drought obviated the necessity of making anything more than the most cursory inspection with respect to compliance with these provisions . The release of the contracted acres for a wide variety of uses in many cases made a careful inspection of this land unnecessary  | ? for one reason because additional land was frequently available for and eligible as contracted acres . Undoubtedly many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contract automatically complied with its modified terms . In the second place , because of the drought , county allotment committees were " permitted to authorize supervisors to make certification by visual inspection rather than measurement " 37 ( 1 ) of all fields for which corn yields promised to be less than 40 per cent of the adjusted appraised yield of the contracted acres ; ( 2 ) of rented or contracted acres " where it was perfectly evident that much more land is available than is required for the purpose " ; ( 3 ) for compliance with the supplementary provisions of the contract unless it appeared that , in spite of all the modifications in these provisions , the signer had managed to violate one or more of them . The actual field work of checking compliance was done by " supervisors " under the direction of the county allotment committee and supervised by state compliance officials . As in other phases of the program , the federal and state extension services bore a large part of the responsibility , particularly in instructing local supervisors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance were made in September , October , and November 1934 . At that time compliance certificates were prepared and forwarded to Washington for all producers who had complied with the acreage provisions of their contracts , and whose hogs sold or to be sold did not exceed the permitted number by more than 5 per cent . More than 85 per cent of all corn-hog signers could Footnote  | be immediately certified as in complete compliance with their contracts ; two-thirds of the remainder elected to make the adjustments necessary to comply with their contracts . In about 32,000 cases , or 3 per cent of all cases , producers were unable or unwilling to make the necessary adjustments and elected to accept the penalty alternative . Most of these violators had too much corn for grain . The same procedure was followed in making the final check of compliance with respect to hog production . Most of these inspections were made during the first half of December and as of November 30 , 1934 , the termination date of the 1934 contract . Less than 1 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having violated the provisions with respect to hog production . Most of these violations had to do with feeder pig purchases , or the number of hogs slaughtered or to be slaughtered for home consumption . The procedure used in making second and third payments from certification forms was the same as that used in making first payments from the contracts . It was complicated , however , by ( 1 ) the necessity of making sure that the provisions limiting the aggregate production of corn on the non-contract farms of contract signers had not been violated ; ( 2 ) the necessity of deducting the local association expenses from the second corn payment and the third hog payment ; ( 3 ) the necessity of assessing , calculating , and deducting the penalties for violations from the second and third payments . Total deductions for partial compliance may amount to about $400,000 . Second payments were made in largest volume in January and February 1935 . The second corn payment amounted to 50 million dollars and the second hog pay-  | ment to 40 million . The final hog payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last half of March and April 1935 . ( See the chart on page 121 . ) Payments on contracts for which penalties had to be assessed did not start until about the first of May . On August 1 , 1935 , one or more payments still remained to be made on about 12,000 of the 1934 contracts . This was partly because some partial compliance cases remained unsettled but for the most part resulted from other contract complications . The compliance experience of the AAA in the 1934 corn-hog program provides no criterion by which to forecast what may be expected in future programs . The amount of reported violation was exceptionally small and much of it appeared to be unintentional . Indeed , for a small group of violators , non-compliance was strictly " technical . " These producers knew the size of their fields , had first-class evidence supporting their hog base , and made every effort to comply with the provisions of the contract . But the bona fide representations on these contracts may have been arbitrarily cut in order to reach or approach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with too much corn for grain or too many hogs for market . In this group were those producers who , in spite of the most conscientious effort , misinterpreted one or more of the provisions or modifications or failed to obtain information on rulings of one kind or another.38 For a larger group of violators , non-compliance was the result of carelessness rather than intention . These violators did not know the exact size of their fields and did not take the trouble to find out . They did not know Footnote  | just what they were and were not permitted to do , and did not bother to become informed , even when the information was readily available . If the contract provisions had not been relaxed , many producers who were certified as having complied in full would have fallen into this group . Probably some " technical " and some careless violators were never reported by compliance supervisors . This happened in spite of the AAA promise that such violators would be leniently dealt with . Supervisors and allotment committeemen tended to be lenient with these violators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Adjustment Administration . No doubt the development of a system of penalties resulted in more reported cases of these kinds of non-compliance than would otherwise have been the case . On the other hand , most of the same local authorities carefully reported all cases of intentional non-compliance that came to their attention , even though nature had conspired to defeat the intentions of the violator . Some signers deliberately overplanted corn , or raised more hogs for market than they were permitted even according to the representations they made on the contract applications . They may have expected that the compliance check would be merely a matter of form , or they may have hoped to plan ways of evading it . No doubt this same group of producers was largely responsible for most of the deliberate overstatement on contract applications . No doubt , too , some of this group of producers got by with both overstatement and non-compliance.39 Footnote  | The incentive to violate the 1934 corn-hog contract was very small , however , first because of the effects of the drought , and second because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce hog production anyway . There was certainly little incentive deliberately to plan to produce too many hogs . Most violations of the hog production provisions of the contract were due to unusual luck in saving pigs or to an unexpectedly large adjustment in the base . Even in these cases the gain that seemed likely to result from evading compliance did not seem worth the risk involved . Thus most producers turned their " excess " hogs over to the local relief unit . it would seem that there was a conscious or unconscious effort to become informed regarding current operations .  | FINANCING THE CORN-HOG PROGRAM The 1934 corn-hog reduction program involved gross rental and benefit payments of about 312 million dollars ? I 10 million for corn rental and 202 million for hog benefit payments . Other expenditures incurred by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in its efforts to increase the income of the producers of corn and hogs included 32 million dollars spent during the emergency hog marketing campaign , 11 million for purchasing ( in co-operation with the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation ) hogs for relief distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 31 , 1935 ) ? a total of 362 million dollars . These expenditures were made , in the main , out of the revenue derived from a tax on the " first domestic processing " of hogs . The Agricultural Adjustment Act provided for the collection of processing taxes on the first domestic processing of any basic agricultural commodity with respect to which the Secretary of Agriculture had determined to make rental or benefit payments . ' The tax which was to go into effect at the beginning of the marketing year next following the date on which the Secretary proclaimed that rental or benefit payments were to be made was to be at a rate equal to the difference between the current average farm price for the commodity and its fair exchange value , except where the imposition of this Footnote 133  | commodity domestically consumed as to result in an accumulation of stocks or depression of prices . In the event that this contingency seemed probable , the Secretary was empowered to fix the tax at such a rate as would prevent it . On August 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain advances from the Treasury to finance the emergency hog marketing campaign , the Secretary of Agriculture announced that benefit payments were to be made with respect to hogs , ' though no decision concerning the rate of the tax or the date that it was to take effect had at the time been made . The AAA was convinced that the imposition of the full legal rate ( about $4.70 a hundredweight ) would depress farm prices . A public hearing was held on September 5 , 1933 at which interested parties were afforded an opportunity to suggest a rate which would prevent this depression in farm prices and to present their arguments in support of the suggested rate . ' At the same time , an " appropriate investigation " was made by the AAA and a decision on the matter finally reached . On October 19 , 1933 the Secretary announced that the initial rate of processing tax on hogs would be 50 cents a hundredweight ; that the rate would be increased to $1.00 on December 1 , to $1.50 on January 1 , 1934 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the next marketing year would begin November 5 , 1933 , the initial tax thus becoming effective as of that date . On December 22 , 1933 , when it appeared probable that hog marketings would continue to be heavy through January 1934 , the rate increase scheduled for January I was postponed to February 1 , the rate effective on and after March i being increased to $2.25 . This rate Footnote  | was thereafter continued in effect , the Secretary not having deemed that an " effectuation of the declared policy " required any change in it . One reason for the decision to make the initial tax low was the provision in the Agricultural Adjustment Act which required the collection of a " floor stocks " tax on stocks in storage at a rate equivalent to the initial processing tax when the latter was put into effect . It was felt that a high initial rate of processing tax with a concomitant high floor stocks tax would cause the dumping of storage stocks of pork and lard , which were unusually large , and depress hog prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act did not require the collection of additional floor stocks taxes whenever the rate of processing tax was changed , so that this difficulty was no longer a factor after the initial rate had been put into effect . ' Not all hogs slaughtered were taxable , however , and refunds of taxes were required by the act to be made on export and on sale to charitable organizations . These exemptions and refunds obviously reduced the net revenue from the tax . Producers were exempt from the payment of processing taxes on hogs slaughtered for use on the , farm . Consumers who bought live hogs for home use were likewise exempt . Producers , moreover , who did not sell more than i , 000 pounds of hog products annually were exempt from the payment of processing taxes on sales up to 300 pounds . ' No exemptions were al-Footnote  | lowed on sales by producers when these sales exceeded 1,000 pounds annually . The Agricultural Adjustment Act also authorized the collection of " compensatory " taxes on imports of hog products and on products competing with hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of preventing " excessive shifts in consumption , " not of raising revenue , and in practice they added little to the receipts from processing taxes proper . The " mandatory " tax on imports of hogs and hog products yielded little because such imports are almost negligible . The " permissive " tax on products competing with hogs ( beef , mutton , poultry , even fish ) was not levied , for one reason because it could not be shown that the processing tax on hogs resulted in disadvantages in competition to processors of hogs since the same group likewise processed other kinds of livestock . There was also a processing tax on the first domestic processing of corn for non-feed uses . It became effective at the beginning of the marketing year next following the Secretary 's announcement that rental payments were to be made to producers for reducing corn production . On October 24 , 1933 the Secretary announced that the full legal rate of tax ? 28 cents per bushel ? would become effective November 5 . On November 2 and 3 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing on the effect of this rate on commercial corn consumption and on corn prices . As a result of the evidence presented at this hearing , particularly that relating to the competition between corn sugar and beet and cane sugar , and an investigation by the AAA , the initial rate was reduced to 5 cents . A Footnote  | scheduled increase of the rate to 20 cents on December I was countermanded on November 30 , and no further changes in the rate were made . There was , finally , a compensatory tax on imports of corn . Little revenue could be expected from this tax , however , since corn imports , though unusually large following the short corn crop of 1934 , remained small relative to United States production . No compensatory tax was levied on products competing with corn , although such a tax had considerable revenue producing possibilities . Had a high corn processing tax been levied , resulting in competitive disadvantages to corn processors , compensatory taxes on the processing of beet and cane sugar , molasses , starch , sago , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was partly to avoid the difficulties incident to the levying and collection of such compensatory taxes that the processing tax rate on corn was set and maintained at only 5 cents a bushel . The overwhelming importance of the processing tax on hogs as a source of revenue for financing the corn-hog program is indicated in the following table , which shows receipts and refunds of processing and related taxes on hogs and corn up to February 28 , 1935 , in millions of dollars : Table  | The receipts from floor stocks taxes , indeed , can scarcely be considered as permanent revenue since , if and when the processing taxes are removed , refunds on floor stocks at a rate equivalent to the processing tax have to be made . Thus if the $2.25 tax on hog processing were removed , refunds on floor stocks would greatly exceed original collections on them . ' Gross and net tax collections through June 1935 are shown on the accompanying chart . Figure Footnote  | In addition to being levied at a rate less than the legal maximum , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique in another respect . It was levied for more than one year to pay for a one-year reduction program . This grew , on the one hand , out of the difficulty of financing the large benefit payments as well as the emergency measures from the proceeds of a tax levied at less than the maximum legal rate ; and , on the other , out of the impossibility of collecting enough revenue from taxes on the small volume of corn processed for non-feed uses to equal the rental payments for corn reduction . This latter difficulty was in part overcome by allocating for corn rental payments some 37 million dollars from the Ioo million dollar Bankhead fund which the National Industrial Recovery Act had appropriated outright for facilitating the carrying out of the objectives of the Agricultural Adjustment Act . ' It was expected that about one-half of the expenditures for corn rental payments could be met by this 37 million dollars and the receipts from the processing taxes on corn . This forecast turned out to be rather accurate , in spite of the decrease in the revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5 cents a bushel , solely because corn rental payments turned out to be 50 million dollars less than was initially forecast . This still left the remainder of the rental payments Footnote  | for corn reduction , all the benefit payments for hog reduction , the expenses of the emergency hog marketing campaign and relief purchases of hogs , and administrative expenses to be paid out of the processing tax on hogs . In order to raise the revenue necessary for these purposes , even when the tax was fixed at the highest " practical " rate , it was decided to levy it for a period of two years . While this procedure was determined upon largely on the basis of expediency , considerable justification for it can be found in the fact that the measures undertaken were also expected to maintain or increase hog prices for two years ? for the 1933-34 marketing year by the two emergency measures , and for the 1934-35 marketing year by the 1934 reduction campaign . If this reasoning had been strictly adhered to , tax collections in 1933-34 would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign and the relief purchases . Actually more than three times the 43 million dollar cost of these measures was collected from the tax on 1933-34 hog marketings . In spite of the accumulation of this " surplus " revenue from the tax on 1933-34 hog marketings , disbursements to the end of the 1934 corn-hog reduction program promise to exceed revenue up to the end of the two-year taxation period by from 15 to 20 million dollars . This " deficit " was due to a combination of circumstances , some of which could not have been foreseen . The preparation of the corn-hog budget was no simple task , though use was made of all the information available . In the first place , the budget was based to a considerable extent either directly or indirectly upon a series of more or less accurate guesses ? they could hardly have been called estimates , since the latter presupposes at least some past experience or sample data as a  | starting point . The corn-hog budget involved a guess as to the rate of tax that would not result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a guess as to the volume of corn and hog reduction that would be signed up on contracts ; a guess as to the net taxable volume of corn and hog marketings , which in turn involved a guess as to exports , exemptions , and gifts to charitable institutions ; a guess as to percentage of corn land rented to the government ; a guess as to its yield ; and even a guess as to the amount of tax evasion . It involved estimates of corn and hog production in 1932 and 1933 , estimates of the costs of the emergency hog marketing campaign , estimates of the cost of relief purchases of hogs and hog products , and estimates of administrative costs . In view of all these difficulties , a wide margin of safety would have been desirable . Actually , the cornhog budget was never more than just barely in balance , and though two items of " cost " were materially overestimated , the receipts from processing taxes ran even further below expectations . Total expenditures to the end of the 1934 program were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 430 million dollars . This discrepancy was due ( 1 ) to a much smaller corn acreage sign-up than had been figured on , corn rental payments actually amounting to I Io million dollars as compared with an original estimate of 165 million dollars ; and ( 2 ) to the fact that expenditures for relief purchases of hogs amounted to only 11 million dollars instead of the estimated 3o million . Footnote  | Processing and related tax receipts up to the end of the 1934-35 marketing year promise to be about 8o million dollars less than the original forecast of 394 million . This difference between facts and forecasts must be laid to three factors : ( 1 ) tax evasion , particularly on hog processing ; ( 2 ) failure to increase the processing tax rate on corn from 5 to 20 cents a bushel ; and ( 3 ) a reduction in hog marketings in 1934-35 double the reduction expected at the time the budget was prepared . In the preparation of its budget , the Corn-Hog Section assumed that there would be a net reduction of 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 31 , 1935 . This assumption was based upon the belief that the 25 per cent decrease made by 1934 contract signers would be offset in part by the action of nonsigners in maintaining or increasing production . As it turned out , owing to an unusually unfavorable corn-hog ratio and the severe drought , hog production in 1934 was reduced nearly twice as much as was expected when the budget was prepared . ' This accounts for nearly half the difference between actual receipts of processing taxes and forecasted receipts . The revenue from processing taxes on corn was only 25 per cent of the receipts that would have been obtained if the processing tax rate on corn had been increased to 20 cents a bushel as was originally contemplated . " This reduction in receipts from processing taxes on corn accounts for perhaps a fifth of the " deficit . " The remaining deficit was due to tax evasion of one Footnote  | kind or another . Since exemptions have not been materially different from budget estimates , the extent of the evasion is indicated by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 1 , 1934 were only 169 million dollars , whereas up to October 31 , about 173 million dollars was due on federally inspected slaughter and an additional 43 million on nonfederally inspected slaughter . " This allows for a twomonth lag in collections.12 Perhaps the lag between processing and collection is longer than two months , but it can scarcely be nearly five months as would be necessary if the disparity between actual and estimated collections were to be fully accounted for on this basis . A certain amount of reorganization of hog marketing procedure to take advantage of exemptions was bound to occur . Thus meat retailers in small towns and villages , particularly in the Mid-West , claimed that their sales of pork products to farmers declined materially . Farmers who used to sell hogs and buy back the product began to slaughter for their own use . Farmers who did not raise hogs found it worth while to buy live hogs from their neighbors and slaughter them . Other consumers felt the same way . This method of " evading " the tax was legal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption are geographically far apart , most of the Footnote  | processing and distribution of hog products was bound to remain in the hands of packers , who found it both difficult and dangerous to evade the tax even if they wished to . Moreover , one should hasten to add that the major portion of the packing industry adequately reported taxable slaughter . Evasion was apparently most common among a group of packers , bulking large in number but handling a relatively small portion of the total , who tended to underreport both the number and weight of hogs slaughtered . To a less extent taxes were evaded by producer " peddlers , " and perhaps by retailers who did their own slaughtering . It was difficult to prevent this type of evasion completely , but , in any event , it does not appear to have been important . The evasion of processing taxes on hogs seems to have been somewhat larger than one would expect and was probably somewhat larger than it would be after the Bureau of Internal Revenue had gained experience in collecting such taxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate . Up to December 31 , 1934 , the AAA had been billed for 4 million dollars by the Bureau of Internal Revenue for collecting approximately 641 million dollars in all processing and related taxes . Allocated to the several commodities in proportion to the revenue collected from the several taxes , this cost represents o.6 per cent of collections . Total administrative costs ( about 18.6 million dollars ) were of two kinds ? expenses paid directly by the AAA as part of the overhead , and the administrative expenses of the 2,200 county corn-hog control associations . The former , amounting to about 6.9 million dollars , were charged against the corn-hog program and paid directly out of processing taxes . The latter , amounting to about 11.7 million dollars , were deducted from the  | rental and benefit payments due contract signers.13 Thus the amount received by producers as rental and benefit payments in connection with the 1934 corn-hog program was approximately 300 rather than 312 million dollars . Most of the local association expense , however , consisted of salaries and per diem paid to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent , and on the average about 75 per cent , of the local association budgets went for salaries and per diem of committeemen and supervisors , and the remainder for equipment and supplies , publishing contract signers ' production claims , secretary 's salaries , and similar expenses . For the United States as a whole , something less than 4 per cent of the gross rental and benefit payments had to be deducted to operate the local associations . The percentage deduction , however , varied greatly from county to county , even within the same state . In some counties , less than 2 per cent of the gross rental and benefit payments had to be deducted for local administrative expense ; in other counties as much as 20 per cent had to be deducted.14 As a general rule , the percentage deducted decreased as the gross rental and benefit payments increased . Few counties with $300,000 or more rental and benefit payments deducted more than 4 per cent for local expenses . In counties where rental and benefit payments were less than $100,000 , 8 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense per contract varied widely , being as low as $1.00 and as high as $25.00 , there was no tendency for it to decrease as the number of contracts in a Footnote  | county increased ; but the expense per contract tended to increase rather sharply as the benefit payments per contract increased . The average expense account in 1934 was probably somewhat larger than it would be in succeeding years . The cost of checking compliance might be greater , but most other expenses should be materially less . If the 1932-33 base were to be maintained , the allotment committee should not have to spend much time adjusting contracts for overstatement . The major problem might be to prevent committeemen from making jobs for themselves . " ' The percentage of benefit payments deducted for local administrative costs is significant only in comparing one county with another . This percentage varies not only with the expenses incurred but also with the volume of benefit payments . Deductions for local expenses equal to perhaps so per cent of rental and benefit payments might not be unreasonable if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to producers would presumably come about through the enhancement of market prices . Expenses consequently should be related to gains from the program as a whole rather than to benefit payments alone . The estimated administrative expenses ( excluding tax collection costs computed at 1.6 million dollars ) paid by the AAA in connection with the 1934 corn-hog re-Footnote  | duction program amounted to about S.3 million dollars . Nearly two-fifths of this sum represents expenses incurred by the federal and state extension services in connection with the 1934 corn-hog program and paid for by the AAA . Most of this 2 million dollars was allocated to and expended by the state extension services . The state extension service expense varied from $1.00 to $2.00 per contract in the Corn Belt states , and from $3.00 to $30.00 per contract in most other states , The expenses of the Corn-Hog Section proper amounted to nearly one-half the total . Included in this term , however , were salaries and expenses of state cornhog committees and other field personnel attached to the Corn-Hog Section . The Bureau of Agricultural Economics expended about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotas and overstatement and in assisting to adjust contracts . The estimated expenses of the Corn-Hog Section and co-operating government agencies in connection with carrying out the 1934 corn-hog program are summarized in the accompanying table : 16 Table Footnote  | LEGALITY OF PROCESSING TAXES Processors at first either did not question the legality of the processing tax or else were willing to give the AAA a chance to prove its worth before taking legal action . For several months after the levying of the tax no suits were filed to restrain collection , and during the entire year 1934 only nine suits were instituted which questioned the legality of the tax . In 1935 , however , a slowly rising tide of proceedings which assumed the proportions of a flood in June and July came into the nation 's courts . Before June 1 , 1935 a total of 20 cases had been filed which sought injunctions to restrain collection of the taxes . On August 1 , 1935 there were approximately 600 such cases awaiting trial , 150 of which were filed by meat processors . In many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been issued , a step which has reduced the monthly income from this source by more than half . The first judicial test of the processing tax was the case of Franklin Process Co. v. Hoosac Mills Corporation , filed in March 1934 and heard in the District Court of Massachusetts . In that case the United States filed a claim with the receivers of the Hoosac Mills , processors of cotton , for some $8o,000 assessed as processing and floor stock taxes . The receivers petitioned that the claim be disallowed on the ground that the Adjustment Act was unconstitutional . The District Court in its decision , handed down on October 19 , 1934 , declared both the processing and floor stock taxes to be valid excises . It found that the act conferred a degree of legislative power upon the Secretary of Agriculture , but hesitated , largely because of lack of precedent , " to declare such delegation unlawful . The Footnote  | third issue , namely , whether the act encroached upon the sovereignty of the several states , was decided in favor of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of the fact that conformity to the act was , the court said , purely voluntary . The receivers filed an appeal subsequent to this decision , and on July 13 , 1935 , the Circuit Court of Appeals by a two to one decision reversed the District Court and disallowed the claim . The decision hinged upon its conclusion that the discretionary powers conferred upon the Secretary were unlawfully delegated by Congress . It found no definite standard or criterion which limited the power of the Secretary , and said , in part : The power to determine what the law shall be , what property shall be affected by taxation or regulation and what standards shall govern the administrative officers in administering acts of Congress , has never been held to be an administrative function . The power to impose a tax and to determine what property shall bear the tax can only be determined by the legislative department of the government ... . No standard or guide is here laid down to determine how the compensating tax shall be fixed or what elements shall be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be determined by the amount necessary to prevent . . . disadvantages in competition . The Court also found that Congress had invaded a field over which it has no control under the Constitution , since the act seeks to regulate and control production within the states , in violation of the powers reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment . It pointed out that " the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce does not authorize it to do so by taking products either of agriculture or industry before they enter interstate commerce , or otherwise to control their production mere-  | ly because their production may indirectly affect interstate commerce . " Immediately after the adverse decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals at Boston similar decisions were rendered by a number of district courts on cases involving the collection of processing taxes on hogs . These courts had obviously been waiting for a precedent to be set by the Circuit Court in the Hoosac Mills case . " Prior to this decision most of the suits to restrain the collection of hog processing taxes had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many larger packers began filing suits and near the end of July the very largest meat processors had joined the procession . Whether the processing tax will eventually be declared legal or illegal by the Supreme Court can not be foretold . The government intends to appeal the decision of the Circuit Court and a final decision by the Supreme Court is likely to be rendered toward the end of 1935 . In the meantime , Congress has taken steps to clarify and make more specific the powers of the Secretary in order to remove the objection of most courts that the act unconstitutionally delegates legislative power , and the decision of the Supreme Court will probably be rendered on the basis of these amendments . Even if the Supreme Court declares the collection of processing taxes to be illegal it will not necessarily mean the abandonment of the adjustment efforts of the AAA . The adjustments could be financed by congressional ap-Footnote  | propriations , for example.20 There remains , however , the serious question of whether Congress is invading the rights of the states in attempting to regulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fate of the whole program may rest . Footnote  | THE 1935 CORN-HOG PROGRAM The 1934 corn-hog reduction contract curtailed production for only one year ? December 1 , 1933 to November 30 , 1934 ? in contrast to the cotton , wheat , and tobacco contracts , which were effective for more than one year . This was due in major part to the difficulties encountered ( because of the large payments for reducing hog production in 1934 ) in attempting to prepare a budget for a longer program . It was necessary , therefore , for the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to turn its attention early to deciding what program , if any , was to follow that of 1934 . THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 1935 CORN-HOG PROGRAM During the winter and spring of 1933-34 , while the Corn-Hog Section was occupied with the administration of the 1934 measure , the Program Planning Division had been attempting to develop a plan of production control that would not involve a series of individual commodity contracts and which would do away with the difficulties incident to co-ordinating their provisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in the field , and prescribed farming operations of contract signers more rigidly than was felt to be either desirable or necessary . Finally , the members of the Program Planning Division and many others , both within and without the AAA , had felt almost from the first that any more permanent plan involved the direct or indirect control not of corn and hogs alone but of all feed grains  | and all livestock . They regarded the provisions in the 1934 corn-hog contract ( and in other commodity contracts ) restricting feed crop acreages and basic commodity production as rather unsatisfactory expedients . The inclusion of beef cattle , flax , barley , rye , and grain sorghums as basic commodities by an amendment ' to the Agricultural Adjustment Act approved April 7 , 1934 emphasized the need of developing some sort of unified contract and at first glance appeared to facilitate it . By mid-summer 1934 it became apparent that the Planning Division was having difficulty in making such plans in time to put them into operation in 1935 . In mid-July , in a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in the hands of a committee appointed by the Agricultural Adjustment Administrator , the chief of the Corn-Hog Section acting as chairman . Members of the general committee and the several sub-committees were drawn from the Adjustment Administration and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics . The Sub-Committee on Economic and Financial Analyses developed the outlines of a plan for reducing production of feed grains in 1935 ( and thereafter ) which it felt would result in an equivalent percentage reduction in hog production , and some reduction in the supply of poultry products and grain-fed cattle , but no material change in the production of dairy products and sheep and lambs . It recommended , however , that the program in 1935 should concern itself with corn production only and that the initiation of the longer time grain program should be postponed until 1936 . In the first place , the sub-committee felt that it would be difficult to develop a comprehensive crop control program for Footnote  | 1935 in the limited time available . In the second place , it seemed desirable to permit producers to replenish their reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been greatly depleted by the drought . The corn enterprise , consequently , seemed to be the only one that could be overdone . As for hogs , the problem seemed to be how to get large enough farrowings in 1935 , rather than how to reduce them . A supplemental reason for recommending a year 's delay in the initiation of general crop control was that the wheat contract had one more year to run . The corn reduction program ( and the feed grain program ) could be put in effect only if a legal way of financing them could be devised . The difficulty was that the Agricultural Adjustment Act required that benefit payments be made directly to the producers of any commodity upon the processing of which it was desired to collect processing taxes . Since only a small revenue could be collected from processing taxes on corn ( and other feed grains ) , the remainder had to be obtained by means of a tax on livestock slaughter . The Legal Division of the AAA finally concluded that no litigation-proof method could be devised that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reductions in acreages of corn and feed grains . ' Consequently , even the simple corn acreage reduction program for 1935 had to be discarded in favor of a plan involving " substantial " benefit payments on hogs . Almost immediately thereafter producers strongly indicated that , regardless of its legal necessity , they desired a continuation of direct hog production control and benefit payments . The Secretary of Agriculture and the administrators Footnote  | of the AAA had consistently maintained that in initiating and carrying out the mandates of the act they would be guided in large part by the decisions of producers . In order to find out what 1934 corn-hog contract signers desired in the way of a 1935 program , in the light of prospective natural and economic conditions , preliminary plans were laid during August 1934 to hold a corn-hog referendum . ' During the second week in September , members of the Corn-Hog Section met with state and county committeemen , extension directors , specialists , and county agents at Indianapolis , Kansas City , and St. Paul , ' for the twofold purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referendum . At these meetings ( and at those later held in local communities immediately preceding the referendum ) emphasis was placed upon the effects of the drought and upon the probability that corn production would be unduly large in 1935 , particularly in view of the reduction in livestock numbers , if no control were exercised over corn acreage . It was pointed out that in the past both corn acreage and yields ha ? cl tended to be above normal immediately following unusually dry years . It was explained that the AAA was proposing to pay benefits to hog producers largely in order to collect taxes for paying for corn reduction , ' that the 1935 program was ex-Footnote  | pected to be temporary only , and that it was to be followed in 1936 by a simpler control plan usually described as a " one contract per farm " system . Those in attendance at these meetings almost unanimously voted for a 1935 program essentially similar to that of 1934.6 The accompanying tabulation shows the Table recommendations made at each of the three Corn Belt meetings with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Footnote  | The next step was to determine whether or not the rank and file of corn-hog producers supported the position taken by their leaders at these regional meetings . During the last half of September , extension specialists , county agents , and committeemen spent the limited time at their disposal in laying plans for and providing community committeemen with the information to be presented at local referendum meetings . The AAA had requested that these be held during the first two weeks of October . Voters had two questions to answer : ( I ) " Do you favor an adjustment program dealing with corn and hogs in 1935 ? " ( 2 ) " Do you favor a one contract per farm ' adjustment program dealing with grains and livestock to become effective in 1936 ? " ' The necessity of getting almost immediately the reaction of producers precluded any elaborate " educational " campaign before the meetings were held . From the point of view of the AAA , this had two unfortunate results . First , only about 35 per cent of the eligible voters$ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the inadequate discussion that preceded the voting left many producers with inaccurate or erroneous impressions of the meaning of the second question , which was ambiguous enough to start with . As a result , only 32 per cent of the eligible voters cast ballots on the second issue . Some producers who voted on the first question omitted to do so on the second because they did not understand it. ? Almost exactly 70 per cent of those who voted cast affirmative ballots on the first question and almost 53 per cent replied in a similar manner on the second . In many counties non-signers were permitted to vote , whether or not they were so permitted being left in the hands of the county allotment committee . In all , 43,000 non-signers voted , 33 per cent affirmatively on the first question , and 28 per cent on the second . The AAA was in general mildly disappointed by the large number of non-voters and the large negative vote , particularly with respect to the second question , and mildly surprised by the number of affirmative votes cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted against a Footnote  | 1935 program , though in Nebraska it barely carried . Nine states , including four in the Corn Belt , voted negatively with respect to the second question . ' ' A surprising feature of the vote was the large affirmative majorities rolled up in the minor corn-hog producing states . Apparently the " marginal " corn-hog producing areas , those areas with the least " comparative advantage , " lived up to theoretical expectations . Farmers in these regions felt that the benefits of the 1934 corn-hog contracts were quite sufficient to compensate them for reducing their hog enterprise . One important reason was the relation between the corn and hog enterprise and the relative size of corn and hog benefit payments . In minor producing areas many contracts called for a reduction in hog numbers only . At the same time the payments for hog reduction were relatively more attractive than corn reduction payments . Another reason for the affirmative vote in many areas was the " drought insurance " features of the program . Benefit payments constituted the principal source of cash income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative vote on the first question was due to the adjustment difficulties ( in some counties few if any benefit payment checks had been received at the time the referendum was held ) ; to partisan or farm organization politics ; to the opposition of the city press ; and to a feeling that no control measures were necessary in 1935 because of she effects of the 1934 drought . An underlying reason was that at the time of the referendum many farmers felt that they were losing more because of the price depressing effect of the processing tax on hogs than they regained from benefit pay-Footnote  | ments . This feeling disappeared in large measure when hog prices advanced greatly early in 1935 ? It is sometimes contended that the large negative vote expressed the resentment of many farmers , if not a large proportion of them , against government " interference . " This seems doubtful . The same kind of " interference " accompanied other commodity programs which farmers supported by margins ranging from 8 to I to 37 to I. THE 1935 CORN-HOG PROGRAM Taking the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn-hog producers , at least with respect to 1935 , the Corn-Hog Section outlined a tentative plan as quickly as possible . It was immediately presented to a representative group of state and county committeemen , extension specialists , and county agents . This group , from 18 states in all , had been called to Washington to assist in the development of both the program and the administrative procedure . The plan proposed by the Corn-Hog Section was less complex than the group had expected . This took the wind out of the sails of those who had come to Washington prepared to encounter difficulty in convincing the AAA of the need for , and possibility of , simplifying and liberalizing both contract and administrative procedure . Many of the important features of the plan came in for prolonged discussion , but no attempt was made by the AAA to force the group to endorse the suggestions of the Corn-Hog Section . When one or more alternatives were possible , the advantages and disadvantages of each were frankly presented to and discussed with the group.12 Footnote  | Eventually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan that finally emerged was similar to that of 1934 in all important respects but one , but differed from it in many minor ways . The one outstanding change was the discontinuance of any attempt to prevent the productive resources released by the reduction in corn and hog production from being used to increase the production of other agricultural products . This meant , first , that the 1935 contract contained no provisions restricting the production of feed crops other than corn , 13 or basic commodities other than corn and hogs . The removal of these provisions greatly simplified the contract and its administration , particularly with respect to compliance , and permitted farmers to replenish depleted reserves , but it was not altogether satisfactory to other commodity sections . The Wheat Section , for example , felt that it would permit an increase in spring wheat production . It meant , second , that no restrictions were placed on the use of land retired from corn production . Indeed , even the designation " contracted acres " was dropped . This likewise simplified compliance but greatly complicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one landlord was involved . This decision was reached only after extended debate both in the Corn-Hog Section and in the " advisory " committee . Those in favor of removing all restrictions pointed out that it would be necessary in any case to make Footnote  | very liberal provisions for the use of the land retired from corn production ; that lack of seed would prevent any undue expansion in the plantings of oats , barley , grain sorghums , and other feed crops ; that compliance would be simplified ; and that opponents of control would be unable to point to the contracted acres as a wasted resource . On the other hand , proponents felt that a definite contracted area had a useful psychological effect on producers ? that if contracted acres were to re  - -  appear in succeeding years , it would be best to continue them through 1935 even if a wide latitude of uses were temporarily permitted ? and , most important of all , that contracted acres provided the simplest and most satisfactory medium for dividing corn rental payments when more than one landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials indicated that specific contracted acres would not be a feature of the proposed " one contract per farm " plan . A number of the members of the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates who had been in close touch with the 1934 corn-hog program ( and other commodity programs ) favored retaining contracted acres and even somewhat restricting their use , feeling that otherwise neither corn production nor total crop production might be significantly reduced.14 Footnote  | Perhaps the most important of the other changes was that the 1935 program required only a io per cent rather than a 25 per cent reduction in hog production from the 1932-33 average and only a to per cent rather than a 20 per cent reduction in corn acreage ( though the latter might be reduced as much as 30 per cent at the option of the producer ) . This change was significant largely in reducing the total amount of benefit payments made to farmers and thereby simplifying the problem of obtaining the necessary revenue . If participation by producers equalled that of 1934 , benefit payments on hogs would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , that there would be a 15 per cent reduction in corn acreage on the part of contract signers rather than a reduction as large as the 24 per cent which contract signers made in 1934 , rental payments on corn would be reduced nearly 30 per cent . Total benefit payments , therefore , would amount to between 150 and 165 million dollars as compared with the 365 million dollars originally estimated as necessary to pay benefits under the 1934 program and the 312 million dollars actually paid . These payments plus necessary administrative expenses could , it was estimated , be financed out of the revenue Footnote  | from processing taxes on corn and hogs at the existing rate ( $2.25 a hundredweight on hogs and 5 cents a bushel on corn ) collected for the year beginning November 1 , 1935 . The hog payment per unit of reduction required was maintained at $15 a head ; the corn payment per bushel of appraised yield15 was increased from 30 to 35 cents . The rate of corn payment was increased , first , in order to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers with a large corn and a small hog enterprise . Many individuals ( particularly landlords ) in these two groups of producers had signed 1934 contracts from " patriotic " rather than financial motives . The rate was increased , second , because corn prices had advanced sharply during the last half of 1934 . ( The average farm price December 15 was 85 cents a bushel . ) Many members of the group and of the Corn-Hog Section felt that even the increase in corn payment would not make the 1935 contract sufficiently attractive to corn growers . This was an additional reason for permitting free use of what otherwise would have been contracted acres . Corn growers and landlords could contract from 10 to 30 per cent of the corn acreage of the farm to the Secretary and then harvest another crop from it which , if not equal to corn in value , would certainly provide considerable additional revenue . A further inducement , not specifically a part of the contract , was that contract signers alone would be eligible to participate in any corn loan program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time that the 1935 corn-hog program was announced no definite assurance Footnote  | could be given that even contract signers would be able to borrow money on the security of stored corn in the fall of 1935 , because the government corporation that had in the past made such loans was due to go out of existence on June 16 , 1935 unless its life were extended by Congress . This uncertainty existed until February 1935 but many producers were not conscious of it . " No radical change was made in the base period used ? for most individuals it remained the 1932-33 average . Specific provisions were made , however , to give local allotment committees authority to recommend that individual producers be allowed a larger production of corn or hogs in 1935 than would have been the case if the 1932-33 average had been strictly adhered to . At the discretion of the county allotment committee and upon approval by the Corn-Hog Section , a 1935 cornhog contract signer was permitted , if he submitted adequate proof that because of unusual circumstances his corn acreage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the base established by applying the ratio of corn land to harvested crop acres in the community , as shown by the 1930 census , to the acreage of crop land in his farming unit from which a cultivated crop had been harvested at least once during the period 1930-34 ( except that in no case could more than 36 per cent of the harvested crop acreage in a farming unit be planted to corn ) . ' No corn rental payments were to be made to producers who took advantage of this ruling . Similarly , allotment committees could recommend that a contract signer be permitted to raise 90 per cent of the number of hogs established*by dividing the estimated corn production on the farm by 30 ( provided , Footnoteb  | however , that such number did not exceed one hog per acre of corn base ) . No hog benefit payments were to be made to producers who took advantage of this provision . During the campaign , considerable difference of opinion arose between county committeemen and the CornHog Section over the application of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were about 8,000 " permitted production " requests . Committeemen felt that the Section was arbitrarily turning down some applicants and at the same time granting others ? by a mechanical application of the " formula " ? permission to raise more corn or hogs than had been asked for . Committeemen felt further that this granting of all the production permissible under the formula was the main reason for turning down some of the requests . This , however , does not seem to have been the case . The Corn-Hog Section paid no attention to the total production granted on the applications it accepted , but in order to accommodate many of the requests originally turned down , the list of " unusual circumstances " constituting bases for requesting permitted production was considerably expanded . ' $ In this matter , as well as in others , committeemen rather generally felt that they did not have the degree of authority they were entitled to and which they claimed had been promised them . The retention of the 1932-33 base meant that a majority of the 1935 contracts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the remainder , new corn or Footnote  | hog bases would have to be established and a detailed procedure for doing so was set up . As in the previous year , this task was again left largely to the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates . The problem of establishing equitable 1932-33 bases for these new applicants was , in some respects , more difficult in 1935 than in 1934 . The procedure used was fundamentally the same as in the previous year but was improved by important refinements based on experience . A detailed procedure ( including a set of half a dozen forms ) was , for example , developed to analyze the evidence submitted to substantiate the new applicants ' hog production claims . Local allotment committees were inclined to grumble about the involved nature of this procedure without realizing that it was largely a systematization of what they had had to do the previous year . There were , however , a few deficiencies in the forms which caused some irritation , largely because of the unavoidable delay involved in calling them to the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result of experience during 1934 , the whole 1935 campaign was carefully planned before even the first stages were initiated . The duties and responsibilities of the Washington office , the 1934 and 1935 state boards of review , and the 1934 and 1935 production control associations were outlined in minute detail ; the preparation and wording of the numerous corn-hog forms were carefully worked out ; and the whole procedure was graphically portrayed on a " flow chart . " 19 A first glance at this chart no doubt caused almost everyone for whose use it was intended , from community committeemen upward , to throw up his hands in despair . But for those with the patience and mental agility to study it through , Footnote  | the flow chart gave a comprehensive picture of the entire series of operations . In practice the charted procedure was not always strictly adhered to , but the early conduct of the 1935 campaign was much more systematic than that of 1934 . The new program was announced on November 15 , 1934.20 Six regional meetings were held December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures . These meetings were primarily for the purpose of instructing those who would later be in charge of the state programs ? state committeemen , extension directors , and district supervisors . Immediately after January 1 , 1935 the campaign got under way with a series of " educational " meetings . The emphasis on this phase varied considerably from state to state . In spite of the fact that many felt that the " educational " phase had not been sufficiently emphasized in 1934 , no great amount of time or energy was devoted to it . The material presented was simple . It pointed out that , without a control program , prospects were that corn production in 1935 would increase and corn prices would consequently be low in the fall of 1935 ; that hog production would then be overdone and get " out of relation to demand " ; and that hog prices would decline " unduly " in 1936 and 1937.21 Footnote  | New corn-hog control associations were organized to handle the major part of the 1935 program . In some cases the directors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These elections were not supposed to have been held until 1935 contract applications had been signed . This was the first of a number of minor departures from the procedure outlined by the AAA . The proportion of 1934 directors re-elected in 1935 varied considerably from county to county , but for the United States as a whole the average was probably more than 8o per cent . Contract application meetings began about the middle of January 1935 . By April 1 , when the contract application sign-up closed , it was estimated that 1 million farmers had applied for 1935 contracts . For 70 to 90 per cent of the applications , the corn and hog bases were the same as those for 1934 . This group of applications was the first to be handled by allotment committees and state boards of review . When the contracts of this group had been cleared , attention was turned to applications for which corn and hog bases had to be established . Such bases had to be set up not only for new signers but also for 1934 signers whose farming unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an undetermined hog base , and so on . Much of the checking work done by the Rental and Benefit Audit Section in 1934 was transferred to the field in 1935 and done in the states by clerks operating under the supervision of the Footnote  | state board of review . It was hoped that this would speed up payment on the 1935 contracts . It did , at least , greatly reduce suspensions of 1935 corn-hog contracts in Washington . Auditing of these contracts in Washington began about the middle of June . Of the first 4,000 audited , not a single one was suspended . In some states , however , from io to 20 per cent of the contracts had to be returned to the counties for correction , and a similar number contained errors which could be corrected in the state offices . During the discussions that preceded the final determination of the 1935 program , considerable thought was given to methods of adjusting the base period production of producers whose claims had been arbitrarily or unfairly cut in 1934 . At the time it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to county allotment committees and that the latter should recommend adjustments on these contracts to the AAA . Actually , most producers who wanted such adjustments filed appeals with the AAA , which , however , based its decisions in part upon the recommendations of the county allotment committees.22 In a few counties , allotment committees did adjust upward several dozen contracts , but their opportunity to make upward adjustment was limited by the fact that a corresponding amount of downward adjustments had to be made in other contracts . Nor did the Corn-Hog Section encourage these changes . It felt that less difficulty would be encountered in maintaining established bases than in attempting to make adjustments . Footnote  | PARTICIPATION BY PRODUCERS On the basis of preliminary estimates of producer participation in the 1935 corn-hog program , there was an 11 per cent decline from the previous year in the number of contracts ; a 3 per cent decline in the base corn acreage under contract ; an 8 per cent decline in acreage retired from corn production ; and nearly a 12 per cent decline in the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1935 prove to be approximately correct , contract signers will control less than one-half the corn acreage and less than two-thirds of the hog production of the United States.24 Actual participation will , indeed , be slightly less than that indicated by this preliminary report because some contract applications will not be completed.25 Participation increased in the deep South , and in Nebraska , South Dakota , Colorado , and Oklahoma . The largest absolute decreases occurred in the eastern Corn Belt and in Kansas . The increase in the size of the corn payment and the decrease in the size of the hog payment are reflected in the relative decline in the base corn acreage and the base hog production under contract . For the United States as a whole the decline in the latter was nearly four times as large as in the former . The same change tended to be characteristic of individual states , though there were some exceptions . The average base corn acreage of applicants in 1935 Footnote  | was four acres , or 8 per cent larger than the base corn acreage of 1934 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1935 represents the dropping out of the smaller producers . This tendency was , indeed , even greater than a comparison of the average corn acreage bases for the two years indicates , because of the shift in the geographical location of participants . The number of applicants increased , for example , in the South Central states . The average size of the corn base in this area also increased ; but the corn acreage per farm is lower in this area than in the Corn Belt , and the increase in the number of contracts in this area tended to lower the average corn acreage base of all 1935 contract applicants . This tendency was still more noticeable with respect to hogs . In almost all states the relatively small hog producers who had signed 1934 contracts were the ones who tended to drop out in 1935 . But the large hog producers in the South and in other areas where the number of applicants either increased or declined only a small amount , and who for the most part were the ones who signed up in 1935 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the small Corn Belt producers who dropped out . Moreover , in the East Central states the average number of hogs raised by the 1935 applicants was smaller than the number raised by 1934 contract signers ? indicating an increase in the number of small producers participating in 1935 . The fact that the " hog base went with the farmer " also tended to reduce the average size of the contract signer 's hog base in 1935 . When a 1934 contract signer Footnote  | died , his base went out of existence unless it was transferred to a near relative . Old , long-established producers would tend to have the larger hog bases . Most small producers who dropped out in 1935 did so because the reduced size of the payments did not make it seem worth while to bother with a 1935 contract . But this was not the sole reason for the decline in the number of applicants . Other producers both large and small were dissatisfied with their bases , objected to the " red tape " involved , " could not qualify under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected in " principle " or for farm management reasons to having their farming operations limited by a government contract . On the other hand , the requests for applications by a few producers were turned down by county allotment committees because the producers had violated the terms of their 1934 contracts . On the basis of contract applications , total gross benefit payments will amount to about 186 million dollars ? about 26 million more than the maximum estimate when the program was being formulated . The discrepancy is due in major part to the fact that producers retired over 22 per cent of their corn acreage rather than the 15 per cent originally estimated . Since hog marketings in the 1935-36 marketing year promise to be somewhat less than originally anticipated , the accumulated deficit may amount to 50 million dollars by November 1 , 1936 unless the processing tax rate on corn is increased . Footnote  | BEEF CATTLE ? PROBLEMS AND PROPOSALS In sharp contrast to the numerous and extensive measures undertaken by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration from 1933 to 1935 to increase hog prices and hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to beef cattle . Even this measure was undertaken primarily to relieve drought sufferers and not as a first step in the inauguration of a production control program for cattle . The AAA played an important though by no means an indispensable or unique part in the actual carrying out of this and other drought relief measures simply because it was the government department which was best equipped for the job . The Agricultural Adjustment Act as approved May 12 , 1933 did not include cattle in the list of " basic " agricultural commodities . This agricultural commodity had been removed from the list upon the request of spokesmen for cattle producers . ) Range cattlemen , at least , felt that the " domestic allotment " plan as embodied in the act was " economically unsound.j2 Osten-Footnote  | sibly their attitude was based upon the belief that a reduction program with the concomitant processing tax would decrease consumption and drive consumers to competing commodities such as poultry , eggs , and fish ; that no system of compensatory taxes would prevent this ; and that beef consumption in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to regain its " proper place in the dietary of most of our people . " Actually , two other factors had an important bearing on the stand taken by cattlemen . The first of these was their preoccupation with a program for increasing returns to the cattle industry which they had long advocated . This program included the virtual exclusion , by tariff or prohibition , of imports of beef ( particularly canned beef ) and " competing fats and oils " ( particularly cocoanut oil ) ; an increase in the tariff on hides ; a reduction in the freight rates and other marketing charges ; lower interest rates ; " orderly marketing " ; 3 and advertising to increase consumption . The second factor was that , at the time the bill was being debated , the full effect of the increased supply of cattle had not made itself apparent in the cattle market . Between January 1 , 1928 and January 1 , 1933 the number of cattle on farms had increased by 8 million head or 15 per cent , but Footnote  | cattle marketings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspected cattle slaughter was 15 per cent less than in 1926 , the post-war peak . ( See the chart on page 8. ) 4 During 1932 the average farm price of cattle was nearly three-fourths of " parity " as compared with hog prices less than one-half of parity . Within a few months after the passage of the act the attitude of the cattlemen began to change . During 1933 cattle slaughter increased sharply ? it was 13 per cent greater than in 1932 ? and cattle prices declined until by December they were barely 50 per cent of their " fair exchange value . " By the summer of 1933 , cattlemen were demanding that something be done by the government to aid the industry . Representatives of the AAA met with representative cattle producers in Denver on August 12 , 1933 and explained that , inasmuch as cattle was not a basic commodity , action was necessarily limited to what could be accomplished under the marketing agreement sections of the act . " After an all-day session a resolution was unanimously adopted to the effect that livestock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and a committee of five was appointed by the American National Livestock Association to work with the Secretary of Agriculture and the packers in formulating such an agreement . The processors had for some time been working on a marketing agreement for the meat-packing industry , ' Footnote  | an amended draft of which was made public at a hearing held in Washington on September 8 , 1933 . Both the cattlemen 's committtee and a sub-committee of the National Corn-Hog Committee of Twenty-five suggested a number of amendments to the agreement as submitted . Discussion of these proposed changes continued for some time in Washington and Chicago , until all but two major points of disagreement had been ironed out . These had to do with ( I ) the power of the Secretary of Agriculture to initiate " programs , plans , and policies , " and ( 2 ) the extent to which the Secretary should have access to the books and records of the packing industry . The Administrator of the AAA , who had attended the conferences , finally suggested that a solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewrite the agreement in line with the changes acceptable to all theme conferees . For the next four months practically no progress was made toward this end . The AAA and the packers remained deadlocked because of the insistence on the part of the AAA that the agreement be a " reform " measure and the insistence on the part of the packers that they would give no access to books and records if the agreement were of this character ? or indeed under any circumstances . ' The issue was further confused because the officials of the AAA were by no means in agreement among themselves on the matter . One group felt that it should be a strong " reform " measure , another that it should be a strongly protective measure of the NRA type as was the original draft submitted by the packers , and still a third was doubtful whether any agreement Footnote  | would contribute much to accomplishing the objective of the Adjustment Act ? namely , to raise farm income . Early in February 1934 , in an effort to get action , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements of the AAA with respect to access to books and records . During the course of the year , too , the protective features desired by the industry were considerably modified . Both these changes lessened its appeal to the industry . In this form , moreover , the AAA regarded the marketing agreement as so innocuous , either from the standpoint of " reform " or of increasing livestock prices , as to be hardly worth putting into effect . Consequently , the entire matter was allowed to drop . Just what cattlemen expected to accomplish by means of the marketing agreement is not at all clear . Frequent references were made to the elimination of all " unnecessary , unfair , and inequitable charges , unfair competition , and dumping of surplus commodities . " It seems certain , moreover , that spokesmen for the range cattle industry expected to be able to " control and stabilize " the price of livestock and livestock products . This is in essence the " orderly marketing " theory of price control , to which reference has already been made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them an unexcelled opportunity to reduce what they had long considered excessive costs of distribution . Just how this was to be accomplished was never even roughly outlined but it was stated that " producers had everything to gain and nothing to lose " by experimenting with a packers ' marketing agreement as a means of accomplishing this most desired objective . During the fall and winter of 1933-34 , with prospects poor for early ratification of the packers ' market-  | ing agreement , cattlemen made strenuous efforts to get the government to embark upon an extensive program of beef purchasing for relief needs . In order to help finance these purchases , spokesmen for the cattle industry expressed a willingness to approve the levying of a small compensating tax on cattle . This procedure was advocated because a compensatory tax on beef cattle with the proceeds being used to help finance the cornhog program seemed to be in immediate prospect . ' ' As it turned out , no compensating tax on cattle was levied . Though cattlemen admitted that beef was competitive with pork and that a processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption " to the former , there seemed little or no evidence to indicate that such shifts would result in disadvantages in competition to processors ; and in order to levy a compensatory tax it was necessary to show that such disadvantages to processors ( not to producers ) existed . Some relief purchases of beef were made , however . On November Io , 1933 the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation purchased 400,000 pounds of canned beef . In an effort to accomplish the second of its dual objectives , namely to reduce agricultural surpluses ; the FSRC stipulated fat the beef must be from cows between the ages of two and five years . These and other rigid requirements resulted in packers ' bidding on only one-third of the amount upon which bids were requested , and their bid prices were so high that all bids but one for 400,000 pounds were rejected . New bids were requested two Footnote  | weeks later with no age-limit requirement , and other specifications were also liberalized ; but this time all bids were rejected because prices were deemed too high . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 114,260 head of cattle , mostly " canners , " having a total live weight of io6 million pounds . ' ? As with the purchases of live hogs , contracts were let to packers for processing these cattle . Almost exactly 2.5 million dollars was paid for them , or $2.36 per hundredweight . These purchases represented less than 5 per cent of all the cattle and calves slaughtered under federal inspection during January and February 1934 , though they constituted a larger proportion of all the low-grade cattle marketed during the period . During the last quarter of 1933 , cattlemen had become concerned over the record supply of breeding stock that was accumulating on farms , largely because market prices were so low that it did not pay to dispose of it . The industry therefore proposed that steps be taken to reduce the numbers of breeding stock , either by spaying heifers or by disposing of " surplus " she-stock in noncommercial channels . Cattlemen maintained that this would immediately alleviate the situation and that , since " beef cattle are not in serious over-production the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general economic recovery ( and the enactment of legislation to protect the cattle producer from imports of canned beef and vegetable oils ) would make unsound " experiments " in production control unnecessary . The industry felt that these temporary remedial measures could be more easily accomplished if ( i ) cattle were made a basic commodity , Footnote  | and ( 2 ) a large appropriation for these and other purposes obtained from Congress . The cattle industry thus reversed its original stand and gave its qualified support to an amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act introduced in February 1934 designed to make cattle a basic commodity . The lukewarm support accorded the amendment by many cattlemen was , however , due almost entirely to the fact that there was a large accompanying appropriation , and to the belief that since they had been assured that no program would be initiated that was not acceptable to the industry , a production control program could be headed off . These cattlemen remained " unalterably opposed " to a processing tax . To them the corn-hog program was a dismal failure because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least the amount of the tax . Both by direct statement and by implication cattlemen indicated their belief that " relief " for the cattle industry should be financed by direct appropriation.12 Only the occasional cattle producer was willing to admit that it was " rather inconsistent to want to go into the act as a basic commodity and still not have a processing tax . " 18 An appropriation for the relief of the cattle industry was not a part of the earlier House bills to make cattle a basic commodity ( for example H.R. 6133 ) . It was added by those responsible for introducing the legisla-Footnote  | tion in Congress upon representations of the cattlemen 's " lobby . " Great confusion existed as to whether this was to be an outright gift to the industry or to be later repaid by processing taxes . The Secretary of Agriculture in endorsing the proposed bill made it clear that , though the appropriation was necessary " because the production cycle in the cattle industry is much longer than it is for instance , in the hog industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective , " he expected " at least 150 million dollars of this amount would be returned to the Treasury out of future processing taxes . " 14 Cattlemen and their representatives in Congress wanted an outright appropriation but hesitated to say so for fear that too many objections would be raised . Consequently , the matter was never clearly settled ! ' Cattlemen claimed , without a great deal of justification , that they were entitled to a large outright appropriation for five reasons . ( 1 ) Producers of other agricultural commodities had benefited from similar appropriations in the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the National Industrial Recovery Act ( the Bankhead amendment ) . ( 2 ) They had been financially injured by other phases of the recovery program : the cotton program had tripled the cost of cottonseed cake ; the corn loans had doubled the cost of corn and reduced the demand for feeder cattle ; the NRA had raised production costs ; the FERA and PWA had doubled the wage bill ; the corn-hog and corn loan programs had temporarily increased pork supplies and reduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus " was largely due to government activities : government loans on cattle initiated Footnote  | in 1929 had resulted in the holding back of herds that would otherwise have been liquidated so that " those qualified to carry on successfully in the industry must face two handicaps . First they must meet this subsidized competition . Second they must contribute to the funds to subsidize the misfit competitor . " ' ( 4 ) The Administration had failed to take steps to reduce competitive imports . ( 5 ) The Adjustment Administration had penalized the industry by failing to approve the marketing agreement for the meat-packing industry . The proposed amendment became law on April 7 , 1934 . This Jones-Connally Act ( 1 ) made cattle a basic commodity ; ( 2 ) authorized the appropriation of 200 million dollars ( a ) to finance surplus reductions and production adjustments and ( b ) to support and balance ' cattle markets ; and ( 3 ) authorized the appropriation of 50 million dollars to enable the Secretary of Agriculture ( a ) to make advances to the FSRC for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief purposes and ( b ) to eliminate diseased dairy and beef cattle , including cattle suffering from tuberculosis or from Bang 's disease , and to make payments to owners with respect thereto.l ' ' $ Following its usual procedure , the AAA held a preliminary conference with cattle producers as the first step in the development of a commodity program . At this meeting , held at Chicago April 26 , 1934 , the Adjustment Administration discussed the cattle situation and suggested that a representative group of cattle pro-Footnote  | ducers be appointed to work with the AAA in the development of a cattle program . The processing tax was as usual the subject of spirited discussion , but " despite attempts made by others than real cattlemen to pack the meeting . . . with men unfriendly to even exploring the possibilities . . . , producers and feeders finally asserted their rights and . . . voted by a substantial majority to appoint a committee of 25 cattle breeders and feeders to be charged with the responsibility " of co-operating with the AAA in the determination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the AAA represented dairy interests as well as cattle breeders and feeders . ' The inclusion of representatives of the dairy industry was a belated recognition by both cattlemen and dairymen of their mutual interests . During the preceding year beef cattle producers had vigorously opposed attempts made by the dairy interests to curtail production of oleomargarine . Each group was inclined to blame the other for the " surplus " of beef and dairy products , cattlemen claiming that the big increase in cow numbers was due to the dairy industry , and dairymen claiming that beef cattlemen were flooding the market with dairy products.21 During January 1934 , Footnote  | dairy and beef cattle interests had met for the purpose of jointly considering the proposed Jones-Connally amendment and other problems of mutual interest . After a series of conferences a program was outlined which involved ( I ) endorsement of the proposed amendment ; ( 2 ) use of part of the 200 million dollar appropriation to eliminate diseased dairy and beef cattle ; ( 3 ) purchase of beef and dairy products for relief needs ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 5 ) " elimination from production of a sufficient number of beef and dairy cows to give present relief " ; ( 6 ) a processing tax so graduated that its " full burden may be delayed until consumer purchasing power is on the up-grade and returns to producers have reached parity.j22 This program contained no plan for " production control " of cattle numbers and relied heavily on the proposed appropriation for funds . Whether the conferees realized it or not , the last of their recommendations would , if put into effect , have made impossible not only the collection of a supplemental fund of any appreciable size but also the repayment of the original appropriation . Processing taxes on cattle certainly could not be increased after cattle prices reached parity , and it is a debatable question as to just how long the existing rate could be maintained after that point had been reached . Footnote  | This jointly recommended program had been reported as endorsed not only by representatives of the dairy interests and range cattlemen but also by cattle producers in the East and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern cattle raisers , however , seem to have been rather generally in favor of a production control program as well . Corn Belt cattle feeders , at the time , took no unanimous or decided stand . Early in March 1934 an apparently representative group of Iowa cattle feeders and raisers had voted ( though not unanimously ) for a production control program at a meeting sponsored by Iowa beef producers.23 No doubt much of the support given the proposal for production control was due to suggestions that cattle feeders be reimbursed for losses incurred by reason of the corn loan program ; that benefit payments be made to feeders for reducing feeding operations ; and that the levying of a processing tax be delayed until such time as it would not be burdensome on the cattle market.24 A state cattle committee had also been elected , two members of which were appointed by the AAA to the Cattle Committee of Twenty-five when it was set up . About the middle of May 1934 the Committee of Twenty-five submitted the outlines of a proposed program to the AAA . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1937 of 20 per cent in breeding females ; ( 2 ) benefit payments of $4.00 a head on the number of breeding females in the herd during the base period ; ( 3 ) a 5 per cent reduction in feeding operations for the year ending June 30 , 1935 , and a 15 per cent reduction Footnote  | for the year ending June 30 , 1936 ( 4 ) benefit payments of 1.5 cents per pound on the base period feeding operations ; and ( 5 ) a graduated processing tax increasing to a maximum of 50 cents per hundredweight by October I , 1934 . Beef cattle producers and dairy cattle producers were to be equally eligible . A sub-committee of five was selected to remain in Washington to co-operate with the AAA in working out the details . There were at least three difficulties connected with this tentative proposal . The first was financial . Though the total amount of the benefit payments would depend upon the extent of producer participation , it appeared possible that payments would be larger than tax collections to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to balance , of course , because the deficit could be met by drawing on the 20o million dollar appropriation authorized by the Jones-Connally Act . The second difficulty was administrative . The proposal to make benefit payments to cattle feeders would necessitate the determination of the base period purchases of feeder cattle and sales of fat cattle in hundredweights and require a compliance check on the same basis . These difficulties were almost insurmountable . The third difficulty was economic . The proposed plan would not result in any increase in cattle prices for two or three years , and during the first year liquidation of 20 per cent of the breeding females would have a depressing effect on the market.2 " Such a delayed response of livestock prices to a reduction in breeding stock on farms is unavoidable with any variant of the " standard " production control plan , and its immediate depressing influence can only be avoided if the liquidated breeding Footnote  | stock is removed from regular commercial channels . Both the immediate depressing effect and the delayed response are extremely important in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of hogs and practically negligible in the case of annual crops such as wheat . Assuming , for purposes of illustration , that the only factor affecting marketings was a control program involving a 20 per cent reduction in supply , marketings of these three agricultural commodities for the year in which the reduction took place and succeeding years would be as follows ( expressed as percentages of the pre-program level ) : Table A cattle plan calling for a reduction in feeding operations during the initial year would cause some further increase in marketings for slaughter during that year but cause some reduction in marketings in succeeding years . The cattle plan proposed by the committee would , other things being equal , have spread the depressing effect of the liquidation over three years , but by doing so would Footnote  | have delayed for five or six years the full effect of the reduction in production . No steps were taken by either the AAA or the cattle producers ' committee to revise the proposal in order to overcome these objections . Instead , the efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures undertaken to mitigate the effects of the most disastrous drought in the history of the country . One of these measures was the purchase by the government of over 8 million cattle.27 These purchases , together with exceptionally large commercial marketings of cattle , completely reversed the cattle situation . Between January I , 1934 and January i , 1935 the number of cattle on farms declined by 6.6 million head or 11 per cent . Between December 15 , 1934 and April 15 , 1935 the farm price of cattle increased 75 per cent , and on the latter date was practically equal to its " fair exchange value . " As a result , one group in the cattle industry felt that nothing more need be done . As early as July 1934 the American Cattle Producer commented editorially : It appears entirely possible that the drought purchasing program is indeed the cattle program , and that we shall never have to accept a processing tax with its cumbersome accompaniment of contracts to be signed , reductions to be enforced . ... " 28 At the January 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that there was " real danger of production eventually expanding to the point where returns to producers will be unfavorable and a period of liquidation will be necessary . " It also pointed out that there were several possible lines of ac-Footnote  | tion : ( 1 ) inauguration of a production control program within the next year or so ; ( 2 ) doing nothing to restrict production , at least for a year or two until the most desirable level of production became more apparent ; or ( 3 ) concentrating attention on the use of land , control of grazing , and the like . The AAA assured the meeting that it would " continue to follow the policy of being guided by producers in the adoption of an adjustment program . " " But the February 1935 issue of the Producer stated : ... there are a number of sound reasons why no regimentation of the industry should be undertaken . . . . Reasonable credit regulations and sound business management should be able to meet any situation that might develop for many years to come.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of probably a majority of the cattle producers outside of the Western range states . Indeed it did not reflect nearly as accurately as it had a year earlier the attitude of the rank and file of range cattlemen . Cattle producers in the Corn Belt and in the South felt that every effort should be made to develop a concrete plan for consolidating the gains made in 1934 . They were willing to support an amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act that would permit the levying of processing taxes on livestock to pay benefits for reducing feed grain production.31 This amendment was particularly objectionable to members of the Cattle Committee of Twenty-five from the range states , even though they were informed that a program based on such an amendment would have to be approved by the industry if it were to be put into Footnote  | effect . " Instead , they continued to recommend the adoption of a packers ' marketing agreement and an increase in the tariffs on imported fats , oils , and hides . As a result of the opposition of the spokesmen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the AAA discontinued further attempts to obtain constructive co-operation and for the time being practically pigeonholed the entire matter . Footnote  | DROUGHT AND THE.CATTLE PROGRAM About the time the Cattle Committee of Twentyfive was considering plans for a cattle adjustment program , it became apparent that a drought of unusual severity was in the making . One of the most extensive measures undertaken to ameliorate its effects was the purchase by the government in 1934 and early 1935 of over 8 million head of cattle . THE 1934 DROUGHT The 1934 drought was the most serious in the history of the country . It first became critical in an area centering in the Dakotas . Here 1934 appeared as the climax of a " weather cycle , " during which annual precipitation had declined sharply . Between June 1933 and May 1934 rainfall in these states had been barely one-half of normal , and only two-thirds to three-quarters of normal in an area which included most of the Corn Belt . Reserves of moisture in the soil were consequently moderately low to very low . Moreover , the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to May 1934 was one-third to one-half normal in the Corn Belt and from one-quarter to one-third normal in the Dakotas . During May it was from one-quarter to one-third normal in the Corn Belt ( except Kansas ) and less than one-fifth normal in the Dakotas . Lack of rainfall was accompanied by unseasonably high temperatures . By June i the crop situation had become critical in the Dakotas and parts of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Montana , Wyoming , and Nebraska , and serious in a wide area including most of the Corn Belt and extending south through the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas .  | Scattered rains during the first week in June and again during the early part of July did little to alleviate a situation which became progressively worse through the summer and early fall . The drought area widened until it included all or part of every state west of the Mississippi River with the exception of Washington . Only in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota were local rains after June i sufficient to cause material improvement in crop prospects . East of the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Michigan , but was materially relieved in other sections by rains after June I. In fact , southern Indiana and much of eastern and central Ohio harvested one of the best corn crops in years . The general severity of the drought during the spring months first affected small grain , hay , and pasture prospects . The May i crop report placed hay and pasture conditions " substantially lower than on the same date in any of the past 50 years , " and stated that " the need for adequate rainfall is daily becoming more acute " for small grains as well . PLANS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF During the first half of May , officials of three " recovery " organizations ? the Agricultural Adjustment Administration , the Federal Emergency Relief Administration , and the Farm Credit Administration ? watched with growing apprehension the increasing severity of the drought and made tentative plans to cope with its effects . These plans were subject to almost continuous modification as the drought continued unabated . The first public intimation that the Administration intended to take extraordinary steps to alleviate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 14 . These reports indicated that the President , after con-  | ferring with the chiefs of the AAA , the FCA , and the FERA , proposed : ( 1 ) large purchases of beef cattle from farmers in the drought area ; ( 2 ) relaxation of adjustment contracts in the drought area to permit additional plantings of forage crops ; ( 3 ) a federal request to the railroads that they further reduce freight rates on cattle and feed in these areas ; and ( 4 ) federal relief funds for increasing the water supply as well as for providing stock feed and seed to needy families . The next day the AAA announced that plans to purchase livestock and relax contract provisions were being formulated . ' These proposals were by no means new . The CornHog Section had been requested more than once to modify the corn-hog contract to permit increased forage crop plantings , and even prior to the middle of May such action had been advocated by the director of the Commodities Division . It had been requested as early as the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was repeated in a telegram sent to Secretary Wallace on May 13 by the agricultural extension directors of Minnesota , South Dakota , North Dakota , and Wisconsin . This " directors ' conference " likewise urged immediate cattle purchases , the release of corn held as security for corn loans , ' and federal aid to obtain seed and feed for maintaining breeding stock . Early in June , about the time the first major modifications were being made in commodity contracts , an expanded program of general drought relief was formulated by the Administration and submitted to Congress by the President ( June 9 ) . In his message the President pointed out that organizations to handle the drought relief ? the AAA , USDA , FCA , and FERA ? were already in existence and that some measures had Footnote  | already been initiated , but that the drought was becoming so serious that a specific appropriation was essential . Congress acted with unusual celerity . The Emergency Appropriation bill for 1935 was amended for the purpose by the Senate Appropriations Committee , at which time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars requested by the President to 450 million . The original sum was replaced on the floor of the Senate , the amendment agreed to by the House , and the bill signed by the President on June 19 , 1934 . Four days later the first 100 million dollars was allocated by executive order . The total was eventually allocated to the several agencies between June 23 and December 1 much as the President had suggested in his message . As of December 1 , 1934 , funds had been allocated as follows ( in thousands of dollars ) : Table Footnote  | An important supplement to these relief measures was the granting by the railroads of reduced rates on feed shipped into the drought area and on livestock shipped out of such areas to pasturage . Local groups , the Interstate Commerce Commission , or the President 's Inter-departmental Transportation Committee could request the railroads to reduce rates for certified drought counties , and the railroads in turn filed " emergency " schedules with the ICC . These rates became almost immediately effective . ' They were in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent of the regular rate on hay , 66 2/3 per cent on whole grain and other livestock feed , and 66 2/3 per cent of the fat cattle rate on federal shipments of drought cattle . ' ORGANIZATION FOR DROUGHT RELIEF A Drought Relief Service was established on May 21 , 1934 to take charge of all the relief work of the AAA and the Department of Agriculture , and to correlate it with the relief activities of the FCA and FERA . The director of the Drought Relief Services headed an emergency relief committee of representatives of various corn-Footnote  | modity sections of the AAA , several bureaus of the USDA , the FCA , and the FERA.7 The director of the , Drought Relief Service and , his immediate assistants devoted most of their attention to the cattle buying program . The FERA made plans to increase the amount of direct and work relief available in drought-stricken areas , and several sections of the AAA collaborated in the preparation of administrative rulings designed to permit increases in forage crops and the pasturing of " contracted " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas within which these relaxations were to be applicable was placed in the hands of a committee consisting of members chosen from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Federal Extension Service . This committee , later called the Area Designation Committee , made its first " certifications " on May 23 , listing 121 " emergency drought " counties in the Dakotas and Minnesota , and 91 " secondary drought " counties in these and adjoining states . Almost daily certifications were made during the next three months . During June and early July the majority of the certifications consisted of secondary drought area counties , but as the drought continued unabated , many of these counties and others not previously certified were added to the primary drought area . ( See the chart on page 198 . ) On October 24 , 1934 , the date of the last certification , 1,187 counties were listed as emergency , and 270 as secondary drought counties ? a total of 1,457 . These counties were located in every state west of the Mississippi River except Washington , and in Wisconsin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these certifications upon the bases of crop conditions in each county as indicated by Footnote  | Figure  | the regular reports of crop correspondents , daily reports of the Weather Bureau , and special reports and recommendations by the federal state statisticians . It was originally contemplated that these certifications would simply indicate what appeared to be from a distance the relative severity of the drought . All agencies involved in the drought relief program were expected to make further investigations to ascertain if these counties did , in fact , need emergency relief . In practice the several drought relief measures became automatically effective as soon as the counties were certified . There was , naturally , always more or less pressure on the committee to certify counties . This was particularly true of " emergency " counties , since cattle purchase operations were almost entirely confined to them . All other special drought relief measures sooner or later applied to both emergency and secondary areas . About the middle of August the administration of drought relief was reorganized by the appointment of the President 's Drought Committee consisting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the FERA , and the Governor of the FCA . The task of co-ordinating the activities of the various agencies engaged in drought relief was placed in the hands of a Livestock-Feed Committee . The activities within the USDA were placed in the hands of a Drought Plans Committee and five sub-committees . ' A livestock purchase committee was placed in charge of the cattle ( and sheep ) purchasing program , though the actual buy-Footnote  | ing was handled by the Commodities Purchase Section of the AAA . The other sub-committees made plans for conserving seed , feed , and forage , and setting up an " information service " to enable buyers and sellers of seed and feed to contact one another and survey the food situation . DROUGHT CATTLE PURCHASES The Drought Relief Service was unusually quick about initiating cattle purchases , which began within two weeks after the plan was approved . In the meantime , a price schedule had been decided upon , forms prepared , co-operative arrangements with the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation and the Bureau of Animal Industry established , details of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with packers for processing the animals fit for human food . The plan provided for the " government " purchase of cattle at prices dependent upon the age and condition of the animals . The total payment per head was divided into benefit payments and purchase payments as ? follows : Table The purchase payment went to the owner and lien holder ( if any ) jointly , and could be and was used to satisfy the claims of the mortgage holder . If the claim of the lien holder exceeded the purchase payment , he was required to relinquish all claims to the balance . The benefit payment was the sole property of the producer , and the lien holder specifically waived any claim to it . Government purchases of cattle were largely limited to officially designated " emergency " drought area coun-  | ties . ' This area , incongruously enough , included seven Florida counties in which rains had been so excessive as to result in flooding.10 Cattle were appraised by local committeemen selected by the county relief director ? usually the county agent . The procedure varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle buying campaign progressed . At first committeemen usually visited the farm of the prospective seller and appraised the animals . Later the most common procedure was to have farmers deliver cattle on designated days at designated railroad loading points , and appraisals were made there . This practice materially reduced appraisal expense . In either case the committeemen were accompanied by a temporarily appointed Bureau of Animal Industry inspector who condemned all animals not fit for human consumption.11 These condemned animals had to be disposed of by the owner in a manner approved by the inspector . Usually they were buried . Cattle buying began in the Dakotas and Minnesota about June 4 , 1934 and was not finally discontinued until January 31 , 1935 . Purchases were most extensive during July , August , and September 1934 , and three-quarters of the 8.3 million cattle and calves bought by the government were purchased before October I. ( See the ac-Footnote  | companying chart . ) Great pressure was exerted to increase the scope of buying operations within the drought areas . Figure Immediate action was called for by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to prepare detailed instructions to govern procedure in the field . A field office was established in St. Paul , Minnesota , and state agents and local committeemen were simply instructed to " buy cattle . " Little attempt was made to allocate purchases by states or by days , and local state officials almost seemed to be vying with one another to see who could purchase the largest number of cattle , regardless of the congestion at loading points and slaughtering plants , and regardless of the feed situation of the producer . During June , July , and early August 1934 , cattle were bought so rapidly and so promiscuously that no one had an accurate estimate of the number of head being bought from day to day or of what the total  | commitment of the Adjustment Administration was . Apparently a statement by the Secretary of Agriculture that " no expense should be spared " was interpreted by those in charge to mean " pay no attention to expense " for either administrative costs or cattle payments . When the drought relief activities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cattle Purchase Committee was to curtail purchases until the exact status of the purchase program could be determined . " In some states in which the feed situation did not seem to warrant them , purchases were ordered discontinued entirely . Revised quotas , usually covering a period of from ten days to two weeks , were issued as evidence became available with respect to purchases to date , commitments , available funds , feed supplies , and processing facilities . Shortly after the committee began its duties it found that actual purchases exceeded those reported by about 30,000 head , and a corresponding downward revision in quotas had to be made . The committee made its allocations to states on the basis of the best evidence at hand with respect to available feed supplies . In this respect the special feed survey made in August by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics ( largely in response to requests made by the AAA and financed by it ) was invaluable . A continuous effort was made to impress upon state and county directors the necessity of ( r ) buying cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies were shortest ; and ( 2 ) keeping total payments within the amount allocated . In neither case was the committee entirely successful . Even when state directors were in-Footnote  | formed that the " excess " purchases would not be considered an obligation of the federal government , total payments not infrequently exceeded allocations . During September and October the sum of the committee 's allocations to states was limited by the total amount appropriated for cattle purchases , approximately 1 oo million dollars ? an amount sufficient to purchase about 7.5 million cattle . The average daily purchases authorized contemplated reaching this goal by the middle of November 1934 , at which time the majority of the committee felt that the cattle-buying program should be definitely ended . During the last part of October members of the committee personally visited most of the drought areas and reported as follows . ( 1 ) Considerable numbers of distress cattle were still in farmers ' hands ? many of them old cows which producers hoped to unload on the government at prices far above their value ; others because state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from those producers who had fully demonstrated that their feed supplies were not sufficient to maintain their animals and to give priority to those cases in most acute distress . ( 2 ) A widespread feeling existed that promises to buy more cattle had been made , though in fact no such official commitment had been made . ( 3 ) Farmers , in hopes of selling more cattle , were failing to make every effort to conserve the feed supplies that were available . The majority of the Cattle Purchase Committee therefore reaffirmed their belief that cattle purchases should be terminated but that increased efforts should be made to make larger quantities of feed available , thereby maintaining the largest possible number of foundation stock . The abrupt change to a rational buying policy was  | naturally unpopular in the country . Many state cattle purchase officials had exceeded their authority in promising producers an opportunity to sell all the cattle they desired . When this privilege was suddenly withdrawn , producers did not bother to inquire into the merits of the case before loosing verbal assaults and applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee was recommending a complete cessation of cattle buying . Proponents of a continuation of the program were not disconcerted by the argument that funds appropriated for the purpose were exhausted . Their position was strengthened by the fact that officials of the AAA were by no means in complete agreement on the matter . The chief of the Cattle and Sheep Section was convinced that additional purchases should be made , particularly in the Inter-Mountain region , and the Extension Service was of the same opinion . Under these circumstances , buying operations could not be discontinued . On December 4 it was announcedl4 that the total allotment had been increased to $115,822,000 . It was estimated that this increase of nearly 16 million dollars would permit the purchase of 8.5 million cattle in all . At the time this announcement was made , purchases totalled about 7.3 million head , leaving a balance of 1.2 million still to be purchased . This balance was allocated to the states by the Commodity Purchase Section , largely on the basis of recommendations of the chief of the Cattle and Sheep Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver since Footnote  | the middle of August . The largest quotas in relation to cattle numbers were given to the Inter-Mountain states . As it turned out , the desire of producers in these states to sell cattle had been exaggerated . Early in January a number of these quotas were revised downward and the difference reallocated to Mississippi Valley states which had been clamoring for a reopening of the buying program ever since purchases there had been discontinued . " But actual purchases in these states after the program was reopened were also much less than the apparent " demand " indicated . A typical case was that of southern Iowa . All local authorities and agencies , the Governor , senators , congressmen , the local FERA administrator , and the extension service agreed that additional purchases were essential . Some petitioners claimed 200,000 should be bought . Finally , a reallocation of funds was made to permit the purchase of 6o,000 head . Farmers actually sold only 4,420 head . Producers evidently wished to have this alternate outlet available in case they wanted to take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers because of lack of feed . Footnote  | The extent to which the actual rate of purchases declined after the first of November tends to substantiate the contention of the majority of the Livestock Purchase Committee that purchases should be limited to 7.5 million head and discontinued after November 15 . In spite of the fact that purchases were continued for an additional two and one half months , less than 800,000 additional cattle were bought . It must be admitted , however , that making these additional purchases created good-will out of all proportion to the number of cattle bought . Since practically all the major demands for additional quotas were granted , cattle producers and their spokesmen had little to complain of . The comparatively small increase in purchases that this entailed may have been a small price for the AAA to pay for comparative immunity from political or partisan attack . Of the 8.3 million cattle finally purchased , nearly 25 per cent were bought in Texas and over 20 per cent in the Dakotas . The remainder were purchased in 17 of the other 18 states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " During the first part of the buying period , purchases were heaviest in the Dakotas , but once initiated they were most continuous in Texas . Apparently farmers sold about 40 per cent of their actual inventory at the time of appraisal . ' Almost 18 per cent of the animals purchased were condemned , the proportion ranging from 40 per cent in Oklahoma and 34 per cent Footnote  | in Texas to less than 3 per cent in Kansas , Minnesota , and a number of other states . The proportion of all purchases condemned was also high in New Mexico , Utah , and Louisiana . Condemnation was usually determined by whether or not the animals , if shipped , would survive the journey . During the early stages of the campaign , cattle were being purchased faster than they could be disposed of . This was in part because of the difficulty of co-ordinating immediately the purchasing procedure of the Drought Relief Service and the disposal procedure of the FSRC , and in part because of lack of adequate facilities for killing , chilling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shipped until some time after they were supposed to have been bought . " To alleviate the congestion due to lack of processing facilities , about 1.6 million cattle were shipped by the FSRC to graze on pasture in Eastern and Southern states until they could be slaughtered by or under the direction of the relief organizations in these states . About 1.8 million cattle were turned over to state relief organizations in the drought states . The cattle were slaughtered by commercial packers or utilized for fresh meat or canning projects or for redistribution within the state for rehabilitation purposes . A few thousand cattle were also turned over to the Indian Service for distribution to Indian reservations.20 Footnote  | Between one-half and two-thirds of all the cattle purchased were classified as beef cattle . This was natural , since more than three-fourths of the purchases were made in range areas.21 In any event , drought cattle purchases and commercial marketings in 1934 together reduced dairy cattle and calves by 2.2 million head or 6 per cent and all beef cattle by 5.5 million head or 17 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers for these cattle . The total purchasing expense was somewhat less than 5 million dollars.22 This does not include any of the costs of transporting , holding , grazing , and slaughtering the cattle , or cooking and canning the meat , or storing and distributing the finished product . Nor does it make allowance for the value , if any , of the hides , the property of the FSRC . About 2 million of these are in store , and no plans have been completed for disposing of them . The cattle purchase program was financed by 63.4 million dollars from the 20o million dollar appropriation authorized23 by the Jones-Connally Act and 53.7 million dollars from the 525 million dollar emergency drought relief appropriation . About 2 per cent of the entire amount set aside for cattle purchases was held as a Footnote  | reserve and not allocated to the states , and about 5 per cent was set aside for administrative expenses.24 On the whole , farmers were well satisfied with the schedule of payments . No doubt this was due in part to the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herd , for many of the cattle sold were below average in quality and many were culls . In fact , the opportunity that the program offered farmers to get rid of these low-grade animals was frequently emphasized . It is obvious that $10 or $ r 2 was a liberal payment ( measured by market standards ) for an animal so thin and emaciated that it would not survive the trip to market . There was a wide variation in the way committeemen appraised the cattle purchased . In some counties they paid a flat price regardless of quality . In other counties there was a tendency to appraise them at or near the upper limit of the permissible range in prices , though this was by no means universal . The total payment ( benefit plus purchase ) for drought relief cattle compared favorably with the farm price of cattle during most of the period during which purchases were made . The maximum total payment on cattle two years old and over was $20 per head . The average farm price of cows other than those kept for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average farm price of milk cows in the Western states was about $20 . The maximum total payment on cattle one to two years old and on calves was likewise equal to , or slightly in excess of , the average farm prices Footnote  | for comparable age groups of beef and dairy animals in these states . Ostensibly in order to make it possible to use JonesConnally funds rather than wait until the emergency drought fund became available for purchasing these cattle , a provision was inserted in the Emergency Cattle Agreement binding the producer to co-operate in any subsequent adjustment or reduction program , and the total purchase payment was divided into two parts , the " purchase " payment and the " benefit " payment.2e This provision of the agreement was " heatedly attacked " by those whom the AAA in its rebuttal referred to as " professional critics " as delegating " control of an indl , tstry to a bureaucracy , j27 and as " a deplorable and inexcusable requirement in return for aid extended to those in dire distress.j28 The AAA vigorously defended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be immediately initiated and ( 2 ) if a portion of the payments were to belong solely to the producer and not be subject to the claims of the lien holder . An official statement ran : ... Congress had just adopted an amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act making beef and dairy cattle a basic commodity and had authorized 200 million dollars for use under the provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act in helping bring about adjustments in beef and dairy cattle . We wanted to move immediately . We wanted also to be sure that a portion of the purchase price of cattle would belong to the farmer or rancher , and not he subject to the claims of Footnote  | the mortgage or lien holder . We found we could accomplish this by designating a portion of the price paid as a benefit payment . . . . But benefit payments under the . . . Agricultural Adjustment Act can only be made legally in consideration of an agreement to adjust production . In order to move quickly and use the funds available under the cattle amendment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cattle to the government would co-operate with future general programs pertaining to the adjustment or reduction of production of cattle . In this way only were we able to use Jones-Connally Act funds , and so avoid weeks of terrible delay , with starvation and destruction of many cattle and demoralization of cattle markets that would have ensued if we had to wait for drought relief funds .. . .29 This argument is misleading in at least two respects . First , the Jones-Connally Act specifically provides that the funds which it authorizes may be used ( r ) to remove agricultural surpluses or ( 2 ) to support and balance the market . Either one or both of these provisions could have been invoked to make the use of these funds for cattle purchases legal . In fact , one or the other of these provisions must have been used by the AAA , perhaps without conscious realization of the fact , in order to make the " purchase payment " part of the total payment for cattle . Nothing in the original act or its amendments suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further use of the Jones-Connally appropriation ( or funds derived from processing taxes ) for such " purchase payments . " 3 ? Footnote  | Second , the benefit payment procedure was not the only one that could have been used to give to the producer without recourse by the lien holder part of the total purchase price paid . In fact , a procedure for accomplishing this objective by other means was devised in the case of purchases of sheep and goats : the total payment was divided into two parts , a " service and disposition payment " and a " purchase payment , " and lien holders agreed to waive all claims to the former.31 The primary reason for the inclusion of this controversial provision in the cattle agreement was the unavoidable uncertainty with respect to the eventual outcome of the drought and the cattle-buying program . If the drought had been broken by heavy rains early in June , the necessity of relieving the emergency created by it would have disappeared . If cattle purchases had then been discontinued , the shelved control program or one similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been paid premium prices for cattle sold during the drought were certainly not entitled to further payments for this reduction in their herds ? at least certainly not as large payments as producers who had not even had a chance to sell during the emergency campaign . With no further , or only small additional , payments due them , the former would have had little financial incentive to co-operate . They had already received their benefits . The obligation on the part of the signers of the emergency cattle agreement to co-operate with the govern-Footnote  | ment in any future cattle program expires June 1 , 1936 . It is interesting to speculate on the effect of the precedent that will be established if no further cattle program is initiated prior to this date . " Benefit payments " have been made to producers in return for an agreement on their part to co-operate with any future adjustment program , if , as , and when initiated . If no such program is initiated , relatively minor changes in the method of making benefit payments would result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " domestic allotment " plan . " Benefit payments " would be made on the domestically consumed portion of every farmer 's production , if desired in amounts equivalent to the tariff rate multiplied by that portion . They in turn would agree to co-operate in any adjustment program initiated prior to a given date , but no program would , in fact , be initiated . This logical extension of the precedent established by the cattle purchase program means that the phrase " provide for reduction " in Section 8 ( 1 ) must be interpreted as " lay plans for , but not necessarily carry to fruition , a reduction program " rather than an inflexible " require or obtain a reduction . " The commercial cattle market in 1934 was maintained at much higher levels by the government purchases than would otherwise have been the case . Federally inspected slaughter of cattle and calves in 1934 , excluding government slaughter , was about 16 million head , or about 18 per cent larger than in 1933 , and the largest on record . At least an additional 2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal inspection if no government purchases had been made . Few if any of the 1.3 million cattle condemned would have come to market , and in view of the extremely low market prices that would have prevailed , many of the remaining 6.5  | million would not have been slaughtered under federal inspection ; " but there would have been greater liquidation of cattle from the herds of producers who , due to the support given the market by the government , were able to or decided to hold on . Instead of improving after mid-summer , prices would have declined to a level but slightly above the cost of marketing the poorer grades of cattle , and would have remained there until the liquidation had run its course , in the spring of 1935 ? As it was , the crisis was probably the most serious in the history of the cattle industry ; without the drought purchases it would have been very much worse . Because of the changed cattle situation , marketings will be light for several years if producers behave as they have under similar conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has semi-permanently reduced the carrying capacity of Western ranges and if grazing in national forests and other federally controlled grazing areas is considerably restricted , cattle numbers in these areas may increase relatively slowly . But a considerable part of the increase in all cattle numbers between 1928 and 1934 took pace in the Corn Belt . In this area the cattle enterprise can and probably will stage a comeback relatively rapidly . This will reduce market supplies at the time , and cattle prices will remain relatively high and thereby stimulate further expansion of the cattle " plant . " This tendency will be accelerated if concurrent crop control programs increase pasture and hay production . In this connection it should be noted that the Taylor Grazing Act " may tend to prevent undue expansion of the cattle ( and sheep ) industries in the Western range Footnote  | states in the future . This act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide for the protection , orderly use , and regulation of the public ranges and to create grazing districts with an aggregate area of not more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about 142 million acres in these districts , and an amendment to the act to permit this will probably be passed by the 74th Congress . The Director of Grazing , assisted by local stockmen acting as advisers , issues licenses to graze cattle and sheep on the public land in these districts . It is expected that the cattle licenses to be issued for 1936 and thereafter will permit the maintenance by Western cattlemen of a number of cattle at least as large as the number on hand January 1935 , but that the number of sheep to be grazed will be reduced by 5 per cent in some districts and by as much as 35 per cent in others . Since another 14o million acres of the Western range is located in national forests and parks , the federal government will shortly have control of nearly one-half the 550 million acres of land having an annual rainfall of less than 15 inches . If proper co-operation between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture can be secured ? a condition that has not always obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable degree of control over livestock numbers in the range areas with resulting benefits to the range , the rangemen , and the nation .  | GOVERNMENT LOANS ON STORED CORN Between November 23 , 1933 and May 1 , 1934 nearly 200,000 farmers in ten Corn Belt states borrowed 122 million dollars on the security of 271 million bushels of corn stored and sealed on the borrowers ' farms . Over 98 per cent of these loans were made directly or indirectly by the government through the Commodity Credit Corporation . During 1934 and 1935 , all of these loans were repaid with interest , 99.95 per cent of them by the original borrowers ? a highly satisfactory conclusion to a novel experiment . There have been few occasions when any lending agency , private or public , has obtained repayment of nearly a quarter of a million loans aggregating over 12o million dollars , plus interest , without the loss of a single penny . Similar loans were made in the fall and winter of 1934-3 5 and will be available again in 1935-36 . One outgrowth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the basis of an " ever-normal granary " plan . The corn loan program was initiated primarily to quiet unrest in the Corn Belt and to spike the guns of groups demanding more drastic measures of farm relief . ' It was , however , a relatively simple matter to bring forward rational arguments in support of the move . Corn prices had declined " unduly " following the collapse of the speculative boom in the early summer of 1933 . They were , it was argued , bound to advance again because the Roosevelt Administi " ation was pledged to raise commodity prices in general and agricultural prices in par-Footnote  | ticular , and because corn supplies were to be curtailed in 1934 by a production reduction program . Yet many farmers who were financially unable to hold their corn would be forced to sell at current low prices . Others , though able to hold , might not realize the " advantage " of doing so . Under these conditions , the gains expected from these price-raising efforts would accrue to farsighted speculators who were able to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural buying power , " the prime objective of the Agricultural Adjustment Act . A system of corn loans would both advance the time at which farmers obtained the promised increase in buying power , and increase the amount of it . This kind of " stabilization " operation , in contrast to Federal Farm Board operations , the argument concluded , was bound to be self-liquidating because subsequent supplies of corn were to be controlled . The immediate initiation of these loans was possible because : ( I ) six Corn Belt states already had farm warehousing acts on their statute books ; and ( 2 ) the Commodity Credit Corporation , a federal organization authorized to make such loans , was already in existence . ' Other states quickly passed farm warehousing acts and by January 1 , 1934 producers in parts or all of twelve Mid-West states could borrow money on the security of stored corn . ' Eligible producers4 stored their " merchant-Footnote  | able " corn on the ear in cribs on the farm , had it sealed according to state law , and borrowed 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Credit Corporation , turning over the " warehouse certificate " issued by the state as security . The local lending agency could , in turn , sell the paper secured by these certificates to the Corporation with accrued interest at 4 per cent , which rate of interest producers also paid . In the event that corn prices were less than loan value at maturity date ( August 1 ) , the borrowers were permitted to discharge the obligation to repay the lender by delivery , at local lending points , of the number of bushels of stored corn upon which the loan was obtained . The program was developed jointly by the AAA and the Commodity Credit Corporation , but was conducted entirely by the Corporation . A commitment of 15o million dollars was obtained from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to finance the loans . The Federal Reserve system acted as the fiscal agent of the RFC and held the paper as security for loans to the Commodity Credit Corporation . Disbursements and collections were likewise handled by the Federal Reserve Banks . The inspection and sealing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state authorities as provided by the laws of the respective states . Procedure naturally varied somewhat from state to state , but in most cases some kind of county " warehousing board " appointed sealers and inspectors and issued the certifi-Footnote  | cates.5 At first some confusion existed , especially in Nebraska , because , although the state law prescribed the procedure for sealing corn and issuing certificates , the AAA laid down certain minimum requirements with respect to grade of corn , type of crib , and so forth . Thus in order to be eligible for a " government " loan , the requirements of both the state law and federal government had to be met . ' The expiration date for making loans was originally set at March I , 1934 , but it was twice extended , the second time to May 1 , 1934 . The maturity date , originally set for August 1 , was extended to October 15 , 1934 . A small number of loans were indeed either repaid or converted after that date . Most of the notes were sold by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they were received from producers , since local lending agencies did not care to carry in their portfolios notes whose face value was materially larger than the market value of the collateral . About one-fifth of the notes , however , were held until June 1934 and then sold , the Commodity Credit Corporation having specified that it would not buy any paper after July 1 , 1934 . As a matter of fact , notes for a small amount were accepted after this date due to the necessity of making corrections in the loan paper which had been presented prior to July 1 . The table on page 221 shows the approximate volume of 1933-34 loans made by the Credit Corporation , together with monthly repayments of these advances . Footnote  | During the entire period in which loans were being made the farm price of corn in the major Corn Belt states was 1 o to 15 cents below the loan value . Farmers consequently had everything to gain and nothing to lose Table by taking advantage of this borrowing opportunity . The monetary advantage was most pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually lower than elsewhere because of the distance from the " deficit " corn areas . The policy of making loans at a 45-cent rate re-  | gardless of location was largely dictated by the necessity of simplicity in the interest of speedy inauguration of the loans . A rate based on the usual differentials between areas was contemplated first , but this would have necessitated establishing differential loan rates by counties or other small geographical areas and thus have materially complicated and delayed the program . No doubt at least three other considerations had some influence : ( 1 ) a flat rate made the offer most attractive in the " hotbed " of the farm unrest ; ( 2 ) to the casual observer the rate seemed less out of line with market prices than was actually the case ; ( 3 ) a rate of 45 cents on the farm was roughly equivalent to two-thirds of the parity price , which was the same relation that the cotton loan rate bore to parity prices for cotton . ' The loan value actually initiated was a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans on a Chicago basis . ' This was particularly true for the western Corn Belt . The initial proposal would have meant loans in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska at a rate i o to 15 cents lower than in north central Illinois and 15 to 20 cents lower than the rate finally fixed . It seems safe to conclude that the rates suggested in these first proposals were at least as high as Footnote  | seemed " safe . " They were not , however , high enough to satisfy producers and quiet farm unrest ? in fact quite the reverse . To do this it was necessary to establish a loan rate from 20 to 8o per cent higher than a reasonable analysis of the situation seemed to justify . But the possible acquisition by the government of a considerable quantity of corn was a bridge that did not have to be crossed at the outset . On the other hand , the demand for a liberal corn loan was real and pressing . In the meantime , anything might happen ? and most of it did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars on sealed corn . Nearly one-half of this amount was loaned in Iowa , almost exactly one-quarter in Illinois , and not far from one-fifth in Nebraska . Less than 10 per cent of the total was loaned in the remaining seven states . The tabulation on page 224 shows the approximate amount loaned and the number of bushels pledged as security therefor , by states . ' Loans tended to be concentrated in the cash corn areas of the several states . Thus a large proportion of the loans made in Iowa were made in the western , especially in the northwestern , part of the state . This area normally sells onequarter to one-third of its annual corn crop for cash . The 1933-34 corn loan program was efficiently and effectively administered . Farmers were able to borrow money very shortly after the original broad outlines of the program were announced . The duties and responsibilities of the several federal and state agencies were carefully delimited and co-ordinated . The pledged corn Footnote  | was reasonably carefully inspected and sealed . In many states , particularly Iowa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operate in the plan and expedite loans . Local bankers , after momentary hesitation , made their facilities available to borrowers , so that producers were able to obtain the full face value of the note almost immediately . Table The cost to the borrower was likewise reasonable . Sealing , inspection , and filing expenses ( all representing state charges ) paid by the producer at the time he sealed the corn amounted to slightly less than 1.5 million dollars , or slightly more than one-half cent a bushel . The interest and insurance charges amounted to nearly 2.75 million dollars , or about i cent a bushel . ? The total cost was thus about 1.5 cents a bushel , or 3.4 per cent of the face value of the note during the time the money was borrowed ? on the average about six months . If the average had been one year the cost would have been about 5.6 per cent since state inspection , sealing , and fil-Footnote  | ing charges were fixed regardless of the length of time the loan was in effect . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . The Commodity Credit Corporation paid the RFC slightly more than 1.75 million dollars interest , 12 and was in turn paid over 2.3 million dollars by producer borrowers . Deduction of direct and allocated administration expenses amounting to $ I oo , 000 left an operating gain of slightly under half a million dollars to the Corporation.l3 The least satisfactory part of the 1933-34 loan was the provision , or rather the lack of provision , for releasing the sealed corn for sale so that the loan could be repaid from the proceeds.14 Early in June 1934 , producers were given permission to obtain partial release of their corn , " solely for feeding purposes , " by paying the lending agency at the rate of 47 cents a bushel for the amount released . The lending agency then notified the official sealer or inspector who broke the seal , supervised the removal of corn on which the loan had been repaid , and resealed the remainder . But still the producer had to pay off this part of the loan before the corn was released . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan agencies to consent to the sale of the corn on behalf of the Credit Corporation and the RFC . Upon receipt of the name of the prospective purchaser and the price , the agency manager had authority Footnote  | to consent to the sale , and upon such consent was required to advise the purchaser and sealer or inspector . The purchaser and producer were held jointly liable for the repayment of the loan from the sales proceeds . However , in many cases in which the corn had to be sold in order to repay the loan , the borrower simply broke the seal , sold the corn , and then paid off the loan . Since the corn was still covered by the lien , the purchaser would have been liable if the note had not been paid . Only a few cases of this kind were reported , principally because borrowers still had a substantial equity in the corn . In many ways the 1933-34 corn loan was as unconventional an experiment as any so far devised . Certainly it contained elements that under less propitious circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . Judged by commonly accepted standards of soundness , the risks assumed were enormous . The 271 million bushels of corn put up as collateral for the 12o million dollars borrowed was " appraised " by state sealers or inspectors about whom the lender knew little or nothing , and stored in 200,000 places scattered over ten states ? frequently in wire cribs having no floors and only makeshift roofs . Even the financial responsibility of the 190,000 borrowers was unknown . Furthermore , a loan rate materially higher than the market at the time the loans were made , and materially higher than future prospects appeared to warrant , must be considered as an unavoidable concession to the exigencies then existing , rather than a procedure which can be indulged in with impunity in the future . One danger was the possibility of collusion between the borrower and local sealer or inspector , particularly as the latter was not responsible to either the original lender or the Commodity Credit Corporation . All the  | evidence indicates that there were few if any cases of this kind , a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrequently political , appointees . A second danger , since the collateral remained in the backyards of the borrowers rather than in the hands of the lender or a bonded and responsible intermediary , was that the sealed corn would be illegally fed , sold , or otherwise converted . This hazard appeared tremendous ; yet it became an actuality with less than one-fifth of 1 per cent of the borrowers . In most of these cases the corn had been either illegally converted or destroyed by fire , the latter apparently of incendiary origin . Moreover , the Corporation was able to get repayment in full from 8o per cent of these borrowers , thus leaving an almost negligible amount to be recouped from the insurance companies . The latter made handsome profits on insuring the 1933-34 loans , but as a result of the experience were induced to reduce the initial rate of 4.5 cents per $10o to 3.5 cents on July 1 , 1934 . Primarily responsible for the exceedingly satisfactory outcome of the 1933-34 corn loan was the 1934 drought . Just when it appeared extremely probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the corn on which loans had been made , grain prices began to advance rapidly as lack of moisture and unseasonably high temperatures began to take their toll of the crops . Corn prices increased sharply in July , and by the middle of that month the Iowa farm price had reached the loan value . A small additional advance occurred in July and a 16-cent jump in August . Repayments which had amounted to less than half a million dollars from December 1933 through May 1934 jumped to over 37 million dollars in August . Not all the released corn was sold at the prevailing market  | prices , however . A not inconsiderable portion was fed to livestock on the sealers ' farms . If weather conditions had been normal in 1934 it seems almost certain that only a small portion of the loans would have been repaid . If pastures , hay crops , and small grain production had been normal there would have been little occasion to fall back on the sealed corn during the summer . Average yields of the 95 million acres planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn supply in view of the unexpectedly large reduction in the spring pig crop of 1934 , partly as a result of the 1934 corn-hog reduction program , and partly due to an unusually unfavorable corn-hog ratio the previous year . No plan for dealing with such an eventuality had been completed when the drought and ensuing advance in corn prices made one unnecessary . It was the intention to develop , if possible , a method of holding this " government " corn on farms by one means or another and to use it to pay farmers for reducing production in 1935 . Perhaps the least of the difficulties this would have raised would have been the necessity of obtaining an amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act authorizing rental and benefit payments " in kind . " 15 Though the situation was concurrently affected by a whole series of conflicting influences , the 1933-34 corn loan seems to have had at least five short-run or immediate effects . ( 1 ) Marketings of corn were reduced , thereby supporting the market and increasing returns to those holders of corn who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of corn fed to livestock during the winter , spring , and early summer of 1933-34 was reduced , Footnote  | thereby making available a greater supply when , as events turned out , the need for it was acute . " ( 3 ) Hog marketings were increased and hog prices depressed during the early part of the marketing year . The effect of the corn loans on the hog market was probably not very great , since the corn-hog ratio was extremely unfavorable to hog feeding even prior to the initiation of the loans . This in itself has , in the past , resulted in earlier than usual marketings and lighter than usual weights . Cattle marketings and cattle prices tended to be similarly affected , though again the effect was probably not very great . ( 4 ) The program adversely affected the " profits " of livestock feeders and dairymen , especially those who had to buy corn . Cattle feeders indeed felt that they were entitled to recoup these losses from the government.17 ( 5 ) The 1933-34 corn loan caused a not inconsiderable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation , " both because the loan rate was higher than the market price and because at least some of the corn placed under seal would not have been sold.18 In many rural communities the stimulus to local business activity was marked . Producers used the proceeds of these loans to pay taxes and old debts , and to buy clothing , farm equipment , and even radios and other " luxuries . " This increase in agricultural buying tended to react favorably on industry and to promote " general economic recovery . " The net effects of the 1933-34 corn loan as contrasted with its immediate influences are more obscure . It seems Footnote  | certain , however , that farmers who took advantage of the loans , much less all farmers as a group , did not realize a net gain of nearly 83 million dollars as officially reported by the AAA.19 This amount represented the difference between loan values plus the cost of the loans and the market ( not the farm ) value of the sealed corn the month it was released . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to livestock on the borrower 's farm . In the great majority of cases this livestock when sold failed to " pay " for the corn fed at current market prices . In the second place , a great deal of the released corn was sold to other producers so that gains to the sealing producers were offset by losses to the buyers when they in turn sold the livestock to which the corn had been fed . On the other hand , to limit the net gain to agriculture to that obtained from sales of released corn to non-agricultural users is likewise too simple a solution . Agriculture certainly profited by the fact that the loans tended to hold corn in producing areas where it was later needed , thus saving an appreciable amount in freight and handling charges . This saving was probably split between buyers and sellers . Both agriculture and the nation gained by the fact that the corn saved during the fall and winter of 1933-34 enabled the maintenance of a somewhat larger supply of foundation stock on farms , especially in drought areas , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat higher during the summer and fall of 1934 than they would have been if this additional livestock had been liquidated . Footnote  | One obvious outgrowth of the operation of the 1933-34 corn loan was its re-inauguration with minor changes in the fall of 1934.21 The 1934-35 loan rate was increased to 55 cents , and a borrower was required to take out primary insurance , which he could obtain at 75 cents per $100,22 covering not only the loan value of his corn but also his own equity in it . The new loans matured on June 30 , 1935 . This date was adopted because the Commodity Credit Corporation felt that it would be to the advantage of both the producer and the Corporation to liquidate loans before corn prices began to reflect the influence of the 1935 small grain and corn crops . In view of the decrease in the number of livestock on farms , normal weather conditions would almost certainly mean much lower feed prices . There was a striking distinction between the 1933-34 and 1934-35 loans in the relation that the loan rates bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the new loans were announced , and May 1935 , corn prices in Iowa ranged from 70 to 90 cents a bushel compared to the loan rate of S5 cents . Moreover , the 1934 corn crop was extremely short . Consequently , only about 20 million bushels23 were placed under seal during 1934-35 as compared to 271 million bushels the previous winter . Furthermore , Footnote  | local lenders held about two-thirds of the producers ' notes and the Commodity Credit Corporation only onethird . As a result of the experience gained during the operation of the first loan , a number of improvements were made in the 1934 loan procedure . The insurance coverage required of borrowers was increased . Crib requirements were made more rigid . Many state warehouse laws were amended to conform to common standards . More care was taken in periodically inspecting sealed cribs , and a definite procedure was laid down for permitting borrowers to dispose of the corn in order to retire the loan on it . The 1934-35 loan rate bore a more " reasonable " relation to existing and prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes had to be paid long before the 1935 corn crop was made . Even if producers had turned down a control program for 1935 ( see Chapter VIII ) and greatly increased acreages planted to corn , prices promised to remain at relatively high levels until the new crop or small grain substitutes became available in volume . As a result of the favorable reaction of producers to the 1933-34 loan and in order to increase the attractiveness of the 1935 corn-hog adjustment contract , the AAA had announced in the fall of 1934 that every effort would be made to provide for loans on the 1935 corn crop . No definite promise could be made at the time since the charters of the RFC and the Commodity Credit Corporation were due to expire early in 1935 . Either these charters would have to be extended or another method of making loans would have to be devised . On January 30 , 1934 the AAA definitely announced that contract signers would be able in the fall of 1935 to  | borrow on stored corn.24 Shortly thereafter , Congress extended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Commodity Credit Corporation to April 1 , 1937 , thus making it possible for the latter to undertake such loans . The loan rate , it was pointed out , would not and could not be determined " until later in the season when the essential facts have developed in regard to probable production and feed requirements . " This can be interpreted either as indicating a decision to set loan rates in line with existing and immediately prospective market values or as merely leaving the matter open . If loans are to be made at rates in line with market values they promise to be attractive only to producers wishing to finance feeding operations and to those desiring for one reason or another to hold their corn till toward the end of the marketing season . Now that private lending agencies have had a demonstration of the practicability of making loans on sealed corn at rates in line with market values , they should be willing and able to take care of most demands of this kind . If the matter is merely being left open , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of line with market values as a step in the inauguration of an " ever-normal granary . " Government loans on stored grain have been suggested as the basis for developing , in conjunction with production adjustment , a far-reaching scheme for stabilizing agricultural production in line with " effective demand , " for guarding against short crops , and for protecting the consumer against food shortage . " It has been stated that the corn loan program of the AAA was the first step in the inauguration of this " ever-normal gran-Footnote  | ary " scheme.26 No detailed plan for initiating this scheme on a comprehensive scale has yet been announced , but the proposition would appear to involve the following : ( I ) a carry-over at the end of the crop year larger , perhaps several times larger , than has been customary in the past ; ( 2 ) the carry-over to be held on farms , but financed directly or indirectly by " government " loans ; ( 3 ) provision for making payments in kind to co-operating producers so that they could be paid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to year adjustments in corn plantings based upon prospective demand and the size of the carry-over . Thus following years in which corn production had been large due to exceptional weather , acreage planted would be readjusted downward so that with average yields the supply ( new crop plus carry-over ) would again be " normal . " In years in which production was below average , the carry-over could be drawn upon and replaced the succeeding year by permitting an increase in plantings . The first difficulty in carrying out such a program would be that of annually forecasting with a sufficient degree of accuracy , first , the optimum volume of corn Footnote  | consumption and , second , the price necessary to bring this about . Some account would have to be taken of , or some control exercised over , the production of substitute feeds , including hay and even food grains such as wheat and rye . Wide margins of error in the forecasts would be unavoidable . Even if the forecasting problem could be solved , it seems quite impracticable to attempt any exact control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to control the number of acres planted to corn , an average carry-over of 500 million bushels of corn would be required and in individual years might involve carrying over z billion bushels.27 The most that can be expected , therefore , is that the more extreme fluctuations in the annual supply could be removed . To the extent that corn prices were stabilized , the annual value of the corn crop would be destabilized . This is a serious objection , even though most corn is not sold for cash but fed to livestock . In the marketing year following a large crop , producers would have the " normal " corn supply to feed and an additional cash income from borrowings on the stored corn and from benefit payments . In marketing years following short crops they would have to use the cash benefit payments to repay corn loans , or to accept payments in kind , in order to obtain even a " normal " supply of feed . The making of benefit payments in kind would be difficult and cumbersome to administer . The stored corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the demand for payments in kind , if any choice in the matter were to be offered producers , would perhaps be largest in " deficit " areas . Perhaps the most serious difficulty in carrying out Footnote
