TRANS-FLUMEN NOTE : In Brooklyn 's new Municipal Building , it is the local elevators that carry you haltingly to the marriage-licence bureau , it is the express elevators that spend you to a divorce . AN admirer , who signs herself Peg , has sent us a fine X-ray picture of her upper left molar ? " with best wishes . " She 's a pretty little thing , except for those two cavities . OUR leisure class , according to the genial Mr. Morgan , includes all who can afford a maid . He believes that if this class were destroyed , civilization would die ( which would be a big loss to the maids ) . He says the only way a woman finds time to he civilized and educate her children is by letting somebody else do the work . This class theory of civilization is neat enough till you start linking around at some of the leisurely women and at some of the busy maids . So often , nowadays , when one is admitted to a house , he finds the maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person than the lad ) who offers him a drink in the living-room . Drop into a bar at six o'clock and you find on the high stools leisure-laden ladies who are so highly civilized they know all the literary tipple of the moment , all the drama doings , all that is new and best in music and art , and they are talking it just as fast as sound can flow from lips ; yet the effect , somehow , is barbarous . They arc like thoroughbred horses whose veins are so poppy they tremble all over . They could use some household routine , to cool off the hot little brows , to drain the quick little thoughts into channels . WE ourself are , by Mr. Morgan 's definition , a member of the leisure class , in that we employ a maid ; and the fallacy of his theory , as it works out in our house , is that the maid herself has a family of three children whom she is supporting by providing us with leisure so that we can be civilized . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society is easily as great as ours , yet the chances of having a maid of her own are exceedingly slight . Luckily , she was born civilized , as some people are , and that is where Mr. M. 's theory topples . This thing called civilization is more mysterious than he suggests . NVe know ladies who , with six maids to ease their labor , are still hums . We know other ladies so civilized that not even the somewhat decivilizing task of " running servants " can rot their character . People become civilized , we take it , less because of certain privileges of leisure than because of certain enzymes and allergies , or because their parents once ate a sugar bun that happened to he full of phosphorus . VANITY FAIR used to publish a feature called " Impossible Interviews . " The interviews never seemed impossible to us , at all . They seemed almost probable . The other night , when Bing Crosby interviewed Leopold Stokowski over NBC on the Kraft Cheese hour , we knew that Vanity Fair had been living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is . THE day the King died , the Daily Worker carried the headline : " BRITISH PRESS CROWS MAUDLIN AS ROYAL PARASITE 'S LIFE WANES . " We are no champion of monarchy , but we 've seen the newsreels of the funeral procession , and although King George may have seemed parasitical to the enlightened idealists of America , we were terribly impressed with how structurally vital he seemed to the dark empire across the sea . We found ourself wishing we had a king , to live and die for us , and leave an heir who would also wear fancy clothes and march in the rain . The advantage of a king over a president is that one reveres a king with a silly , childish attachment that one has for an old family piece ; a president one reveres , if at all , only as long as his policy suits the taste  --  which is seldom four years , and at the most eight .

The Daily News sent its inquiring reporter out to stop people and ask ; Bernard Shaw gave his pronouncement on the subject ; and the other day a woman who lives on Delancey Street in Philadelphia wrote to WOR making a tangible suggestion , which expresses the heart of America . " Yes , the new King Edward VIII should marry , " she wrote . " It would make his subjects so happy and the girl should be none other than Greta Garbo , With her beside him he would rule the world . What a king and what a queen ! As you probably know , Garbo has blue blood in her ancestry , far back . It would he like a dream if something like this would happen . Both have had a rough time with love . " It would he like a dream , indeed . It would he the greatest thing since Lindbergh 's flight .

For purposes of interoffice communication , the Line has adopted , for the Queen Mary , the code designation MA . Obliging AN out-of-town young lady who came on to visit some cousins last week plunged right into the seamier side of New York life by trying to go some place on a Fourteenth Street crosstown trolley . She was standing on a corner ? she does n't remember which one  --  where a cop had told her she could catch a car , but she had no luck at all . Three cars went right by , in spite of her signal . The fourth one stopped . She got in and asked the motorman why the others had n't stopped . " They were trying to catch the lights , " he explained indulgently . Then he added , " I just stopped for the accommodation . " Salesmanship OUR automobile was in the lineup waiting for the ferry . The river looked gray and choppy , and it was bitterly cold . A small , cold man came up with a kit of some sort in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , speaking loudly , so we could hear him through the window , " the windshield-cleaner without an equal . " He dug into the kit and produced a bottle . " A few drops will make your windshield immune to rain or fog , sleet or snow , ice or ordinary dust . I 'll show you how it works . " He delved again into his bag , and began making marks all over our windshield with what looked like a piece of soap . We lowered our window and said " Hey ! , " but it was too late . He held up a hand to silence our protests , and declaimed , " Now we 'll see the remover at work . " He took an atomizer from his kit and thoroughly sprayed the glass . Then he started to polish the mess with a rag , continuing his sales talk as he worked . Suddenly the talk stopped . He quit polishing , looked narrowly at the windshield , and attacked it again , scrubbing twice as hard as before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , " he said , " the damn stuff 's frozen again ! " Burks of the Pulps AS if in a trance , we found ourself in a suite in the Hotel Knickerbocker talking with an ace pulp writer . A pulp writer is one who writes for those numerous magazines printed on unfinished paper ( Horror Stories , Detective Tales , Livid Tales , Ace Sports , and whatnot ) . The writer we were talking with was a Mr. Arthur j . Burks . " And is it true , " we were saying , " that you write a million and a half words a year ? " " Of course , " Mr. Burks said , adding with contempt , " A million and a half is so usual . Lots of pulp writers do more than that . " Mr. Burks , it seems , is n't the most prolific pulp writer around , but the most versatile ; turns out with equal facility stuff classifiable , he said , as " detective , animal , Western , mystery , fantastic , terror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused for breath . " And weird , " he added . He estimates he has written about twelve hundred stories , for a hundred and forty magazines , since he sold his first one , in 1924 . Examining the current pulps on a newsstand , you 'd find about a dozen of his stories , under his own name or one of his pseudonyms : Estil Critchfield , Burke MacArthur , Lieutenant Frank Johnson , Lieutenant Scott Morgan , Spencer Whitney . He 's proud of his work , too . " I do n't feel like apologizing for writing to an audience of twenty-five million people , " he says . Mr. Burks is thirty-eight , heavy-set , and black-haired . He lives at the Knickerbocker with his wife and an old Un derwood typewriter , moving them both into Connecticut for the summer . Mrs. Burks acts as his literary agent , and you can imagine that she keeps busy , too . Mr. Burks was a Marine from 1917 to 1927 , rising from private to lieutenant , and spending an unforgettable time as aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook , " Walter Garvin in Mexico . " General Butler told Lieutenant Burks the story in two hours , and Burks wrote it in two weeks . " Understand , it was n't lousy writing , either , " he told us . We asked how he had made out financially since he had left the Marines for writing , and he said , " A pulp writer who ca n't make four hundred a week is n't worth his salt . " He does n't read many other pulp writers ; prefers Hemingway and Faulkner and ( in translation ) Gautier and Anatole France . We asked Mr. Burks ' opinion of Arnold Bennett , whom we have always considered pretty prolific . " Damned lazy , " said flr . Burks . Average daily output of the Burks Underwood is four thousand words . In emergencies Burks can do three or four times this amount . Once , for example , Sky Fighters called him at ten in the morning and ordered three stories , a total of some twelve thousand words . It got them by six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty dollars for his day 's work . He never rereads his writings , either in manuscript or after they are published , and does n't care what editors do to them . His challenge is that he can get an idea for a story from any word , object , or person . ? Ve tried him out on in lampshade in the room . " It 's the shape of a coolie hat , " he said , " and there 's a little nick that looks like a bullet hole . . " " All right , " we said , handing him an ashtray . " Reminds me of a machine-gun part , " he said . " I 'll just put a crew of three men in No Man 's Land ... " We pointed at a picture in a gold oval frame . " A wound of that shape with a gold edge around it , " he muttered . " By George , " he said suddenly , slipping a piece of paper into his typewriter . " THE GOLD Kiss , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched . " The body was half in and half out of the shadow cast by a huge samovar . The detective stooped over the corpse and gasped in amazement . The gaping oval wound had not bled at all . More than that , it was surrounded by a thin film of what , at first glance , looked to be gold dust . . . " As we tiptoed away , we heard the hum of the Underwood rise in a fierce , white-hot crescendo . Purchase n UR correspondents keep us pretty 1.  - -  1 well posted on the saga of Ewell stein in America  --  as pretty and incredible a collection of tales as you 'd wish to hear . The latest one opens with a telephone call to Dr. Abraham Flexner , head of the Institute for Advanced Study , where Einstein carries on at Princeton . " Have you got a man named Einstein working for you ? " asked the voice . " Yes , " said Dr. Flexner . " Who wants to know ? " Well , it turned out to he the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesmen had called on Dr. Einstein and signed him up for an installation in the modest house he occupies in Princeton . The company wanted to find out if Mr. Einstein 's credit was good . Dr. Flexner thought fast ; said it was all a mistake , and that the order was to be cancelled . Then he went straight to Einstein and told him never , never to listen to American salesmen . The ittle mathematician amiably agreed to have all his purchases 0 . by Dr. Flexner . Criticism YOU have heard of play- ' wrights who like to mingle with crowds in theatre lobbies during intermissions , picking up at first hand the reactions of their audiences . In our opinion , no good can come of this . For example , Mr. Maxwell Anderson , the distinguished author of " Winterset , " would probably have just been upset if he had been in the lobby of the Martin Beck last Saturday evening , and had overheard the pretty little wench who remarked to her escort , " They say this is written entirely in prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ex-WE 'VE Street , in the Bronx , to call on the Goldbergs  --  J. Goldberg , Sr. , and J. Goldberg , Jr. ? and two more resourceful gentlemen you never met . They own a firm that can , and does , get rid of anything , not by giving it away but by selling it . For instance , the National Surplus Company ( that 's the name of the Goldbcrgs ' firm ) heard recently  --  their ears are always to the ground  --  that a shoe factory in Massachusetts had on hand 30,000 pairs of those old-fashioned button shoes for ladies , had had them on hand for years and years . Well , the Gold-bergs bought them up instantly , all 30,000 pairs , at ten cents the pair . You and I would have been stuck with 30,000 pairs of ladies ' button shoes , but not so the J. Goldbergs . They sold them to Amtorg , the Soviet trading company , for thirty cents a pair , after they had cut one pair down to make a sample pair of two-button Oxfords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lot . The younger Goldberg was modest about this achievement . " That was nothing , " he said . " You should have seen the warehouse full of wet sugar we got rid of . This warehouse was on the Mississippi and the sugar got wet in a flood . So we bought it , cheap . On account of the mud in the river water , the government would n't let us reclaim the sugar for human use . So we sold it to apiarists in Wyoming and Idaho , fur bee food . " We were impressed . The Goldberg saga ran on . There was the case of the freezing plants used in making T.N.T . during the war . The Goldbergs bought them from the government and sold them to the Southern Pacific for ice plants ; they 're set up along the desert stretches of the railroad for the replenishing of refrigerated fruit trains . The government would never have figured out what to do with the things , but it was easy for the Gold-bergs . They keep in touch with everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old trolley poles , the Goldbergs will find it out . As a matter of fact , they actually did buy a lot of old trolley poles , over in Trenton . Later they shipped them out to China to be used in irrigation wells  --  some use that a Chinaman and a Goldberg would know about , but that we would n't . When the S.S. Wisconsin Bridge sank off Nassau in 1929 , nobody except the Goldbergs bothered much about its cargo of iron pipe . They salvaged it and sold it to orange-growers in nearby Florida , to he used for irrigation pipe . Which reminded the elder Goldberg of the time he bought dozens and dozens of old army ambulances . He sold them for fruit-pickers ' wagons to farmers in Florida and California . The huge supply of old-fashioned four-footed bathtubs was a harder problem . Everybody in this country wants a fancy bathroom nowadays . The Goldbergs finally discovered just the market for the old tubs  --  in Jamaica , B. W. I. , of all places . That market 's been oversold now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trappers and dreamers up in Canada . After the armistice , the Goldhergs bought five of the army camps from the government . One of these , Camp Funston , had cost $21,000,0011 to build  --  the Goldhergs got it very cheap . They advertised in farm papers : " Uncle Sam now makes it possible for you to build a house for $ LOO " They let the farmers move in on the camps and rip out all the lumber and iron pipe they needed , Thus the Goldhergs did n't have to pay a nickel for the wrecking of the camps . In one of them they found 100,000 brand-new bugles  --  we did n't believe this at first , but young Goldberg crossed his heart . All of these were sold to kids , through ads in boys ' magazines . The latest adventure of the Gold-bergs was the buying up of a cargo of nuts from a steamship company  --  the importer had folded . The Gold-bergs found out that these were the kind of nut used in making buttons , so they had buttons made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Telephone Tale IT 'S been a long time since we told you a story about our old friend , the Telephone Company . We 're mentioning them now only to report that they seem to have worked up a new speech to cover a certain situation . A little three-year-old boy , named Junior Somebody , who lives out on Long Island , was playing about his house one Saturday afternoon , and suddenly announced to his father that he was going to call up Mother , who was out playing bridge . Father was busy worrying , and did n't pay much attention , until he discovered that Junior had been using the real telephone instead of his toy one . He rescued the instrument and put the receiver hack on the hook . " What did Mother say ? " he asked . " She was mad , " Junior reported . " She said , ' Will you quit playing with that telephone ! " " Will Luks LIVE years ago , when we wrote a little piece about the mouse-colored Northern Dispensary , the old charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in charge of Will Luks , brother of the late George Luks , the painter . This oversight came to us the other day when we dropped in there to ask if it was true that Edgar Allan Poe had once visited the Dispensary , complaining of a cold . ( He had . ) Anyway , Will Luks has been superintendent there since 1905 , if you can imagine that . He lives upstairs , in diggings that smell faintly of formaldehyde . He 's a big , red , profane man , as loquacious and entertaining as his more celebrated brother used to he . He has one rather disconcerting mannerism  --  an idiosyncrasy of speech which you have to get used to . As we sat chatting with him , he pulled out a leaflet describing the Dispensary and , pointing to an illustration , said , " I drew that , deedle-ti-doo . " " What ? " we said . " I say I drew that , " he repeated , " doodle-de-dee . " We went into a daze right away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another drawing : " Drew that , too , bum hum . " We finally pulled ourself together and realized that if Mr. Luks was that way , he was that way , and we would just have to adjust to it . Although not an M.D. himself , he heads a staff of five doctors , five dentists , two nurses , and one admitting clerk . He once studied medicine at the University of Maryland , but only for a lark . He left after a time , and got married . His three children of that marriage are all Phi Beta Kappas , which seems an odd fact to be putting in here . When the gold rush was on in Alaska , Will set out for the North for another lark , but stopped off in New York on his way This proved fatal to his plan . While here he met William Linn , then superintendent of the Dispensary ; Linn fell ill , asked Luks to pinch-hit for him at the Dispensary , which Luks did . Linn died , and Luks stayed on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative phases , has dabbled with painting and poetry , His brother George used to roar at him , " Will , I wish you 'd stop talking and paint . " But the nearest he got to it were random sketches , nothing very serious . He wrote one hundred and ten sonnets in the space of four months , fifteen years ago , but never tried to have them published . He is also an inventor  --  invented an artificial rubber , an artificial resin , and a device to prevent babies from being smothered in their cribs by cats curling up and sleeping on their faces . HL had heard of babies ' dying that way , so he devised a framework that fits into the crib . Used it on his own little girl , and no cat ever slept on her face , doodle-de-doo . At present he is gathering material for a biography of George . " He could draw , God damn it ! " he shouted at us . " Most of these birds who call themselves artists ca n't draw . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their father in the old gentleman 's ninety-first year , painted with ordinary house paint . He has another Luks , which he bought for fifteen dollars without knowing who had painted it . Later he learned that George had put such a low price on it so that one of his pupils , who was poor , could buy it and own a genuine Luks . George was sore as anything . One of the stories Will likes to tell about the Dispensary is of the dyspep tic man who , observing the excellent health of his canary , tried eating sand for roughage and had to have his stomach pumped out , bum burn . Warning DRIVING home rather late the other night , a lady we know was waved over to the curb by a cop just as she was turning off the Avenue . " What 's the matter ? " she asked . " Lady , " said the cop , " do n't you know that when you turn a corner you ought to make an audible hand signal ? "
