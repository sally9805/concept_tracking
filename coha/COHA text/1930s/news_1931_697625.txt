txt The belief among administration Senators that President Hoover desires passage of the $74,000,000 navy construction bill by this session of Congress , instead of having it sidetracked , increased the determination of certain of them today to push the measure ahead . At a meeting of the Republican steering committee it was decided immediately to sound out House leaders to see if the bill can be acted upon in that body at this session . If the committee members can be assured that the House leaders can get action in that body there is little doubt that the bill will be shoved ahead in the Senate . Meanwhile sponsors of the bill In the House were moving for speedy action . Chairman Britten of the naval committee filed application for a special rule giving it prior status , which , according to Chairman Snell of the Rules Committee , probably will be granted . Mr. Britten said he would not push his application for the next few days , however , preferring to await assurances from administration Senators that the bill will not be thrown into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House . House leaders feel that the bill would stand a much better chance of enactment if passed first in the Senate . The Senate is the body with unlimited debate and the one in which the potential controversy in the construction bill might easily force an extra session . Under its rules , the House can act within a few hours , despite any amount of controversy . The belief that President Hoover would like to see the bill enacted this session arose from information that the State Department had made representations to certain leaders urging its passage as a step toward building up the navy to the limits prescribed in the London naval treaty . Senator Goff , chairman of the steering committee , takes the attitude that non-passage of the bill might be considered by other nations as a failure by the United States to live up to the terms pf the London pact . He and other friends of the building program argue ? that , ' as France and Italy are non-participants in the treaty , and there is agitation against the pact in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fulfilling an implied obligation . Denial that the London treaty expressed or Implied any obligation to build up the navy to the limit of the treaty 's terms was made in the House today by Representative French of Idaho , chairman of the naval appropriations subcommittee . He said that rough estimates of the cost of building up the United States fleet to the treaty limits ranged from $750,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 over a period of a little Aiore than sit years . " There can ' be no justification for any such expenditure of money , an expenditure that would treble the appropriations that we have made for new construction work on an average for each of the last ten years , " declared Mr. French . Mr. , French said that the provisions of the treaty were " limitations " which constituted privileges , and not obligations . In answer to questions by Representative Britten , who engaged in a word duel with Mr. French for more than an ? hour , the Idaho member said he favored the $74,000,000 building bill now pending , but denied that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " French Lists Problems . " It is possible , " said Mr. French , " to give a fair outline of what the proposed London treaty will cost the United States in money , provided we insist upon building up to the limitations within the treaty and construe the limitations as an obligation to build . " Turning to battleships , it would mean that the three that are to be decommissioned would be kept in full commission to the last day possible under the terms of the treaty , one year hi the case of two ships and eighteen months in the case of the other . " It would mean an obligation to construct 69.000 tons of aircraft carriers . " It would mean an obligation not only to consruct all the 8-inch gun cruisers that the treaty permits but in addition 73,000 tons of the 6-inch gun cruisers over and above what we have today . " In ' the matter of destroyers , it would be possible ' to replace 150,000 tons and between ' 20,000 and 25,000 tons of submarines . " More than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those who are urging the ever-expanding program would insist that it is necessary ) to provide one-fourth of our 6-inon , gun cruisers with landing decks far am craft . By implication we would need to add possibly 2,000 airplanes to our aircraft program . " Rough estimates of what this building program would cost run from $750,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 between now and 1936 . The period of time is little more than six years . It would mean an annual naval construction program of $125,000,000 to $150,000,000 for the United States for fighting types of craft . " From the standpoint of national finances I submit there can be no justification for any such expenditure of money . " Do the gentlemen hail the London conference a success who see only that it means multiplying in this enormous fashion the ? cost of naval armaments ? It would be a perversion of the magnificent work of President Hoover and Prime Minister and the able dele ' gates to the London conference to transform a limitations agreement into a mandate for expansion progrards . " But that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fighting craft mean auxiliary craft . ' ighting craft mean expansion in navy yards . Fighting craft mean personnel , both officer and enlisted personnal . The expansion of the navy of the United States to the limits that would be possible were that to be the interpretation of the London treaty would mean the increase of a burden of naval appropriations from an average of about $350,000,1-000 annually , as it has been durl ing the last eight years , to an annual cost of , between $500,000,000 and $600,000,000 . " Britten Urges Action at Once . In a statement issued later in the day Chairman Britten  --  reiterated his contention that a treaty navy should be started at once . " I am receiving telegrams from individuals and patriotic organizations all over the United States in which they view with alarm any Congressional failure to pass the naval construction program during ' . the present session of Congress , " said Mr. Britten . " Unless members of Congress are , aroused to the importance of immediate action I fear that the United States Navy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London conference might just as well never have occurred . " It is quite evident that pacifist propaganda and activity has found its way into every channel of the government in Washington , and , unless those interested in a proper national defense bestir themselves this great country of ours.must forever be content with a second-class navy . " If the London treaty is not intended as a mere scrap of Thgtper , it certainly is our solemn ? duty to live up to it , despite the fact that Chairman  --  Burton L. French , the littlenavy leader of the Committee on Ap -- propriations , today told the House that our national security would be lessened rather than - improved by our building up to the London treaty requirements . " It is my intention to have passed in the shortest possible time the new construction bill as a first step toward a London treaty navy ; the modernization of the battleships Mississippi , Idaho and New Medico and the so-called Britten line promotion bill , all of which have the support of the present administration from President Hoover down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Rules ou the Honne
