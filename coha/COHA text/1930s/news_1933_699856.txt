txt Strong criticism of the " persecution " of Jews in Germany was voiced during Senatorial discussion today , precipitated by Senator Robinson of Arkansas , the Democratic floor leader . The critical comment on Chancellor Hitler and his anti-Jewish policy was participated in by four other Senators after Senator Robinson had delivered a prepared speech in which he had said the German spectacle was " sickening and terrifying . " Whether by coincidence or otherwise , the topic was broached in the Senate within an hour after the President had transmitted the nomination of William E. Dodd of Illinois , distinguished scholar and author , to be Ambassador to Germany . Agreement with Senator Robinson 's speech came from both sides of the Senate chamber . No one rose either to question or dispute his statements . There was scattered applause , halted by a warning from the chair , when he said : " Such cruel policies as are referred to will bring their own penalties . They will result in loss of international prestige , in moral reaction among the German people of far-reaching effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deplores Prejudice . Senator Metcalf , a Republican , rose after Mr. Robinson 's address to say that " We as a nation can only declare the existence of racial or religious prejudice to be untenable as a national ideal . " This racial persecution has become a disquieting factor to the peace of the whole world . " he added . " A violation of religious freedom in any part of the world is a blow at the ideal all Americans have sought to perpetuate . " Senator Copeland paid a tribute to the Jews as a whole , mentioning Nathan Straus as an example of Jews whose work set an example for the world . He added that " the German people themselves " are not responsible for the " excesses . " Rather , he said , they " are under a power over which they have no control . " " But what the Senator from Arkansas has said , " Mr. Copeland declared . " will bring hope and cheer into the hearts of many persons in the State of New York . " Wagner ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the question of religious liberty . He said he himself spoke with a feeljng of deep and long friendship for Germany . since he had been born and spent his boyhood days there . Then he added : " I am struck with horror at the reports of intolerance , discrimination and even violence . This menace is a blot not only to the Jewish people and the German people but to the whole of mankind . 1 appeal to the German people , to millions of patriotic Germans . to unite with us in condemning actions that are threatening the basis of civilization . " Senator Wagner said the peace of the world was at stake and that economic recovery was impossible as long as discord and hate were displayed in Germany . Before the topic was dropped , Senators Walsh and Hatfield joined in denouncing the Jewish " persecution " in Germany . Senator Robinson 's Address . Senator Robinson 's speech , in full , follows : One of the unsolved mysteries of history is the recurrence of movements marked by intolerance and persecution . Admittedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer resorted to , save in rare instances ; nevertheless , in the larger aspects the manifestations of cruelty differ now only slightly from those of primitive times . It is both surprising and disappointing to one familiar with the character and disposition of the German people to take note of the alarming persecution of Jews , which , during recent months , has occurred in many parts of Ger- many . Apparently the conditions referred to originate in political policy supported by general public opinion . It is my conception of the German citizen that he is liberal in opinion and not usually disposed to act oppressively . Making due allowance for the exaggeration and misrepresentation which inevitably color reports of cruel incidents , there appears conclusive evidence that the Nazi Administration has startled and shocked mankind by the severe policies enforced against Jews  --  even those of only part blood . Evidence of Severity . The evidence to which reference is made is found : ( 1 ) In addresses delivered by German officials , including Chancellor Hitler and his Minister of Propaganda , Dr. Goebbels ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) in the remarks of speakers to mass meetings of German citizens ; ( 4 ) in the Nazi songs , and , ( 5 ) in the legislative and administrative political program . There is no attempt in this address to state in detail or even to summarize comprehensively the material facts , since to do so would require more time than is at my disposal . The most regrettable circumstance is disclosed in what appears to be the attitude of a large majority of the German citizens , which , while resulting in cruelty toward individuals of Jewish blood , also appears to support the policy of driving Jews from their occupations and of denying them the opportunity to earn their living . Hitler 's Statements Quoted . As early as 1924 , Chancellor Hitler wrote a book entitled " My Struggle . " The twelfth edition was printed in Munich in 1932 and is alleged to declare at page 70 : " If the Jew wins ? * * his crown of victory is the death wreath of humanity , and this planet will once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether bereft of men . * * * When I defend myself against the Jews , I fight for the work of the Lord . " At Page 344 , it is asserted : - " If , at the beginning of the war , 12,000 or 15,000 of these corruptors of the people had been held under poison gas , just as hundreds of thousands of our very best German workmen * * * had to bear it in the field , then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain . On the contrary , 12,000 scoundrels removed at the right time might perhaps have saved the lives of 1,000,000 proper Germans of value for the future . " Condemnation of Jews . At Page 279 of his book it is charged : " Thus , the Jew today is the great instigator of the complete destruction of Germany . Wherever in the world we read of attacks on Germany , they are manufactured by Jews , just as in peacetime and during the war , the Jewish stock exchange and the Marxist press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State after State gave up its neutrality . " ( Dr. Ernst ) ieeder , declaring himself commissioned by Hitler to issue official literature of the Nazi party , wrote : " Anti-Semitism is , in a way , the foundation of the feeling underlying our whole movement . * * * The German Reich shall be a home for the German , not for Jews , Russians ( Communists ) , Social Democrats , who have no fatherland called Germany , nor for all foreigners , who make a longer or shorter stay on German soil . " The Nazi Minister of Propaganda ( Dr. Goebbels ) , in the Nazi newspaper published at Munich in 1929 , at Page 8 , declared : " Certainly the Jew is also a human being * * * but the flea is also an * * * As the flea is not a pleasant animal , we do not feel any duty to ourselves and our conscience to guard and protect it , and to let it thrive so that it may bite , sting and torture us , but to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Citizenship Is Limited . The Nazi program provides that only persons of German blood may be citizens and that those who are not citizens shall be governed by laws regulating foreigners ; that only citizens may decide on leaders and laws of the State ; that Jews may not hold office or own , manage or control any newspaper , or practice law or sit as jurors or commercial judges . Jews whose ancestors have lived in Germany for hundreds of years " are thus deprived of the primary rights of citizenship . Six hundred thousand Jews lived in Germany at the outbreak of the World War in 1914 and 12,000 of them died in battle during that conflict . By a statute passed April 17 , 1933 , the right to practice law is denied all Jews . They are also denied the right to perform jury duty or to sit on the bench . Jewish doctors and dentists are outlawed by the cancellation of all contracts with them . Boycotts of Jewish druggists , clinics , opticians , dentists and X-ray institutes are prompted and encouraged . Ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and students . The right of Jewish children to attend primary schools is limited or denied . Almost every profession and vocation is closed against persons of Jewish blood . This astounding and oppressive policy is rendered the more intolerable by decrees forbidding Jews to leave Germany . Nazi songs sung at parades and mass meetings stimulate and crystalize the spirit of antiSemitism . It is sufficient to quote two stanzas : The Fatherland needs men , It is in dreadful plight . It is only when Jews die That German suffering ends . Thus do the storm columns Stand ready for the battle of the races . It is only when Jews bleed That we are liberated . Quite naturally this organized propaganda  --  carried on by writers and speakers prominent in political authority , embraced in the platform of the political party in control and in its songs of hatred  --  has stimulated and quickened public sentiment against the Jews in Germany to the extent that they have become discouraged and their defenders have been intimidated . Reports of Cruelty . Numerous incidents are reported by correspondents to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robberies and assaults with immunity from punishment . It is asserted upon what appears to be reliable authority that Jewish barristers and doctors have been beaten and driven through the streets of villages until they have fainted from exhaustion ; that thousands of Jews have attempted to flee the country , but that frontiers are closed by new passport regulations and escape has become difficult  --  almost impossible . As late as March 31 , 1933 , The London Times published reports that Jewish businesses and offices of Jewish lawyers and doctors were being picketed . It is sickening and terrifying to realize that a great people , whose advance during thousands of years has been marked by notable achievements in the arts and sciences , should respond to impulses of cruelty and inhumanity , which , when they have spent their force , will have lowered German civilization in the opinion of all peoples with whom Germany must have social and commercial relations throughout the future . Intervention Not Desired . It is not suggested that the United States intervene or attempt to determine the domestic policies of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring their own penalties . They will result in loss of international prestige , in moral reaction among the German people of far-reaching effect , in loss of trade and commerce . It has sometimes been said that the Israelities are a people without a country . In a sense that is true ; but in a broader sense is it r-oz known that Jews have made their home in every land ; that the characteristic of the Jew is peacefulness and respect for public authority ? His contribution to religion is recognized throughout the world . His racial integrity has continued in spite of contacts with gentiles for thousands of years in every land . It must be recognized that intolerance and persecution take many forms and , from time to time , their serpent-like heads appear to poison and terrify the tolerant and the just in every land . ' It is deplorable that education and enlightenment have not crushed and destroyed these foes of liberty and happiness . May we not with propriety express the hope that wholesome world opinion may influence sentiment in Germany so that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial hatred may be relaxed and the Jews again be permitted to enjoy fair freedom .
