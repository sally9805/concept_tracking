AMARANTH-Edwin Arlington Robinson-Macmillan ( $2 ) . <P> POEMS-Stephen Spender-Random House ( $1.50 ) . <P> POEM-W . H. Auden-Random House ( $2.50 ) . <P> Modern poetry , like experimental science , is always precocious to its day . Even William Wordsworth was once a misunderstood modern , a reprehensible revolutionary . Edwin Arlington Robinson , who last week published his eighth quiet narrative poem , was never considered a blasphemer of the literary gods , but once he was more modern than he is today . Now distinctly a member of the old guard , thrice crowned with the perishable bays of the Pulitzer Prize ( 1922 , 1925 , 1927 ) . Robinson is by long odds the most respected living U. S. poet . In his 65th year this New England Browning still turns out a lengthy blank-verse narrative that seems sometimes garrulous but never silly ; though his poetic fire is down to a low blue flame , it is not yet extinguished . Fed by no fiercely burning faith but well banked with the coke of agnostic irony , it may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson narratives , Amaranth is a tale of moral issues . This time the scene is set in a shadowy country not unlike a New England intellectualization of Hell . It is the place to which men are condemned who inhabit " the wrong world " - preachers who should have been lawyers , businessmen who should have been artists . Principal figure is a mediocre painter who escaped from " the wrong world " by becoming a pump-manufacturer ( " a spring-clean unimpeachable pump-builder " ) , then somehow relapsed . Saved from suicide and other tempting methods of flight by the mysterious figure of Amaranth , a symbolic embodiment of conscience , the erstwhile painter watches fate overtake the other inhabitants , eventually wins his release from the accursed country . Total effect of Amaranth is typically Robinsonian : a shadow masque seen through a glass darkly , by a keen but puzzled eye . <P> Between Poet Robinson and Poets Spender and Auden lies the gulf of the War .

To plain readers , who find Poet Robinson 's verbal sinuosities occasionally obscure , they may appear largely unintelligible . But youthful amateurs of poetry will con them with interest , sometimes with enthusiasm . Their elders will not be quick to applaud either their language or their sentiments : both grate harshly on a pre-War ear . <P> Of the two , Stephen Spender writes verse that more nearly approximates what has been traditionally known as poetry ; even Catos will clap his lines to a dead airman : <P> He will watch the hawk with an indifferent eye <P> Or pitifully ; <P> Nor on those eagles that so feared him , now <P> Will strain his brow ; <P> Weapons men use , stone , sling and strong-thewed bow <P> He will not know . <P> This aristocrat , superb of all instinct , <P> With death close linked <P> Had paced the enormous cloud , almost had won <P> War on the sun ; <P> Till now , like Icarus mid-ocean-drowned , <P> Hands , wings , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
