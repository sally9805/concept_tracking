AUTOBIOGRAPHY-John Cowper Powys- Simon &; Schuster ( $3.50 ) . <P> Since the world began , few men have thought or written so much about their precious selves as John Cowper Powys . If it were not for the personal pronoun and the exclamation point he would be tongue-tied . A more unabashed egotist than most authors , he gave his ego a field day last week by publishing a grotesque 595-page autobiography . Whether or not the mirror he holds up to himself is distorted , most readers will agree that the image it reflects is a little cracked . Author Powys admits : " I know , and I daresay my reader will willingly bear me out in this , that I am - all the while - never wholly sane . " He has tried to report his life as if he were confessing to " a priest , a philosopher , and a wise old woman . " Readers who are not in those categories will be sometimes bored , sometimes infuriated , at most times skeptical , but they will admit that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admission . <P> Eldest of eleven children of an English country parson , apparently a solid character , John Cowper Powys was erratic from the start . From early childhood , he says , his life was dominated by a besetting neurotic sin . He calls it sadism but from the many examples he gives it sounds more like the peeping passion . As a young man he used to make trips to Brighton for the sole purpose of looking at girls ' legs as they lay on the beach . For years he periodically bought and feverishly devoured armfuls of French pornographic books . When he first went to Manhattan , penny-in-the-slot peep-shows were his delight until he discovered the more compelling joys of the burlesque theatre . He had other eccentricities : he always ar ranged his knife and fork on his plate so that they should not point at his breast , was forever washing his hands , could not bear anything made of cotton . It still sets his teeth on edge to think of wiping his mouth with a napkin ; he does it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuroses , Powys sometimes turned them to account . At school he got out of a disagreeable fix by successfully pretending to be mad . His vociferous strangeness attracted a few disciples at Cambridge . When he went to the U. S. in 1905 and began to lecture , he found his metier : " Yes , the platform has been everything to me . It has been the bed of my erotic joys . It has been the battlefield of my fiercest struggles . It has been the gibbet of my execution . It has been the post of my scourging . It has been my throne . It has been my close-stool . It has been my grave . It has been my resurrection . On the platform I have expressed by a whisper , by a silence , by a gesture , by a bow , by a leer , by a leap , by a skip , by the howl of a wolf , by the scream of a woman in travail , certain inspirations concerning the secrets of life that , without any vain boasting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world .
