Years ago , discouraged by debts and annual babies , John started drinking " like a hog in a bucket of slops .

He bought a 200-acre farm , raised a family , slipped a little each year as the land got poorer . Now he philosophizes : " Life do n't work like a job of work . You study out how to do a job and do it . But when it comes to living , they 's not any way you can plan it and have it go according . " He does n't blame the Government though .
