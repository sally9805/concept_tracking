One evening in November 1926 , a brand new hockey team skated out on the ice of Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden . First was stocky , mournful-looking Bun Cook , who superstitiously insists on touching the ice before his teammates . Behind him glided his pugnacious Brother Bill , team captain , with whom he owns a big wheat farm in Saskatchewan , big , bald , grinning Ivan Wilfred ( " Ching " ) Johnson , slender Frank Boucher , and a youngster named Murray Murdoch . With a few other teammates they made up the New York Rangers . They played that night against the Montreal Maroons . <P> One night last week these same five players stood under a spotlight in the middle of the same rink , while adoring home-towners cheered wildly . It was the Rangers ' 400th game . These charter members had stuck together from the start , had helped win the Stanley Cup twice , had put the team into the play-offs every season , and , since last Christmas , had hoisted it from bottom to top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the first period of last week 's game , with the score 1-to-1 , ceremonies took place . Diamond signet rings were presented to the famed forwards-Cook-Boucher- &-Cook; to Johnson , defense man who has raised a five-year-old son since that first game in the Garden ; to silver-haired Manager Lester Patrick and to weather-beaten little Trainer Harry Westerby . When Murray Murdoch 's turn came , there was a special ritual . Out stepped Lou Gehrig , baseball 's " iron man , " who has played 1,350 consecutive games with the New York Yankees . He presented the ring to Murdoch , only Ranger to play in each and every one of the team 's 400 games , an unheard-of record in hockey . In eight seasons he had suffered nothing worse than flesh gashes and lost teeth . A strong , tireless skater , he has gained 20 lb. during his Ranger career . His most famed exploit was making three goals within a minute in a game against Boston . One of the goals , however , was nullified because he stepped on the puck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost their ceremonial anniversary game . Instead , they swamped the Ottawa Senators 5-to-2 . <P> The case of Toronto 's Irvin ( " Ace " ) Bailey , who was injured almost fatally in a game against the Boston Bruins last December , had two new aftermaths last week : 1 ) Toronto 's Manager Connie <P> Smythe demanded that the League compel the Bruins to compensate Bailey , beyond the $6,700 which he received from a benefit game in Boston . The League governors compromised by ordering another benefit game , between the Toronto club and an all-star team made up of players from the other clubs . 2 ) Eddie Shore , Boston 's crack defense man who was suspended for spilling Bailey , returned to the ice against the Rangers in Manhattan . His team had slipped into last place largely because of his absence . Heartened by sympathetic cheers from a gallery which nearly always booed him , Shore recovered his nerve , played a lusty game but could not save his team from a 4-to-2 whipping .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
