Amid the barren , mud-colored hills surrounding Chile 's Chuquicamata , stood last week a knot of enthusiastic newshawks . They had stopped off on their way home from a Pan-American Press Conference at Valparaiso for a gigantic entertainment specially staged for them by the world 's largest copper mines . They were to see one of the world 's largest explosions , the firing of 3,000,000 Ib. of dynamite . <P> In the mine 's open terrace workings , from which ore is grabbed by twelve mechanical shovels , the dynamite had been laid . All was nearing readiness for the festive blowoff and the newshawks , standing at a safe distance , plugged their ears , braced themselves for the shock . At that moment an electric engine rolled up drawing two cars of black powder . Five workmen and a foreman started unloading it . <P> In some unexplained manner the black powder exploded , prematurely set off the dynamite charge . <P> Up from earth 's bowels were vomited 100,000 tons of ore . Miners ' huts for miles around shuddered in convulsion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shovels . Boulders flew like buckshot with here and there a human leg or arm , some landing as much as a mile distant . When the storm had passed 55 lay dead , 201 injured . Stricken with horror , the newshawks rushed from their vantage point to become stretcher-bearers and ambulance drivers . Hundreds of weeping women surged to the mine 's terraces , searched hysterically among mountains of debris for husbands and sweethearts . To begin an immediate in vestigation , the Governor of Antofagasta Province hurried to the scene , declared : <P> " This is the most serious accident of its kind in Chile 's history .
