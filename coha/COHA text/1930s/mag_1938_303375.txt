A chewy , chocolate-covered concoction of peanuts and fudge , Oh Henry ! is one of the three best-selling 5 candy bars in the U. S. ( others : Milky Way , Baby Ruth ) . Like most confectioners , Oh Henry 's maker-a subsidiary of $1.250.000 General Candy Corp. - is pestered with damage suits . In 1936 , 100 people claimed they had broken teeth , bruised gums or damaged their digestion on stones , twigs , wires and nails that slipped by Oh Henry ! inspectors . Last year , General 's President George Huhn Williamson , following the example of W. F. Schrafft &; Sons Co. , installed two $3.000 Adrian fluoroscopes ( Xray machines ) , routed as many as 40,000 boxes of Oh Henry ! bars through them a day . With claims cut in half , Confectioner Williamson , last week , had two more machines installed .
