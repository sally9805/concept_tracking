Henry Harrington 's internal life has not been happy . For 18 of his 45 years he has had pains in his stomach . Last month he entered Philadelphia 's Hahnemann Hospital , where physicians at first thought his left kidney might be displaced . Then an x-ray showed a growth in his stomach . But on an x-ray plate exposed a week later the growth had disappeared . The physicians were stumped . As may any prolonged internal discomfort , Henry Harrington 's pains might indicate cancer . But with x-ray there was no way to tell until the cancer should attain a considerable mass . Last week Dr. John Falenks of Manhattan went to the physicians ' aid with something new to the U. S. Named " Gastro-Photo , " it was a stomach camera invented in Vienna by F. G. Bach and Dr. D. J. Heilpern , already in use at the University of Vienna 's Wenckel Bach Clinic . <P> Physicians led lanky Henry Harrington into an operating room , stood him up against a wall . Patient Harrington took a look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " commanded Dr. Falenks , forthwith thrusting into his mouth a metal cylinder two inches long and one-half inch thick , attached to a long rubber tube . Punctured by 16 pinholes , the cylinder contained a tiny flash bulb and two pieces of film . <P> " Swallow , " said Dr. Falenks . Henry Harrington 's sharp adam 's apple bobbed twice and the camera was in his stomach . Dr. Falenks squeezed a rubber bulb in his left hand , sent a puff of air down the tube to distend the patient 's stomach walls . Then he pressed a button in his right hand . A metal shutter clicked open the 16 pinholes , Henry Harrington 's dark interior flared up with the brilliance of 20,000 candles and in 1/120th of a second 16 views of his stomach were registered on the films . <P> The prints , explained Dr. Falenks , would show humps as whitish and holes as dark blurs , thus reveal the first sign of cancer or ulcer . Philadelphia physicians withheld comment until the films should be developed . But everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better . Dr. Falenks was sure the Gastro-Photo marked a noteworthy advance in the incessant cancer war .
