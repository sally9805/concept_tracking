Only Negro airman known to the U. S. at large is Hubert Fauntleroy ( " Black Eagle " ) Julian , who once cracked up Haile Selassie 's private plane in Ethiopia and is now in Manhattan , talking about flying . In fact , the U. S. has licensed 129 Negroes as commercial , private and student pilots , including Student Julian , whose license expired last year , and twelve women . Air-minded Negroes have learned to fly at six schools run by &; for their race , at 43 more for whites and blacks . <P> Last week the U. S. Army Air Corps confronted the possibility that it also might have to train and commission Negro pilots . This prospect ( awful to the all-white corps ) loomed after the Senate passed the $366,250,000 rearmament authorization bill ( TIME , March 13 ) . Besides upping the authorized strength of the Air Corps to 6,000 planes , the Senate , at the behest of Wyoming 's Harry H. Schwartz , voted to train Negroes in at least one school for Army fledglings . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government Employes , Inc. , Editor Robert L. Vann of the Pittsburgh Courier , many another colored advocate of racial balance in the U. S. Army &; Navy . <P> Much distressed , the Air Corps quietly went to work on Capitol Hill to get Negro training killed or unload it on the Civil Aeronautics Authority before the rearmament bill is finally enacted . <P> Two other rearmament jokers flustered the War Department last week : 1 ) Under an amendment sponsored by " Dear Alben " Barkley for C.I.O. , a department head may not award any contracts for national defense to bidders whom he finds guilty of unfair labor practices . 2 ) New Hampshire 's Republican Charles William Tobey got the Senate to limit profits on Army aircraft contracts to 10% ( as in the Navy , where a similar limitation has been in effect since 1934 ) .
