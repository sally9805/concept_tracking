txt With only 5,000 of the city 's 12,000 taxicabs in operation as a result of the strike of members of the Taxicab Drivers Union , the Regional Labor Board intervened yesterday in an effort to end the walkout . Following a conference of the board , attended by Ben Golden , executive secretary , Mrs. Elinore M. Herrick , acting chairman , announced she had sent telegrams to the large fleet owners and officials of the striking organization , inviting them to confer at the board offices , 45 Broadway , at 5 P. M. today . There are to be separate conferences with officials of the large companies , the Parmelee , Terminal and Radio , and with representatives of the union , preparatory to what the board hopes will be a I joint conference of all the companies and the strikers . Both Sides Criticized . Mrs. Herrick issued the following statement , in which she criticized the refusal of both sides heretofore to cooperate in a settlement of the dispute in response to appeals by the Mayor 's office and the Labor Board : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the taxicab strike and all officials of the striking union to a conference at the Regional Labor Board office at 5 P. M. Monday . I expect that all those receiving the invitation of the board will accept and will cooperate with the board to end a strike which has effectively tied up taxi service , to the great inconvenience of the public and the consequent impairment of the recovery program . " While both owners and union are summoned to attend at the same hour , I do not expect to hold a joint conference of the two groups , though that will undoubted. ly become necessary . Repeated requests from both the Mayor 's office and the Labor Board to both groups to submit their ideas as to the basis on which the strike could be terminated have been ignored by both groups . The board is still willing to consider all proposals that either group may submit . " When informed of the invitation , Sam Orner , president of the Manhattan branch of the Taxicab Drivers Union and leader of the strike , said it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would respond . No statement was obtainable from the large companies pending receipt of the invitation . Heretofore the companies have declined to deal with the striking union . " I believe we will be there , " said Mr. Orner . " We left the door open in all of our statements so that there would be no doubt whatever as to our willingness to meet the officials of the various companies against which the strike is directed and to discuss with them the possibility of settlement of the strike . " Union Recognition Sought . Mr. Orner declared that recognition of the union was the principal demand of the strikers and that the question of wages and hours is , being held in abeyance for future negotiation , He said the union will insist upon such recognition , elimination of what he called the " black . list " and of discrimination against union drivers and Negro members of the union . According to Mr. Orner , 27,000 men are on strike in the five boroughs , including men employed on all shifts and extra help , and 11,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Radio systems are the principal ones affected , Mr. Orner said , the strike has also tied 1 up small fleets operating from twenty to sixty cabs . He declared seventeen owners of such fleets signed up with the union yesterday . Reports received at Police Head ' quarters from the large companies yesterday were that only 5,000 cabs were in operation in the city . Of the 12,000 cabs normally on the streets about half are operated by independents , who are not affected by the strike order . Spokesmen for the large fleets maintained , however , that the number of cabs tied up was due more to " intimidation " than to the actual number of men on strike . At a meeting in Webster Hall , Eleventh Street and Third Avenue , yesterday , representatives of various organizations , most of them affiliated with the " Left Wing " movement , collected nearly $1,000 for the strikers . Among the contributors was the Communist party . Needle Trades Pledge Aid . Irving Potash , secretary of the Needle Trades Industrial Union , an organization led and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pledged his organization 's support to the strike . He urged the members of his union to cooperate with the strikers " both morally and physically . " Mr. Orner , who was one of the speakers , told the meeting that 2,000 independent drivers and owners are cooperating with the striking union by contributing $4 a day each to the union 's strike fund . He challenged the contention that his union was employing " guerrillas " to aid in the strike . " The union does not . need any guerrillas to help , " he said . " The drivers are pretty good , with their fists and know how to use them , I have found . We do n't need any gangsters to help us . Let the police do what they are supposed to do and let our boys alone . " He said the union was fighting the cause of the independents as well as of its own members and denied that the payment of $3 a day made by independent drivers or owners to the union 's fund was " extortion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A charge that the union was guilty of " extortion " in receiving these payments was made earlier in the day by Hugo Werner , president of the Broad Street Taxi Owners Association , an organization of independents claiming to represent 2,000 owners . Mr. Werner said his association as well as other organizations of independents had agreed to pay the union $2 a day for each cab in exchange for being permitted to operate during the strike , but that the union was " extorting " a fee of $3 a day plus an initiation fee of fifty cents . Mr. Werner said he would seek indictments against those responsible for this . " There is nothing smacking of extortion in these payments , " Mr. Orner insisted . " The payments are voluntary contributions to our relief fund on the basis of recognition of the fact that our strike is a fight not only in behalf of our men but also of the independents . The fact remains that most of the organizations of the independents have suggested even higher contributions than those being made . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parmelee Chapter ) , characterized by the strikers as a company union , said that more than 2,000 men employed by the Parmelee Company had promised the brotherhood they would report for work at 6 o'clock this morning at the various garages of the system . " These men are sick and tired of being out of work , " Robbins declared . " The Taxicab Drivers ' Union has not lived up to its promises to provide strike relief , saying that it has no funds with which to do so . Hunger is driving the men back to work , and they have sworn that they will meet violence with violence , if necessary . " The brotherhood yesterday mailed a request to John J. Bennett , Attorney General , to extend his racket investigation to the taxicab industry in this city . " More than 3,000 members of the brotherhood , who are not on strike , are the real victims , " the letter said in part . " Cabs are operating on the streets , but the owners have been forced to pay a high tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York . We can furnish you with evidence that this tribute has actually been paid . This is distinctly a job for the Attorney General . " Fifteen hundred strikers attended a meeting last night at n Arlon Place , Brooklyn . Hyman Goldstein , president of the Brooklyn branch of the union , presided . He said 5,400 Brooklyn taxicab drivers had lined up with the union and many independent fleet owners had signed up . The drivers adopted a resolution expressing their determination to remain on strike until their demands are granted ,
