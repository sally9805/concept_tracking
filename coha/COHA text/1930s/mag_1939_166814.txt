Last week the pinko weekly New Republic gave itself a 25th birthday party . To its swank , Lescaze-designed Manhattan skyscraper office it invited representatives of that amorphous , shifting , elusive , body of opinion that is known as U. S. liberalism , displayed for them a 94-page supplement called The Promise of American Life . Present were amiable Robert Morss Lovett , Government-Secretary of the Virgin Islands , a New Republic editor for 18 years ; Freda Kirchwey , editor of The Nation , the rival ( 74-year-old ) liberal intellectual journal that looked exactly like the New Republic to outsiders , very different to liberal intellectuals . Present also were contributors , constant readers , free traders , isolationists , progressive educators , single taxers , practicing Marxists , disillusioned Marxists , poets , professors , publishers , all who believe themselves to be liberals , all who thus claim to fit into a category that nobody has satisfactorily defined . <P> History . When Herbert Croly launched his new liberal " journal of opinion " 25 years ago , definition was easier . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moose progressivism , the settlement house movement , the suffragette movement , the I.W.W. , liberals were also many things , but they were above all hopeful . In an aged brownstone house in Manhattan 's Chelsea district , with a theological seminary appropriately across the street , and a House for the Detention of Women next door , Editor Croly ran his magazine to establish a liberal credo , a way of looking at U. S. political and social life , rather than to win a practical political objective . A scholar-his field was U. S. history-and a gentleman , Herbert Croly was also almost a great editor . His unruly staff , over whom he never exercised the full powers of an editor , had one common admiration-Croly . Through the New Republic 's respectable but rundown portals passed some of the most incongruous people in the world : Greenwich Village poets , workers from Chicago 's Hull House , old-style Caribbean revolutionaries , retired burglars , Messianic booksellers , musicians from Wall Street , bearded atheists , Nicodemus-like lawyers , authors from Idaho , Junior Leaguers and Bryn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visionaries and practical reformers who somehow were attracted by Founder Herbert Croly.
