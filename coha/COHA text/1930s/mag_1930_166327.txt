Samples : <P> Individualism must be drugged that Communism may succeed . <P> Villages do not follow towns to Communism . Towns must drag villages to Communism . <P> These cold , metallic conceits were fired at the tousled heads of a delegation of Marxist agrarian workers ( i. e. , farmers ) , whom Dictator Stalin was addressing on the stirring topic : Destroying the Kulak or Rich Farmer as a Class . <P> Since in any country rich farmers are always the most conservative not to say reactionary class , it has been obvious from the first that they must be destroyed in Soviet Russia , but recently this has not seemed practical .

But Stalin served fair warning that this will be done as soon as the Government 's collectivist industries reach a point of efficiency at which the businessman can safely be converted into the collectivist business worker . <P> " If we retain the Nep , " * said the cold Man of Steel , " it is because the Nep , in its way , serves our cause . But when the Nep ceases to do that then we shall throw the Nep to the Devil !
