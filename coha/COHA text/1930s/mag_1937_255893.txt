You 've got ta , ' cause Captain says you 've <P> got ta , <P> You 've got ta . . . bow . . . down . <P> These words , sung to the taut accompaniment of a studio orchestra , emerged last Sunday night from such U. S. radios as were tuned in on Columbia Broadcasting System 's " Workshop of the Air " ( producer of Archibald MacLeish 's radio play in verse , Fall of the City , Stephen Vincent Bent 's Paid Revere ) . The Captain who expected people to bow down was , it appeared , a Fascist , for his " Purple Shirts " aimed to exterminate " the mongrel race . " Mr. Musiker , the composer who wanted to present to someone a tune that was running through his head , found the Purple Shirts anything but worthy of it . Nor did he like the silly way Mrs. Arbutus , a Park Avenue matron , sang it . Finally , after Mr. Musiker 's tune had gone around the world ( " they made a lullaby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orchestra ) , Mr. Musiker came upon some students , presumably radical since they were singing Pie in the Sky . He was glad to give them his tune , for a marching song . <P> Thus went I 've Got the Tune , written and composed for Columbia 's Workshop by Marc Blitzstein , whose The Cradle Will Rock rocked the WPA Federal Theatre in Manhattan last spring ( TIME , June 28 ) , will be put on Broadway this fall on a number of Sunday nights . I 've Got the Tune , with Composer Blitzstein singing the role of Mr. Musiker , was his and the Workshop 's first venture in radio operetta . For some listeners , Blitzstein 's mocking libretto was not without class-conscious implications , even his wiry-muscled music suggesting the notion voiced in The Cradle Will Rock-that " there 's something so damned low about the rich .
