txt A recommendation that life insurance companies be authorized to invest their funds for a limited time and in a limited amount in the construction of low rental apartments and small home developments is to be placed before the New York Legislature today by Superintendent of Insurance , Louis H. Pink . At the same time , the Superintendent revealed that a bill is being drafted by counsel for the department for tentative suggestion to the Governor and the Legislature .

Passage of such legislation would permit the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. to embark on its 5100,000.000 of low-scale housing projects , as announced last week . Rental range of the Metropolitan dwellings would be between $8 and 515 a room a month , Superintendent Pink said .
