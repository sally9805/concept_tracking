ALUMNI notes , as we may have said before , are to us the most vivid and fascinating of all reading . We admire and respect their chronology and their pith . It is a particular pleasure to find , among the notes of the current Groton School Quarterly , what seems likely to stand as the most masterly report ever written of the doings of the class of ' BO of any school . There are only two items , so we can reprint the report in full : 1900 . Dr. Edward B. Krumbhaar has recently been elected President of the American Society of Cancer Research . Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President of the United States on November 5th . THE town was strangely quiet the first morning of the bank holiday . Every time a liner in the river blew its whistle , people jumped . feeling that if anybody rank and started down the street at a fast trot , the whole town would have followed him , thinking he knew where to go . On his knees in front of the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gravely doing some dusting with a long brush . " Dusting her off , eh ? " we cried . And as he looked around we handed him two little ninth halls , in a spirit of fun . THE man who really took it on the chin last week was Harry Walker , of Harry Walker , Inc. , Suite 215 , Strand Theatre Building . Mr. Walker dispatched seventeen beautiful girlson the S.S. Pennsylvania bound for Panama on Saturday , March 4 , thinking to pay a graceful tribute to Mr. Herbert Hoover , who was booked to sail that day . Mr. Hoover changed his plans and did n't sail , but Mr. Walker did n't see how he could change his very well , and the seventeen beautiful girls sailed . " Sending these girls at this time is my tribute to the President , " he had written the newspapers . All unphotographed , and with not a soul on hoard to pay tribute to , the seventeen lovely creatures sailed away , beautiful in the afternoon light . THERE are only three shops left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Periwinkle " ) Blue . It is getting so it is more of a distinction not to have originated Eleanor ( " Periwinkle " ) Blue than to have originated it . We got a letter from one concern bawling us out for not saying that they had created the shade . " The nearest established shade to it was Hyacinth Blue , " they wrote , " hut to have called it Hyacinth Blue would have been duplicity . " They inclosed , as evidence of their priority , two swatches and a letter from Mrs. Roosevelt , We thought the whole matter over , decided it was out of our field , and turned the swatches over to the police . THIS department received , as a matter of fact , quite a number of rebukes last week . The most startling was from a lady who signed herself " A Bomber 's Wife . " She proudly reported that her husband , in utter disregard of our peaceful views , was flying a bombing plane above the inaugural parade . We answered promptly , in our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only bomb that could possibly have been suitable to the occasion  --  a Bomb of Gilead . A NOTHER was from a reader who 11 complained that we were not consistent . One minute we were weeping mawkish tears over evicted people , the next minute we were telling about race horses and other frivolous matters . Perhaps we better make it clear to our readers that we have renounced consistency as an instrument of editorial policy , and that we have appointed Mr. E. Tilley to the post of Secretary of Consistency . WE 'VE just heard about a new de-VV VV a radio control for garage doors . Without getting out of your car , you can open the garage by radio . It does n't sound roes good . If the government takes over the radio , which there is talk of , the only way you could get into your garage would be by writing your congressman . YOU would think that , at a rime I when everyone 's nerves are on edge , people would make some attempt to soften life 's blows for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue the other noon we saw a small nervous man set upon by a pack of cadaverous soda clerks , who were just out to get him . The soda counter was crowded with lunchers , and the timid man went clear to the rear of the store so that he could ask inconspicuously for a yeast cake . " Yeast cake ? " repeated the clerk , and turning to the next clerk : " Yeast cake ! " he shouted . " Yeast cake ! " sang out the second one , and pretty soon the pack were in full cry . " Yeast cake ! Yeast cake ! Yeast cake ! " they keened , while their quarry shriveled in his collar . Finally they handed over the embarrassing little morsel and the poor fellow went cringing out into the street . Gratitude ' THERE was a case in court a while 1 ago in which a man charged with burglary was acquitted by a jury . The masterly way the lawyer for the defence handled the matter impressed the jury , and apparently it impressed the defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he is an honorable man , do n't mistake us ) received a package in the mail . It was a hunting print , and was accompanied by this note : " Dear Boss , I was doing is job out Forest Hills way the other night and seen this , shot you might like it . " Babies Must Play Wurlitzer 's small platinum- colored stage the other morning there was an orchestra of babies playing simple , gay little songs ; they played them sombrely , with grave eyes . The reason we dropped in ( stumbling over a seat in the dark ) was that somebody had told us that the leader of the orchestra was eighteen months old . This was not true ; he was twenty-three months old , and he was just one of half a dozen leaders . None of the children in the New York infants ' orchestra is more than six years old . It was got together by Mr. Karl Moldrem , a tall , patient gentleman who has had twenty years ' experience teaching babies to play . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of them playing miniature violins , slowly and sadly , a tiny bit off time . In a corner , Mr. Moldrem sat at the piano , now and again giving instructions in a low voice . One little curly-haired boy sat before an empty music rack , without an instrument . We do n't know why . There was also , of course , a mother on the stage . She sat near a small towheaded violinist ( male ) of perhaps three , and seemed to be-annoying him terribly . Mothers always have to have a hand in their children 's lives , even to the point of sitting in their orches tras . It made us profoundly miserable . A six-year- old girl was sawing mournfully away when we entered . The song she fiddled was something like " Oh , Are n't We Gay When the Cat 's Away ! " but it sounded pretty melancholy . It was announced , when she was done , that Mr. Buster Collins , aged twenty-three months , would lead the next song . An eager , unabashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform , climbed onto a chair , hit the hack of it two sharp raps with a baton , and began leading . It was then the turn of a lovely little girl named Mary ( aged three years , one month ) to lead a piece  --  or at least so Mr. Moldrem announced . She climbed up on the chair , gave the two preliminary raps , and then Mr. Moldrem discovered that this was really the turn of a director named Ronald something-orother , aged two . Ronald ran up to Mary 's chair . Mr. Moldrem told her to step down . Mary , with fine indifference , started leading . The head man finally had to get up and lift her down ; they gave her a violin and let her sit in the front row and all was peaceful , Twenty years ago , Moldrem went to San Francisco , with some idea of becoming a violinist , but he found out that the town was full of excellent violinists and musicians generally , most of them under six He did n't relish the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager , so he became a teacher . He has founded twenty-six baby orchestras , twenty of which he gets around to with his personal attention at least once a year . There are , in all , about two hundred orchestras of children in the country , the fruits of Mr. Moldrem 's idea . His most famous children 's orchestra was the one in Hollywood . It played at the estates of Chaplin , Fairbanks , and other stars , and was put into newsreels twenty - four times . In 1930 , it gave one hundred and thirty concerts for charity ; six hundred thousand people , in all , attended them , and profits amounted to $130,000 .. Moldrem was asked by Wurlitzer 's to bring the orchestra to New York . This seemed like a good idea but it was n't . Child labor laws made it necessary to get the permission of every governor through whose state the kiddies ' train would pass . When Moldrem spent more than two months just getting the consent of California , he decided it would be easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to him until too late that he could have come by boat and thus avoided the child-law trouble . His New York orchestra has fifteen players , when all are an hand  --  violins , tympani , piano , clarinet . When Moldrem first started these orchestras , it was impossible to get a violin in America smaller than half-size . Now more than a thousand , of eighth and sixteenth sizes , are sold every year . We were wrong when we said there are only two hundred baby orchestras in the country ; it 's four hundred . We just looked it up . Pet VER in culture-loving New Jet-sey , a Mrs. X had some uneasy hours the other night . Mrs. X is chair-man of a committee which arranges for the delivery of culture in reason-able doses for the club of which she is president . She was pretty proud a while hack when she arranged for Mlle. Pons to come over and sing . The manager stipulated that Mlle. Pons , who was n't feeling too well , he taken care of in a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own , thinking that it was just to be used for rest before the evening ap-pearance , or maybe a little supper af-terward . She was surprised when she discovered that Mlle. Pons was Mlle. Pons , plus a manager , plus a maid , plus , of all things , a pet jaguar , and she was even more surprised when she com-prehended from this and that that Mlle. Pons , et al. , were staying the night . She tucked the whole crowd in , how-ever , and went to bed . It was along toward morning , in the darkest hours , that Mrs. X was awakened by strange sounds . She traced them to the bathroom and , after knock-ing and getting no answer , went in timidly . Curled neatly in the wash-basin , snoring now and again , was the pet jaguar . It opened an eye and growled slightly at the light . Mrs. X went away hurriedly and woke up the manager . The rnanaaer listened , sleepily . Then he said " Oh , it always sleeps in the washbasin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the jaguar , anyway , which slept the night through and was on hand in the morning to greet the other and unsuspecting members of the family when they went in to wash their faces . Nobody washed much , though . Old Master A many important people went through the Pennsylvania Station last week and that meant a busy time for Mr. William Egan , Among others , he saw off the Mayor O'Brien-Curry party , and was photographed with them at the gate to the tracks . Mr. Egan , who wears white gloves on these solemn occasions , is stationmaster for the Pennsylvania . His office in the station is famous . It 's practically papered with photographs , from floor to ceiling ; a couple of hundred . Assorted celebrities : Hoover , Coolidge , AI Smith , Walker , Chevalier , Ambassador Edge , Kate Smith , Admiral Beatty , Ramsay MacDonald , Hearst , Adolphe Menjou , Jean Harlow , and a hundred and eighty-odd others . Egan never buys 2 photo and lays for his man  --  they all sent him one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Egan has been stationmaster and unofficial greeter for the railroad since ' 97 , beginning at the old Twenty-third Street station . He was a freight brakeman in the eighties , a passenger brakeman in the nineties . He went through the Blizzard of ' 88 . Was brakeman on a train the road sent out kind of tentatively to see if it could reach Philadelphia . It could n't  --  got stalled at a town the other side of Elizabeth . The crew , including Egan , floundered through drifts to a small hotel , where they stayed five days . Then they worked their way back to the train , dug it out , and edged on  --  about an inch an hour , Bill says , but they got to Philadelphia . As stationmaster , Egan has charge of around a thousand persons , four hundred and fifty of them being Red Caps , the rest ushers , matrons , information clerks , and his own office staff . Of late years , the Master has largely relegated to underlings the simpler duties , such as seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks . He himself mainly looks to the arrivals and departures of the great . In doing this for more than thirty years he has become little short of pally with many of them . Calvin Coolidge , after he left the White House , spent some of his train-waiting time sitting on the brown sofa in Egan 's office . Mr Coolidge would tell stories and Egan and Mrs. Coolidge , when she was along , would listen . Teddy Roosevelt used to pop into the office between trains too , but he usually- worked on magazine articleS he was writing and did n't talk much . Egan is over six feet , erect , florid , deep-voiced . Everybody is fond of him . John D. , Senior , autographed a photo for him , using one of Bill 's pencils . Victor Herbert wrote some music and words on his picture : " It 's a great day for the Irish tonight . " The greatest day for the Irish at the Penn Station , however , was when De Valera arrived there  --  biggest crowd Egan ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the disposition of plainclothes men , city cops , and the station 's own staff of guards . He always shakes hands with arriving and departing celebrities , and escorts them personally off and on trains . Nobody has ever thrown a bomb or started a riot . Egan 's work also includes a lot of strange favors for people . He and his staff have matched material for flustered women , put special milk on trains for babies , rushed serum from the Bronx Zoo onto a train pulling out for a town where a man had been bitten by a snake , and taken charge of a pony , a cat , and a bowl of goldfish . Some pretty strange people have to be dealt with . Recently a young woman walked into Egan 's office with an American flag draped over each shoulder , and demanded a special train for Washington right away . Mr. Egan said that this would n't be possible and she walked out . Next day he read in the papers that she was an escaped lunatic . Egan wo n't ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia through the blizzard again . Answer THE management of one of our efficient mammoth hotels which is always up to something recently got together and evolved a questionnaire , partly to find out things and partly , one would suspect , to get the guest comfort-conscious . One of the questions was " Is n't this the most comfortable hotel you ever stayed in ? " and others were " Is the mattress as good or better than yours at home ? " and " Do you sleep better here than in your own home ? " The questionnaire , which was handed to guests to he filled out at their leisure , concluded with these two questions : " Do you wake up during the night ? " and " If so , what do you do ? " The hoped-for answer here was probably " I ring for my room service and get a sandwich at any hour . " A small , transient gentleman , registered as Mr. Irving Greenbaum , of Waterbury , Ohio , turned his in different , how-ever : Do you wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenbaum . If so , what do you do ? " I worry and think . " Poet and Janitor MO return to Mr. T. S. Eliot , the poet-lecturer , as we are practically driven to doing : He spoke and read verses at Brown University lately . The hall was filled and a friend who had come down from Harvard with him contented himself with standing in the wings at the side of the stage . All was dignified and solemn until the janitor of the hall appeared and plucked the poet 's friend by the elbow , showing him a little slip of paper . The gentleman did n't see anything to do about it and just shook his head . The janitor then looked toward Mr. Eliot , who was right in the midst of reading , very melodiously , " Ash ' Wednesday . " Then he squared his shoulders , walked out on the stage , and nudged Mr. Eliot . The poet came out of his mood with a dazed expression . The janitor willspcired to him , with gestures . Finally , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nodded . He took the slip of paper , looked at it , and read to the audience , " Mr. Early is urgently wanted on the telephone . " The audience laughed , the janitor looked indignant and then walked off . As he passed the friend in the wings , he spoke bitterly . " Jeez , " he said , " has that guy a thick head ! " Service NOW if the worst comes to the worst and you should ever want to get away from it all , and at the same time avoid the bother and expense of travel , the man to talk to is Mr. Richard Barry . You may have seen his ad in the Times Book Review : LOCAL COLOR I Manuscripts , letters mailed from any city in the world . International Mailing Service , 100 Fifth Avenue . Mr. Barry is the head of a truly international business , of his own invention . If you want to send some creditors postcards from Siberia , he 'll handle them  --  fifty cents apiece . For a dollar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pluhischtshe , a very remote Siberian hamlet . He 'll attend to mailing a letter from Palm Beach for twenty cents and a three-cent stamp . From the Riviera and other ordinary foreign points , it 's fifty cents , postage included . For a dollar , you may have a receiving address , good for three replies . The International Mailing Service came about rather naturally as a result of Mr. Barry 's experiences . After he graduated from the University of Michigan as a chemical engineer , he took to traveling all over the world . He has worked at practically everything except his profession : sailor , beachcomber , Hollywood extra , butcher , bartender in the Argentine , riding master . While he was doing all these things , he was also mailing letters for people who liked to startle their friends with greetings from far places . Eventually , in Lot Angeles , Mr. Barry saw the demand and met it . The U.S. Government had helped things by forbidding postmasters to remail , as from their own town , letters sent them . ( There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) He opened offices , of which he has three now : Los Angeles , Chicago , and New York . His far-flung field representatives are consuls , government officials , hotel managers , and others , many of whom Mr. Barry met on his travels . And stamp-collectors . " They 're an obliging lot , the philatelists , " Mr. Barry says . He has about thirty thousand mailers listed here and there . One of Mr. Barry 's clients is a young man who got mad at a girl in Los Angeles last fall and announced that he was off forever . He saw Mr. Barry and worked out an itinerary . Mr. Barry enters into the spirit of these affairs . " The boy started out from Seattle , " he told us . He wrote his girl from there . The next letter , a month later , was from Shanghai . " Where is he ? " we asked Mr. Barry . " He 's in Australia now , " he said . " He wo n't be back for another six months . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where is he ? " " Oh , that , " said Mr. Barry . " He 's on a ranch in Nevada . " Another young man went up the Nile , down into Tanganyika , Uganda , th , Belgian Congo , came out on the Gold Coast , and returned to this country via Brazil . Eighteen months for that trip , and all the time the fellow was working in a filling station in Michigan . Another case of a girl . Mostly , Mr. Barry 's customers are commercial concerns . A patent-medicine company in Ohio advertises a New York office . Mr. Barry takes care of that Makers of cosmetics , feminine apparel , etc. , find that a letter with a Paris postmark is persuasive . Mr. Barry has five or six hundred of these regular clients and they 're the backbone of his business . Recently , however , Mr. Barry was able to help out in another personal matter . A radio announcer for a small station out . Vest did n't seem to be getting anywhere . He came East with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arranged with Mr. Barry to mail them from all parts of the country . He got a raise . Hunger THE cover design of this month 's Vanity Fair is a photograph of beer and pretzels . The pretzels play an important part in the picture : they form the words " Vanity Fair . " It was necessary to have them specially baked in the desired shapes . The pretzels which you see on the cover , how ever , are not the original baking ; they are a second set . The first set was eaten by the photographer , who arrived at the studio more hungry than informed . Nobody had told him about the part pretzels were to play in the picture and , finding them on the table , he let his animal nature run away with him and ate them all , in no particular alphabetical order . It caused a delay ( a second set had to he rushed through the bakeshop ) , and was a tense situation . No Animus AGENTLEMAN walking in the East Fifties of a recent evening passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking up and down between a couple of placards that bore slogans urging people not to patronize the theatre because , etc. just as our observer came along , the picketer decided to call it a night . It was pretty near eleven o'clock , anyway . He took off the cards , rolled them up carefully , and tied them with a piece of string . He then handed them to the theatre doorman , to keep for him until the next day . Both smiled in friendliness and the picketer said good night and went home . Not a scrap of ill-feeling .
