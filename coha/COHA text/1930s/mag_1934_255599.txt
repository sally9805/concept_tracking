Early one morning in April 1906 virtually the whole Pacific Coast began to quake . In San Francisco buildings toppled , fires broke out , water pipes parted and the fire chief was killed in his bed . When news of this great disaster reached the late great Edward Henry Harriman in his Manhattan office , he boarded a train , sped West over his own Union Pacific R. R. to place at the disposal of San Francisco 's earthquake victims the entire resources of his railroad empire . That done , his next purpose was to get back to New York in a hurry . He ordered out Union Pacific 's fastest equipment , got on a private train with his secretary , told the engineer to " open her up wide . " The Harriman Special steamed into Manhattan with a coast-to-coast record of 71 hr. 27 min . Last week Railroader Harriman 's 28-year-old transcontinental record was at last smashed and the smasher was none , who , like his father before him , now chairmans the Union Pacific 's board , stepped into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named " E. H. Harriman . " Also aboard were U. P. 's President Carl Raymond Gray , and many an other bigwig . This was no ordinary train ; it was the railroad 's answer to aviation-a sleek streak of canary-yellow speed . <P> Out of Los Angeles slid M-10001 , its Diesel-electric power-plant driving it along at 70 , 80 , 90 m.p.h . Thanks to airconditioning , its passengers felt nothing of Imperial Valley 's heat . Up steep grades of the Rockies M10001 sped at over 50 m.p.h. , shot through the snow-capped passes of the Continental Divide , glided swiftly across the prairies . Between Dix and Potter , Neb. it covered two miles in one minute flat . Never before had a passenger train hit 120 m.p.h. * After a run of 38 hr. 49 min. from Los Angeles M10001 glided smoothly into Chicago 's La Salle Street Station , 20 hours ahead of the fastest regular train schedule on that route . <P> Because of an agreement with New York Central , the U. P. train had to stick to Twentieth Century 's 17-hr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 m.p.h. , it sprinted just once , between Buffalo and Batavia , to touch 112.5 m.p.h. and thereby equal the 41-year-old record of famed Engine No. 999 , hauling the Empire State Express . M10001 cruised at half-throttle through the misty Mohawk Valley , stepped lightly down along the Hudson River to Mott Haven , where it stopped . From that point on it was ignominiously towed into New York by a black , stumpy little electric locomotive ; a state law forbids Diesel-powered engines from using the city tunnels . At Grand Central Terminal M10001 was hailed by Press &; public for the fastest coast-to-coast run ever made on rails-3,258 mi. in 56 hr. 55 min . Son Harriman had beaten his father 's record by nearly 15 hours , clipped a full day from regular transcontinental express time. * <P> Out into the brilliant Klieg lights stepped Engineer H. D. Robinson . With two other engineers he had taken turns at the controls-two hours on , four hours off . The white glare of publicity proved too much for him . Just as he was being presented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to the floor in a faint . <P>
