IN these sounding and furious 30 's one of the topics which has continually called forth at least its due share of sound and fury is the organization of medical service . The term " socialized medicine " has become a fighting phrase . Like most such phrases , it means a variety of things to those who argue . For some it is compulsory health insurance , for others a system of tax-supported medicine in which physicians are employees of the state , for still others merely some variant or development of our present contract practice . The only thing on which the disputants have agreed is that , whatever it is , it is either a panacea for most of the troubles to which the human body is heir or a bogey which is devilishly sure to destroy all the proud gains of medical science . It is not hard to explain the emotionalism of the lay arguers . They feel terribly dependent upon the medical care which most of them find difficult or impossible to pay for . In the frontier stage of American civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do now . Every neighborhood had its midwife . Mothers learned resourcefulness in the presence of croup or accident . Fewer people lived to meet the infirmities of old age . More diseases were regarded as hopeless and therefore something to require resignation to the Divine Will rather than the services of a doctor . Diagnosis was crude , and treatment likely to consist of a few pills and a command to " get lots of sleep and fresh air . " The concept ofpublic health was new and , except for smallpox vaccination , the idea of preventive medicine was scarcely born . By and large , one " had the doctor " only in case of a serious accident or critical illness . The mere statement of this attitude is enough to show how it differs from that of to-day . People have been trained ( largely by the profession itself ) to feel that medical service is a human necessity and that modern medicine has wonderful facilities waiting to be used . The technics of diagnosis and treatment have been improved in so many directions that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical ailment is available if only he has access to it . As the technics have improved they have inevitably become more expensive : it costs more to make X-rays and blood analyses than it does to count a pulse and look at a tongue . Still more important , at least a fraction of the population has now been trained to the belief that in the field of medicine a stitch in time may save not only nine other stitches but sometimes death itself , and so are made resentful when they can not see the way to take that first stitch . I know a young woman suffering from a complaint whose treatment will swallow up most of her annual salary . Recently I heard her fling out , " Surely if there is such a thing as a right , it is the right to keep our bodies up to working efficiency without having to wreck our whole scheme of existence . " Then she burst into a perfect tirade , not against her doctors , for she was grateful to them and felt that for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way medical service is organized . Her attitude is fairly typical . From feeling dependent upon a vitally important service , it is only a step to feeling that the service is a right , and then only half a step to violent personal resentment when the right is obstructed . The progression of feeling may be illogical and it may lead to unfortunate consequences , but it is the way human nature works ? and there is never any point in quarreling with human nature . So long as a majority of American families find a doctor 's bill either something they ca n't hope to pay or something that will entail a nightmare of sacrifice and scrimping they are going to keep on feeling that " something must be done about it . " They may be a bit vague about the precise working-out of " socialized medicine , " but it sounds good to them . Sooner or later , if we may judge by the free schools , free land , old-age pensions , and other facts which Americans once got to thinking of as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That type of emotionalism is not hard to understand . It is as human as the tendency to make oneself comfortable and as American as ham and eggs . Legislators and occupational groups have always had to deal with it and they always will . What is hard to understand is the emotionalism with which organized medicine has met it . Doctors are men of science , not economists or theologians . They do n't argue with disease . They see human nature in its least attractive manifestations and they do n't argue with it . But listen to this : " We have been precipitated into a war to the finish . The final battleground is the county medical society . See to it that each fighting unit is recruited up to wartime strength . See to it that your defenses are solid and your armament complete . Strengthen the personnel of the Public Relations Committee and the Committee on Public Health Legislation . Show the public that yourinterests are their interests . If we go down , let us go down fighting . Let it not be said by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess of pottage , but rather that we stood and fought for the highest quality of medical service it was possible to give the people . " That is no soap-box orator enlivening a street corner , but the Chairman of the Committee on Medical Economics of the Pennsylvania Medical Society . And here is a sentence from an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association : " The problems of medical care have been during the past ten years like a seething volcano , constantly emptying great masses of fire in the form of hastily considered , dangerous schemes and plans which the medical profession and community alike had to avoid or perish . " The language is positively sulphurous . Nor are these isolated examples . One of the most striking facts about the whole controversy is the intensely emotional tone which the leadership of organized medicine adopts in its opposition to any change from the traditional , individualistic , fee-for-service system . Whenever doctors begin to write or speak on " medical economics " they are likely to sound this note of last-ditch fighting against impending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They know that almost a third of American families can not possibly pay the fee and that at least another third find a serious illness or the " run of sickness " which is apt to happen in any family one of the major economic catastrophes of life . They know also that under this system people tend to put off going to a doctor until the trouble becomes severe and perhaps incurable . And they know that even in 1929 a third of American physicians had a net income of less than twenty-five hundred dollars ? not enough to keep up their professional efficiency , and that the percentage is undoubtedly higher now . The medical profession knows and is concerned about these facts , though their distastefulness THE DOCTORS sometimes leads it to play them down in an argument . But , on the other hand , enough impartial studies have been made of the European systems of compulsory health insurance and tax-supported medicine to show that they also have their defects . Rightly or wrongly , most American physicians believe that a system of medicine modeled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political control , increase malingering , and tend to break down the doctor-patient relationship . These are serious charges , which if true would lessen the quality of medical service which the profession can now give those who are able to pay for it . The doctors may be excused perhaps for fearing the imperfections of a medical system they do not know more than those of the system they are used to working with . That sort of conservatism is only human . It is hard , however , to understand their present tactics . Fearing " socialized medicine " as they do , one would expect them to welcome any sort of experimentation with the problem of providing good medical service for low-income groups without benefit of politicians or taxes . In fact , one might expect them to regard a community trying such an experiment as a laboratory and to encourage by every possible means the physicians who are willing to pioneer in such experiments . That would seem to be the reasonable course of procedure for a group of scientifically trained men who saw their profession threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present leadership of organized medicine . What has actually happened has been very different . II Here and there over the country are scattered a series of interesting experiments in group practice and group prepayment ? as distinguished from state medicine ? these are not under state auspices and are not financed by taxation . The form of organization and amount of service offered have varied in different communities , but in every case the aim has been to bring the cost of medical service within the reach of low-income groups . The general method has also been the same : a contract to furnish medical service , usually combined with hospital service , to a large number of families on a prepayment basis . By thus spreading the cost of illness over the year and over a large group of people , most of whom arc much more often well than sick , these pioneering organizations seem to be proving that it is possible for every family above the level of indigence to pay for a good grade of medical care and at the same time free itself from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sick ? " From the professional point of view there are advantages . This type of organization can be made to help solve the sore problem of the relationship of the general practitioner to the increasingly numerous and complex medical specialities . ( I know families who see five or six different specialists more or less regularly , but no doctor knows anything about the family as a whole or even about the individual patient as a physical unit . I have never talked with either a general practitioner or specialist who did not bewail this situation . ) The plan has economic advantages also . The doctors are being paid for working with groups whose care has hitherto been partly or mostly charity work . In all of the organizations I know of the staff physicians are on a salary scale which places them among the more opulent half of their profession , besides being freed from the worry of overhead and collections . Above all , the staff retain absolute control of all the professional phases of the service , so that they can make their relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is a type of organization which if developed and perfected might serve as an alternative to state medicine . Instead , organized medicine has chosen to regard these experiments as " entering wedges " toward state medicine , and has fought them by every weapon which came to hand . One of the best known of these projects is Trinity Hospital at Little Rock , Arkansas . In 1931 , when the depression was beginning to make severe inroads into every physician 's practice , six doctors who had been practicing as a group launched a plan whereby they offered to give practically complete medical care and up to six weeks ' hospitalization on the following pre-payment rates : $2 a month for a person enrolled as one of a group , $2.50 a month for any individual , or $5 a month for a family of any size , with a 10 per cent discount for cash . Immediately such an outcry was raised by the local medical society that the Trinity staff resigned their membership and thus automatically forfeited their membership in the American Medical Association . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special medical societies which doctors prize so dearly . As a group they lost three memberships in the American College of Surgeons , two in the Southern Surgical Association , and three in other societies of this sort . To the physician this is a much worse penalty than it can possibly sound to a layman , for it puts him outside the pale , amounts almost to professional ostracism , and in some cities has been the excuse for denying him hospital facilities , which of course is a tremendous handicap . The Trinity staff had their own hospital . Even so they have had to endure seven years of professional obloquy . Their hospital was denied approval by the American College of Surgeons and was dropped from the hospital list in the directory of the American Medical Association . They were prevented from obtaining liability insurance with some companies and have had to face a boycott directed against the business firms whose employees became subscribers . But in spite of the opposition the organization has grown until it now serves more than 5,000 people , ranging in economic status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ross-Loos Clinic in Los Angeles the opposition was even stiffer . The history of this venture is sufficiently interesting to be worth sketching . Early in 1929 the Los Angeles Bureau of Water and Power approached two excellently trained local physicians , Dr. Donald E. Ross and Dr. H. Clifford Loos , with the request that they organize some sort of a clinic that would provide the 2,000 employees of the Bureau with medical and hospital service on a monthly payment basis . The service was opened in April . Employees of Los Angeles County and the Santa Monica and Los Angeles Fire Departments soon enrolled , so that by December the Clinic had expanded to a staff of eight doctors and almost 4,000 subscribers . It has continued to grow until it now has 65 doctors on the staff and is serving 17,500 subscribers or a total of more than 50,000 people . Among them are oil-field workers , school teachers , various groups of municipal employees , and the faculties of the University of Southern California , University of California , California Institute of Technology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of many of its subscribing groups are proof that the quality of service offered is good . The service rate does not emphasize the family group as it does in Trinity Hospital . The rate is $2 per month to the subscriber , with reduced rates for services to his dependents . For his $24 a year the subscriber is entitled to all his medical and surgical work with the exception of treatment for venereal disease , hypodermic medication , and radium and deep-X-ray treatments . He also receives whatever medicines or drugs are prescribed and up to 90 days ' hospitalization when it is advisable . An idea of the rates available for dependents of subscribers may be obtained from the following : Other charges are in proportion . At first the Los Angeles County Medical Association paid little attention to the new project , but when its success became marked , Drs . Ross and Loos were summarily expelled from the Association for " unethical conduct . " The doctors appealed their case to the California State Medical Society , submitting ample evidence to show that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fee-splitting , and that the staff had been adequately paid . But the State Association upheld the County Association . Then an appeal was taken to the Council of the American Medical Association , which decided that since the doctors had obviously not had a fair trial the County Association must reinstate them in membership . But opposition still continues , and the Clinic must be always on guard against physicians who can not tolerate any change from the feefor-service system , but who are perpetually trembling before the prospect of state medicine . The experience of the Milwaukee Medical Center has been still more bitter . It came into being in exactly the same fashion as had the Ross-Loos Clinic ? in response to a request for service by a group of working people , in this case the employees of the International Harvester Company . It was organized in April , 1936 , and twenty months later had a staff of 7 physicians and a membership of 2,500 or about 7,500 patients . It differs from the Trinity Hospital plan in that it does not provide hospitalization ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ) and from the Ross-Loos Clinic in that the entire family is covered in the service . But it is like both in that the complete administrative control is in the hands of the staff physicians . No layman and certainly no politician has a look-in here . But from the moment of its organization the Medical Center faced savage opposition . Taking a leaf from the book of the Los Angeles County Medical Association , the local Society filed specific charges against the doctors of the Center . This time there would be no reversal on the grounds that the accused did not know what they were being tried for . The charges were : " conduct tending to defeat the purposes of the County Society , " " solicitation and advertising , " " contract practice contrary to sound public policy , " and an attempt to circumvent a recently passed Wisconsin statute permitting only county medical societies to practice contract medicine as they might see fit for the care of indigents and persons in the low-income groups . When the doctors of the Center publicly refuted these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expelled . Their appeal to the State society was denied . Then , just as Dr. Ross and Dr. Loos had done , they appealed to the Council of the A.M.A. Decision on the appeal was delayed for ten months , and when it finally came it upheld the local medical society . Meantime , during the course of the appeals , hospital affiliations were denied the members of the staff in all but two of Milwaukee 's hospitals on the excuse that in order to enjoy the privileges of hospital connections a physician must be a member of the Medical Society ! When the news of the Council 's action reached Milwaukee a few weeks ago there was a small furor . Wisconsin , it must not be forgotten , is Wisconsin ? the home of the La Follettes , advanced social legislation , a lusty co-operative movement , and thoroughly articulate farmers and industrial workers . Altogether it was a very poor scene for the medical societies to choose for action of this sort . Numerous groups found angry voices at once . Organized labor has been especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hospitals are denied it . The story is not all told yet . Nobody can predict just how it will end , but two things at least are sure : The Center got an amount of favorable publicity which should assure its existence , and organized medicine earned for itself an amount of lively popular hatred which probably brings the prospect of state medicine several steps nearer . III From the standpoint of the social scientist the co-operative hospital and health service at Elk City , Oklahoma is extremely interesting , not only because it is the first of its sort but because most students of the problem of making medical service available to all sectors of the population have concluded that in rural areas some form of state medicine is inevitable . Particularly in sparsely settled areas insufficient income is available for the residents to provide their own hospital facilities , specialists , and technicians , or even to attract first-class general practitioners . ( According to the study made by the Committee on the Cost of Medical Care , the average income of rural practitioners is less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The problem of supplying medical service to rural districts has long been a headache for everyone concerned . It would seem that anyone willing to experiment with it in a practical fashion would be considered a benefactor by the medical profession . Elk City is a sun-baked , wind-burned little town of 5,500 down in cotton-growing Southwestern Oklahoma . Like its sister communities in western Kansas , Texas , and Nebraska , it has been plagued with a long series of years of short crops , low prices , and severe dust storms . Financially and geographically it would be hard to find a more unpromising locality for an experiment in group medicine . It had , however , one advantage . Under the sponsorship of the Farmers ' Union a thriving co-operative movement had grown up . The farmers were used to ginning and marketing their cotton cooperatively and buying their farm supplies through consumer co-ops . When in 1929 Doctor M. Shadid , a prominent local physician , proposed to them that they organize a co-operative health service and build themselves a hospital , they were ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares in the Association have now been sold at $50 apiece , and the hospital is seven years old . In the projects at Little Rock , Los Angeles , and Milwaukee both administrative and professional control are vested in the medical staff or the heads of the clinic . The patients enroll , pay their fees , and accept their service . They respect and like their doctor or dislike and finally leave him just as they do in private practice , but they have no direct voice in the organization . At Community Hospital they do . They own the physical property , and all business arrangements are administered by a board of directors elected by and from the membership . Responsibility for all professional phases of the work remains of course with the staff . In spite of every obstacle which Nature , the depression , and organized medicine could put in its way , the project has succeeded . The hospital has twice had to be enlarged and a third addition is in process . The staff now includes five doctors and a dentist . This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better than 90 per cent of whom are farmers scattered over two or three of the thinly-settled counties . For its $2 a month a family is entitled to all its medical and surgical care and laboratory examinations . Its children are immunized for diphtheria and smallpox , and its dental examinations and extractions are free . If one of its number must be hospitalized , the charge is a fiat $2 per day plus a fee for the use of the operating room in surgical cases . Thus an appendectomy costs round $40 , and for about $30 a baby can be ushered into the world in a well-appointed delivery room with the standard pre- and post-natal care for himself and his mother . The members are urged to have annual check-ups , and every one of them I talked with when I visited the place assured me that he seeks medical advice earlier than he ever did " before we got our hospital . " The staff incomes , net because there is no overhead , range from $3,000 to $8,000 . Such is the Hospital itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical societies has been little short of spectacular . At fast the local society was inclined to ridicule the idea that such a hairbrained scheme could be worked out , but when the brick walls began actually to go up the war was on . The Society was allowed to lapse for a time and when it was revived Dr. Shadid was so sure that he would he excluded that he did not bother to re-apply . That of course threw him out of the State and national associations . But the doctors had caught a Tartar . Dr. Shadid has what amounts to a positive genius for controversy . He never misses a trick . The battle of the hospital to exist and of the staff physicians to retain their licenses moved speedily into State politics . " Alfalfa Bill " Murray , then Governor , put in his oar by announcing that he would dismiss the Medical Board if it revoked any Elk City licenses . Newspapers over the State began to play up the story and national magazines to send down writers . Oklahoma farmers recalled all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray was off the scene , the Medical Board refused to renew the temporary license of the eye-earnose-and-throat specialist at Community Hospital , and suddenly four members of the staff decided the battle was lost and left . The remaining three doctors ( under the circumstances it was impossible to recruit a staff ) worked like slaves to carry on . Lawsuits came along . The Medical Board ordered Doctor Shadid to appear and show why his license should not be revoked on charges of " fleecing the public " and " capping and steering " ? this last being Oklahomese for solicitation of patients . This trial involved the existence of the Hospital , because if his license could be revoked , so could that of any other doctor who desired to practice in a similar institution . The right of the Board to try the case was appealed to the State Supreme Court , which finally ruled against the Board . The trial will be conducted sometime next fall in the local District Court , where it is a foregone conclusion that the license will not be revoked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations as Community Hospital ; and the Fanners ' Union , labor unions , and Veterans of Industry countered by trying to get an amendment that would specifically exclude co-operative and non-profit organizations from the steerage provisions . They were originally enacted to catch the quacks who posed as specialists in men 's diseases and hired solicitors to " steer " patients to them ? certainly a very different sort of situation from that of well-trained , reputable physicians engaged in group practice . The legislative fight is still on , but everyone who knows anything about Oklahoma politics believes that sooner or later the Farmers ' Union will have its way . From the point of view of the medical societies the net results of the long strife have been exceedingly son-y . The Hospital has had so much State and national publicity that groups of farmers and villagers all over the nation have heard of it and have begun to ponder the possibility of organizing similar associations . The organized profession has acquired so much ill-will among thousands of ordinary Oklahomans that they would vote for socialized medicine on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a good thing . Worse still , in all the tremendously important future discussion of the merits of various forms of medical organization , these people are going to discount the sincerity of doctors when they speak of their concern lest the quality of medical service be depreciated . IV Perhaps one more illustration is in order . Last year the Home Owners ' Loan Corporation , after a study had showed that illness among its employees was costing it $100,000 annually , set up a co-operative health service called Group Health Association , to serve the employees of the Corporation and other governmental employees who might wish to use it . Individual membership dues were set at $26.40 a year and family membership at $39.60 , or $3.30 a month . For this amount an employee and his family would receive their medical and surgical examinations and treatments , whatever home care should be necessary , their operations and maternity care , and up to 21 days of hospitalization . The organization was closely patterned after Stanacola Employees Medical and Hospital Association , which since 1930 had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered any opposition worth mentioning . In fact , at the very time when Group Health Association was being set up the medical director of the Stanacola group was president of his local medical society . No such calm sailing was in store for the new Association ? perhaps because its potential membership is so large . ( Already employees of the Departments of Agriculture and Justice , the Securities Exchange Commission , and the Bureau of Standards have been made eligible to membership . ) At any rate even before the plan began to operate , the Journal of the American Medical Association ran a long article bitterly attacking it as illegal , as an introduction of the " check-off " system among federal employees , and as a threat to the quality of medical service . Of these arguments the first received most emphasis . The Association was declared to be illegal because , while really an insurance association paying its indemnity in the form of medical and hospital service rather than cash , it had been incorporated under another provision of the District of Columbia Code , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a license . Most of the article is highly legalistic in tone , but near the end there are two sentences in an entirely different vein . In the light of what happened later , they arc most interesting : " In any event , medical service under the Association would be likely to be handicapped by difficulty likely to be experienced in obtaining the best consultant service and hospital accommodations . Physicians who sell their services to an organization like Group Health Association for resale to the patient are certain to lose professional status . " ( Italics mine . ) There was first of all an attempt to block the appropriation of the $40,000 which HOLC sought to allocate for the use of the Association . That failed . The Legislative Council of the Senate held that the Association was legal , and the House Appropriations Committee approved the appropriation . But at about the same time the Corporation Counsel and District Attorney ruled that the new association was illegal . Late in last January Group Health filed a petition with the federal district court asking for a decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fronts . The opposition of the Medical Society was so strong that it became impossible to get together a staff of physicians from Washington . And the hospitals of the district were closed to the physicians who were secured . This of course was a body blow . A doctor who for years had been on the courtesy staff of Emergency Hospital suddenly found himself barred . A patient ready for an operation had to be sent home because his surgeon was on the Group Health staff . More recently , the staff pediatrician was expelled from the District of Columbia Medical Society because he had not secured the Society 's approval of his contract . As I write , the issue is not settled . Presumably if the federal court finds that the HOLC lawyers tripped up and the organization is legally faulty , it will have to be re-incorporated . It may have to buy or build its own hospital . In either case a considerable delay will ensue . Beyond that the medical society will gain nothing ; for if the experience of the last few years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is that when the people really make up their minds they want something , no legal machinery can prevent their getting it . Even the Supreme Court comes to heel . The delay does n't matter . What does matter seriously is the whetting of tempers and the turning of popular suspicion and hatred against the professional class most closely concerned with American health . V The medical societies apparently have not realized the depth of the general feeling that something is wrong with our medical system . The people themselves have not read the reports of the Committee on the Cost of Medical Care , and they do not know that the findings of the California Medical Economic Survey were so disturbing that the California Medical Association felt it best to suppress them . Probably they did not even read the shocking figures assembled by the W.P.A. survey of the nation 's health during the years 1935-36 . They do not know the actual percentage of people who need medical care and are not receiving it . They only know that all about them are ailments which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know actual percentages in order to feel that conditions are unsatisfactory and to bedeeply resentful when an organized profession resists any change from the status quo . Something very like a patients ' revolt is in the making . Within the profession are many individuals who see how bad have been the tactics of opposition . Scores of physicians in good standing are beginning to say openly that the profession must not oppose " valid experimentation in meeting social needs . " At the next annual convention of the A.M.A. these voices will undoubtedly be heard . If they can not soon prevail sufficiently to end the fruitless , senseless opposition to new types of organization the loss to everyone concerned will be serious . The European systems of compulsory health insurance and tax-supported medicine arc far from perfect . But if we get a " socialized medicine " on a wave of popular resentment , especially if it is set up by legislators keeping a weather eye out for its effect on partisan politics , our chances of avoiding the European mistakes are practically nil . We shall be lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American . For that reason we shall in the next few years need popular confidence in the medical profession as we have never needed it . The doctors know this . Why they court popular suspicion and antagonism by fighting experiments in new , nonpolitical forms of organization is almost beyond comprehension .
