Upon hearing that an eyeless baby was born in Washington last week , officials of the Manhattan Eye , Ear &; Throat Hospital revealed that they are building an artificial socket for an artificial eye in the head of a one-eyed baby . Plastic operations began 18 months ago when the baby , a blue-eyed blonde , was 18 months old . Surgeons first slit the skin where her second eye should have been and reamed out a cavity . When this healed , surgeons lined the cavity with mucous membrane taken from the inner surfaces of her cheeks . In the next few days the surgeons expect to give the child eyelashes and blinkable lids by fastening pieces of her eyebrows to the edges of her present , imperfect lids . Next and last step will be the insertion of a little glass eye with a blue iris .
