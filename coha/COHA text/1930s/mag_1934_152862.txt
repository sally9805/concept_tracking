For their record in world competition , Poland may well be proud of her flying sons . Month ago Polish flyers finished first and second in the fourth international air race for sporting planes , beating a field of 31 planes over a 5,900-mi. course through nine European countries . Last week , in the 22nd annual James Gordon Bennett balloon race at Warsaw , Polish flyers took not only the first two places , but the third as well . Winning balloon drifted 830 mi. to Ryazan , U. S. S. R. Chief excitement of the race was furnished by over-zealous Soviet frontier guards who fired at several of the balloons , hit none .
