Ever since electrical engineers found it economical to transmit high voltages of electricity from powerful central stations , they have had trouble handling the goods to be delivered . Simply to turn on and oft a monster current requires monster circuit breakers ( switches ) . For currents of 220,000 volts , switches have had to be as large as water tanks ' on apartment house roofs . It was necessary to immerse the breaker points in an oil bath of high insulating properties to smother the flashing arc when the circuit was broken . Frequently it was necessary to change the oil which was carbonized ( made more conducting ) by each arc . <P> Fortnight ago Siemens Schuckert of Berlin* announced a new switch to handle current up to 600,000 volts without spattering fire . It does not resort to the use of oil baths or air blasts . It operates in a pool of a secret liquid , allegedly far more efficient than oil . <P> * The Siemens Concern , of which Siemens Schuckert is a branch , is Germany 's great electrical equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , steam turbines , generative equipment .
