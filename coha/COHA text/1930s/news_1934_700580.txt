MacCormick , Commissioner of Correction , who appointed him . Dr. Harold Rypins , secretary of the State Board of Medical Examiners , told the magistrate he had been seeking Schneller for five years , and that the accused man had practiced medicine illegally in Minneapolis , Detroit and Toronto . Scars on Schneller 's wrists were said to date back to an attempt at suicide in Minneapolis when he was arrested there . Sol Ullman , deputy Attorney General , testified that Schneller once served a jail term for a similar offense . This statement aroused Schneller . " I am accused of being elusive , " he - houted .

When he was revived he appeared to have lost all interest in the proceedings . Mayor LaGuardia expressed pleasure " with the energetic manner in which Commissioner MacCormick " had dealt with the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor , " is how to get good doctors to live on an island like that for $1,450 a year . I have to pay a plumber $13 a day and a painter $12.50 , and I do n't mind that , but I could n't suggest to any doctor that I know that he take a job like that one for $1,450 a year . Why , that 's only $28 a week . If I mentioned it to the young doctors I know , they would laugh at it . " Another difficulty we have is in getting nurses to work on the islands , but I hope in the next budget to be able to raise these standards somewhat .
