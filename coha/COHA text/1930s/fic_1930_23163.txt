THE SHOWMAN A STORY BY LORD DUNSANY TUN CH was Long over in the Bil- liards Club ; even the desultory teacups of such as took tea stood with tepid brown pools in them , and the warmth of the fire seemed now the principal need in the bleak winter evening . Three members sat on the sofa before the fire , Jorkens was deep in an armchair by the side of it , and others were dotted about in comfortable chairs . That is how I saw them as I came in . Jorkens had a warm corner . It was often his habit to rest after lunch , and he seemed to be still doing so . Talk on the sofa was livelier , perhaps because there they got the most stimulus from the fire : certainly it was a very cold day . And on the sofa was a man telling a story of Africa , of Morocco a long time ago . The story was of no interest ; I merely mention it because of its effect on Jorkens . I really thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story was reached Jorkens was wide awake and listening alertly . That point was the question of rescuing a certain prisoner in one of those barbarous prisons which they had long ago in Morocco , a question which the teller of the story had decided against . He could have quite easily done it ; the commander of the guard had of his own volition offered to cell him his sword , and with a little negotiation would certainly have sold the guard . A prisoner had appealed to him , and he supposed that he could have done it but was held back merely by respect for laws the whole system of which he despised . That was what they were talking about on the sofa : whether he should have rescued a man from barbarous laws or respected the laws merely because they were the laws of that country . Incidentally , the prisoner was confined without food and for a long sentence . He made basketwork out of rushes and if he could sell his baskets to casual sightseers he could buy food and live . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jorkens rushed into the discussion . It was a curious discussion from then on , Jorkens by every suggestion and argument trying to prove that the man was perfectly right to do nothing whatever against the laws , or even the customs , of any country at all , however barbarous , whose hospitality he might have taken by invitation or otherwise . At'first I thought Jorkens wanted to tell a story of his own . But I soon found that he was not arguing against the speaker upon the sofa , but most eagerly for him . And presently I saw that Jorkens had something on his mind , that some old sore on his conscience had been touched . And here he was waking up from his seat by the fire to prove that under no circumstances should you help any man against the customs of the country which was oppressing him , and obviously knowing , all the time , he was wrong . It made a curious argument , and when everyone had agreed that the teller of that story had acted rightly and that Jorkens ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to me that the only interesting residue which remained was the experience that , probably years and years ago , had seared that sore place upon the conscience of Jorkens . So I said , " I suppose you never had any such experience yourself ? " " Well , in a way , yes , " said Jorkens . " It depends on what you call laws . But if you define them as any organized acts arising out of the deep convictions or feelings of any community , well then , of course , I have . And I maintain once more that that view of the case is perfectly just . " Well , we were all agreed about that , and I saw that Jorkens , for all he said , really felt the exact opposite , so there seemed nothing more to argue about . But I wanted the story . " When was that ? " I asked . " Oh , a while ago , " replied Jorkens . " Waiter ! " I said . He knew what I wanted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him , was sitting up in his chair , telling this story . " I was in a small town in France , down in the Midi , and a traveling show had arrived the night before , a bit of a circus and rows of cages on wheels . And I idled in during the afternoon to take a look at their zoo , for it was quite a zoo that they had in their cages  --  a lion , several apes , and all sorts of things . " " What were you doing in the Midi , Jorkens ? " said someone from an armchair ; and a reminiscent look settled deep upon Jorkens ' eyes , and it took me some while to get him back to thestory I wanted to hear . And when I did get him back he was telling us how he stood in front of one of the cages , trying to make friends with an ape , an animal with brown eyes , friendly and intelligent as a dog and yet almost sulking . " Not sulking exactly either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natured person with some perfectly obvious grievance . I tried to hand him a nut , and he would not take it at first . When I scolded him about it he reached out a hand lazily as much as to say , ' Oh , very well . ' But all the time , by his attitude , his gestures , the look in his eyes , he seemed to be expressing one thing , which if he had had the power of speech would have been something like , ' If you really must shut us up like this . ' " A man had walked up to the cage and stood beside me without my knowing he was there , till all of a sudden he spoke to me . ' Fine ape that , ' he said . " When I looked round I saw beside me a man in a frock coat and tall hat , stoutish , ruddy-complexioned , fairly tall , and with a large , slightly grizzled mustache rather carefully waved ; he had a gold watch-chain , a bright red tie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but smoking was not allowed in the long tent in which the cages were , and he had a gold cigar-ease in his left hand . I said ' Yes ' rather grudgingly to his remark about the poor ape . And he replied , ' You wo n't see a finer one of its kind in any show . ' " From that we got to arguing . Of course I saw that he was the showman . But all the more on account of that I expressed the view which 1 saw so clearly in that ape 's eyes . There were so many of these apes shut up in those cages , and I thought it was rather a shame . That was my side of the argument . His was , first that he was a showman , and the public wanted apes ; " 1 said that when they were free they could go where they liked ; and he said that they saw much more of the world going about as they did with him . For it seemed that he had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his show from England to meet them and was showing his way back across France . " I said something about their home , and he said that animals like that did n't have those sorts of feelings . One place , to them , was just as good as another . " Of course the more he said things like that the more I argued , and the more he argued in return . But it was n't any good my arguing because he never really thought about the apes at all ; he thought only of the public . He had the showman 's point of view , and nothing else in Iife mattered to him . Wherever he had appeared some waiting crowd had risen to greater intensity . He and his show were the stimulants that made eyes shine and pulses beat quicker : it was for this that he lived . So that to suggest that apes should not be shown to the crowds which he loved was every bit as bad to him as it would be to a dean if one casually suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I got my point of view , looking at that poor ape with the injured look in his eyes , and you see why he disagreed with me . Of course at the time my point of view and his each seemed to the other quite crazy . But , for all that , we saw a good deal ofeach other for the next day or two , till his show moved on . You see , my argument did n't seriously annoy him , because , outrageous though it appeared to him , he could n't believe that my point of view was a real one . The show was real ; human beings enjoying themselves were his normal standard ; anything opposed to that was merely fantastic . So he invited me into his circus and introduced me to his little troupe . And I must say that if I 'd lived long in that atmosphere I , too , after a year or so should have found myself placing the show before everything and forgetting the lost liberty of the elephant and the apes . In and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half , with nothing else to do , I at last began to see how he came by the views he held . But I was not long enough there to agree with them . And that was what the whole trouble was about . " " Who was he ? " I asked . " Fromer , " he said . " It was a long time ago , and will probably convey nothing to you . " Which was perfectly true . But I do not doubt Jorkens ' story on that account ; his sincerity was too unmistakable . He was turning over old facts in his mind , speaking aloud as he did it , trying to reconcile himself with what he had done , trying to make it all right and knowing , as he had known for years , that it was all wrong . " But what a personality he was . As I sat at tea with his troupe of five in their tent at the back of the circus-tent , he would walk in ; and everyone was aware of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Fromer stood in the tent , with his tall hat on as always and his cigar in his mouth , motionless and silent , yet the immediate center of interest . And after some moments ' thought he would say , ' Well , boys . ' Then he would probably say , ' Well , girls . ' There was nothing much in his words ; he could n't be called a deep thinker ; and yet he was one of those dominant characters that is the greatest man in the room wherever he is . I do n't know how it 's done . " Well , that 's the sort of man he was , anyway . With human beings , that is . But he never got that sort of hold over the apes . Perhaps it was really because the audiences knew that he loved them and would do anything for them . I do n't know what the apes knew . " Well , his show left Orignan one bright morning , and it was n't the same place at all without him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then one day there came to me in London , quite suddenly , walking down Mungle Street , a craving for the South and the sun , for lands where there is no pavement and where there are very few paths . And when that feeling comes on one I find it is n't a question of whether one can afford it , or if one can spare the time , or anything else : Africa 's calling , and off one goes . Well , I went . And in Loin Molo , the very first day I arrived , I got unmistakable news of Fromer . A man in a tall hat had gone through Lob Molo with fifty cages on wheels only a few weeks earlier . There was no doubt it was Fromer . You see fifty cages on wheels would attract some attention anywhere , but a tall hat in that part of Africa was simply marvellous , and hundreds had flocked to see it . So I was easily able to identify Fromer : if one mau could n't remember his red tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another his frock coat , and all remembered his cigar . He was after apes . Fifty of them he wanted to get . And they told me in Lob Mob all about his cages , though of course they were more interested in his hat and his clothes . Each cage was simply a trap : the whole front lifted up , and when the ape walked in to get the fruit that would be put there Fromer merely let it down with astring , and each env , , padlock and lockeaY/ locksmith in Lob Mob4 all about it , because one locks had got out of order made one to replace it . Then chanced to tell me that they all locks with the same key , or unlocked rather , for they locked themselves when they fell , just like the hasp of a padlock . And I remembered that later when we were talking at the club which they have there . Everyone was against Fromer , and they were all saying that he was taking too many apes out of Africa . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee-planters mostly , and hearing them all say the same thing for an hour , I decided , rightly or wrongly , that I would go after Fromer and rescue one poor brute from his cage . If I was wrong at all , that was the beginning of it , the first step , driven on by these men 's arguments , and perhaps a glass or two , and by a feeling I had very strongly that the next time I saw an ape in a cage and it looked reproachfully at me , as the one at Orignan had done , I could look back at it unashamed . It was that as much as anything that made me go again to the locksmith and ask him if he had n't got a key to fit the lock that he had made for Fromer . And , seeing that opinion in Loin Molo was so pro-ape , I told him straight out why I wanted it . And he gave it me like a shot , for a couple of pounds . " Then I got twenty natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters , and away I went after Fromer , who with his tall hat and his cigar and his fifty cages was a good deal more easily traced than a herd of elephants . Well , we came up , in three days , with his camp , and I sent a native into it to find out what was going on . And the report was that all the cages except one were in the camp and were empty , but that the Bwana with the magical hat , as his men called him , combining something of the strangeness of his hat with his forceful personality , had gone with one cage into the forest and had been away a long time . So I took one of my men who was a tracker and we followed that cage , where two of Framer 's men had pushed it into the forest and left it with Framer . " It was a great place for apes . We saw them suddenly , in the sun on a hillside . And never did I see anything that so changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ; they give a curious touch of nightmare to it . All the apes looked at me together and then went slowly away , as though they had some secret in the forest that I knew nothing about . " Then we entered the dark of the forest , following the wheel-tracks , but presently I got a view from a small cliff , with all the trees stretched out for miles before me , bright green with blue shadows ; and in a small clearing a mile away was the cage . With my glasses I made out the name of Fromer clearly , in white capitals on the roof . I sent the tracker back to the camp then and went on alone : I did n't want any witness to the freeing of Framer 's ape ; one never quite knows the law unless one 's a lawyer , and it might he theft for all I knew . I sent the man away , and never did I miss anyone 's companionship so much . For there seemed something odd about the forest . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me and gone away to the trees . It was so strangely unlike any expression I 'd seen on the poor beast in the show at Orignan . It was exactly as if they had something in the forest that they knew I knew nothing about . Of course in a country like Africa one gets strange fancies sometimes , especially if you happen to take a drink or two on top of a bout of malaria  --  whichis when you think you most want it . But I had no malaria on me that day , and I had had nothing to drink barring absolute necessities , and yet that odd feeling I had when I saw the apes was as strong as any idea I 've ever felt . " I put it away from me as well as I could and went on , but I could n't help noticing that the little monkeys were watching me then , and in a rather impudent way , as though they were losing their fear of man . They came altogether too close and  --  well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for everything seemed different , and in much more subtle ways than I am able to tell you ; but at any rate it is sufficient to say that there could be no mistake whatever that those gray monkeys thought they were quite my equals . I 'd read that in time of great fires or abnormal drought all kinds of animals crowd together ; but what could account for this contemptuous equality with man I never got anywhere near with my wildest guesses . And in the end it was quite simple . " Well , I went on through that unnatural scene , with all the monkeys looking curiously at me , until I got near the cage and saw that the great apes were about . I did n't expect them to come for me , and yet their attitude seemed so curious and sinister that I would not trust them , and kept out of their sight and went stalking round to Framer 's cage through covert . " The first thing I saw was that the front of the cage was not sticking up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out with my glasses already , when I saw Fromer 's name on the roof ; now it was unmistakably down . ' He 's caught some poor brute , ' I thought . Then I began to scout round to see where Fromer was . It was a curious scouting , for I did n't want either side to see me . But I could n't find Framer . " The apes were awfully close to the cage , and I did n't at all like the looks of them , so my progress was very slow . After half an hour of crawling through papyoona scrub . . . " " Through what ? " said Morden . " Papyoona , " said Jorkens . " After going for half an hour through it I suddenly looked through a branch of pendulous leaves right into the cage . There were apes between me and it , walking by and looking at it , and I was looking over their shoulders straight at Fromer . Yes , he was in the cage smoking a pipe , a thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that that he must have been there sometime and that his cigars had given out . I hid again till the apes in front had gone by , and then I put up my head and whistled to Framer . ' Do n't say a word , ' he said . And I did n't , and all the talking was done by him . He did n't look straight at me , and the apes never made out whom he was talking to . He was in his tall hat and his frock coat and red tie with white spots , everything as usual except the cigar ; but somehow he had n't impressed the apes as he had always impressed human audiences , for they bad caught him , possibly pulling the string by accident while Fromer was putting in finishing touches . He never told me exactly how it happened ; but once they had got him they knew what they were about and were feeding him on bananas . They even got water for him when he passed out a small tray sideways , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ape between them ; and sometimes , of course , it rained . " And then Jorkens told us all the things that Fromer said about the apes . But what may sound all right in a tale at a club does n't look so well in print . It was absurdly exaggerated in any case , even when one has made all allowances for a man caught like that in a cage ; even when one has understood that it must be especially annoying to a showman . It does no good to repeat it . One thing he said a great deal about was their looks . " And attacks like that , " as Jorkens rightly said , " are merely vulgar . But after a while we got back to our old argument , so far as one can call it an argument when only one man is talking , and the other can only shake his head or occasionally point a finger ; and that was all that I was able to do , for fear that the apes would hear inc . And if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a rifle  --  one does n't walk in those forests without one  --  and then there was Fromcr 's rifle lying close to the cage ; but two rifles would have been of no use to me ; there were crowds of those apes . And they all came and gazed again and again at Fromer . It made Fromer furious , but it was perfectly obvious that there was some sort of holiday among them ; he must have seen the same thing thousands of times at his show . But of course I could n't explain that to him without being able to speak , and with the mood he was in I doubt if he 'd have understood if I had . " Well , he began by assuming that I was going back at once to collect a lot of men with rifles to shoot the apes , and then to let him out with his key which he had in his pocket but with which it was impossible for him to get at the locks . They were much too far down on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusing the apes again and restarting that very argument that had annoyed me in Orignan much more than I appear to have annoyed him . He said that of course one must have apes in cages . That statistics showed that they lived longer there than in forests . That they were quite as happy living in cages ; that they merely got more of it by living longer . More happiness because more time for it . One point I made upon my side : I pointed at him in his cage . I pointed so violently that he understood me . Of course he was furious . Putting a man in a cage was a mere piece of apish freakishness , an utterly useless absurdity , a thing no sane man in his senses , and so on . But apes in a cage served a zoological purpose , instructed the young , furthered the cause of science , gave innocent enjoyment on holidays . It was then that I tried to point out that the apes were having their holiday , but I could n't make that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind with fury to see it . And so the argument went on , he having it all his own way , because I could n't speak . Well , when he 'd finished arguing with me he gave me my orders . I was to get enough men to shoot every ape in that part of the forest , and then he was going on to fill his fifty cages elsewhere . But before anything else happened he wanted to look like a showman again . He must meet his rescuers , and show himself to the apes for the last time , with a cigar and a fresher tie and a clean collar . do that for you , ' I said by nods . I wonder if he guessed anything from that . " I promised to do that for him and I kept my promise . I went back to Lobo Mob() and bought him ten dozen white collars and a few bright red ties with spots on them and three or four thousand cigars , and got back to the show that he so involuntarily gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still about , though a little way off , and from the punyabi leaves where I hid I was able to throw them on to the top of his cage , and the cigars fell easily through . " " I thought you said it was papyoona scrub , " said Morden . " It 's practically the same plant , " said Jorkens . " The cigars fell through and so did the ends of the ties , but the collars were the difficulty , and he had to jump for them and get hold of an end and pull . Collars are often a nuisance anywhere , England or Africa . He could n't understand why I brought him so many cigars . But I had worked it all out . It was the winning point in the argument  --  the argument that was taught me at Orignan by that poor ape with its brown eyes . I tried to think of the very least time in that cage that could possibly satisfy justice . Here we were in the apes ' country , and they had shut this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was I to interfere and overturn their act of justice ? Well , I decided to , but not for five years . They fed him , and I got him cigars enough to keep him going for all that time , and white collars and ties , which he set so much store by . Two dozen collars a year may not seem very much , but Africa 's not . England , and you have different standards of smartness . " Of course Fromer was utterly furious . But did he think I never meant a word that I said , from the time I first met him in Orignan ? I had given him warning enough . He knew which side I was on in this matter of cages , or only the blindest vanity could have caused him to fail to know . " There is not much more to tell . His men had scattered when he did n't return to his camp . His forty-nine cages are , I believe , there to this day , though of course all buried in greenery . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to more than one authority in Lobo Mole . But they could n't find him then . What happened I never knew . Perhaps the apes took him farther into the forest . And if they did they may have in their keeping still a man who will never in life depart from the one idea that it is his mission to show on holidays great numbers of apes in cages . " Well , well , we all make mistakes . " And I think Jorkens included his own with the showman 's . I think he knew , as is so often the essx : in an argument , that they were both of them wrong .
