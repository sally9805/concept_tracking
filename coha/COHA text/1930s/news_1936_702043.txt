txt Anomalies in Spain What is a reasonable person to make of the events now taking place in Spain ? Every one knows that force and violence are the prerogatives of Communists and other radicals . Yet here we have the unusual spectacle of an armed uprising on the part of those who believe in the old order of things . The Fascists and Monarchists were badly beaten in the recent Spanish elections and refused to abide by the decision of the voters . Again , it is common knowledge that the country that likes to meddle in the affairs of other nations , seeking by crafty methods the overthrow of friendly government , is Russia . Yet in Spain today it is Italian planes that come to the assistance of the Spanish rebels ; German warships that run " interference " for rebel shore defenses , while the noble brow og many a Spanish Fascist is adorned by a German steel helmet . All this is enough to upset any one with an orderly mind . GEORGE II . MILLER . Tompkinsville , S. I. , Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
