" Have you ever traveled under a false passport ? " <P> " I have . " <P> When the U. S. Communist Party 's general secretary and No. 1 front man , crook-mouthed Earl Browder , so testified to the Dies Committee last September , he put himself in danger of a second Federal imprisonment . ( In 1917 he was jailed as a conscientious objector to World War I. ) Last week the possibility of a second term for Earl Browder , and imprisonment for many another big-name Communist , was brought measurably nearer by the U. S. Department of Justice . <P> First hint that something unpleasant was a-brewing for Browder &; Co. came via the Republican National Committee 's alert publicity man , Franklyn Waltman . In the name of Republican Congressman ( and Dies Committeeman ) John Parnell Thomas of New Jersey , Mr. Waltman handed the following poison-ivy bouquet to Attorney General Frank Murphy : " Our dynamic attorney general , who has been so enthusiastically and tirelessly swooping by airplane all over the country in pursuit of lesser violators of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of Browder . . . . Even Browder must be surprised , perhaps slightly contemptuous . . . . " Thereupon a spokesman for Frank Murphy replied : " It obviously seems to be a curious coincidence that the Republican National Committee issues a statement tonight . . . . The facts are that the department has been actively preparing this case and others . . . and that it expects decisive action in a few hours . " <P> Next day Earl Browder was indicted by a Manhattan Federal Grand Jury on two counts , charged with false swearing in 1937-38 passport applications . Maximum penalty on conviction : Five years in prison , $2,000 fine , on each count . Tears of anger and chagrin in his eyes , he pleaded not guilty , was held in $7,500 bail , as the Grand Jury dug into still more evidence of Communist travel habits . Possible was the bagging by Frank Murphy of such Reds as Executive Committeeman Max Bedacht , Publisher Alexander Trachtenberg . And no one could reasonably complain that prosecution for criminal fraud endangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
