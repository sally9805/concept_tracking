( See front cover ) <P> With his bags all packed and his steamer passage to the U. S. engaged , Premier Paul van Zeeland of Belgium last week pushed through his Parliament 's lower house a bill granting amnesty to those Flemish separatists still in jail or suffering loss of civic rights as a result of negotiating with the enemy during the German occupation . <P> The Flemish-speaking Belgians who demand separation from the rest of their tiny country are a pain in the neck to most Belgian politicians . The fact that Premier van Zeeland has determined to make peace with them has considerable bearing on his visit to the U. S. and the reasons for it . <P> " An amnesty is not rehabilitation , " he explained last week , " and not a pardon . It merely means to forget the past and let bygones be bygones . " <P> Several weeks ago at a White House press conference , newshawks brought up the subject of Premier van Zeeland and his visit to the U. S. President Roosevelt exhibited an expression of bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " As far as I know , " said he , " Mr. van Zeeland is simply coming to this country to get a degree from Princeton . Of course if he should come to Washington , I would be very glad to see him . " Not for an instant did Washington wiseacres believe it was as simple as all that . They are firmly convinced not only that Premier van Zeeland has an ulterior motive in coming to the U. S. to get his honorary degree from Princeton , but that President Roosevelt is responsible for bringing him . Vaguely , but with conviction , the wiseacres talk about the Oslo Group . <P> Oslo Group . Because the Scandinavian nations speak nearly the same language , share the same royal family and were most ardently bound to neutrality during the War , they formed instinctively a tight little group that talked and voted alike during the early years of the League of Nations . Instinctively Baltic Finland joined them and also the Low Countries , Belgium , The Netherlands , minuscule Luxembourg . Nothing very practical was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all except Finland met in Oslo , Norway to try nothing more elaborate than a mutual tariff agreement . Main trouble was that the best individual customers of all these countries were Germany and Britain , no parties to the original Oslo Convention . When the grand World Economic Conference fizzled out in 1933 , the Oslo Convention as an actual agreement was virtually forgotten . But because all the Oslo countries save Belgium were bound by no military alliances and pledged to neutrality in any coming war , the Oslo Group continued voting and thinking alike at international conferences . During the Ethiopian crisis in particular they cooperated with Finland and Switzerland , became known as " The League 's Conscience . "
