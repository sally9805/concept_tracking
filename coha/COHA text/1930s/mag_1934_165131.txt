In Oklahoma last week were 15 assorted Democrats who wanted to be the State 's next Governor. * Primary voting had hardly started before three candidates drew away from the rest of the field . <P> One was Ernest Whitworth Marland . As a Pittsburgh law clerk he watched the Mellons found their fortune . In 1908 he emigrated to Oklahoma , struck oil on one Willie-Cries-For-War 's land , piled up a $65,000,000 fortune , built Ponca City , married his ward when his wife died , gave his State Bryant Baker 's " Pioneer Woman , " and then went bankrupt . He always felt that he had been euchred out of control of his Marland Oil Co. by unscrupulous financiers and when in 1932 he was elected to Congress , he kept up a steady racket against " the wolves of Wall Street . " His gubernatorial platform : " A New Deal for Oklahoma , " a State police system . State subsistence homesteads , wildlife conservation . <P> Grey , gangling Governor William Henry ( " Cocklebur Bill " ) Murray , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tom Anglin , Speaker of the State House of Representatives . <P> Also ahead of the ruck was a candidate with an astonishing record . He was John C. ( " Iron Jack " ) Walton . Engine driver for Mexican President Porfirio Diaz in revolutionary times , he and a jazz band in 1922 got a larger majority of votes for Governor than had ever before been received . Thereupon " Iron Jack " became embroiled in a Ku Klux Klan scandal and was thrown out of office for corruption ten months after he was inducted . In spite of a mail fraud indictment three years ago , a repentant citizenry elected him State Corporation Commissioner . <P> In just that order the picturesque field of candidates finished . Oilman Marland got 146,000 votes ; Speaker Anglin. 95,000 ; Commissioner Walton , 81,000 . A run-off primary was avoided and the Governorship was practically handed to Mr. Marland when Candidate Anglin withdrew . Growled " Cocklebur Bill " Murray : " I 've often said that men would take a cussing or a cold or a rail off your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voters refused my advice . " <P> *No Republican has ever been Governor of Oklahoma .
