txt Efforts of the nation 's railroads to secure Interstate Commerce Commission approval of freight rate increases estimated to yield upwards of $450.000,000 annually will have the backing of railroad labor . competing forms of transportation and some large shippers . This was learned yesterday as rail officials put the finishing touches on their petition for a blanket 15% rate boost which will be formally filed with the ICC before the end of the week . It is understood that both the non-operating and operating groups of railroad labor , which recently received wage rises of 5 and 51-i cents an hour respectively , will formally intervene with the Interstate Commerce Commission in support of the carrier 's petition . The higher wages granted the rail employes added approximately $135,000,000 annually to operating expenses . Truckers ' Petition Regional truckers associations are prepared to follow the lead of the rails and seek Commission approval of a 15% increase in truck rates . Such action would definitely eliminate the threat that motor competition would undercut the desired higher rail charges . The truckers ' rate application is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails . Action probably will be taken by the middle of next week by groups carrying around 85i ; I , of the truck merchandise in the United States . The local truckers also are expected to adjust upward their rates in line with the over-theroad carriers . The truckers ' petition will exclude from the 15% increase those commodities which the railroads plan , to exempt in their application . In addition , the motor carriers will not ask higher rates on coal , sand , gravel and a few similar commodities . Steamship Support Likely The active support of intercoastal and coastal steamship lines also now seems assured particularly since costs of the water lines also have increased substantially in the last two years . In this respect , - it is pointed out that some of the ocean steamship freight rates have been increased as much as 40% to meet their rising expenses .. The only transportation group which so far does not seem to have been brought into line in raising the general level of freight rates to maintain present competitive conditions , are the barge lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by government subsidy and to be placed on a paying basis would have to increase rates substantially above present levels . Any prospect of accomplishing this remains doubtful , rail circles believe . Also , it is understood that the large steel corporations , who together with soft coal pro ' ducers have been the principal objectors to any increase in freight rates in the past , have expressed a willingness to go as far as to appear before the ICC in support of the rails ' plea . This promise of favorable action is based on the supposition that the existing differentials between various sections of the country and different mills will be maintained at their present basis even though rates genI erally are raised by 15% . Security Owners In addition to the groups adding the weight of their support to the railroads ' petition . it is planned to obtain the testimony of other interested parties , including representatives of railroad stockholders and bondholders as well as well-known public figures who would appear before the Commission pointing out the rising rail costs and the necessity for higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonnage carried by the rails in the past few years has increased sharply above the depression low-point. that the revenue per ton mile has been constantly reduced by a whittling away at rates during the past seven years . Opposition to the higher rates is expected to develop from farm territories and from political sources who always have objected to increase in freight rates and who have caused a reduction in rates on agricultural commodities over a period of years . However . the rails feel that they will have the support of ? he great bulk of shippers , particularly the shippers of large tonnages . Although possible action by the Interstate Commerce Commission is as yet unpredictable , railroad officials are hopeful that action will be taken quickly by the Commission em that plans can be made for the future . In line with the decision of Southern Pacific to purchase some 75.000 tons of rail , it is believed that if the ICC hands down a decision quickly on this rate case that further purchases of rail will be forthcoming , particularly since in the latter part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved by the carriers requires the replacement of trackage . The same , it is held , is also true of need for new equipment .
