Pundit Dorothy Thompson ( Mrs. Sinclair Lewis ) , whose first husband was Budapester Josef Bard , wrote last week of the Austrian situation : " Yesterday it looked as though the struggle was over , and the new peace dictated . Today it is still an armistice . Tomorrow ? ... " <P> All who , like Miss Thompson , had quaked with fear lest Nazi Germany had swallowed Austria , were last week highly delighted to hear Austria in the person of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg talking back to Adolf Hitler . Through a cheering crowd of 40,000 Viennese , Schuschnigg drove to the Austrian Diet to deliver a speech which made him the hero of Central Europe . <P> Part of the supposedly humiliating agreement which Hitler forced on Austria was that Schuschnigg would order Austrian stations to broadcast Hitler 's Reichstag speech last fortnight , but the Austrian simultaneously forced the Fiihrer to agree to order German stations to broadcast Schuschnigg 's speech last week . The result was that German radio listeners heard the least Nazi political speech broadcast by the big German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adolf Hitler himself was late for a public appointment because he had lingered by his radio set listening to Kurt von Schuschnigg . Next day scores of congratulatory messages signed by Germans ( many of them round robins ) reached Orator Schuschnigg from Germany . <P> Not once in his address did the Austrian Chancellor mention the Fuhrer by name although he referred in eulogistic terms to Benito Mussolini , who originally advised Schuschnigg to go and bargain with Hitler . He firmly announced that the German Government had engaged itself to respect the political and territorial independence of the Austrian State . Then he added , " Austria will stand or fall with her special German mission ! Austria has declared herself to be a German State . " In words not pleasing to the ears of pagan , Jew-baiting , Communist-hating Nazis , the Chancellor continued : " We are a Christian State , a German State and a Free State-and in this country everyone is equal before the law . . . . Not all the workers who joined the Revolution of Socialists in 1918 should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new slogan : True till death to the Red , White and , Red ! . . . The will to freedom of the Austrian people stands like a strong wall . . . . Victory is beyond doubt . " <P> Upon emotional , freedom-loving French legislators the words of Orator Schuschnigg had galvanic effect . Everyone was quoting him in the lobbies of the French Chamber next day . His speech was an important factor in swinging the 439-10-2 vote of the Chamber promising that the French Army would help , if necessary , to maintain Austrian independence . <P> Meantime intrepid Herr Schuschnigg himself presided at a conference of Austrian police authorities . Present was Interior Minister Dr. Arthur Seyss-Inquart , the only Nazi yet forced by the Fhrer into the Austrian Cabinet . Silent , embarrassed , sat Dr. Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor Schuschnigg ordered the police of Austria to continue the bans against : shouting " Heil Hitler ! , " appearing in brownshirt Nazi uniform , or holding any sort of political meeting in Austria except those of his Fatherland Front ( to which Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
