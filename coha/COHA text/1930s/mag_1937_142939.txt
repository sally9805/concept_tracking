A precept which black , benign Major J. ( " Father " ) Divine , Harlem cultist , enjoins upon his followers is that all stolen goods should be returned to their rightful owners , all old debts be paid to creditors . Since Father Divine attained a following many a U. S. merchant , especially in the South , has testified that many a black man 's long-forgotten debt has indeed been liquidated . In Harlem last week one Famaca Real , a Divine follower , took pen &; paper , laboriously composed a letter . She had once purchased goods on credit in Pittsfield , Mass. , could no longer recall the merchant 's name . So to all the shop-keepers of that city Famaca Real wrote asking that one Sezar get in touch with her . Said she : <P> " I am asking you reply so as to pay my former bill . I want to pay it as Father Divine says pay to Sezar what belongs to Sezar and to God what belongs to God . ' ' * <P> <P> *Said Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which are Caesar 's , and unto God the things that are God's. - Matthew 22:21.
