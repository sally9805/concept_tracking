When Adolf Hitler marched into Austria year ago " His Most Apostolic Majesty " Otto von Habsburg , 26-year-old pretender to the Austro-Hungarian throne , entered objections . Blustering Field Marshal Hermann Goring answered the objections by calling the Archduke " this comic boy . " Nazi Administrator Josef Brckel dubbed him " Otto the Last . " The Nazi police issued a warrant for his arrest for high treason should " His Majesty " ever be caught in Reich territory . Otto remained in Belgium , where he has lived with his mother , onetime Empress Zita , for the last nine years . Last week in Paris , after Fhrer Hitler had seized several more big slices of the Pretender 's " empire " ( Bohemia , Moravia , Slovakia ) , Archduke Otto was still more indignant . Said " His Most Apostolic Majesty " : " I condemn with the utmost energy the violence with which Germany has subjugated Bohemia and Moravia . I condemn also the military occupation of Slovakia by a German Army . . . . More than ever I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Socialist regime . "
