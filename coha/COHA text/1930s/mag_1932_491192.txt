iN THE spring of 1917 the star of Germanity was overcoming . " It can not be said , " wrote General Pershing in his Final Report , " that German hopes of a final victory were extravagant , either as viewed at that time or as viewed in the light of history . Financial problems of the Allies were difficult , supplies were becoming exhausted and their armies had suffered tremendous losses . Discouragement existed not only among the civil populations but throughout the armies as well . " The financial case was desperate . The Allies were staring at the end of their credit . In March , before the United States had embraced the war , the American Ambassador to Great Britain sent a letter home to his brother , saying : " My staff and I are asking everybody what the Americans can best do to help the cause along . The views are not startling , but they are interesting .. Jellicoe : More ships , merchant ships , any kind of ships . Balfour : Credits in the United States big enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Same thing . The military men : An expeditionary force , no matter how small , for the effect of the American flag in Europe . " What Balfour meant by credits enough to keep up the rate of exchange was anything to support the exchange value of the British pound sterling , or , that is to say , its buying power in other countries  --  most importantly its buying power in the markets of the United States . Credit  --  American credit  --  meant more food , more supplies , more munitions , even the ships Jellicoe wanted . Credit meant everything but man power , and the problem of man power was yet less acute than the problem of credit . A small expeditionary force , if only a regiment , to take the American flag to the front for its effect on their morale  --  yes , that was very desirable . But first of all , credit . In a book entitled The Inter-Ally Debts , by Harvey E. Fisk , published by the Bankers Trust Company of New York in 1924 , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies ' credit : " During the first part . of the war , Great Britain was hanker for the Allied powers . She financed her dominions first , then France . Then she joined with France in financing Russia , and later on , when Italy came out on the side of the Allies , she helped Italy to obtain needed commodities . As it was necessary to go to America . for many of the goods required , and as America insisted on being paid in real values , or , if she gave credit , in being well secured for her advances , it was necessary to obtain gold and good convertible securities for the purpose . Therefore , Great Britain , in consideration for the use of her good offices and banking and trade facilities to obtain goods from America , insisted that Russia , France and Italy should send to the Bank of England all the geld that they could spare from their banking reserves . In 1915 , France and England joined their credit to place a great . loan for 8500,000,000 in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , American bankers required collateral . The Borrowers England and France ' appealed to Iheir peoples for loa ns of negot in ble securi ties . These were furnished in great . amounts , largely in the form of American railroad stocks and hands and the bonds of neutral countries . Some of these stocks and bonds were sold in the American market . Other securities were deposited in New York with t he Bankers Trust Company or the Guaranty Trust Company , to protect English and French notes , $120 of collateral being deposited for every $100 lent . The securities forming this collateral were borrowed from their owners by the French and English governments . Their owners received interest-bead rig receipts which entitled them to receive the interest as collected and an additional percentage for their use . " T he quotation continues : " By their own admission , at the time we came into the situation , the Allies were at their wit 's end to know ? which way to turn in order to obtain needed supplies . When the United States opened her pocketbook all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended the war . We supplied in almost unlimited volume the munitions required to enable the Allies to go on fighting while we were enrolling and training men . When the Armistice was signed we had all but . 2,000,000 men in France . Within six months we would have had twice that number there . To conserve shipping to get these men across , we bought went quantities of munitions in Europe . We paid higher prices for these goods than we would have needed to pay at home , even with the cost of ocean transportation added , but it was better to do this and save shipping for the men . " On April 6 , 1917 , the United States entered the war , as an associate , not as an ally . This distinction was jealously maintained to the end of the war , through the Armistice period and at the Peace Conference . Four days later the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee introduced in Congress the first Liberty Loan Act with these words : " This bill contains the largest authorization of bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body in the history of the world . " It authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to harrow $5,0oo , on0 , on ? on the credit of the American Government ; and of this incredible sum of $. - ono , 00rwoo to he raised at once by the sale of Liberty Bonds , three-fifths was for the purpose of buying at par the bonds of foreign governments at war with Germany . That was the credit the Allies were in desperate need of ; and that was the beginning of the war debts . Within two weeks the bill was passed . The Stream of Gold Starts Flowing HE first advance could not . wait on the prepara- tion and sale of Liberty Bonds . The United States Treasury borrowed money on its own notes to make the initial loan to Great Britain . The event was described in the current news as follows : " A loan of 5200,000,000 by the United States to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was consummated on April twenty-fifth with the handing over to Lord Cunliffe , Governor of the Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury , of a treasury warrant for that amount . The money to make the loan was obtained by our Government out of i he proceeds of i he sale of Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness due June thirtieth . The loan to the British Government was purely an emergency loan , and it is understood that it will be replaced with a bond-issue loan just as soon as the Treasury can complete its arrangements for issuing bonds . The transfer of the big sum was made in Secretary AlcAdoo 's office at Washington in the presence of Federal Reserve Board and Treasury and British Embassy officials . Lord Cunliffe immediately afterward took the Treasury warrant to the British Embassy , where it . was delivered to Sir Cecil Spring-Rice , Ambassador from Great Britain . Sir Cecil , acting on behalf of the British Government. , gave the Treasury a note for the money bearing the same rate of interest as that borne by the issue of United States Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness . The warrant received , Sir Cecil indorsed it over to the United States Treasury with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System to the credit of his government . " What this meant to Great Britain was described by the notable pen of Ambassador Page in a letter to President . Wilson , dated London , May four ' li : " 1 beard all the speeches in both houses on the resolution of appreciation of our coming into the IV r . It was n't oratory but . it was well said and well meant . They know how badly they need help and they do mean to be as good to us as their benignant insularity will permit . They are changing . I ca n't describe the great difference that . the war has made to them . They 'll almost become docile in a little more time . And we came in the nick of time for them  --  very true .

They saw blue ruin without our financial help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required , Congress voted $7,000,000,000 more from the proceeds of Liberty Bonds to be loaned to foreign governments on their unsecured promissory notes , which were received temporarily in lieu of bonds ; always these notes were to be replaced later by bonds running parallel to the Liberty Bonds on which the American Government borrowed the money . The total amount authorized was $10,000,000,000 . All subsequent acts , however , were merely extensional . It was understood that our undertaking to provide credit was unlimited and the character of the transactions had been definitely established . American Treasury loans to foreign governments , beginning in April , 1917 , ended in November , 1920 , and amounted , net , to somewhat less than $11,000,000,000 . They fall under three main headings , namely , ( a ) pre-Armistice loans , ( b ) post-Armistice loans , and ( c ) loans after the war for relief , for reconstruction , for mopping up , and to enable European governments to buy a great quantity of surplus American property in Europe . This last-named item in France alone was $400,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foreign governments , pre-Armistice , were a little more than $7,000,000,000 . Direct cash advances from the United States Treasury to foreign governments , post-Armistice , were a little more than 52,300,000,000 . The simplest one statement of the post-Armistice account . was contained in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for the year 1920 , p. 81 , as follows : " Since the Armistice we have extended to foreign governments the following financial assistance : The Beginning of the Controversy ( ' LASTING out the item of accrued interest from V. ) this post-Armistice account and adding the direct Treasury advances made before the Armistice , you arrive at the total principal of American Treasury loans of all kinds . It was just under 811,000,000,000 . Nearly four-fifths of this total principal amount was borrowed by four countries  --  namely , Great Britain , France , Italy and Belgium , ranking in the order named . And 111 this represented money raised by the American Government both from the sale of Liberty Bonds and by taxation , and reloaned to foreign governments . By far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonds , and those Liberty Bonds are still outstanding in the hands of the American people . Congress never imagined redeeming them out of American taxes . It was taken for granted that the foreign governments were going to redeem the obligations they delivered to the United States // Treasury as they got the money , and as they redeemed their obligations the United States Treasury automatically would redeem the parallel Liberty Bonds . " The indebtedness incurred by the United States to make the foreign loans is not cared for by the sinking fund . Congress contemplated that foreign repayments would provide for that part of our debt . " ? Report of the Secretary of the Treasury , 1920 , p. 64 . As to the character of these American Treasury loans to foreign governments , a controversy that was invented in Europe immediately after the war has continued ever since , with increasing ill will , confusion of fact . and emotional bitterness . Were they by nature formal transactions between nations , subject to the terms and sequels of financial usage , or had they a meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repayment repugnant ?

" In bringing this bill before Congress , the Ways and Means Committee of the House unanimously stated : " It authorizes the purchase with the proceeds from the sale of these Liberty bonds of the obligations of foreign governments bearing the same rate of interest and containing essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of this act .

It will , therefore , be observed that the $31100,000,000 credit proposed to bc extended o foreign governments % ill take care of itself and will not constitute an indebtedness that will have to he met. by taxation in the future . " In the course of debate several objections were raised . One was that we were proposing to buy the obligations of foreign governments at par , whereas their bonds were already selling at a discount . To this the chairman of the Ways and Means Commit tee replied : " If their bonds have gone down 141 SO or 75 or 50 per cent , all the more necessity exists for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BIG PARADE The answer , if it exists , would be found ( a ) in the law itself , ( b ) in the contract , ( c ) in the attitude of the borrowers at the time , if there is any record of that , and ( d ) in the use the borrowers made of the money  --  that is to say , in facts tending to show whether their use of it was as that of borrowers who meant to pay it back with interest and had , therefore , full and unlimited rights in it , or otherwise . Loan Made in Good Faith HE law was explicit . Section 2 of the First Lib- erty yLoan Act reads as follows : " That for the purpose of more effectually providing for the national security and defense and prosecuting the war by establishing credits in the United States for foreign governments , the Secretary of the Treasury , with the f approval of the President , is hereby authorized , on behalf of the United States , to purchase , at par , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of the United States , their obligations hereafter issued . bearing the same rate of interest There were ninny emotional passages . That would be expected . Those who showed too much anxiety about the safety of t he loans were rebuked by others who said security was not what Ive ought to be thinking of . Some kept saying the burrowers were fighting- our battles . This provoked a gentleman from Pennsylvania to say : " I do not like the suggestion that the reason we propose to lend them the proceeds of our bends is to reward them for ' fighting our bat Iles . ' My view is that these foreign governments are fighting their own battles rend that we are aiding them . When we lend these foreign couni ries money Ive are rendering I hem an assistance and they are not rendering assistance to us . " A gentleman from Virginia said he wished it were possible to write into the bill a ' ' forbearance and remittance upon any French bonds purchased by the American Government. , " and this sentiment was applauded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The facts are that . Congress entertained no proposal to treat t he loans as gifts or subsidies , nor otherwise at all ilian as loans , strictly repayable with interest , and that the bill as quoted became a law by unanimous vote in both I louse and Senate . . fis Nominated in the Bond All the contracts were formal . There was , however , some deviation from the law . It provided that we were to buy I he bonds of foreign governments , their bonds to be parallel in terms and interest to the Liberty Bonds sold by the American Government to raise the money ; but there was never time to prepare the foreign bonds , and for that reason our Treasury accepted from foreign governments , in lieu of bonds , their promissory notes .

This certificate will be converted by the government of name of foreign country if requested by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America , at par , with an adjustment of accrued interest , into an equal amount of rate per cent convertible gold bonds of the government of name of foreign country ' conforming to the provisions of acts of Congress of the United States . Signed by its representative . For the government of name of foreign country . Dated the day of When the direct cash advances ceased , in November , 1920 , the American Treasury held such notes to the face value of nearly 510,000,000,000 . They were separately signed by eleven foreign governments . The principals were : As to the attitude of the borrowers , it is to be said first that never during the war was there any suggestion coming from them that the terms were hard or ungenerous , or that . the loans were not . loans in a strict financial sense , repayable in full with interest . France explicitly rejected the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a gift or subsidy . France Refuses a Gift On April 11 , 1917 , while the first Liberty Loan Act was pending in Congress , and the gentleman from Virginia saying he wished it were possible to write into the law some " forbearance and remittance " in the case of France , the American Ambassador to France wired from Paris to the Secretary of State in Washington as follows : " The Premier personally expressed the hope to me that no resolution would he introduced or debated in Congress tending to make a gift to the government of France from the United States , however much the sentiment of good will prompting it might be appreciated by the French people . " There is more to the same point in this part of the record . Le Main , of Paris , published portions of a cable exchange between the French Premier and the French Ambassador to the United States , as follows : April 12,1917 . DIPLOMATIE , PARIS . I have just had an interview with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding our financial needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no observation from him ; the amount of $218,000,000 , which would be reached by adding our expenses outside the United States , appeared high to him , but it is not impossible that we shall get it . As one of our Allies has made some remarks on the necessity of equal treatment for all , under the pretext that the contrary would be humiliating , special favors for France are no longer spoken of , although it is possible that more will be hoard of this later . The rate of interest will be the same that the Government of the United States will be able to obtain , ( Continued from Page 106 ) probably 31,6 per cent , with the guaranty that if subsequent loans are made at a higher rate , the same interest will be paid to the holders of the first loan . This interest by the terms of the law shall be paid by all the Allied countries concerned . As to the term for repayment , I mentioned  --  supposing this to be desirable  --  that of 15 years . Mr. 11IcAdoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , JUSSERAND . April 17,1917 .

I believed that I had good reason . to suppose that 15 years would be considered satisfactory . Signed , JUSSERAND . PARIS , April 19,1917 . FRENCH AMBASSADOR , WASHIlsK4TON . The Minister of Finance insists that the term of amortization shall be 30 years , a normal and minimum term in such operations . Signed , RieoT . Where the Money Went In the settlements that have been so much disputed about , France did receive special treatment . The amount to be repaid was reduced practically to post-Armistice loans , and the term of repayment was made not thirty years , which the French themselves had suggested as the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its place . Immediately upon the intervention of the United States as a belligerent , England and France sent missions to this country to discuss cooperation . Head of the British mission was Arthur J. Balfour , Foreign Minister and former Premier of Great Britain . His part was diplomacy . With him came Lord Cunliffe , Governor of the Bank of England ; his part was finance . Head of the French mission was M. Viviani , Minister of Justice ; his associate and financial adviser was 111 . Simon , Inspector of Finance . The first business of these missions was finance . As part of its campaign to sell Liberty Bonds , the United States Treasmy , in 1917 , issued a long popular statement telling why we were lending the proceeds of Liberty Bonds to foreign governments and the meaning of such loans . The money was not a contribution to the Allies , our associates ; it was loaned to them and would ultimately be repaid in full . That view was very positive . Also the view that the Allies were perfectly solvent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready money . And if it should seem that one effect of these loans was to uphold their own trade and commerce , so much the better . It was sound economic policy on our part to assist them to do this . That made them all the stronger as belligerents and debtors . In these views and representations the foreign missions heartily collaborated . They were undoubtedly sincere ; everybody was . It is the record . " The foreign governments were therefore required by the Treasury to state the purposes to be served in order to enable the Treasury to determine whether they were germane to the purposes indicated by the Liberty Loan Acts and whether and in what , amounts credits should be given . The Treasury did not , of course , make expenditures for the foreign governments . It paid to them the purchase price of the securities , and they made the expenditures . " ? Report of the Secretary of the Treasury , 1920 , p. 69 . But in the view of the American Treasury at the time almost anything tending to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upholding their private industry and commerce , was considered germane . And this leads to the matter of how the money actually was spent  --  as if the borrowers had full rights in it because they meant to pay it back with interest , or otherwise ? On Page 340 of the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury , 1920 , Exhibit 27 , appears the following summary of what they did with the money : They did use American Treasury dollars to pay of loans in Wall Street  --  loans contracted there with private bankers before this country entered the war . That . is the explanation of item , " Maturities , $648,246,317 , " in the summary above . New Debts for Debt Payments Item , " Interest , $730,504,177 , " represents , among other things , the payment of interest on their promissory notes at the United States Treasury with the proceeds of new notes  --  that is , they borrowed money to pay interest on what they had borrowed before and continued in a punctilious manner to pay interest in. that . way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped lending they stopped paying interest .. Paying interest on borrowed money out of that money itself is , under certain temporary circumstances , a practice understood by finance ; the importance of noting it . at , all is further to indicate the attitude of the borrowers at the time . The transactions were financial in a strict sense , so understood by everyone . Item , " Reimbursements , S1,872 , - 914,604 , " represents money borrowed at the United States Treasury by one foreign government to pay back another foreign government . The silver was for India . The other items are generally self-explanatory , with one exception  --  the largest : " Exchange and cotton purchases , 32,644,783,870 . " Commenting on this item , the Secretary of the Treasury , annual report , 1920 , p. 71 , said : In the early stages of the war all commodity purchases by Great Britain were thus merged in exchange , except purchases of munitions and sugar . Therefore , the exchange item in the British statement // of expenditures reflected purchases of wheat , food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Nv 11 as all transactions of individual buyers in the United States . " Any Treasury statement touching this exchange item , or any banker 's statement about it , is bound to be technical , not that the people of finance love to be technical , only that they understand one another better in a language of their own . But what it means is , after all , quite simple ; and it is what Mr. Balfour was thinking of when he said to Ambassador Page that the imperative need was for enough American credit to support the exchange  --  that is to say , the buying power of the pound sterling . Great Britain , remember , had been hanker for the Allies since the beginning of the war . Tier value to them in that . role , beyond the fact that she possessed enormous financial resources , was that the pound sterling was the paramount money of the world and that British bankers , from long experience , were the most skillful practitioners of the art of foreign exchange . Well , what they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war " referred to by the Secretary or the Treasury , meaning early in the period of American participation , was this : Instead of spending the dollars they borrowed out of the American Treasury in a direct manner for American commodities , they spent those dollars to huy the pound sterling  --  or , as hankers would say , sterling exchange , which comes to the same thing  --  in the New York exchange market . In one hand they used American Treasury dollars to create British credit with which , in the other hand , they transacted the business of buying American commodities . But why ? Why should they use American dollars to buy sterling . exchange , thereby creating British credit to spend , instead of spending American dollars direct for American commodities Because in that way they could continue to control the international exchange of the world in terms of the pound sterling and uphold the power of British credit .. The advantages were very important . When Dollars Supported Pounds For the remainder of the war the exchange Nralue of the pound sterling  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other country was at least one-quarter more than its true value . II aving an unlimited amount of American Treasury dollars to support it with , they were able to peg , or stabilize , it at an artificial value . Thus , wherever in the world the British had to spend pounds , they got just that much more for their money . And when the American Government had to buy pounds in London to meet its own war expenses in Great Britain or to pay the British for transporting American troops to France in British ships , it had to pay just that much more for pounds and got just that much less for its money . Finally , by thus merging their transactions under the head of exchange , so that they had only to report to the United States Treasury that so and so many dollars had been expended for exchange , they gained obviously much more freedom of action . " It will readily be apparent that completely to analyze the total purchases of exchange is impossible . " ? From the report of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the heading , " Expenditures Reported by Foreign Governments . " All the Treasury knew , as the Secretary of the Treasury had said before , was that the exchange item in the British expenditures reflected purchases of wheat , food , cotton , leather and oil under British Government control , as well as all transactions of individual buyers . Which means that British credit . created in the New York foreign-exchange market with dollars from the American Treasury was used not only to buy American commodities for the British Government ; to an unknown extent it was used also to buy American commodities for British individuals ; in other words , for private account as distinct from public account , a distinction modified only by the view that in such a war as that was all activities , direct and indirect , were vital , even those of private trade . That. , indeed , was the view of the United States Treasury , indicated in its popular bulletin on why we were lending the proceeds of Liberty Bonds to foreign governments . In that view it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the money as how much we could afford to lend . England 's Use of War Loans " Millions of dollars of Liberty Loan money were lent to Great Britain after hostilities had ceased , to enable her to build up her export trade . There is no question in regard to these facts , and also in regard to the fact . that considerable loans were made to the newer countries to help them get on their feet . " ? From The Inter-Ally Debts , by Harvey E. Fisk , published by the Bankers Trust Company , of New York . That was quite all right at the time . Whatever the borrowing foreign governments did with their American Treasury dollars wa-s all right , and no question was ever raised about . it. , so long as they continued to treat the loans in the character in which they were originally understood , meaning loans as such , repayable . But when , after the war , they began to say the only resemblance the loans bore to financial transactions was their legal form , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British , for an all-round cancellation of war debts , then the British became extremely resentful of any saying that they had used American Treasury dollars for other than purely war purposes . On . July 14 , 1926 , Mr. Mellon , as Secretary of the Treasury , wrote a public letter to an American cancellationist to explain , among other things , why in the terms of settlement Great Britain was treated with less leniency than France . In that letter be said : " It must be remembered that England borrowed a large proportion of its debt to us for purely commercial as distinguished from war purposes  --  to meet its commercial obligations maturing in the United States , to furnish India with silver , to buy food to be resold to its civilian population , and to maintain exchange . " This drew a hot retort from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , who , on July 19 , 1926 , rose in Parliament to say : " During the period of American intervention over seven billions of dollars was spent by Great Britain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four and provided , in addition , three billions from our own independent resources . . . . Regarding commercial maturities , Secretary Mellon must either have been misinterpreted or misled . We spent on commercial maturities during the same period only $345,000,000 , or rather less than one-twentieth of the total dollar expenditures for which we were re . sponsible . . . . There has been a great deal of resentment and ill feeling regarding this debt , and it is very important that this resentment shall not be increased by a misunderstanding of the actual facts . " The next day  --  July twentieth  --  the United States Treasury issued the following statement in rejoinder : " From England 's total reported expenditures in America , from April 6 , 1917 , to November 1 , 1920 , there should be deducted the 51,853,000,000 expenditures for which Great Britain was simply the purchasing agent for the other Allies and for which Great Britain was paid by the other Allies from money loaned to them by the United States . This amount was not provided from England 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount $1,682,000,000 represents ' exchange and cotton purchases . ' The greater part of this expenditure was for the maintenance of sterling exchange , not necessary for purchases in America , but which enabled England to make purchases in other countries at an undepreciated exchange rate . Then $2,643,000,000 was for food and tobacco . A part of this item is probably included in the account out of which England wa-s reimbursed by the other Allies and a part was resold by England to its own civilian population . To the extent of this resale England avoided the necessity of floating loans in its own country . Then $507,877,000 was for interest and principal of England 's commercial obligations maturing in America , and $261,000,000 was for silver . The total principal advances to Great Britain after the Armistice were $581,000,000 . " The British Chancellor of the Exchequer subsided ; the next retort . came from the British Treasury , not on the facts but on the interpretation of events . It said : " Great Britain provided sterling and neutral currencies to meet all her own requirements throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering the sterling requirements of her Continental Allies . But for the fact that the United States did not feel able , on entering the war , to relieve her of that additional burden , Great Britain would have been able to meet from the resources she placed at the disposal of her Allies her own expenditures in America , and in all human probability the British debt to the g , United States would never have been incurred . " Post.Armistice Debt Adjustment What the British Treasury is saying is this : That if only the American Treasury had loaned France , Italy , Belgium , and others , the money they needed to spend in Great Britain , they would not have had to borrow anything more from Great Britain after we got into the war . They would have had American dollars to spend in the British Empire , and that would have made it very much easier for Great Britain , of course . It would have been very much easier for her still if the American Treasury had loaned France , Italy , Belgium , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Great Britain before we entered the war . " The question of a general joint adjustment of all debts arising out of the war did not arise until after the Armistice . It first appears to have been informally suggested by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Crosby , who was then in Europe , repudiated by him and apparently dropped for the time being . " ? Annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury , 1926 , p. 63 . The phrase , " and apparently dropped for the time being , " is an example of Treasury accuracy outside of arithmetic . For the debtor governments the situation at that time was extremely delicate . They were politically united against the United States as the great common creditor ; the ideal way to ' make America pay according to her capacity was to involve her at once in a scheme of general war-debt cancellation , wherein as the only ultimate creditor she would be the only ultimate loser ; and it was important to advance immediately upon this object while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the peace treaty . But , on the other hand , they were still borrowing American Treasury dollars on post-Armistice account . If they moved too fast the American Treasury might become suddenly realistic and close the book . On January 15 , 1919 , the French High Commissioner in the United States addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury , saying : " The financial relations among the Allies , brought about by the war , are closely interwoven . The British and French governments have both borrowed from the United States ; but France is also a. debtor of England . The French and Italian governments have both borrowed from the United States ; but Italy is also a debtor of France . Although a debtor of the United States and of Great Britain , France has loaned about 10.000,000,000 francs to its Allies . It appears to my government that , if the future adjustment of such mutual accounts is to be made the object of separate and distinct . agreements , privileged situations might arise to the prejudice of some of the governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debit and credit were considered at the same time , and as a. whole , it would be easier , according to equity , to settle the respective situation of these governments . On the other hand , it appears that the possibility of reimbursement by certain governments may be deeply affected by the conditions of the Treaty of Peace , especially by the indemnities to be received eventually from Germany , and , in the case of some countries , as Serbia , for instance , by the distribution of territory and the establishment of new boundary lines . In short. , the French Government . looks upon these questions as concerning all the Allies and demanding a general and simultaneous settlement . " Equal Rights for - fill I do not anticipate that the treasuries of the respective countries will have any difficulty in arriving at arrangements which will be equitable and free from discrimination .

Only a few days later , the French High Commissioner , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied that any French official had suggested to President Wilson the idea that the United States should share the Allies ' war expenditures as if it had been in the war from the beginning . But then the American Treasury heard that at a meeting of the financial drafting committee appointed by the Council of Ten at the peace conference . in Paris , the French member , M. Klotz , had supported the proposal that a consolidation and reapportionment of war debts be one of the peace-table questions ; and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury asked the Deputy French High Commissioner in Washington if that could be true , saying : " You will appreciate that the Treasury can not contemplate continuance of advances to any Allied government which is lending its support to any plan which would create uncertainty as to its due repayment of advances made to it by the United States Treasury .

" Furthermore , " he said , " with reference to the attitude of the French officials toward the principle involved in this question , the French Government never made any declaration favoring either the Italian proposition or any other similar proposition . " This exchange between the United States Treasury and the Deputy French High Commissioner , in 1919 , will be found reprinted in the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury , year 1926 , p. 66 , together with the following comment. : " It is to be noted that Assistant Secretary Rathbone 's letter of l'Vlarch 8 , 1.919 , to Mr. de Billy , Deputy French High Commissioner , stated that the Treasury could not contemplate continuance of advances to any Allied government lending it ; support to a plan which would create uncertainty as to its due repayment of advances made to it by the United States Treasury . Mr. de Billy , in his reply of March 18 , 1919 , removed this uncertainty as to due repayment . The cash advances of the United States to France subsequent to March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , there was an indebtedness of $407,000,000 incurred by France to the United States in the purchase of war stocks , a. total of approximately $1,100,000,000 . " Nothing more was heard from the French for a long time . From there the British went on wi th it . Out of place in the chronology , yet illuminating at this point , are two notable contributions in the American point of view . One is a letter from Norman H. Davis , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , to President Wilson , dated February 23 , 1920 ? reprinted in Senate Document No. 86 , Dec. 6 , 1921 ? ag follows : " I have for some time suspected that the loans made by England-to France and Italy have not the same standing as our loans to the told me England could not afford to force these countries to pay her . Article XI of the Pact of London states : ' Italy shall receive a military contribution corresponding to her strength and sacrifices . ' I do not know what this means . It most probably has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now held by the British Government , and it may well be that . the British desire a general cancellation of intergovernmental war debts as a means of discharging secret-treaty provisions . If such is the case , the British might thus , in a great . part at our expense , discharge their treaty obligations . " Britain 's New Debt Policy Another is from the Hon. Oscar T. Crosby , who , as Assistant . Secretary of the Treasury , had intimate contact with all these mat ters both here and in Europe . It was he to whom the British Chancellor of the Exchequer first suggested a pooling of war debts . Out . of his experiences in Europe Mr. Crosby wrote : " . . . Complex not simple relations exist . between European countries . Money considerations , territorial transfers , commercial privileges  --  all these are in constant flux . Among Allies trading is the order of the day . It begins often long before hostilities , continues during the war , is most active at . the peace table , and may be protracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The money problem between France and Great Britain is only one of many problems arising between them , and it is quite to be expected that France will use every asset , political or material , which may be available in a perfectly legitimate trading process . . . . It is quite possible that while the shuttle is weaving to and fro through these various threads , Great Britain , without waiting for the long. - drawn end , may decide to make a gesture of generosity , proposing to cut . her claims against France if we will but move pan ' passe with her . . . And if we decline this sort of proposition , again we play the rule of the hard-hearted person , and so on , to both the British and the French man in the street . " And this turned out to be an amazingly perfect forecast of the celebrated Balfour note , in which the British debt - policy has ever since been grounded . War-debt cancellation became a forbidden subject at the peace-conference table ; nevertheless , representatives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the peace conference , on February 4 , 1920 , one of them , Mr. Blackett , wrote to the Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury , saying : " . . And as you are aware , the Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed himself ready to take any steps toward relieving the governments which are debtors to the British Government of the burden of their debts which the United States Treasury might feel able to propose in regard to the obligations of the governments which it . holds . " Then , on February 9 , 1920 , the British Embassy in Washington delivered to the American Treasury a message direct from the Chancellor of the Exchequer , in which he said flatly : " We should welcome a general cancellation of intergovernmental war debts . " To this the Secretary of the Treasury , on March 1 , 1920 , replied in parts as follows : " Of course I recognize that a general cancellation of such debts would be of advantage to Great Britain and that it would probably not involve any losses on her part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government which would be canceled under such a plan , the effect would be that , in consideration of a cancellation by the United States Government of obligations which it holds for advances made to the British Government and other Allied governments , the British Government would cancel its debts against France , Italy , Russia and her other Allies . Such a proposal does not involve mutual sacrifices on the part of the nations concerned . It simply involves a contribution mainly by the United States . . . A general cancellation as suggested would . . throw upon the people of this country the exclusive burden of meeting the interest . and of ultimately extinguishing the principal of our loans to the Allied governments . " This nation has neither sought nor received substantial benefits from the war . On the other hand , the Allies , although having suffered greatly in loss of lives and property , have , under the terms of the treaty of peace , and otherwise , acquired very considerable accessions of territories , populations , economic and other advantages . It would therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the whole situation , there would be no desire nor reason to call upon the Goverment of this country for further contributions . " Thus the British Treasury came to an impasse with the American Treasury . Further exchanges were futile . The next step was much higher . On August . 5 , 1920 , the Prime Minister of treat Britain , Mr. Lloyd George , wrote to President Wilson about the debts as follows : " I come now to the other question . ' wish to write to you about , and that is the knotty problem of Interallied indebtedness . . . . The British and French governments have been discussing during the last four months the question of giving fixity and definiteness to Germany 's reparation obligations . The British Government has stood steadily by the view that it was vital that . Germany 's liabilities should be fixed at a figure which it was within the reasonable capacity of Germany to pay . . . . After great difficulties with his own people , M. Millerand found himself able to accept this view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France to accept . anything less than it . was entitled to under the treaty unless its debts to its Allies and associates in the war were treated in the same way . This declaration appeared to the British Government eminently fair . But after careful consideration they came to the conclusion that it . was . impossible to remit any part of what was owed to them by France except as part and parcel of all-round settlement of Interallied indebtedness . . . . Accordingly , the British Government has informed the French Government that it will agree to any equitable arrangement for the reduction or cancellation of Interallied indebtedness , but that such an arrangement must be one that applies all round . . . . I should very much welcome any advice which you might feel yourself able to give me as to the best method of securing that the whole problem could be considered and settled by the United States Government in concert with its associates . " This is perhaps the most significant one document in the whole record . The British Prime Minister is saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the reasonable capacity of Germany to pay , only provided the creditors of France forgive France her debts to them ; and this seems eminently fair to the British Government , pro-sided the American Government will forgive all of them their debts to the United States Treasury . Emotion Replaces Economics President Wilson replied to the Prime Minister of Great Britain as follows , November -3 , 1920 : " It . is highly improbable that either the Congress or popular opinion in this country will ever permit a cancellation of any part of the debt of the British Government to the United States in order to induce the British Government to remit , in whole or in part , the debt . to Great Britain or France or any other of the Allied governments , or that it would consent to a cancellation or reduction in the debts of any of the Allied governments as an inducement towards a practical settlement of the reparation claims . . . . The United States Government ... fails to perceive the logic in a suggestion in effect either that the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shall make a gratuity to the Allied governments to induce them to fix such obligation at an amount within Germany 's capacity to pay . " President Wilson 's letter produced nearly two years of official silence . But in place of all the political and economic arguments that had failed was substituted an emotional propaganda unprecedented in volume , intensity and ramifications , in the press of Europe , in the press of the United States , in subsidized books , in public and parliamentary speeches , on the American lecture platform by visiting Europeans  --  all with the effect , if not with the deliberately organized intent , to raise against this country a tide of injurious feeling . This was the Shylock nation , insisting upon the value of its dollars against the lives Europe had poured out in a common cause . And all this time Europe 's promissory notes lay fading in the vaults of the United States Treasury . The debtor governments ignored them . They had not been funded into long-term bonds , as the contract was ; not a dollar of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1922 , all the anti-American feeling thus prepared in Europe was gathered up and fixed in the famous Balfour note , which for literary style and subtlety of dia lect is one of the fine examples of demagogic statecraft in the political papers of the English language .
