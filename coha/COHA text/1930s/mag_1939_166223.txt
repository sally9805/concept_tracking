Everyone takes it for granted that the sun will go on shining until he dies-and , as a matter of lesser interest , for a long time after he dies . Astrophysicists , who believe the solar star-stuff has been hot for billions of years and will be so for billions of years more , have long cudgeled their brains for a reason why . Most favored of recent theories is that hydrogen is the fuel . It is known that the sun does not " burn " hydrogen , in the sense of releasing stored chemical energy as from coal ; it physically changes fragments of hydrogen atoms directly into radiation . But the question remains : Just what atomic processes enable the hydrogen to be utilized as fuel ? <P> At a meeting of the venerable , rich American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia last week , grey , gentle Astronomer Henry Norris Russell of Princeton ( see p. 58 ) explained what he considers the most reasonable modern theory on this question . The theory was worked out mathematically by Dr. Hans Albrecht Bethe of Cornell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down to figure out what atomic reactions would occur often enough to be important in the sun 's energy economy , yet not so often as to use up the supply of some important ingredient in a hurry . He found that , at temperatures above 15,000,000 C. , hydrogen atoms would attack carbon . The carbon atom would disappear for a while , but after a further series of reactions in which three more hydrogen atoms would be used up , the carbon would reappear , ready to be used again . Thus carbon , though not depleted itself , is the agent that annihilates hydrogen , creates energy . A use less end-product , or " ash , " is helium gas . <P> One complete cycle withdrawing and returning a carbon atom to circulation requires more than 52,000,000 years . But such an enormous number of cycles are going on all the time that they keep the sun stuff hot . <P> An exile from Germany 's University of Munich , demure Dr. Bethe at Cornell has increased his repute as an atomic theorist like a snowball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics journal nowadays in which he has not some new light to shed on old problems , or in which other physicists do not find occasion to cite his work . Dr. Russell in Philadelphia last week left no doubt that this new work on the sun is a highly valued contribution-from an astrophysical point of view , very hot stuff indeed .
