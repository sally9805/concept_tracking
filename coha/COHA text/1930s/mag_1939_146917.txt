Aware of his new found power , he developed a plan whereby he would relieve working men of their jobs for a week or two so that they might have a vacation . <P> " One day he had a revelation from heaven that he was Christ and in an attack of catatonic mad excitement became violent , " ended up in a State hospital as a victim of schizophrenia .
