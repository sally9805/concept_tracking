WHEN certain gentlemen of none too friendly a character came to LouisPhilippe and suggested that his services were no longer required on the throne , he is said to have replied , " I am not inclined to oblige you in this matter , but certainly I will make no move until I have talked with my wife . " LouisPhilippe was a so-called bourgeois king , and his reply was that of the typical French bourgeois . For there is no denying that the women of France have a decided influence over their men . We in America may plume ourselves on our legal rights and the favored-nation treatment which our men accord us , but we need waste no pity on the Frenchwoman because she has not the vote and because the law reduces her when she marries to the status of a minor . Without benefit of the law , she has made the most of being a woman ? and we may well envy the position she has won for herself . There is probably no more misunderstood creature than the Frenchwoman . French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The memoirs of court life during the reigns of the Louis ? when , as Voltaire said , " every married woman at court was privileged to have at least one lover , " picture her as having more wit than character , while novelists of modern times have made her the prey of her emotions . If we were to judge from the Madame Bovarys , Anatole France 's red lilies , de Maupassant'sfilles de joie , Colette 's vagabandesenslaved by love , and Marcel Proust 's ladies of a decadent society , we should have to conclude that nine out of ten Frenchwomen are preoccupied with the gratification of their senses . But anyone who is fortunate enough to see the interior of a French home soon discovers that the Frenchwoman 's interests are anything but frivolous . She is the responsible head of the household , the center round which the family revolves . Beyond a doubt the law treats her very badly . " The wife , " Napoleon said , " must learn that she owes obedience to her husband " ? a lesson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilful Josephine . Since his time the section of the Code Civil affecting the status of the married woman has been slightly modified , but even now a wife may not leave the country without her husband 's permission ; she may not open a bank account without his authorization unless she is herself engaged in business or a profession ; and she may not visit friends or frequent places of which he disapproves . The husband has absolute control over the children and he may dispose as he chooses of his wife 's property unless the marriage contract calls for a complete separation des Wens , or unless it reserves her dot in her name . A wife may consequently be left destitute by a husband who has squandered or made off with her dot . In case of divorce the law requires the husband to return to his wife what there is left of the dot , but when he deserts he is at liberty to place it in the hands of a third party temporarily so that he can not be forced to make restitution . A divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife has deposited in his child 's name , and she will have no redress . Rascally husbands may and do exploit these laws . However , the average French husband never thinks of robbing his wife because the two of them are united in a common endeavor . And he is far too meek to open her letters or dictate to her about her comings and goings . It is true that in the provinces , especially in the hienpensant sections of the country where the Roman Catholic faith has not lost its hold , the theory of male superiority persists , and the wife is often obliged to make a show of acceding to her husband 's authority . Yet there is nothing downtrodden about the provincial Frenchwoman : she resembles rather those solid commanding figures which surround the Place de la Concorde , symbolizing the eight cities of provincial France . Frenchwomen will tell you that the War emancipated them in many respects . They say that before 1914 no respectable woman , either in Paris or the provinces , could afford to be seen in a cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband ; and the suggestion that a woman should drive her own automobile or take part in outdoor sports or enter a profession was no less shocking . The jeans fills , as everyone knows , was rigorously chaperoned until the time of her marriage , all that she read was censored , and she was educated either at home or in a girls ' school . Since the War most of the tabus as to what a woman may or may not do have broken down , and now it is not unusual for the daughters of the upper bourgeoisie and the aristocracy to attend the same secondaryschools and universities as their broth , ers . The increased freedom of Frenchwomen and the broader education they are receiving are undoubtedly develop , ing them ; yet even before they had these advantages they were persons of importance . II The Frenchwoman can afford to shrug her shoulders over the inequalities of the law , for she has enough wit and wisdom to hold her own with any husband . " I will please him and surround him with comforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in her creed . Knowing her husband to be a gourmet , she occasionally goes into the kitchen to supervise the cooking of his favorite dishes or to prepare with her own hands a piece de resistance . If he has had a hard day at the office , she is the first to suggest that they spend the evening at home . If he dislikes to be kept waiting , she will make a point of promptness in all matters . Should he be able to take only a short vacation and should it seem wise for her to spend the summer in the country on the children 's account , she will leave her most trustworthy servant to look after him in the city , and should he be even slightly indisposed , she will rush back to care for him . He is likely to be less aware of her physical needs than she is of his , and he does not fetch and carry for her as does an American husband . But the French wife has her reward , for her many little attentions convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important person in his own home . The French wife does everything she can , not only to please her husband , but to make herself indispensable to him . If she holds the purse strings it is because she can stretch the family income farther than he can . The French husband is far more likely than the American to let his wife censor all of his expenditures ? from the money which he drops into the collection plate to the price which he pays for an automobile or the kind of bonds which he buys as an investment . In domestic matters she is a wonderful manager . " On s'arrange " ( " I shall get along some way " ) is one of her favorite expressions . Two old dresses are made over into a new frock and the money is found for the son to play tennis . A small dinner-party has to be given , and she manages without engaging extra help or running up the grocery bill . Yet when the guests arrive , her own toilet has been perfectly made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . I have heard it said of the Frenchwoman that she can adapt herself to any kind of a situation . Certainly her resourcefulness since the War has been put to the severest test . With the price of living four times as high and investments seriously reduced in value , French parents have been faced with the problem of educating their children and maintaining a decent standard of living .. Servants have had to be dismissed , and frequently a few paying guests , as a rule students from other countries , have been taken . This has meant hard work for the mistress of the establishment and a sacrifice of privacy . And yet the most gently bred women ? who may have already contributed good-sized dots to their marriage do not complain . " I should much rather make this adjustment than be worried every month about the bills , " a Countess friend of mine remarked without assuming the air of a martyr . " Hats off , " writes a French journalist ? a man ? " to those women who raise a family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a blockhead of a husband . " All French husbands are not blockheads , but it is invariably the women whohave the sound practical sense and who are responsible for the savings that are laid aside . No matter how comfortable the family 's income , the wife still watches the sous . One day at tea I met a smartly gowned Frenchwoman who , as I afterwards learned , is the wife of a very well-todo man . She was complaining about the high cost of living and wanted to know how the prices of meat and other food in Paris compared with those in New York . Anyone who has traveled in France knows how capable the women of the trades class are . It is the paironne in your hotel who quotes you special rates and keeps you satisfied , and in your favorite restaurant it is the sharpeyed woman on the throne behind the cash register who watches every move that the waiters make . The women of this class bring up their children and manage the family business at the same time ? all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active in their husband 's businesses and yet they are generally privy to all that they are doing . I think of a highly educated beautiful young Frenchwoman , who might be suspected of having only literary and worldly interests , yet she frequently spends Sunday with her husband in his office going over his books . And whenever he makes a change in his business or is uncertain of men and their motives he asks her advice . I have noticed that she always makes her suggestions tactfully , without seeming to encroach upon his masculine prerogatives . " Of course , Francois , I may be quite wrong , " she will conclude , looking very feminine . An American man would never delegate his wife to transact an important piece of business for him if there were a lawyer within reach . Yet a French friend tells me that when her father , who was an engineer , was absent in Morocco and became involved in a dispute with the contracting company , he cabled her mother to go to Paris to settle the matter for him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of wives who had no practical business experience ran their husbands ' factories or other affairs without a hitch . When a Parisian woman who was managing her husband 's tin can factory heard that his outfit at the front could not communicate with headquarters for lack of telegraph wire , she stopped the manufacture of tin cans , obtained the necessary machinery , and made telegraph wire in her factory . One occasionally hears the remark in French circles , " Of course he could not succeed , with a gaffe ( a stupid creature ) for a wife . " This would never be given as the reason for an American man 's failure . But it applies in France , because there a man 's success depends as much upon his " connections " as upon his ability , the world of affairs being considerably less democratic than it is in this country . And since the Frenchman has as a rule no college club or fraternal organization to hack him , he relies upon his wife to act as his minister of foreign affairs or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her to cultivate the wives of his business superiors and associates ; because if she does not both they and their husbands will take offense , and when the first of the year comes her husband will not be promoted . It is up to the wife , too , to see that her husband meets the people whom he needs to meet . If a man who is a silk manufacturer would like to be on a friendly footing with Monsieur S. , a large retail merchant , his wife will either make a point of being presented to Mme. S. , and of ingratiating herself , or she will beg a mutual friend to arrange a meeting at her dinner table . During the evening the conversation may range over books , paintings , politics , and history , and not a word will be said aboutbusiness ; but the groundwork will have been laid for friendly relations in the future . That the Frenchman should be guilty of bringing business into the drawingroom may surprise Americans who had believed Babbitt to be the Philistine par excellence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife are more artistic and less patent in their methods , while their culture saves them from being earthbound . In France a husband and wife are thought of as one social personality . If the wife has a balance on the credit side of her social ledger , the husband 's business ledger will very likely also show a good credit . Patients or clients may be attracted to a physician 's office ? which is invariably in his home ? by a wife who knows how to be charming and who is constantly enlarging her receiving and calling list . The wife of a politician gets votes for him in the same way , and it is a rare thing for a bachelor to be elected to a local office . As a general rule the men who succeed most brilliantly in the business , professional , or political world are those whose wives have a capacity for being good hostesses . To-day there are no such famous salons as in past centuries ; yet there are hostesses who know bow to gain their ends through entertaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the " grouping of guests . " A Parisian woman who is the wife of a large publisher and editor is famous for her dinners where writers , artists , professional men , and politicians invariably find themselves next to the person whom they wanted to meet at that particular moment . This hostess knows her official , literary , and artistic Paris very well ; and her husband , being in the business of publishing , benefits from the gratitude of his guests who are often people of importance . HI Capable as the French wife is , her sway over her husband would be incomplete were she not the superior tactician of the two . The Code Napoleon may ordain that " The wife shall follow her husband wherever he goes , " but the Frenchwoman 's own creed says , " I shall lead myhusband in the way he should go , for he can not withstand the strength of my will and he is blind to my wiles . " American women have the reputation of being wilful and yet they lack the tenacity of purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some vital issue she will return to the attack again and again until he gives in from sheer weariness . The religious education of the children may be a case in point . In families where the mother is a conscientious Roman Catholic and the father is a skeptic , the children are almost always brought up in the Church . The famous Socialist Jaures was an atheist of the most radical variety and he and his wife had many arguments about the religious upbringing of their children . Yet in the end she overruled him , for Jaures was a pacifist as well as an atheist and he doubtless wanted tranquillity in his own home . Like Jaures , most Frenchmen will sacrifice their personal views in order to keep the peace with their wives , for despite their prowess as soldiers they dislike conflict and violent expression in the course of everyday life . As a general thing , however , the French wife is clever enough to gain her point by some other strategy than that of attrition. flattery is one of her favorite methods . In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to a religious school , his wife disarmed him with the following argument , " Should I find you so superior to other men , " she put it to him , " should 1 admire in you thatforce of character , that respect for spiritual values which distinguishes you , if these qualities had not been bred in you from your earliest years by the teachings of the Church ? . . . My dearest wish , " she wound up feelingly , " is that our sons shall grow up to make their wives as happy as you have made me . " Monsieur Chose was not without an appreciation of his own good qualities , and so his children went to the parochial school . Very seldom , in any kind of an argument , does a French wife lay her own cards on the table . If her husband inclines towards an apartment that is located in a quartier far removed from her friends , she is quick to see that it contains no smoking den for him or that it is too far from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing other people which is said to make the perfect diplomat . You may know very well that their tactful remarks are not absolutely sincere , and yet what they say is so apropos and so finely shaded that your amour-propre prompts you to believe every word . So it is to be expected that a husband who gets a mild solution of the opiate every day , should be continually pleased with himself and his world and , therefore , easier to manage . A Frenchman of my acquaintance , who has a certain erudition and a fine mellifluous voice , is given to reciting passages from the classics . He is particularly fond of enacting a scene from the Iliad in which he impersonates Paris strutting on the walls of Troy . I suppose that his wife , who is a person of cultivation and taste , has heard him deliver these lines thousands of times during the course of their married life . Yet if she is bored she permits herself to show no sign : every time he brings out his repertory she looks up at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ! " Having inherited Ninon de Lenclos 's knowledge of men and their vanity , Frenchwomen humor them in their weaknesses and do not try to make them over as American women so often do . They are also wise enough to let their husbands enjoy the semblance of authority . One night at dinner I saw a pretty little comedy which was peculiarly French in its flavor . My host was a man whose sole claim to distinction is his name , and my hostess a brilliant woman who , as all their friends know , leads him about au bout du nes . That evening he was boisterously advising a young man who was about to be married how to be " master in his own home . " Having finished his harangue he turned to his wife and said , " A woman likes to be ruled , n'est re pas , ma Were ? " " Mail aui , Philippe , " she smilingly replied , without a shade of irritation in her voice . Absolute frankness to a husband would seem to many Frenchwomen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course they lie to their husbands , because there are things which are not good for them to know . A wife buys a chic dress , fibs to her husband about the price , and saves the difference on another purchase . There is a kind of feminine conspiracy , it seems , against letting men know the price of clothes and toilet articles . Little girls are taught by their mothers to conceal such facts from their fathers , and women friends will exclaim admiringly over one another 's supposed bargains if there is a husband present . A wife may deceive her husband about the price she pays for a piece of furniture ? so that he will admire her cleverness ; about the people she has seen ? so as to avoid his disapproval ; about an indulgence she has allowed one of the children ? so as to avoid discussion . There is a certain type of Frenchwoman , best described as maline , meaning sly or clever , who loves a bit of intrigue for its own sake . When an American friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered by the number of innocent lies which her hostess told her mild-tempered husband . Frenchwomen generally do not carry the principle so far , and yet most of them see no sin in prevarications that keep the surface of married life smooth , provided that they do not harm their husbands . Even the religious type has a practical rather than an ethical sense of moral values . The Frenchman , for his part , may have no sterner a conscience , but he is not usually so clever at deception . " I can always tell from the tone of my husband 's voice over the telephone , " one wife merrily boasted , " if the seminar which he says he has to give in the evening is going to be a very small seminar . " If French husbands are as regularly addicted to " small seminars " as the virtuous Anglo Saxon likes to believe , it may be argued that their wives have a very poor kind of empire over them . Unfortunately there are no statistics on the extent of conjugal infidelity in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facilities for leading an unconventional life are not what they are in Paris . Also , in these difficult years the middle-class Frenchman , in Paris and everywhere else , works long hours at his office ; and if he is absent from home in the evening he must be proof against a fusillade of questions . It is more often in the upper levels of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy that men find the time and the money for extramarital affairs . The wives of these men suffer , for there are fewer complaisant marriages in France than we have been led to believe . The average Frenchwoman , in fact , is very jealous , and now that the stigma has been removed from divorce , she is likely to break up her marriage if her husband carries on a flagrant or prolonged affair with another woman . Perhaps more French wives than American have to put up with a husband 's occasional infidelity . Yet the French wife always holds two trump cards : her husband is as dependent upon her as a child ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him -- and may be the only religion he has . One hears tragic stories of wives who have been put aside , but no more than in this country . The fact that there are in France only one third as many divorces for all causes proportionately as there are in the United States would suggest that the number of French husbands who put a higher value on their pleasures than on their foyers is not shockingly large . As a mother the Frenchwoman plays no less preeminent a role than as a wife . Extremely conscientious , and jealous of her stewardship , she often does not relax her hold upon her children until long after they have come of age . In all probability she has never heard of behaviorism or of Freud 's mother complex , and if she were to be told of these theories she would set their authors down as deranged . American mothers can hardly be accused of neglecting their children , and yet their zeal does not compare with that of French mothers . A cuisiniere who works twelve hours a day , teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school , and will not send them to a summer camp because she can not bear to be separated from them for a night . A young woman lawyer finds time to embroider and knit her baby 's clothes . A woman who entertains a great deal brought up seven children ? four of her own and three of her sister 's ; yet she neverfailed to attend personally to each child 's toilet in the morning , to call for them at school in the afternoon , and to go over their exercises with them at home . French parents have what seems to an American an exaggerated conception of their duty to their children . Not content with educating them and giving them a fair start in life , they will endure hardships ? at least the mother will ? in order to pass on a certain amount of property to them . The same Countess friend who has felt obliged to open her home to a few paying guests , and who deprives herself of such luxuries as the theater and expensive clothes , has a twenty-seven-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents despite the fact that he is working . To add sacrifice to sacrifice she and her husband are investing in a second country home so that each of their two sons will inherit a small manor in addition to valuable furnitdre and objets d'art . The future of their children is a matter of great anxiety to French mothers . They are not so busy as they were before the War finding husbands for their daughters , since boys and girls are mingling more and more in the universities and choosing their own mates . But they are terribly preoccupied with their sons ' careers . Since there is a sharp line of social distinction in France between the professions and commerce or business , every mother of the upper bourgeoisie dreams of seeing her son graduate from the lye &; ( the French preparatory school ) , pass his baccalaureate examination , gain admission to one of the state schools , which may entail one or two more years of preparation , and finally , after three or more years ' advanced study , earn a degree which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a position in the Army or the Navy , or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Colonies . Since educational standards are much higher in France than in this country , the average boy requires a great deal of encouragement and pushing from his mother , who may be more ambitious for him than he is for himself . " My poor mother , " wrote the son of Madame Arman de Caillavet ? the woman who was to exercise so great an influence over Anatole France ? " never left me . It is impossible to describe the trouble she took with me during my first year at the lycie ; she entered into everything I was doing , interested herself in everything , and followed me as closely as was humanly possible . " Madame Caillavet was no exception . Most French mothers " enter into everything their sons are doing " because they have not the American mother 's feeling that they do not belong in a boy 's world . It inevitably follows that a very close bond ? what we should call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " attaches the son to the mother . The dependence begins when the son is a baby , for French mothers so delight in their children 's need of them that they frequently do not apply the first principles of discipline , to say nothing of the new psychology . A Frenchwoman , who conducts an excellent preparatory school for girls and should be well informed in the field of modern education , boasts that her two-year-old son wants to be with her every minute she is in the house . " And when I leave in the morning , " she says complacently , " he weeps for at least half an hour . " Another mother is proud that her son , who is studying law , crosses Paris every day to lunch with her . A third was so desolated when her boy was called for military service that her husband petitioned the Minister of War to station the boy near Paris . French mothers are like clucking hens . Long after their sons have reached their physical majority they continue to shelter them under their wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the third floor of a private French home was more than a little surprised to receive a visit from the mistress of the establishment , who is very much a woman of the world . She was full of apologies but she must beg him not to use his piano after ten-thirty in the evening ( it was the only time in the course of the year that it had happened ) because her eighteen-year-old son , who is studying for his law examinations , finds it difficult to get his rest at night if there is the slightest noise in the house . One wonders if this young man will ever be successful in fighting his own battles as a lawyer . And one begins to understand why Frenchmen generally lack initiative as compared with American men , or even with their own womenfolk . In a mixed group of excursionists , for instance , it is generally the women who hail the fishingboat before other holidaymakers can get it or who succeed in finding the key to the old church the crowd has come to see . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these problems . The French boy 's mother complex does not as a rule prevent his marrying , since the cult of carrying on the family name is very strong in France . But it is likely to lead to a bitter duel between his wife and mother for complete possession of him . When a Frenchman whom I know married at the mature age of thirty he left his clothes at home , following his mother 's suggestion , and returned frequently to make a change . His wife was only twentyone but she was wise enough to sense the implications of the situation and , after waiting for ten months , she informed her husband that he would have to choose between living with her or with his mother . Being very much in love with his wife , he made his choice , but his mother is not yet reconciled to her loss . While the French wife has a great deal to endure from her mother-in-law , still she should thank her for having developed in her son a sensibility which makes him very acceptable as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can distinguish immediately between a man who has grown up in an atmosphere of feminine affection ? in a " chaud intirieur " ? and one who has been brought up quite impersonally , as so many Englishmen are , in a boys ' school . In the first place the French boy learns to be demonstrative without being ashamed , since in every French home where manners are cultivated children of all ages embrace their parents morning and evening . Also , a young man who has been much with his mother comes to understand women 's moods and to anticipate their wishes . He discovers that an unexpected sign of tenderness delights the feminine heart , and he learns how to say a great deal to a woman by the fashion in which he kisses her hand . He acquires too the habit of talking freely with a woman , of sharing his worries and his triumphs with her . Most important of all , he learns respect for her strength and intelligence , and in later years he will find it as natural to rely upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort ? as it was to depend upon his mother for guidance and consolation . As a result he never quite escapes from feminine influence . If French mothers and wives had more love for one another , one would suspect them of being united in a conspiracy to keep the male sex dependent upon women . V With all of their practicality , Frenchwomen are creatures of emotion . Witness the work of the two leading women writers , Colette and the Comtesse de Noailles , each of whom , in her own way , is exclusively concerned with feminine reactions to love . I should say , too , that the success of the fines de joie and the demi-mondaines who make a business of love , proves that Frenchwomen have an emotional range which Anglo-Saxon women lack as a general thing ; while the number of crimes passiannels committed by women ? and occasionally by women of the upper class ? goes to show , not that all Frenchwomen are capable of such acts , but that as a sex they are given to more violent emotions than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not very many enjoy Dora Russell 's " right to be happy " outside of marriage . The Comtesse de Noailles may declare " L'important n'est pas d'etre sage , c'est d'aller au-devant 1 ? 3 dieux " ( " The important thing is not to be wise , but to go to meet the gods . " ) Yet Frenchwomen , who should know their own sex , say that the average woman has so profound a sense of duty to her children and places so high a value on her foyer that she will not deceive her husband . The sensible Madame de Maintenons appear to be far more numerous than the pleasureloving de Montespans . Whether or not they are virtuous , Frenchwomen show no signs of being starved emotionally . This may be because their husbands know how to make them happy . Frenchmen have a reputation for being charming lovers : " c'est de leur nature " ( " they are born with the talent " ) a woman from another country once said to me . If this is true , it is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons may make a better and more lasting sexual adjustment than an American couple who to the best of their belief have married " for love . " Frenchwomen have been brought up to be coquettes and they do not forget the art even after they marry . They have , too , the satisfaction of living in a world where men recognize the vital fact of sex . In any sort of social intercourse between a man and a woman , even the most formal , the consciousness of sex is in the air . It may be only suggested by the touch of the man 's lips on the woman 's hand when he greets her , but it is none the less present . Yet the Frenchman does not relegate a woman to a purely physical sphere , as do the other men of the Latin race , and his gallantry is more truly respectful than that of our Southern men , for he shows by his attitude that he expects a woman to have wit and intelligence as well as physical charm . Love for the Frenchwoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American woman , since Frenchmen make as much of a cult of sentiment as Frenchwomen . One day when I was talking with a doctor about his philosophy of fatalism , he said quite casually , " Of course nothing really matters in life but love ? love for a woman , love for your children , or love for your parents . " An American man would hardly rate sentiment so high in his scale of values . This is perhaps the reason why Freudianism and other schools of psychoanalysis have gained so few converts in France : the women do not feel the need of it ; for whether they are wife , mistress , or friend , they know that men welcome them in their scheme of existence . The lot of the unmarried woman in France has been greatly improved since the War . All the professions are now open to women , and there is no such discrimination against them in the universities , as there still is in a number of our great institutions . Those who have chosen a professional or a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have not resented women 's invasion of their world , because they like to have them about them under all circumstances . The men love us in every sense of the word , if you please , " a brilliant young woman lawyer put it boldly . The women , for their part , have had the wisdom not to let their feminine charm be rubbed off and the tact not to injure the vanity of their confreres . Some married women have continued with their professions , and it must be admitted that they have shown as much ability in their work and more skill in managing their households than American professional women . A good many young women , furthermore , are now being educated by their families to earn their own livings , since existence has become so precarious a thing . But the number who choose to work after marriage is even smaller than in this country . There is virtue in knowing what one wants , and the Frenchwoman knows that a foyer is the most important thing in life to her . A friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet who can talk most intelligently about political and economic conditions in the different parts of the world where she has traveled with her husband , said to me quite frankly that her husband would be dissatisfied if she struck out and found an interest of her own , despite the fact that she has no children . Yet she is the type who in this country would he seeking some way of " expressing herself . " Frenchwomen generally are less restless than American women . They appear to feel no need for such an outlet as women 's clubs afford , and they are not intent upon pleasure and excitement . A young woman who loves gaiety will give up a yachting trip if she sees that her husband seriously disapproves of her leaving her child . Another young wife will keep the peace with a dictatorial motherin-law so long as her husband needs his parents ' financial help . Such sacrifices are almost second nature to a Frenchwoman , because her first concern is to " faire marcher le manage " ? make her marriage a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women because the latter have more money to spend and are not burdened with such heavy responsibilities . Yet French wives as a class seem to me far more contented than American wives . The same young woman who has traveled and who has observed American women in their own homes suggests that her countrywomen are happier because they " vibrate " more . Identified as they are with their husband 's and children 's interests , they may suffer as often as they rejoice , and yet they have the sense of living fully and of being needed greatly , which is , I suspect , the nearest to happiness that the feminine nature has come . As a feminist I should be sorry to admit that women can not follow their own line of development and at the same time be good wives and mothers . Such an evolution seems almost imperative for American women if they are not to become parasites , since our modern way of living has reduced the housewife 's activities to the minimum . Whether American marriage will gain or lose by the adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keyserling , it will be remembered , concluded that success in marriage depends upon a sense of " mutual destiny . " Undoubtedly this sense of working together is stronger when the wife concerns herself with her husband 's career rather than with her own . I am reminded of the phrase used by the wife of a French professor who was correcting her husband 's proofs when I went to see her . " Aprofessional marriage , " she said , " is an association , not a foyer . " Yet we could not , if we would , adopt the Frenchwoman 's attitude toward marriage , because the institution as it has developed here affords women a far more limited field of activity . Marriage has shaped Frenchwomen and given them character . Far from being submerged by it , they have emerged with very definite personalities . The old French proverb which says , " Ce que femme veut , Dieu veut " ( " Woman 's will is God 's will " ) reflects the secret conviction of most Frenchmen . Those who are intellectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country ? are " the superior sex , " while almost all Frenchmen will concede that women are capable of greater devotion and more sustained courage than are the members of their own sex ? who are magnificent in times of crisis but less to be depended upon from day to day . If the legislators have thus far refused women the vote it is not because they doubt their capacity , but because the sex has not demanded it with one voice , and because the Left-Wing majority of the Senate , being extremely anti-clerical , fears that the feminine vote will strengthen the position of the Church . Frenchmen are to be criticized for having failed to do justice to women in a legal sense . But they have not failed to do justice to them in a larger sense . It can not be a coincidence that the Virgin should be the presiding spirit in all the great French cathedrals , or that the history books should give the credit to a woman , Jeanne d'Are , for having been the first person to awaken the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country should be , not an Uncle Sam nor a John Bull , but a beautiful woman ? la France .
