txt Radio Singing Lessons . To the Editor of The New York Times : The New York Singing Teachers Association has been asked at various times for its opinion of the value of lessons in singing given over the radio . The association believes that these alleged lessons on the air are of no value whatsoever , except to ex- ploit and advertise the teacher giving such lesson . Whether these programs are put on as sustaining hours or as paid advertising , the various radio stations are equally responsible . Not only is the " listener-in " unable to determine his own imperfections and what he should follow of the instructions given , but the teacher broadcasting , not having heard the unseen student , is also unable to decide the needs of the student . The teaching of singing requires personal contact and attention and constant observation ; therefore we not only warn the public against such practice , but condemn this procedure as we do that of giving lessons by mail .
