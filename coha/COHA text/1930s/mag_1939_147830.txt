Most splendiferous museum piece in Philadelphia 's tradition-cluttered Independence Square is the twelve-story palace that houses 48-year-old Curtis Publishing Co . Most imposing thing about Curtis Publishing Co. is the combined circulation ( 8,406,431 ) of its publications : Saturday Evening Post , Ladies ' Home Journal , Country Gentleman , Jack &; Jill . Much less imposing are Curtis Publishing 's dividends to its 18,961 stockholders ( as of last Jan. 1 ) . <P> Like most other U. S. businesses , Curtis Publishing hit its earnings zenith in 1929 , when it reported a net of $21,534,265 , an all-time high for any publishing enterprise . Holders of its 7% preferred ( of which 722,714 of 900,000 shares are now held by the public ) got their dividends as they had for years . Holders of its common got $8 in dividends , felt they had a fine investment in a stock which was selling at $132 before the October crash . But by the depth of the depression in 1932 the dividend on common had dropped to $1 . Since then , no holder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1933 conservating Curtis Publishing had to cut its preferred dividend to nothing . <P> Except by comparison with its past records and its huge preferred dividend requirements , Curtis did not do badly in Depression or Recovery . But for 1938 Curtis was able to report a net of only $1,279,163 , declared only $1.50 for the year on its preferred . For the first nine months of this year its net was $1,921,618 . <P> By this time Curtis preferred stockholders had a thumping $12,339,273 coming to them in preferred dividends , and not even the sharp eyes of President Walter Deane Fuller could see the money in sight . Meanwhile the holders of the common , headed by the Bok family , descendants of the late great Curtis Founder Cyrus Herman Kotz-schmar Curtis ( who own 836,626 shares ) , were becoming impatient . <P> Early last month Curtis Publishing Co. stockholders received a proposition . It was a Plan . Its proposals : Let holders of 7% preferred agree to exchange up to two-thirds of the total shares held for a $4.50 prior preferred ; let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no rights to accrued dividends . This arrangement would cut gross preferred dividend requirements from $6,300,000 to $4,800,000 and lop off two-thirds of the accrued dividend bill ( saving well over $8,000,000 ) . <P> Quick to cry " Watch ! " were the preferred stockholders . Said a Wall Street brokerage house : " Preferred stockholders get nothing in return for their sacrifices ; common stockholders make no sacrifices in return for their benefits . " President G. W. Cox of Boston 's John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. did what no less potent stockholder could afford . He sent out far &; wide among preferred stockholders , lined up opposition votes as far afield as the Midwest . Many another big insurance company , holder of Curtis preferred , girded for the war .
