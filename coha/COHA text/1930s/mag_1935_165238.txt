THE AMERICAN DIPLOMATIC GAME- Drew Pearson and Constantine Brown- Doubleday , Doran ( $3 ) . <P> " From the Kellogg Pact to the Next World War , " might well be the subtitle of this knockabout , irreverent story of U. S. foreign policy over the past eight years . From the time of Calvin Coolidge 's troubles with an oil-seeking Great Britain to the days of Cordell Hull 's headache over the tariff , much of what Messrs . Pearson &; Brown have to tell is the common property of assiduous newsreaders . But many of the details have not been divulged until now . Some of the more sardonic ones : <P> 1 ) When a treaty to " outlaw war " as an instrument of national policy was proposed to Secretary of State Frank B. ( " Nervous Nellie " ) Kellogg , he scoffed the idea as just another dream of the professors . <P> 2 ) The Kellogg Pact never would have become a reality if Professor James T. Shotwell of Columbia University and the Carnegie Endowment and Salmon 0 . Levinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scenes for years . This manipulation was often accompanied by hearty dislike for each other , for Shotwell wanted to pull the U. S. into the League of Nations whereas Levinson wanted to keep the country out . Shotwell , say Brown &; Pearson , persuaded Nicholas Murray Butler to persuade the editors of the New York Times to whoop it up editorially for a Pact . Without this superinduced publicity , they say , the idea would never have got where it did . <P> 3 ) Herbert Hoover , although he had been Secretary of Commerce through two administrations , was unaware of the extent of Anglo-U . S. commercial conflict in South America until he went on his pre-inaugural cruise below the equator . <P> 4 ) When Charles Gates Dawes went to London as U. S. Ambassador , he forgot to confirm the invitation to Ramsay MacDonald to visit the U. S. for a talk with President Hoover . Edward Price Bell , a Chicago Daily News correspondent , had previously been sent by the President to sound out the Prime Minister unofficially on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> 5 ) President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson held up the MacDonald trip until a tentative agreement on naval armaments had been reached with Britain . Inasmuch as MacDonald badly needed the trip for political capital , it had the British Prime Minister dancing on pins and needles . <P> 6 ) Mr. MacDonald so far forgot himself when he finally saw President Hoover on the log over the Rapidan that he offered to dismantle the British naval bases in American waters . The offer was retracted in great alarm when London heard of it .
