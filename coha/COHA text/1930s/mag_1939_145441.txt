" The issue , " cried the Governor of Vermont , " is simply and solely the insistence of the Federal Government that it can take from us what it chooses , when it chooses , without any regard at all for our wishes or our rights . <P> ' " For more than a year I have warned that behind the flood control , behind the power development , was a deliberate attempt . . . for a little group of men to run things their way-good sometimes , bad sometimes-but always their way-forgetting that a check with the homefolks and their wishes is not only good practical horse sense but the very essence of democracy . . . . <P> " It is now put squarely up to us Vermonters . . . . We can fight or we can run . " <P> With these words Governor George D. Aiken last week stirred his legislature to come to the defense of Union Village . The Governor had a letter from Secretary of War Woodring directing that work begin on a Federal flood control dam on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Village and other towns for the loss of taxes on land condemned by the U. S. for the dam site . <P> " Maybe that 's selfish , " said the selectmen , " but we 'll lose about $1,000 a year , and that makes more taxes for the rest of us . " <P> In the snowy mountains at Montpelier , Vermont 's legislators-mostly Republicans as they have been throughout the New Deal , mostly farmers like their Governor , mostly thrifty taciturn New Englanders-made history : they cheered . They also petitioned Congress 1 ) to make Secretary Woodring approve the Ompompanoosuc contract , 2 ) to repeal that section of the Flood Control Act of 1938 which so invades States ' rights . Most noteworthy of all , they voted Governor Aiken $67,500 of Vermont 's carefully guarded money to fight the case through the U. S. Supreme Court if need be . <P> The issue was promptly broadened . Governor Aiken sped to Boston , met New England 's five other Governors . The Government 's flood control plans call for 32 dams in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's election-lined up solidly with Vermont . <P> In Washington , Secretary Woodring retorted that on Governor Aiken 's head would lie full blame for blocking the Federal flood control program in Vermont . Franklin Roosevelt sniffed that Governor Aiken would not have to spend his $67,500 fighting fund : if he would rather have States ' rights than Federal flood control , all right , the War Department would scratch Vermont off its list , pour its dollars and its dams into other States .
