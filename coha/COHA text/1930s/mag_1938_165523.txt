Non-Aggravation Policy <P> An unofficial war , local and exceedingly private , was waged last week on the Russo-Japanese frontier . During most of the week the Soviet Government officially ignored its existence . The Japanese , on the contrary , reported daily battles , accompanied by heavy barrages of artillery , air and tank attacks . <P> Having acknowledged so much , the Japanese allowed white war correspondents to approach the front , not close enough to see much fighting but close enough to see 37 nailed-up coffins said to contain the bodies of dead Russians , and the corpse of a big-boned white man in a grey-green uniform without distinguishing marks , said to be a Soviet pilot who had been shot down . <P> During the week , Mr. Saburo Ohta , third secretary of the Japanese embassy in Moscow , arrived in Tokyo , having crossed Siberia by railroad and taken ship at Vladivostok , not far from the battle line . Said he : " The central authorities of the Soviet Union are following a non-aggravation policy . After having been repulsed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During my trip through Siberia all was quiet and I saw no signs of disturbance in Vladivostok . " <P> Non-aggravation , unfortunately , had little to do with the case . The Tumen River forms the northeastern boundary of Korea , a country which Japan has held since 1910 when she snatched it from Russia 's aspiring grasp . Near the point where the Tumen flows into the sea lies Changkufeng Hill , a prominence which has unusual military importance since to the east it commands Posieta Bay which is of naval importance to Russia . To the south-west it commands the coast in the vicinity of Rashin , a Japanese naval base ( see map ) . <P> Japan had no claims north of the Tumen until she took over Manchukuo six years ago . The boundary of Manchukuo joins the Tumen somewhere near Changkufeng Hill and recently the Japanese decided that the hill would be nice to hold . The Manchukuoan border was easy to argue about , since it was fixed by the Sino-Russian treaty of 1886 of which Russia holds the only known copy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago the Japanese seized the hill . The Russians fought back and all last week Japanese communiqus were filled with accounts of the repulse of Russian attacks in force . The Japanese laid great emphasis on their " restraint " when Russian planes bombed the Rashin-Hsinking railway which , since it lies in Korea , is certainly in Japanese territory .
