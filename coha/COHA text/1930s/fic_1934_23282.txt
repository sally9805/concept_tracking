MISS CLISBEE 'S HEROIC LOVER A STORY BY L. M. HUSSEY M iss CLISBEE looked up into her employer 's face and prepared herself for a session of sex . It might last an hour ; it might go on without a stay for five or six hours ; its duration would depend on how much gin Bossom had drunk during the night . To gauge his hangover by his face was difficult . Miss Clisbee loathed the face but not the man ; of him she merely disapproved . He suffered from the mediocrity of most men ; he was poor in spirit . Out of lips that looked mummified came the first sentence . " He kissed her . " Miss Clisbee made pothooks in her notebook . " How 's that for a beginning , Miss Clisbee ? " Bossom demanded . " You see how the old Sex King goes at it ? No fumbling . You turn on the heat right away and you keep the blower going . Oh , God ! do I feel awful , Miss Clisbee ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want , Miss Clisbee ? Do you know what every writer ought to have ? " Miss Clisbee understood that for a few moments she was to be audience , not stenographer . She spoke in her audience voice . " What 's that , Mr. Bossom ? " " A patron , by God ! There never was such a thing as a real literary patron . You take some stinking moneybags and give him the idea that he'dlike to help literature . He meets me , and he says , ' Well , well , Mr. Bossom , so you 're an author ! You write a lot of tripe , I see . ' " ' Excuse me , Mr. Goldbucks , I know it 's tripe , but I 've my living to make . You see what I really want to do is finish my novel . Honest work . . I 've no time or spirit left for honest work . I ? " ' Bossom 's eyes , yellowish in the whites , glittered down upon Miss Clisbee . She was a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yellowish eyes were not far above the level of her own . This somber , explosive , thin little man looked like an oriental shopkeeper in the bitter moment of haggling over a customer . An Eastern air of mad fatality seemed all about him . The air and his manner and his looks contrived an illusion , for in his veins there was not a single drop of Eastern blood . " Now what do you think Gold-bucks ought to say ? " he demanded of Miss Clisbee . She knew that he would supply his own answer . " III tell you what he ought to say , Miss Clisbee . No patron ever did say it , but III tell you what he ought to say . He ought to say , ' Bossom , you 're a liar . You do n't want to write the tripe you do write , and you do n't want to write your novel , and you do n't want to write anything else . There 's one thing all writers loathe doing , and that 's writing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer is sure to take it . Now , Bossom , I 'm going to become your patron . I 'm going to make you happy in spite of the fact that you 're a writer . Every week from now on I 'm sending you a check for one hundred dollars  --  on one , unbreakable condition . You 're never to write another word ! Understand ! Not another word ! God help you if I catch you bootlegging any words . There are too many words in this world . As a patron of the art of literature , I 'm going to have Iess of them . ' " His eyes still glittered . As she knew she must , Miss Clisbee laughed a little . When she laughed her face grew rounder and was pretty . " Now where were we ? Oh , yes : He kissed her . You 've got that ? He kissed her . He kissed flower lips , well-remembered lips , that were all the more glamorous for their memories , lips like  --  oh , Lord God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring blossoms , " she suggested . " Very good , Miss Clisbee . Very original . Put that down : spring blossoms . We have n't used that one since yesterday . Why do n't you try some of this stuff on your own hook instead of working for me ? You 'd probably believe in it and be a howling success . How do I know you do n't believe in it ? Fact is , you 've worked for me for three years , and I do n't know anything at all about you . Used to think you were cut out to be an old maid . I 'm not so sure . You 're secretive . For all I know , right now you may have some poor blighter tumbling somersaults over you . Why not ? " Her misery was profound ; it was heartbreaking . For a week she had wrapped it in her aloofness and made its presence as unguessable as her former warm hopes . And this terrible little man with his clattering tongue suddenly made her misery desperate , unbearable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much gin had finally softened his brain . He saw three quick tears splash and spread on her notebook . He disbelieved in their reality , and yet there they were , real tears , sinking into the paper like ink into a blotter . Miss Clisbee was crying . Bossom had no idea what to do . He began to look for a glass of water but could find no glass . The place was always a shambles . He came upon a whisky bottle with some liquor still in the bottom of it , and this he tilted over his lips and took a long drink . When he looked at Miss Clisbee , she was patting her eyes with a handkerchief . The lids were a little red ; otherwise she had recovered her usual face and manner . " You must forgive me , " she said . " Better tell me about it . " " No , I wo n't tell you about it . Why should I ? " " Do you good . " She looked at him thoughtfully . He was poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could be kind . Was it possible that he had any imagination ? " Maybe it would , " she said quietly . She told him as much as she thought a sex king might understand . She explained nothing of her notions about men , although these made her adventure significant . She said that a month before she had gone alone to a Stadium concert . It was a warm evening ; she wore a print dress covered with yellow flowers on blue stems sprouting blue leaves . When you looked at her you found her contradictory ; that is , she seemed one thing or another according to your mood . A man in a party mood , ready for night clubs , taxicabs , and noise , would pass his eye over tall Miss Clisbee , find her spinsterish , and turn his glance elsewhere . A man whose mood expressed less elementary needs would look at her twice and examine her . Her body was a little angular , but there was a kind of sleek vitality in her movements . The twisting line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part at the side of her head , crossing her high forehead and hiding all but the lobe of an ear , was graceful . It was , alI in all , a graceful face , a graceful head , gracefully held on a longish neck . Given the proper mood , you might look at that face many times without growing bored with it . But it would never startle you , either by its ugliness or beauty . Miss Clisbee took her place , watched the players , listened to the noise of tuning . The bull-fiddlers leaned over their viols and scraped out gruff growls . Clarinetists tooted cadenzas ; on the violins the A-strings sounded ; a harpist plucked arpeggios . The orchestra was about to play Schtinberg 's ugly tone-poem , " PeIleas et Melisande , " but Miss Clisbee was prepared for an emotional experience and would find the tone-poem , even the muted tubas , beautiful . They played the tone-poem , and Miss Clisbee found it beautiful . Then a young man sitting beside her turned and said : " I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summed him up in a swift estimate . Unknown men did not often speak to her , but sometimes they did , and when they did she usually ignored them . She believed she could quickly tell by the fare of a man what a man was . And what she believed most men to be exasperated and chilled her . This man was small , swarthy , black-haired , dark-eyed , sharp-featured , and sincere . He looked a little ill or else a little feeble Iike a convalescent . She said , " I liked it . " " What I have against it , " he said , " is the subject . Debussy did very little with the same subject , and this SchOnberg has done less . " " It seems to me , " objected Miss Clisbee , " that a composer or any other artist can pick his own subject  --  whatever subject he pleases . " " Will you have a cigarette ? " " No , thank you . " " I 'd like to explain to you what I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground after a rain ? They leave a little track of slime behind them . Kids pour salt over them , and they melt . Now you take  --  oh , well , you take a tiger . You would n't say that a slug is as successful a creation as a tiger . God experimented with both of them , did as well as he could with a slug , but he had a poor subject . If he was to do it all over again , he 'd probably leave out working on slugs . A tiger is heroic , You 've got to have an heroic conception or your music misses fire . These Maeterlinck characters are n't heroic ; they 're just a distressed crowd out of a psychopathic ward . Composers ought to have sense enough to let them alone . Maybe you see what I mean . " It was strange he used the word " heroic . " That was one of Miss Chsbee 's words . " Well , you make me think , " she said . " I like your idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea . Do you come up here often ? " " Pretty often , yes , when it 's not too hot . " " Will you tell me your name ? Mine 's Lounsbery , Sidney Louns-bery . " " Agnes Clisbee . " " I think I 've heard of you . " " No , you have n't either . There 's nothing on earth you could have heard about me . I 'm a stenographer . I do n't work in an office , but I 'm a stenographer , I take dictation from an author . " " Oh , from an author , eh ? Does he pay you your salary ? Most authors I know never have a red cent . I make out better than those writing fellows . I do ornamental iron work and some wood carving . Big iron gates and that sort of thing . Like to look at some of my stuff ? I do it very well ; it 's interesting . This concert will be over by half-past ten . You come along with me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say , Miss Clisbee ? " She stopped . The brass choirs of the orchestra played the opening theme of the prologue to " Pagliacci . " The woodwinds replied . A soloist was to sing . It was light and pleasant music , but Miss Clisbee was not listening . How naturally she and the animated little Sidney Lounsbery had met and talked ! Their meeting was like a fated thing ; that was it , she thought  --  Iike a fated thing . They met and talked and were intimate at once , because the event had been meant for them . You were not superstitious if you believed that certain meetings were meant for you . You had to believe that something was meant for you or there would be no hope in your heart to urge on its beating . Your heart would stop , for , obviously enough , most meetings were without meaning . It was a bit outrageous that he had asked her to come at once and look at his work . No , it was not outrageous ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their meeting . She would not go . Yes , she would go . . . . Bossom grinned , and his yellow eyes glittered maliciously . Miss Clisbee decided that it would he unfair to consider him an evil man , for he could be kind . But he had low instincts and very little imagination . His trouble was this : he was poverty-stricken , poverty-stricken in spirit . " Well , well , Miss Clisbee ! " he interrupted her . " A while ago I told you that I knew nothing about you . You 're secretive . Now I 'd never have guessed that you 'd go to a concert and get yourself picked up by a blacksmith . And then trot off the same evening to the blacksmith 's shop . Very compromising , my dear lady , very compromising ! It 's the sort of thing I write about , only a little more fantastic . Then I suppose he insulted you . " " No , it 's not at all the sort of thing you write about , " said Miss Clisbee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grille that he was making for a banker who was building a chapel in his house . She was reminded of older days ; this was beautiful handicraft . She told her new friend that it was beautiful . She was very glad that she had come with him to the studio . " Yes , " he said , " it 's good work ; it 's very good work . Nowadays I do n't get a chance to do as much of it as I 'd like to . I have to fool round with other things . " " Why do you have to fool round with other things ? " " I have to live . The fellows do n't have as much money as they used to have . They 're not buying . It was better before the War  --  and right after . " Something grew a little rigid in Miss Clisbee 's spirit . " I should think you 'd do the work you want to do , " she said . " Do n't you ever smoke ? Ca n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , you might think that , Miss Clisbee . Agnes . . . . I 'm going to call you Agnes . I used to think I 'd always do exactly what I wanted to do . But they knock the spirit out of you . I mean people , things that happen to you . I tried it too far , and they jammed rue in prison . " Her face relaxed into bewilderment , and Lounsbery laughed . " Oh , it was n't over my work , although the same principle applies . It was about going to war . I objected . I said ' no . ' They put me in Leavenworth . It was n't funny . We wo n't talk about it . " What remained of chill in Miss Clishee 's emotions and what remained of bewilderment were replaced by a glow that amounted almost to exultation . Oh , surely , that meeting in the Stadium was intended , was fated ! For here , at last , was a man able to do the brave and difficult thing rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been easier , for example , to take up arms than to refuse uniform and rifle . Men were roosters ; they loved to strut ; they were forever puffing out their chests in heroic attitudes . Their weakness for mock heroics  --  that was part of their poverty of spirit . So the passionately romantic Miss Clisbee , who had a nature able to deny itself love when love fell short of passionate romance , said to her friend : " We wo n't talk about it . But you see , we do n't need to because I understand . That was brave of you , you must let me say that much . They called the ones who went to war ' heroes . ' They had to go to war . You ca n't pass a law to make heroes . " Lounsbery 's black eyes were very alive . And his cheeks were flushed . He really , thought Miss Clisbee , looked ill , looked feverish . In the prison what had they done to this brave man ? Oh , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage like his own to be there had died there . He had come out alive , but she could see plainly that he was very ill . She wanted to cherish him , she wanted to heal him , she wanted to give him her own vitality . Never in her life had Miss Clisbee smiled with provocation at a man or , passing on the street , given any man an inviting glance . She was incapable of these trifling acts , so naturally performed by thousands of other women , because she was too serious for trifling , There was very little humor in her . Courage and humor are seldom joined . She had courage . Courage is foolhardy . It might have occurred to Miss Clisbee that she was possibly unattractive to Sidney Lounsberythat is , unattractive in her face and body . Being foolhardy , she had no room in her head for such a thought . She was unable to flirt with a man , but she was able to take one in her arms . She turned to Sidney and put her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoop a trifle to kiss him . " You were too quick for me , " he said . " I 'm ashamed . " " I was too quick for you ? " " Yes , you were . I wanted to kiss you myself . But I was a little afraid of you . " A little afraid of her  --  that made no sense ; it sounded comic . However , she was too serious to do more than smile . And her emotions had suddenly fatigued her ; she sank down on the cushions of an armchair . Vaguely she noticed that the arms felt gritty against her fingers and palms . He lived in disorder ; he needed little things done for him ; he could n't properly care for himself . Now he leaned on the chair arm and stroked her hair . " I think you 're very lovely , " he said . " You 're wrong , Sidney . " " Yes , you 're a lovely woman . " " Do you think so ? I 'm not lovely . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney . We 're going to be in Iove with each other . " " We are . " She told some of this to Bossom because he had seen tears drop on her notebook . You could n't keep all that misery inside of yourself . Telling about it eased the stress of it . Tears had dropped down on her notebook , for after knowing him a month , she had quarrelled with Sidney Lounsbery . She accused him of deceiving her . The accusation did not contain the usual , vulgar reference ; Miss Clisbee was not talking of another woman . She was talking of a deception much less obvious , yet obvious enough . That first night in his studio she made a decision to do something for his comfort . Sidney submitted to what she did because he cared enough for this unusual woman to be tolerant . She made him abominably uncomfortable , while he kept his complaints to himself . She cleaned up his quarters ; site put things away . It may be curious , but a disorderly man likes disorder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . What she did for her lover was probably pretty exasperating . And she pestered him about his health . He was forever catching cold , so Miss Clisbee set about , as she put it , to build him up . Eggs were beaten into milk ; he found this a slippery , loathsome mixture , but out of his fondness for Miss Clisbee he summoned the fortitude to swallow it . His general diet was surveyed and regulated . Here , however , he was spared the worst , for Miss Clisbee was too sensible in practical concerns togo in for fads ; there was no distressing nonsense about starches , proteins , vitamins , and calories . It was irritating to be regulated , put in order , yet it was also amazing and wonderful . Lounsbery understood that Miss Clisbee loved him deeply , yes , ecstatically . The power of her love lifted her spirit to a plane of sustained exaltation . So what he saw was not one woman but two women . There was the exalted woman and there was the practical woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazingly , compatible . Getting order into Lounsbery 's exterior life was no trifling task . She tackled the gross problems first . They had known each other a month before she had come to such a fine detail as arranging a jumbled kitchen midden of letters , documents , and odd papers . Bossom was always drunk over the week-end , so Miss Clisbee ordinarily had Monday free . It was on a Monday after noon that she discovered the photograph . Lounsbery was not in the studio . Alone there , Miss Clisbee stared at a snapshot of her /over , who wore the olive-drab uniform of an infantry private in the United States Army . Then he had lied to herl Her cheeks went white . For she was as shocked by the sight of Lounsbery in that uniform as she might have been by the sight of Lounsbery in the arms of another woman . You center your love upon some outstanding quality you have found or it may be imagined , in your lover ; and then all the qualities of your love cluster about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love . The discovery of your lover in the arms of another woman destroys a symbol of fidelity . Miss Clisbee 's discovery of her lover in a uniform destroyed a MISS CLISBEE 'S HEROIC LOVER symbol of heroism . And unhappily for Miss Clisbee , love and the lover had necessarily to be heroic . Weakened by emotion as on the first night in that place , she sank into the armchair . The wood of the arms was smooth , polished , under her fingers and palms . In the hall she heard Lounsbcry 's step and she turned her white face to the door . He came in and said : " What is it ? " " This , " she said . Lounsbery glanced at the snapshot . For a moment his black eyes were lusterless with bewilderment . Then suddenly he felt that he understood . " Oh ! " he cried . " I see . I understand . It 's not what you think , darling . You think I lied to you , do n't you , darling ? No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , darling : I never told you the whole story . Sooner or later you 'd have heard it . It 's not some- ' thing I like very much to talk about . " " Better tell me now . " " Yes , tell you now , of course . You see , I refused to be drafted ; remember , I told you that , darling ? They jammed me into Leavenworth . I was stubborn , I thought I could do as I pleased , I actually thought I could beat them . But it was n't possible to beat them . One man , one man alone , ca n't beat a whole nation . I wo n't tell you what they did to me . You can imagine ; you read about those things . If you 're humiliated enough and tormented enough , I do n't care what your spirit is to begin with , they 'll break it . You wake up some morning and you find you do n't have any spirit . It 's gone . You say to yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care ; you 'd as lief do one thing as another . They came round and said , ' Well , how about it now ? ' I was past caring . I said , That was in New Jersey . moment and magical at another , and just at this moment Sidney Lounshery had uttered magic . His words entered into her spirit like torches ; they lighted her understanding . Oh , it was true , there was something real in what she felt for him ! The hero was gone ; no longer was there a symbol to focus her love . Her emotions were disordered , spread about , but they remained ; her love remained . " I love you , " she told him , " and I 'm coming to you . " She went to him and found him ill in his bed . The next day she telephoned to Bossom and told him it was impossible for her to come to work , perhaps for several days . Bossom saw nothing of Miss Clisbee for a week . When at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving up to tell her , for her expression closed his lips . At once he understood that she had experienced some astounding adventure . What it might have been escaped him . She looked as if she had suffered intolerably yet had been somehow exalted by her suffering . She took up her notebook , and they went to work . They worked until the middle of the afternoon . " That 's all , " said Bossom , closing a sentence . " And thank God ! What a foul trade ! You can go now , Miss Clisbee . " Adjusting her hat , she stood at the mirror . Bossom stared at her and said : " You do n't mean to tell me you 've had another crazy quarrel ? If you have , forget it . You settled one quarrel ; you can settle another . " " This ca n't be settled . It 's over . " " Do n't be a fool , Miss Clisbee . " " I 'm not a fool . I tell you this ca n't be settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . He 's dead . " Bossom could find nothing to say . It was Miss Clisbee who spoke . " Pneumonia , " she said . And after a pause she began to speak as if she were reciting , as if she had memorized the words . There was a kind of stagestruck agitation in her voice . " You see , " she explained , " he was once a soldier . He was sick and never got to France . I know all about him ; he was a brave man . If he 'd been able to get to France , they 'd have found out he was a brave man . I know what he would have done ; he was gallant . When he died I bought a flag . " She stopped . " I do n't know what you mean , Miss Clisbee . " " Just that . I bought a flag . It was the biggest flag I could buy , and I wrapped him in it with my own hands . " So she had recovered her necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . It sounded silly to Bossom . He wanted to laugh . She had no humor , she was a fool . No , damn it , he did n't want to laugh . It was silly , but it was something else . Now when she wrapped that flag round the little blighter she probably stood up , looked away , and then saw her hero marching . By Heaven ! there was a story in that ! She saw her hero marching ... if he was not a brave man , she , at least , was a brave woman . . . she had brave dreams . ... There was a story in that . Some day , if someone would let him write something serious , he 'd write it .
