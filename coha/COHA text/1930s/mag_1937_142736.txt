In the fishing village of Lossiemouth in Scotland 's Morayshire , two raw , porridge-fed youngsters worked and played side by side , developed into firm friends . The name of one was James Ramsay MacDonald , the other 's Alexander Grant . MacDonald 's uncle and Grant 's father were both guards on the Highland Railway . All that was 60 years ago . <P> Both lads rose in the world . From schoolteacher and invoice clerk , MacDonald became in 1924 Britain 's first Laborite Prime Minister . Grant started as a baker 's boy in an Edinburgh biscuit company , became general manager of McVitie &; Price , Ltd. and wealthy enough to give Scotland a National Library . <P> The two friends remained close through the years .

Three months later Prime Minister MacDonald successfully advised King George V to confer a baronetcy on Grant . In the House of Commons , His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition rose savagely to suggest that the Prime Minister had done this to repay a private debt . Correspondence between the Laborite and the Tycoon was produced showing that the Prime Minister had argued for the maintenance of " his simplicity of habit , " that Grant had argued that the Prime Minister should " save his strength for the nation . " Touched by this proof of honest friendship , the Opposition dropped the issue . <P> Sir Alexander Grant died last month . His will was probated last week . Under its terms Ramsay MacDonald will receive for the rest of his life the income from $200,000 , about $7,500 a year . To Ramsay MacDonald this windfall is happily not so all-important financially as loyal , generous Sir Alexander had thought it would be . By an act of Parliament , passed after the will was made , Mr. MacDonald is entitled to a pension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because fortnight ago he decided to stay in the House of Commons rather than accept an earldom ( TIME , June 7 ) , he will get an additional $3,000 a year as long as he is a member of Parliament .
