The showing will reflect the improvement in consumption of steel which started late in July and continued throughout last month . The report will be public at noon today . Further improvement in deliveries for the industry during September is indicated by the American Iron &; Steel Institute reportshowing ingot production for September 9 week at 49.7% , the highest rate since the week of February 11 . A week ago the rate was 45.8% , so that the increase amounts to 3.9 points , or 8.5% . While the shipments for the last two days of the month are still to be recorded , it is not likely that they ? will affect the final report to any extent . In fact further improvement in the daily deliveri vs for- those two days would not be unususi , of'the conditions existing in the steel industry generally . That there would be an increase in snipmerits by the Steel corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ingot production . which averaged 48.84% for the industry in August , an increase of 9.40 points , over the 39.44% rate recorded for July . Aditional Working Day in August The showing of shipments for August was aided to some extent by the fact that there was one additional working day in that month over July .

Bright Outlook for Second Half That the Steel corporation and all other producers will do much better in the last half of this year than in the corresponding period of 1934 seems to be taken as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse from what they were a year ago , with consumers buying actively and taking good deliveries from week to week . Shipments of U. S. Steel in August , 1934. amounted to only 378,023 tons . Users of steel were slow in taking tonnage because they had overbrought in the second quarter and took deliveries to avoid an increase in quotations which had been announced . This condition was reflected throughout the latter months of last year . There . is no such situation existing at present . Prices have been stabilized and steel consumers are taking the steel as it is needed in their manufacturing activities . For that reason it is the general view that the situation in the industry today is more healthy than it has been in a long time . At this time last month the industry was at 48.1% . In the corresponding week of 1934 , ingot output was at 20.9% , which was an increase of 2.5 points , or 13.6% , over the preceding Labor Day week , when the industry recorded its low for the year 1934. at 18.4% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times since June 18 , 1934 , namely in the week of January 28 , last , with 52.5% , in the week of February 4 , last , with 52.8% , and in the week of February 11 , last , with 50.8% . The downtrend which started after February 11. was quite steady and carried the ingot rate down to 32.8% for the week of July 1 . which included Independence Day , recognized as a legal holiday in the industry . Since that time there have been progressive increases , Interrupted only by the approach of Labor Day which caused shut downs in some plants . Since the week of July 1 , last , the increase in production has amounted to 16.9 points , or equivalent to more than 513 , ; . % . Steel authorities look for further gains in the corning weeks due to the expansion in demand from the automotive and affiliated industries in connection with new models now being produced .
