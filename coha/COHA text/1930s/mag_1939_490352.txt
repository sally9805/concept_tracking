NOTE JUST TWENTY YEARS AFTER- THE ADOPTION OF THE NATIONAL PROHIBITION AMENDMENT : Wh enever we look around at our friends , we are surprised at the number of unbroken test tubes there were left over from the Noble Experiment . SOMETHING between a thousand dollars and a million and a half was pilfered by station agents of the Independent line over the past three years . This explains some king we had never quite understood before  --  the sly , intent look on the face of the man in the booth as he carefully bounced our quarter on the shelf to sec if it was good . " No use taking home a slug , " he was probably saying . WE always look searchingly at the VI ' photographs of newspaper columnists , trying to learn what kind of man or woman it is whose lightest word is gospel to so many . We are sorry to say that we 've never arrived at any successful generality . The people who write columns look very much like anybody else . If they have any common and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye  --  an effect that as a technician we know only- too well can be achieved with one adroit pick of the engraver 's tool . We have , however , noticed one interesting thing about them . The photographs are changed from time to time and almost invariably the change is for the better . Heywood Braun in our long acquaintance with him has progressed from a matted , untidy sort of man with a rather unreliable air to a Roman senator , and Westbrook Pegler , who used to look like a spoiled and petulant boy , seems wiser now a little tired perhaps , but noble and kind . We have also observed that everybody seems to be getting thinner , making us wonder if syndicated thought may not fine a man down , like slag in a crucible . In any case , the change everywhere is in the direction of the ideal ; everywhere , that is , except in the New York Post , where we come on a perplexing phenomenon . Miss Anne Hirst , who advises the lovelorn on behalf of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses apparently as the whim strikes her . On Monday , for instance , she will appear as a white-haired matron of perhaps fifty , with a tolerant , worldly look , and then , on Tuesday , she will be a courageous , dreamy girl of twenty-five with soft brown hair sweeping back over her ears . We have no objection to this personally , even finding that it makes for variety in a monotonous world , but sometimes we ca n't help worrying about the lovelorn . A woman helplessly torn between an advantageous marriage and it career on the stage would find her whole future banging on which Miss Hirst happened to get her letter . The tired worldling would certainly advise her to ding to security , however uninspiring ; the eager girl would tell her to follow her heart no matter where it Ted . The whole thing seems very arbitrary to us , and we are not going to have much ' confidence in anything we read in the Post until somebody down there figures out which Miss Hirst is handling love . TNSTEAD of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your hand some morning , dig into the package and find the Interest-in ! : Card for Children , Every Shredded Wheat package contains an Interesting Card , and each Interesting Card consists of a picture story for boys and girls  --  the picture to be colored by the child with crayon . The most recent one we have come across is called " Spain . " The picture shows a girl wearing a shawl and a boy carrying a basket of olives . The legend runs ; SPAIN The little madonna with her bright shawl and the comb in her hair  --  the two children in an olive grove  --  where could this be but Spain ? Spain is a sunny country . Put plenty of yellow on the ground to make it look like sunshine . Now color the rest of this picture as you think it ought to look . We are lucky in having this break-fast-food history of the times to offset the Associated Press running account of what goes on . Color the ground yellow , children , while the coloring is still good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacant man , just bound for the water-cooler . From a transom on our left came a voice , brisk and impatient at the telephone . " Listen , " it said . " Just try to get this straight . All I want to know is how many volts this electric eel can generate . Never mind the rest of it ; just give me his voltage . " A very good question , too , we thought , and went on our way . Outside another room two office boys , bearing important dispatches , had stopped to argue about matters closer to their hearts . " Lou Nova would knock his ears off , " said one . " He 'd moider him , that 's all . " " Yeah ? " said the other contemptuously . " Who did he ever beat ? Farr . Barlund . Them bums . " " Bums is right , sonny , " we murmured , and still walked tin . At the watercooler a gentle , smallish man we 'd never seen before was talking to one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying , " I would n't try the sweet peas . Personally I 've never bad a very good experience with peas . The damn birds just dig them up . " We had our drink and started hack along the ball . Passing the file room , we could hear a young lady speaking softly to her telephone : " Hello , Harry ? Meet you the same place around six ? O.K. ' Bye . " There it all is , we thought as we finally settled hack at our desk : a little work , a little play , a little sorrow , a little love . Our world suddenly seemed to us compact and safe  --  reassuringly permanent , reasonably safe from invasion , like a novel by E. M. Delafield . We were sitting there contentedly when a shadow fell across our typewriter . It was the window-washer , skirting the awful gap between our window and the next , a dear drop below him of eighteen stories , nothing above him but his God . He greeted us pleasantly through the pane , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in isolation when strange faces peer in his windows ; no man can look at a window-washer , separated from eternity merely by a leather strap , and dream all men are safe . ? INCIDENTAL , INTELLIGENCE : In Chicago you can go dancing at the Granada Ballroom for the Middle-Aged . And at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 110th Street , New York City , is a Spanish dance hall called La Casa de los Happy Boys . In Bedford , New Hampshire , is a riding school called the Back-Acres Riding Club . The slogan of the Bradshaw Company , which makes pop-corn poppers and packages , is " Keep in good health for the World 's Fair by eating plenty of Pop Corn . " Firm of the week : The Excess Management Corporation , 116 John Street . " The Dictator " A HOLLYWOOD associate of ours has done what he could to straighten out the current rumors about Charlie Chaplin 's next picture . The definite facts are that the picture will be called " The Dictator , " that it will deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impersonate Hit-ler . The Hollywood correspondent of Paris-Soir first printed the announcement , last November , and since then there have been all sorts of reports , official , semi-official , and Louella Parsons . That lady said Chaplin had been persuaded to tone down his original idea so as not to cause further persecution of German Jews . Chaplin says that a few people have given him that argument , but that most of the letters he has received have been encouragement to go ahead and give Hitler the works , which he plans to do . Hitler wo n't be named , but there 's only one dictator with that kind of mustache . Chaplin 's favorite rumor is the , one that the Messrs . Pearson and Allen printed in their " Washington Merry-Go-Round " column . He said at a dinner that it was going to be " a Weber and Fields sort of thing , " and they had him planning just to direct the film , with Weber and Fields appearing as Hitler and Mussolini . The German press has denounced the project as another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of flux , but it 's pretty certain that Chaplin will have a dual role  --  the dictator , and a prisoner in a concentration camp who looks like him . Mistaken identity , etc. , etc . He has definitely decided that he will talk in " The Dictator " but does n't yet know how much talking he 'll do or what kind of voice he 'll use . His normal voice is out of character . For his speaking debut , he 's inclined to favor what actors call a " slide " ? a sort of Ed Wynn voice . He 's been rehearsing Hitler 's mannerisms and people who have seen him at work say he has them cold . Chaplin 's movie wo n't be the first in the anti-Nazi field . Warner Brothers will win that honor with a film tentatively called " Confessions of a Nazi Spy , " which was inspired by the recent trial of German spies here in New York . It 's expected to be a more or Less routine melodrama , with the exception that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well pictures to date the political background has been only hinted at . M-G-M have dusted off the script of " It Ca n't Happen Here , " which they bought and shelved three years ago . One of the principal factors in this revival in interest is the fact that neither Italy nor Germany has been a good market for movies since the new regime started , and the producers think that perhaps they might as well make a clean break . Two Speculations TNTO the life , d a matron we know A came the not unusual problem of the colored maid who dips freely into the family liquor supply . Having neither the strength nor the conviction to approach the matter directly , the lady finally said to Laura , with what she considered impeccable diplomacy , " I wonder why our liquor has been running so low lately . " " And I , " Laura said amiably , " have been wondering when you-all would get round to asking me that . " Artist-Painter THE neighbors of 0 . A. Renne in the shanty colony above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist-painter , " to distinguish him from the other residents who do humbler jobs with a paint brush . Mr. Renne is the man who , two years ago , caused considerable astonishment in local art circles by having his first one-man show at the age of seventy-five . He was introduced to the gallery folk by an excited artist who had found him painting on the Palisades . In his third show , which you can still see if you hurry around to the Marie Harriman Gallery , he has progressed from his earlier still-life studies to rather dreamy , impressionistic landscapes , most of them sketched on the left hank of the Hudson . At the Harriman Gallery they call him " the lyric poet of the Palisades , " and one critic exclaimed that he was an American Picasso . The American Picasso was horn at the corner of Broome and Mott Streets . His father , who came of Huguenot stock , was a machinist in the Singer Sewing Machine plant . The young Renne was educated in the public schools here . He had his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and on during the next sixty-five years , at Cooper Union , the Gotham Art School , the Art Students ' League , Adelphi Academy , and the Beaux Arts Institute . Before the World War he worked as a cutter in a paper-box factory . During the war he served as a First-Class Camoufleur and supervised sixty men in the disguising of merchant vessels . For this he was paid $200 a month , which he says is the most he has ever made out of painting . After the war , now a widower , he moved over to Jersey , and there he has lived ever since . He has got along , sparsely but happily , on the savings of his war days , eked out with the proceeds of an occasional odd job . Incidentally , his water colors now on display , all priced at $75 , have been selling rather well . Renne at seventy-seven is tall , broad , bald , ruddy-checked , and brisk as a grasshopper . His camp , a neat one-room structure with brown paper over the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of chairs , a couch , and an oak sideboard piled high with provisions and painting materials . The upper half of a riverward window is unpapered , providing a fine view of the Presbyterian Medical Center . Mornings , Mr. Renne usually walks into Edgewater , a mile or so away , to get his groceries and his mad and to chat with the local shopkeepers . After lunch he paints , wandering along the Palisades until he finds a scene that pleases him . He wo n't say exactly where he goes . " Do you think I want to have dozens of students around ? " he asks . It 's getting harder and harder for him to find good places , because of the rising tide of middle-class civilization in his neighborhood . " They 've ruined almost all the places of beauty around here , " he has been known to say . " The WPA can do lots more than God can , and quicker , unfortunately . " Suspicious Person THE Profile of Paul Draper which we printed several weeks ago omitted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G-men . Returning to New York after a vacation in Mexico , he was called on by a pair of steely-eyed government agents . One of them , his hand held menacingly in his coat pocket , guarded the door of Draper 's apartment ; the other , without bothering to remove his hat , settled down to grill the somewhat bewildered tap-dancer . A series of more or less adroit questions established the fact that Draper had just driven back from Mexico , that his car was a Mercedes roadster , that he had spent the night at this and that hotel and stopped at this and that filling station or lunch wagon . The Draper dossier was , in fact , quite complete  --  obviously an expensive job , considered in terms of G-man power . It turned out , after a good deal of stern questioning , that the federal government had been worried about a telegram Draper had sent back to Mexico City from somewhere in Texas . He had been courting a pretty but obdurate young lady and had thought to cover his retreat by sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLONDES ARE WAITING FOR ME AT THE HOLLAND TUNNEL " The telegraph company had reported the matter to J. Edgar Hoover , and the G-men , enchanted at the thought of trapping a white slaver who drove a Mercedes and posed as a wealthy tap-dancer , had sprung into action . " Come out , you yellow rat ! " they snarled , covering him with riot guns  --  no , that was another time . Anyway , crime does n't pay . Sterile USUALUSUALLY , when we see on the LY , a pretty , brightly uniformed young lady with a handbag , we hang around her in the hope of getting a sample of chewing gum or cigarettes . After a number of disappointments , we discovered that more often than not these Maedchen in Uniform are shock troopers of the Hygienic Phone Service . They wear blue uniforms , military capes , Legion caps , and Sam Browne belts , and patrol office buildings , wiping out telephonic germs at a charge running between five and ten cents an instrument . This project was started two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he in the insurance business . Telephone hygiene dates back to 1904 , when the Swiss health officers , in an attempt to control tuberculosis , concocted an antiseptic for use in mouthpieces . This was taken up commercially in England some years ago . News of the idea was brought to America by Tom Patricola , the buck-and-wing dancer . Mr. Morris went into it on his advice , and now employs forty-three girls and cleans thousands of phones a week . Mr. Morris was once in the Navy and one of his partners used to be in the Army , which accounts for the military flavor of the organization . There are two kinds of workers , the Army and the Marines . The Marines , fifteen in nutnher , do the selling ; they make the rounds of offices , demonstrate how telephones can he cleaned , and sign up the clients . There are twenty-eight girls in the Army , and they do the actual cleaning . The first cleaning of a telephone takes about twenty minutes , including scrubbing , varnishing , and the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrument free of bacteria . There 's a brokerage house downtown which claims to have decreased colds among customers ' men by seventy per cent , no less , with hygienic telephones . They regard this as a big step forward . The Hygienic Phone Service also operates in Boston , Philadelphia , and Wilrningt at , and expects to descend on Pittsburgh in the near future . " A wonderful town for us , " Mr. Morris says . We got him back on the subject of the girls and learned that they must be attractive , high-school graduates , and between 100 and 115 pounds in weight . They take a thorough physical examination and a two weeks ' training course before they start their careers . They work in three shifts a day , some going to offices before the employees arrive , some staying late . Each shift , before going on duty , is examined by Miss McNally , top sergeant in the Marines , and Miss Jameson , who holds a similar post in the Army . The girls are supposed to he able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No private houses are solicited . " After all , " Mr. Morris told us , " you never can tell about a bachelor . " Future Reference COUPLE of weeks ago a stern old gentleman boarded an uptown express at Wall Street and settled down to read his newspaper . It was the Post , and the biggest headline was " CHAMBERLAIN LEAVES AMID RIOT . " The old gentleman scanned the headline and the appended story , then carefully tore out the last word , " RIOT , " leaving plenty of margin . He folded it carefully , put it in his wallet , and got off at Seventy-second Street , bent on goodness knows what . Crow ATRAINED crow named Jackie , you may or may not know , is sharing the limelight at the Rainbow Room with Mary Martin , whose heart is not her own . The crow 's owner is Friedrich Martin ( nn relation whatever to Mary ) and we met him and Jackie the other night between shows . Professionally , they 're known as Martinet and his Trained Crow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international . Martin had no idea it had an unflattering meaning until we brought the subject up . We 're sorry we did . Jackie is as black as The Raven . He 's on for half the act . After Martinet does some juggling and magic with balls , matches , and watches , he opens the door of an imitation cuckoo clock and out hops the crow . Martinet holds his breath at this point because there 's always the chance that Jackie will fly off and perch on some dowager 's tiara . So far he has n't . Once the routine gets under way , Martinet breathes freely . Jackie assists his master in juggling and by blowing a whistle , holding a lighted cigar in his beak , and catching tiny hoops . It does n't sound like much in print . What gets the audience is Jackie 's personality , and to describe a crow 's personality is beyond us . Martinet and Jackie have been together for sixteen years . The man is fifty-two and has been in vaudeville almost his whole life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the war . In his youth he was an er.luilibrist . " I am the only man in the world who can balance himself upside down on one finger , " he told us . ' We took his word for that , as he does himself , for he has n't performed the feat in twenty , years . Jackie is seventeen and has been in vaudeville practically his whole life . They met in 1922 , when Martinet , who was driving from Kansas City to Chicago on a vaudeville tour , saw some boys knock a hahy crow out of its nest . He stopped and rescued the crow , thinking it would make a nice pet and never suspecting how concretely and handsomely he would he rewarded for his humanity . A few months afterward he dropped a ball he was juggling in his dressing room and Jackie retrieved it . Martinet decided to train his bird and had him acting within a year . " Since then I 've been taking it easy , " Martinet told us cheerfully , and expressed thanks that crows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martinet is as fond of Jackie as if he were his own son , and Jackie likes nothing better in the world than to be combed by Martinet ; he is constantly picking up his comb and putting it in Martinet 's hand . He eats a quarter of a pound of beef , two egg yolks , and a whole pear daily , and would drink , too , if he had the chance . He does n't , because his master remembers an incident of Jackie 's youth . He happened upon a jigger of whiskey , took it neat , and was plastered for two days . Otherwise the life of the two together has been unexciting , aside from one harrowing experience in Champaign , Illinois , ten years ago . Jackie flew out of the stage door and Martinet dashed after him , tears running down the down makeup he always wears . He was so relieved when a small boy miracub lay nabbed Jackie , who was resting on a fence , that he gave the boy fifty dollars , which was within twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries Jackie about in a suitcase with a wire-mesh window , but allows him the freedom of his room , being reconciled to sleeping with the window closed . Jackie steals money , rings , and keys and hides them expertly under carpets . " He 's very intelligent , like all thieves , " said Martinet complacently . Habit A PUZZLED Midwesterner has 1 1 written to us about something that happened the last time he was in New York . He had just dressed for dinner in his hotel and was waiting for an elevator when the door of a nearby room crashed open and two middle-aged ladies hurtled out . " And do n't come back , either ! " a man 's voice shouted after them from within . At this point the elevator arrived and the two ladies got in , followed by our correspondent . The trip down was consumed by small repairs to the ladies ' hair-dos and shoulder straps , but as they reached the but-torn one of them spoke .
