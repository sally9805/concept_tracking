txt Thurman Arnold , head of the Dena ' tment of Justice 's anti-trust division , charged here today that great industries are keeping up prices artificially at a time when other economic indices , are crashing and that factories are I being closed , men thrown out of work , all to the ens mat monuputycontrolled price structures may be maintained , even though lower prices would speed employment . The speech , delivered before the Advertising Federation of America , was listened to with unusual Interest as coining from the man omclally designated to deal with trusts and monopolies , just prior to the launching of President Roosevelt 's $500,000 Investigation of the whole subject . Mr. Arnold will almost . certainly be a member of the proposed 12-man joint commission . Formerly a professor at Yale and author of the satirical " Folklore of Capitalism , " Mr. Arnold discussed the proposed Investigation and pointed out that no major monopoly study has been made since passage of the Clayton Act in 1914 . " We have the right to expect a better defined picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said he was skeptical of blanket amendments of the antitrust laws , looking to the newly-formulated policy ' of pressing criminal and civil prosecutions to the limit of available funds , combined with the weapon of the " consent decree , " accompanied by frequent public statements of policy and discriptions of each separate case , for the guidance of all industry . Mr. Arnold 's speech was not couched belligerently save toward the close where he turned to the present picture of great Industrie . ? as he saw it  --  struggling to maintain artificial charges ? at a time when every economic sign post pointed to lower prices , Like other spokesmen of the New Deal , Mr. Arnold cited the steel industry as a specimen of this , in an industrial group classified as " approaching monopoly control , " " The price of steel for building supplies , " he declared , " is higher by 57 a ton in the midst of the present recession than it was in 1929 . " Partly as a result of these prices the Industry is operating today at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July it may drop below 20 per cent capacity , " The shock of the business recession is not reflected in reducea prices , but pay rolls have declined 55 per cent during the past year . " Turning to aluminum , another product listed in the monopoly class , Mr. Arnold declared it has not declined in yroportion with the combined wholesale Index . Aluminum served as an illustration ; earlier in his address , of the ineffectual use in the past of the civil remedy , without the criminal prosecution . It was like a big man knocking over a little man , he said and then being exonerated with the formula , " I 'm sorry , It was my mistake . " Thus Mr. Arnold said , In 1909 " The Aluminum Company of America eliminated its largest competitor by the terms of a contract . In 1912 ** cr said , by a consent deee , ' I 'm sorry . ' This was a nice gesture  --  but by 1912 the competitor was gone and at the time this speech was released it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the new Cummings-Arnold formula , is being presented with the double-barrelled tht eat of civil and criminal prosecution , and Mr. Arnold warned that the Department would not receive the white flag of guilty industries , unless they showed positive remedies as well as the " I 'm sorry " apology , " The sole test is , " he said , " that they confer Important public benefits related to restoring orderly come petitive markets which go beyond a promise to desist from the practices charged and beyond any results which could be obtained by a conviction . ' " Artificial " Prices Attacked Mr. Arnold has been going tip and down the country making this same declaration before business groups and notifying them of what , In effect , is a revolutionary change in anti-trust policy . What made his speech here today unique , was the reference to the new $500,000 investigation , and his attack on artificial price maintenance . " We are going through a period in which most of our industrial pressures are in the direction of maintaining prices which there is no purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cutting down production and creating unemployment . " He revealed that " conference after conference of businessmen in my office illustrate this tendency , " Sometimes the effort is made " through suggested agreements , " he said , " sometimes through the policies of combinations which dominate the industry . Sometimes the excuse IS labor costs and sometimes it is maintenance of bookkeeping values . The explanations are , no doubt , sincerely made but the result is always the same  --  to keep up prices and slow down employment . " Backs Thorough Inquiry He continued : " Incredible as it may seem , in order to keep prices up industry is choking off its own , avenues of distribution , decreasing employment and widening the disparity of prices . We can not cure that situation through the anti-trust laws alone . By Itself the Sherman Act is a brake , and not a source of motive power . It attacks coercive prac- 1 Bees which eliminate competitors . ' Other instrumentalities must fur-1 ni , , h the small businessman with the credit and other facilities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are removed . But a film anti-trust policy addressed both to Courts and Congress may at least clarify the problem , " There is another immediate need . A more general survey of the monopoly problem than these particular statements can give is also required . No comprehensive study of this character has been undertaken since the passage of the Clayton Act , in 1914 . There has been no examination of the anti-trust law in connection with labor legislation , tax legislation , securities and exchange legislation , credit control , all of which deal with different phases of the same industrial activities . . . . " We must bring these different experiences with the anti-trust law I together in order to treat the probtem as a whole . It is our hope that the Congressional investigation will accomplish this . Out of such an investigation no easy remedy will emerge to which everyone will epee . Yet , we have the right to expect a better defined pictuie of the problem . "                @ @ @ @ @
