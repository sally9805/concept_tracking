txt Mayor La Guardia 's executive tax levy budget ' for 1936 aggregating $545,356,833.11 was presented to the Board of Estimate in City Hall at 6 o'clock last night , with a statement showing that the city 's estimated income next year exceeds the budget by $203,944.43 . The new budget is $8,075,766.79 below the current budget total of $553,432,599.90 . For the last five days the Mayor has devoted himself almost entirely to the task of cutting 1936 departmental estimates , which amounted to $582,294,543.04 . He cut these requests by $36,937 , - 709.93 . This was accomplished although he had to allow increased amounts for certain departments . " We have submitted a balanced budget , and there is no question about that , " said Budget Director Rufus E. . " It was not an easy thing to achieve . The reason for its accomplishment was the intensive concentration on it for the last five days by the greatest little budget director in captivityLand that 's His Honor the Mayor . " Gross Total $613,183,150 . . With his budget the Mayor submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informing the Board of Estimate of some of the underlying principles of the budget . The tax levy budget is considered apart from the city 's gross annual expenditures . Departmental expenditures from other than tax levy funds are estimated at 667,826,317.06 next year , a cut of $1,627,726.37 under the 1935 estimate . The gross total of the 1936 budget is $613,183,150.17 against the gross of $622,886,643.33 for 1935 . The Board of Estimate will begin public hearings on the tax levy budget next Monday at 11 A. M. , having considered the budget in executive session meanwhile . Following those hearings the budget goes to the Board of Aldermen , where it may be reduced , but not increased . Thereafter , it passes into the form of the budget " as proposed for adoption , " and becomes effective upon the votes of both branches of the Municipal Assembly . James J. Lyons , Borough President of the Bronx , thanked the Mayor yesterday for submitting a " real , honest-to-goodness budget that was not a sham . " The Mayor assured him that the budget was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the 1936 total was assembled with an eye on 1937 . Describing budgetmaking as both difficult and delicate , he asked his colleagues " not to work on it with a sledge hammer . " The budget originally carried an item of $20,000,000 to protect loans made by the city 's bankers against arrears of taxes . Mayor La Guardia cut this first by $3,000,000 , explaining that this amount had not been borrowed , and then made another cut of $6,500,000 which the city does not expect to borrow . The tax arrears reserve thus was left at $10,500,000 , apparently with complete acceptance by the bankers . Mayor La Guardia estimated a $5,500,000 saving out of revenues forecast in the 1936 budget and put the reduction in debt-service requirements next year at $10,471 , - 076.38 . These reductions combined brought the budget down to $537,461,523.52 , but the Mayor found he must add " mandatoryand inescapable items . " Mandatory increases for public schools and colleges amounted to $3,370,439.42 , while additions to the reserve of the Teachers Retirement System required $867,044 . The Mayor added almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary because of new hospitals opening next year which would provide 1,200 new beds . Provision is made for the appointment of 600 new policemen in 1936 . The Mayor said the appropriation of $512,646 for this purpose was nominal , as it would mean about $854 for each man during the year . The places must be legalized in the budget before they can be filled , and the method of paying salaries will be worked out later . It was believed that the Police Department would add men at various times during the year , making a full year 's salary for each of the 600 unnecessary . The Mayor found mandatory increases necessary which he did not like , such as the salaries of the five additional justices provided for the Municipal Court by the Legislature . Court increases amounted to $525 , - 685.55 , and the Mayor remarked parenthetically that only two of the five justices actually were necessary . Election costs , including those of the Spring primary , amount to $402,120 . Other increases in appropriations were set at $223,680.82 . Surplus Estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year would show a $3,000,000 surplus . The Mayor said this surplus now was estimated at $5,300,000 . Similarly , the Controller on Sept. 5 estimated 1936 general fund revenues at $96,750,000 . The Mayor said this amount now was estimated at $100,280,000 . Under the bankers ' agreement the real estate tax levy for other than debt service requirements is limited to $270,000,000 . Levies on new properties this year and next year amount to $3,535,000 , while debt service requirements are $166,445 , - 777.54 . The city 's total estimated income thus is $545,560,777.54 , or almost $204,000 above its budget . The tax arrears reserve required by the bankers ' agreement is still a sore point with the Mayor , his message disclosed . He submitted tables showing the increase in payments of taxes and demonstrating that the city has ample security for its loans . He said the reserve should be cut to $6,000,000 in 1936 and 1937 , contending that this was ample to protect the bankers ' loans . Mandatory increases imposed by the Legislature also are irksome to the Mayor . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue to meet the expenditures , adding that no city could exist long unless this were done . Commending Mr. Taylor for his conservative estimates of city income , the Mayor said extravagant estimates might have led the city into unwarranted spending . He declared that " business and industrial conditions were now improving " and looked for enactment of new licensing fee laws by the Board of Aldermen to produce $5,000,000 as a means of spreading the cost of city government over a wider base . Mayor La Guardia forecast a lowered tax rate next year because of the reduced appropriations for debt service . Pointing to a continued improvement in the city 's credit standing , he said it should be used for the benefit of the city " and not for the profit of the money lenders . " Expressing the hope that the city soon might restore the salary cuts imposed on city employee , the Mayor commended them for their part in keeping the budget balanced . He said he knew there were many instances where city employes were overburdened with work , because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher-salary brackets have been brought down to a point of " thorough deflation , " he said . Schools Get Biggest Increase . The Board of Education requested the largest single increase in the budget , but the Mayor said he could grant only $3,011,501.85 of the $7,356,516.22 increase sought . He said the amount granted was more than made necessary by mandatory salary increases ; appointment of permanent teachers to replace substitutes and new teachers required by the opening of additional high Schools , He added that he regretted that he could not grant enough money to permit reduction of the size of high school classes , but said a start on this work could be made in elementary schools . Expansion of child guidance work , and a study of school curricula were desirable , but impossible under present financial conditions , he said . Park appropriations were held down , with an increase of only $141,377.50 over this year 's total . The Mayor said he would be guilty of " official cowardice " if he did not warn the taxpayers that the enlarged park and playground program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children had shown the necessity for parks and playgrounds , the Mayor said , but he invited criticism of the cost while the program still was under way . If Federal funds continue , he said , another hundred new playgrounds would be opened next year . Appropriations for the Parole Commission were dropped from the budget on the ground that it was an agency which overlapped with ) thers . Mayor La Guardia said a careful two-year study had convinced him that the commission could be dropped . Electric power companies came in for criticism in the Mayor 's message , when he said a net reduction pf $477,820 had been made under . he 1935 appropriation for power and light used by the city . Last year , he recalled , $1,250,000 was cut rom these appropriations because " Any one familiar with the cost of electric current knew that . the city liras being overcharged . " If rates could have been reduced to that extent the Mayor said they could have been out twice as much during several periods of the last fifteen years . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the rapacity of the power companies . " In general , the Mayor said , the city was continuing its policy of replacing worn out equipment as rapidly as its financial condition permitted . He said true economy dictated these replacements , to eliminate the cost of repairs to obsolete equipment .
