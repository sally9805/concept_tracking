Unlike the heavyweight boxing championship ( see p. 34 ) , the heavyweight wrestling championship changes hands so rapidly that most of the time no one really knows who has it . Last week in Los Angeles . 25.000 wrestling addicts watched the newest claimant to the title , Dave <P> Levin of Jamaica , N. Y. , defend his dubious right to it against an enraged Mexican named Vincent Lopez , Pacific Coast claim ant . When each had won one fall , Wrestler Lopez charged the referee , had to be restrained by his handlers . Wrestler Levin won the third fall six minutes later . <P> U. S. wrestlers are vaguely divided into regional groups . Each group recognizes as world champion its own champion who , for box-office reasons , usually prefers not to wrestle rival champions . Currently , there are six claimants to the title besides Levin : Rudy Dusek , Danno O'Mahoney , Everett Marshall . Leo Daniel Boone Sav age , Ali Baba , Jack Sherry .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
