A flag of orange , white and dark green-with a spinning wheel rampant on the white-is the banner of the Indian National Congress , the party name of Mahatma Gandhi 's followers . Last year the 3,000,000 enrolled , dues-paying members of the party resolved that they must have a physical nucleus , a permanent Congress City of their own at some place completely away from British-dominated cities . Last week this great constructive dream of a multitude of squabbling politicians came to a physical culmination . <P> The site chosen was in virgin territory , some 200 miles north of Bombay and eleven miles from the nearest railway . It was on the vast estates of fierce-mustached , smoldering-eyed , trembling-lipped Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel , one of mild Saint Gandhi 's wealthiest followers . As might be expected , this great mogul , scion of a rich Bombay family of landed proprietors , is no radical . He insists that " In accordance with ancient Indian tradition we must see that the landlord ever remains the father and guardian of his tenants ! " But although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow party members , he was glad enough to give the land . <P> Ten thousand Indians soon began work on the 3,000-acre Congress City site , many of them volunteers toiling for love of Saint Gandhi &; Mother India . Last November the timetable of the builders was badly upset when the Tapti River unseasonably rose in flood , and failed for six long weeks to subside . During this time it was impossible to ferry across the angry waters the pipe and corrugated iron sheeting needed for the Congress City . The Congressman in charge of the work , Mr. Nanda Lai Bose , a dry goods merchant by profession , went upriver in search of a shallow ford , discovered a bamboo forest , and drastically decided to build most of the City of bamboo . Three thousand villagers were set to chopping the long reeds . Huge rafts of bamboo swept down the flood , were lassoed from the banks as they came opposite the site , and Congress City was soon rising in record time amid the great mogul 's cotton and corn fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gandhi 's politics , and 500 head of cattle were soon creating difficulties among the bamboo stalks , for it is almost impossible for a sincerely pious Hindu to be firm with the cow , a sacred animal . Finally bamboo cages were built in which the cows were gently confined . Meanwhile whips were cracking over bullocks as these nonsacred males helped drag bamboo and build Congress City .
