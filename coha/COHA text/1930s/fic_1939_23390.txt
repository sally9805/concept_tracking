" THEY REQUIRED OF US A SONG " A STORY BY RALPH BATES M Y FRIEND Yea had talked so often and with so much distinction of his village of Beauchamp St. Michael that when he suggested that I might some day be pleased to spend a week at the manor I at once expressed my desire to do so . We went to Beauchamp St. Michael that week-cnd . I t was Yeo 's curiously flavored speech that had awakened my interest ; for his county of Berkshire neighbors my county and from our hilly eminences one may even descry his village . Beauchamp St. Michael was indeed very lovely and very stately . Except for the rooks in the manor park , which made a kind of decanal chant with the parsonage rooks , and the occasional passage of cart wheels over the flinty roads , the village was utterly silent . A great wheat field , at that time freshly furrowed so that the rooks of both colonies flapped over it daylong , stretched away from the manor to the edge of an abrupt chalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Vale of White Horse . Behind the village rose a huge chalk down , faintly violet with a profusion of harebells ; a folly of beeches stood at one end of the hill . The village was almost invisible from the fields . Not even the church tower overtopped the foliage of domy beeches which entirely hid Beauchamp St. Michael , and there were only two lanes and one field path within the village bounds which gave even a partial view of that lovely little building of the eleventh century . The village was completely withdrawn from even the untroubled world that in all that region still resisted the clamor of modernity . During the whole of that week I did not see a newspaper in Beauchamp St. Michael except the very conservative County Herald , whose editor exercised his stately function with a sententious piety that was fortified by a stubborn conviction that the most creditable state of mind is an unalarmed doze . It was impossible to believe that anything had happened , or would happen , in Beauchamp St. Michael . From the very first moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the uncontemporary flavor in my friend 's speech . It could not have been the mere effect of continuous propinquity , because my friend had spent a great part of his childhood and youth away from home . It must have been because of his admiration and affection for his father , and his continual remembrance of him . Squire Mortimer Yeo spoke a pure Addisonian English , which I fear to spoil in the remembrance , in which , if indeed his speech had in it anything that was not of that period , echoes of Dunne occasionally sounded . " You admire the sermons of the metaphysical poet , sir , " I ventured to say upon the third day of knowing him . " Indeed I do , and have profit in them , but I would rather read the disquisitions of good Archbishop Laud , " he replied . He was , I at once discovered , a Laudian High Churchman , and something of an antiquarian in the ceremonies of the Anglican church . In the church of Beauchamp St. Michael the Sarum Use was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that Use was of a most pure and solemn dignity ; so early English , like the lovely carols of the fourteenth century . I still remember the voluminous , deep chasuble of green which the rector wore at Parish Eucharist , so much more priestly than your skimpy fiddle-back chasubles of to-day . Squire Mortimer was not a humorless person , however , though one knew that he was amused by an anecdote only from the twinkle in his eyes and the way he paused and took a pinch of snuff . There was no grotesque exaggeration or forceful epithet in a week of his conversation . Such a method of provoking a smile would have been insufferably vulgar in his library or dining room . Indeed , I do not remember him laughing , or laughing myself , in all that week , yet the Squire 's conversation always amused or interested me . I remember him telling , over our evening glass of perry , of his difficulties with the village blacksmith , " a violent , liquorous fellow , that for all his vaunting of atheism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to remain in the village . When I persuaded the rector to introduce the Sarum Use I ordered Rankin , the blacksmith , to undertake the hanging of the seven sanctuary lamps before the altar . " Rankin is incontinent of speech in whatever place he may be , whether in church or in the public house . Therefore , in order to check Rankin , Miss Cartwright , the rector 's daughter , spent a great deal of time with him in the church . I imagine she must have tried to instruct him in the symbolical significance of church ornaments . You know , undoubtedly , that the seven lamps signify the seven churches of the Vision of St. John the Divine . That evening , when far gone in his cups at the Rose and Crown , Rankin suddenly delivered a brief but heretical disquisition on the devil . His name was not Satan , according to the blacksmith . ' And I know , ' he said , ' for right this very day I have hung up before the Lord God Almighty the seven devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antioch . ' " And as Squire Mortimer 's humor was unforced , his occasions of tragedy  --  and there were such occasions  --  were never made too sharply dolorous . I had asked him whether the bounds of his village extended beyond the escarpment we could see from his gunroom . " Yes , indeed , " he replied . " The bourne at the bottom had always been our frontier against Beauchamp St. Mary since the eleventh century . But latterly , and at some pains , I have changed that . In this village we still observe the custom of beating the bounds once a year . That is , we go round the limits of the village , and at every traditional landmark we beat , or otherwise cause to suffer , a boy . " Squire Mortimer 's voice became graver as he spoke . He paused a while before continuing . " In that way the landmarks are impressed upon the memory of the generation next to ripen . Of course we do not beat our boundary boys severely nowadays ; since the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whose passing I should regret . The bourne , I say , was always our boundary , and we used to jeer at the men of St. Mary every year , across the pond by Old Weir Mill , as we flung in our respective boys . But seven years ago our boy was drowned . Unknown to me , though he had volunteered for the office , he was a weakly lad and the cold water was too much for his heart . There had been a deal of boy 's bullying before he had volunteered , it became known . The following year I bought all of the meadows that lie between two bridges over the bourne , and at the cost of some peremptoriness with my lawyer , secured from the county officers their consent to the alteration of the boundaries . " Of such anecdotes the history of Beauchamp St. Michael was made . The sadness of death and the risibility of life were in that village reduced , it seemed . There was a fine Anglican decorum in everything , and I imagined that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find context there . Two days before I took my departure from the manor my friend and I drove over in the Squire 's dog-cart to the county town . Over lunch at the Yeo Arms Hotel ( named after another branch of the family ) we heard of the persecution of the Jews in Germany , which had broken out that week with fresh violence . Upon our return to the village we told Squire Mortimer of this , and from the way he paused in filling his glass with perry I saw that he was moved . The twitch of his lips and a certain hardness in his gaze , that suddenly disappeared , indicated that for this gentleman , whose family had held Beauchamp St. Michael certainly since Domesday Book and probably since the tenth century , the hatred of Jews , or of any race as a race , was something impossibly vulgar . After dinner he told us the following story . I observed that he was a little inquiet as he began , and suspected he was about to speak of something unkeyed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have seen the empty house which stands at the postbox corner , on the lane which goes from the manor gates to the church avenue . " I had seen it , dark and slightly sinister , standing within a half-circle of beeches , whose leaves had destroyed all the grass about them , as beeches always do . " A London family once came to this village and lived in that house for a little more than a year . It had been unoccupied for many years before the arrival of the Goldsmiths ; for that was their name . " They were greeted with a certain courteous hostility by the village because they were foreigners ; that is to say , they were not natives of either of the two Beauchamps or of the half-barbarian village of Somerford Parva , our neighbor on the eastern side . The village tradesmen called upon them and reported that they were friendly people , a little too friendly , I remember the baker said , as if they wanted very much to be friends . The village children , who stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally left them alone , because they were city children . " There were six people in the Goldsmith family . The eldest was the grandmother , an aged and white-haired lady of very active body and bright laughter who talked incessantly and indeed scared our taciturn children with excess of words . Her son , Mr. Goldsmith , was a quiet gentleman of unhappy appearance , and that was due to his wife 's sickness . Mrs. Goldsmith was about forty years of age and very beautiful . Her face was of a perfect olive shape , with large brown eyes and lips that once , no doubt , had been attractively red , but now were bloodless and tinged with blue . That she was a very sick woman was plain to see . There was a daughter of about twenty years , a lovely creature , and a boy and girl of six or seven years . " They were a quiet family , though unfortunately they brought an automobile into the village . " Squire Mortimer paused awhile and filled our glasses with an apple brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brittany and only once or twice in Massachusetts . I noticed the deliberation with which Squire Mortimer had chosen the un-English word " automobile " instead of " motor car " which the villagers would have used . It exactly expressed his opinion of such vehicles . " Time went by and the Goldsmiths found their place in the village easily enough . Then it began to be whispered that they were Jews . That made no difference to their comfort or to ours , I do not need to tell you . The Goldsmiths were Jews , it was said , and the fact was sufficiently notable to demand expression , but that was all . There is something solemn about the Jews , some-thing intense , so that the thought of Jewry is a little morbid to our villagers . But that is due to the way in which the Old Testament is read in our churches , and to the oppressive manner in which the doctrines of our faith arc expounded . Anglican Christians can not resist the temptation to consider Jews as belonging to a past age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gazed out over the plowed fields to the hedge of wild rose and hawthorn , beyond which glimmered the White Horse Vale . " If the history of our English Church were properly taught , so that we perceived its continuity with the Early Church , our mental gaze would be led back without gaps in our vision to those days , and to that place in which the Jews lived as a people , and we should not find them strange . As it is , the Jews are a people of another place and time , intimate with momentous things , from which we shrink as timorous children do from the solemnities of religion . " Squire Mortimer was seeking to define his own reaction to the Goldsmith family , narrowing his eyes as he spoke , as was his trick when engaged in refining his thought ; but I was astonished to note how precisely his words described my own reactions to the Jewish race . I too was brought up in the Anglican church . " I think I have defined our feeling correctly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hostile existed it never showed itself . " " N tradesman , in speaking to Mr. Goldsmith , might say , ' You like this , ' or you do not like that , ' placing a light emphasis upon the word , thus disclosing that he thought of them as ' you people . ' Mrs. Cartwright called upon the Goldsmiths , but never on Friday evening or Saturday . Mrs. Woodward of the Priory at the other end of the village did not offer to sell them tickets for the County Ball , nor does she offer me tickets , by the way . The rector did not ask them for subscriptions to the Organ Fund . But when the annual effort on behalf of the Cottage Hospital was made the Goldsmiths , without ostentation , gave liberally . They were very much esteemed , they were Jews ; that was the village attitude toward them . Yet nobody was able to say with certainty that the Goldsmiths were Jews . I knew they were of English nationality , though they had recently been living in Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Goldsmith became more gravely ill . The husband made frequent visits to London and upon several occasions a doctor returned with him . A nurse came to stay with the Goldsmiths for a while , and afterward departed . " Then , one Sunday evening , Mrs. Cartwright and her daughter and myself were walking to Evensong from the manor . They had taken tea here . That lane , as you know , runs past the Goldsmith house . I was beginning to frame a remark concerning the occupants when a most terrible scream rang out . I had never heard such a scream , it pierced not only my hearing but my imagination also . In that dark avenue , in the solemnity of evening , and at that corner where the beech trees make a denser gloom , the scream , which sank with exhaustion into a grieving wail , awakened fear in me . " The rector 's daughter wished to return and clutched my arm . We were for going on when again wild shrieks came out of the house , in the voices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paces toward the manor and stood trembling . Again the cries , now of three persons , disturbed the silence . I have never known such a terrible transformation of our village ; the trees , the light , the silence that preceded and followed the cries were all changed ; the place became a land of fear and most bitter woe . ' Please follow me , ' I said to the rector 's wife and opened the gate and hurried up the path . As I did this the little Goldsmith boy ran out of the house in a frenzy of terror and despair . He ran off by the beech trees and flung himself down on the ground and wailed . I saw the rector 's daughter hesitate , and then she jumped over the ditch and hurried through the avenue of trees and bent over him . " / went into the house . The twentyyear-old daughter was screaming . It was her screams that became wails at every period of exhaustion . Mrs. Goldsmith was lying on the floor . The daughter at one moment would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fling up her arms and tear her hair . Her eyes did not see me . She cried , in a language I did not understand , a sentence which Mr. Goldsmith weeks later explained to me . She tore her hair and screamed , " ' Yu hast du gegangen , mama meine ? ' " ' Where have you gone , mother mine ? ' she was wailing . " I thrust her aside and the little girl , and tried to lift the mother , but at the first touch I knew she was dead . Mrs. Cartwright came in , and in the failing light we carried the dead woman to a sofa and covered her with the tablecloth . The girl meanwhile clawed al us and at her mother like a wild creature of the brakes . " Before we left the husband returned . Miss Cartwright stopped him on the path and told him what she had learned from the little boy . He did not hasten but came in slowly and quietly , so that I did not hear the door opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ah , woe is unto me , woe is unto me , ' he whispered and fell upon his knees , beating his forehead . While he was thus mourning the little boy ran back into the house and in his despair began to seize the ornaments of the room and hurl them on the floor . Then he rushed headlong to the sofa and flung himself upon his mother , and all of them once more began terribly to cry their grief . Rachel , the eldest daughter , thrust her head back and with closed eyes cried again and again , 17u bast du gegangen , mama mein ? ' " It was not only that I was shaken by their woe , but I was afraid . I had never witnessed such despair , and all thesecurity and the amenity of this village of Beauchamp St. Michael had vanished . The very external appearances of the trees outside and the slope of the downs seemed to have changed and I was in an alien land wherein the primitive passions of the heart wandered unconfined like terrible beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fear was I that I began to make the sign of the cross and only remembered that I might offend them when I had already half completed the sign . Presently the widower very quietly asked us to leave . " Mrs. Cartwright at first wished me to take her home , but when we had gone but a few paces toward the church and the adjacent rectory she said : ' I think Evensong would steady my nerves . ' " She is a strong-minded woman and was already recovering from that experience . Her daughter chose to go to the rectory . " As we approached the church we heard the choir singing , bravely and loudly . I can not find words to describe my relief , in hearing that plain cheerful music , so characteristic of our Anglican church . Mrs. Cartwright felt the same comfort , I know , as if a breeze had touched her forehead and restored her sanity . We walked in silence through the churchyard gate . Suddenly , in a moment when the choir was silent she said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not unchristian , I hope ; but why do Jews mourn so savagely ? It is horrible , barbaric . . . ' She shuddered and closed her eyes . " ' Come , ' I said , ' let us go into the church . ' The choir began to sing again , and hearing the words , I shivered with the suddenness of a new understanding . Grief , like a rushing mighty wind , swept over me . It was not my grief , but Grief , a force of the hostile universe . I stood there even more shaken than I had been in the house of the dead , aware of the immensity of time past and time to come and the unassuaged sorrows of countless generations of oppressed and exiled men , to whom the scroll of life was ever , and still is , mourning and lamentation and woe . " Mrs. Cartwright pulled herself together and with a rueful smile said : ' I suppose it 's their custom . There , listen , that is my favorite psalm and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered as the choir sang lustily , with no grief , of the sojourn of a ravished people upon the banks of the rivers of Babylon . As for our harps , we hanged them up : upon the trees that arc therein , ' the baker 's voice sang out firmly . And I heard the village carpenter strive to outsing him with Tor they that led us away captive re-quired of us then a song . ' " The sidesman went before me to open the gate of my pew but I stumbled and almost fell as the choir merrily trolled that awful , yes , awful poem . I knelt there while my villagers blithely chanted , and afterward I left the church and came here to the manor and called the rector to me . " For weeks the Goldsmiths ' sorrow endured . In the first week I called at their house and found a son , of whom I had not known , sitting upon the floor , mourning his mother after the prescription of his faith . Then Rachel , the twenty-year-old daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by evening time . When I was told I took my horse , and straightway , impelled by some awakened instinct , rode straight to the pool where our bounds-boy had been drowned . There I found her , crouched against a willowtree , in a stupor of grief repeating in her own language , ' Why have you left us behind , mother mine ? ' " I tied my horse to a fence and lifted her up . She took my arm and I led her back to the village by a lane which avoided her house . We passed the baker in the lane and he stood aside and took off his cap as she passed . There was a group of villagers at the manor gate and these , seeing the girl 's face , also stood aside and were silent . I took her into my library , and left her there . When I returned she was asleep . For days afterward I felt that the library was not my own . " So long as their mourning lasted it seemed that the village was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so later they went away for several weeks , and I confess that we were all relieved . " Afterward when they returned I became better acquainted with them , but despite all my efforts I was never really at ease in their presence . I not only sensed how alien I must be to them , but I was definitely ashamed . At the end of their year of tenancy of the house they took up residence in London . Some years ago I called upon them Rachel , the daughter , was the first to greet me . When I put out my hand she took it and pressed her lips against it . She had become even more beautiful . She reminded me of one of those Madonnas of Botticelli whose faces are filled with a sad presentiment of rejection , painted during that late period of the artist 's life when he was under the sway of Savonarola , thundering from Florence against the terror and iniquity of the Borgia , then misgoverning in Rome .
