At 6 o'clock one evening in Detroit 's Hotel Statler , John L. Lewis shook his bushy head and sat up in bed to take his medicine . His secretary put a spoonful in his mouth . Mr. Lewis swallowed and made a face . He had influenza . Shortly a man left the sickroom . Newshawks in the corridor crowded around him asking , " How are things going ? " The answer was curt : " Things are getting hot . " To newshawks patroling the corridor all evening it seemed that the heating took a long time . <P> Visitors came and went . Midnight came , 1 o'clock , 2 o'clock . The newshawks in the corridor tried to encourage one another by saying that they thought that the voices in the sickroom were not so loud . Someone even thought he heard laughter . Finally the door opened . Out came Michigan 's Governor Frank Murphy , his red hair awry , his face haggard . The Department of Labor 's conciliator , James Francis Dewey , followed , his plump jowls sagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith emerged smiling . Newshawks trooped after them to the elevator , up to the presidential suite on the twelfth floor . Governor Murphy sat down at a desk and faced the press . <P> " An agreement has been reached under the terms of which the Union agrees to end the strike . The signing . . . at 11 a. m . . . . " Before he could finish his statement flashlights were popping , newshawks were rushing out to put the news on the wires . After eight days of almost uninterrupted negotiation in Detroit , the six-week strike , which had paralyzed General Motors and kept 135,000 men out of work , was over . <P> Morning came . The negotiators , except influenzial Mr. Lewis , appeared in the courtroom of Judge George Murphy , brother of the Governor . They waited till the judge concluded a case . Then court attendants arranged seats , floodlights and movie cameras were carried in . Spectators scrambled over the jury box looking for points of vantage . Governor Murphy took his seat between Wyndham Mortimer , vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive Vice President William S. Knudsen . The Governor borrowed a pen from Mr. Mortimer . He and Conciliator Dewey signed , next Mr. Knudsen-still with the Union leader 's pen- then Mr. Mortimer and other officials of the Union and General Motors . There was a hearty round of applause . Mr. Knudsen boomed : " Let us have peace and make automobiles . " <P> Quid Pro Quo ? From coast to coast Labor and Industry perused the text to see whether great General Motors Corp . or the militant C. I. 0 . of Mr. Lewis had taken a licking . <P> The agreement stipulated : 1 ) the Union would call off the strike ; 2 ) General Motors would recognize the Union as collective bargaining agent for its members ; 3 ) both sides would behave peaceably- no coercion , no Union recruiting on company property , no more court action by the company ; 4 ) both sides would begin negotiations this week on the grievances of the Union , and production would be resumed at once .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
