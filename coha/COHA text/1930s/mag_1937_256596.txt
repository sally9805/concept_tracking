Floodlights commonly used in cinema studios may heat up small sets , make actors too uncomfortable to do their best work . Beads of sweat on shapely noses and fine foreheads will ruin takes . Last week a bulky Dutch physicist named Cornells Bol , working at Stanford University , had film producers interested in a tiny , super-powerful lamp which will keep their stars cool while working . <P> Bol 's lamp is a stout , strongly sealed quartz tube less than a quarter-inch in outside diameter , with an inside diameter of .08 to .04 in . It contains neon to start an electric arc , is so full of mercury that when the arc vaporizes the mercury , the pressure rises as high as 300 atmospheres . At the core of the mercury the temperature is 14,000 F. , on the inside wall of the tube 1,800 . The lamp is served by a water cooler in which the water must be hurried along in its jacket to prevent the formation of steam bubbles . The heat given off is negligible , since the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite side from the red end where heat waves predominate . The lamp , however , sheds enough red light for filming . <P> A five-inch lamp , no bigger than a clinical thermometer , gives a maximum of 80,000 candlepower . A lamp of this length requires 8,000 volts ( 1,600 volts for each inch ) but the current is only 1.5 amperes . Physicist Bol believes his little tubes will be useful for lighting airports , cinema projection , treatment of skin diseases . He has leased manufacturing rights to General Electric Co. and Philips Glow Lamp Co. of Holland , declared last week that two motion picture companies had approached him with offers . Cost figures were concealed last week but a Bol intimate said they were " ridiculously low . " <P> Cornells Bol talks wittily in his imperfect English , likes sloppy , comfortable clothes , has a plump wife and five chubby sons for whom he keeps a horse and a ponycart . Born in Holland 52 years ago , he came to the U. S. in 1907 to study at Princeton , Stanford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native land where he worked on the development of sodium vapor lamps in the Philips laboratories and devised a way of sealing chrome steel to glass in X-ray apparatus . Last autumn he again bobbed up at Stanford as a research assistant . " Europe , " he said , " iss no blace to bring up fife children . " Stanford is financing his present work , expects some share in the profits .
