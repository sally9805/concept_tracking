Often have ardent research workers rankled under the interference of trustees , directors , presidents who meddled with their work . It has been necessary for them to smother their rage , remain silent , when they have been restrained from teaching evolution , practicing vivisection , inquiring into sex tendencies , etc . <P> In many a case researchers have been dismissed for daring to touch tabooed material . Last week some 600 of tho land 's leading biochemists , physiologists , pathologists , . pharmacologists gathered in Chicago for the annual convention of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology , took steps to make the world safe for Research . <P> Their action : appointment of a committee to investigate offending institutions , to report at the next annual convention . Such institutions , it was proposed , will be blacklisted ; any professor who accepts a position in one will be dropped from his scientific societies . <P> Routine business of the convention was the reading of 72 ten-minute papers prepared for the occasion . Some points made : <P> Pared Brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had found that two-thirds of a man 's brain could be pared away without damaging intellectual powers .

" Long has the pericardium , a fibroserous , inelastic membrane which surrounds the heart , been a puzzle to physiologists . Its function has been discovered by George Crisler and Edward Jerald Van Liere of the University of West Virginia . The inelastic sac acts as a brake , keeps the heart , the muscular control of which , is not sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breaking . <P> Autointoxication . Dr. Charles Herbert Best , Toronto , co-discoverer of the insulin treatment for diabetes , announced his discovery of a new enzyme , claimed it was operative against histamine ( said to be responsible for autointoxication ) . <P> As the convention drew to a close it was announced that next year 's session would be held in Montreal . Followed a low buzzing sound , then scattered professorial applause , then thunderous cheering . Commented one smiling member : " Such a demonstration is more . . . convincing than a poll on prohibition . "
