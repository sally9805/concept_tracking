txt Important producers of Portland cement are not sanguine that the recent increase in price will have any material effect on their earnings this year . It is their opinion , however , that the advance makes it possible for the lower cost producers to look forward to fair earnings in 1933 with a continuance of the current rate of business . Indications are that demand is firming up and that 1932 will mark the low point of consumption . Contracts are being let by the various states with greater frequency under the Federal Aid Act , while further stimulus to construction is probable as a result of the activities of the Reconstruction Finance Corp . Federal approval is being requested by Oklahoma for a program involving 109 miles of concrete road 20 feet wide , with bridges and culverts , entailing use of 650,000 barrels of cement . Eight contracts on 66 miles of road , requiring 241,500 barrels of cement , have been awarded by Georgia , while Navarro County , Texas , has let one of the largest awards for single track concrete yet made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 9-foot pavement . New York 's concrete road program . including bids to be taken up to ? 41e middle of the current month , torah 190 miles . In meeting conditions of the last several years the larger producers have made great progress in reducing operating expenses and improving efficiency . The result is that they are in a position to profit substantially by any stepping up in consumption . One important manufacturer states that some of the operating economies effected seemed almost impossible a few years ago , citing as an instance that his company is now producing a barrel of cement with 25% less fuel than two years ago . The price advance of early August , the first since 1929. of from 19 cents to 29 cents a barrel in the eastern territory , ( exclusive of metropolitan New York ) and 30 cents a barrel in the diddle West found dealers ' with the greater part I their 1932 requirements already booked with be manufacturers for future delivery at the ower , price . Also , many took advantage of the nterval between the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into effect ? a matter of some five days  --  to build up ; heir stocks . No Immediate Further Advance Seen While the cement industry does not look for any further immediate advance in prices , it believes present quotations are showing increasing signs of greater stability and that the chaotic conditions that existed up to the middle of this year have been remedied . As the result of two years of declining demand and keen competition , marked by price slashing and the granting of secret concessions , the most severe price war in recent ? years developed during the closing months of 1930 . In the first five months of 1931 five price cuts were made , bringing quotations to the lowest point in some 15 years . In New York City cement , packed in paper containers and less all discounts , declined 40 cents a barrel to $1.54 a barrel , while the Chicago quotation dropped by 46 cents to $1.40 a barrel and the Albany price by 50 cents to $1.58 a barrel . It is unlikely that any consideration will be given at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York price in line with the rest of the Eastern territory . In this district competition is still most severe , due primarily to foreign imports . Europe , with its cheap labor , depreciated currencies , and extremely low ocean freight rates ( the product often is carried as ballast ) is able to lay down cement in this port at a price that precludes any profit to the domestic competitor . While small in the aggregate as compared with total American consumption , foreign imports have a demoralizing effect on the coast and immediate adjacent markets . Due to the obstacle of railroad freight rates , this foreign product is restricted to cartage distance of the port of landing with the result that it displaces the domestic output , which is consequently backed up on other markets already well served . Imports Fall Slightly During the first six months of 1932 imports of foreign cement have aggregated ' 200,832 barrels as compared with 292,608 barrels in the corresponding period a year ago . In the tat year 1931 a total of 457.238 barrels were imported . Current indications are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 260.000,000 barrels , during 1932 will make between 70.000. - 000 and 75.000,000 barrels as compared with 124,570,000 barrels last year and the record of 176,298,846 barrels in 1928 , the latter figure representing 72.2% of capacity . Un to the close of July output this year totaled 41.815.000 barrels in contrast with 74,032.000 barrels in the corresponding period of last year . During July the ratio of the country 's production to capacity , according to the U. S. Bureau of Mines of the Department of Commerce , amounted to 33.4'ae while the ratio for the 12 months ended with July totaled A year ago these respective ratios were 62% and 53.85 . Output in July amounted to 7. - 659.000 barrels and shipments ** barrels and stocks at the mills at the end of the months aggregated 22.479,000 barrels . - July 's output was off 44.9% as compared with July . 1031. while shipments and stocks were lower by 40.75 and 13.3 ' ; , respectively . 1932 Operations Unfavorable All of the major cement producers will undoubtedly report deficits as the result of 1932 operations . Universal-Atlas Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . and the largest potential producer in the industry , does not make public its financial reports , but it is likely its loss will be substantial . For the 12 months ended June 30. last , Alpha Portland Cement Co. showed a net loss , after depreciation and depletion. of $1,193,449 , as compared with a net income of 5546,583 , equivalent after preferred dividends , to 57 cents a share on the 711.000 no par shares of common stock outstanding in the preceding 12 months . There are outstanding 20,000 shares of 7 , , preferred shares , par $100 . As of June 30 , last . Alpha had current assets , including $4.902,440 of cash and marketable securities . totaling 87.862.452 , against which were current liabilities of $335,801 . Lehigh 12 Months Loss $484,000 Lehigh Portland Cement Co .. which has an outstanding capitalization of 450.348 shares of common stock , par $50 , and 197,594 shares of 7% cumulative preferred , par $100 , for the 12 months ending with June reported a net loss of S484.020 . This compared with a not profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after preferred dividend requirements , in the 12 months ended June 30. 1931 . With the declaration of the $1.75 quarterly preferred dividend last June . the company stated future action on these shares depended on an improvement in earnings , the latter being possibly only in the 6,000,000 barrels annually . Pennsylvania-Dixie Portland Cement Co. for the 12 months ended June 30 , 1932 , showed a net loss of $1,643,140 after depreciation and depletion . In the preceding year the loss was $115,551 . As of June 30 , Pennsylvania-Dixie 's current assets , including $2.756,989 cash and short-term securities , aggregated $5,446,660 and its current liabilities $409,555 . The company has outstanding 130,988 shares of 7% preferred stock , par $100 , on which dividends have not been paid since September 15. 1929 , and 400 , - 000 shares of no-par common stock . For the six months ended June 30 , last , International Cement Corp . reported a net loss of $759,241 as compared with net income of $1 , - 000,627 , or $1.57 a share , on the outstanding 636,124 shares of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has outstanding $17,995,500 of 5% debentures . At the current rate of business , it is likely the company 's loss for the entire year will approximate $2,000,000 after charge-offs for depreciation and depletion of in excess of $3,000 , - 000 , the latter figure being estimated on the basis of such deductions in previous years . During the height of prosperity of the cement industry , International 's directors adopted a policy of making liberal charges for depreciation and depletion , which practice is being continued despite the recent decline In business and consequent earnings . International at 30% Capacity International during 1932 booked its full proportion of the business available . Currently , its domestic mills , which have an annual capacity of 18,000,000 barrels , are running about 30% of capacity . A license has just been closed with one of the leading cement producers of Australia for the use of International 's lncor process . Last year licenses were granted for the manufacture of Incor for Denmarli , Norway , Sweden and Finland . Also , the company 's Dallas , Texas , plant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities for the making of Incor in five states  --  Pennsylvania , Indiana , Kansas , Texas and Alabama . Incor , a high early strength cement , was developed by International 's chemical engineers previous to 1928 , in which year the company was granted patents in the United States and in all the principal foreign countries of the world . International 's foreign business is on a profitable basis , with the exception of Cuba , where general business conditions have been severely affected . The Cuban plant is running between 15% and 20% of capacity , while the South American plants one each in Argentina and Uruguay  --  are operating at around 65 ' , . Foreign plant capacity of the company is about 6,000,000 barrels annually . $3,000,000 Plant for Brazil Late in December or early in January , International will enter another South American country . In Brazil one of the most modern plants in the world is being erected Fit a cost of about $3,000,000 . The capacity of this plant will be 800,000 barrels annually , aid provision has been made for the doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mill is close to its source of raw material and located conveniently on the Bay of Rio , thereby insuring cheap delivery to its principal market , the city of Rio de Janeiro . This new plant probably will be a good contributor to the company 's revenue next year , as the demand for cement in Brazil is large and growing an in the past has been met mostly by European imports , which pay a high tariff , Recently to meet its cement needs Brazil reduced its cement tariff by ** for 60 days , period which will expire as International 's new plant is brought into operation . Up to the time International entered the field , but one small mill existed there and that was close to the City of Sao Paulo .
