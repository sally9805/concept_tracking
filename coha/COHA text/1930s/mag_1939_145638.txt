Broadway usually runs out of gas around May i , but with the New York World 's Fair coming , the present theatre season is fueled for a non-stop flight straight through the summer . Best evidence that Broadway has its eye on Flushing , Long Island , is the sudden boom in musical shows . Last season there were eight musicals and revues in all . When Stars in Your Eyes ( book by J. P. McEvoy , music by Arthur Schwartz ) and Blackbirds of 1939 ( by Lew Leslie , music by Rube Bloom ) opened last week , for the first time since 1930 , Broadway had ten musicals running at once . <P> Since 1930 , however , the musicomedy set-up has changed : cinema and radio not only helped ruin musicomedy , but permanently lured away from Broadway many a top-notch musicomedian . Cinema and radio between them tied up such talent as Jack Benny , Al Jolson , the Marx Brothers , Fannie Brice , Eddie Cantor , Charles Ruggles , W. C. Fields . And during musicomedy 's lean years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renegade headliners . Out of vaudeville 's grave Olsen &; Johnson , it is true , have leaped to glory in Hellzapoppin ; Teddy Hart plays an amusing second fiddle to Jimmy Savo in The Boys from Syracuse ; Hiram Sherman made a nice side-street reputation in Sing Out the News . But there are no new giants like those before the Flood . <P> In Stars in Your Eyes , however , are two of the old giants , Ethel Merman and Jimmy Durante ; and people who swoon over both of them will probably hail the show as Four Stars in Your Eyes . Ethel Merman , certainly , is fun even for a man with a head cold : in a pinch she could put over the Boy Scout Oath , Joyce Kilmer 's Trees , or Article IV , Section I of the Constitution of the U. S. She has had better songs than those in Stars in Your Eyes , but she has never sung songs better , or more triumphantly given out her whole personality along with her voice . <P> Jimmy Durante is dippy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the 99%-perspiration-and-i %inspiration school of comedy to which Durante belongs will not suddenly , this time , take to rolling in the aisles- particularly as Author McEvoy has played Schnozzle a dirty trick in the way of gags . <P> With its two headliners taking everything fortissimo , and with Hollywood at its loopiest for background , Stars in Your <P> Eyes follows suit as a boisterous , slam-bang show . Except for Tamara Toumanova 's airy ballet numbers , the dancing comes down hard on both feet . The music is brisk . The humor is hearty . The pace is slow . The plot is terrible . Aside from Ethel Merman , Stars in Your Eyes is just a good routine show , nothing to write home about-even from the World 's Fair . <P> The latest edition of Blackbirds-Broadway 's first all-Negro revue of the season-is an upsy-downsy show , its singing and dancing forced to work like hell to make the audience forget its sketches and jokes . With several newcomers to Broadway in the cast , with cheap costuming and cheesy sets , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attractive Lena Home puts something into a couple of songs , but the best singing is choral , in particular a rich-voiced arrangement of Gershwin 's Rhapsody in Blue .
