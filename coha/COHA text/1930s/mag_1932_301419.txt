Never before has the world been so thoroughly grubbed for gold . College-trained engineers zoom across the northlands looking for it . Oldtime prospectors plod the gullies of the Western States . Abandoned shafts have been reopened and assayed . Throughout the world jobless men have taken picks &; pans and made off for the hills . Some of them have struck rich pay dirt . In Australia , Ecuador , the Rand , Chile , the Philippines , Mexico and Venezuela their luck has started minor gold rushes in recent months , mostly abortive . <P> The world 's output of gold has mounted steadily . Figures published last week by American Bureau of Metal Statistics showed that October production was 2,033,000 oz. , an 18,000-oz. gain from September , a 180,000-oz. gain from October 1931 . Canadian production for the first nine months was 2,271,000 oz. against 1,974,000 in the same period of 1931 , 1,497,000 in 1930 . October gold production in the U. S. was 255,000 oz. against 246,000 oz. in September . <P> The production gain has been marked by increasing speculation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly , not from the scattered scratching of prospectors but from the speeding of operations of established companies and their opening of known reserves . Lower commodity costs throughout the world have made all gold mining cheaper . But it has worked to double advantage in Canada where the Government buys mined gold at the U. S. rate of exchange , hence at a handsome premium for miners . Canadian gold mines have paid $18,422,000 in dividends this year , a 50% gain over two years ago . Last week Charles McCrea . Provincial Minister of Mines , said that this year 's gold mining activities in Ontario alone will split $45,000,000 between wages , supplies , taxes &; dividends . Gold shares have soared in Toronto and Montreal . A further whet to speculation was news last week that famed Manhattan Speculator George Forsythe Breen and Sisto &; Co. planned to invest $250,000 new capital in Barry-Hollinger Mines , a hitherto only fairly successful company whose shares sold at 3 last month ; 9 last week . <P> Only a handful of gold stocks is listed the New York Stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard ( " Sell ' em Ben " ) Smith is so fond that he named his horse for it . In the past eight weeks it has thrashed forward from $11 a share to $15 . Homestake , one of North America 's biggest mines and a bulwark of the Hearst fortune , has flared from $120 to $163 . Jules Semon Bache 's Dome Mines have gone from $11 to $13 . Much speculation in McIntyre Porcupine a Canadian producer , has picked it from $16.50 to over $20 . Last week Toronto 's Financial Post warned : " If investors will keep in mind . . . the fact that 17 years is required for a shareholder in a mining company whose stock gives a 10% yield to obtain a return of his investment , and at the same time get 6% interest , a sounder foundation is laid for calculating the return necessary from investments in all such wasting assets as gold mines .
