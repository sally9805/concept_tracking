txt The Consolidated Gas system has offered to the city and the Federal Government a reduction in the rates it charges them for electricity , a cut so substantial that the government is leaning toward acceptance of the proposal , it was disclosed yesterday . The reduction is understood to run as high as 40 per cent for some types of service , and averages 25 per cent . On the Federal bill of $500,000 or more a year this would mean a saving of possibly $150,000 and on the city 's bill a saving of about $2,500,000 . Mayor La Guardia was reported to be perturbed over the tactics used by the utility company to stave off municipal competition in New York City . He regards the new offer as part of this strategy . Early Agreement Likely . Despite the Mayor 's antagonism , it was indicated that the city and the companies might sign a formal agreement within the next two days , possibly tomorrow morning , embodying the new rates for current for this year , and that the Mayor would then try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modification of his original program . The offer , the latest of several made by the companies in the Consolidated system , embodies by far the greatest concessibns . It no longer contains the understanding , implied or stated , that the city and the Federal Government should discontinue plans for their own plants . City spokesmen pointed out , however , that if rates are cut enough , public operation will no longer be profitable , and the opponents of the yardstick theory of rate regulation will have been strengthened in their fight against a chain of city power plants . The Mayor 's objection to the ratecut plan is that , while it would reduce the city 's own bills , it would not aid the general consumer . Morgenthau Gets Plan . The companies ' proposal was forwarded to Washington about two weeks ago by Rear Admiral Reuben E. Bakenhus , public works officer for this district , with recommendations . Admiral Bakenhus refused last night to reveal what his recommendations had been , but it was reported that he had advised acceptance . In Washington it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Morgenthau , but that no decision had been made . Confirmation that an agreement between the three parties was near came yesterday in a speech by Maurice P. Davidson , Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , before the Brooklyn Kiwanis Club at the Towers Hotel . Mr. Davidson , announcing that a new rate reduction offer had been received , differed with the Mayor by hailing it as a great victory for the city . He indicated that the rate cut might run between 30 and 40 per cent for the city , adding that he was not at liberty to divulge tho exact amount . " A Business Proposition . " The commissioner said with elation that the city had definitely won its fight with the utilities over electrical rates for streets and municipally owned buildings . The conflict over rates , he said , had been caused by " big business , " not the , city government , and the city had defended its own interests in the most effective way possible , " without politics , but purely as a business proposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 12 per cent reduction of Federal bills , but this was rejected . It was increased ' to 30 per cent , and again rejected . The commissioner indicated that the latest cut to the government might be as high as 35 per cent . As commissioner , Mr. Davidson said , he had merely " asked a few questions " of the utilities about the $10,000,000 the city was paying for electric light and power each year . The companies were reluctant , he said , to disclose the basis of their rates , whereupon the city made its own cost analysis and found it was paying 37 per cent more for street lighting and 60 per cent more for other facilities than the average in other municipalities . As a result , he said , the city demanded a rate reduction . The city could not understand , Mr. Davidson said , why it should pay 5.7 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity for street lighting when it cost the companies only 1.8 cents to carry that amount of current to the foot of the lamp post . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 per cent reduction in electric light rates , because he felt that such a reduction would have a salutary effect on general rates for the entire city , " Brought right on Themselves . " " But when bidding time came , " he continued , " the utilities failed to see the signs of the times . They did . not notice that the Federal Government was sponsoring some gigantic power projects . They seemed to have forgotten that the Legislature had given the city the authority , subject to popular referendum , to make its own power . " Instead the companies handed the city a bill for 1935 $700,000 higher than the previous year . In other words , they were planning to collect from the city in payments almost the exact amount the city expected to raise by the municipal tax on utilities . We did not know whether to admire them or get angry with them for their effrontery . But that is how the utilities brought this fight on themselves . " A reduction in rates to the city will inevitably lead to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a more widespread use of electricity , and , if the companies can only see it , greater profits to the utilities . " The steps taken so far have been to the great credit of the city . They mean that the city is no longer at the mercy of the tyranny of the utilities . We feel we are on the right track . If the city gets a square deal it will cooperate . If we do n't get a square deal , we will keep up the fight . " The companies have been trying , in the opinion of the city administration , to negotiate an agreement with the Federal Government first , and thus weaken the city 's position with regard to municipal plants . The city is dependent on the Federal Government for loans in order to finance the plants here . It was regarded as likely that the Federal Government has been withholding acceptance of the offer until the city determines the stand it is going to take .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
