txt Edsel Ford . President of the Ford Motor company . told the Temporary National Economic Committee today that . Ford patent policies encourage eompet it ion . Opening the first specific part of its investigation today with Mr. Ford on the witness stand , the Committee showed how the automobile industry 's " patent pool " or cross-license . system keeps the channels of competitive industry free from he dykes and barriers of patent , monopolies . ' Obviously with the object of dramatizing the patent situation by the personality of one of America 's foremost producers . Eckel Ford was led by questioners through the story of how his father " broke " the famous Selden Patent that liberated the automobile industry . M contrasted with the freedom of this industry from patent restrictions , the 12-man Committee tinder Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney ( D ) of Wyoming . Chairman , will in a day or so explore the opposite situation in other industries , where It is charged patents are used to create monopolies , throttle production , increase prices ' and reduce vital mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized by Thurman Arnold , head of the Antitrust Division , in a formal statement preceding Mr. Ford 's testimony . Just a Fly-by-Night Edsel Ford 's testimony at one point brought a shout of laughter from the big crowd as he told how his famous father in 1903 approached the National Automobile Manufacturers ' Association to inquire about joining , and was repulsed with the implication that he was just a fly-by-night operator . This was the year that started both the Ford Motor Company and the famous Selden Patent , and loosed a chain of events that led to the present freedom of the industry from cramping patent restrictions , as described by Mr. Ford on the witness stand . A man named Selden took out a comprehensive patent in 1903 on the idea of a self-propelled motor vehicle , and the other manufacturers agreed to abide by it , and formed a close , corporation with royalties amounting to $15 a car . Henry Ford approached the combination to investigate the situation . " Somebody told him that he ought first to go out and sell some cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a reputation , they said , to prove he was n't a fly-by-night producer , before he applied : . All Ford Patents Free ? " They were n't sure your father was the proper kind of a man to make motor cars ? " asked Hugh Cox , special assistant to the Attorney-General who was directing the questions . " So I understand , " said Edsel dryly while the committee and spectators laughed . The Ford Company I single-handed finally " broke " the Selden patent after eight years , in ' 1911 , and freed the industry for its present system of intensive inventive competition . It is this phase in which the committee expressed deep interest . Questions to Mr. Ford and Joseph I. J. Farley , Ford patent attorney , who accompanied him to the stand , were friendly and encouraging . Mr. Ford testified that his company did not pay or charge royalties for the use of patents , and did not sue on infringements . An example of a device used by all the industry and developed by Ford engineering was the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you collect royalties on that ? " " No , we collected none , " Mr. Ford said . " How many times have you been sued for patents ? " " Sixty times . We have been threatened with suits 346 times . That is since 1926 . There are 13 suits pending . " " Have you lost any of these suits ? " " We have only lost one . " ' Mr. Ford said he believed " patents should be worked "  --  and not tied up on paper . For this reason the Ford Company maintains a policy of encouraging inventors either to join the Ford engineering force , or to set up as manufacturing producers , " You 're also encouraging compe- tit ion in that way ? " suggested Thurman Arnold , intervening from the Committee table . " I believe so . " " And I take it you do n't desire exclusive control ? " repeated Mr. Arnold . " We have no such desire . " There was the obvious desire of Justice Department officials , who are presenting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry manages patent cross-licensing in order to draw a stronger contrast with other industries . More than 40 officials of the glass industry have been summoned to appear immediately after the expected three-day inquiry into the automobile patent situation is concluded , Mr. Ford said his company granted patent licenses to " anyone who wants to use them . " He , said the company once collected royalties on a patent in 1911 , and started one patent infringement suit in 1907 but only as a weapon in the Selden patent fight , directed at an aggressive competitor . Since then it has not . been involved in such action . " 1 take it . " Mr. Cox said . " your company is not interested in making money through an aggressive patent li cation policy ? " - That 's correct . " No Use for Restrictions Answering a question of Senator William H. King ( ID of Utah , Mr. Ford said his company refused to use patents volunteered by inventors when restrictions were placed ' on their use . It is against such restrictions that the Justicd Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pictures case , in connection with which Mr. Justice Black issued a strong dissent , last month . Ford employees work on inventions , wPIleF.S said , develop them on company time , and assign them to the Ford Company without additional compensation . - We feel they should be well paid . and they are . " he said . - IS the purpose of your engineering departments to get patents ? " asked Mr. Cox , No ? it is to develop the art of manufacturing motor cars . " Mr. Farley , who alternated with Mr. Ford , said lack of any patent protection would be " quite a detriment " to small inventors and that capital might be deterred from investing in struggling companies which depend on their invention to build business . Answering a question of Senator William IT Borah ( RA of Idaho , Mr. Fancy criticized present patent law Inc permitting inventors to amend patents without commercial utility so as to apply to practical devices sv : . : rh were developed later on hidereridently by the industry . Mr. Cox developed that the present cross-licensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which each company has access to inventions of ? other companies . " In other words , " said Mr. Cox finally , - you believe development and distribution of a device for genets ! use encourages progress both of public and industry , as contrasted to aggressive patent litigation ? " That is tit ex/ctly , " responded Mr. Ford . its showed no uneasiness as he setlied his slight figure in the witness chair amidst a barrage of fl ? sidights . Ile has appeared several times before Senate hearings , most lecently befOre the Wheeler Railroad committee . His profile grows increasingly like that of his father , but in build he is a good foot shorter than the latter 's tall , lean figure . Arnold Outlines Course Thurman Arnold , head of the Antitrust Division of the Dephrlment of Justice ' , told the Committee that exi , itng paten ? . law " affords to the parent owner such a wick choice in exploiting a new industrial art , that it till %vide opportunities for the 1 ? 1ralnt of trade . " Opportuuit/es for restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - are facilitated by the technical complexity of patent IA 'S ' , the costs of litigation , and the ever-present problem of drawing- a ** ! me between the legitimate is a of patents and the uneconomic extensions of that privilege . " Nils Arnold linked the specific problem With the generalizations and posialates which have gone before . Recalling the teStitnnny of earlier v , iteess , ses Mr , Arnold declared that to mIstain America 's prosperity , compdttitivc , channels must he kept meter and prices must be brought wi ? iiin the range of the moss o ; or national economy tailspins " n a rieprre , sinn. lint the patent law today , he charged , offers a bar- Mr. Arnold then outlined the procedure he would folloW before the Committee , and said the patent situation had been chosen to examine first because of its effect on competitive trade . A patent , he said , is " a legal monopolytranted on the theory that it will promote the progress of science and useful arts . " This was the goal of 150 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether the legal monopolies established by the patent system have proved effective as a means of accomplishing the stated objective ? Other questions were : Have these protected monopolies served to implement and sanction business policies which tend to inhibit scientific progress ? Have these protected patent monopolies , established solely to serve one fundamental objective , been so utilized as to circumvent the fundamental objective of another governmental policy  --  that policy which finds expression in the Antitrust Laws ? Leon Henderson , Executive Secretary of the Committee , on Saturday , declared the growth of American economic activity had been halted but found potentialities of a new upsurge . To end unemployment , he said , the country would have to reach tip in the Federal Reserve index . of production , or 21 points above the 1929 peak . Reviews Lines of study Mr. Henderson summed up the testimony of his two predecessors  --  Isador Lubin , chief of the bureau of labor statistics , and Willard Thorp , Dun and Bradstreet , economist anti advisor to the Department of Commerce , Out of their discussions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own observations on its operation during the depression , he drew the main lines of the Committee 's detailed ' study of the national economy , which began with the automobile patent inquiry . The indicated lines of study covered 13 points , Mr. Henderson said . These are : 1 . Concentration of control of economic power and wealth . 2 . The price system and price policies . 3 . The effect of governmental policies on economic activity . 4 . Desirability of the creation of a bureau of industrial economics proposed to stabilize production . 5 .
