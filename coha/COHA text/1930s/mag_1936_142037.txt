Beaufort is a peaceful town of some 3,000 population on the jagged North Carolina coast . Last year its serious unemployment was relieved by WPA with allotments of funds for a sewing project , building repair projects and a community centre with an auditorium , golf course and tennis court . Biggest problem of Beaufort civic leaders who met last week was to find a project for which WPA funds could be obtained in 1937 . After gravely considering their problem they announced that they had agreed on this boondoggle : a bombproof , gas-proof subterranean chamber that will serve as a haven for the entire population if and when an enemy air fleet comes overhead intent on wiping Beaufort off the map .
