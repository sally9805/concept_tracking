wing as part of the larger coordination of economic processes . Most of this material is familiar in outline to those who have kept in touch with Soviet affairs ; Mr. Freeman , however , has filled in the outline with a vast amount of factual detail , and his volume is a genuine contribution to our knowledge of Russia 's drive toward socialism . The worker has undoubtedly made decisive social and Cultural gains since the Revolution . Through the trade unions , the Communist party and the local , federal and national governing bodies , he can make his voice heard in the formation of policies and programs . For the first time , furthermore , the doors of education and culture have been opened to him . His position has improved economically , and the rate of this improvement should increase when the base for industrialization has been securely laid . If we take two familiar measures of economic well-being , real - wages and hours of labor , this improvement , relative to 1913 , may be clearly seen . Mr. Freeman claims that real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance , low and free rent and the like , were 69 percent above the pre-war average in 1929 and , at the end of 1931 , were estimated at double the pre-war figure . Even if , as Professor Calvin 13 . Hoover thinks , Soviet statistics of real wages are too high , there has been a notable advance . The Soviet work day is the shortest in the world ; the average working day of all Russian factory and mine workers was 9.87 hours in 1913 and 7.02 hours in 1931 . In addition , the Soviet worker is protected at every point in relation to his job by a comprehensive national labor code , enforced by the trade unions and the courts . Mr. Freeman does not attempt to glide over the many problems faced by Soviet economy . He emphasizes , in Particular , the problems of , low labor productivity and high labor turnover , the lack of capital equipment , and the inadequate and inefficient systems of distribution . The realism and creativeness of Soviet technique are illustrated by the shifts and turns which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticisms which can be made of the book . In carrying out the policy of increased incentives ; " wrtes Mr. Freeman , " a general increase in wages by 3o percent was instituted on October 1 , 1931 . " Now this is a tremendous increase for any national economy , socialist or e.apitalist , to make at one time . I should like to know how it was done . but Mr. Freeman does not say . This illustrates a certain trustfulness in the handling of statistical data which I suspect is not altogether warranted . n his discussion of the trade unions , Mr. Freeman writes that their first function is to enforce labor discipline and , In general , to work for economic expansion . This is cer-tainly a legitimate function in a socialized economy . Their second function , he says , is " to defend the workers ' interests against possible bureaucratic misconstruction of policies .

These things aside , Mr. Freeman has presented an r essive record of the advances which have been made by the workers since the Revolution , and of the part they ; ? , 1,41 ' . in the building of a new civilization .

It is providing a huge laboratory for economic and social experimentation . Its example should give force to the demand of workers ' movements for wider measures of social control of economic processes , a demand in evidence even in the United States . I do not mean , for example , that in this country we shall duplicate the Russian pattern . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to ignore what is going on in the Soviet Union , and that in the fight for an economic system in harmony with the needs of the workers Russia will have much to teach .
