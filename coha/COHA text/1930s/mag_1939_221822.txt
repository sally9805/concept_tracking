Last week the municipality of Vienna seized the estate , the royalty rights , the personal relics of one of its most cherished citizens , Johann Strauss , the " Waltz King . " The city 's action seemed to be what the composer would have wished . When he died in 1899 he left his royalties to his Jewish widow ; everything else to the Vienna Friends of Music Association . The widow , growing rich on royalties , bought up all the Straussiana she could , declaring she would leave it to the city . Instead , she left everything to her daughter by a previous husband , also named Strauss . <P> The best Straussiana-the original sheet music of his waltzes-Vienna did not get . For years a rich Viennese railroad man , Paul Lowenberg , collected scores not only of Johann Strauss but of other 19th-Century waltz-men-Strauss 's father Johann , his father 's teacher and rival Joseph Lanner , his brothers Joseph and Eduard Strauss . Collector Lowenberg acquired 1,644 pieces of music . His family , on their uppers just after Anschluss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the U. S. Library of Congress . According to Dr. Karol Liszniewski , Cincinnati musician who arranged the deal , the Library paid Lowenberg 's widow $700 , a fraction of the collection 's worth . <P> Last Sunday U. S. radio listeners heard some of the music from the Library 's stacks . Howard Barlow led Columbia Broadcasting Symphony through ten waltzes , polkas , quadrilles , marches of Johann Strauss and his contemporaries . The titles of the pieces told much of Vienna 's ballroom life-Electrophor polka and Motoren waltzes , written for dances of technical students ; Aesculap polka and Paroxysmen waltzes , for young medicos . A quadrille on English themes contained the tune of Just Before the Battle , Mother . The pieces , some performed for the first time in the U. S. , did not call for waltzing in the streets , but they suggested that the Library of Congress had invested $700 wisely .
