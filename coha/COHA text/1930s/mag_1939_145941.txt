A caution to U. S. parents , but a joy to radio merchandising , is the dread truth that little pitchers have big ears . Daily into these ears the radio pours its ride-'em-cowboy adventure and hearty-uncle promise of dandy premiums in return for mailed-in cereal box tops , bread labels , candy wrappers . Hapless parents , besides footing the bills , have a job on their hands in getting their supercharged , excited youngsters to bed . Result is that children 's programs come in for persistent beefing , not only by U. S. parents but by the more-feared Federal Communications Commission . <P> Last week NBC circulated a production guide designed to take the nightmare out of radio 's bedtime stories , and iron out radio practices in general . Excerpts : <P> Children 's hour stories " must reflect respect for law and order , adult authority , good morals and clean living . " Cowardice , malice , deceit , selfishness and disrespect for law must , be avoided , and so must torture , horror ( present or impending ) , superstition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much gunplay , death rattles . <P> Advice " to be sure to tell mother " or " ask mother to buy " must be limited to twice in one program . <P> Not acceptable are " contests and offers which encourage children to enter strange places and to converse with strangers in an effort to collect numbers of box tops or wrappers , " or phony appeals such as : " By sending in a box top , you will help Widow Jones pay off the mortgage .
