STATES &; CITIES <P> Birth and breeding made Paul Vories McNutt an autocrat , the Democratic voters of Indiana made him Governor and , last fortnight , the State Legislature made him a 50% dictator . To this tall , handsome young man with his shock of white hair and his bristling black eyebrows went a grant of executive power over Indiana unmatched in its history .

He is free to juggle salaries up &; down to suit his own judgment , thereby effecting an estimated saving of $2,000,000 . Only the Legislature , with its power to tax and spend , and the courts , with their power to review and void , stood last week between Governor McNutt and dictatorship . <P> Fresh from Harvard Law School in 1916 Paul McNutt became an assistant professor and later the youngest dean on record at the Law School of Indiana University .

Last year Republican mudslingers prepared to fling the following heckle at Democrat McNutt : <P> A lawyer who never tried a case ; <P> A soldier who never fired a gun . <P> But when the Indiana G. O. P. also nominated a legionary-lawyer for governor , the heckle was left on the shelf .
