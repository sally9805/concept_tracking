THE POLITICOS-Matthew Josephson- Harcourt , Brace ( $4.50 ) . <P> When they drew up the Constitution , the Founding Fathers carefully designated the various government offices . But they neglected to say how men were to be chosen for them . Madison believed that many political parties would spring up , that safety for the Republic would lie in their cancellations and compromises . Instead , the two-party system became more strongly entrenched in the U. S. than anywhere else . From James Bryce to Charles A. Beard historians have puzzled over this phenomenon , asking almost as many questions as they have answered . How did it happen , for example , that the parties in the U. S. , unlike those of the European democracies , were not identified with a particular section or class ? How was it possible , Bryce wanted to know , for two great nationwide organizations to fight as bitterly as did the Republicans &; Democrats over the Hayes-Tilden election , without plunging the country into civil war ? <P> Last week , with The Politicos , Matthew Josephson joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 760-page volume that attempted a dual task : 1 ) to trace the careers of the Democratic and Republican parties through the four decades after the Civil War ; 2 ) to draw a composite portrait of the professional politicians , party leaders , spoilsmen , local bosses . <P> More successful in the second half of this job , Author Josephson has dusted off dozens of half-forgotten heroes : fast-thinking James G. Elaine of Maine ; sardonic Roscoe Conkling ; crippled Oliver Morton of Indiana , who ran his organization " as the country schoolmaster ran his school " ; portly Zachariah Chandler of Detroit , who wanted to " raise a wall of fire " between the U. S. and Great Britain , and who advised Republican wives not to sleep with Democratic husbands . <P> In his left-wing study of early U. S. capitalists , The Robber Barons ( 1934 ) , Josephson wrote of men who " spoke little and did much " - Jay Gould , Jim Fisk , Collis Huntington , Morgan , Rockefeller . In The Politicos he writes of men who did as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period after the Civil War saw the flowering of the spellbinders , the men who , when trapped in some snide deal , escaped by waving the bloody shirt , denouncing Jeff Davis , pulling out all the stops in tearful eulogies to the Union dead . <P> The torrent of talk began with the two months of " masterful turbulence " that accompanied the attempt to impeach Johnson . When the Democrats gained power after the towering scandals of the Grant administration , Elaine baited Southern Democrats so skillfully that he soon had them roaring Confederate defiance , effectively distracting Northern attention from the Whiskey Ring .
