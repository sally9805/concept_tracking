txt Position of the British Left Leading Member of Opposition Explains Stand Against Hitler Movement To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : So many of my American friends have written to ask me why those of us on the Left in British politics have no hesitation in believing that the war against Hitlerism must be prosecuted to a viotorious conclusion that I should like to explain the grounds of our attitude . We do not abate one jot or tittle of our criticism of Mr. Chamberlain 's policy nor , indeed , of the pol:cy of his predecessors since 1931 . We believe that " appeasement , " whether of Japan or Italy or Germany , has merely whetted the appetites of the dictators and encouraged them to gamble on the threat of war as a means of securing their ends . We believe further that Mr. Chamberlain 's policy in relation to the Soviet Union was largely responsible for that power 's disastrous decision to conclude a pact with Hitlerism ; for there is no doubt in our minds that the timing of the German-Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war , they could hope for a second Munich and , with it , an immense extension of power and prestige . In our judgment , it is impossible to deny that Mr. Chamberlain and his colleagues have , partly through weakness , done much to encourage Hitlerism in its evil career . A heavy responsibility rests upon them . Hitler 's Methods Decried But Mr. Chamberlain 's record of " appeasement " is evidence that he has no will to war . The occasion for it was Herr Hitler 's ' deliberate choice . The methods he used followed the pattern that has long been typical of him . The difference is that , at long last , Mr. Chamberlain discovered that Herr Hitler was incapable of good faith , had no regard for the sanctity of treaties and set no limits to his lust for a power he invariably exercised with brutal ferocity . Even Mr. Chamberlain was finally driven to admit that any creative life in Europe was impossible if every few months a new surrender was to be made the basis , under threat of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sympathy for British imperialism ; and we do not propose to become its instruments . We have none of Mr. Chamberlain 's faith in the constructive possibilities of capitalism , British or any other ; and we shall seek its transformation at the earliest possible opportunity because we are completely convinced that only in democratic socialism can the road to a lasting peace in Europe he found . But we are not less certain that our principles have no prospect of life before them if Hitlerism triumphs . It would mean the end of our socialism , of our trade union movement , of that great cooperative movement built by the workers ' toil of one hundred years . Whatever the defects of our British system , the common man there is ( as he is not in Hitlerite Germany ) an end as well as a means . Alternative Non-Existent Our tolerance of opinion , political and religious , is wide ; our faith in constitutionalism and democracy is still a living thing ( as it is not , once more , in Hitlerite Germany ) , which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opposed to us is a system that has annihilated these principles and these habits . It governs , avowedly , by the jackboot and the concentration camp . It uses the instrument of war quite deliberately and brutally to expand its power . If it were to be victorious , there would end for us , as Socialists , all that makes life worth living , as it has ended for our German comrades since 1933 . We therefore conceive that we have no alternative but to aid in the task of its destruction . Only then are the conditions present in which , both nationally and internationally , we can go forward to our own goal . We therefore , fully and without hesitation , share the view taken by the British Government that Hitlerism must be destroyed . We do so with no bitterness against the German people ; we recognize that they , hardly less than we , are the victims of their rulers . We know the dangers to any movement which accepts the challenge to conflict ; how could we not know them who experienced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with emphasis that there is no room in the world for our principles and those of Hitlerism . The destruction of the one is the necessary prelude to the victory of the other . Equality in Peace Talks I must add that our aims are clear . Peace for us is both possible and necessary at the moment there is a German Government with which rational negotiations can he undertaken . We shall insist on a peace negotiated freely and between equals . We shall fight against either annexations or punitive indemnities . We shall use all our power  --  and the power to the British Labor movement is no negligible thing  --  to prevent any effort to repeat the errors , especially in method , of Versailles . We shall hope to make the conclusion of hostilities the basis upon which , through the abrogation of the evil principle of State sovereignty , we can reorganize the life of Europe politically and economically . We are determined that the use of war as an instrument of national policy shall be banished from men 's lives . At any point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose or in method , we shall criticize it and fight it . That is why we refused Mr. Chamberlain 's invitation to enter the National Government . We are the Opposition , whose support of this war is at every point conditioned by the coincidences of its purposes with our own . We support it so far because our purposes can not exist in the world in which Hitlerism continues to exist . We do not need to prove that we hate war . We do not need to prove that we have no faith in the power of capitalist society to save the interests of the common people . We deny with emphasis the validity of imperialism , British or other . But we know that to have submitted to Hitlerism would have been to acquiesce in the imposition of a naked and brutal tyranny fatal , in its next phase , to those decent habits of civilization it has taken our movement long years to establish . To have refused the challenge this time would have been merely to postpone the date at which we should ourselves have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no compensation to a people for a loss of its freedom . That has been shown us by Hitlerism in the fate of countless German comrades of ours . It has been shown us , too , in Austria. ? Czecho-Slovakia and Spain . We are fighting for something more profound than the fate of Poland . We are fighting for the right of the human spirit , freely and in terms of reason , to work out its own destiny . In our view , that right can not be won while Hitlerism remains . We do not say that its destruction assures us of the triumph of our principles ; we do say that our principles can not hope for triumph until Hitlerism has been overthrown . Our movement would be untrue to its own highest traditions if it did not take the risks involved in building the conditions out of which that triumph becomes capable of realization . HAROLD J. Lssar , London , Sept. 20 , 1939 . Youth in Crime Records City Percentage Has Declined hut That for Nation Is Still Large To THE EDITOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age analysis of criminals in New York City 's courts during 1938 , appearing in THE NEW YORK Times recently , it is interesting to compare his local statistics with the 1938 national figures released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its Uniform Crime Reports bulletin of January , 1939 . As will be noted from the compilation presented below , 31.7 per cent of criminals in New York City courts were under 30 , while 53 per cent ( excluding those violating Federal laws ) in courts throughout the country were under that age . National crime statistics show the greatest concentration of arrests bee tween the ages of 21 and 29 ; New York City crime statistics show the greatest concentration between 30 and 39 . The following figures show the percentage and distribution of arrests by age groups for all offenses during 1938 : Age Groups . New York City National Under 21 7.9 18.8 2 ( - 29 23.8 34.2 30-39 28.5 24.9 40-49 23.4 13.7 50 and over 16.4 8.4 In the July issue of Uniform Crime Reports , Director J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were more arrests for age 19 than for any other single age group . R  --  ona the middle of 1935 through 1938 ages 21 , 22 and 23 were most frequently represented . However , during the first six months of 1939 once again age 19 predominated in the number of arrests . " Thus while we may pride ourselves in clearing the youth of the community from too great a taint of crime , the fact remains that youth still stands convicted as causing the . greatest number of criminal depredations in the United States as a whole . LOUIS MORGENBESSER . New York . Sept. 29 , 1939 . Registration of Foreign-Born Urged To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your issue of Sept , 29 , under " Kelly . Legion Head , Opposes War Entry , " the American Legion called for law to require the registration and fingerprinting of all aliens in the country . In my opinion , this is not going far enough . It would he wiser to require registration and fingerprinting of all citizens of foreign birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the guise of American citizenship there may be many whose allegiance we may doubt . Some may be spies with sinister motives to destroy our munition plants , ships , water supply . We must take every precaution . ALVI N WORTHAM . New York , Sept. 30 , 1939 . Trees in the City To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a lover of natural beauty I thank THE NEW YORK TIMES for the article on the encouragement to real estate owners , by the Park Department , to plant trees along their property . Traveling through small villages one is awed by the dignity trees lend to their , surroundings . Trees , particularly in large cities , where mother nature seems thousands of miles away , help to bring her closer to us . I am sure that there is not a street in New York that would not he lovelier for the added beauty of trees . JEANNE GEORGETTE . New York , Oct. 1 , 1939.                @ @ @ @ @
