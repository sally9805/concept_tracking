The last form of criticism permitted to survive in Germany was artistic criticism . This was officially abolished last week by a decree of Minister for Propaganda &; Public Enlightenment Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels who thus firmly shackled the sublime to the ridiculous : <P> " To demonstrate the unhalting victory march of our cultural life , I have by decree forbidden all criticism and replaced it with art observation or art description . " <P> Before being permitted to observe German art professionally and describe it in print , former art critics must now obtain a license from Dr. Goebbels . His decree was issued partly because the crushingly-propagandized German cinema industry is now playing to nearly empty houses while Germans crowd to see the few U. S. films admitted to their Fatherland . This state of affairs Dr. Goebbels chooses to blame on his country 's cinema critics .
