Last week that inexorably active American , Martin Dies of Texas , and his House Committee on Un-American Activities resumed their studies in Washington after a two-month hiatus . Up as their first witness was big , loud German-American Bundsfhrer Fritz Kuhn . Mr. Dies &; colleagues elicited remarkably little information on the origins , objects and technique of the Bund , let Fritz Kuhn show to better advantage than he might have expected . <P> The next witness got the committee off the trail of strictly un-American activity and onto Sex . Chubby , black-haired Helen Vooros , 19 , of Brooklyn , N. Y. , excitedly volunteered a personal history of membership in the Bund , characterized by wanton ( and unsuccessful ) advances upon her and others at Bund camps and during a Bund-sponsored trip to Germany . " There was all this immorality , " said Helen of Brooklyn , " I could n't get used to it . . . . " So she quit the Bund , complained unavailingly to Fritz Kuhn himself that a Bundster still pursued her . Said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what they call pure . When two people go together and they do n't curb their natural instincts , that 's pure . . . . It disgusted me. "
