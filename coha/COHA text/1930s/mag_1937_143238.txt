In 1926 , " moral turpitude " became a national catch-phrase when U. S. immigration authorities used it as grounds for barring entrance into the U. S. of Vera , Countess Cathcart . Countess Cathcart 's moral turpitude consisted of having been named as corespondent in a divorce case . Last week , " moral turpitude " suddenly popped up in U. S. headlines again for the first time in more than a decade . Occasion was the arrival in New York of Mme Magdeleine La Ferrire ( " Magda de Fontanges " ) , Parisian journalist and actress who last spring pinked France 's one-time Ambassador to Italy Count Charles Pineton de Chambrun for breaking up her self-confessed romance with Benito Mussolini ( TIME , March 29 ) . <P> Object of Magda de Fontanges ' visit to the U. S. was to capitalize on her misbehavior by appearing as a show girl at New York 's French Casino cabaret . When the Normandie , on which she had saved part of her first-class expense money by traveling tourist , docked in New York , immigration officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Fontanges was whisked to Ellis Island where , in an interview with ship news reporters she declared , " My only interest is to obtain a gainful occupation for the purpose of making an honorable living . " Same day the Board of Special Inquiry , making a delicate distinction between her case and that of Countess Cathcart , excluded her not because of her amours but " because of an admission of a crime involving moral turpitude , to wit , assault with a dangerous weapon . " Unless Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins reverses the Board 's ruling on her fellow working woman , Magda de Fontanges will be sent back to France this week .
