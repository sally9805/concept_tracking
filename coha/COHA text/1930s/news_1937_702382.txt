txt Chrysler Corp . has made a substantial increase in wages , which on the basis of last year 's operations will increase its wage bill by between 513,000,000 and $14,000,000 a year . This is believed . to be one of the sharpest pay advances made by any automobile manufacturer in recent years . The corporation made no public announcement of its action , but confirmed the increase when an inquiry was made as to whether it had adjusted its wage scale upward . No figures as to how the raise has been apportioned were made public . This advance , coming in the midst of the General Motors strike , appears in part at least to be based on the desire of the company to forestall possible labor troubles . Chrysler 's action may force other auto companies to follow with higher pay although no indication was available last night that such increases would be ordered . Chrysler has been liberal in its payment to its workers , and last year paid three bonuses totaling $8,300,000 which figured out between $100 and $155 to each worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured on a per employe basis , would indicate a considerably larger annual wage for 1937 than was paid in wages and bonuses in 1936 . Base Rates Are Increased It was understood that base rates of men and women workers were increased , with increases also affecting those in the higher wage brackets . The corporation 's employment is around 66,000 , with its principal operations centered in Detroit . Chrysler 's employment has been at a steady pace since introduction of its 1937 models . Operations have been at near capacity levels , with factory production and sales establishing new all-time records . Even before its principal competitor was closed by strikers , Chrysler was working against a heavy backlog of orders . This bank has shown little if any reduction it is understood , and capacity operations are indicated for some time ahead . Pay advances made in the past year by Chrysler and other manufacturers have lifted the hourly rates to the highest in the industry 's history and last year the average wage for the motor industry was some 40% higher than the average of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and also paid a substantial bonus at Christmas time . One of the demands made by the union in connection with its strike of 20 General Motors plants is for a minimum rate of pay " commensurate with the American standard of living . " This demand is in line with the union 's occasional demand for a minimum annual wage , an objective that is impossible so long as industry finds it impossible to schedule its operations for a year ahead with any degree of certainty . Ford Raised Wages Last Year Ford Motor also made wage increases last year , although its adjustments were not uniform and were never announced . In one month , however , that company made 37,000 wage adjustments , all of which were to higher levels . Smaller automobile companies also have in the past raised their rates , but because they have not been able to regain their former largescale production with its attendant advantages of lower unit costs , their profits have not been expanded to the point where further wage increases can be made without impairment of their profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
