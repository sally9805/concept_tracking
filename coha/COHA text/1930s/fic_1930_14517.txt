SCENE . The death-house of a state penitentiary . A tier of cells numbering from stage-left  --  to right : 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 . The audience is really supposed to be witnessing the action from the even numbered cells opposite . Therefore between the audience and the odd numbered cells is a corridor . At one end of this , stage-right , is a steel door leading to the offices and to the outside . Stage-left is another door of steel , painted green , opening into the electrocution chamber . The death-house is a one-story structure and through the cell windows that can be seen through the bars of the cell doors , the audience sees some distance away , the sky . TIME . The time is about nine o'clock , two hours before the hour set for Richard Walters ' execution . The month is early May .

I 'd like to be some place else now . p. 12 FRED MAYOR You 'd have been some place else if you had n't gotten that stay . RED KIRBY ( sighing ) . Huh ! How well I know it . But honest , I hate like hell to be in here when a man is goin ' to burn . JOHN MEARS ( quietly ) . You think you 're the only one ? You 're lucky , Red . You got a smart Jew lawyer .

FATHER O'CONNORS Yes , begin here . p. 22 RICHARD WALTERS ( reads ) . O my God , I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee , and I detest all my sins , because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of Hell , but most of all because they offend Thee , my God , who art all , good and deserving of all my love . I firmly resolve , with the help of Thy grace , to confess my sins , to do penance , and to amend my life . Amen .

( Exits cell , speaks to Mayor ) Well , boy , how are you feeling ? Walters sits on his stool and reads prayers . FRED MAYOR Swell . FATHER O'CONNORS I 've been praying for him . I think his soul is at peace . FRED MAYOR ( sarcastically ) . Yeah ! FATHER O'CONNORS ( unmindful ) . It is not possible for me to save his life or body . The Governor has refused to grant a stay . I 'm coming back presently to give him Holy Communion . I 'll stay with him then to the end . It will calm him and bring him nearer to God and Jesus . I always walk to the chair with the man I prepare for death and administer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without fear . p. 23 FRED MAYOR ( interrupting ) . All right , all right . I 've got two weeks yet .

FATHER O'CONNORS Why , you have n't slept for nights . JOHN MEARS Well  --  what 's the difference ? ( Suddenly ) Why the hell do n't you leave me alone , O'Connors ? FATHER O'CONNORS I 'm sorry . I was only trying  --  p. 24 JOHN MEARS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see ?

Aw , you 're like the rest of ' em . ( Slowly ) He 's scared stiff , in there . FATHER O'CONNORS It seems to me he 's very brave . JOHN MEARS Brave ?

FATHER O'CONNORS You 've got to have faith  --  in the Lord , and believe in His Son  --  the Christ  --  He promised  --  He died . JOHN MEARS That ai n't faith .
