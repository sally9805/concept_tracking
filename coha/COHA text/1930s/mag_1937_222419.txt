When Pilots Henry Tindall ( " Dick " ) Merrill and John S. Lambie , on leave from Eastern Air Lines , flew to England fortnight ago in 21 hr. , 3 min . ( TIME , May 17 ) , loose-spoken Radio Commentator Boake Carter snapped into his microphone : " Stunt flights across the ocean had their place at one time . Now Aviation has advanced beyond that point . Hopping to London to pick up some Coronation pictures and then fly back again may be a spectacular thing-but what does it contribute to the industry ? Nothing as far as one can see . The country does n't want that kind of pilot addicted to the lure of this kind of flight to fly it around the country . " <P> In London Pilot Merrill hotly protested that his trip was no " stunt " ' but " a pioneering commercial venture in aviation , " and in Manhattan Eastern Air Lines officials pointed out that passengers constantly request to be " put on Dick Merrill 's plane . " But some professional aviators agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilot Merrill relied greatly on a Sperry gyropilot in his jaunt but did not bother to test it or learn fully how it worked before starting . <P> To such criticisms Pilots Merrill &; Lambie presently made the best answer-another faultless crossing of the Atlantic . Laden with photographs of the Coronation , 15,000 " covers " and stamps for philatelists , they took off from Southport in his Wasp-motored Lockheed Electro . last week three days after reaching Croydon . Flying blind most of the way over the ocean , Merrill &; Lambie dropped down at Squantum , Mass. , to check their gas supply , immediately dashed on to Floyd Bennett Field , which they reached 24 hr. , 22 min. after leaving Southport . Their backer , Wall Street Operator Ben Smith who incorporated under the extraordinary title " Anglo-American Good-Will Coronation Flight Corp. , " at once set about selling his exclusive set of pictures to U. S. magazines and newspapers at fat prices ( see p. 17 ) . To Flyers Merrill &; Lambie will go 90% of the proceeds .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
