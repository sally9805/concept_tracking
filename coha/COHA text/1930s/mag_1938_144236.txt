In 1913 , when the late Enrico Caruso was in his prime and gut-busting Tenor Leo Slezak had just sung his Manhattan farewell , a stocky , brush-headed Italian named Giovanni Martinelli strutted the Metropolitan Opera proscenium for the first time , as Rodolfo in La Boheme . In an era dominated by the golden-voiced Caruso his debut was no sensation . Some critics , in fact , found his singing no great sensation . <P> Years passed and at the Metropolitan Tenor Martinelli continued to take second place to some more bravoed figure . When the great Caruso resigned in 1920 , died the next summer . Tenors Beniamino Gigli and Giacomo Lauri-Volpi were advanced to fill his place . Each was a fine singer , a fine egotist . Lauri-Volpi made it a condition of his contract that he was to receive more for each performance than Gigli . If Gigli got $1,500 , Lauri-Volpi would ask for $1,501 , would settle for $1,500.10. * Lauri-Volpi left the Metropolitan after two seasons , Gigli resigned in 1932 because the management attempted to cut his $100,000 yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded Italian opera to second place at the Metropolitan , and No. 1 Metropolitan tenor has become big Danish Lauritz Melchior . <P> But Tenor Martinelli has stuck . Though considerably worn in voice , he stays on as the best all-round Italian-style tenor on the Metropolitan 's roster . He knows many roles , is a dependable trouper . <P> Last week , therefore , white-haired , but still bouncing Tenor Martinelli had a gala performance given in his honor at the Metropolitan . Occasion : the completion of his 25th consecutive season as a Metropolitan singer . Participants were Tenor Martinelli himself and 18 of his fellow opera stars who sang scenes from eleven operas . <P> <P> *According to an anecdote in Opera Front and Back , by New York Times Music Reviewer H. Howard Traubmann , published last fortnight by Scribner.
