txt An Embroidery Book the firm edge which it gives is sufficient without extra stitching . Begin at the right upper corner ; make three small overcast stitches to carry the thread into position for working the first row , which consists of groups of three button-hole stitches worked loosely into the edges of the braid or material ; at the end of the row asten the thread to the braid ; again overcast three stitches ; work the second row of button-hole into the loops or spaces of the previous row ; continue in this way until the space is filled ; the last row should be worked into the braid , in order to keep the others in position . Plate X. has the central portion enriched by a filling worked in button-hole in blue flax thread . It is com menced from the centre ; the lines of the pattern are then followed towards the outer edges ( see description on p. 112 ) . Plate XI . shows a similar filling , in the flower at the corner , which is also worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of back stitch . A Diapered Border ( Fig. 12a ) . - Quite an interesting solid diapered background may be obtained by working these stitches in rows , in groups of three or five . The clusters are worked closely at the top ; the second row has the apex of each cluster fitting into the base of the preceding one . A very pleasing border in contrasting colours may be obtained in this way ; the 6o Button-hole and Border Stitches two firm lines of button-holing will , of course , form the outer edges . Double Button-hole ( Fig. 12b ) . ? Double button-holing has two rows of button stitch ( Fig . I2B ) . The first must have the stitches spaced so as to allow of the second row of stitches dovetailing into those of the first . This variety can be applied very successfully to braid or galoons , in which cases the stitches need not reach to the opposite side as in Fig . I2B . Leaves in Button-hole Stitch. ? A very good method of filling leaves is to work them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm central line forming the mid-rib of the leaf and the rather broken outer line suggesting the serration of the edges . Small flowers , flower centres and berries are frequently worked in this way ( Plate XIII . ) . The heading of the stitch forms the outline . An old-fashioned , but quaint variety of ground-filling to be seen on some of the earlier samples consisted of successive rows of these little eyelet stitches . The material was first pierced by a stiletto at regular intervals ; each hole was then button-holed or overcast round . The insertion of the needle into a common centre formed an opening which gave a lighter effect to the background . Decorative Back Stitch ( Fig. 13 ) . ? This figure is simply back stitch . To be effective and to make room for the interlacing thread 61 An Embroidery Book it should be worked rather larger than usual , and with a thicker thread , from one-eighth to a quarter of an inch in length . A thread of a contrasting tone is then laced through , eye of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Massing on to the next . Rick stitch was greatly in use in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries , for the adornment of all sorts of articles . Quilts , hangings , and personal clothing were ornamented in this way with bands and patterns . These were sometimes produced by chain stitch worked on the wrong side of the material , which , as an embroideress knows , forms a row of back stitching on the reverse side ? the right side in this case . Reversible Back Stitch. ? Sometimes these patterns were worked in reversible back stitch , in order to make both sides of the stitching alike , for in those days needleworkers did not grudge either the time or the patience spent on their embroideries . Reversible back stitch , so-called , is a running or darning stitch . All should be regular and equal in length , or the appearance of the work , when finished , will not resemble back stitch . The " back " stitch is formed by going over the line a second time with a running stitch , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and renders it reversible . Honeycomb Filling ( Fig. 14 ) . ? This pattern has an advantage over some of the more elaborate background stitches ; it is easily and 62 Button-hole and Border Stitches quickly worked , and most of the thread is on the surface . It is known to some needlewomen as honeycomb stitch , to others as Mexican stitch . To work Honeycomb or Mexican Stitch. ? To obtain the best result work the small foundation stitches in one tone and the interlacing in another . If worked on a material where the warp and weft threads are distinct the small stitches may be kept quite regular without difficulty , otherwise it is better to mark their position by means of a ruler and pencil . The spacing will vary according to the material and the thread used ; about half an inch should be left between each small stitch for bold effective work , and the second row should alternate with the first . When all are in position , a long thread is taken for the interlacing , which is done in rows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eye of needle foremost , pass through the first stitch in the top row , down to the second , up to the top row again , and so on , as shown in Fig. 14 . As the edges are undefined , this stitch requires a good firm outline round it . Table Runner ( Plate V ) of cream cotton canvas , or netting , is of a very open texture ; it is treated in a simple direct manner , which is both pleasing to the eye and interesting to the worker . It may be made of half-a-yard of material , 54 inches by 18 inches . The pattern is worked in wools and thick cottons , in stitchery eminently suited to the looselywoven texture . Method of working : ? Turn over on to the front surface a single fold of about i inch on each side and tack in place to prevent fraying ; later on these raw edges will 63 An Embroidery Book be covered with galoon or braid . Allow about 12 inches at each end for the wide hem , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre line by means of a measuring tape ; cut ten warp threads at each end of the bar , which in this material is about threequarters of an inch . Great care must be taken in cutting the top threads to see that they correspond exactly with those already cut . It is a good plan to draw the two outer threads a little , the tightening of which will indicate the exact place to cut the upper ones . This bar should be worked before the adjacent bars are cut . Leave a strip of material about half an inch wide on either side , then proceed to cut the weft threads , as before , for the broader bands ? each is about one-andthree-quarter inches wide , so that twenty-four threads are withdrawn . In weaving these wide strips , a frame is of assistance on account of the very soft nature of the material : the pattern should be easily followed from the illustration , but perhaps a few suggestions might help the beginner . Fig. 31 gives the method of weaving . Start with cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under side ; bring the needle to the point and weave , by passing over three of the double warp threads and under three , backwards and forwards , until these upright threads are completely covered ? it is necessary during this process to press down the threads closely from time to time , and care must he taken not to tighten the groups too much or the material will get puckered . Repeat these woven bars in different groups of colour to the end of the strip , which gives five groups in cream flax and three in colour , jade 64 Button-hole and Border Stitches green , reddish-purple , royal blue . Cover the half-inch bands of material with a herring-bone or oriental stitch , worked in cream linen floss embroidery thread . , Take up the strands in groups of three on either side ? this separates the threads into groups and simplifies the weaving of the next strip . Proceed now with the more elaborate weaving . It will be noticed that the weaving moves in a step-like manner , and that the pattern changes three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line from edge to edge is divided into threads . Begin with the green group and pass under and over four groups of thread ( in Plate V. the group worked in purple is the most distinct ) . Each group , as before , consists of three double warp strands ; weave one-third of the space , then leave out the fourth group ; continue to weave on three groups for another third of the space ; leave out the third group ; finish with two groups . Overcast one stitch into the canvas and weave over two fresh groups downwards for one-third of the distance , then over the next two groups of the second third ; then take up the two next groups and weave to the edge of the threads ? thus weaving diagonally in groups of two from the bottom of the bar , this last row produces a series of steps . Repeat the same in ascending groups ; finish exactly in the same manner as before , with the exception that the weaving over four groups is this time at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars of cream , woven over four groups . The cut threads at the top are button-holed to keep them secure . Lines of darning stitches connect the edges with the woven bars . The bands of galoon are now laid over the turned-65 An Embroidery Book over folds , hemstitched on the one side and buttonholed on the other , with dull blue ; a line of tacking stitch in cerise gives a touch of bright colour to the outer edge . Turn up about 6 inches at each end to give weight to the hems ; fill the central parts with darning stitches worked in rows ? it is best to mark off the central unworked space with lines before beginning this darning ; this serves as a guide and prevents the stitching from encroaching on the space . The galoon on either side is attached with buttonholing and French knots ? the spaces being filled with laid threads in cream , couched in the same colour . Latchet darns give emphasis and connect the green bars . Finally , the band of green is placed over the hem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button-holed with blue to correspond with the rest of the runner . Latchet darns are bands of weaving ; the upright threads are laid , not too closely , to represent the warp threads , then the weft threads are woven in backwards and forwards ; the edges are kept free exactly as in the other woven bars . These latchet darns make an excellent finish either to a bag , where they serve to hold the drawing-up cords , or to a dress , where they ornament or keep the belt in position . All strands withdrawn , when of a useful length , should be carefully kept . They can be used in many different ways to make cords , tassels , or fringes . // LAID WORK-BASKET AND LINE STITCHES " And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen , and thou shalt make the girdle of needlework . " A Sideboard Cloth. ? Plate VI . gives an example of a very handsome sideboard cloth . The canvas is of the tough hard-wearing type , generally used to cover basket hampers , but under the skilful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , with which one might well adorn a good piece of furniture . The illustration shows the design , which is of the simple straight-line type . The canvas , of rather a heavy weight , is of a rich warm brown ; the threads of floss embroidery linen are in rich blue , tussore colour , emerald green , grey-green , a pale blue-green and brown . The design is placed at the ends , where it forms bars and blocks of rich colouring . It occupies about 8 or 9 inches , 6k inches for the em broidery , and 22 inches for the wide band of braid . The stitchery is made up of bars of needle-weaving with bars and blocks of solid embroidery . The wide bands at the top and foot , enclosing the central portion , are of needle-weaving in a perfectly simple pattern . Each band is about z inch wide ; they are worked in blue-brown and three shades of green . The bar in the central panel is woven in tussore and light green , surrounded by a border in satin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Embroidery Book straps on either side are woven in bright blue with bluegreen crosses in the centre ; the chequered squares in tussore and blue are enclosed by emerald green bands in satin stitch . The background of the central panel is worked in chequers of blue tussore and light bluish-green ; the little crosses , hardly visible in the illustration , are all in emerald , while the darning stitch , which forms the background , is in bright blue . Square Stitch. ? The remainder of the background is worked in square stitch ( see Figs . L and M ) . A fold of the canvas turned over on to the right side has a frayed edge ; three or four threads are withdrawn ? this gives a pretty soft effect ; the fold is tacked down over a creamyfawn skirt braid , with lines of couching in tussore . These lines have the appearance of back stitching , but are in reality couched down ; they are sewn in that interesting method of bygone days , when embroiderers worked much in gold threads . " Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled through and caught underneath by means of another thread which never appears upon the surface at all ; this method has been applied to backgrounds worked in silk , as well as in gold ( p. 8i ) . It is economical in use and very durable . One can well understand the reason of its use , but not the cause of its falling out of use . Probably this was due to the gradual decadence of embroidery in this country towards the end of the fourteenth century , or perhaps the then new method of couching ? . in use at the present day ? involved less time and labour . The wide dark bar at the end of the work is of dark 68 Laid Work brown braid , about 22 inches wide , with straps of the lighter braid couched down in brown thread ; these straps are carried down over the fringe which has been added in the various colours with a crochet hook ( p. 115 ) . The sideboard cloth is 54 inches by 22 inches wide . The fringe is about 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective for the filling of large surfaces , where a bold definite mass of colour is required . It is a method of applying threads which gives a rich appearance almost similar to that achieved by the applique of some rich silk material . The stitches are on the surface only and are generally very long ; they have to be crossed and recrossed by other strands , which in their turn are tied down by little stitches . When worked in floss silk , a favourite medium with Eastern embroiderers , it is a stitch par excellence for showing off the beauty and lustrous sheen of the thread , but it is not a very durable type of work , and is therefore only suitable for such articles as are not exposed to hard wear , unless worked in wools or thick cottons . All the threads on the surface are " laid , " as the term is , in parallel lines either vertical or in whatever direction is best , in order to allow the couching lines to accentuate the form or pattern ; it adds to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely apart to begin with , as it allows the needle to get a firmer hold of the material ; the spaces are then filled up by working over the surface a second time. : Compare Fig. i5 and note first layer of stitches . For example , let us suppose the vertical threads are laid ? the horizontal ones , of another colour perhaps , could be placed over 69 An Embroidery Book them , about three-quarters of an inch apart ; small upright stitches , about half an inch apart , could couch , or fasten these down , one row alternating with the other . This is a most decorative method of filling in large flowers or leaves . Single petals can be laid diagonally , crossed and tied down , or a complete flower may have laid lines radiating from the centre , with the second layer of threads in concentric circles couched down with small stitches of a contrasting colour . Chequered or Basket Pattern ( Fig. 15 ) . ? Fig. i5 gives a plaited or basket pattern ; after the vertical threads are laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie easily ? just filling the form ? the weaving in of the cross threads is a simple matter . To work a Chequered Pattern. ? Begin at the right-hand corner and pass the needle over and under three strands for three rows , then reverse the chequer by lifting the stitches previously passed over . This work looks much better if the darning is all done from right to left . It is not so economical in thread , but much more practical on account of its greater durability , as the threads all lie the same way ; they are carried back behind the material instead of being worked to and fro as in ordinary darning . The Italian , Spanish and Japanese embroiderers make great use of these laid stitches which , like most other stitches , probably originated in the East , as they are to be met with in most oriental embroideries. 70 1 Line Stitches Basket or Stroke Stitch ( Fig. 16 ) . ? This figure gives another good line in rather high relief stitchery . It is sometimes called plaited stitch , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is most effective and useful for a solid line , whether worked on coarse material with a thick twisted thread , or on fine material with a correspondingly fine twisted silk thread . It has a strong resemblance to some of the plaited Slav or Algerian stitches . It may be easily worked on most materials , especially if a couple of guiding lines are traced before setting to work . Quite a broad border may be attempted which will look well if worked in a coarse thread . To work Basket Stitch. ? Bring out the needle at the top of the line on the left ; make a slanting stitch downwards to the right line ; pass the needle under the material and bring it out on the left opposite ; take a slanting stitch upwards over the first stitch to the right and insert the needle a little lower than the level of the first stitch ; then pass under the material to the left side again and bring it out just under the first stitch ; take a slanting stitch downwards again and continue by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be used as a surface stitch or as a filling for an open space . It is a method of interlacing 71 An Embroidery Book which one frequently finds on the seats of small chairs , in the construction of baskets and other wicker articles . It may be worked with the lines set further apart than those in the figure . The horizontal lines are stretched first , not too tightly ; these are followed by oblique lines which start from the left lower corner . The final row , also in oblique lines , starts at the right ; each row is inter-laced with two others . It is useful and most effective when used as a surface stitch , as a filling for geometrical forms ; when used as a lace stitch worked in a linen thread the lines may be duplicated . This net is gene-rally the foundation on which the design is made . Openwork Hems ( Fig. 12 ) . ? Openworked hems may usually be applied to all types of woven materials , to drawn thread work , and to household linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Method : ? Draw out the number of threads required ? this will always depend on the quality of the material , and varies from two to six ; lay the folds for the hem and tack them just above the open space ; fasten the thread on the left and insert the needle from right to left under four , five , or six threads ; pull through the needle and re-insert , taking a vertical stitch under three or four threads of the folded material . Plate V. shows a border of green galoon fixed with hemstitching on the inner side ; as the material is very loosely woven , no threads have been withdrawn . The same stitch is used for a heading for a fringe ( Fig. 34 ) ; it prevents the materia from fraying and collects the strands into groups . Ladder Hemstitch. ? A more open appearance may be given by withdrawing a few more threads and hem 72 Line Stitches stitching the lower edges also ; this makes a narrow insertion , for by grouping the same threads together , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider spacing ? the bars suggest the rungs of a ladder , and on this account it is generally known as ladder hemstitching . Vandyke Insertion. ? A vandyke form is also effec tive ; it is worked by grouping the stitches of the second or lower row , after hemstitching the upper row , in the following method : ? Take up half the threads of the first cluster and half of the second on the needle , then proceed as in upper row ; by dividing the groups of the upper row in this way a series of slanting stitches is formed when the lower row is complete . Antique Hemstitch. ? There are several other ways of hemstitching which only vary slightly ; perhaps the most decorative form is that usually seen on old em broideries , where the thread is carried round a narrow rolled hem , not a folded one . Method : ? Work from right to left , beginning at the right corner ; pass the needle over and under a cluster of four threads ; draw it out at the place inserted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it out on the left of the cluster , ready to take the next stitch , over and under the second group of four strands . Roumanian Stitch ( Fig. 18 ) . ? Cretan , oriental , or Roumanian are the various names applied to this well-known stitch . 73 An Embroidery Book It is frequently to be met with in the early English embroideries , particularly those of the seventeenth century . It is one of those adaptable stitches which are so helpful for the decoration of borders , fillings , leaves , flowers ; it has therefore always been much used by embroiderers . To work Fig. 18. - This figure hardly needs descrip tion , being merely a long stitch tacked down . Begin on the left of the space to be filled ; insert the needle on the right edge and bring it up in the centre ; take a small stitch over the stretched thread to fix it down and bring the needle out at the left edge again , just below the first stitch . If the thread is stretched loosely across as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a broad and effective means of filling narrow spaces or tacking a braid in position can be obtained with economy of time and material . To work Fern or Fish-bone Stitch ( Fig. 19 ) : This stitch , somewhat similar in form , also makes a good border line or even a filling , if worked in rows , see Fig . D , Plate II. , where a centre line of material gives the rib . In Fig. 19 the stitches meet in the centre and have a definite central rib . A central line should be marked on the material before starting to work it . Bring the thread out at the left ; take a slanting stitch towards the centre and insert the needle just beyond the line ; bring it out at the opposite edge ; take another slanting stitch and insert just beyond the line again . This slight over-74 Line Stitches lapping of the stitches in the middle gives the solid effect to the stitch . Chequered Fern Stitch. ? A pleasing variation may be introduced into a quiet border by working this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each colour will give a chequered effect , and help to relieve monotony if necessary . Work with two threads , bringing each to the surface as required . This stitch makes a good filling for leaves , the mid line being suggestive of the mid-rib . Loop-stitch Border ( Fig. 20 ) . ? This border is of the familiar loop or petal stitch . It has been already described ( Figs. 3A and 3B ) . It makes a very pretty border between broad bars of needle-weaving . The method of working is quite the same , the only difference being in the length of the tying stitch , which in this border forms the stem , while in the flowers it ties the edges of the petals ; the loops are thus reversed in the working . The border may easily be followed from Fig. 20 . Plate VIII . shows this stitch applied to the edges of the squares at the corners , where it serves to accentuate them as well as to soften their outline . Table Mat of White Linen. ? Plate VII . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central mat of an afternoon tea set . The design is of a very simple nature , composed by the loops and curves of the French tape . The main curves are formed of four short lengths which meet at the ends and sides . Each piece of tape 75 An Embroidery Book takes a curve at the centre and begins and ends with a spiral ; the outer sides can be put in with one length of braid ? eight short pieces will do equally well ; little remainders may be economically disposed of in this way . The inner parts of the curves give the opportunity for openwork detail which enriches , while it lightens the background . The design should be drawn out on paper . All lines which represent the braid must be parallel and spaced as nearly as possible to correspond to the width of it ; it is important to remember that braid spreads when curving and therefore the centres of loops or circles become smaller when placed on the material ; this must be allowed for in the drawing out of the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves and in tacking on the braid ; the beauty of the work would be marred by uncertain lines and unequal curves . Plate VII . has not much variety of stitch ; the relief given by the blue stitches prevents any feeling of monotony . Method : ? Tack on the braid round the outer edges ; overseam the inner edges of the parts which take the curves ; prepare for the more open spaces by snipping the linen , the way of the warp and the weft , quite close to the braid ; then turn the edges in under the braid and button-hole with blue thread , not too closely , the needle should enter easily into the head of the stitches for the making of the lace stitch ? " Point de Reprise . " These openings may be backed by small pieces of toile ciree ; a little medallion of button-holed linen should be placed in the centre and tacked firmly in 76 A Table Mat place . The connecting threads for the weaving of the little bars or bridges are laid in two or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Begin at the outer edge ; carry the thread to the inner medallion , and slip the needle , eye first , through a loop of button-hole stitch ; overcast the next one , and carry the thread from there back to the outer edge ; then weave over and under these two strands till the centre is reached . Oversew one or two button-hole loops and lay the threads for the next bridge ; this , when woven , will finish at the outer edge again . Oversew the stitches until the position for the next bar is reached , and continue till the circle is filled in . The corners are worked similarly with a few added bridges here and there to fill in spaces , which would otherwise be rather empty . These oval openings and ends might be worked in what is known as Richelieu work , instead of in the manner described . It is rather a quicker method , but not quite so firm , nor are the bars so flat . Method : ? Button-hole the inner edge of the space , also round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three strands of thread as the foundation of the bridges ( see Fig. 24 ) ; button-hole these to the edge and oversew the button-hole stitches of the outer edge until the thread is in position for the next strap . When the work is finished , the linen under the bars is carefully cut away with a very sharp pair of embroidery scissors . Run round the outer edges of the spaces which are to be filled in with a filet or net pattern with two rows of tacking stitch to strengthen , and button-hole over this . 77 An Embroidery Book To prepare the mesh background , turn on the wrong side , then cut six and pass six horizontal threads alternately ; remove the cut threads ; turn the work half round and prepare the threads , previously the vertical ones , in the same way , that is , cut and withdraw six , pass six . Turn the work to the right side again and oversew the strands , one stitch into each little space , taking care to let the stitches slant in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in connection with Plate XV . The braid has a row of French knots in blue to finish the inner edge . For the finishing of the edges of the mat , a firmer edge will be made by cutting the linen a quarter of an inch beyond the braid and turning it back under the braid , then button-hole this double edge and the braid together in blue . The little lace edge may be worked with the needle or with the crochet hook ; in Plate VII . the latter was used . The lower loops are worked in white , the edging in blue with picots is worked into it . For description , see Chapter XIII . on crochet edgings. // COUCHING-FRENCH KNOTS AND B LLION STITCH " When she rode in coach abroad , was always knotting thread . " COUCHING is a pleasant and most useful method of applying threads , cords or braids to materials of various kinds . For filling in forms , circles , or squares it is equal to chain stitch , and should be worked similarly ? all forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced from the outer edge and worked inwards , in order to preserve the shape . Special care is required for the outlining of squares or angular forms where the tendency is to tighten the applied material , whether threads or braids , in turning the corners . At these points the threads or braids should lie easily and they should be firmly sewn down with closer stitchery . Couching is one of the simplest means of decorating velvet , a material always difficult of manipulation , and particularly so for the beginner , on account of the pile , which is apt to cause irregularity in the stitchery . Couching ( Figs. 21 , 21a ) . ? This stitch is often worked in a frame ? it is easier to keep the material stretched ; when working diagonal lines or circles , where much of the stitchery comes on the cross of the material , it is advisable to do so . By means of couching , the embroideress may sharply define an outline , fill 79 An Embroidery Book in various forms , geometric or otherwise , repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal threads and braids to her embroidery ( Plate XVI . ) . It is a name applied to a method of attaching threads singly or in groups to a foundation by means of another thread , usually a single one . Under all circumstances this should be finer than the thread or cord sewn down . It is most economical in use as the threads lie on the surface ? a point well worth consideration ( Plate III . ) . Probably it was originally used for the sewing on of gold threads , which were too precious to be wasted , being made of pure metal ? naturally the difficulty of drawing these metal threads through the material would lead to the simplest means of attachment . At any rate , this method of sewing on gold threads was in general use all over Europe as early as the twelfth century . Couching is particularly useful as an outline to stitching , especially where a weak line requires defining . An irregularly sewn form , whether floral or geometrical , may be much improved , and the colour may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is most convenient for sewing down applied work . Primarily it covers the join , and is of considerable importance in aiding the colour 8o Couching , French Knots , Bullion Stitch scheme ( Plate IV . ) . Where simple treatment shows to advantage , couched threads , outlined with metal cord , give the necessary means of expressing taste and choice of colour , and with a little extra stitching to indicate veinings or whatever detail there may be , couching can again be applied with good results , instead of resorting to another stitch . It is worked from right to left ; the small tying down stitches may be straight or slanted , but they ought not to be placed too far apart  --  for simple decorative work , from a sixteenth to a quarter of an inch , the latter for the attaching of wools or yarns and narrow braids , the former for finer work . One of the commonest mistakes of a beginner is to couch with a thick thread , each stitch varying from a half to one and-a-half inches apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads . When couch ing a straight line with cord or braid it should be held rather tightly , while with wool or silk a pretty bead-like appearance can be got by holding the thread rather loosely ( Plate XII . ) . The fashion of sewing on a cord invisibly ? as in upholstery ? by untwisting the cord slightly between each stitch should never be resorted to for embroidery . Ancient method of Couching , " Point rentre et retire . " ? A most interesting method of couching , which unfortunately fell out of use , was practised up till the middle of the fourteenth century . The couching thread was on the reverse side , and was generally of strong waxed linen thread , which did not appear on the surface at all . The ground material was formed of two layers of linen , and the gold or silk thread was kept on the 81 An Embroidery Book surface , only penetrating the layers of linen at intervals where the linen couching thread had drawn it through . Some of the beautiful specimens of early English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum , the back-grounds of which are covered with couching done in this quaint and durable fashion , are well worth studying . The linen background of the Syon Cope is couched in coloured silk , that of the Jesse Cope in fine gold . The two lines on the outer edges of the sideboard runner , which has almost the appearance of back stitching , are worked in this way ( Plate VI . ) . French Knots ( Figs. 22a , 22b ) . ? French knots can be applied with artistic effect in many ways , not as an outline , but as an adjunct to some of the line stitches , such as chain stitch , couching , back stitch , etc . ( Plate XIV . ) . They may be used to add touches of colour to a pattern , to modify or enrich it ( Plate XIII. ) ; to powder backgrounds , either single or in clusters , qualifying both texture and colour ; to out-line or fill in flower centres , to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns or any form that requires some contrast of stitch or colour . Method : ? To work a French knot , bring out the needle at the point where the knot is to be ; place the thumb of the left hand over the thread ( Fig. 22A ) ; twist 82 Couching , French Knots , Bullion Stitch the needle once round this tightened thread ; turn the point to the right ? thumb still holding the thread ? and insert it just behind the point where it came out , and draw the thread through to the back , or when some experience has been gained , the needle may be drawn through on the right side in position for the next knot . The Chinese , who are adepts , frequently work entire pieces of embroidery in knots with such care and pre cision that they are almost mechanical in appearance . They have a method of knotting their thread first , then sewing each knot down . This method was also common in England about the seventeenth century . At that time ladies used to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small cushion and a netting needle , work a succession of knots on the entire length ; these hanks were wound up into balls ready for applying to the work in hand . It is better in making French knots to use a thick thread , or if a large knot is required , two or more threads in the needle are more satisfactory than twisting one several times round the needle . Plate V. shows knots applied to the edges of the galoon , which serve to fix it down , as well as to give a finish to the latchet darns . Bullion Knots ( Fig. 23 ) . - Bullion knots are frequently used in white embroidery where variety of stitch is made use of in order to relieve the mono tony . They consist of little tight coils of thread and can be used most successfully to form 83 An Embroidery Book the centres of large flowers , either in a mass or in pattern , Squares or lozenge-shaped forms with a French knot in each space make rather interesting fillings . Fig. 23 shows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre to form small flowers . Flower Centre in Bullion Stitch. ? Method of working : ? Bring the thread up on the surface at the centre ; insert the needle at the outer edge of the circle , and draw it out for half its length at the centre , beside the thread , which now take hold of with the right hand , and twist firmly , but not too tightly , round the needle six or eight times according to the size of knot required . Then place the thumb of the left hand on the coil and draw the thread carefully through till it is tight . It is always advisable to keep the thumb over the coil during the whole process if possible . A Good Flower Centre. ? Make a number of bullion knots to fit the circle , then surround the outer circle with one or two rows of close regularly-sized French knots . Bullion stitch may be used for small flowers ? each petal being made of two knots , meeting at the tip ? for leaves , inside fillings , ground powderings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picots in bt Ilion stitch . They arc generally worked into a bar or loop of buttonhole stitch , which may form an edging , as in Fig. 37 , or an open loop , as in Fig. 23 b . Picots of this type when worked in a fine linen thread are used for the outlines and edgings of laces . To work as Fig. 23 a , make the required number of button-hole stitches , then insert the needle for half its length through the head of the last one ; twist the thread round the needle from left to 84 Couching , French Knots , Bullion Stitch right six , eight , or ten times , according to the thickness of the thread and the size of the picot required ; place the thumb of the left hand over the coil and draw the needle and thread gently through ; keeping the thumb still on the coil , tighten the thread until the stitch has been drawn up into a small semi-circle ; then continue the button-hole stitch till the next picot is reached . Note Fig. 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is drawn through . If a larger picot is required , it may be made in buttonhole stitch instead of bullion stitch . Button-hole the bar or loop to the left of the required picot , and lay the foundation or padding threads for the picot by carrying a thread to and fro three times from the left to the right ; pass the needle each time through the edges of the buttonhole ; when the third thread is laid the needle is at the right side of the picot ; button-hole the loop closely till it is covered , then continue on to the next point . Openlooped button-hole edging looks very well with three bullion stitch picots , but the worker requires to be of a patient temperament , as each loop takes some time to work . Bullion knots are used very frequently in Mountmellick work . This type of needlework originated in Ireland ; it is of a very elaborate nature , generally done in coarse white threads on a strong white linen or jean foundation . Here monotony in tone allows for a great variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the patterns in which it is worked are mostly of a bold conventional floral type ; most of the stitches used are those which give a raised effect , such as the different 85 An Embroidery Book linked stitches , chain , cable , raised-stem stitches , French and bullion knots , and padded satin stitch . The flowers are filled in with a great variety of lace stitches . Button-hole bars are useful for connecting two edges such as the two sides of a lined bag , the seams of a child 's frock , or for adding a false hem to any dainty article . They are in common use for modern openwork embroidery , where they form connecting links between the various parts of the design . Button-hole Bars ( Fig. 24 ) . ? Fig. 24 shows the method of working connecting bars . The objects to be joined together may be of any shape , provided the lines are more or less parallel with each other . Begin by button-holing one part of the work , which will give a basis or line into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be joined to it a few stitches , until the place where the bar is to be is reached ; lay each of the threads into a different loop of the button-holing ? this gives a greater strength and wider surface to work upon ; when finished , button-hole along the edge as before , until the next point where a bar is to be worked is reached . These bars are worked over three threads , and should , when worked in lines , be made before the material is cut , otherwise it is better to have the two parts to be joined tacked down on to a piece of stiff linen , glazed calico , or brown paper . A Luncheon Set .  --  This illustration gives a table centre in cream canvas embroidered in bright blue , 86 Couching , French Knots , Bullion Stitch green , red , cream , yellow , heliotrope and black . The design is simple ; it is more or less governed by the mesh of the material and the method of working it , which renders the construction so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By examining the illustration it will be seen that the central portion of the design is occupied by a broad band of needle-weaving , about two inches wide , worked on the weft threads , the warp or vertical threads having been withdrawn to the required depth . The weaving forms seven separate groups , each of which is composed of two colours . The whole mass , rich in effect , is finished on either side with two bars of latchet darning ; these are worked similarly to repairing darns , but are left free at the sides . They are edged with an oriental stitch in blue which may be worked much closer and more regularly ( see Plate I. , where , as a heading to the band of needle-weaving , it has almost the effect of a braid ) . The corners , which balance the wide needlewoven bar , are worked in chequers of red , green , and blue ; the larger squares are in green , worked in a simple stitch similar to Fig. i 8 . A row of equally distributed petal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks the severity of the line ; seven lines of couching ? sewn in selfcolours ? connect the two ends . The edges of the cloth are turned over on the surface and finished with a row of blue galoon ? Prussian binding ; this is tacked in place on each side with little triangular stitches in green embroidery cotton . Through these stitches a thread of bright red is interlaced ; this is followed by a second one in cream colour . Large tassels ( Fig. 41 , p. 120 ) in 87 An Embroidery Book blue make a finish to the corners . Six little mats , 12 inches by 9 inches , when finished , were made to match , each having a border and couched lines similar to those of the scarf . Little blue tassels of appropriate size completed this useful little set . One yard of material , 54 inches wide , is required to make the complete set , that is the table scarf , 54 inches wide by 24 inches , and six little mats , 14 inches by to inches ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used for finishing the hems , after calculating the quantity an extra yard should be allowed , as with so many corners to turn one is apt to be too short in the end , and these braids arc often difficult to match . Wools and thick cotton threads may be used and a large-eyed blunt-pointed needle for the weaving and darning. // BRAIDS AND **32;965;TOOLONG SEAMS-KNOT INSERTION AND EDGING " There 's nothing neere at hand , or fartherest sought , But with the needle may be shap 'd and wrought . " Braids. ? Braids in different widths are invaluable to the embroideress who wishes to execute rapidly a piece of work suitable for daily household use , which may possibly be exposed to the smoky and foggy city atmosphere , and on which she does not wish to expend much time , labour , or money . Braids of various kinds and qualities ? mohair , alpaca , woollen , cotton or silk ? can be utilised in many ways , and for different objects , as well as for the finishing and decoration of hems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those which have an unbroken edge are the best for ornamental purposes . They may form the basis of simple geometrical patterns ( Fig. 45 ) ; lines may be arranged to go in different ways , running vertically from end to end of a table scarf ( Plate VI. ) , horizontally , as Plate III. , or diagonally ? the direction is immaterial ; all are simple to arrange , with the exception of diagonal lines , which always require care in the placing and stitching , on account of the different stretching qualities of the braid 89 An Embroidery Book and of the material . Sometimes the bands of braid are placed singly , sometimes in pairs , one braid ? usually in a contrasting colour ? being superimposed on the other . They may cross each other at right angles , they may entwine or interlace ( Plate X. ) , or they may be formed into circles or spirals ( Figs. 45 , 51 ) . The manner in which braids themselves are made , with the twistings and interlacings of strands and groups of threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designing of interlacing patterns , both simple and intricate ( Figs. 49 , 50 ) . The word " braid " is taken from the verb of the old Anglo-Saxon " bregdan , " or " brcdan , " signifying to weave , to entwine , to braid ; the latter word bearing , in those days , the meaning " to plait , " a word which came into use at a later date . The use of braid for decorative purposes has come down to us from very early times ? it has always been used by Eastern peoples much more than by those of the Western countries . Some of the elaborately worked pieces of Indian and Persian work , where tinsel braids are freely employed , are things to marvel at . The peasant costumes of many countries ? particularly those for gala days ? are made gorgeous by the addition of bands of brilliantly coloured braids , enriched in many cases by embroidery . Braids are used on uniforms , in an official sense , where they are considered as symbols of honour ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care must be taken with the arrangement of these patterns ? all curves must be exact , interlacing designs 90 Braids and Design must be correct , the series of bands always passing alternately the one under the other . The possibilities for the treatment of braids and bands , for the decoration and enrichment of them , open up an interesting field to the young designer . By comparing some of the plates it will be seen that much has been done in a simple way by the use of these braids and tapes . Many of the old illuminated manuscripts show wonderful interlacing designs , many of which were copied or adapted by embroiderers of the period . An old Venetian pattern book , published in 1562 , gives beautiful examples of the letters of the alphabet worked first with an outline in narrow braid , an elaborate twisted design being then woven in and out of the double lines with a narrow braid , with the help of a tapestry needle ; the delicate points and finishings of the letters being finished in satin stitch . Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of braid are to form the foundation of the design would be to take one form and try how it might be adapted to suit the conditions of space and material . A border for a circular form is simpler in construction than one for a square ? the corners of the latter always requiring special attention ? but after a few preliminary trials it will be readily seen what the possibilities are . Interlacing Knots. ? Interlacings of knots and bands are always interesting , and the working out of these designs should be a profitable exercise for a beginner . There is such variety in their construction , such simple or intricate patterns to be made out of these continuous 9 i An Embroidery Book and interlacing lines , that all craft workers have found in them a ready means of ornamentation . Knot designs of a simple kind may be applied in the form of braids and cords to many useful articles of domestic use ; the most direct way to work out some elementary designs would be to take a length of soft cord and some pins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation , or a covered table , pin out a geometrical design ? a square would be suitable for the first attempt ? and develop it . The first square might have the braids twisted into small loops at the corners , the second might have the sides indented or looped , and so on . Make a series of these with every possible variation ; then all could be drawn in a notebook , in squared paper ? for the sake of ease and accuracy . The ends of the cords or braids should be pinned together in order to form a continuous band . The next step would be to interweave a second length of cord into those already formed . Care is necessary to interlace the bands , so that each passes over and under the other in regular rotation . This second band might take the form of another square , set the reverse way , or a circular form might be introduced . When all possibilities have been worked out , they also should be noted . By degrees more complicated and intricate knots may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper to begin with , then interlaced and pinned out in cord . The embroideress will find a note-book and a square of canvas very useful for reference , also as aids to memory : in the former , she can make notes of 92 Faggoting designs and suitable detail , of colour schemes taken from pictures , materials and embroideries , suggestions for finishing and fastenings of garments , little notes and quotations suitable for embroidery ? all sorts of interesting matter which the eye is quick to see but which the memory can not always recall at the right moment . In the square of canvas or coarse linen , divided into sections , might be worked some of the more interesting or unusual stitches , or groups of stitches ; or pleasing combinations of stitches and colour might be preserved as the opportunity occurred . These might serve to suggest or recall methods and varieties suitable to some work in hand . Faggoting. ? Faggoting is a stitch which is used to connect two edges , particularly such edges as require a dainty finish , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foundation for some interlacing stitch . It is much used for joining ribbons , braids , or thin materials , such as ninon , chiffon , or crepe . Method : ? Prepare the material for faggoting by tacking it on to a piece of stiff toile ciree , glazed calico , or if that is not at hand , stiff brown paper will answer the purpose . This is done in order to keep the edges at an equal distance . The width of the space may vary from one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch ; the joining thread should vary in thickness ? the wider the space , the thicker the thread . Draw two parallel lines on the foundation as a guide , if necessary , and tack the material to these lines . If a braid or ribbon or any material with a finished edge is used , there is no need for turnings , but with a raw edge it is necessary to turn in three-eighths of an inch and to press them with an iron before starting 93 An Embroidery Book To work the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t-hand corner with a small stitch ; cross to the opposite side ; take a stitch , keeping the thread under the needle ; work alternately from side to side , always inserting the needle from the outside . Keep the stitch regular , the same size and the intervals of equal distance . Faggoting is practically a herring-bone stitch , but the needle is inserted vertically . See Plate I. and compare the stitchery in blue which forms a line up either side . It forms the foundation for many interlacing stitches of which there are quite a variety adaptable to various purposes . By interlacing threads as in Fig. 25 , where the dotted line represents the interwoven thread , the whole of the foundation stitches can be covered . It must be done in rows , one after the other . The first row is drawn much tighter than the one in Fig. 25 , each successive row being placed on the outside of the previous row , till eventually the faggoting foundation has almost dis appeared . A very good line of raised stitchery can e worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are laced in , one row at a time , as shown in Fig. 25 . See Plate XIV. , where it is worked round the outer edge , also in the nightdress case ( Plate XI. ) , where it forms the narrow inner border . 94 Faggoting " Point d'Alencon . " ? Faggot or Russian is one of the stitches used in the making of point lace or Honiton point . As a lace stitch , it goes under the name of Point d'Alencon . " It is used to join the braids ; it also makes one of the principal filling stitches for leaves or oval spaces . Veining ( Fig. 26 ) . ? Fig. 26 shows a well-known joining stitch , which looks well if done in a twisted silk , wool , or linen . It makes a pretty insertion , and adds much to the appearance of a seam . It is a narrow line stitch , therefore the two edges of the material should not be too widely spaced . Prepare the edges in the same manner as for faggoting and tack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fasten the thread to the edge of the material ; carry the needle across to the opposite edge ; insert it under and bring it through the material ; twist the thread twice round the needle and insert it on the opposite side from underneath , as shown in the diagram ; oversew a few stitches along the edge to carry the thread into position for the next stitch . This insertion is useful for joining braids , for dress fitments and other purposes ; it is much in vogue for the joining of thin materials , such as chiffon and ninon or crepe ; these require to have a fold laid and pressed before being tacked on to the paper . A very pretty addition to a border , whether for a piece of ornamental work , for the edging of a collar , the joining up of a bag , or for the foot of a jumper , is made 95 An Embroidery Book by inserting between the material a line of gold tinsel or velvet ribbon , braid , or even material of a contrasting colour . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calico or brown paper , then attached by an insertion to the edges of the material . This stitch , whether used as an insertion or as a filling , must also in this case be carefully arranged and regularly worked , otherwise the appearance of the work is spoiled . The threads should in all cases be tightened sufficiently to give the necessary firm twist to the line . To obtain the technique of many of these insertion stitches it is only needful to practise them for a few minutes on a piece of material as a preliminary to the actual working of them . This enables the worker to see what size of thread to use , and it gives her the opportunity of trying and comparing various colours without the irksome task of unpicking . Fig. 27 is worked much the same as Russian stitch ( Fig. 25 ) , except that it is worked closer and the thread picked up by the point of the needle before it is inserted on the opposite side ? this twisted faggot stitch is really a combination of the veining and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antique Seam ( Fig. 28 ) . - In earlier times , when the linens were woven in narrower widths , the seams were always connected in a more interesting method than at the present day , when , if a flat seam is wanted , the 96 Faggoting selvedges are invariably oversewn . One of the older methods is shown in Fig. 28 . It makes a firm , flat and decorative row of stitching . For the joining of selvedges of bed-linen a narrow slanting stitch sewn in white was used ; for more decorative purposes a coloured and a large straight stitch was used , as Fig. 29 . To work , lay the two selvedges parallel to each other and tack or pin them quite flat Begin on the left side and insert the needle from below on the right and left sides alter-nately ; in this way the threads cross each other between the selvedges . In connecting a very thin material in this way it makes a good finish . Fig. 29 gives an effective stitch for a decorative joining of two edges . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally . To work : ? Prepare the seams by placing the two selvedges flat on to a stiff foundation , say quarter of an inch apart ; secure the thread on the left upper edge ; insert the needle at the lower edge a little to the right ; pull through with the thread to the right of the needle ; // An Embroidery Book make a little stitch , as Fig. 29 ; pull through with the thread under the needle . This makes a good firm insertion ; a thick twisted thread is the most suitable . Fig. 29 shows the insertion rather widely spaced . Plate XII . shows this stitch worked in wool , where it is applied to the edges of braids , which form the foundation for a useful collar . A Useful Edging. ? Fig. 30 gives a knotted loop stitch which is again borrowed from the many useful lace stitches . It is an edging which may be worked in silks , flax , cotton , threads , or wools . In Plate XII . it forms the finish to the braid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This loop stitch makes a charming insertion if worked on to the edges of any suitable material ? narrow ribbon or hat straws . The working of the stitch is clearly shown in Fig. 30 . The two edges are joined with an interlacing stitch of a contrasting colour , with raffia , cord , or narrow ribbon . Bands of hat straw could be joined in this way and made up into delightful light and economical summer hats . The shape could be then placed over a foundation of wire and the brim stiffened with wire , button-holed on to the straw with a silk , flax , or raffia thread . A Collar of Braid. ? Plate XII . illustrates an interest ing piece of work , built up of oddments of skirt braid , silver tinsel , braid , silks and wools . Very charming dress and coat fitments may be made 98 Braids and Design in this way , and all sorts of scraps and remainders of trimmings and braids , silk patches and patterns may be utilised . The construction is very simple . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collars , cuffs , or bands is to cut out the desired shape ? the exact size wanted . The pattern is then placed on to a piece of glazed calico and the outline traced firmly upon it . A still more direct method is to cut out the pattern in stiff brown paper and utilise it as the foundatior cn which to tack the braids . Care must be taken " try . have the shape correct before starting to work with the materials . This being assured , arrange ' a ? brhid ' or cross-liar o material round the outer part ; tack i't at the outer edge with bright-coloured wool on to the paper foundation , then adjust the bars and panels , allowing the ends of the braids to slip under the outer braid . Circles or squares of ribbon , velvet , or tinsel , placed in the most important parts and tied to the outer edges with lines of braid or ribbon , which , in turn , might be connected with open stitchery , fork-pin insertion ( Fig. 73 ) , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for individual taste and ingenuity in colour and material . If the collar is on the round , the outer bands must be flexible , in order to take the curve nicely . The collar in the illustration has for the outer row a skirt braid of a soft dove grey . It is tacked in place with a line of couching in royal blue wool , sewn on with a silk thread ? reel twist is very good ? of the same colour ; the stripes of cream-coloured braid are ornamented with coral-coloured wool in long stitches , tacked down the centre to form a point . The smaller 99 An Embroidery Book panels have been placed in position previously ; they consist of chequered silk ribbon in grey and heliotrope . All the short lines are connected with Russian stitch worked in coral wool , the bands of cream braid being laid on over them and then sewn down ; finally the inner edge of the border is couched down .. The edges are now all tucked out of sight , the brown paper is cut away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made neat with tiny overcasting stitches , and the collar may either be lined or sewn on in place without lining , as the case ' may be . It is often necessary to confine the cut edges of the broad braid , in order to prevent them from spreading , by winding a thread round and tying it just above the part to be cut ? this often saves time and trouble in the long run . I00 CHAPTER X INSERTIONS IN NEEDLE-WEAVING-POINT DE REPRISEINTERLACING AND OPENWORK BACKGROUND " There she weaves , by night and day , A magic web with colours gay . " A Chequered Pattern ( Fig. 31 ) . - Chequered pat-terns look well in needle-weaving . A number of colours may be introduced if the spacing permits . Fig. 31 shows a diagram of needle-weaving which gives the method of working a chequered pattern on the upright or warp threads . Prepare the bar or band by removing the weaker ( weft ) threads ; a little decorative line of stitchery may then be added by hemstitching , button-holing , or herring-boning the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clusters which is an advantage ? it saves trouble when the actual weaving begins by keeping the weft threads in place ; cross stitch and oversewing are useful stitches for the same purpose . The worker should be careful to group the strands equally by dividing them into clusters I01 An Embroidery Book of three , four , or six threads . In Fig. 31 the upper row is hemstitched loosely , to show the method ( see also Fig. 34 , p. 114 , for hemstitching ) . The lower edge of the diagram is not hemstitched ; if the threads are woven in closely it is not always necessary to do so , although a line of stitchery is an improvement ? it softens the edge and adds to the appearance of the weaving ( see Chapter V. ) . Method of working Fig. 31 : ? Withdraw the threads of the material for three-quarters of an inch wide , and of the desired length ; cut the weft threads at one end and the corresponding threads at the opposite end . If the bar is long , correctness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single thread on the upper and lower edges  --  these will indicate the exact spot for cutting them without risk of mistake . Take a fairly long thread of wool and a blunt-pointed tapestry needle ; a loose but regularly-woven canvas is the best material to work on to begin with , and wool or flax threads give the best results . The threads are easily seen and counted , and there is not the same chance of their being dragged or over-tightened . Secure the thread by running a few stitches on the under side ; bring the needle up between two groups of threads ; pass it alternately over one group and under the other until a piece the size of the chequer wanted has been filled in . As the needle passes to and fro it should press down each row of weaving closely together ; this has the same effect as the " comb " which the weaver uses to press down the weft threads of his fabric . The first block being finished , pass to the next two groups by carrying the needle over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down each row with the needle ; the second compact mass will then be woven as in the diagram . To reach the next block , slip the needle down the back of the second chequer ; this will bring it into position to work the lower block . Continue in this way to the end of the row , always passing the needle ? at the back ? through the group of woven threads to get into position for the next block . Reversible Needle-weaving. ? These chequers may be worked in slanting rows , or they may form a vandyke pattern , ascending and descending in a series of little steps ; the V-shaped spaces between at top and bottom of the line may be filled in with another pattern or with rows of chequers in a contrasting colour . Both sides of the patterns are alike , and when the beginnings and finishings of threads are neatly done it may be reversible . This is one difference between needle-weaving and tapestry-weaving ; in the latter the work is done with the wrong side or back of the pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads , as well as the passing of threads from one part to another , all of which makes the one side unpresentable . Another Pattern. ? Some simple insertions may be worked by varying , slightly , the arrangement of the groups . Begin as in Fig. 31 , but weave over three groups of threads instead of two ; having arrived at the centre , carry on weaving over two more groups to the right and include the last group of the block just darned , to form the beginning of the new block . By repeating these groups of three alternately at the top and at the foot , always using the last of the previously darned block 103 An Embroidery Book as the first of the next , a pretty little pattern is formed  - -  a central cluster of threads is left between each block , which may afterwards be oversewn with a contrasting colour , or left with the warp threads of the material exposed . A very open and particularly effective insertion for a hem is made by working over two groups of four threads each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if preferred . Begin exactly as in Fig. 31 , at the left lower corner , and weave to the centre ; then take in one more cluster and weave in with it the last one of the previous block ; work to the top ; slip the thread down to the centre ; weave over two clusters , adding one of those previously woven with another group ; continue in this way to the end . By adding a new cluster to the one already in use the threads are pulled further apart , and a wider opening between the groups is the result . With these few suggestions , the worker will find that she can arrange and vary these insertions to suit her material and her own taste . Filet Background. ? Small squares , ovals , circles , or indeed any shaped space may be filled in with a net or filet background , then darned in with a simple pattern . The usual way of opening a square or oval ( Plate X. ) is to button-hole the form round the outside , then turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads at the edge ? near the button-holing ; draw and cut again at the opposite side these same threads . The who'e of the space is cut and divided up ; a bar of threads is left between each of the open spaces , always leaving the same number of threads between each three or four , and cut and draw the next three or four . When the 104 Insertions in Needle-Weaving horizontal threads are cut and drawn , cut the vertical ones in the same way ; when these are finished , begin to oversew each line , with one stitch into each hole backwards and forwards , until each line , horizontal and vertical , is oversewn . Care must be taken to make all oversewn stitches lie the same way . Note ? the preparation of the background is done on the wrong side . ' Little geometrical shapes and patterns may now be darned in . As said above , the number of threads left in between these open spaces may vary ; the fewer there are , the more open the squares will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a net background which can be worked in many different ways . The usual method is to oversew all the horizontal lines first , taking care to let the stitches lie the same way in each row ; turn the work half round to oversew the remaining lines in the same way . There is another way of making an open background which might commend itself to those who are averse to removing the threads , that is , by cutting the material which forms the background into narrow strips and oversewing the bars . It should be marked off in double horizontal lines rather less than an eighth of an inch apart ; place these double lines at regular intervals about half an inch apart ; rule them in chalk or pencil , then mark off the half-inch spaces into vertical lines an eighth of an inch apart ; these vertical lines are then cut two or three at a time with a sharp pair of scissors and oversewn one by one in rows , overseaming the upper and lower horizontal bars by the way . Very charming needle-woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes by button-holing squares or oblongs , cutting and withdrawing four threads each way and leaving eight between . When a square is button-holed ? with twenty-eight vertical and horizontal threads in the enclosure ? there will be four solid squares connecting nine open ones , that is , one open square in the centre with the four solid squares at each corner , and the open ones surrounding them . Each solid square has eight single threads surrounding it ; divide these into two groups by interweaving four threads under two and over two . When finished , there will be two woven bars connecting each side of the small squares with each other and with the outer button-holed square . These woven bars could occur at regular intervals among the more solid needle-woven portions . Many very charming things may be made in this way with woven threads . These primitive patterns can be worked with ease in such varied forms , alone or as adjuncts to embroidery ( Plate VI. ) , that an inventive needle-woman can ornament in rich colours , or without the aid of colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to weave regularly and keeps her design simple and suited to the material . " Point de Reprise " or Darning Stitch. ? Fig. 32 shows an insertion worked on a foundation or trellis . This stitch , which may be used as a filling for open spaces or for the decoration and joining of two edges , is an interesting one , and most effective when worked . In cottons , wools , or silks it could be applied to many different purposes quite suitably ; worked on linen with silk or flax threads , it might provide a dainty insertion io6 Insertions in Needle-Weaving for some article of personal wear ; worked in wool , it could decorate simply collars , cuffs and bands for a dress or jumper suit . Fig. 32 gives merely one form with the method of weaving , but there are many others to which the woven pyramid is applied . It is much quicker and simpler in execution than the button-hole pyramid , which is firmer but much more tedious to work ? the former , too , looks well in wools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Woven pyramids are frequently used by point lace workers ; this is called by them " point de reprise , " and applied to the fillings of circles and leaf shapes where the little cone-like forms work in very appropriately . The foundation of Fig. 32 is a double line of faggoting in Russian stitch ; a single line is worked first ; the stitches are taken widely apart , then a second row is worked between the spaces of the other , so that a series of little diamond-shaped spaces are formed as in Fig. 25 . Begin at the edge of the braid and weave the pyramid from the base so that the points may meet at the centre ; be careful to weave an equal number of threads into each cone-like shape , or they will vary in size . Pyramid Insertion. ? An insertion of alternate pyra-I07 An Embroidery Book mids , with the bases at the centre , is more open and does not take so long to work . Make a foundation of faggot stitch , a single row this time , then carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weave over two threads to the centre . As these little cones should always be worked from the point , carry the thread to the top of the braid by overcasting the faggot thread ; weave again towards the centre ; when finished , the bases of the pyramids will form a central line . An equally simple insertion and quite as effective is to work the pyramids in button-hole stitch on to each faggot thread . After forming the foundation stitches ? the trellis ? begin at the point as before , and work two button-hole stitches on each side before crossing over to the other side ; otherwise it is worked exactly as the former pattern detailed above . Two rows of faggot stitch may be used for the foundation of quite a number of different woven patterns . Little rosettes or wheels are formed by five threads ; at the junction of the stitches ? at the centre of the space ? are four threads ; add another by carrying a central thread to the first group ; work the rosettes over the five threads in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out ; when finished , slip the needle under the finished rosette to the next intersection of the stitches and work the second rosette and so on . Descriptions are always tedious to follow ? the best way is for one to work with needle and thread while another reads the directions aloud . Interlacing Stitch ( Fig . P , Plate II . ) . ? This interesting insertion stitch is one which will well repay the worker for her trouble in mastering it . Although not a compli-Io8 An Interlacing Stitch cated stitch , there are little points to be noted in the laying of the foundation threads which , if omitted , prevent the interlacing threads from working in properly . Fig. 33 shows a diagram with the method of laying the foundation stitches : ? One row is worked over the other ; this lattice work supports the interlacing threads , which also require two rows to work them . Fig . P shows the insertion completed . At a casual glance , Fig. 33 appears to consist of two rows of herring-bone stitch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of herring-boning is worked and compared with the diagram the difference will be noted at once . In working the foundation , let the threads lie loosely on the surface to allow for the interlacing threads . Method : ? Secure the thread at the left lower line ; take a short horizontal stitch , three-quarters of an inch to the right on the upper line . Note ? place the thread under the needle when drawing the stitch through ; this keeps the working thread under the diagonal stitch just formed . Cross to the lower line , and three-quarters of an inch further on take a horizontal stitch , but this time the thread is not kept under the needle , as it comes out on top and lies over the last diagonal . Proceed in this way until the end of the row is finished , then compare carefully with the diagram . Make sure before starting the second row that all the diagonal stitches beginning 109 An Embroidery Book at the left of the upper row pass under those crossing from right to left ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread under the needle on the upper row . The first row of the lattice being finished , start at the left of the upper line and work in the same way as before ; cross to the lower line , and take the horizontal stitch exactly beneath that of the previous row ; then slip the eye of the needle under the thread of the diagonal stitch and take the horizontal stitch on the upper line with the thread under the needle . Working in this way , little diamond-shaped spaces are formed . With the completion of the second row , it will be seen that the stitches are all interlaced over and under each other with the utmost regularity . For the inter-threading of the pattern , take a long thread and a blunt-pointed needle ; the thread only enters the material at the starting and finishing of the work . Secure the thread at the left in the middle of the space between the upper and the lower lines ; if an open insertion , it must be secured at the top . In Fig. 33 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes over and under the little crosses on the upper line and down to the crossing at the centre ; thus the first row of interlacing threads are all worked on the upper half of the foundation stitches . When the end of the line is reached , turn the thread round the last central cross and return , interlacing the threads on the lower half of the herring-bone foundation . Note , in passing to the centre of the line , that the threads interlace regularly with those of the upper row , as they must pass to the upper side of the central crosses . By this time it will be seen how beautifully these threads fit into IIo An Interlacing Stitch one another , but should any little mistake have occurred in the foundation stitches ? the supporting lattice work ? the equal and regular inter-threading will be found impossible . The thread must be chosen to suit the size of stitch ? the foundation threads are practically covered . n Fig . P they are shown rather too clearly at the edges ; also in Fig. 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lattice work , but a little practice will soon show the worker the size of thread suitable for a border ; a half-inch border requires a good stout thread to fill the space ? too thin a thread will make the insertion rather poor in appearance , while too thick a thread will make the interlacing difficult to manipulate . This insertion looks well with all types of threads , therefore it can be used for many purposes . For making decorative hems for household linen it is most useful , and gives one quite a pleasant change from the usual hemstitch ; it is also more practical , because much more durable . No threads are withdrawn ; a single fold of the material turned over to the front surface is the preliminary ; this is firmly secured by the two lines of herring-bone stitch . Large decorative initials could be worked with the same stitch ; placed in the centre just below the hem , they would look very well ? it would be better to draw these out on squared paper for the first trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the initial wanted . The insertion could be used for many purposes . In some of the old German linen work of the fourteenth century this stitch is applied to household linen ? in geometrical patterns to borders , insertions and corners , where it looks very appropriate ; III An Embroidery Book they are worked with white thread on white linen but there is no reason why they should not be embroidered on a coloured linen ? blue would look very effective worked in white threads or vice versa . At a later date , some of the Eastern countries adapted this stitch to their own type of work and design , convent " onal flowers being carried out with admirable effect in coloured silks . The worker would find this adaptation rather difficult unless she had done a fair amount of line work . Cosy Cover. ? Plate X. illustrates a piece of work suitable for everyday use . It is a washable cosy slip worked in white linen with a pattern in braid . In this example the braid is flexible enough to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as previously described in the nightdress case ( Plate XI. ) , on the outer edges , and gathered up with tiny oversewn stitches on the inner , to make the curves lie nicely . The design is very simple ; it is made up with French braid in varying lengths formed into curves at the corners ; the ground is of white linen . The braid is sewn on in blue cotton with a small button-hole stitch ; the little daisies of loop stitch and the surface filling of the centre are also in colour . The open web in the centre is a simple lace stitch worked in button-holing . Method :  --  Cut away the linen ( see description , Plate X. ) ; work round the opening a row of button-hole stitch not too closely set , then work ten loose loops similar to Fig. 54 . Catch the last loop of the circle into the first to join ; then on the last-formed loop work six buttonhole stitches ; pass the next loop ; work six button-hole stitches again into the following loop ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of the row . Work on in continuous rows until the centre is reached ; each group of pyramids must have one stitch less in each row as the circle becomes smaller . Finally , at the apex , the thread is twisted once round each loop ; carry the thread to the edge of the material by overseaming the edge of the first pyramid ; finish it off on the back of the linen . The square mesh for the open-work is prepared as described on p. 127 . The open-work clusters of the background may be grouped differently from those in the illustration , where they are oversewn horizontally and vertically . Quite a pretty variety would be to work them in diagonal lines securing each cluster with a knot stitch . Method : ? Start the thread at a part on the left where a definite oblique line may be laid . Work a stitch with the thread under the needle , through the stitch and tighten the knot ; carry the thread obliquely to the next cluster and repeat the knot . Another method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spaces with four open loops of button-hole stitch ; work each loop into half the cluster of surrounding threads ? the other half is used in working the adjacent square ; in other words , the open square is filled in with four little loops , the needle being passed through the first loop to join it with the last before passing on to the next square , and the clusters of loose warp and weft threads are divided and pulled apart by the loops , leaving a little oval-shaped opening . The edges of the cosy are worked round with loops ( see Fig. 57 ) . These finish the sides and serve as a means of lacing the two halves together . This manner of finishing makes for simplicity in the washing and ironing . e. $ . I I 3 CHAPTER XI FRINGES AND TASSELS-HAND-MADE BRAIDSKNOTS AND PICOTS " And bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments . " FRINGES are used to form an ornamental border for various articles ; they seem to be the most natural finish to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ways into simple or elaborate patterns , or they can be enriched with groups and bands of coloured threads or beads . The most simple are those produced by the unravelling of the horizontal or weft threads . In planning out a piece of work to be finished off with a fringe , allow 6 or 7 inches for it ? or whatever depth is wanted ; finish it after the rest of the work has been completed , as the frayed edges are apt to get soiled and untidy if unravelled before . y To prepare a Fringe. ? Withdraw a few threads at the head of the space and work a row of single hemstitching , or overcast it with large stitches . There is only a single ply of material , but this stitching , while giving firmness , adds a decorative value and prevents the loosening of the weft threads . Fig. 34 explains the I14 Mthod o hemstitching ; if the strands or warp threads ook rather poor and thin , additional weight may be riven to the whole by darning in either some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adding various coloured ones . Fig. 35 shows one way of adding threads . These are fixed into place most easily by means of a crochet hook . Method : ? Wind the thread round a piece of cardboard sufficiently wide ? that is , almost twice the depth of the required fringe ; cut the threads along one edge of the cardboard , and the strands are ready for use . Put the hook into the material near the edge from behind ; lay the loop of the doubled length of thread on the hook and draw it through , then slip the two ends through this loop and tighten ( Fig. 35 ) . Many pretty variations may be made by adding beads or narrow ribbons , tassels or knots ( Plate VI . ) . Those tasteful finishing touches add greatly to the appearance of the work . Knotted Fringe. ? Fig. 36 has the strands in groups knotted together , then divided and knotted again . These knots take up a fair quantity of thread , thus the length allowed for the fringe must depend an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the coarseness or fineness of the thread used . The thicker and // An Embroidery Book firmer the texture of the strands , the greater the length of thread required for the knots . The method of making the knots being shown in the figure , it needs little ex-planation . After the first row of knots is formed , the second row is made up of the groups of threads hanging from these knots ? they are divided , and half a group is taken from the right and left respectively . Three or four rows may be added in this way , each succeeding row of knots coming between those of the row above . A Flat Knot. ? Fig. 37 gives a flat knot used in fringemaking by macrame workers . At one time ( in the sixteenth century ) , priests ' vestments were frequently trimmed with this handsome type of fringe , consisting chiefly of knots grouped into various patterns . It was then known under the name of punto a gruppo " ; ' ater it was called macrame , from an Arabic word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for the trimming of bridal dresses . These knots can be added directly to a hem , or worked over a cord . Method : ? Arrange the thread in groups of two double strands , as in Fig. 37 a ; take the two outside strands , and passing the left one under the middle strands , and the right-hand one over them ? these middle strands mean-while being held taut between the second and third fingers ? bring the left-hand strand out , as Fig. 37 , and the right-hand strand under so that their positions are reversed . Complete the knot by crossing the reverse I16 Fringes and Tassels way again and tighten to finish . Quite a pretty fringe can be made by working a row of four of these flat knots in succession over four strands , one knot below the other ; the second row has the knots made on four strands  --  two strands taken from each of the groups immediately above ? this brings the knots of the second row alternating with those of the upper row , as in Fig. 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-made braid , very useful for many purposes , for small headings , or for finishings , edges , or seams . It is a simple plait made with four strands of any firm thread or narrow braid ? the latter is the more suitable for embroidery . Lace plaits similar to this require bobbins and a pillow , as well as a suitable lace or linen thread ; but the gimps for embroidery can be made quite nicely by fixing the knots to some firm foundation and winding the cord , string , or braid on to a piece of cardboard . The plait is done by means of twisting and crossing . These terms are used in the making of pillow lace . " Twisting " always means passing the right-hand strand over the left ( Fig. 38 A ) , and " cross ing " means the passing of the inner left-hand strand over the inner right-hand strand ( Fig. 38 B ) . Hand-made Gimp. ? Fig. 39 shows the braid in process . Each pair of threads is twisted once , then the inner threads are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being taken to keep all threads as equal as possible . Fig. 39A is the same braid with picot edgings . These picots may be placed at every second loop instead of I17 An Embroidery Book every fourth as in the figure . They are made with the help of pins fixed into the foundation ; the outside thread is passed round the pin before twisting with the next strand . To make a Lace Pillow-Cushion. ? Fig. 40 is a still more elaborate braid , consisting of five double strands . It could be more easily worked on a cushion ? a large pin-cushion tilted against a table would do , or the worker could make a pillow-cushion for herself , such as some lace-makers use , in the following way : Cut a piece of firm cotton or linen about 20 or 22 inches wide and 22 to a4 inches long ; join up the length by the machine hem the two ends and run a drawing string through them I18 Fringes and Tassels to close the ends . Cut two circles of cardboard 4 or 5 inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a circle of cardboard in against the closed end ; fill the cushion with bran or cork ? such as is used for pack-ing grapes ? horsehair , or sawdust ; stuff tightly ; then place the other circle of cardboard on top and tighten up the second end by means of a strong cord run through the edges . This little cushion can be placed into a wooden box or basket , which is better to be weighted a little to keep it steady . Some pillows are made like a cylinder and fitted into a box , which is higher at the back than at the front ; others are made with an axis which is fitted into grooves cut in the side of the box ; this enables the worker to turn the pillow and also allows the lace as it is worked off to fall behind into the box . Braid. ? To work Fig. 40 , fix on to the cushion in a straight line five lengths of braid , knotted as in Fig. 38 . Method : ? Twist the first and second pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ; cross ; twist the third and fourth pair once ; cross ; twist the fourth and fifth pair once ; cross ; place a pin at the right-hand edge ; twist the fourth pair once ; twist the fifth pair once ; cross ; twist the third and fourth pair once ; cross ; twist the second and third pair once ; cross ; twist the I19
