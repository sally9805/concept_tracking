While the Senate was busy wondering : 1 ) whom the President would appoint to the Supreme Court vacancy created last June 2 by the retirement of Justice Willis Van Devanter ; and 2 ) whether he would make his appointment before Congress adjourned , Idaho 's gaunt old lion , Senator William E. Borah , last week gave it something new to wonder about . Said he on the Senate floor : <P> " Certainly the President can not name a successor until there is a vacancy and I challenge any lawyer here to say there is a vacancy . . . " <P> Less astounding than it sounded , Senator Borah 's contention was based on a fine definition . The U. S. Constitution provides that " The judges , both of the Supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behavior , and shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office . " Because the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes resigned and accepted a pension which in 1932 was cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retirement Act was passed this year to give elderly justices a better reason for quitting . It provides that they may retire ( i.e. , go on inactive duty , subject to call if needed ) thereby continuing in office in the sense that their pay may not be diminished . How , asked Mr. Borah , if Justice Van Devanter , who retired two months ago , is continuing in office can there be a vacancy on the bench ? <P> To a body packed with lawyers , nothing is more fun than a brisk game of splitting verbal hairs . One of the first to take up Senator Borah 's challenge was Arizona 's bland Senator Ashurst , who attempted to obliterate the Borah argument by a reductio ad absurdum which resulted in dialog that sounded like the Mad Hatter 's tea party : <P> Ashurst : Suppose the entire membership of the Supreme Court of the U.S. should suddenly become insane . . . ? Suppose there was something which would take the reason prisoner , and that each and all , en masse and en bloc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant them retirement privileges and retirement pay . Does the able Senator say the President could not nominate a new Bench ? <P> Borah : I say the Congress of the U. S. could not get rid of nine insane men except through the power of impeachment . That 's what was done in the days when the Constitution was observed . . . . <P> Ashurst : Suppose the Justices of the Supreme Court of the U. S. for their country 's good should all retire en bloc , en masse . . . ? <P> Borah : . . . I am going to say that until a vacancy is created either by the hand of God or by impeachment . . . or by resignation . . . there is no office for the President to fill . . . . <P> Ashurst : . . . Suppose during the session of Congress the President should nominate a man for Associate Justice . . . and he should be confirmed by the Senate . . . . We should have ten judges of the Supreme Court should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That is all I contend . <P> Borah : . . . The statute today says that the Supreme Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and eight associate Justices . . . .
