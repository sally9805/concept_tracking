In 1922 , heralded by reports that he possessed only one speech and no evening clothes , Smith Wildman Brookhart went to the U. S. Senate as a bull-shouldered , thick-skinned representative of Iowa . Both reports proved correct . His speech was an impassioned attack on the Interests , the Railroads , the Wets . His dress at swank Washington parties was a plain sack suit . His pugnacious cowhide radicalism nettled patrician Senators , and in a close election contest in 1924 the Senate chose to seat his opponent . In retaliation he won a smashing re-election in 1926 . In 1932 , annoyed by disclosures that he had placed two brothers , two sons and one daughter on the Federal payroll , lowans turned Republican Brookhart down . Promptly he wangled an AAA position in Washington as " special adviser " on Russian trade . Last year he quit . <P> Last week Smith Wildman Brookhart informed Iowa voters that he was prepared to move back into the Senate . Already there are four other Republican candidates out for the seat now held by Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make things much easier for him in the June primaries . Candidate Brookhart put forward a platform calculated to outdo the AAA : export dumping , price-fixing on crops , etc. , etc.
