When Brothers John &; Gardner Cowles Jr. , publishers of the Des Moines Register &; Tribune , started Look ten months ago they had no idea whether they would sell 60,000 or 600,000 copies . First issue of the 10 monthly gravure picture magazine was a 705,000 sellout , and the present 1,700,000 circulation came in generous leaps &; bounds as the monthly became a fortnightly . But Look did not decide to accept advertising until three months ago when the Brothers Cowles took Ned Doyle , a wiry , 34-year-old Hibernian , from the eastern advertising managership of Cosmopolitan . Mr. Doyle was given 13 solicitors and sent to sell space , warned not to accept hard liquor , beer or objectionable patent medicine ads . <P> Last week the first adbearing issue of Look turned up with 10 ? pages ( some $37,000 worth ) from Chesterfield , Dodge , Universal Pictures , Sal Hepatica , Kleenex , Feen-a-mint , other medicinals &; knickknacks . Ned Doyle 's crew is concentrating on the 1938 schedules , since Look will guarantee 2,000,000 circulation effective May 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In ten months Managing Editor Vernon Pope has had to increase Look 's initial budget ten times , so the magazine has netted only $10,000 an issue , all of which has been turned back into promotion .
