She was blowing a gale last week off Brazil 's coast . Rain speared down in steel-grey phalanxes . Big , angry combers blew their tops . Battling pluckily through the maelstrom panted the little ( 248-ton , 36-meter ) coastal steamer Itacare . She was out of Sao Salvador on her regular haul to Ilhos , Bahia . She carried 47 passengers , a crew of 19 , was heavily cargoed . Skilfully had young , but seasoned Captain Carlos Oliveira skippered her to within hailing distance of Ilhos . Another 300 yards would find her in safe harbor . <P> On the wharf friends and kin of the Itacare 's passengers braved the ugly weather to greet them . They watched the steamer strain closer , her prow dishing up small seas at every step . Suddenly a huge wave whammed her , sideslipped her into a deep sea-trough . Next instant she dived prow-first . Down she sank , spewing out 36 of her passengers &; crew , drowning the rest . It was one of the worst sea disasters of recent years . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , death on insecurely stowed cargo .
