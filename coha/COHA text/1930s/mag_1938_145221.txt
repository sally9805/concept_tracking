In touching Harry Hopkins on the Cabinet nerve ( see col. 1 ) , Pundit Arthur Krock was not being malicious or fanciful . Ever since election the prospect of Mr. Hopkins ' being elevated officially to Cabinet rank ( he already attends Cabinet meetings ) has been vigorously chattered . At a meeting of 21 Democratic leaders with National Chairman Jim Farley last week in Manhattan , the Hopkins boom was discussed and all 22 thumbs were reported turned down on it . Actually , the Hopkins chances were never good . <P> Meantime , the destiny of WPA , even before it is investigated by Congress , was becoming apparent . In response to President Roosevelt 's warning that its 1938 appropriation must be made to last through February ( TIME , Oct. 24 ) , WPA rolls , which had risen steadily since October 8 to a peak of 3,262,669 on November 5 , began to be cut last fortnight , chiefly by not replacing clients who left to enter private employment . By last week 's end they were down considerably from the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite henchman , Franklin Roosevelt was studying projects for WPA more popular than road-patching and leaf-raking . Plan is to divert WPA men and millions into the big new act of the Fourth New Deal , rearmament ; to set WPAsters to building airports , barracks , arsenals ; training boys under the National Youth Administration to become airplane mechanics . <P> Also well in advance of Congressional action , Harry Hopkins , whose politics are certainly not petty , last fortnight declared : " The American people resent , will resent and should resent the injection of petty politics into unemployment relief work . They do n't like the idea that anybody gets a job because he has political influence ; they do n't like the idea that anybody gets his pay raised because of political influence ; they do n't like the idea that he gets fired because of that . They are quite right . My feeling about it is this ; that I would put this organization or any organization like it , lock , stock and barrel , under Civil Service-the whole works under Civil Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
