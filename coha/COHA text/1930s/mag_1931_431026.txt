p 416 Hindenburg Condensed from The Yale Review ( Summer , ' 31 ) Harold Nicolson Former Counsellor to the British Embassy , Berlin I FIRST saw Hindenburg at a ceremony in the Reichstag . His face had , of course , been long familiar to me from endless photographs . And always , when I thought of him , I regarded him as an emblem , stylized and formidable as a figure in a pack of cards . Was I wrong ? No I was far less in error than I have sometimes supposed . The occasion to which I refer was the tenth anniversary of the foundation of the republic . In the Reichstag building the space reserved for Hindenburg and his personal staff had been draped so as to resemble a tent upon a field . The entrance was closed by curtains . At a sudden word of command the curtains were flung open by two officers in field-gray uniform . And then slowly , uncertainly , emerged a huge figure in a gigantic black frock coat , holding in his gloved hand an immense top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed suddenly to shrink in size . The Hindenburg of the pictures wears invariably a dominant and sturdy look . He frowns . Was this bewildered octogenarian , this vast veteran who seemed to totter to his chair , indeed the victor of Tannenberg , the conqueror of the Masurian Lakes the idol and the terror of half the world ? No , it was not . It was merely dear old Papa Hindenburg . And the strange thing about it is that he had been Papa Hindenburg all along . No man has ever had a legend so fantastically thrust upon him . Later I had several successive visions of the Teutonic hero . They left the impression of a scarcely animate idol , of a wholly impersonal organism christened " Hindenburg " and preserved as some racial totem . And then I met him face to face . The Maharajah of Patiala came to Berlin and was received by the President . I accompanied the Maharajah as interpreter . When we were ushered into the President 's sitting room , he bowed formally . A long pause followed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to repeat his lesson . " Your Highness , " he said , " is , I understand , the leader of the Sikhs ? " I translated , and the Maharajah indicated that the President was not incorrect in  | this surmise . " And the Sikhs , " continued Hindenburg , " are the bravest of all Indian races . " The Maharajah bowed slightly at this compliment , and added that a reputation for great courage had also been gained by the Gurkhas . " Tapfer , " I translated , " sind auch die Gurken . " " Die amiss ? " boomed the President in startled surprise . " Die Gurken " I repeated , explaining that they were an Indian tribe . At this the vast bulk of the President began to heave and rumble . His shoulders shook . He slapped me heavily on the knee . He rolled with laughter , and his little eyes shone with merriment . For the word " Gurken , " it will be remembered , signifies in German those little cucumbers which they delight to pickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential guffaw to the Maharajah . He smiled politely and bowed so that his diamond earrings twinkled gaily . And the ice was broken . Thereafter the President always chuckled when he saw me . And the final impression thus left is one of an immense and genial child . After the war Hindenburg wrote his memoirs . One passage runs : " The decisive factor in my life was not a desire for any applause from the world . It was rather my own convictions , a sense of duty , and my own conscience which have guided me throughout my life . " Many other men might have written this sentence . But when Hindenburg writes it , one knows that it is true . For Hindenburg , as his English biographer has written , " possesses a genius for sincerity . He was born , on October 2 , 1847 , of an old Junker family . His grandfather had served in the Napoleonic wars . His father , Robert von Hindenburg , was also an officer . " It was not , " wrote Hindenburg , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I became a soldier as a matter of course . " The military discipline which he saw around him was reflected in the discipline of his home . His father , and even his mother treated him as a recruit . He was never allowed to ask questions . Three things alone were taught him : God , the Fatherland , and the King . Nothing else mattered . At the age of 11 he was sent to a cadet school . The boys were encouraged to believe only in physical prowess all intellectual energy was sharply discouraged . " Since my days as a cadet , " wrote Hindenburg , " I have never read a book that did not deal with military affairs . " At the age of 18 he was decorated for courage in the war against Austria . In 1870 , during the Franco-Prussian war , he received  | the Iron Cross at Gravelotte . He was part of the army which besieged Paris . And he was present at Versailles when the German empire was proclaimed . There followed 40 years of regimental duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he studied the military geography of the frontier between Germany and Russia . Few men had shot duck so frequently in the Masurian marshes . He knew every inch of the ground . And it was this hobby which brought him , years later , immortal fame . In 1911 he had retired from the army ; and to the German public of 1914 this former soldier of nearly 70 was completely unknown . But when , in August of that year , the High Command decided that the Russian invasion of East Prussia must be stopped , they were told that an old dugout was living at Hannover who knew all about the Eastern front . Von Hindenburg received a telegram from the Emperor , asking if he were ready for immediate service . He replied " Am ready , " and hurried to put on his uniform . He was told that General Ludendorff had been appointed his Chief of Staff and would explain everything . He did . Four days later began the battle of Tannenberg . The Russians lost 350,000 men , the Germans only 37,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the victory of Tannenberg , one of the greatest in history . It had been prepared by von Prittwitz , elaborated by General Hoffmann , improved by Ludendorff , and was carried out by General von Francois . But Hindenburg , as Commander of the Eighth Army , as the man who signed the telegrams , got all the credit . Within a few weeks his portrait was in every home . He was invincible , majestic , infallible . Huge wooden statues of Hindenburg were erected in the larger towns . Millions flocked to pay them homage . He became Commanderin-Chief . Ludendorff remained his right-hand man . Paul von Hindenburg was immensely embarrassed by all this adulation . He understood nothing about politics and disliked them . Ludendorff also understood nothing about politics but liked them very much indeed . It was under his influence that decisions were made . They were bad decisions . In the autumn of 1918 came the crash . Ludendorff escaped to Sweden disguised in huge tinted spectacles . Hindenburg remained . Puzzled and distraught he learned that a republic had been proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland . He himself remained behind with what was left of the army , and tendered his services to the re ( Continued on page 422 )  | ( Continued from page 418 ) public . It was his duty . After the Treaty of Versailles was signed , he returned to his little flat in Hannover an old , unhappy man . For six years he remained there honored , aged , and unimportant . Then in 1925 came another summons . President Ebert died suddenly . None of the political parties could agree on his successor . Friends of Hindenburg called on him to stand for the presidency . They urged that it was his duty . The old war horse was fired by the use of this watchword . He agreed . He polled nearly fifteen million votes . And there he remains today in his presidential palace , an almost mythical figure , the emblem of the sacred continuity of German tradition . The German people have nearly every quality , but they lack self-confidence . Being romantic by nature , they love to create mythological figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those figures . He is not intelligent , and , in fact , his mental processes are as simple as those of a child . His actions as President have been taken invariably on the advice of others . But his solidity of structure and outlook , the astounding permanence of his very presence , act as a tonic upon his countrymen . And his sublime sense of duty and of service responds to all that is finest in the German character .
