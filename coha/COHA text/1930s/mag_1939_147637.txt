As dull and darkly melancholy as a three-volume peasant tragedy has been the story of U. S. housing . Many a good citizen , trying to keep awake through a synopsis of the preceding chapters , has found his spirit saddened , his eyes closing , his head nodding . To maintain even its present inadequate housing level , the U. S. needs 525,000 new housing units a year for ten years . Under present conditions , the nation has no chance whatever of reaching this total . <P> Last week a new author took over the old plot , streamlined it , added exciting new characters , put a punch in every scene . Author of this revised version was a bulky , mustached Yale professor , a Don but no Quixote , Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold . Since the construction industry protractedly has proved it can not cure its own ills , Mr. Arnold sees only one alternative-action under the antitrust laws ( which he enforces ) . <P> Weapon . For the first time in history , the antitrust division is ready , willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the passage of the antitrust act-the U. S. had five lawyers and four stenographers to enforce action on the law . In 1933 there were 18 people in the antitrust division of the Justice Department . Their major problem was to keep awake in the warm Washington afternoons . Last week Mr. Arnold had behind him upwards of 160 lawyers , all of them loaded with shrapnel and ready to fire . <P> One-fourth of all antitrust complaints have been about the building industry , where restraints of trade are found from cellar to roof : producers of building materials , distributors , contractors , subcontractors , labor unions , and in local legislative restraints of trade , such as building " regulations " that only thinly veil protective tariffs set up for the benefit of local monopolies . ( Arnold cites the fact that the plumbing in the magnificent $10,000,000 Department of Justice building is arbitrarily ruled not good enough for private homes in some cities . ) <P> With building costs flexible up but not down , material-makers have priced themselves out of the market . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costing more than $4,000-last year only 15% of all homes built were in that price range , and that figure was attained only through substantial Government aid-Federal , State , municipal . <P> On the thesis that no other industry has so completely failed to run itself , that none other has so conspicuously burdened the nation with mass unemployment , Arnold trained his batteries on the building trades , last week gave the signal to fire .
