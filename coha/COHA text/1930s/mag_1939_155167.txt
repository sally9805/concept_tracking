MARXISM : AN AUTOPSY-Henry Bamford Parkes-Houghton Mifflin ( $3 ) . <P> Any readers who think they are being invited to a rip-roaring wake over Communism 's corpse will find that Henry Bamford Parkes , despite the title of his book , has no such jamboree in mind . Even Marxists may concede that the body of their belief , with all its nobility of purpose , its elaborate doctrine , its often tragic record in action , has rarely undergone such delicate surgery . For the argument of this book goes far deeper than any current disillusionment with a " discredited " Communism . <P> During the past ten years men of good will , trying to escape the Left-Right dilemma , have been bravely challenging defeat , whooping up democracy , deploring dictatorship , condemning war , and agreeing that not much can be done about it all . To reflective witnesses , however , even the best " liberal " thinking has seemed about as far behind the times as Montesquieu 's and Jefferson 's was ahead of theirs . Parkes 's book catches up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at New York University , previously known for a brilliant History of Mexico and for a few remarkably lucid essays , Parkes has tested the dogma of the Left in the light of history and reason , drawn his conclusions , brought them into sharp focus with political facts , and thereby outlined a progressive program with at least theoretical drive and good sense . <P> History . Karl Marx believed and taught that the industrial proletariat was inherently revolutionary , that its numbers and miseries would increase , that its conflict with the capitalist class would intensify , that eventually it would be able to overthrow the " bourgeoisie , " and that , after the revolution , classes would disappear in a new kingdom of freedom , and government would " wither away . " <P> Parkes demonstrates that by 1914 the working class had almost universally developed a tradeunion , not a revolutionary , point of view ; that the stronger the union movement became , the less revolutionary were its purposes ; that the proletariat 's size was reduced by machinery , its miseries by reform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been wrong . Instead he formed the Communist Party to lead the working class , not to what it seemed to want but to what Marx had decided it ought to want . And to win the Russian Revolution , Lenin had to diverge from Marxism again by giving property-land-to the peasants . <P> Lenin 's great experiment established a dictatorship , nominally " of the proletariat , " actually of the Communist Party and eventually of Stalin alone . New class distinctions arose between workers , managers and bureaucrats . The Soviet Government has so far shown no signs of withering away-though Communists expect it eventually to do so . Meanwhile outside Russia the sometimes heroic Communist International has been effective in nothing so much as in scaring the pants off the middle class . <P> Theory . The failures of Marxism in practice argue fallacies in theory . The first of these , according to Parkes , is the idea that the working class alone can , or will , seize political power . The modern working class and the capitalist class are not independent as were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interdependent parts of the same economic organism .
