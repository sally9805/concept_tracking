" Soldiers ' President " <P> Sirs : <P> Among some 4,000,000 ex-Service men , I have just received my quota of Bonus Bonds . I was rather surprised to notice Andrew Jackson 's picture used on these bonds . I presume the Treasury Department has some system of determining just whose picture is placed on different series of bonds , but did n't they overlook a splendid opportunity of showing Wartime President Wilson 's likeness on these Adjusted Service Bonds ? It seems to me that sentiment alone would have dictated the use of his picture - and also , was n't he a Democrat ? <P> The reason for using Jackson instead of Wilson should be newsworthy . <P> DESMOND J. FARRELL General Agent <P> The Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. of California San Antonio , Tex . <P> As a rule , the likeness of Thomas Jefferson is engraved on U. S. bonds of $50 denomination . Andrew Jackson 's image went on the Adjusted Service Bonds , said Secretary Morgenthau , because he was " a soldiers ' President .

No doubt your able correspondents covered well all sessions , but it is quite probable that they missed several interesting sidelights . <P> Cleveland cabdrivers expected a rich harvest in tips . They did n't mind the short hauls and being kept constantly busy ; they knew that the GOP was the rich men 's party and that all Republicans were living on hopes , after " three long years " of the New Deal . One jehu tells of a $2.95 trip and the outstretched hand for the nickel in change ! Another tells of hauling six and receiving a thin dime for a tip ! <P> The RKO Keith 's 105th Theatre , a neighborhood house , innocently caused many a laugh . A brilliant sign on the marquee read : " The Walking Dead-Welcome G. O. P. " <P> Ex-President Herbert Hoover buying pitcher after pitcher of foaming ale for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . <P> The much publicized and gushed-over , by sob sisters , Peggy Ann Landon , in a Cleveland restaurant famed for its good , high-powered beer . Wonder what bone-dry Kansans think of this ? <P> . . . The unsuccessful attempt of the Kansas delegation to act skittenish and " hale fellow " etc . <P> And the announcement by the Cleveland Convention Bureau that next year our fair city will be host to the Ohio Association of Cemetery Superintendents ! <P> M.
