Last of the great pre-Repeal gangsters left alive or at liberty is blank-faced , chicken-hearted Arthur ( " Dutch Schultz " ) Flegenheimer , onetime master of The Bronx beerage , reputed boss of the policy-game racket . " The cooler ai n't never so cold as the morgue , " quavered this pulpy nervous underworking last winter on giving himself up on a Federal charge of evading $92,103.34 in taxes on a 1929-31 income of $481,637.35 . At his trial in Syracuse , N. Y. last spring he got a hung jury . Last week in rural Malone , N. Y. <P> it began to look like another disagreement . <P> The jury had been out more than 27 hours when Federal District Judge Frederick H. Bryant returned from dinner at 8 p. m. , took his place on the bench . Just before 9 o'clock the jurors-eight farmers , a school superintendent , a storekeeper , a baker and a guide-shuffled into the box . <P> " Gentlemen , have you agreed upon a verdict ? " asked the court clerk . <P> " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant not guilty . " Judge Bryant jerked upright , a grey forelock falling over his wide , incredulous eyes . From the courtroom rose a shrill burst of female cheers . The judge banged his gavel , got quiet . Turning to the jury , he cried in a voice sharp with scorn : " You have labored long , and no doubt have given careful consideration to this case . Before I discharge you I will have to say that your verdict is such that shakes the confidence of law-abiding people in integrity and truth . <P> " It will be apparent to all who have followed the evidence in this case that you have reached a verdict based not on the evidence but on some other reason . <P> You will go home with the satisfaction , if it is a satisfaction , that you have rendered a blow against law enforcement and given aid and encouragement to the people who would flout the law . In all probability they will commend you . I can not . The clerk will give you your vouchers . " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their eyes on the floor .
