txt Will Rogers Offers a Way To Take Care of Interest To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Cal. , Dec. 2 . ? I have heard every kind of reason given for our hard times , and as causes of our slow recovery . But I have never heard the real one , that 's that interest Is too high . The world and about everybody in it are broke from paying too high interest . No man should receive more for the " hire " of his money than he could take it and earn with it himself , and for the last three years there has been nothing that he could have made even 1 per cent on it , outside-of loaning it . The banks all failed because the interest people owed ' em was larger than the principal . What would be the matter with banking on a real percentage of business ? The banker receives in interest in accordance to what the borrower makes on the loan . If he do n't make anything , he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for today . Be busy tomorrow reading wires from bankers . Yours , WILL ROGERS .
