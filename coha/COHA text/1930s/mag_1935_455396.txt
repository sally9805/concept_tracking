CUTE ALCOHOLISM was the way my commitment ' read , to which was added , when the doctors and the psychiatrists had checked me over : ? This was in the winter of 1933 , when friends succeeded just before Christmas in having me committed , through the New York courts , for treatment and possible cure , to one of the oldest and largest insane asylums in the East . They now call it a ' mental hospital , ' as all such places do ? but asylum is still what everybody knows it is , and it proved so truly an asylum for me that I have a friendly feeling for the good old word . I had asked for it . I mean I had asked for it literally , though I had not specified any particular sort of place . I had been begging , pleading , demanding toward ' the last , to be Incised up ? shut up ? chained up ? anything ! I had become a confirmed , habitual drunkard , without any of the stock alibis or excuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in the bank , and a pleasant home ; my work had been going well enough until the drink put an end to it and promised soon to put an end to me . Then I had tried to stop ? and could n't . I knew that I had already slipped past the point where any sanitarium , hospital , treatment , or environment which depended on my volitional cooperation could hold out any hope . I knew that I had lost my will with relation to alcohol . I knew that there was only left to me the wish ? which is entirely different from the will ? to be saved from my own weakness . At the suggestion of a friend I signed a court commitment , and the next day I was locked up in an institution so big and so universally known that its name is a vaudeville synonym for the sort of place it is . I was kept there for seven months . The treatment I underwent put no strain whatever on my drunkard 's honor or my drunkard 's will . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place as from Sing Sing , and , if I had escaped , the state police would have brought me back ? in handcuffs , if necessary . In July they let me out , with handshakes and some good-natured kidding , through the main gate . Incidentally , they seem to have cured me , which is as it may be . I hope they have , and I hope too that an honest account of my experience may be of some use . I was brought in late that December afternoon , polite , quiet , articulate , and able to walk without staggering , but drunk as a Bandusian goat . I had been drinking since seven that morning , even more conscientiously than usual , knowing it would be the last for a long while . My friends had not interfered . What difference did one last day make ? It was now about six o'clock , a couple of hours since I had had my last drink , and I was beginning to sink . When the first formalities were over and the attendants showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . That was probably the worst night I ever spent in my life . I wanted nothing so much as to be let alone . Instead , I was awakened at frequent intervals to be bathed , weighed , fed , have my temperature taken , and be put through all the rest of the elaborate routine which the rules required of every new arrival . All night long there was a steady procession of people in and out of my room . And the worst of it was that I could not shut them out . The door had no lock on it , and when I got up and closed the door it was opened again from the outside . It was against the rules to shut the door . I became more and more irritated . I began to think it had been a mistake to put me in precisely this sort of place . If I had to spend many nights like this , I 'd soon be raving and foaming at the mouth . By eight-thirty the next morning , when the doctor came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was so mad that for the time being I forgot all about being a drunkard ; I was so exhausted and stimulated by rage that I did not even miss my customary morning half-tumbler of Scotch . It could n't have been a deliberate part of their psychic therapy , but it worked that way . For months I had had a neurasthenic ? if not actually psychopathic ? agoraphobia , the diseased opposite of claustrophobia . I wanted to be shut up . I wanted to hide . I wanted to be by myself where people could n't break in on me . This was , in part , why I had wanted to be locked up , and why the suggestion of a modem insane asylum , though it surprised me , had been welcome . Even the thought of a padded cell had been welcome , promising seclusion and peace . I said as much to the doctor . He looked at me for a while without speaking , then finally grinned and said : ' Well , that 's a new one ? if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't precisely the accommodation you say you were looking for . The fact is that we have n't any cells , padded or otherwise . ' Look here , ' I burst out , ' I was n't kidding you , and I do n't know whether you are kidding me or not . I came here for seclusion . I came here to be locked up . I thought I had rented a nice quiet cell . And you stick me in a wide-open show window , in an illuminated dog kennel without any front , where people come walking in and out and prodding me with sticks every minute of the day and night . I spent a hell of a night . You ' ve got to find me a quiet room somewhere , where the door can be shut at night , for I tell you right now that , commitment or no commitment , if you think I 'm going to spend another night like last night ? ' Excuse me , ' he said , I must be going along . We 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our conversation had not been in undertones . A patient 1 was afterward to know as Spike ' sauntered over and offered me a cigarette . ' Say , fellow , ' he said , you 've got it all wrong . You do n't tell them . They tell you . ' II The place reminded me increasingly of my mother , who believed that by altering the name or appearance of a thing you could make the thing better . She was changing sauerkraut into liberty cabbage long before the sinking of the Lusitania . A skunk was a wood pussy , and hash became I-don'tremember-what by the addition of a sprig of parsley . This was not hypocrisy . It was her sincere if sornetimes naive contribution toward making the world happier and brighter . I had affectionately supposed her to be old-fashioned , but I now found the same system at work in this highly scientific , extremely modern institution . Take , for instance , the fiction that we were in a hospital . We all knew the sort of place we were in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes bitterly , yet always without embarrassment or pretense , ? but Spike soon cautioned me not to say nut college ' or ' booby hatch ' where any of the doctors or nurses might overhear it . He said it made them feel embarrassed . One of the first things I noticed was that they had tricked up the bars on the windows with my mother 's sprig of parsley . They were steel , and a gorilla could n't have bent them , but they ran in curls and curlicues , like the fancy decorations of a chateau looking out on a snow-covered park . If you bit one of the bars , it turned out to be a bar , just as the hash on my mother 's table always turned out to be hash when you put your teeth into it , but if you merely sat and looked at it , it looked like something else . The whole atmosphere of the place was camouflaged in the same kindly way . The nurse , attendants , orderlies in white coats , all said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel that you were an elegant guest in your own home , and you only discovered that all of them were experts in jiujitsu if and when you insisted on going to the mat ; so that life became a sort of parlor game , like charades or forfeits , and the rules were exactly the same whether you played it with the biggest doctors or the humblest little attendant . The game always began , ' My lord , the carriage waits . ' If that did n't work , they tried polite persuasion and coaxing . If you insisted , they threw you in . You always went . For instance , on that very first clay I was pol , tely invited to go ? and went ? to more places than I can enumerate . I had planned to spend at least a week in bed , or on a cot , tapering off maybe , reading detective stories . I had come here for rest and seclusion . I still had the idea of a nice quiet cell ' firmly fixed in my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putty in their hands . It was all part of the system prescribed for new patients . Late in the afternoon Mr. Dirk , the superintendent , came in to look me over . He asked if I should n't like to meet the other patients and be shown my seat in the dining room . I replied ? forgetting the rules of the charade ? that I should prefer to have my meals in bed for a week or so . He replied that it would be ever so much nicer to have my meals in the dining room , beginning right then . As a matter of fact , it was not bad , not like an insane asylum or a hospital either , but more like a club restaurant . There were small tables with flowers . The waiters and waitresses were Mr. Dirk himself , a couple of male nurses , and the nurse in charge of our hall , the beautiful Miss Pine . The guests were , as the French say , of an impeccable correctness . They were at case , conversed of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more olives . At my table were a professor of research histology , a railroad fireman , and a political lawyer . They seemed to have amiable interests in common , and drew rile into conversation . Except that the lawyer believed Harding was still President , while the railroad fireman thought we were on a boat , their conversation was lucid and casual . I felt awful , but not too awful yet . I managed to eat a little , and wondered if I were going to be kept awake all night again . When we arose from the table , I asked Mr. Dirk if anything had been done about my room . He said I was being moved to a bigger one , more quiet , around the corner of the corridor . We all gravitated into the lobby . During those first days , unless there was a white coat or uniform to go by , I found it practically impossible to guess which were patients and which were attendants . Even with the staff doctors , you simply had to learn their faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divinity among the patients , so that when you were introduced to a new ' doctor ' you never knew by the mere title which side of the fence he might be on . You had to suspend judgment and draw your OW/1 conclusions , which you could n't aliva.ys do . I was certain , however , about Dr. Hadden , the histologist , because I sat with him at dinner . He was now playing bridge . I pulled a chair over near him . He was dealing . He said hedid n't mind if I watched . He dealt himself a powerhouse , and could have made an original two-spade bid , forcing to game and perhaps to slam . He sorted his cards and passed listlessly . The other three passed , and the cards were thrown ha . I asked him in undertones why he had done it . I was seeing everything acutely with a sort of puzzled fascination , but was still in a sort of detached , hang-over haze . Because fate is against me , ' he whispered sadly . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will understand . ' Another benevolent elderly gentleman who had finished his evening paper asked me how I liked everything . When I told him , quite honestly , that I did n't yet know , he said he sincerely hoped I should be pleased , for he was sparing no expense ; it was now costing him nearly five million a year , and he proposed installing a large swimming pool after Christmas . The only noise in the big room came from a pinochle game between Miss Pine and the lawyer who thought Harding was still President . They laughed and were gay together . I watched it for a little while . The lawyer was cheating flagrantly , and Miss Pine , instead of objecting , simply cheated more flagrantly on the sly . The lawyer said to me , with a happy smile : ' You see , Miss Pine is the only person in the whole hospital who can give me a decent game . She can sometimes even beat me . The others play so poorly that I always beat them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bottom . ' He chuckled , Miss Pine melded four queens , and a gentleman asked me if I had read Anthony Adverse . His question made me realize that , despite the strange fascination this new world had for me , I was in some curious way vaguely bored , vaguely disappointed . deleted material rolling back and forth would pull them smoother and tighter . Over and over again they swathed me , until at last they stood off to smooth out the wrinkles and look at it and see if it was all right . I was flat on my back . Except that my head stuck out and lay comfortably on a pillow , I was like the mummy of Rameses . I could n't bend my elbows or knees . I could n't even double my fists . My hands were pressed fiat . I could n't move a muscle except by telegraphing a deliberate local order . This was the famous pack . ' It was tighter than any kid glove . And the tightness was so uniform that it did n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently , and had fixed an ice pack on the top of my head where the skull was thickest . They had turned out all the lights , but left the door slightly ajar , and told me that they 'd be down the hall somewhere so that if anything went wrong I could let out a yell . I lay there in the darkness like an Egyptian mummy . Pretty soon my mind began to work , and I discovered that I liked it . It occurred to me that probably I was masochistic or something of the sort . I set about rationalizing it , as one always does . I remembered the theory that we all have a subconscious longing to be back in the womb ? that we remember subconsciously how nice and safe and warm it was . I remembered poetry about the womb and the grave . There were some distant , ordinary , living , human sounds way down the corridor somewhere , but they did n't disturb or concern me . Perhaps they did disturb me , for I became acutely conscious again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to toss about in the bed . I wanted to put my elbow up under the pillow . I wanted to move my arms . I wanted to scratch any forehead . I 'd have to yell for help if a fly alighted on my nose . In a little while the active nervousness decreased , but I was conscious of increasing tension . I tried experimentally to break or stretch my bonds , by contracting and straining every muscle . I found that I could n't loosen them at all , and it was this that had made me like it . I went lax presently , and began to sweat . I sweated , time passed , and the tension was gone ; the jangling nervousness disappeared , too , fading slowly as it does under a strong soporific . I was soon as peaceful as an unborn babe . When they came back after a long time and began to unwind me , I was still peaceful . And when they went away I turned on my side , stuck my arm up under my head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to bed that way for five or six successive nights , and then Dr. Paschall ordered it stopped . He said I liked it too well ? that it could get to be another habit , like dope , veronal , or whiskey , and advised me to read La S ? questre'e de Poitiers . Iv Toward the end of a week they began to merge me into the group , to cog me in with the machinery of Hall Four . I mean , special things stopped happening to me ; they stopped shunting and dragging me around for special examinations , treatments , wrappings , tappings ; they began to make me do the same things everybody else did . They enrolled me in the kindergarten , took me for walks with the rest of the class , gave me work to do and things to play with . The numbers of the halls were arbitrary . A new patient went automatically to Hall Four , the observation ward ; if he was violent he was sent to Eight or Nine ; if he stayed there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was calmed , or nearly cured , he went to Hall Two . The female patients , I learned , were under the same roof , but way over in an entirely different set of halls , nearly a quarter of a mile away . Some of them , I was told , were ' good-lookers , ' and I 'd soon see them all , or most of them , at church or at the movies . At that time there were fourteen of us in Hall Four . We had to stay there until the doctors made up their minds where each of us should subsequently be quartered . We might be sent to one of the howling back halls under constant surveillance , or to one of the ' villas ' where patients had almost as much freedom as in a summer boarding house or sanitarium-hotel . At this point there is something I had better try to explain if the general picture is to make sense . I was an alcoholic , but I was not now , or at any time thereafter , put with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different basis . For example , take the fourteen of us who were quartered in this intermediate hall . Our ailments were quite dissimilar , just as ailments are in a surgical ward or in the accident ward of a regular hospital , where one man has appendicitis and another hernia or mastoiditis ; where one has broken his arm falling off a ladder , while the man in the next bed has been slashed in a fight or cracked on the head in an automobile smashup . So it was here . One of us had melancholia , another suffered from hallucinations ; so-and-so was elated , another was manic-depressive ; still another , who seemed completely sane , was with us solely bemuse he had occasional Uncontrollable impulses to jump out of high windows or in front of motor buses . Our only similarity was that our various ailments were in the stage which made the tempo of this hall the right one temporarily for our treatment and observation . I was the only alcoholic in the group . There were few alcoholics , indeed , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred patients . As a matter of fact , while the institution accepts pa tients in this category and sometimes cures them , it is not very eager to take them . The authorities do n't like to accept cases they may not be able to cure , and , contrary to some impressions , the whiskey habit is harder to cure than the general run of ordinary mental derangements . While our ailments were dissimilar , as I say , there was one respect in which we were all alike ? one thing which differentiated us from people on the outside , and made it expedient for us to be locked up . I figured it out for myself . It checked on all of us . It negated , incidentally , the Pirandelloish notion , widely prevalent , that ' if the truth were known ' nine tenths of all the people of your acquaintance , including perhaps yourself , are ' outside ' only because they have n't been tagged , ' as it were . My friend , Professor who has an international reputation as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities , confessed that he always felt a sense of embarrassment , of furtiveness , of guilt , when he came to see me . He was afraid , he said , they 'd find out ' and keep him there . That notion , which I used to have myself , is wrong , and I can prove it . I can prove it by the one criterion that clicked , checked , on all of us locked up in there , and that would not check on the professor or any of the rest of you who are going about your business free on the outside . V Take Hauser , our youngest , a favorite in the hall , a brilliant , amusing , chap ? up to a certain point . He was elated . ' He sparkled . He had finished , precociously , his academic course at Princeton with honors , including the Phi Beta Kappa key , at nineteen , and was headed toward the medical school when his father , who was a doctor , had sent him here to the ' nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The difference between him and Bench-ley was that Benchley controlled the stuff , Benchley rode it ; Hauser could n't control it . He did it whether he wanted to or not . He did it when he did n't want to . It rode him . Take my morose friend , Papa Renwick . He was the diametric opposite of Hauser . He was so melancholy that he wanted to die . Lots of people on the outside are so melancholy that they want to die . But they control it . They do n't try several times to jump out windows , as Papa Renwick had done . He could n't control it . Take young Frainer . His case was a queer one . He is cured now , I 've heard ; but it took longer to cure him than it did some who were brought in howling or imagining they were ancient emperors . Yet he seemed to have absolutely nothing the matter with him except that he was a pain in the neck to everybody and seemed to need a good clout on the jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him . He had a head like Byron or Apollo , and the sort of nip-waisted , long-limbed , flat-flanked , beautifully shouldered body that made any clothes he put on look as if they had come from the Prince of Wales 's private tailor . He had an authentic Boston Back Bay accent which made even Miss Pine and the doctors feel inferior , and the manners of Lord Chesterfield . On top of this , he had an aggressive superciliousness and selfishness which were painful and astounding , as when he let the crate of fruit his family sent him rot rather than give any of us an orange . There was nothing else mental , or moral , the matter with him . But this one thing had been enough . His unpopularity , to use a mild word for it , in the outside world had become universal . He had been asked to leave a succession of banks and brokerage offices in which his influential family had placed him ; his fiancee had thrown him over in disgust ; servants , waiters , taxi drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no young women , or men either , of his own set could abide him . His parents , even his mother , had the extraordinary sense to see that the fault was with him , and that if he were n't cured of it life would junk him . Honest medical psychologists consulted by his parents had guessed that the real young man , underneath his unfortunate outer shell , was a sweet-natured , rather timid , decent chap , but that it would take a year or more in some psychiatric institution to break through the overlay and cure him . So here he was in our midst . Why ? Not because he was supercilious and super-selfish . You know plenty of people like that who are often successful , if not beloved . They use it as armor and as a weapon ; using it , they control it . But this poor fellow had it as a disease , like jaundice or measles ; he could n't control it . Then there was Professor Jeffries , the mathematician . His mind raced . He played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Controlling the clutter , he had been a brilliant teacher and a ' lightning calculator ' as well , using this latter freakish talent merely to amuse himself or his friends , since he did n't have to commercialize it . Now he had lost control of it ; it controlled him . He was harmless , but had to be watched all the time . Undressed for bed and in his pajamas , he forgot one night to get into the bed , and when the night watchman 's light flashed through the open door hours later he was standing absorbed in the middle of the room . His racing mathematical mind , controlled , had been in a fair way to make him famous ; uncontrolled , it had put him here . So take me now , in turn , as a case like the others . For many years pmvious I had been drinking , sometimes a lot , when I wanted to , getting tight intentionally and liking it , sobering up when I wanted to or thought I ought to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . I know plenty of good citizens , business men , artists , writers , who not only go in heavily for highballs and cocktails , but get drunk as a boiled owl whenever they choose ? and who nevertheless , year after year , keep their health and balance , do their work , turn out a distinguished product in good volume . I know now that getting drunk frequently , being fuddled and muddled half the time , lying down to sleep at parties , being put to bed by the taxi driver or fighting with policemen , is not being a drunkard . So long as any man drinks when he wants to and stops when he wants to he is n't a drunkard , no matter how much he drinks or how often he falls under the table . The British upper classes were constantly and consistently mildly tipsy , from father to son , in Parliament and Pall Mall , for nearly the whole of the eighteenth century . It is n't drinking that makes a drunkard . I had drunk for years , enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something snapped in me , and I lost control . I began to have to have the stuff when I did n't want it . I could n't stop when I wanted to . I was n't here because I drank a lot , or too much . I was here , just like the rest , because I had lost control . I insist on this common denominator . I insist that it clicks . Melancholia , higher mathematics , drink , had n't put any of us here . Loss of control had put us all here . Of course there were others of us whose loss of control was more diffuse , less easy to define ? the paranoiacs , schizophrenics , catatonics , the ones who had elaborate hallucinations , the manic-depressives , and my later friend , Charlie Logan , the human barometer , who howled like a wolf whenever the weather was changing . Despite the common denominator , eve had a kaleidoscopic divergence of cases . So here I was , an inmate of this extraordinary locked-and-barred kindergarten , for the same good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , most of us mature , who had lost control of ourselves in one way or another and who had to be controlled by others ? that is , treated like children and put back in the nursery . VI The longer I stayed in the asylum , the more I saw and experienced , the more it seemed to me , often fantastically , to be a kindergarten . Despite court commitments , despite bars and huskies , it was inure like a nursery than a prison . We were handled as children ? not as delinquent or bad children , necessarily , but rather as potentially decent , irresponsible children who did not know , hat was good for us , and therefore frequently had to be told . It was an atmosphere of ' Mamma knows best ' or ' Teacher knows best , ' protective and generally kindly , but backed up with ' Mamma will spank ' when the children became unmanageable and had to be dragged kicking to bed without their supper . What gave it sometimes a crazy-dream quality ? quite apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that all of us were grown men , many of us middle-aged or elderly , of the type that generally bosses and orders other people around in the outside world . To the casual eye we were responsible , mature , none of us physical invalids . When our nurse , Miss Pine , took us to walk , we looked like a delegation of prominent Rotarians . We rambled about a good deal , both in the buildings and in the snow-covered park , nearly always in sole charge of Miss Pine . We grown men went to play in the snow in charge of a young girl in nurse 's uniform who scolded us if we forgot our rubbers and told us when we had to go back indoors . Sometimes one of the huskies was off somewhere in the background when we went out , but usually not . When we returned , Miss Pine saw to it that we put on dry socks before going to supper if we had got our feet wet , and made the political lawyer eat all his spinach before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tools us to the barbershop , through the long corridors , unlocking the doors , counting us , and bringing up the rear . Often there was something sad , almost sinister , about that special procession . We usually walked single file , not that there was any rule about it , but in the long , bare connecting corridors there was a narrow strip ? a ' runner , ' I believe it is called ? and we got the habit of walking single file on it . Not all the patients were always cheerful , and early morning is never a very gay time in any sort of institution , so that often most of us walked silently with our heads down . I was a part of it myself , yet I could see it . One of the depressed ones , leaving months later , cured , told me that he remembered those walks to the barbershop as the most horrible experience of his life . Back in December , the time of which I am now writing , one could never have guessed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked with the rest of us like an automaton . We all , as well as Miss Pine , looked after him a little ? prevented him from walking on in a straight line when there was a corner to turn , made him sit down when it was time to sit down . He seemed as oblivious as a robot . Yet he told me afterward that those walks to the barbershop had always filled him with horror . He had believed then , he said , that he would walk in a line of men like that , somewhere , silent and single file , all the rest of his life . But such things were the secret undertones . On the whole we were a cheerful kindergarten and liked our pretty teacher . We talked about it sometimes among ourselves . No responsibilities , no obligations , no problems to meet or solve , no duties or decisions . We did n't even have to decide when to get up in the morning or when to go to bed . Somebody else looked after us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes of my childhood , when fond recollection presents them to view ! ' Backward , turn backward , 0 Time , in your flight ! Make me a child again , just for to-night ! ' During the war I heard bearded Frenchmen sobbing , Woman , maman , moment ' and once I heard a man bleat it standing on a wooden platform just before the sheriff sprung the trap . When life gets too much for us , we want to go back . Life had got too much for us . That 's why we were back in a nursery . VII Divine service was held every Sunday afternoon from two-thirty to three-thirty , ? it had to be in the afternoon because they hired a regular preacher and small choir from outside , ? and we mostly attended to look at the women patients , as the women patients attended to look at us . The first day I went along , Miss Pine piloted our Hall Four delegation . The pews were already two-thirds filled when we reached the chapel , and I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material too were Joan of Are and Ben-Hur . The choice of films lay with a woman doctor of the staff who seemed to have a theory that photoplays starring domestic animals were particularly soothing to the insane . Over and over again the hero was a horse , when it was n't Rintin-tin or a Terhune collie . An exception to this rule occurred in December , when she presented Katharine Hepburn in Little Women , and thereby caused a riot . The riot broke out at the point in the picture where the little women gave away their breakfast . If you recall it , the dear little girls had been up since daybreak helping mamma , and had just sat down to a pretty breakfast table with steaming coffee , waffles , honey , and other delightful dishes , when Miss Hepburn conceived the bright idea of giving the whole breakfast , coffeepot and all , to a poorer family next door . As the younger sisters danced around with delight , denuding the table , a girl over in the darkness among the women patients cried : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cup of coffee first , or I 'd pour the whole pot down her neck ! The idea ! ' Spike , who was sitting near me , shouted back : ' You said it , sister ! ' Before the hubbub became general and the lights went up , another pa-tient , a dear old major from Virginia , roared out : If I had a bunch of daugh-ters like that , I 'd put ' em in a ! ' For shame ! ' cried an old lady patient . ' It was beautiful . It was unselfish ! It was ? ' It was too damned unselfish ! ' somebody else shouted , and then in less loud voices we began a free-for-all debate , in whirls the consensus of opinion seemed to be that it was too much . Luncheon ? Sure ! Dinner , maybe . But breakfast ! It was n't human . We felt we had been outraged , and continued the argument until we were packed off to bed . Thereafter our heroes and heroines were quadrupeds . They were sometimes beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never their morning oats . VIII When Christmas of 1933 came round , we celebrated with a Christmas tree ; we ate turkey and plum pudding ; but what keyed the day , supplied its chief tone , was the inundation of visitors . All of us had at least one visitor ; some had several . Most of them were familiar faces that came every Wednesday or Friday , but that day there were extra aunts , cousins , married daughters , remoter connections or friends who had come from a long distance , some of them for the first time . It was always interesting to study visitors who came inside our locked precincts for the first time . They usually regarded their own patient as a normal invalid , as it were , but all the rest of us with dubious misgivings . They wanted to hurry through our corridors , smoking room , public reception hall , to the privacy of their own patient 's bedroom , where they were forced to leave the door open , but conversed in low tones . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have one of their ' dear ones ' shut up in it . They all had the same psychology the first time . But reversals of attitude on the part of our visitors ? initial terror and subsequent reassurance ? were sometimes striking . I recall one case that was like a little Ibsen drama . When I had been in Hall Four some weeks , a new patient by the name of Kingston arrived . He was a pleasant little man with sandy hair , about forty-five years old , with a dryly humorous mouth that had a kindly twist to it . What might be the matter with him was a mystery , ? I mean to us
