txt Complete agreement on a compromise Tax Bill was reached by the Senate and House conferees late today , and leaders considered that the path was clear for adjournment of the Seventy-fourth Congress on Saturday . Plans were made to clear up odds and ends of legislation in both houses tomorrow while the final draft of the Tax Bill is being prepared , and to rush the revenue measure through both branches on Saturday , even if a late night session is needed . Chairman Doughton of the Ways and Means Committee said that every effort would be made to get the bill to the Senate and House tomorrow . This would be done , he said , because under the rules a single objection can force a bill to be carried over . By bringing in the bill on Friday any objection that might be made would simply postpone consideration for that day and enable both houses to consider the measure on Saturday . Deficiency Bill Put Through Legislative action was completed on the Deficiency Bill , which includes $1,425,000,000 to continue work relief for the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the House passed yesterday . The measure was sent to the White House , leaving only the Tax Bill as required business to be transacted before adjournment sine die . The tax conferees reached their agreement after ten days of discussion . The final compromise was considered to follow fairly closely , the suggestions of President Roosevelt 's tax message of last April . The Senate conferees succeeded in guarding the principle of flat normal income taxes on corporations , but Mr. Roosevelt 's suggestion of high levies on undistributed profits of corporations was superimposed on the normal income rates , at the insistence of the House conferees . The conferees decided upon a graduated levy of 7 to 27 per cent on undivided corporate profits , with a corporaton income tax graduated from 8 per cent on the first $2,000 to 15 per cent on all in excess of $40,000 . Exemption of dividend receipts from the individual normal income tax would be withdrawn . First Year 's Probable Yield Hasty estimates of the bill 's probable yield during the next year , made by fiscal experts without an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the conferees , fixed its total addition , to the Federal income at about $785,000,000 , made up as follows : . Yield . Item . Corporation taxes - $630,000,000 Windfall taxes 82,000,000 Liquidation of holding 33,000,000 companies Excise taxes on certain imports 10,000,000 Foreign corporations 10,000,000 Irrevocable trusts ( tightening certain loopholes ) . 20,000,000 Total $785,000,000 Conferees on both sides expressed themselves as satisfied with the compromise bill from the point of view of revenue . Asked if the administration would approve the measure , Chairman Doughton of the Ways and Means Committee replied , with a smile : " I certainly think so , do n't you ? " Representatives Vinson of Kentucky and Cooper of Tennessee , two of the House conferees , said that the compromise would provide more permanent revenue than the original bill passed by the House . They pointed out that only the windfall taxes would tend to fall off after the first year of operation , so that the rest of the revenue could be maintained for the Treasury as long as needed . As to Small Corporations As a concession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a provision that a firm would pay 7 per cent either on the first 10 per cent of its retained net adjusted income or on the first $5,000 of retained net adjusted income , whichever figure was larger . Without this exemption , small corporations would have had to pay as high as 27 per cent in the event that it elected to retain all of their profits as surplus . In view of the revenue yield of the corporation taxation features agreed upon , the Senate conferees consented to drop the Senate increase on individual surtaxes , amounting to a rise of 1 per cent in the rate of each of the brackets ' from $6,000 to $50,000 . They also agreed to the elimination of the Lonergan amendment , which would have exempted from inclusion in the net value of an estate insurance policies taken out expressly for the purpose of paying estate taxes . Banks and insurance companies would be exempted from the undistributed profits tax and would pay ' at the flat 15 per cent income tax rate . Intercorporate dividends , now exempted up to 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . The present jewelry tax would be repealed and the fur tax would be lowered from 10 to 3 per cent , but exemptions would be changed in the interest of simplified administration so that the yield would be the same as now  --  about $2,400,000 . Walsh and George Dissent Because they were unable to accept the provisions imposing graduated supertaxes on the undistributed earnings of corporations , Senators Walsh and George announced they would dissent from the conference report and later would file a minority report . The Senators announced , however , they would sign the conference report " in order that it may be presented to the House and Senate with their objections . " A statement issued by the Senators said : " While there has been some evidence of a small number of corporations postponing or delaying distribution of earnings to protect a limited number of taxpayers from paying higher individual taxes , in our opinion the overwhelming evidence presented was to the effect that the imposition of heavy surtaxes on the undistributed earnings or surpluses of corporations would be detrimental to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sane and prudent judgment exercised by most business concerns in maintaining surpluses of reasonable proportions should be encouraged and not discouraged , for ultimately the government received taxes , which are certain to increase in the future , upon all surpluses through increases in the value of the stocks and bonds of such corporations and through large inheritance and estate taxes , when the owners die . " This provision of the Tax Bill was both discriminatory and injurious toward the various classes of business . Businesses that now have large surpluses and no debts are distinctly favored . Businesses that are in debt and financially weak will be further weakened and in times of adversity or depression rapidly extinguished . " The bill will operate to substitute , through tax pressure , bureaucratic judgment Instead of ownership direction and judgment as to what is the sound , prudent and financially wise policy necessary for steady employment and general prosperity . " The creation of new corporations and the expansion of present ones is discouraged and financially strong corporations are given decidedly competitive advantage . " Both the Senate and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , trying to clear the decks for quick action Saturday on the Tax Bill . According to present plans , no other business will receive any great consideration on Saturday , in the midst of the rush for adjournment . In its final action on the deficiency measure the Senate adopted the conference report on the bill , receding from its stand on the Florida ship canal . The House yesterday refused to accept a Senate amendment providing for the expenditure of $10,000,000 of the relief appropriation on the canal , upon approval of the project by an impartial board of engineers . The bill , as it passed , carries a total of $2,375,281,000 , the most important fund being the relief appropriation . It provided for the expenditure of $300,000,000 by the Public Works Administration in grants to cities . Control of the work relief funds was centered in the President . Allocations were forbidden unless enough money was allocated to finish a project . Ship Subsidy Bill Advanced Pushing forward toward adjournment , the Senate advanced the Guffey-Copeland-Gibson bill to substitute a system of graduated operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail contracts , to the point where an agreement was reached to vote on it at 1 P. M. tomorrow . The Senate will meet at 11 A. M. to discuss the bill . A widely different bill has passed the House , but the conference is not expected to delay adjournment . Before and during debate on the Ship Subsidies Bill , the Senate passed a number of minor bills by unanimous consent and adopted conference reports on the Interior and District of Columbia Appropriation Bills . The Senate also confirmed the nominations of Robert E. Healy as a Securities and Exchange Commissioner , and Fernandez Garcia as Attorney General of Puerto Rico . Senator Wagner was pressing for favorable action on his bill for Federal aid in , slum clearance and low- cost housing , but it appeared doomed in a reluctant House committee unless the White House displays stronger interest than it has as yet . Nerves of the leaders were ragged when the House recessed at 6 o'clock to reconvene for a night session , when debate began on the Walsh-Healey bill which forbids child and convict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government contracts . Debate on the bill was concluded , placing it in position for a vote at 11 A. M. The only change made was in the clause applying to employment of minors . An amendment making it legal to employ boys of 16 years old or over , instead of 18 as originally provided , was approved . The House completed action on the Treasury-Postoffice Appropriation Bill , sending it to the Senate for concurrence in the conference report , which is expected tomorrow . As approved , the bill carries $992 , - 594,892 . The $26,500,000 for ocean mail contracts which the Senate eliminated from the House bill was restored . The House originally approved $9,450,000 for all mail . contracts other than ocean mall , and the Senate added $5,350,000 more to bring the total to $14,800,000 . The conference report compromises on $9,717 , - 500 , the increase above the original House allotment being for the establishment of two new Central American routes . The afternoon tension was the result of a three-man filibuster by Representatives Marcantonio , Boileau and O'Malley against several Immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special rule . Despite the filibuster , the bills were passed , although there was little hope the Senate would act during the rest of this week . The first bill provided Apr the repatriation of native-born married women who lost citizenship through marriage prior to Sept. 22 , 1922 . While citizenship rights were restored to those whose marriage status has since changed , they must take the oath of allegiance before claiming rights as citizens . The bill had passed the Senate . The bill providing for the deportation of aliens who disseminate propaganda from foreign sources caused the greatest fight by the little band , but it was passed by a standing vote of 172 to 22 . The opponents argued that the powers conferred upon the Secretary of Labor were too bread , and that re- ligious and political speakers visiting the United States could be deported . Another bill approved by a voice vote was one providing for the return to their homeland of all aliens who fall into distress or need public aid . A bill to protect American actors , musicians and opera singers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice vote without objection . The number of alien artists permitted to enter in any one year would be limited to the number of American artists permitted to enter the corresponding foreign countries in that same period for professional engagements .
