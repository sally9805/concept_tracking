The American College of Surgeons met at Philadelphia last week and pithily discussed professorial problems . <P> Ignorant Public . " The Public is more ignorant about medicine than any other science . " - Dr . Charles Horace Mayo , Rochester , Minn. , who , like his older brother Dr. William James Mayo ( also at this meeting ) , always makes arresting remarks at conventions . <P> Laggard Brains . " Is there any use of making it possible for a man to live to be go , if his brain dies at the age of 70 ? . . . <P> Until we teach them and educate them how to live so that their brains will continue to function for the years added to the bodies ' life , there is little use in increasing the life span . " - Dr . Mayo . <P> Practical Education . " From $7,000 to $10,000 is necessary to enter the practice of medicine . From the first day the student enters medical college he should come into contact with clinical medicine . <P> Perhaps the time will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general practitioners , who will not be taught the minutiae of the theories and methods they will not use when they are in practice , but will be trained to observe the results of skilled examinations by others , especially those using laboratory methods , and to correlate them . " - Dr . William James Mayo . <P> Pernicious Cinema . Movie pictures of operations have been lauded as a means of instruction . But , " the cinematograph is a dangerous method if it is offered in place of the more laborious method , where the learner comes into direct contact with the patient . For the post-graduate teaching it may prove useful . " - Professor George Grey Turner , Royal College of Surgeons , Newcastle-upon-Tyne , John B. <P> Murphy Memorial Orator . <P> Electro-Surgery , the use of a cauterizing knife , is as far ahead of scalpel surgery " as the modern electric tram is ahead of the lumbering horse car . " - Dr . Howard Atwood Kelly , Baltimore . It permits elegant excision of cancer ramifications and delicate areas of the brain . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckner Kanavel , Chicago , pointed out that coagulation caused by the cautery is more likely to scatter malignant growths than to retard or destroy them . <P> Cancer eradication requires , in the first instance , five or six great research institutions , each costing at least $10,000,000 , established at strategic points throughout the U. S.-Dr . James Ewing , Manhattan . <P> Bronchiectasis , dilatation and inflammation of the bronchial walls , is the unsuspected cause of 95% of all " bronchitis " cases. - Dr . Edward William Alton Ochsner , New Orleans . Dr. Ochsner has not yet placated Governor Huey Pearce Long of Louisiana , who ousted the able young surgeon from his post in New Orleans ' Charity Hospital ( TIME , Oct. 6 ) . <P> Surgical Threads . Manufacturers of braided silk and catgut used in sewing up wounds heretofore have tested their threads five or six days to detect any latent germs . Henceforth , to satisfy fellows of the College of Surgeons , surgical threads must undergo 13 days ' test-this the suggestion of Dr. Frank Lamont Meleney , Manhattan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
