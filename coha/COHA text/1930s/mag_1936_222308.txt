Everyone who listens to John Charles Thomas when he sings over the radio knows him for the resonant " Good Night , Mother , " with which he ends all his programs . On such occasions Baritone Thomas is addressing a homey , kindly-faced old lady who lives in the house he bought for her in Towson , Md. , tends her garden , mows her own lawn , harks back constantly to the days when her John was a lad singing in the churches where his Methodist father preached . <P> Federal law prohibits the exchange of person-to-person radio messages in the course of a public broadcast . A Pittsburgh newshawk confronted Baritone Thomas with this solid legal fact when he sang there last week , asked him what he would do if his filial salutation should be banned from the air by the Federal Communications Commission . John Charles Thomas ' reply was unhesitating : " It will be either ' Good Night , Mother , ' or ' Goodbye Broadcasting . ' ' ' <P> Chances are that FCC will not force the issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Baritone Thomas has completed his year 's contract with William R. Warner &; Co . ( Vince Mouthwash ) , is about to take a vacation . When he appeared on the Golden Rule Mother 's Day program in Baltimore last Sunday there was no excuse for him to clash with FCC .
