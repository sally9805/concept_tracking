txt The Bus Peril I wonder whether we must have a few deaths before something is done to see that buses are manned by conductors as well as drivers . Two of my acquaintances , both women , have been severely hurt recently by doors closing on them while dismounting . This evening , between . 5:30 and 6 , when a friend was dismounting at Fifty-fourth Street and Lexington Avenue from a northbound bus , No. 282 , the doors closed on her , throwing her full-length on the street , bruising and shaking her and scattering her parcels . A man dismounted from the bus ' to help her , but all the driver could do was yell , " Let 's get going ! " and start the vehicle . The buses are often overcrowded , uncomfortable , start and stop suddenly , so that passengers are thrown about , and are far from an improvement on the old trolleys . MICHAEL FLAGG .
