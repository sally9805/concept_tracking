Saved from Embarrassment <P> Sirs : <P> You may be glad to know that a recent article in TIME proved timely indeed to the Walt Disney Studio and saved us from considerable embarrassment . <P> The article ( TIME , Dec. 12 ) described a Brooklyn divorce trial where the most important testimony concerned a gesture made by raising the hands to the forehead , extending the fingers like horns , and making an ugly face . <P> I was horrified to learn that this gesture , called cornuto , is a well-known symbol for cuckoldry in Latin countries-horrified because I had in my ignorance and innocence used the identical gesture as a gag in a forthcoming Donald Duck picture , The Hockey Champ . <P> I planned a scene where Donald emerges from a snowbank with icicles sticking on his head like horns . His three little nephews mock his appearance by making the " horns " gesture at him . <P> This gag got by every one in the Studio , who apparently knew as little about cornuto as I did , and would have appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needless to say , if this had happened , the film would have got loud , unwanted laughs in Mexico , South America and Italy and would have aroused the censors . We passed the information along to the Hays office , incidentally , and they were very glad to have it . <P> I enclose a sketch of Donald 's nephews as they very nearly appeared on the screen . <P> HARRY REEVES Story Department Walt Disney Productions , Ltd .
