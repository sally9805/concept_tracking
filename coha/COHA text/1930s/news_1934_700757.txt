Officials said they did not look for wheat to be on the suspension list . Autimrities at the Department of Agriculture said they were negotiating with Canadians for 800,000 bushels of durum wheat to be used for seed and that they expected the full duty to be paid on this and other wheat brought in from the Dominion . In addition to bringing in foreign supplies , the administration intends to garner all available feed in this country . To that end , even corn stalks ordinarily left in the fields are to be used . Gleaners will go over stubble to gather grain and feed left as food for birds in normal years . Stunted corn which the farmers feel not worth saving will be harvested with labor from relief In some instances , State relief administrations may buy crops out right and gather them with relief workers . Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who returned today from a six-weeks ' trip through Midwest and Far West said : " I believe we can do more than we are doing for drought-stricken farmers in conserving and utilizing all livestock feed , and we are doing everything we can think of otherwise for them .

In buying drought-menaced animals which can not be fed or watered by their owners , the government is culling out the less desirable animals . This culling , they say , will be worth millions of dollars to the livestock industry of the future and will leave it in the best position in history . Of the 10,000,000 cattle and 5,000 , - 000 sheep and goats to be bought , most will be slaughtered and converted into meat products immediately after buying . Some will be shipped to southern pastures to be fattened for slaughter , and the rest will be shipped to " deficit areas " for rehabilitation uses . Six months ago the AAA said the beef cattle population of 67,000,000 was about 17,000,000 above normal .
