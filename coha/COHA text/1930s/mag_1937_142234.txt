In a city of shining hills and seagirt promontories , the nation 's most spectacular publisher last week celebrated the birth of his business . It was 50 years since William Randolph Hearst was given the San Francisco Examiner by his father , rich old Senator George Hearst . To mark the anniversary , the first publishing property of the Hearst enterprises ran off a 134-page edition of 306,000 copies . One of its most striking features was a letter , written by " Will " Hearst , 24 and recently rusticated from Harvard , to tell his father what he would do if he had the Examiner to play with. * <P> " Now if you should make over to me the Examiner-with enough money to carry out my schemes . ... It would be well to make the paper as far as possible original . . . . To imitate only some such leading journal as the New York World which is undoubtedly the best paper of that class to which the Examiner belongs - that class which appeals to the people and which depends for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not upon the wisdom of its political opinions or the lofty style of its editorials . . . Illustrations attract the eye and stimulate the imagination of the masses and materially aid the comprehension of an unaccustomed reader and thus are of particular importance to that class of people which the Examiner claims to address . . . . " <P> With this letter William Randolph Hearst drew a bead on his audience which has not wavered in 50 years of " Gee Whiz ! " journalism . Eight years later , with the Examiner going strong , the first big battle by Hearst for his publishing empire was fought in Manhattan . He grappled for an Eastern footing with Joseph Pulitzer and his old model , Pulitzer 's sensational World . Gentle Mrs. Phoebe Apperson Hearst , whose fortune was always at her beloved son 's disposal , sold her Anaconda copper shares for $7,500,000 to finance this New York struggle . But it was in San Francisco that Hearst first proved his genius for mass publishing and of that genius last week 's anniversary Examiner rehearsed dazzling examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great news story with which in days gone by it had roused San Franciscans : the mysterious Nob Hill haunted house scare ( 1888 ) , the City Hall building fraud of 1891 ; the visit of Strong Man Eugene Sandow in 1894 when the blond Hercules separately moved each &; every muscle of his body ; the horrid " Belfry Murders " - two young women church workers , one chopped up , one strangled and stowed in a steeple ( 1895 ) ; the kidnapping and torture of aged Sugar Planter James Campbell in 1896.
