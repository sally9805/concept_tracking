Taking his ease on a cottage porch near Hendersonville , N. C. , one day last week , sat tanned , lanky Rt . Rev. Henry St. George Tucker , Presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church . An automobile drove up . " Ablewhite ! " cried Bishop Tucker . " I 'm glad to see you . Come on in . " He shook the hand of a dusty , weary , baldish man-Rt . Rev. Hayward Seller Ablewhite , Bishop of Northern Michigan , resigned . From a retreat in Gambier , Ohio , Bishop Ablewhite , his name beclouded in the press , had furiously driven 600 miles to beg the aid of his superior . The two sat down to talk . <P> Bishop Ablewhite resigned last March , when shortages of some $99,000 were discovered in the funds of his diocese . Ordinarily , the matter would not have been discussed until the bishop 's resignation came before the Episcopal House of Bishops , at its meeting next November . But last month two Michigan laymen brought suit against the bishop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . And last week the Chicago Tribune splashed out stories picturing 51-year-old Bishop Ablewhite as a worldly prelate , a drinker of Scotch whiskey and champagne . <P> Bishop Ablewhite had , according to the Tribune , discovered shortages in diocesan funds soon after his consecration in 1930 . One fund , which had shrunk from $40,000 to $30,000 was in the bishop 's discretion to invest as he liked , and use for good works of any kind . In an attempt to recoup the losses , the bishop became involved with a promoter , one Harry S. Lyons , who called himself a onetime Navy captain . For a time Lyons made money for Bishop Ablewhite , and during these palmy days the two , sometimes with their wives , frequented Chicago nightspots . Finally , said the bishop , Lyons skipped out in 1935 , taking with him a reported $250,000 , including the $30,000 in diocesan money . Bishop Ablewhite believes that Lyons died last summer in Florida . <P> Soon as the Tribune had its story ready , it got a statement from the bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me as though my sole friends are publicans and sinners . That is , I am proud to say , true ! I have no friends so self-respecting that they are in need of no repentance . . . . Why whisper and use . . . innuendo ! Why not be forthright and say , as I frankly say ... that Mrs. Ablewhite and I have been at the Chez Paree , which we have enjoyed , and to other restaurants where shows have been as good or not as good . It is no crime to eat and drink for enjoyment . . . . " As for the diocesan finances , Bishop Ablewhite said he could reveal nothing until Bishop Tucker felt ready to release a formal statement which the Michigan bishop had sent him . After Bishop Ablewhite 's hasty trip south , Bishop Tucker gave reporters a statement which upheld Bishop Ablewhite 's personal honesty , cast some doubt on his judgment .
