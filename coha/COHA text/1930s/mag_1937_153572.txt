The will of Empire Builder Cecil Rhodes ( 1853-1902 ) generously provided two Oxford scholarships every three years for boys from every U. S. State. * In 1902 , when the will was executed , there were 45 States . Scholarships were added for Oklahoma ( 1907 ) , Arizona and New Mexico ( 1912 ) . In 1929 , Rhodes Scholar Frank Aydelotte , president of Swarthmore College and U. S. executor of the Rhodes Trust , knocked on the door of Parliament and had the Trust amended to establish eight districts of six States with twelve scholarships apiece , an arrangement which has since eliminated many an indifferent backwoods candidate . Last week alert Trustee Aydelotte was fittingly rewarded for this and other Rhodes services when Oxford University made him an honorary Doctor of Civil Law . <P> Other 1937 kudos bestowed last week : <P> Amherst College ( Amherst , Mass . ) <P> Henry Lewis Stimson LL.D . <P> Brown University ( Providence , R.
