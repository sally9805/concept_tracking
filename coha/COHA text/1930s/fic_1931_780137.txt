 | CHAPTER XI " IF SUSAN is well enough to eat breakfast she is well enough to come down and get it , " rasped Jonathan Eliphalet Hale , to his son , Timothy , the third morning of the pilgrimage to the birthplace of the groom . " All New York folderols this having breakfast in bed , and making extra trouble for the girl , too . " " Father , my wife is not well this morning and she is not coming down . Mother , if you will tell Marta to fix a tray I myself will take it to Susan . " This was a man speaking to them , not their little boy , Tim , their youngest , and Mr. and Mrs. Hale said no word as Timothy left the room . Tim 's voice had been quiet , but actually he was shaking with rage . Seeing his family these last two days through the eyes of New York and marriage he was appalled by his father 's overbearing rudeness to his mother and her spineless docility . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mother . He had preferred his own thoughts to theirs . But he had never questioned their behavior . This well-meant visit was beginning to look like a mistake . After two more months of sampling Florida , in which Timothy 's faith in his talents was restored by magazine acceptances and his city-fagged body renewed by sun and green waters , they had suddenly grown weary of the rusty dishevelment of palmettoes and hummock , of gritty shell  | roads and glaring beaches , and of the forlorn tourists who believed that where there is a playground the play spirit will also be provided . Tim and Sue began to yearn for a fresh northern spring . " Let 's go to the old home town and get the family visit over , " announced Tim one morning upon opening his eyes . They both sat up in bed and grinned at each other delightedly . " Let 's ! Let 's go today ! Tee-rains , travelin ' ! " " No , no , Susannah , you do n't know my family . A week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd be cheating them of half the fun of our visit if they were hot allowed to discuss it at all three meals every day and with every one in the street and with Marta , our hired gal , and with all the tradespeople , and with ye scribe of the Bannerman , Ohio , Banner , where all our doings of the past two years have doubtless been chronicled and where now the date of our arrival will be announced in full , and Mother will read it fourteen times in public and Father thirteen times in private  --  no , dolly , no dropping in on my family ! ... " They 'll have a cleaning-woman in to help Marta to polish the floors and beat the rugs and clean the windows and the glass on the pictures , and Mother will get out all the cut glass and real silver from the top of the closet in the spareroom , and her pet tea set , a monstrous thing of gilt and wild roses , and they 'll probably buy that lamp for the sitting-room they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Father will go down to the cellar and poke at the window screens and wonder if they can manage without another ton of coal , and each evening they will sit as usual on either side of the center table in the sitting-room and wonder with trepidation what you are going to be like , and Father will reassure Mother and tell her the Hales of New England have nothin ' to fear from nobody , and they 'll plan a big dinner for you and sweat over every salted almond and chunk of watermelon pickle and whom they ought to ask ,  | and will Marta be able to serve in the way to which you have been accustomed ? " " Yes , me that 's been serving myself for the last ten years with all the ceremony of a cattleboat , " Susan laughed . " But honestly , Tim , you are a wonder ! Where did you ever notice all those details of housekeeping ? They 're perfect ! " " Oh , I 'm a good lil noticer , I am , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they neared the railroad station of Bannerman , Susan saw that he was nervous . He kept warning her now how small the town was , how modest the house , how fine a lawyer his father was , what an influence for good his mother was in the community . " I have n't been back in eight years . I 'll be almost as much a stranger as you . For heaven 's sake , Sue , do n't put on any airs . Be prepared to have every one slap me on the back and reminisce about my unspeakable childhood , and call you the little bride . " " They wo n't ? " " They will ! And be sure to tell every one that Bannerman is the prettiest town you ever were in . We wo n't stay long and we might as well make a hit to please Father and Mother . You will try to understand ? " His appeal made her at once annoyed and eager to oblige . Annoyed because she never thought she put on airs until after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of coping with any situation . She had no qualms about meeting her parents-in-law , only a sharp curiosity and a city-bred patronage . But she sincerely did not wish to show the latter . " Timmy ! " his mother 's voice was falsely bright with a note of appeal in it . " Here 's the tray for Susan . Is there anything I can do for her ? " " Thank you , Mother , she 'll be down in a few hours , "  | and he closed the bedroom door before the older woman had turned away . Had his mother been reading the women 's magazines j on how to arrange a breakfast tray or was the tight little bunch of crocuses a peace offering ? Poor soul , he hated hurting her but his father had to be made to understand that there was to l ) c no more bullying . Up to this morning Mr. Hale had been polite but impersonal , rather handsome and dignified in his iron-gray way . Tim could not tell if either of them had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been excited over everything Susan had said and worn , had asked her advice about the dinner party , and Susan had responded instantly to the flattery .... And now this outburst from his father . For two pins he 'd pack up and leave on the noon train . Just because Susan bore the family name she was nevertheless still a stranger to them , and he knew she hated a too sudden breaking down of formalities . What was that she used to quote ? " Love thy neighbor but pull not down thy fence " ? That was the trouble everywhere in America , no fences , no privacy , for thought or action . At Harvard in his senior year he had loved sitting in his window , sensitively aware of the tree-shadowed seclusion of the Yard ; he had reveled in pictures of English t walled gardens and moated castles and chateaux on unapproachable summits . What beautiful isolation  --  with just Sue and a sun dial ! He 'd better tell Susan about the rumpus for she would be sure to sense something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , I think if my amiable male parent does n't apologize we 'd better be leaving on the noon train today . We could go down to Cincinnati on a bust . You 've never been there , have you ? " " Why I never heard of anything so ungracious ! And we have been angels since we have been here ! Getting up at seven for no reason that I can discover except that your pa  | does n't like to stay in bed after six-thirty . Breaking our necks to be on time for meals , because he prides himself on being the , local Greenwich meridian . Having to be exhibited at eery street corner as the Little Bride , and gushing ? " " Look here , I warned you , and you know that you enjoy being exhibited . You have all the modesty about that sort of thing of the Fat Lady in a side show . " " Yes , you 're right there .... Shall I get up and dress ? " " No , I 'll take the tray down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their immediate departure , Mrs. Hale burst into tears . " Timmy , you know your father , you know he does n't mean anything by it . He 's getting old and awfully set about meal times . Do n't do anything until I have seen him . Promise ? " and she pulled down his head and rubbed her crumpled cheek against his sunburnt one . In a few minutes he saw her trotting down the street in the direction of his father 's office . At twelve o'clock dinner , four people sat down stiffly . Lawyer Hale was almost urbane . He asked Susan how she was feeling , he praised the roast shoulder of lamb with onion sauce , he revealed that he had brought back the latest Woman 's Home Companion with a story of Tim 's in it . " Already ? " and Timothy leaped up , dashed to the sittingroom table , and was back again ruffling through the pages to find how that hazardous first story written in St. Augustine looked in print . Midday dinner decorum was shattered for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at the illustrations Tim shoved between him and the lamb . Then Susan almost snatched it , and was tolerant when Marta leaned over her shoulder to stare and almost poured the pitcher of ice water into her lap .... " Oh , Tim , the people are dressed all wrong , and you said a surrey and the artist 's drawn a buggy ! "  | After lunch Mr. Hale delayed his return to the office by fifteen minutes . Said Timothy to Susan : " Is n't Father wonderful ! Not one word of apology though his every action said I 'm sorry . ' We might as well accept the olive branch bare as it is . And Mother is radiant . Give her a hug when you 're alone , and I 'll drop in casually to see Father this afternoon . God knows what 's going on in his tight mind .... But say , is n't it great that story came out wliilc we were here ? It will sort of convince the town that there 's some connection between the published story they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinner Party to Introduce the Bride , who had already been fairly completely introduced on street corners . Beginning with a telegram to Cincinnati for carnations , which seemed to be the standard floral centerpiece for Bannerman parties , the house had been in a turmoil . All morning there had been much sweeping and dusting , and the usual ample midday meal had been a skimpy , reluctant : clfair . Mr. Hale. was almost pushed out of the house , and in a frenzy the dining-table was dragged apart and its dusty skeleton exposed . Fourteen people had been invited . The feelings of at least thirty more had apparently been hurt because they had been left out . " Ask them to come in after dinner and serve a little supper at eleven , " suggested Susan . " ' That would be worse than not inviting them at all , " wailed Mrs. hale . " Stick to your fourteen then , and let them eat comfortably instead of crowding more and making them feed in each other 's plates , " said Susan . She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always received the same answers , " But we never do that here , " or " You have no idea how limited our variety of food is . " So Susan merely  | helped to decide that four extra leaves for the table would most certainly be enough . The company tablecloth with the large monogram was the right length but the table pad was not . " Try a blanket , " said Susan . Then came the search for extra chairs which would n't look too obviously filched from the bedrooms and the bathroom . By five o'clock the table had taken on the look of a sales counter . Bowls and dishes of cutglass and silver were filled with olives , celery , salted nuts , red jelly , green jelly , watermelon pickle , chocolates , colored mints , shiny candy , and over all the carnations flopping on their too long and ugly bony stems . Susan leaned against the door dizzied by the antics of the three women : the extra girl to wait on table and Mrs. Hale and Marta all with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darting back and forth between kitchen and dining-room with the seeming purposelessness of atoms . " Mrs. Hale , do stop . You 'll be all tired out when the guests come , " and Susan pulled out from the set table one of the fourteen chairs . " No , not that chair , " and Mrs. Hale pushed it back in its place . " Heavens , we 've forgotten the place-cards , and I bought some especially . " She opened her desk in the sitting-room , revealing a scooping up of odds and ends which had been locked away for the evening . " Here they are . Are n't they cute ? " An unusually pot-bellied Kewpie bride and groom standing beneath a wedding bell . " They are sweet , " lied Susan . " Ca n't I write the names for you , and then you might tell me who the people are so I wo n't make awful blunders ? " The names were German and English in origin ; the occupations , the leading doctor , Mr. Hale 's law partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the Boston  | Store , and the Presbyterian minister , and , of course , their very respective wives . " Dear Mrs. Hale , why not the Mayor ? " " Oh , no , no one ever asks the Mayor ! " Mrs. Hale was shocked . " But I feel like a child being allowed to sit up with the grown folks . Can I have a second helping ? " Mrs. Hale was plainly uncomprehending . " Why , of course , my dear , there will be plenty of everything . I ordered four large chickens from that Mrs. Sagendorf , who owes Mr. Hale such a big bill .... But you and Timmy will be pleasant to every one ? I never could count on what Tim was going to say next . Now I think I 'll take my bath . " At the foot of the stairs she paused . " Susie  --  did any one ever call you that ? I 'd like to , may I ? I 've been meaning to ask you something all this last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair dulled to a soiled white , and her ( lumpy figure in a gingham overall conveyed the picture of a bashful little girl rubbing the sole of one shoe on the worn toe of the other . " Here in Bannerman the sons ' wives always call their mothers-in-law Mother : You never do and I can see everybody thinks it strange . I have come to love you , Susie , in this last week , though I was a little afraid of you in the beginning , you 're so quick and up and-away , but you 're sweet down deep , and I 've never had a ( laughter , and perhaps just tonight you could call me ' Mother . ' " Susan 's eyes filled . She took the smaller woman in her arms and kissed her on both cheeks  --  Susan never kissed people on the mouth , except Tim  --  and explained : " I have come to love you , too , this last week , and I admire so much the fine work you have done for the Child Welfare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timmy . But you have your fixed ideas about certain things and so have I. And one of them is calling things by their  | honest names . Now you are not my mother ? I have only one  --  and to call you mother ' would seem false to me . But I 'll not call you Mrs. Hale ' but something sweet and silly like Bunny ' or ? " " Oh , no , please do n't do that ! " " All right , how about dearest ' like Lord Fauntleroy ? " Timothy came in and Susan begged him to go for a walk . " Darling , I need it , it 's going to be awful this evening , " and she checked off on her fingers the guests and their professions . He frowned at her . " What 's there so darn funny about these people ? They 're the most important in the town , place would n't exist without them , and coming to welcome you . You should be honored . I hope you have n't made Mother uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . Was he really a small-towner under the skin ? Or was this his usual quick adoption of a new background , shouting stoutly , " Thy country is my country , thy god is my god  --  until I take the train ? " She had often wondered if he did n't have a small-town complex , which made him aggravatingly bumptious when he needed to be quiet and simple . She would watch him this evening and see if he was still impressed by these local pooh-bahs . " What are you going to wear , dinner coat or tails ? " she asked him . " Are you joking ? No man ever dresses here except for a big dance or a political speech , or when they go down to Cincinnati . " " What shall I wear then ? " " Oh , the women dress up . Wear an evening frock , because your arms are so pretty , but simple , you know , " which did n't help much . When they returned from their walk Mrs. Hale was dressed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the street . " Where have you been ? Do you know it is a quarter after six and the dinner is at seven ? " " Cheer up , Mother , we 'll be ready in a jiff , " and Tim leaped up the stairs two at a time . Susan followed , imitating him . " What tic shall I wear with the blue suit , Arbiter Elegantiarum ? " " You are delish in a piccadilly collar and a bow tie . " He was soon ready . " Hurry up , " said he , " it 's ten of seven . " " Everybody 's always late for dinner . I 've loads of time . " Shc was at that point in a woman 's toilet in which nothing seems to have been accomplished and the husband is in despair , then on goes her frock and a lipstick and she is ready . R-r-r-r-r-r-r-ing ! " Everybody , my dove , is not always late for dinner . Sometimes they are ten minutes early ! " and off he went . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown , not in the least suggesting the Little Bride . She touched her cheeks and lips ever so faintly with rouge , sprayed herself discreetly with a gardenia scent , and picking up an evening bag of black sequins shiny as a coat of mail , she hung over the banister to see if most of the guests had arrived . Then she slowly descended the stairs hoping , as she always hoped , she would have an audience . She did . The men were all iii the hall . The women in the parlor . The house walls seemed to be bending out with furnace heat and humans . There seemed to be no place for her to put her slim black satin feet . All the eyes of the men turned up to her . This was what she liked , what any woman liked , even if all the eyes were rheumy or bespectacled . Her husband stood out like Bright Youth among them ; she was thrilled to think he belonged to her . And she could see he was pleased by the effect she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other local shrines.  | " Susan , my dear , I want you to meet Mrs. Urn , and Mrs. Ah , and Mrs. Ip . My new daughter-in-law ? from New York . " Susan stopped herself in time from making curtseys to these dowagers ? the old convent habit still asserted itself whenever she saw a white hair . As she moved from one woman to another she caught a glimpse in the long mirror between two windows of the bareness of her bare back . It was indecent in this assemblage . Oh for a safety pin ! She managed to get her back to the wall and taking a fine hairpin she wiggled it into the tulle edges of the gown and drew it together somewhat nearer her shoulder-blades , and sidled carefully into the dining-room . Susan wondered with a minister present whether grace would be said . It was said . His Presbyterian Reverence cast an appraising eye up and down the long table , almost every i inch covered with something edible , and then murmured : " For these few morsels which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May they sustain us until the morn-ing meal . " " Few morsels ! " thought Susan , indignant for her motherin-law . It seemed to her at the time that the dinner was of an unbearable dullness . After the first oblique but nevertheless searching estimate taken of Sue and Tim by the guests , and the usual zealous demand that Bannerman be confirmed in her belief that she was the Queen of all small cities , the conversation swung to local topics , familiar and comfortable as old shoes . Satisfied by a close-up of the strangers , their interest lapsed . They did not want to know what New York or St. Augustine or Timothy or Susan was thinking and doing . But after ten years when Susan could look back upon dinners consumed in San Francisco and Washington , London and Vienna , Rome and Paris , with place-cards to the right  | of her and place-cards to the left of her inscribed with names which flicked the imagination of two hemispheres , she could remember the same quality of Bannerman dullness , a dullness dismayingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered together around one table . Timothy was squirming with misery . He had eaten too . much and talked too little to be happy . And there was that awful digestive period ahead of them . " Say , Mother , arc you still making that dandelion wine ? " he threw into a well of silence . The silence deepened , though the eyes of the men brightened . " I have n't made any recently , son , but I think I have some left . Why ? " she queried sweetly but obtusely . " Uh , do n't you think it might be a fine idea to have a glass all around and toast my bujus bride ? " " Not a had idea at all , " said the bank president , " especially when it is a bride as pretty as Mrs. Timothy . " Finance and respectability had spoken , and the wives dared to smile . Only Mr. Hale was disapproving . Was his house to be turned into a saloon ? A mug of beer with his dinner when he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey toddy on a winter 's evening did no harm , but this promiscuous drinking at dinner under his roof was a had thing for a lawyer 's reputation . Reluctantly he arose from the table to fetch the wine in the cellar . Marta , excited by the bacchanalian turn the party was taking , produced some rarely used small glasses from the back of the china closet , and revisioned a German childhood peopled with fat-jowled relatives who banged steins on the table and sang martial airs ending with " Drei Mal hoch ! " Prohibition had not yet taught the young Timothys how to drink , so that the dandelion wine was as much a treat for them as the other guests . However , the same expectancy enveloped the room , as in a few years would stir Bannerman 's  | new country club set listening to the chuckling of the cocktail shaker . Mr. Hale reappeared with what seemed to be a highshouldered bottle of vinegar ? it was not a wine bottle . The yellow liquid he poured into the glass at each plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Must make an exception in this exceptional case , " and the reverend sir bowed to Susan . " And now , Father , you make the toast . " Mr. Hale looked blank . He did n't know any toasts . Except those back in college about ? no , none of those would do . The hatchet-faced owner of the Boston store , Adam 's apple bobbing , came surprisingly to the rescue with : " Here 's to the bride and mother-in-law , Here to the groom and father-in-law , Here 's to their friends and their friends-in-law , May none of them need an attorney-at-law ! " At the last words he bowed to Mr. Hale and the whole table laughed at the joke on the lawyer . Mr. Hale returned the bow , not entirely pleased . Susan , whose palate still remembered the wines of her father 's cellar , found the simple-hearted drink unusually good . It was golden and thick , rather like Tokay , and she could feel it making its warm way to her stomach . So did every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as the guests jostled into the parlor . Timothy , who knew this impetus would not last long , whispered to his father , " Let me get another bottle and we 'll serve it in the other room along with the coffee . This is a celebration , you know , " and he was gone before his father could say no . Then they played five hundred , and Susan said , " There must be prizes . " " But I have n't ? I did n't ? " her mother-in-law was abashed .  | " Wait a minute , " and Susan sneaked upstairs to return with a beaded scarf which she had never liked or worn , and a new tie of Tim 's who with some dismay watched her present it to the victorious banker . All this was unorthodox in Mrs. Hale 's eyes , and yet it met with success . Mr. Hale showed them his son 's story in the Woman 's Home Companion , and they asked him just how stories were accepted and how much he was paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines pay awfully well , better than Scribner and Harper and Century , who think you ought to be pleased with the glory of appearing between their dignified covers and an honorarium of three hundred dollars . Well , at that I am pleased . Just sold one to T. R. Smith of the Century . The Post is paying me seven hundred and fifty now and Mr. Lorimer , the editor you know , will probably pay more very soon . He 's the kind that hates to be badgered by agents , but raises a fellow without asking . He 's a prince , he is ! I got eight hundred for this story here because it 's pretty long . " " How long ( lid it take you to write it ? " asked the banker . " About two weeks , was n't it , Sue ? " The banker almost counted on his fingers . He was visibly awed . The minister thought of the sum in terms of his hardearned salary . The women wondered how much of it Timothy gave to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , judging by how dreadfully low this black dress was cut in the back ( the hairpin had slipped its mooring and Susan accustomed to a bare back after seven P.M. was unconscious of her shame ) . The owner of the Boston Store knew stylish clothes when he saw them , though he might not buy them for his customers , and asked Sue if she thought there would be any changes in the fashions next fall . " Yes , radical , I think . This new chemise dress will take hold because it is so practical , and the War is making even the  | French dressmakers practical . These one-piece dresses will be fuller and shorter and the women will have to get thinner to wear them properly . " The least colorless wife told a joke she had heard on her last visit to the City , and Mr. Hale 's constitutionally silent partner ventured a hope that there might some day be another Hale in the firm . This was considered a faux pas by the ladies who threw a smoke screen of chittering between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan was not discomforted . She grinned at them all and said : " The only baby I want for a while is little Goldilocks here , " and she discreetly ruffled her husband 's hair and snuggled against him . His arm went around her and the company oozed sentimental approbation . " Still honeymooners , " the women murmured . " Do you know- what time it is ? Midnight ! " exclaimed the banker , holding his great hunting-case watch close to his shining glasses . All the other men jerked out their watches . " I have one minute after , " said Mr. Hale . Then they were gone and Mrs. Hale sank within her high-cut corsets as she dropped into a chair . " They really seemed to have a good time , did n't they ? They were laughing all the time . " Mr. Hale was hanging the chain across the front door . " Dandelion wine , " he grunted .  | CHAPTER XII SOCIALLY launched now , Tim and Sue went to many other parties all of a sameness as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Seattle and Sauk Center , iii fact like any but the great metropolises , was timorous of adventuring outside its own small circle . But the town never quite got used to them . If Timmy Hale had been a queer kid , he certainly was lots queerer now , and marrying that New York girl with the affected accent and the freaky clothes had n't helped . ( " Indecent I call them . I heard that black party dress of hers was so low you could count every joint in her spine ! " ) And seemingly Susan flouted the town , though actually it was because she had only lived in the privacy of great cities and did not know what espionage meant . Ilcr first offense was about a silver dollar . She had never seen one before , in fact there were not many left now in Ohio , and she was delighted by its novelty . Her father-inlaw 's house was at the top of a tiny hill where dwelt most of the solid red-brick citizenry , It was a morning affirming that spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished fact . Dressed in " freaky clothes " ? a mannish tweed suit and a black glengarry cocked over one eye  --  she and Tim were off for a long walk in the country with a thermos bottle and some sandwiches in a rucksack on Tim 's back . A rucksack , too , was freaky and so was walking in the country . " If you 're a good girl and do n't whine for lunch after  | one mile you shall have this silver dollar , " promised Tim . " I warn it now , " and she grabbed it from him . " I say ! Have you got another one of those cartwheels ? Let 's start even and sec which rolls farthest down this hill . The winner gets both dollars . " " Seeing as the dollars are both mine ? Well , here goes ! " The pavement was smooth and the dollars rolled some distance before they careened off into the grass at the side . " I win ! I win ! " screamed Susan , dancing up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself she saw several scrim curtains being dropped back into place in the neighbors ' windows . " Tim ! How awful ! We were being watched , and heaven knows what they think we were doing . I feel as if I were living in a fish-bowl . Will it be like this all the time we are here , or will they get used to us ? " " I doubt it , " replied Tim grimly . " I had forgotten the spying which is inevitable in every small town simply because it is so small . We 'll just have to watch our step , for Father 's and Mother 's sake . " That afternoon all Bannerman talked of the silver dollar and how those young Hales showed off . But years later the story of the Silver Dollar Race became a Bannerman folk tale tenderly recounted of a Famous Son . That the town should hold it against her because her voice was pitched differently from theirs and she found delight in using more than the seven hundred English words with which most citizens were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But one day she was sitting on the porch of one Tim called a " Mother in Zion , " an old darling in a print wrapper and a large apron who gave her milk and hermit cookies and told her about pioneer days and accepted Susan for the blue of her eyes and because she had given milk and hermit cookies to Tim when he was small . " Call me Aunty Belle ' as Timmy used to and I 'm going  | to call you Susie ' ? it kinda suits you more than Susan . What does your own mother call you ? " " ' Sue ' mostly , and Susannah ' for fun . But I always know people like me when they start calling me Susie ' and you like me , do n't you ? " she pressed Aunty Belle 's crippled hand against her cheek . Then Sue told the old lady about her childhood ; and the woman who had seen Indians and jolted in a prairie schooner asked questions about London and Paris and New York as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small wooden rocker , had sat a granddaughter . Suddenly the child spoke : " Granuna , what language is She talking ? " Aunty Belle tried to shush the child , but Susan burst into laughter . " Is it possible my accent sounds as foreign as all that ? Small One , I thought I was speaking English , but you never can tell . " After two weeks under the parental roof . " Mrs. Timothy Hale , are you awake ? If you are n't you 'd better be ; my father has cleared his larnyx nine times by actual count , and eight of those were hints for us to get up . " Susan was snoozling in the double bed of the spare room , and Tim was sitting upright on a folding cot which he had asked for to the scandal of the household . Tim was an untidy sleeper , had his own methods of wrapping himself around pillows and tangling himself in sheets , and liked to get up at odd hours for drinks of water . Susan was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approvingly the smooth whiteness of the undisturbed linen . Wisely they slept in separate beds . " I 've had enough of Bannerman  --  outgrown the town . Let 's go some place else . " The hobo spirit was flowering in Tim . " Let 's ! Let 's go today . Tee-rains , travelin ' ! " squealed Sue , but a tiny soft squeal .  | " 1 have n't done a lick of work since I 've been here , except think a lot about the new novel . They say every human being has at least one novel in him , and though I 've written two they have n't been that novel . This visit has re-created my boyhood so vividly that I 've got to write about it or die . And having you along , a stranger to it all , has helped me to see the place through your eyes as well as mine . I 'm sick to death of this romanticizing of the small town , this holding on to log-cabin tradition in an actuality of firebrick and arty bungalows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardy pioneers galloping about in hairy pants all over the great open spaces of Main Street and Fourth .

What do you say to ? " " Tee-rains ! " repeated Susan . " Tee-rains nothin ' ! " contradicted Tim . " A Ford ! " Susan stared at him . " A motor car ? " " No , a Ford . " " But can we afford one ? " " We shall , and what 's more we buy it today ? here in Bannerman . " He was out of bed and fumbling for his slippers and bathrobe . " Hurry up , we 'll go down to Liebermann 's Garage and buy one right after breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll drive up to the door and surprise them . " Susan was overwhelmed by the ease with which it was possible to make so revolutionary a purchase . Having decided on the five-passenger as the most practical , there was no further complication , all the cars were exactly alike . Liebermann himself promised to give them a lesson between five and six that very day . Tim wrote him a check , confided to him their  | plan to surprise the senior Hales , which delighted his sentimental German soul , and they were out in the street . " Do we really own a car ? " asked Susan . " It was as simple as buying a bunch of radishes . " That afternoon on a country road Liebermann was disgusted to discover that neither of them had any mechanical sense or very much coordination . Both were obviously terrified when they took the wheel , and backed mor f , n than they went forward . The worst moment was when and himself making for a telegraph pole and instead of to ing the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way . Liebermann seized the wheel just in time . " I fink you hot had enough for one day . We try again tomorrow at ( lc same time . " Two more lessons and Tim , with Susan beside him , was driving up to the portal of Jonathan Eliphalet Hale , hoping to heaven lie would n't stall on the hill . They stopped neatly in front of the old stone carriage step and Tim applied the brake with such force that he almost tossed Susan out on the curb . I le sounded the horn with shrill peremptoriness . Marta , setting the table for supper , came to the dining-room window . Again the horn . The front door was flung back and Father and Mother I talc , with Marta close behind displayed all the astonishment , and more , that Tim had hoped for . Down the walk the older people hurried . " I low about a little ride after supper this evening ? " Tim asked airily . " Is it yours ? When did you buy it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from and what did he charge you ? " demanded Mr. Hale . All through what Susan thought was the nicest meal in the Hale day ? this particular evening , cold meat loaf and creamed potatoes , lettuce always shredded and rather vinegary , hot muffins and tea , grand homemade pickles and jams and  | esker and stewed fruits , served in a spring twilight which fell softly on the white painted woodwork and pleasantly faded flowered wallpaper  --  all through supper the car and its puri hale were discussed to the last detail . Mr. Hale was shocked that Timothy had paid for the car in a lump sum . " But if I had the money , why not ? " After supper Tim began to regret his offer . Suppose it became clark before they got home . Ford lights were so darn tricky . But there was Mother tying a chiffon veil around her hat and Father putting on an overcoat and a cap . With sick fear lest he break his wrist Susan watched Tim spin the starter . After two failures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared . The occupants of the back seat stiffened with alarm . Tim managed to coil his long legs in the tiny front space , and with a neck-snapping jerk they were off . At fifteen cautious miles an hour they made for the country , clinging close to the right hand side of the road . After twenty minutes Tim began to look for a broad cross-road in which to turn without backing . " Getting kinda dark , Father , do n't you think ? " and without waiting for confirmation Tim swerved the car in a wide arc and headed its bread-box hood back to town . They were safely home again . " How many times did you say you had driven , Tim ? " asked his father . " This evening 's the fourth time , " Tim answered overcasually . " Well , you certainly managed her pretty nicely . " The paternal voice was admiring . Story-writing was one thing , but driving a car was something else again . Another week to let the town digest the wonder of the young Hales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They were leaving , after only a month 's visit to the Folks , for an automobile trip to the Coast !  | In 1916 such trips had elements of a Voyage of Discovery . Every village had its garage , but the villages were wide apart , the garages converted stables , and the mechanics half-converted stablemen . The Lincoln Highway was often only two grooves in a Dakota wheat field , and drivers gave lifts of fifty miles and were in honor bound to stop and help a stalled car . Mud holes were frequent and not every farmhouse had a telephone . It was a stupid motorist who planned a long journey unaccompanied by a shovel , a steel cable , extra gasoline , spare tubes , and a lantern .... Aviation will have its thrills but necessarily it will remain as remote as the air in which it has its being , whereas early motoring was close , very close , to the earth and the inhabitants thereof . The hegira of the Timothy Hales lasted six months , from Ohio to Washington and down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , in fifty-cent-a-night barracks and five-dollar-a-day palaces . They remained a whole month in Seattle where a letter to a millionaire lumberman resulted in parties of highballs and fried chicken served at tea-time , where they ( lanced in a privat allroom surrounded by Paris frocks , where it was dangerous ress even a literary interest in the I. W. W.s , and where was interviewed and photographed as a successful author and asked to speak before the School of Journalism at the University . From a Harvard classmate , Timothy had heard of the charms of Carmel , California . Here Jack London and George Sterling , around beach fires of driftwood , had sung songs of the Philippine soldier and told tales of their excursions into strange seas and socialism . It had been a long time since Tim had talked hooks as " shop " and the prospect of living among a group of writers excited him . Why not Carmel for the winter ? Carmel among the pines was luke-warm in its reception . The Hales were not Native Sons . The Hales were neither de- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bannerman had bored them , here they were rendered uneasy by the jealous literary gossip , bitter enough to sour the nightly ration of mulled wine . " My God , that was a terrible story of Rudy 's in the last Collier 's ! How do you suppose he puts it over ? ... Of course , if my Joe wanted to write down to the public he could sell his stories as fast as he writes them .... Frankly , Larry , the old granite-face , does not make me laugh , and yet I hear the Post is paying him fifteen hundred an instalment for his so-called humor ! " No one escaped the forum , no one was safe . But the Hales had a bungalow that was a model of domestic electrical appliances and redwood and wicker comfort . They had their first Chinese servant whose lacquered hair and spotless linen , whose economical and epicurean use of fish fins and cock 's combs , were a daily delight to eye and palate . At their very door they had the sea and the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the dunes , the fields of yellowest poppies ; and over all a flying confusion of white gulls and black crows . And  --  they had a baby coming . So each chill November morning Susan was very , very sick , and Timothy built a fire in the living-room and set up the card-table in front of it for breakfast , and started the coffer percolator , and Susan drank her first cup , and stopped beg sick ; and Timothy typed faster and faster and longer and longer each day . Sometimes the magazines delayed payment , and he would lie awake at night and listen to the pounding surf or the drip of the fog on the screens , and wonder if perhaps he was not caught in the very trap he had so deftly escaped in a Long Island suburb . A baby ! Susan no longer free to play with him , to take tee-rains at a moment 's notice , Susan tired , bedraggled , nagging , nursing a smelly , whining bundle . This morning after her bout of nausea , crouching over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusing  | the coffee he had made her , she was an unkempt primitive woman , a gray hag brooding by a fire of little sticks . After a while Susan stopped being sick and grew prettier and rounder than she had ever been before , and they began to discover another Carmel , jolly people who did not write and whom they packed into the Ford for picnics down the Carmel Valley . They visited the Missions on the Camine Real and dined on abalone steaks and red wine in Monterey , and typed and typed and talked and talked . Between short stories the new novel was taking shape . In the next two years of writing Tim was to change the scaffolding a dozen times , but scarce a day passed that he did not add to his supply of bricks and mortar . He had bought his first gray cloth notebook , such as students use , with loose leaves which were constantly being removed from their shiny rings to be recorded with strange proper names , local flora and fauna , with drawings of maps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at catching talk at restaurant tables behind her or Pullman chairs two down the aisle . " What are they saying , Elephant Ears ? " Tim would whisper to her . Perhaps it was something the butcher had said at the market or some titbit she had overheard at the stationery shop . Home then she would trot as pleased as a bird-dog with her prize , and would drop it at Tim 's feet in the form of a typewritten slip . Always Tim carried a small note-book , also loose-leaved , in the inside pocket of his jacket . Where most men in a crowd would instinctively feel for their gold watches or their wallets , Tim 's hand would dart toward the note-book pocket . If he mislaid it , there was no rest in the house until it had been found . The title for the new novel came to him rather early . It was an excellent title , so excellent they hardly dared let themselves think about it lest this sneaky thing called " thought  | transference " convey it to some stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , one might say the baby , too , was taking shape . Susan had a lot of ideas about babies , mostly absorbed from her magazine experience . She obeyed implicitly the doctor 's orders , because she was taking care of a life not her own . She wore sensible shoes , but not sensible clothes ? none of those ' bleary brown and navy blue crepe de chines with shirred elastic waistlines that shrieked their mission . She wore broad hats and a fur-collared cape , and gay colors . At home the smock was her day uniform , with a tea-gown for dinner . She found she liked men 's , especially bachelors ' , forthright attitude toward pregnancy better than the sentimental drooling of women . Tim was infinitely tender toward her , but his care was for her , not for the baby . She watched for some sign of the proud father , the concern for an heir , even the smug satisfaction in this expression of his manhood , but no , the baby did not exist for him . She loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to love the baby , too . It was coming at just the right time , and a welcome baby is sure to be a happy baby , a beautiful baby , the old wives told . Perhaps when Tim held the little thing in his arms ? They talked about it , of course . They wanted it born in New York with a very good doctor in a very good hospital . It was n't to be a Junior under any circumstances . Suppose Tim was to be the great success that half the time he felt sure he would be , then what a curse for a child to have the same name as his well-known father ! Suppose the child turned out a writer ? doubly cursed ! Oh yes , look at Dumas Pere et Fils , but they were an exception . And Fils could n't stand Pere after Fils had grown up . Susan could not sew . She could darn a sock lumpily and anchor buttons , but that was all . Young mother bending pretty face over gossamer mysteries of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole layette in half an hour in New York ,  | and a simple one , too , because Tim did not seem interested in having three in succession . All of which did not mean that she was not thrilled at being a mother . The first time she felt the stirring of life her throat tightened and she cried and cried beyond reason . She read books on obstetrics and pediatrics and would say cozily to Tim : " I think he must have his nails by this time . I expect he has eyelashes now . " Although it was to be a midsummer baby , Tim thought it best to get back cast soon and rent a house within quick motoring distance of the hospital . First babies were unreliable . Also one of his stories had been turned down by three magazines with what seemed to him inadequate regret . He was too far away from his source of income . Yip , better get back . It was all very well to say that the personal element was negligible , that there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mattered was : Produce the goods . But being able to call an editor " Bill " certainly did n't hurt , and he felt he was popular with them , partly because he had been an editor himself , because he turned in neat copy and on time , did n't have to have his dates and references verified , and he had heard of copyright and libel laws . For a lone wolf Tim was an astonishingly good mixer . What he really wanted was an audience , and to get that he had to listen to others occasionally . Except of course when he was after certain writable qualities in a man , then he was the reporter supreme . He was not a he-man with his slender blondness , nor given much to lewd talk  --  smutty stories as smut bored him . But disillusioned older men renewed themselves in his ebulliencies , and after a lunch with him would return to the office and take out of the lower left-hand drawer of the desk that story they were always going to finish , and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , and at five P.M. put it back again in the drawer .... Yip , thought Tim , time to be getting back to see Bill and the boys .  | Time also to sell the Ford . Susan could not possibly motor back . They advertised in the Carmel paper and all too quickly a buyer appeared . They hated to give the car up . They loved it . They knew it was different from all other Fords . " Let 's sell it only to some one who will really appreciate it . " So they turned down the offer of the local dealer and waited . Two girls just out of the University of California and in Carmel on a visit called . " We want to tour the whole state this summer , camping along the way , " said one . Said the other , " I ca n't believe you have traveled all these miles in this car . It 's so bright and shiny , " and with her handkerchief she gave -a housewifely rub to the gleaming fender . Tim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray woolly blankets and an air mattress and lots of odds and ends we used for camping . Would you like to see them ? " " We have n't so very much money , " said the girls , " but . we knight take a peek . " The Hales disappeared into the house to give them a chance to talk it over . " Let 's throw in all the camp outfit , they 're so nice . Did n't you love the way she rubbed the fender ? " said Tim . " But , Tim , think of what those things cost us in Bannerman . " Next day with a rather too small check in Tim 's hand , he and Sue watched their Ford , piled with the blankets and kitchen utensils , being driven down the sandy road by strangers . Surreptitiously they had patted the car as the girls got in , and when the tiny red tail-light they had filled so often with kerosene jolted around the bend , they laid their faces against each other 's shoulders and cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growled Timothy . " Where 's my hankie ? " and he wiped away Sue 's tears , then blew his own nose .  | CHAPTER XIII . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . IN MAY , 1917 , Tim and Sue were staying in a New York hotel waiting for the owners to leave the house the Hales had taken for the summer . It was in Spuyten Duyvil , that hill-top village within the limits of the great city yet as isolated from it as a desert mesa . The modest vicarage in which they were to live was surrounded by vast green lawns , driveways of proud-crested elms , by brass-bright 1910 Simplexes housed in huge stables of the Hudson River Bracketed era . Meanwhile They were dressing at the hotel for a dinner party given by an unknown . Tim 's ruddy face was at its best above the clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly hair had gone up exactly right and she was standing in front of the bureau admiring the filled-out hollows in her neck and the new swell to her breasts . " Tim , see that neck and back ! Theda Bara has nothing on me ! " In turning to pick up her evening wrap , she caught a profile view of herself in the full-length mirror in the bathroom door . She was wearing the same dress with which she had first shocked Bannerman  --  the ample black satin and tulle draperies had adjusted themselves admirably to her changing figure . But now the skirt was hiked up grotesquely in front and she seemed to lean perilously backwards . What an ostrich she had been ! Her distortion had come about so gradually that it was as if she were seeing herself enceinte for the first time .  | Timmy , I ca n't go , I wo n't go , this way among strangers . II have to go without me , make excuses , tell the truth-1 did so feel like a party this evening ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sob furiously . " I 'm ; Iikc those old people in the fairy tale who were given ' wishes . Do you remember ? " She struggled up and faced ' tears on her cheeks . " Without thinking , the woman for a pudding . And there it was . In a rage at this wastof one wish , her husband wished the pudding on her . And horrors , there it was on her nose ! Then they had use the third precious wish to wish it off again .... Only I - n't wish this damn pudding off ! " and she struck her abdomen an angry blow . " Sue ! Sue ! Control yourself . It 's only two months more , and then you 'll have something better than a pudding . " " Pudding face probably ! " She was not to be comforted . " Better hurry up or your hostess will be fuming . Is she pretty ? " " I do n't remember . I just met her at an authors ' tea . " " I bet she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in the old yellow frame house where Susan was expecting hers . The rooms were airy , there was a sleeping porch , and above all a study , booklined and furnished with a broad desk , comfortable chairs , sturdy small tables upon which to pile things , and a pleasant sense of trees without ? a perfect place to work . The clergyman 's wife was charmed that another baby was to sleep beneath her roof and she loaned Sue her bassinet for that very purpose . From now on the Hale baby was to lead a rented life . As they moved from one furnished house to another he fell temporary heir to beds and bathtubs , scales and carriages , sleds and bicycles . His only personal luggage was a suitcase full of clothes , given away instantly he outgrew them , a magnificent traveling ice-box , and a small enamel pot .  | Tim had insisted upon a distinguished obstetrician . A jolly fellow he was , and they both liked him , though Susan wondered how he could stand those daily visits of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white tissue paper . So she asked him . " I love ' em all , " he replied uxoriously , and he beamed like a well-shaved sultan and the father of every child-to-be in the waiting-room . Tim had bought a second-hand , middle-priced car on the expert advice of Sue 's brother who was a successful but still dissatisfied motor salesman , hating Broadway in all its shoddiness , and yet without the guts to leave the New York he valued but which cared nothing for him . He showed far more interest in the baby 's coming than did Tim , and of course Mrs. Brooke was traditionally English in her anxiety that flit-firstborn be a boy . Two hot nights before the baby arrived , the doctor had dined with them , and they were now drinking coffee on the cool sleeping porch . The new French cook , another Clemente without the diamond combs in her hair and enchanted at the prospect of a baby , interrupted with a " Pardon , madame , a telephone for Monsieur le docteur . " " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " suggested Susan . And then she overheard : " Broke , has it ? Pains coming pretty often ? ... Well , get her to the hospital at once . I 'll be along in an hour or two , " and he was back on the porch , bland and smiling in his cream linen clothes and asking for another cup . " Little lady , that husband of yours should have been a doctor . Not a baby-snatcher like me , but a scientist , research . Got the scientific mind he has , and asks darn intelligent questions for a layman . " " But , doctor , that was a woman expecting a baby  --  over  | the telephone , was n't it ? " Susan was holding on to the edge of her chair . " Yes . " " Well , are n't you going to do anything about it ? We love having you here but ought n't you to be going ? " Susan was more than anxious . The doctor burst out laughing . " Bless your heart , she wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of my stewing about in that hot hospital when I can be cool and comfortable up here and talking to a pretty woman like you ? " Susan hated him at this moment . Was he going to treat her as cavalierly when her time came ? For two pins she 'd change her obstetrician at the last minute . The doctor winked at Timothy . " I know just what you 're thinking . There 'll be preliminary pains , my dear , and only you can help yourself . You have a fine nurse , one of my best , and I want you to know that I shall be with you long pefore you really need me , " and his voice grew gentle and he patted her hand . Two nights later she did need him . There was plenty of time , the doctor said , to get to the hospital , " so do n't drive fast , son , and kill her on the way . " As they came to the theater district it was eight-fifteen , and Susan had a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open car and tell the silly theater-goers , " I am going to have a baby in a few hours . " Susan had read dozens of descriptions of child-birth but none had prepared her for her own sufferings . Indeed there ; is no way for a woman to tell a man what that special pain is like . With her it went on for hours and hours but she bore it until she heard herself make a cry like a wounded animal , so utterly un-human that she was terrified and she screamed , " Damn you , this has gone on long enough ! " And so they operated and it was a Caesarean baby .  | If Tim had not acted the expectant father , he certainly was the **40;307;TOOLONG . Susan had refused to see him after the final hours had reduced her to a twisted rag . He prowled the hospital halls , drank whiskey out of a large bottle , and every time he heard a cry he would rush to Susan 's door certain it was her last . " Hale , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , I 'm telling you , but it 's going to be a long pull . There 's nothing you can do . Go back to your hotel and write about your sensations . They 'll be valuable some day . " Back in the hotel where he was staying while Susan was to be in the hospital , Timothy stripped to his B. V. D. 's , so hot was the July night , and with the perspiration falling from his chin onto his hands as he typed , his eyes wandering again and again to the telephone , he wrote a short story about a man whose whole life had been ruined by mother love . One of the best scenes was where the mother tells her son how she suffered to give him birth and how he can never repay her for that suffering . " What an understanding this young Hale has , " said the editor who accepted the story . " Mrs. Hale , do n't you want to see your perfect ten-p And baby ? " " What kind is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Susan went back to sleep . An actor 's baby , a singer 's baby , a painter 's baby , an author 's baby ? the world views their arrival as something different from the advent of a butcher 's or a broker 's or even of a lawyer 's child . In America the arts are still of relative unimportance , yet when Male Hale , No. 36759 , was certified by the Department of Health to have been born , quite a number of people wrote pieces in the paper about it and prophecies were made , and a sculptress called at the hospital and felt  | the child 's bumps knowingly , and fellow writers and illus. trators sent Susan jingles and sketches of yellow-haired infants in frilly dresses pecking with fat fingers at a typewriter . On the first day when Susan was allowed to take a short walk down the corridor of the private ward , she cuddled her nurse 's arm and wondered if it would n't be possible to see her baby lying in his crib . " You know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peep in and a peep out wo n't contaminate the most sterile baby , " she wheedled . There they were  --  ten white iron baskets with a card tied to each . Susan looked them all over and was especially shocked by one fragment done up in wads of cotton batting . " Incubator baby , " said the nurse . " Weighs only two pounds . " " The size of a small steak , " remarked Susan . " Now that 's a nice one , " she exclaimed , as she paused in front of the sixth basket . " How jolly and strong , bigger than all the others ! " The nurses burst out laughing . " He 's yours ! Did n't you know ? "  | CHAPTER XIV FOR A MONTH after Susan and the baby returned to the Spuyten Duyvil house Susan never passed a mirror without fresh delight in her slimness . And learning to care for the baby was the jolliest game she had ever played . She had brought back with her a trained baby nurse , a gray-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tll household was too modest to justify trays being sent to the nurse 's room ? indeed , Mrs. Taliaferro ( of Virginia , she always added ) was the sort whose feelings would have been hurt by such ostracism . But Tim and Sue were thus robbed of their treasured privacy at table , and when the nurse informed Sue that she was thrilled to be in an author 's home because of the high literary conversation she hoped to hear , the young Ilalcs went out of their way to be destructive , slangy , profane , but oftenest , dull . Mrs. Taliaferro never again had the same awe of the printed page . Lying in bed in the hospital with two electric fans blowing a draft across her to lift the burden of her pain and the heat of July nights ; now lying in bed on the sleeping-porch open on three sides to elms rustling with the awakening of little birds , Susan pondered her future . With the arrival of the baby , she must sail their ship in a new direction , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a haven . Tim had been steering up to now , though when his hands were busy with the typewriter she took the helm . But they had a  | new passenger , who , speechless , demanded fresh milk and a peaceful backwater instead of tinned milk and the turbulent seas of adventure . Nor would she be averse to a home of her own ? the Long Island house had been hers such a short while . She was weary of living in hotels or caring for other women 's possessions at so much a month . Her own childhood had been spent on the branch ; she wanted something more secure for her son . And would n't Tim , snoring politely over there , do better work in surroundings so familiar that he was spared the constant readjustment to a new table and chair , a door that opened out instead of in , a flapping shade , a dripping from a leaking spout ? ... There was only one master 's bathroom in this shabby old house . Susan had noted with wistful eyes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smudgy pencilings of the heights of the rectory children at various ages . How sweet if her child could look back on such a sentimental recording . The drowsy murmurs of the birds had changed to shrill comments on the lack of early worms . The nurse tiptoed to her bed with the baby for his six o'clock feeding . Susan 's nightgown was sticky from the oozing milk . " Left breast , Mrs. Hale , " nurse whispered so as not to wake Mr. Hale . Sue had heard that some women take a sexual pleasure in nursing an infant , but all she felt was a thanksgiving that she was continuing to make a good job of motherhood . Because of a pelvic imperfection , her child had been born under ideal conditions for him  --  no ugly forceps and malformations ? and as he lay at her breast she admired the beauty of his head , the arching of eyebrow and the flatness of ear , and above all that appraising expression of his deep-set blue eyes . The baby gone she did not go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of life ? They knew so many people but they had no friends . Since their return to New York , deserted summer husbands often came to sec them , charmed to have a cool place to dine within subway  | distance of home . They would sit on the screened sleepingporch which Susan had disguised as a living-room , and drink iced fruit juices and ginger ale minus gin . None of these men was a native New Yorker . They lived in flats , which were only sleeping quarters , for their wives often worked , too , and if there was a child it went to an all-day school or a country boarding-school . These men were apt to know each other , for Tim liked to share acquaintances , but they were in no sense a group , a gang , who ran in and out of each other 's homes and took their pleasures in mass formation . Since their marriage Sue and Tim had been in New York too little to " belong , " and they were not naturally " joiners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of her mother and brother had no relatives . In visiting Bannerman she had had no sense of acquiring a new family , something she had always hoped for in marriage . The lawyer and his wife were merely two more kindly people she had met while traveling , and she was a bit shocked to see that Tim felt as she did . Lone wolves , lonely wolves . If they were not to have ancestors nor inherit ancestral estates , they had best become ancestors themselves . " As soon as we can afford it , and when we find a really good man , I think we ought to have our portraits painted . " Susan wrinkled her nose and smiled foolishly to herself . " Just wiry are you making bunny-noses at yourself at the crack of dawn ? " Tim woggled the pillow behind his neck so he could see her better . " Was I ? I was thinking how silly and how nice it would be for us to start in right now being ancestors for the baby . " " Ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an ancestor . I want my breakfast . " " Fat chance until eight o'clock ... . Tim , I mean that about ancestors . We 've both got good stock behind us , but we are living in a generation so new that we might as well be Adam and Eve . Let 's start a new family for  --  by the way ,  | had n't we better do something about naming our little Cain or Abel ? No Timothy , Junior , nor Jonathan Eliphalet II , and no literary names like David and Peter and Robin . I 've always rather fancied Polycarpe or Vladimir myself . " " Or Sylvester or Vivian ? " " Have n't you one wealthy relative who would be excited at having his name given to this peerless child ? " Susan pleaded . " We-e-e-ll , there 's Uncle Roger , who has a sheep ranch in Tasmania . " " Timmy , a grand name ! " and Susan kicked up the bedclothes at the bottom and wiggled her bare feet in the air . " Master- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's write the uncle this morning and maybe he 'll send young Roger a woolly lamb fresh off the ranch or one of those silver foodpushers which , coming from Tasmania , ought to arrive in time to make an excellent wedding-present for him . What kind of sheep are Tasmanian sheep ? " " You know as well as I do there ai n't no Uncle Roger , " replied Tim . " From now on there 's going to be . Nothing upsets people more than to be told a child has been named after no one . Most unorthodox . Roger Hale , Roger Hale , Roger Hale  --  do you honestly like it ? I do .... Now that 's settled let 's go on to what I 've been worrying about for some time ? a home for Roger Hale . " " What 's the matter with this home ? " inquired Timothy . " Silly , it 's only ours until October , and then what ? Do n't let 's leap off into space as usual . Sir , remember I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave . " I thought you said a baby would n't make any difference to our wanderings . Are you both trying to chain me up so soon ? " Timothy 's eyes were cold , his mouth tight and rebellious . " Tim , old thing , do n't look at me like that , " and Susan  | was out of her bed and beside his , on her knees . " Tim , it is n't that the baby and I want to tie you down , I only feel that if we had a simple house somewhere all our own , in Connecticut or Westchester , not too far from New York , it would serve as a place to sally forth from and to return to when we were tired . If we had a few acres you could build that workroom you have always talked about with the Lshaped desk and a ten-foot couch and shelves and shelves and shelves . Your mind could relax ? " " I do n't want my mind to relax . That 's what 's the trouble with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to feel ? " " But you do n't feel , at least not enough . You see superbly , but to feel deeply you have to sit still occasionally . And sit still you never do  --  not even when you are sitting . That 's why I thought a home ? " " My dear , your presence in a room is home enough for me  --  for some time to come.s for the baby  --  how do you know that babies do n't like a change in nurseries ? This one will , I can tell by the way he reaches for everything new he sees . How about some breakfast ? " Susan sighed . " I hear the lily maid of France clumping down the backstairs . I 'll tell her to hurry the coffee . " Susan gone , Timothy picked up his pillow with two hands and thwacked it back on the bed , his head on top of it . " I wo n't he caught , " he muttered .... When Susan returned later with a cup of coffee he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , so that all summer long Timothy had felt a pot-boilerish quality creeping into the short stories he felt driven to write . To remain in good standing with himself , he would turn to the novel , re-writing the opening chapter , juggling proper names , and buying more and more gray cloth note-books to hold the vast accretion of material . He had just sold a series of  | held together by the same central character , and there more money than usual in the bank . Why not try the ddle West for the winter ? Healthier , cheaper than New ark , and more background for the novel . That evening the obstetrician motored up to take a look ilt " one of my prize patients " ( they were all his prize padents ) , and brought with him a doctor from St. Paul , Minneint.i . Timothy enjoyed the company of doctors . The modest general practitioners had an endearing tolerance toward life , and the lordly specialists were interested in Timothy 's wildest wet Illations , for that was their business , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . " It 's the last outpost of the east , as Minneapolis across the River is the frontier city of the west . It 's a fine city , with traditions and friendly people and beautiful homes . Why do n't you come out and see us sometime ? " " I think , " said Timothy speaking slowly , " I 'll take you up on that  --  in just about two weeks . " For reasons not completely clear to Susan , except that he wanted to drive the car all the way out instead of shipping it , Timothy had gone to St. Paul one week ahead , leaving her alone to put the house in order for the returning minister and his . family , and to acquire some further baby culture from the nurse , who was leaving and might return to the Virginia Taliaferros for all Susan cared . Susan was still weak from the operation and was terrified at taking full charge of Roger . Roger he now was , though true to her ante-nuptial belief , she had not allowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she walked down the station platform with the baby in her arms she was not singing " Tee-rains ! Travelin ' ! " Roger was attired in his first white silk bonnet and embroidered white cashmere coat , both so much too big for him that Susan feared he would slip through them . Her mother and brother and porters were trailing her with an ice-box , a water-  | proof bag containing " dipes , " her own luggage . They swarmed into the compartment . Her brother gave her a square lavender florist 's box . " Orchids ! From Mr. Ziegfeld , I know , glorifying the American Mother . Darling , you ca n't imagine how these set me up , " and she pinned the flowers on her left shoulder . " Mamma , do you think Roger will last until St. Paul ? " Frank had picked up the baby and was sitting quietly holding it . Now and again he would touch the soft cheek with his forefinger , well-manicured of nail but with nobby joints from his apprentice days in the automobile factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coat and had wrapped the child in a woolly shawl . His cheek brushed the golden fuzz which was all Roger had yet in the way of hair . The two deep wrinkles between her brother 's brown eyes had smoothed out . Susan was in the presence of tragedy . " Frank , I wish you were coming with me . You handle that infant a darn sight better than I do . I say , if I can find you a job in St. Paul , will you come out ? And if it fails , I 'll pay you nurse 's wages , with bed and board . " The porter put his head in the door . " Train about starting . " Frank gave the baby to Susan , who hoisted him on her shoulder opposite the orchids , and followed her family to the platform . There was a confusion of hugs and kisses , and then she was alone with this stranger whose needs she only half knew . Back in the compartment she bolstered him up in one seat while she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entertain him . " Midget , why ca n't you speak ? It would help so , " and then the train lurched and the baby lurched with it and Susan barely caught him in time . " Oh ! " her heart was still within her . " My treasure , the best place for you is on Mother 's lap . And now for that damn schedule ! But I must n't excite myself or it will be bad for the  | k , and then he 'll have colic and then what will I do ? Oh was a pig to let me do this all alone ! ... If only evening ; Would come and we could go to bed . " Evening did come , and the lower berth was made up . Roger was ready for the night though the movement of the train had made every detail of his toilet an exhausting task . She fastened him under the covers with safety pins , wondering how her highly sterilized son would survive this exposure to foreign germs , and pushed two little chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she dared to arrange herself to go to the dining-car . She was bedraggled and felt like the peasant mother of ten children . Perhaps if she wore the orchids which were sloshing about in the metal basin  --  men always stare at women with orchids perhaps their stares would make her feel better . In the dining-car she ordered the food which was best for the baby 's nursing and tried to eat quietly and slowly , but she had only one thought : " Was Roger at this moment lying bleeding and dying on the floor ? " She could not stand it another second . " Waiter , my bill , please , and quickly ! " Through " Onteora " and " Minnewaska " she flew , thrusting open the heavy train doors as if they were gauze . A , B , C , D , E ? this was hers . There he lay asleep  --  or was he dead ? She leaned close to the soft red mouth , laid her hand on the little breast . " Oh my baby , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She washed herself sketchily , undressed , and lay down beside him . They both slept , until she was awakened by the laughter of men in the next compartment . They were playing poker and drinking . If they would only not wake the baby . Roger opened his eyes . This was not his nursery . And what was Mother doing in the same bed with him , and what were all these noises and shakings ? He did n't like it here . His face puckered . " Oh he is going to cry ! What shall I do ? Perhaps he is wet ? No , he is n't . Nurse said not to lift him up . Please ,  | darling , do n't cry . What will the men say about us next door ? Howling brat ! You do n't want to be called a howling brat , do you ? " Susan took him in her arms and began to rock him . He was n't used to being rocked and he did n't like that either . If she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd plunge it in his mouth . Dare she , dare she , at eleven o'clock at night , nurse him ? She tried it . He stopped crying instantly , in a few minutes ceased nursing , and smiled . Back in bed they both were again . The men were still playing and laughing . The wind from the ventilators blew on her bare shoulder . Cinders fell on the coarse white sheet . The acrid taste of smoke was in her mouth . She was feeling snivelly ; she would have a cold in the morning . How was she going to stand it for thirty-three more hours , with that awful change in Chicago ? Suppose , suppose with all this worrying of hers and series of frights something should happen to her milk ? " Dear God , please , please do n't let me go dry ! "  | CHAPTER XV , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Hales were giving an eggnog party to St. Paul . A large hall hung with ropes of evergreen and with a broad curving stair of lustrous wood ; a spacious drawing-room with French windows and brocaded walls ; a Colonial dining-room with Sheraton chairs backed against white paneling ; a breakfast-room of cushioned wicker and Boston ferns ; and beyond a kitchen and pantry as scientific in its equipment and sanitation as a laboratory ? a fine house for a Christmas party ! Susan in black velvet with lace frills of inherited rose point stood at the entrance of the drawing-room . Three pretty young women without hats were receiving with her . Two more guarded the punch and egg-nog bowls in the diningroom . Timothy was everywhere . He adored parties . It was thirty below zero outside , and the guests were arriving in great fur coats and galoshes . One white-haired woman in an old-fashioned sable cape was saying to Susan : " What an inspiration for you to give a party Christmas afternoon , Mrs. Hale ! We 've all had our relatives to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . I can not digest relatives or dinner in the middle of the day , can you ? " Said the next guest : " Sue , do n't forget we are all meeting at your house on Tuesday to read our parts for the new play . I am still all of a twitter over the success of the last one . Do n't  | you think you could persuade Tim to take a part this time ? His extemporaneous speeches are divine ! " " I know , but he would hate learning a part and having to go over and over it . But you 're so pretty , perhaps he 'll do it for you if you ask him . " Out of the corner of her eye Sue was watching Tim near the punch bowl introduce a millionaire industrialist to a secretary of the Farmer-Labor party . What a risk ! " Yes , Mrs. Schaeffer , Fraulein has been marvelous with Roger . I am so- grateful to you for suggesting her . Such loyalty , so competent . I never worry a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is there ? " Susan glanced back at the punch bowl . All three men were lifting their glasses in the air  --  drinking to the millennium ? She sighed with relief . A bony woman with pince-nez was nailing Susan to the wall with her questions . " Can you give a whole day to the Red Cross ? A half dxy ? Two hours ? The point is we must be able to count on you . " " And that is the one thing I am afraid you ca n't do , Mrs. Knowlton-Smith , at least not for a little while . I have a teenytiny baby . " " Oh ! " A pause . " Can you knit ? " " Not a stitch . I do sound helpless , do n't I ? But as soon as this routine is lifted I 'll report to you . I 'm a two-finger wonder on the typewriter . " Susan smiled appealingly . " We have trained stenographers for that sort of thing . " Susan , dismissed , thought of her magazine years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hands to help us win the war . ... Uh , by the way , I hear you have a German nurse for your baby . Are n't you afraid ? " " Of what ? " Susan blinked her eyes . Mrs. Knowlton-Smith lowered her voice . " Spies . Everywhere . Ground glass in your baby 's cereal .... Do you let her  | we the telephone ? You ca n't be too careful . Watch her is my advice , or better still , discharge her ! " Was the woman demented , or did the war do things like that to people 's judgment ? Susan had the prize baby nurse of St. Paul , and other women had envied her luck in obtaining her . Ground glass in Roger 's cereal , Roger whom Fraulein adored , about whom she would telephone when she took her evenings out , " Is de boy in bet ? Did he eat his supper gut ? Did you vash his eyes mit de boric acid ? " Fraulein whose favorite endearment was " Du , du , mit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how would you and friend husband like to go in a farm sled out to the Club at White Bear tomorrow night ? We 're having them open the place just for us and we 'll have a great fire and cook wienies and coffee and dance and have a helluva good time . About twenty of us . Whadyuh say ? " The essence of Rotarian good fellowship was asking this question . " Have you asked Tim ? " " He said to ask you ? you were the boss . " " Could I call you up tomorrow morning ? It sounds like a wonderful party and I do hope we can come . " This was one of those parties which Susan felt ought to be discussed before accepting . Reviewing this cross-section of St. Paul social life , drinking itself slightly sick on egg-nog this Christmas afternoon , it seemed incredible that the Timothy Hales had only been living there three months . The surgeon acquaintance of the summer had been more than welcoming , they had had letters , and an author whose stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarity . But St. Paul was a conservative city to which one came because of business or friends , not as a winter resort , and perhaps if it had not been wartime the Hales would not have been so quickly welcomed . But it was war-time , and far though St. Paul was from the  | Marne and Ypres and Chateau Thierry , and almost as remote from embarking soldiers and submarine scares , this city had created for itself an inland patriotism and a breaking down of barriers to all who were not Germans . Their recoil to Americanism was sharper because of the strong German element in the city . With the luck which was consistently theirs for many years , the Hales had been almost given the charming house they were living in by its owner , a gentleman who was earning his dollar a year in military Washington . The very new baby was an insurance of their respectability and also excused Timothy , as " sole support of a household , " from enlisting . Later it seemed to Susan that the Christmas party was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be suspect . First it was the German nurse whom Susan refused to discharge . Then people remembered that all were not Republicans whom they had met in the Hale drawing-room . The Little Theater movement in which they had been active died in the arms of the Red Cross  --  it was more fum ) to dress in white veils than mummers ' costumes . But it was at a Sunday night supper when the Hales stood forth in their true colors . In the steep banks of the Mississippi River , caves had been hollowed for the growth of mushrooms . St. Paul mushrooms were famous and cheap , and St. Paul ate its own mushrooms . Mushrooms with wild rice , grown by the Chippewa Indians on Minnesota reservations , was a regional dish as tasty as the bouillabaisse of Marseilles or tripe a la mode de Caen ? if you like tripe . A casserole of mushrooms was a savory and frequent course at Sunday night suppers , and it was mushrooms in this guise that the Hales were eating when their host applauded the throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violinist , in Youngstown , Ohio . Timothy laid down his knife and fork . " Have you ever heard Kreisler ? " he asked quietly .  | " Every time he comes to the Twin Cities , " his host anowed proudly . " And you enjoyed hearing him ? " " I have every one of his records on the victrola ! " " And yet you are glad to hear that this man whom you admired so much has been stoned ? " " That 's got nothing to do with it . We are at war and Kreisler is sending American money to help our enemies , the wounded Austrian soldiers . " " I do n't agree with you . " Timothy was struggling not to sound angry . " Kreisler is first of all a musician , then an Austrian . Art is above nationalism . It knows no country . I seem to have read that Kreisler is sending money to artists who happen to be soldiers and whose families are destitute . Surely that is a fine thing ? " Timothy was pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an enemy .... How about some more mushrooms ? " " They are too delicious , " exclaimed Susan . " Is there something special you put in the sauce ? " . She tried to fill the breach but she hoped Tim could feel that she was standing close to his shoulder . The Hales left early . They were never asked to this house again , and before lunch next day three different friends with German relations telephoned begging them " for God 's sake shut up or you 'll land in Leavenworth . Every one 's a little crazy now , no matter which side he 's on . You ca n't argue about patriotism . " The novelty of being a Solid Citizen had worn off for Timothy , and also it seemed as if the long Minnesota winter would never end . Grass and daffodils appeared only to be covered once more with snow . The novel now dwelt in two bulky red envelopes . Timothy was restless . This time it was Susan who suggested that Tim leave  | early and drive the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she . " Stop off and see your father and then scout around for a summer place by the sea ? I hunger for it after the prairies , do n't you ? " With Timothy gone , and by avoiding all war talk and appearing at the Red Cross twice a week where she rolled bandages very badly , Susan was re-adopted by St. Paul . When June came Susan packed trunks , replaced broken dishes , drycleaned everything in sight , watched Fraulein , tears in her faithful eyes , pack the traveling ice-box with jars of cooked cereal and vegetables which Susan was to heat for Roger en route , and discovered that she was leaving a city in which she might most happily have made that home she craved and which she was beginning to wonder if she ever would achieve . The twilight before her departure as she sat exhausted among yawning bags only to dart up to see if clean paper had been laid in the guest-room drawers and fresh soap in all the bathrooms , there was a great ringing at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing , so Susan , tucking in her blouse at the back and pushing her untidy hair back from her forehead , answered the bell . What appeared to be a crowd of familiar faces above arms full of packages burst into the hall . " We 've come to dinner , " they announced . " But , darlings , the cupboard is bare ! I 'm probably dining tonight on a hunk of stale bread and a sardine . " " Oh no , you 're not ! " and out to the breakfast-room they marched and on the table dumped wicker hampers and cardboard boxes . Susan was infinitely touched and tried to rise to the surprise , but she was so tired . The former chairman of the Little Theater  --  and meeter of all deficits of same  --  commanded : " Sue , your face is dirty . Go upstairs and wash it , and do n't come down for fifteen minutes . "  | What treasures they all were ! Oh why could n't she and Tim have stayed here ? They would n't miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ran back and forth with the most complete casualness , saying they adored the train journey for it gave them a chance for a long sleep . She looked in the nursery , dismantled now of everything except the borrowed crib  --  and Roger . He was still awake and grinned at her when she leaned over the rail . " Old bum , tee-rains tomorrow , travelin ' , " and Susan wept .  | CHAPTER XVI , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , SHE WAS to weep again and again that summer . Timothy had found a house on Cape Cod belonging to an old Greenwich Village friend , at least he had seen pictures of it , and Susan had to admit the place photographed delightfully . Nevertheless she started on the tedious journey with her growing establishment  --  Bohemian trained nurse , Hungarian cook , the ice-box , and Roger  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a new house copied after an old one , gray weathered shingles and rambler roses , and a sweet little garden looking out to sea . The interior ran to orange curtains and painted furniture so that Susan felt as if she were living in a tea-room , that at any moment a waitress would appear with a plate of cinnamon toast . Upstairs the bedrooms were divided from each other by partitions so thin a sigh could be heard , certainly a baby 's cry , and the nurse asked haughtily if there were only one bath . The city cook stared grimly at her choice of oil stove or coal range . 1 " I think you 'll be glad of the heat from that range , Josephine . I am told it is hot here only in the middle of the day .... Is n't it wonderful to be so near the beach ! We can go in our bathing-suits right from the house . " " I never go in bathing , " said Josephine . " Sue ! Sue , come up here and decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the large corner room , as always . " Just what did he mean by that ? The best bedroom in  | each of these furnished houses always was taken by her because so obviously it was designed for the mistress of the house . She had never thought about it , any more than offering to sleep in the upper berth on a train . Had he been silently resenting this all along ? " There are four corner rooms . Let us give the sunniest one to Roger , and you take the farthest from him . " Susan tried to sound casual . " There is n't going to be any farthest from anybody , the walls are like paper . How in God 's name can I write here ? And I have n't written a word in New York waiting around for you . " He was most certainly trying to start a quarrel . " I told you I thought it was a risk taking this place sight unseen , but we 're here and we 've signed the lease , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , but what about me ? Here am I the bread-winner and no decent quiet place to win the bread . " His voice was savage . " Tim , shame on you ! I 'm just as tired as you are . This whole household is waiting around for me to get them started , whereas all you have to do is to unpack your typewriter and ? " " And start working so this fancy household can start eating ! " Sue turned her back on him and went down to the kitchen . " Josephine , tell me what you need to get us through tonight and tomorrow breakfast . There must be a list around here of the tradespeople .... Yes , there it is on the pantry drain-board with the keys . See , they 've left some coal in the bucket . You start the fire , and we 'll all have a cup of tea as soon as I get back . " Upstairs she went again , ignoring Tim who was sitting in a chair at a window staring at the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ordinarily was his first concern , with the typewriter as the center of his universe . Timothy had once more motored ahead with the hand luggage and a new crib , so that the car now waited at the picket gate for Susan to drive off with the list of tradespeople . Tired though she was she found , as always , this contact with the men who were the bread and milk and meat of the community very satisfying . They were so permanent , so necessary , and she relished their concentration on her , regardless of whether it was from curiosity or self-interest . The tonneau of the car was full of brown paper bags when again she stopped at the gate . " Josephine , come help me bring these things in . I bet I 've forgot the salt .... Now let 's have tea . " Upstairs Timothy 's door was closed . Was he sulking or sleeping ? " Where 's that bad baby of mine ? " Roger was contentedly sitting on the floor chewing the corner of his little pillow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron crib by herself . " Nurse , you take the head and I 'll take the foot  --  this is a two-woman job . " ... The crib on its legs , Susan carried the baby off to her own bedroom . The new nurse eyed her . Was this Mrs. ILle going to be the interfering kind , and why did n't Mr. 1 late do something to help ? Susan stared out to sea as Timothy had , but the child was warm and sweet in her arms . " You 're going to have your first birthday on Puritan soil , Masttr Roger Hale , and what would you like ? Daddy will probably give you a book , if he remembers the day at all ? and I 'll give you a stuffed Miles Standish . " " See , see , " and Roger pointed to a windmill revolving in the breeze with a metallic whine . " Wind mill , " Susan repeated clearly and slowly , " say , wind mill , " and the baby tried to copy her . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Father loves  | T I is is such a complicated person  --  perhaps he is afraid the simplicity of the newly born . I thought we were going be so happy , the three of us , three old bums together instead two ? " " Tea is ready , ma'am , " called the cook from downstairs . " Thank you .... I wish servants said madam ' in this country .... Must tell Josephine not to shout . " With Roger in her arms Susan was about to knock at Timothy 's door . " No , better not intrude the nursery at this moment , " and she dropped Roger in his crib . Out of her bag she dragged a creased white flannel suit and a silk blouse which she had brought along as a safe adjuster to any climate before the trunks arrived . She refreshed face and hair , and hung over the banister of the stairs which gave directly into the living-room to see how the new Josephine had served the tea . The china was symmetrically arranged , there was a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and something under an inverted soup plate , toast , she hoped . Two chairs were drawn up to a low table upon which a tea-cloth had been draped . Josephine was competent ? teacompetent anyhow . Susan scratched at Timothy 's door . " Come in . " She could guess nothing from his voice . He was lying on the bed . " Could you get a snoozle ? " She hoped she did not sound falsely cheerful . " Tea is waiting downstairs . " His eyes were bloodshot ? sure sign he had been asleep . Over to the bathroom she stepped and returned with a towel damp with cold water . She bathed his eyes and wiped off his face . He dried it , and smiled at her . " I guess I was pretty tired . Tea sounds good . Be down in a minute . " Susan hurried back to the kitchen . " Josephine , the tea table looks- so inviting , but I think we had better have some  | fresh hot water . Mr. Hale is only just coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When Timothy appeared Susan was sitting at the low table . " You look , Sue , as if you had been pouring tea from that pot for years . You certainly have a feeling for rooms . It 's a darn shame you have n't a home of your own , you poor lamb . " Raspberry jam and olive branches . But one olive branch does not make a summer . America was getting down to the business of Winning the War , and any one who was not visibly and noisily doing his bit was a " slacker " or a " conscientious objector " or a " Bolshevist " or a " yellow dog . " The Hales were nearer the war here  --  German submarines were more indigenous to Cape Cod waters than to Minnesota prairies  --  and their cottage was surrounded by other cottages which contained wives and mothers of officers now in France , or manufacturers of porous gas-masks and concrete ships , or pacifist-baiting old maids . To the last especially it was heinous that an able-bodied young man like Hale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own selfish pleasure . Roger , with his golden fuzz changing to glittering curls , his fat legs staggering over the rough grass as he learned to walk , and Susan swapping recipes on the use of the new war flours , and on substituting honey and condensed milk for sugar , had a mildly disarming effect upon the patriots . But when an English major , who was also an author and an acquaintance of Tim 's publishing days , turned up as a guest of one of the old maids and presumably at their behest called on Timothy to rally him , with far too much r jocularity , on " what was he , old boy , doing for the Allies , " Timothy saw red and wanted to strike some one . Obviously not the major nor the Martian virgins . Susan was the only safe buffer . But could he rely on her ? Had n't he seen her pandering to those old hexes asking for their tasteless recipes and  | erring expansively to the Hale war work in St. Paul ? Sue tad rolled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pot even make a Liberty Loan speech ! He was an honest-toGod pacifist he was , and he hated all this dodging behind Susan 's skirts . Where was she now anyway ? Probably off in the car robbing some hen 's roost of an egg for Roger , or down on the sands playing with him . What was the nurse for ? ... Nor after dark was Sue much nearer to him  --  never been the same since those last weeks of pregnancy . The bathroom was also a sore point with Tim ? a litter of cotton swabs and sterile this and that , and always occupied when he wanted to go in ( how many times a day was that precious baby bathed ? ) , and the nurse always crackling past him in her starched white linen pretending not to notice he was still in his pajamas at eleven A.M. There did n't seem to be one congenial male on the Cape , and . their distance from New York made week-ending impossible , and when a guest did get there it meant doubling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the work was going well . He wanted to do just one thing ? get on with the novel  --  and a novel he certainly could not write in this Infant Welfare Center . Roger 's first birthday had come and gone , and Timothy had given the child a large picture book of barnyard animals with " Library of Roger Hale , No. 1 " printed in big letters on the cover . Very soon he could point to the horse and say " hoota " and to the cow and say " moo , " and though Susan permitted him to call his father " Daddy " she was firm about his enunciating " Mother " with no infantile variations . He could walk now and had several times gone off adventuring on his own . Labor Day marked the usual evacuation . The silk sweaters disappeared and there was a return of the native . Fishermen in hip boots gossiped at their own post office , and mother  | hubbards and gingham aprons were seen abroad . They were back in the old sea-faring days . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " suggested Susan . " All right , but I must get a room somewhere by myself , " and this he soon found over a village store . The city servants went back to the city and Susan took care of Roger herself while a sturdy Cape Cod girl cooked such superb chowders as they had not had all summer . Timothy became another man . No longer badgered by summcritcs , free to ignore the bedtimes and bathtimes of his son , away from the espionage , whatever the motive , of wife and nurse , he was once more the ardent young author working in a hall bedroom . The thoughts and notes which had been so long collecting flew into a cohesive whole like steel shavings to a magnet . It was an actual lark for Susan to call for him in the crisp late afternoons and take long walks past the reddening cranberry bogs and over the purple moors . Sometimes they played hooky from home and dined at a Portugec fish shop and went to the weekly movie . Ile would bring back ten pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log fire , now a necessity , she read and made notes on the margins , and ringed words which were repetitious , uninspiring , inexact . Like all authors he had his favorites : little , wonderful , suddenly , of course , well , oh , silken , seem , silver , look , very . These marginal comments they discussed and the behavior of the characters who grew more real to them every day .... They went to the white steepled churches on Sunday , for local color , but also because they liked being neighborly and enjoyed shaking hands with the minister on the way out . ... He came to her bedroom at night with less sense of the intruder .... They were closer together than they had been since the days of their Ford adventure .  | CHAPTER XVII . o r o 1 1 , , , 1 , 1 , , , , , , , , , 1 , , 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 , , , , , MID-OCTOBER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think it 's simply wonderful the independence you authors have . Not being tied down to a house , a job , a family . Just pack up the old typewriter and off to some new place . Though I suppose now that you have the baby it will make a lot of difference . " How many times had Susan heard this , and was to hear it . It was true . They were freemen in a world of slaves . So far the coming of Roger had made no difference to their wandering and she could see no reason why it should . Her morning broodings on the Spuyten Duyvil sleeping-porch , her fear of the mob 's censure in St. Paul and on Cape Cod , had momentarily intimidated her and she had wanted to hide within her own four walls and make her family safely standard . But those last happy autumn days on the Cape had freshened her spirit as well as Tim 's and she was ready to squeal once more , " Timmy darling , tee-rains , adventuring ! " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to another . You were without responsibility from an insurance point of view and yet acutely responsible in regard to inventories . You cherished your temporary possessions not because you loved them but because ultimately you might have to pay a stranger sums of money for the replacement of articles which you would never see again . You hoped you were not too obvious in snatching up moist cocktail glasses which careless males laid on mahogany pianos to leave their  | rings of alcoholic ruin , or in pouncing on stubs of dying cigarettes gouging hollows in tables of Spanish oak . Poor little Roger at an early age was inculcated with a deep respect for the property rights of others . He was to hear an everlasting " Darling , do n't jump on Mrs. A. ' s sofa . You 'll break the springs and then Mother will have to have it repaired .... Please , Mouse , do n't kick the doors open ! It damages the paint , and what will Lady B. say ? ... Oh , angel , how could you spill the medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain will never come out . " Susan often recalled that day when she shocked Timothy by nicking the bridal furniture with his penknife to make it more familiar . If ever again she had a home of her own she would have an orgy of nicking .... Orgy  --  what a funny word . " Wild and wanton revelry , Bacchic rites , " said the dictionary . A silly limitation ? naked ladies , gentlemen in long white dresses with vine leaves in their hair , wines in assorted goblets , stuffed peacocks , and sick in little bowls . Anything could be orgiastic . Susan knew a man who said his idea of an orgy was to polish his shoes , polishing and repolishing to a dazzling brightness . As their income grew so did the size of the house they rented . House-hunting became a favorite sport and Susan most proficient . She had only to look at the paint on the front door , the color and hang of the window curtains , to know whether or not she wished to descend from the renting agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of landlords an illegal quantity of silver and linen and goodwill that awed even the renting agents . But even so there were always the same old purchases to make : brooms and brushes of various shapes and fancies ; cloths to rub this and that ; yellow kitchen bowls , double-boilers , wire-strainers , and coat hangers  --  how many had she bought at the end of ten years ? Their single large wardrobe trunk , two bags and a typewriter with which they had started on their journey to  | St. Augustine had multiplied . Most cherished now was a strong fiber trunk which carried thermos bottles , tennis rackets , St. Paul ice-skates ; electric iron , percolator , and toaster ; a silver muffin dish , some pieces of brocade , little pillows for Susan 's bed , cigarette boxes , ash trays , leather-framed pictures of her handsome father and mother which gave distinction and an air of " family " to any drawing-room , and a red lacquer bowl which a professor had given Tim at Harvard . Susan had a way of spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each new house in a few days took on her personality . Timothy 's room , on the other hand , never looked like Timothy . It might have been any man 's room , not even necessarily a man 's , for he was as neat about putting away his clothes as he was in putting away his thoughts in the gray note-books . He did like to have his red lacquer bowl on his dressing-table to hold the current shirt studs , and was quite angry when visitors dropped ashes into his one treasure . Timothy was charmed by Susan 's ability thus to rechauffer herself . In a hotel bedroom if they were to remain in it I more than two days , she would slip out for a bit of shopping , and back she would come with arms full of flowers , books , some thrilling pastries . These arranged and the nest of ash trays scattered about ( for Timothy smoked more and more as the tension of his life increased ) , she would telephone for tea or coffee , and call to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Susan genuinely loved her servants . Tim said it was because they , in their recognized inferiority , pandered to her vanity . It may have been true , but the fact was they all loved her , never stole time nor silk stockings from her , and were in tears when she left them . Susan always played fair : she rewarded them for odd services with smiles and dollars and shillings and lire , and respected their legitimate holidays . She made them feel their jobs were honorable , that the man or maid who answered her front door was in reality Mrs. Tim-  | othy Hale greeting a guest , and as such must have graciousness of manner and cleanliness of cuffs . As the Hale comings and goings usually were in the autumn or spring Susan was constantly being cheated out of gardens . Hopefully in the autumn she would plant bulbs , but before the daffodils had a chance to show their yellow heads the luggage would be staggering out the door . By the time they were settled in their summer home it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " sugar corn , " and they were gone before the frost gave color to the chrysanthemums . On the day of leaving Susan would visit each room , lay affectionate hands on beds , smile at the china and glasses , and sit down in all the chairs , patting certain ones in which she had rarely reposed and regretting her neglect . " What a nice chair you arc ! I 'm sorry I did n't sit in you oftener . And now I shall never see you again . " Spanish influenza descended upon America with all the stealth and virulence of a Medieval Black Plague . And around Boston people were dying fastest . The Hales knew they must fly from the Atlantic seaboard , and the now familiar Middle West became for them a sanctuary . One cold October dawn they arose , atc their breakfast by electric light , bade farewell to their Cape Cod cook , and with side curtains up and Susan and Roger huddled in a blanket beside Timothy , they drove through sleeping villages until they had a second breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into the restaurant . He brought coffee and fried egg sandwiches out to Susan , who fed Roger from his sterile ice-box . That long drive to In what towns did they stay that winter ? that summer ? The early months were a blur of terrified suspicion , of avoidance of public places , of an actual discouragement of friend-  | ships . When they had to take a trolley , they sat at an open window and if any one coughed they left the car at once , frowning angrily at the offender . Yes , yes , of course , there was the Armistice , and then Susan had her appendix removed , and Roger graduated from diapers into drawers . The Hales had never felt so remote from community life . They were glad the war was over , but as they had had no relatives to profit by or die for The Cause , as they belonged to no organizations , they continued to remain lone wolves watching the pack . The novel had hardly been touched for six months , for these transcontinental dashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bills therefore had to be paid with remunerative short stories . Discontentment was upon Timothy ; also he was suffering from an over-feminized existence . He wanted men who would sit and wrangle pleasantly over two-hour lunches or go for walks at five in the afternoon . But Rotarians were too busy for that sort of thing , and writers there were none . Writers live in Chicago and New York or reclaim Connecticut farms ? and live in Chicago and New York . After the twenty-four-hour suspense of the operation and Susan faced a painful month of recovery , she and Timothy secretly enjoyed their separation from each other . He liked being completely master in his own home , and she reveled in her lazy dependence on hospital routine , though both looked forward to Timothy 's afternoon visits with books and magazines and mail and lil sprises . Rarely flowers . Timothy never thought in terms of flowers . Often as he sat beside her high hospital bed , stealing titbits from her supper tray , he would read her his day 's work . " Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped lying to him . A deathbed scene . He must remember her last words . Would it be Dick , I love you ' or Promise me you will never marry again ' ? How ugly she looked in her hospital shirt . Would she become calm and beautiful after death , as they said ?  | Death rattle , horrible words , must he hear it ? He wanted to run away , but he could n't with the doctor and nurse watching . Her hand holding his was unpleasantly moist . The shadows on her face were changing from violet to a washed green , she ? " " Timmy , stop it ! How dare you ! Is there nothing sacred to a writer ? I am sure these were your very own sensations last week when I was lying here immediately after the operation . Oh you make me feel so exposed ! " " Susie darling , I was a fool to read you that passage at this time , but you must realize a writer is always a writer no matter what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come out of the anesthetic I was only conscious of how much I loved you and how without reason life would be without you to show things to , whether it was a cut finger or my lil writings , or the Taj Mahal some day . Yet all the time I must have been watching you impersonally and the result has appeared on this sheet of paper . Has it occurred to you that I may he a much more understanding husband just because I have this writer 's capacity for observation ? In fact , come to think of it , you 're darn lucky to have a man around who is willing to talk to you about most anything , the cook , the dressmaker , the new chintz covers , your soul , instead of patting you on the shoulder and patronizing you with There , there , little woman , run along . I have more serious things to think about . ' " Susan laughed grudgingly . " I suppose you 're right . But you 're darn lucky , too , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , smarty , the doctor taught me that ) , and a pair of fine large ears which bring you back all sorts of verbal treasures .... In fact , we 're both swell and destined by the devil for each other . " The next day Timothy brought a stranger to her bedside . " Meet my new publisher , " said he with a flourish of the  | hand . " Mr. Darcy , of Darcy , Loose and Co . My poor appcndixless wife . " Susan wished Tim had given her warning so that she could have prettied herself , and shook hands a bit stiffly with a slender dark man , with thick black hair attractively streaked with gray , and with the longest eyelashes in the world . " He ca n't be a good publisher with eyelashes like that , " Susan thought , but the eyes behind the eyelashes were steady , the smile quiet and assured , and the handshake just right . " What does my husband mean , Mr. Darcy ? " " Precisely what he said , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , and we are eager to get new young people . By which I do not mean that Mr. Hale is a novice ? I have been enjoying his short stories for years  --  but from what I have seen of the new novel which he has shown me , I feel that he is going to do something that will be a complete departure not only from his own work but from anybody else 's work in America . And because we are new and eager ourselves , and our list is purposely still a small one , we think we can do more with this book perhaps than some more well-established house .... Do you think you can help him get it finished so we can publish it in the autumn of 1920 ? " His smile was warmer . " Tactful fellow , " thought Susan , but nevertheless pleased by his appeal . After Mr. Darcy and his eyelashes had gone , Susan fell upon Timothy with questions , sitting up in bed so sharply she almost reopened her wound . " I know Pudnut 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well , and the length and subject of this one will paralyze them . This fellow Darcy has courage and talks of the honor of publishing it . He 'd been hearing about the novel so he stopped off on his way to California especially to see me . He told me about their plans for the other books they 're bringing out , showed me some of the jackets , well presented  | I thought and good publicity . ... Old lady , if I 'm to get this book finished when he wants it , it means a steady plugging and darn few short stories . After Darcy read some of the manuscript this morning he admitted there was n't a chance for serialization . Then I am afraid I am going to make some of the editors sore at me for taking cracks at their pet traditions  --  Home , Mother , and the Backbone of the Country ! But I got to write it , got to ! And only you , Sue , can help me . This means the strictest economy from now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel is a flop . Are you game ? " It was easier to face poverty for herself than for Roger , but ? " We 'll steal the baby 's milk and go on a nut diet , " she answered with a gallant smile , but her eyes were sad and she felt her weakness as she lay in bed . " What a good sport she is in big issues , " thought Timothy , rubbing her pale hand against his cheek .... " And she was a brick through all that war business . It 's only when strangers are sprung on her suddenly . Never forget the way she behaved that evening when I brought Chuck home to dinner . And that was n't the only time . Why I was actually afraid to bring itt Darcy without first announcing him to Her Majesty . If she 'd just learn to be easy and accept things , trust me more ? " Ile dropped her hand back on the bed . Susan did n't notice . She was staring at the framed photograph of Roger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 t 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 I/ 1 1 1 1 I 1 1 " STRICTEST ECONOMY " kept them in small towns in the Middle West with occasional swoops on New York when plays with original companies , Lynnhaven oysters , and conversation seemed the end-all of existence . The novel was well in hand though not yet ready for the publisher , when the shuttle of their restless lives carried them to Washington in the early autumn of 1920 . They wanted to be near New York yet not in it , and the nation 's capital was a logical choice for itinerants like themselves . To find a furnished house was comparatively easy , renting houses being one of the chief industries of Washington , made so by the floating diplomatic , congressional , and bureau population . After the Armistice the dollar-a-year men had fled back to their larger incomes , pretty women had reluctantly taken off their uniforms and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a shortage of houses rentals had begun to drop . This was to Susan 's advantage , though at first the renting agents , impressed by her hats and English accent and the magazine reputation of her husband , could not believe she meant a low rent when she asked for it . Their first question was : " Do you want a house to entertain in ? ... This diningroom , Mrs. Hale , will seat forty comfortably . These three rooms can easily be thrown into one for a reception . Have you noticed the parquet floor ? excellent condition for dancing ? You see this coat closet in the hall is most convenient ? it could hold fifty top hats and overcoats without confusion . "  | ... And upstairs the bedrooms would be sparsely furnished and cheerless . These real estate men were charming fellows , gay-mannered , and full of Washington chit-chat . They seemed to take only one thing seriously ? closets . On every floor they would throw back doors with a triumphant arm and exclaim upon the number and size of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , " I do n't care if there are no cupboards ! I am not going to live in them ! What interests me are kitchens and beds . " The agent looked hurt . " We thought all women cared about closet room . " " Well , this woman does n't . " Hcr presence at the hotel had been announced in the Washington Post . " Mrs. Timothy Hale is here for a few days looking for a house with the intention of spending the winter here with her family . Mr. Hale , who is well known as a short story writer , is engaged upon a novel , some of the scenes of which arc to he laid in Washington . " Telephone messages instantly ensued from women who said they had met her in Seattle , San Francisco , Cincinnati , and would n't she come to lunch tomorrow ? Flattered , she would accept only to find that the lady from Seattle had a friend who wanted to rent her house so that she might go to the Riviera with a clear conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurking in the chicken patty ? Into a spot of a house they eventually moved , with a mahogany-and-chintz drawing-room , a sunny nursery , an excellent gas stove , practically no closets and colored people living two doors away . To write in , Timothy found a furnished room ten blocks off far enough removed from home to give him a pleasant walk after breakfast and yet not too far to encourage him to loaf about the house and then in high virtue to leap into a taxi .  | The Hales liked Washington at once . It was a friendly city , friendly from the moment the colored porters took their bags at the Union Station . People actually called and left cards , and no one dined in a restaurant . During the season in the northwest section of town there was a pervading sense of festivity . From lunch-time on , one became conscious of white gloves , or , rather beige and pale gray . A card-case was as necessary as a powder-compact . In later years with each fresh packing of her trunks , Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box containing copper plates and white cards . The cards were growing more softly sere and yellow , should she throw them away ? But no-o-o , perhaps they might go back to Washington some day . The newspaper men of the city welcomed Timothy as a man who always made a modest point of reminding them that he had been fired from every newspaper he had been on . It was consoling and heartening to meet a successful brother who had been fired ? for to have one 's name featured alone on the front cover of the Saturday Evening Post was surely success ! Then there was the Cosmos Club , which Timothy was invited to join at once . " I adore that place , " he said to Susan . " Ca n't you see me sitting in a large leather chair smoking a small mild cigar and making expansive and highly inaccurate statements beginning with I do n't know whether I ought to repeat this , but some one in authority , some one very close to the President in fact , told me ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting to drop into that quiet place and talk with a Cabinet Member , a Secretary of an International Conference of American States on Conciliation and Arbitration , a manufacturer of Swiss chocolate , an explorer who had almost reached the top of Mount Everest , General Billy Mitchell of the Air Force . Or to invite Clare Sheridan , back from Russia and exotic in a Cossack 's fur cap ,  | to drink tea with him in the chill refinement of the Ladies ' Reception Room . And because Susan was learning to order an extra egg scrambled without too much forewarning , some of these would be brought back informally to the Hale home for dinner . Talk , talk , grand talk ! Clarence Darrow saying that all was not Chicago which racketeered , no , not quite all , as he smiled gently into his whiskey-and-soda . Fred Howe fighting for his immigrants as Commissioner of the Port of New York . Hendrik Willem Van Loon , playing his fiddle or doing card tricks or stating in bilingual terms that snoring had recognizable national characteristics  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will illoostrate ! " William Lyon Phelps drinking hot chocolate after a lecture , preparatory to taking the midnight train back to New Haven , and amused by Timothy 's collected data on hats . Mr. Phelps wore a soft hat of no particular shape , which when he entered the Hale hallway he crowded into his topcoat pocket , as if he were afraid of losing it or of having it taken away from him . Now William Hard had just such another hat ? a size too small and agreeably battered . So did Lloyd George and ( : lcmcnceau  --  small , warped , fuzzy hats . Surely it must mean something  --  something fundamental . Into their drawing-room squeezed financial advisors to small turbanned countries , navy commanders with their unfailingly pretty and coquettish wives , arriviste journalists with political or even diplomatic ambitions , witty , fragile boys from the State Department , delightful girls who had been ready to hunger-strike for God and Alice Paul . Dining at David Fairchild 's on soya beans which gave you a feeling of promoting his Foreign Plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkies gaped at the fantastic transformations of their tattered dwellings . At once stimulating and relaxing did Timothy 's tired  | mind find this intercourse , like cold water poured upon boiling coffee . Talk , talk , but not all of it was grand talk , and Susan often played the reluctant hostess . Any one Tim deeply liked , she liked , too , but he had so many twenty-four-hour enthusiasms that Susan , who was curious but not gregarious , failed often enough to glow with him , and thus she earned for herself in Tim 's mind that adhesive opprobrium " difficult . " She had seen some wives sit silent and admiring of their husbands ' every word , other wives cast adoring smiles the length of a dinner table . She rarely did either except when Tim was telling a story or making a speech , and then she listened with an aloof and critical ear . She had been the responsible chief of a family too long before she married to feel that there was either head or foot to the Hale dining-table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality ? had n't Tim married her because he thought so ? ? and she was ever fearful that in the strength of his , hers would be submerged , obliterated . Hence she must catch the attention of the stranger at once , impress him with her gaiety , her frock , her free thinking , so that later he would say , " Yes , I met Mrs. Hale just once but I see her in every page of his books . " Susan protested to Tim and to others that marriage gave you the confidence to be a wall-flower , without terror or fear of contempt , but actually she hated being left alone as much as any awkward debutante . On those evenings when others had not appreciated her wit and her new frock , poor Tim in the taxi home would have to pay for her neglect by listening to harsh criticism of the hosts , the guests , the food , the furniture , and finally some uncouthness of his . " You never watch out for me , Tim . You nab the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave me to shift for myself . What 's the use of having a husband ? " " That 's not true . As a matter of fact the only time you ever remember me is when you think you are deserted . You  | do n't have to be the center of attention every moment . It wo n't hurt you to sit quietly on the side lines once in a while . " But before Susan went to sleep she was sorry for what she had said , ashamed that she was acting like a comic-paper shrew , and would humbly apologize . Tim forgave her at once ? they both hated to go to sleep on a quarrel  --  but whereas with Susan to forgive was to forget , Tim added each new quarrel to the total of all quarrels and at each new offense Susan was guilty of one  --  and of all . If it was a stupid fact that Tim 's gregariousness was often a sword between them , it was a sad , though common enough , truth that Roger 's presence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at meals , was being brought up on the British code of children being occasionally seen and heard never . But should Roger enter the room in the middle of a speech by Daddy and Susan 's maternal eye wander toward her baby , or should she snatch him up in her arms for the pleasure of the feel of him , Timothy would stiffen and mutter , " You never pay the slightest attention to me when that child is in the room . " Like all triangles  --  insoluble ! So it was on their lone motor trips , their exploring walks , their sneaking off to movies at odd times , their dinners in Chinese restaurants , that they were happiest . When Tim would telephone " Let 's have a party , I ca n't write another word ! " Sue would fly into coat and hat with all the excitement of a girl meeting her best young man . She had learned to match her stride to his long one , with an occasional skip to catch even , and he would hold her hand inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug arms with delight at escaping from their respective jobs . He did not like the theater , hated being bound to its two-and-a-half-hour convention . Movies were better , no noise and free to leave at will . She remembered so well seeing with him " Broken Blossoms " with Richard Barthelmess as a young Chinaman and Lillian Gish as a cockney child . It was a revelation in what photog-  | raphy could do and pantomime convey . As the sordid yet spiritual story unfolded itself in the menacing shadows of a Limehouse night , Susan began to cry and held tighter to Timothy 's hand . " I ca n't bear it , Tim , I can not bear it . " " But , Susie blessed , it 's only a movie . Perhaps the girl wo n't die after all . " " Tim , it is n't that . It 's the shadows and the lighting , not the story . It 's so beautiful , I think my throat is going to crack . " Tim turned his head and stared speculatively at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I could feel the way you are feeling now . With a heart like yours plus my ability to write I 'd be the best known author in America . " Later . " No , Tim dearest , I do n't think I could bear a Chinese dinner tonight . " The novel was with them day and night . It sat down to breakfast with them , it was telephoned about during the day when Timothy wanted praise for an adroit situation or he could n't find the right word in Roget 's Thesaurus . Sometimes Susan would appear in his workroom with a thermos of hot coffee and doughnuts freshly fried , and the novel would make a third at the feast . Its presence faded at dinner , but if ? Timothy had brought home a dozen pages for Susan to read he would be distracted and even bad-tempered , accusing her of lack of interest , until she settled down on the sofa and started reading . He would hover about and watch her eyes go down the page , keen to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she laughed he 'd insist , " What was it ? what was it ? Was it a good funny ? " Sometimes the tears came . " It 's the scene where the baby dies , Timmy . I ca n't bear it . Must it die ? " Tim nodded , and his own eyes filled with tears . Susan wanted to ' rush upstairs and see if  | Roger were safe . Obviously Tim was only thinking of the baby in the book . Was he never voluntarily to go to the nursery to kiss Roger good-night ? He never had so far . Were all authors like Timmy ? Side by side they went over the dozen pages , he defending his points of view , his phrases , but more often quickly giving in . He was everlastingly grateful that she had been a magazine surgeon , who could cut and sew up wounded manuscripts and who knew printer 's signs and jargon , and because she had an instinctive sense of what was good literary taste . Nor was Susan safe during the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be during the day she had the virtue of waking easily and cheerfully . So when he came home late from some men 's dinner and wanted to talk , she would turn over with murmurs of welcome . He would have been hurt if she had scowled at him at six A.M. when unable to sleep , he would scat himself on the edge of her bed , cigarette already in his fingers , and awake her with : " I think I am making Malcolm too damn introspective ! He is much more the doer type than the thinker . I want Caroline to 1 ) c the neurotic . Now when he makes his first political speech it seems to me he ? " Susan pushed her curly hair back from her forehead and rubbed her eyes with her fists . Blinking she tried to absorb what lie was saying . " No one ever made a first speech , Tim , who was n't shaking with fright before he rose from his chair . And let the man make a good speech , a short speech for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good little spoocher one of these days , if you 'll learn to talk slower .... Anything else on your mind ? " Part of Susan 's effort at economy was to bring her mother down from Long Island , install her in a cheap boardinghouse nearby , and engage her as part-time nurse . Mrs. Brooke  | was more than willing , eager to be of use at an age when women resigned themselves to being useless , and she adored her grandson . The child was equally fond of her and the tall black maid-of-all-work , Carrie , who had been cook in a large establishment and knew more about Washington social life than Susan ever expected to know . Roger appreciated the simplicities of these two women , they were more his age than Susan was . Daddy he treated with cool respect . His walk had changed from a stagger to that precarious method of the very young whereby they seemed to proceed only on their tiptoes in their doll 's shoes and at an angle which threatens a fall at every step . His vocabulary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no baby talk and because he had a natural fondness for words . He was the Perfect Baby . The doctor had promised he would have his father 's length of limb , but just now he looked like neither of them . Curly golden hair , lots of it , rose-petal skin , luminous smile , well-proportioned body , and those quiet considering blue eyes which made Susan think of her father . He was a joy to dress , and more often than not was taken for a girl . Corn-colored and pale green linens , plaited frills and fine smocking he wore . He had no " best " clothes ? never very many , none reserved for special occasions , all pretty , and all to be worn . He was never nagged about being dirty . Susan felt that this was a prerogative of childhood and something to be enjoyed before society turned up its delicate nose at you . He was taught courtesy from the start , so there were no shoutings and spankings until one day in Rome when he was four and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished they might have had a bit more money just then for there were so many " firsts " to buy Roger . The first bean bag , crayons , blocks , fire engine , train , kiddy car , tricycle . When she read him for the first time " The Night before Christmas " out of the same illustrated edition she had  | loved as a child , she felt a religious glow . Christmas morning she presented him with a doll 's crib , curious to see what he would do with it , put his stuffed animals to bed in it , or what ? He did it once , then took the bed apart and used the slats and sides as ladders up which his animals climbed when he played " fire . " Boys were not girls , evidently . About this time psycho-analysis was becoming almost as popular in the drawing-room as mah-jong . It had seeped out of the German classroom into the studios of Greenwich Village where artists regarded it as evidence of their own tortuous thinking . It became a question-and-answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wit iv nit benefit of diploma , invented questionnaires which permitted still ved spinsters , wife-weary husbands , collegesubverted children , and other branches of the " sexually unemployed , " to spend happy and expensive hours talking about themselves . It was inevitable that Freud and Jung should steal into the nursery . Susan always kept on her bedside table one bulky volume , bound in black or dark blue and lettered in gold , on a subject Nvhich she felt she ought to read and rarely did . " The Montessori Method " nested on three successive tables . Wells ' " Outline of Ilistory " and Freud 's " General Introduction to Psychoanalysis " served their terms of dust-gathering . They were too heavy physically to handle in that delicious half-hour before tong to sleep at night , and too much like school-books to read during the busy days of endless , alive , entertaining chores for Timothy , Roger , and the servants , for Susan worked as hard for the happiness of her servants as she did for the members of her family . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sensitive plates upon which careless words , inadequate explanations of biological phenomena , could be engraved with such depth that the ultimate effect might be permanent phobias and maladjustments . She took every one of Roger 's questions seriously , trying to  | er truthfully but without giving undue emphasis by overplaining . One evening as he sat on his little enamel pot in the bathroom prior to going to bed he looked up at her mid said , " Mother , what is dying ? " How to explain ! He was only three ! But she had promised herself never to lie to him . " My treasure , it is going to sleep and not waking up again . " Sitting on his little pot , his white flannel nightie in folds about his bare feet , he was so very tiny to be told of such an overwhelming extinction . And he sensed it , for his blue eyes widened and filled with such a fear that Susan knew she had done something wicked to her first born . " Mother , Mother , you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never see you again ? " Oh , what had she said ! She knew that as his mother she was the one secure thing in his short life , and to lose her in an endless sleep was unthinkable . She knelt down beside him , holding him tight to her heart . Any , any lie must be told at once to wipe that horror from his sweet face . " Precious , Mother is too silly the way she says things . You know how you went to the hospital last month to have your tonsils taken out and how you went to sleep for a little while so that kind Dr. Nelson would n't hurt you , and how your throat was sore for a few days and you could only eat mushy things , and then you were all well again , and no more sore throats ? well , Dr. Nelson and other doctors are thinking all the time about ways to cure illnesses , and death is only an illness , and I am sure that soon they will discover a medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He nodded quite cheerfully , stood up to let her fasten his drawers in the back , and she tucked him into bed . " Tell me the story of ' Little Black Sambo , ' " he commanded . As she was kissing him a final good-night , she fancied he  | clung more tightly around her neck . Was he thinking that perhaps he might never see her again once he had fallen asleep ? Oh fool , fool , that she was , this nonsense about telling babies grown-up truths ! ... She left the nursery door open wider than usual and all through the night she would start up from her bed and steal to Roger 's crib and listen for his breathing . " I am the frightened one , not he , " she thought . " What 's the matter with you , Sue ? " grumbled Timothy from his twin bed . " Ca n't you sleep or have you Bright 's disease ? " I le hated to be disturbed once he was asleep . " Shhhhhh , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just restless . " It did not occur to her to share with him her agony . For weeks she waited for Roger to return to the subject , but he never did . His maturity at the age of twelve encouraged her one day to tell him the story . He was charmed with it as he was with all talcs about his early childhood , or hers . " I do n't remember it at all , Mother . I never think of death especially . When I am alone with myself or you are with me , then I feel nothing can happen to either of us . The only time I am afraid is when you go on a journey without me , then I am afraid for you . " Susan , at the age of twelve , had been in a Catholic convent , each day hearing about death in relation to heaven or hell , and the omissions and commissions which would surely merit either . It was not surprising that she should wake up then at three A.M. and feel engulfed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust , yet so small that this bearded Jehovah knew that she had wickedly skipped her prayers that evening because she was too sleepy from studying her next day 's catechism lesson . She resented the absorption of her identity by the infinite , she wanted to defy God and yell " I will not die ! " She equally wanted to die at once and have the waiting , the sinning and forgiving , all over . Roger , at twelve , had no religion . He went to a boardingschool where the bible stories were told as necessary history  | and he went to the Episcopal Church on Sunday because he liked the ritual intoned in a cultivated voice , the carved wooden quiet and embroidered banners , better than the freshscrubbed realism of the Congregational creed . Roger was not made to think daily of the tomb . Boys broke collar bones and legs in football and ski-jumping , but they always recovered in time to play baseball . " No , Mother , I never think about death . Except I feel like crying when sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living . But you really do n't mean that , do you , do you ? "  | CHAPTER XIX " GOD 'S OWN COUNTRY " was published February , 1921 . Timothy and Susan were not convinced of it until they had made a tour of the Washington book shops and department stores and had seen piles , cautious piles , of the book not too conspicuously displayed but nevertheless printed and exposed for sale . Tim looked tired , thin , his tall figure drooped , his hand shook when he lit a cigarette . If only they could go off somewhere in the car , Charleston , New Orleans , but they could not afford it , unless by some miracle the book was a success . They must wait and Timothy had small hope . The final typing had been a great relief , expensively and beautifully and surprisingly accurately done by a public stenographer . Then had come the yards , rods , miles , of proof . Timothy had read proof often enough on his own short stories , hut this finical , eye-straining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary that he felt no stranger could possibly want to follow him beyond the first chapter  --  this feeling alternating with excitement when he would skip ahead and read a scene here and a sentence there and mutter , " Pretty damn good stuff , if I do say so ! " Susan of course read proof after him , catching errors which it seemed incredible that he should have missed . Earlier there had been the submission of painted oblongs for covers and paper jackets , which they would stick up on the mantel , walk away from , then turn and scrutinize sharply to try  | to guess which would most attract the eye on a book counter . " Timmy , this wo n't be your last novel . Why do n't you decide upon a permanent binding and type , like Hergesheimer and Cabell , and keep it forever and ever , changing only the jacket ? It will give uniformity and dignity to your books like the ? like the Encyclopedia Britannica , " she laughed . Tim was not interested , not even mildly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired to fuss . When I wrote The End ' on that last page , I lost all interest . You and Darcy fix it up between you . Fact is , I bought some more gray note-books today and I 'm planning the next one . " Susan stared at him with an awe she only occasionally felt . He was not an awesome fellow , had no desire to be . Wanted to slop around in bedroom slippers and soft shirts , smoke as much as he liked , and find people on the telephone ready to come instantly to take a walk with him or discuss ? anything ! " Tim , do n't you think we had better subscribe to a clipping bureau ? " " What for ? Unnecessary expense . The best reviews , if any , will be sent me by Darcy , and the others do n't matter . " Two weeks after publication every critic , every columnist , in the country had something , and usually very much , to say in ecstatic praise of the new novel . Two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the subject of talk in every one 's mouth at formal dinners and sprawling literary teas . Susan subscribed to a clipping bureau . The novel had appeared at the psychological moment . A year earlier , a year later , and it might not have had its stupendous success . The Great War had dragged America out of her wilful hibernation , and blinking in the shadowed sun of a suffering world she began to wonder what she was all about . It had been some time since America had wondered about herself . Hardly since the Revolution . Then along came this  | young man and put her wonder into the vernacular of Main Street , into the wisecracks of the joiners ' clubs and Pullman smokers ; created , by minute docketing and through dialogue that entertained by its accuracy and humor , an uneasy stir in the reader who felt there was something significant behind the familiar spoken word . America heard herself as Paris and London heard her , and , caught unaware in her moment of humility , she read and read this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hales had a bay window in the drawing-room . The postman was due about eight-forty-five with the morning mail . At eight-forty the Hales , whether or not they were through breakfast , would begin feverishly to search for his gray figure down the street . " ' There he is ! " one or the other would call and rush to the front door for a bundle that was a grab bag of first prizes . Susan slit all the envelopes with a steel table knife , reserving only to herself what proved to be bills and advertisements . But she would comment : " An English stamp , and English hand-writing . H. G. Wells , doubtless , " she mocked . And then it was from H. G. Wells ! " Clippings , losh and losh of clippings . The Boston Transcript has given you a half page with that Arnold Genthe photograph . Is n't it impressive ! ... Oh Timmy ! In Heywood Braun 's column he says  --  he quotes  --  why it is a sentence I wrote for you , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope with the address written in pencil .... Tim ! That old wandering printer in Montana that we shared our picnic with one day ! The precious ! I do n't honestly think he likes the book much but he wants to be loyal .... " This is addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Hale . A card to dine at Countess Palatzka 's ? we are progressing .... Of course , I 'm thrilled to go . Her parties are always great fun , I hear . I 'd better have that white satin dry-cleaned at once ....  | " Ah , these dear old friends of mine . Here 's a letter from a girl who used to be on Fashion with me . I remember she Called me insane for marrying a man with no money and no future , but now she says she was conscious of your genius that one time she met you , and wo n't I lunch with her the next time I am in New York ? I bet she wants a job , because we certainly were never old collitch chums .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Timmy , stop reading a moment and listen to this , from Florence Martin , you remember she was Superintendent of something or other in Minnesota when we were there , a splendid person before whom I always felt most trifling-minded . She writes : ' Whatever else you 've done , dear Mrs. Hale , you 've done the biggest thing  --  given your husband a chance to get a second vision of life through a woman , and I believe that second vision makes a man an artist . I do n't know of anything that would make for more happiness than to teach a few more men and women that their quarrels are n't with each other , but just another part of that material world they 've got to make their way through to the thing I believe you 've found and that I hope I have : ... Tim , have I helped you to that extent ? I know I have with positive experiences like babies and operations and funny food and foolish laughter , but do you feel as if you knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue , I see life through you rather than around you , so ever present and satisfying are you . I begin to fear this lest it narrow my vision rather than broaden it . Perhaps in the future we shall have to take arbitrary vacations from each other so that I may look through other telescopes than my Susan . " " No , no , " she shook her head hard , " you do n't understand what I meant , what Florence Martin meant .... Look , here 's a letter for you with a Colorado postmark . Know any one there ? ... John Galsworthy ! " They stared at each other . The room was very quiet . " He writes he picked the book up in the hotel and when  | he had finished he felt he must write though he did not know me . He says ? " Susan was on her knees beside him and all the mail tumbled to the floor . They began to cry softly . " Susie darling , John Galsworthy ! " A full window display in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New York for interviews . From the beginning Timothy seemed to inspire interviewers . Perhaps because he could not brush his teeth or buy a shoelace or answer a telephone in the manner of any one else , the interviews were rarely dull . That he was to be misundertood and often maliciously misquoted was inevitable and the price of such meteoric popularity . But accurate or not , his statements were always startling , amusing , original . In most cases he really interviewed himself , and the men with the best memories delivered the best interviews . When Susan later , as the Great Man 's wife , was asked her expert opinion on wifehood , motherhood , dehydrating vegetables , and the servant problem , she must have absorbed her husband 's dynamics , for her remarks were also good reading  --  and slightly irritating . Why even young Roger was to be a victim of the American passion for asking questions of celebrities . This last was when the child was five and the reporters had come down the bay to meet the incoming Mauretania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wished to remain silent . " Boys , I have n't a thing to say . Interview my son here , " and one man with imagination , Burton Rascoe it was , turned to the articulate child and did get from Roger a series of amiable sentences , as amiable and valueless as those of any opera singer or returning congressman , and solemnly printed them in his literary column next day . The older members of the Houses of Hale and Brooke steeped themselves in the notoriety . Lawyer Hale showed the  | latest clippings to every client who came into his office . Mrs. Hale received gracefully the acclamations of her clubs and neighbors . Both daily denied that Timmy had drawn any characters from Bannerman . Frank Brooke in New York exhibited to his fellow automobile salesmen the full page ads of the book in the weekly literary sections . They were impressed by the good advertising and said , " Certainly must read that book right away , " and did n't . And Susan often wondered if Frank himself had ever got beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reflected glory of one near the throne . Roger could n't read and was more interested in ' small and breakable objects . Carrie , the cook , could n't read , but she knew the Hales were dining again next week at Countess Palatzka 's , and that a card had come for a White House reception . Darcy , Loose and Company were men enough to be grateful and not say " We told you so " but just went on printing thousands and thousands and packing same by day and far into the night . What Pudnut 's said , Timothy did not hear . The photographers were hot after the new quarry . Hardly a day passed that a too sweet feminine voice failed to deliver to Susan over the telephone her set speech : " This is the Overbrush Studio , and we should consider it a great privilege if Mr. Hale would come in for a sitting . Or we should be most happy to come to your house at any time convenient . Of course you understand you are in no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There were also the haughty portrait-painting photographers who did not telephone but whom you met at a party and who casually suggested that they thought they might get something of you that would be rather different . " Drop into my place about eleven tomorrow , why do n't you ? "  | " What shall I wear , Sue ? A high collar or a low one ? A bow tie or a four-in-hand ? You women certainly have the best of it when it comes to having a picture taken . I hope this man lets me pose myself . It 's always better . " Then appeared the lecture agent . Requests had been coming in from women 's clubs , he said , and he even thought he could fill the Town Hall in New York if Mr. Hale would consent . " How do you know I can speak ? " queried Timothy . " I hate to listen to lectures myself , and the few I have heard by authors were terrible . Except Hugh Walpole , who does a damn good job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the worst living actor ? ask the Little Theater in St. Paul . " " I heard you speak , Mr. Hale , at that dinner of the Authors ' League and you had them all going , " cajoled the agent . " Ye-c-es , that was n't too bad , " agreed Timothy , " but then I was among friends . " " ' These women 's clubs are most friendly , entertain you every minute , and I think I could get you three hundred a lecture , and probably more next year . " Three hundred dollars for an hour 's chatter , and an excuse to take a holiday ! " 1 'll have to talk to my wife about it . " The agent went back to New York satisfied . " Susie , would you think me a pretentious ass to give these lectures ? I have n't a thing to say , said it all in my novel , and I hate anecdotes . What do you think ? " " Darling , those kindly ladies want to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hear him . Most natural thing in the world . They suspect you of having a forked tail , wearing a red waistcoat , and perhaps a toupe ' . They want to be able to say they have spoken to you and shaken  | your hand . When they Find out what a nice lil feller you are they may be disappointed , but I do n't think so . You can he counted to shock ' em sooner or later , and in any case it ought to help the sale of the book . " " What about your coming with me ? Then they can see the author 's wife , too . " Susan chanted : " Wives of great men all remind us , they had best be left behind . " " Aw , come on . " " Urn-hum . I 'm sorry . I 'll cramp your style . Well , just once to see what it 's like , but no more . " With her mother and several , friends , and in her smartest spring clothes , Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Town Hall . The bill-boards proclaimed that Timothy Hale , author of " God 's Own Country " would lecture at three o'clock on " The New Realism in American Literature . " Women , hordes of women , and an unusual number of men , were pushing , yes , pushing not sauntering , into the hall , and all of them there to hear  --  and see  --  her Timmy . She was trembling as she preceded her guests up the stairs to the box which had been reserved for them . They made her sit in one of the rail chairs , though she wondered if Tim , spying her , might not be made self-conscious . What an enormous stage , doubly empty with only that reading-desk for furniture ! Would he speak too fast , would his voice carry , suppose he knocked over the water jug ? Would he And there he was , lunging as always , and then bringing himself up abruptly at the stand . There was applause . He bowed with a small smile and started unbuttoning his double , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Susan 's hands tore at each other in her lap . Quite simply he took out his watch  --  his Ingersoll watch which he continued to carry for several more years until one day in Lausanne it occurred to him that he might buy an  | expensive Swiss watch  --  and laid it on the stand . He looked around at the large audience as if he were in a drawing-room . The pause was more than dramatic . He buttoned up his coat again , smiled broadly , and said , conversationally , " Ladies and gentlemen , how do you do ... . There 's Franklin P. Adams over there on the aisle thinking to himself , Now what 's that poor fish , Tim Hale , going to say ? ' " Timothy came around from behind the stand , and added , " Frank , I am wondering just that same thing myself . " The audience laughed , craned to see Mr. Adams who had bowed gaily to Tim , and settled back in their seats with a pleased sense of having had another author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them .... And then he proceeded to say a good deal , and a very good , good deal , and his reputation as a lecturer was made . He was a nervous speaker in the sense that he moved about the stage , picking up and laying clown his watch , thrusting his hands in his pockets , blowing his nose , but the audience found his activities interesting as they would those of any actor , and they were not tortured with oratorical bombast or spacious meaningless gestures . At the end , a crowd , this time almost all women with a few anemic young men , surged down the aisles to the foot of the platform . Copies of his book were held up to be autographed , others grabbed at his long fingers , still others tried only to catch a smile from him . It is to be assumed that Franklin P. Adams had gone home . Susan and her guests were standing up in the box , uncertain whether to leave or wait for Timothy . Suddenly she became aware that the lingerers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timmy was waving at her . She waved to him . " Sue , I am coming in a minute , wait there for me , " he called and again the audience laughed delighted by his coziness in a public hall . He then bowed and disappeared . As they filed out they kept looking up at her , and she presented  | ' what she hoped was an unconcerned and fairly attractive profile , but actually she was the Princess Patricia graciously receiving the homage of her subjects . Susan was to hear Tim lecture often in the other cities they were temporarily to adopt , and to hear him speak after dinners until even her loyalty sagged , but only once did she accompany him on an out-of-town engagement and share with him the honors that only a woman 's club can bestow . They were met at the station by a limousine so large and polished it looked like a hearse . It proved not to be the car of Mrs. Pruyn , the fluttery little president of the club , but had been borrowed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady Mxcenas of the town had also offered to put up the Hales overnight , but the little president had jealously determined the honor should be hers . " If you do n't mind  --  the train was late ? we had best go directly to the hall where you are to speak  --  there 's a place to wash there ? I hope you are not tired , Mrs. Hale ? is this the first time you 've been in our city ? " Susan and Timothy were both tired but obviously there was no alternative . People loitering in the vestibule watched them with interest as they were hurried through and down the side aisle to the small room to the right of the platform . Timothy washed his face and hands , vaguely gazed about for a lavatory , did n't see one , asked Susan for her comb , and smoothed his crinkly hair not so yellow now as when she had married him . Susan did the usual things to her face , pulled her Suzanne Talbot ( the original , said the label inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted approvingly her new frock of light and dark blue taffeta . All this while Mrs. Pruyn , watch in hand , would dash to the side door for a whispered conference or peep out to see how fast the hall was filling . " It 's four-fifteen now , Mr. Hale . I think we might go on .  | Mrs. Hale , will you sit in that chair next to the lady with the tall feather in her hat ? " and to her amazement Susan found herself being propelled on to the platform instead of sitting . in the hall below . Timothy sat clown in a creaking wicker chair near a low table where stood the lecturer 's emblem  --  ice-water pitcher and glass . Susan knew Timothy preferred a high reading stand as something easier to lean on , and over . The little president had most certainly written out her introduction but her eyeglasses had become entangled in the laces of her dress , and desperately she blurted : " Ladies and gentlemen , members of the Allerton Woman 's Club : unl their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hale 's God 's Own Country . ' He needs I think no further introduction . l Ie will speak on  --  uh  --  on  --  uh  --  Mr. Timothy Hale ! " Which after all was what Timothy did . Susan was n't worried about Tim this time , she was more concerned with keeping her skirt from riding up when she crossed her legs . Though she knew her husband was holding the audience 's ears , she knew also that there were many eyes focussed on the clothes of the author 's wife . Her skirt was awfully narrow , she simply must not cross her knees , and it was agony not to cross them . The back of the wooden folding chair bit into her spine . Her nose itched . The hall grew hotter . The large lady with the feather smelled stuffily of perspiration . Tim was talking too fast now . If she could only get his eye , and mouth the word " slower . " Oh ! he was going to sit on the low table . Well , why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat ? Timmy was referring now to his long legs , his fondness for water  --  taking a drink ? and to " his amiable wife sitting over there so proud of her brand new hat . " The audience tittered . The personal allusions always did the trick . He was through , and the little president was being elbowed aside by the large lady with the feather . Some one  | thrust an unwieldy bunch of pink peonies into Susan 's arms , and she found herself standing between Tim and the large lady on a receiving line . The hall began to serpentine toward the short flight of steps at the side of the platform . " Is this the first time you have been in our city , Mrs. Hale ? " " Wonderful to have such a success so young . " " Do you write yourself ? " " Have you any children ? " " Is he going to be a writer , too ? " " Do you also come from Ohio ? " " Just how many thousands has the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each copy . " " Does Mr. Hale write his stories by hand or does he dictate them ? " " I 've always wanted to be a writer myself , but I just never seem to find the time . " Susan 's face was stiffening into a grimace . Her nose she knew must be shining , and the green of the flowers was coming off on her light suede gloves . But what was infinitely worse , the idiot who had handed her the bouquet had forgot to wipe the stems and a trickle of water was seeping through her skirt . Timothy was being asked questions quite as personal plus such gracious attentions : " I bet , Mr. Hale , I 'm the first person you 've met who dares to admit she has n't read your book ! " " I 'm almost afraid to talk to you , Mr. Hale , for fear you 'll put me in your next novel . " " Say , Hale , sold the movie rights yet ? Do n't see a movie in it myself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue looked at each other in growing despair . The large lady caught the look , seized them both by the arms , and trotted them off the platform with " These two people are all tired out . Molly , I 'm taking them over to my house for  | a half hour . I 'll get them back to you in plenty of time for your dinner . " Mrs. Pruyn , helpless , saw them go . The Hales found themselves once more in the limousinehearse  --  Madam President may have had to walk home ? and being waved rapidly through town by cotton-gloved policemen in defiance of traffic lights . Their impressive hostess and her chauffeur took this procedure as a matter of course . Certainly , thought Susan , these prerogatives of the rich had advantages . Were they going to be very rich ? They would if the rest of the novels sold as well as this one . But Susan did n't see Timothy demanding or even accepting favors not accorded to his more or less dear Common People . He was rather fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had stopped in front of a large red brick and white stone manor house . There was a vast cool hall ; a liveried man servant said that Mr. Snodgrass had just come in . " Anderson , take Mr. Hale to Mr. Snodgrass . Mrs. Hale , come upstairs with me , I know you want to take off your hat . It 's a smart hat but awfully tiring on the right eyebrow . " In fifteen minutes the entire family had gathered  --  an unexpectedly handsome father of the English colonel type , a tall boy and girl , mother , and the Woman Friend who always is attached to any large well-run household ; also a tray of tall etched glasses and silver-stoppered bottles and thin , pleasantly salty sandwiches . All these were assembled upon a canopied terrace facing a broad lawn over which sprinklers waved veiled arms in lazy rhythm with the Allerton Woman 's Club lost iii the mist . The Snodgrass family were casually admiring of the lecture and their guests , then talked of other things . Would Mr. Hale play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play golf . How about tennis and tea in the afternoon at the country club ? " Mrs. Snodgrass , you are an angel of thoughtfulness but  | I have an uneasy feeling that your club president has mortgaged every one of our minutes until we leave tomorrow night . " " Oh we 'll fix that up , " and the President and most of the town were dismissed with her arthritic right hand . " We loathe going , but what time are we expected for dinner ? " asked Susan whose conscience was working through the genial vapors of her drink . " Yes , you must go . Poor Molly will be in a state . No , we are not coming . We have an absurd preference for dining at home , " at which the family guffawed in understanding unity . " We 'll call you up in the morning . You 're dining with us tomorrow night in any case . " With fleet dignity the motor carried them to a modest suburban dwelling several blocks away , and as they approached they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reminded of that dinner Tim 's mother had given them in Bannerman . " I bet it will be another just like it , " thought Susan . And it was . Except that the chicken was less good , the flowers better arranged , the caterer 's ice cream more magnificent , there was a waiter who tried to fool them with cider wrapped in a napkin , and the female guests would talk about " God 's Own Country . " After dinner there was a reception with the same questions the Hales had listened to after the lecture . At nine next morning a knock at the door . " What fun , " whispered Susan , " trays in bed . " There was nothing they adored more than illicit eating , that is , eating anywhere but in a dining-room . It was Mrs. Pruyn . " My dear , I hope I did n't wake you , but the reporters are downstairs and they so want to get something from Mr. Hale for this evening 's papers . Would he mind , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what about some breakfast ? " Tim grumped . " Shhhhhh .... Mrs. Pruyn , send the reporters up in two minutes and would it be possible for us to have some breakfast on a tray up here ? " " Uh ? you mean send the men up to your bedroom ? " " Of course , they 're used to it . Nighties are no novelty to ? uh ? that is , they always get their best interviews that way . More informal , you know . And you might ask the maid to put two extra cups on the tray for the gentlemen of the press , " and Susan firmly closed the door on the bewildered Mrs. Pruyn , who doubtless had hoped to be a witness to this mystic rite called interviewing . " Hurry , Tim , and put your head under cold water .... But let me nip in just for a second , first ! I ca n't wait ! " The rest of the day the Hales were Entertained . Timothy upset Mrs. Pruyn by pouring milk on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Susan was distressed to find that the little President had not been invited by the outrageous Mrs. Snodgrass to dinner on the Hales ' way to the train . They were constantly being faced with these social complications of a society to which they only belonged for a few hours , but whose subtleties they immediately caught . The worst of it was that it was always the snootiest or the most disreputable who rescued them from their kindly and respectable hosts . Sometimes it would be the reporter who came to interview , bringing with him an invitation from the Press Club . Whereupon Timothy would joyously decamp and leave Susan to carry on . It was hard sometimes because she knew she was not a welcome substitute . The Club had paid to hear the Author  --  and to talk to him later . Where was he ? As the train scrunched its way out of the station Susan sighed , " I feel as if I had known the Snodgrasses all my life , and Mrs. Pruyn I 'll forget in a week . ' Tai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha and Mary business .... I 'm adoring all this  | reflected glory , Mr. Hale , but how about beating it before the excitement dies down ? There 's always a point of satiation . " " Right you are ! What , madam , I say what about this place called You-rup ? " " Could we ? " " I do n't see why not . The little old dollars are rolling in , foreign exchange is low , we 're both a bit off our American iced , let 's go down to the steamship office tomorrow . "  | CHAPTER XX **44;349;TOOLONG LIMPING slightly and head and bones still aching from inoculations for typhoid , diphtheria , smallpox  --  all the post- . war diseases Timothy could think of  --  he , Susan , with Mrs. Brooke holding Roger by the hand , stood in a group large enough to cause passersby on the Promenade Deck to stare . The ship reporters , with no illusions as to the modesty of the Great Ones , liked this latest shooting star . He had no side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to them . Iie was a fellow-craftsman . And he said something that would look well iii a head-line . " Would you and Mrs. Hale give us a picture , the baby , too ? Just up these steps to the boat deck where the light is better .... So , first the family group , then Mr. Hale alone . " Three huge cameras pointing at them from different angles . More passersby staring . " Must be some one of importance . Do you recognize their faces ? Let 's look in the passenger list . " Timothy and Susan had been thrilled since dawn . The trunks had already gone with their proud and instructive labels , but there were bags to be packed , breakfast to be eaten , their last meal in America for months , years , no telling . Roger to be dressed in rose cloth coat and a great English sailor hat like a halo round his curls . The corsage of gardenias , sent to Susan by the thoughtful Mr. Darcy , to be pinned on the left shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Timothy .  | " Oh well , we 'll have champagne for dinner tonight , and a cocktail in a real bar before ! " As they followed the steward down the narrow corridor , the familiar steamer smell , so like that of an empty and decaying hot-water bottle , thrust Susan back fifteen years and she saw in Timothy the tall figure of her father and she vaguely looked around for her little brother Frank .... The staterooms were exciting , a single one for Timothy and a double one for her and Roger , and so much more ingenious and pretty than the old Grosse Kurfiirst and Oceanic or even the Auguste Victoria . Boxes and packages were lying everywhere . It was like Christmas . A knock at the door . " Frank ! " but grown up and with a mustache , and a present he probably could not afford . " Darling , it does n't seem right to be going abroad without you . Mamma ? why you must n't cry , dear . If we decide to stay over more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily over there , we 'll send for you . Of course , we will ! " More knocks . Mr. Darcy , Mr. Loose , his triumphant publishers . Tim 's best man at the wedding , Geoffrey Starrett , now a broker who occasionally wrote an essay for the New Republic when he was not dining out . Angela Snow from Fashion ? Susan was amazed to see her . Years ago Angela had refused to marry a man she loved because of the conjurable possibility that some day , somewhere , he might eat peas with a spoon , and from that moment a lavender-and-old-lace timidity had settled upon her to remain with her the rest of her life . Knock , knock . An editor from a magazine Hale had avoided writing for . A pretty girl and her husband whom the Hales had met only two nights before at a dinner at the Brevoort . An advertising man , name unknown , who wanted to get Tim to write a testimonial for a typewriter . What a strange collection of people  --  only two relatives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on'the packages  --  Washington , St. Paul , Bannerman , San Francisco ,  | Plainfield , New jersey , of course they had friends , but so scattered , no gang . Would n't it be funny if they created one in London , Paris , Rome ? " Mamma , do take Roger up on deck , he 's getting mangled here . In fact , why do n't we all go up ? . . . Angela , I do n't want to embarrass you by asking which box is yours , in case there is no box , but ? " " That small one over there with the silver and pink ribbon . " " I must open it right now . " It was a package of letters , one to be read each morning of the trip . " What a sweet thought , my clear . I bet there 's a dirty joke in each one . " " Susan , you arc appalling ! I do n't think marriage has improved you .... Tell me , are you awfully happy , still very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Susan 's sex emotions . " I ca n't seduce my husband here and now to prove my mad passion , but that I am deliriously happy is fairly obvious , is n't it ? What do you think of my chee-ild ? ... Come on , Mamma may have let him fall overboard . " Warning bugle blasts , aimless scurryings , bad band music , misplaced kisses , farewell wharf inanities , Susan holding up a patient Roger to wave good-bye to a grandmother and uncle he did not see , Timothy hugging her arm and chanting , " Travelin ' , tee-rains , and now little boats , Susie my own . " By tipping the stewardess heavily and thanks to two naps a day and an early bedtime , Roger was not entirely on Susan 's hands during the voyage . But enough . And she was never free from the horror lest his unsure feet take him too close to the rails and the perilous sea . But at lunch and dinner she and Tim were together , and for walks during the nap hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers had settled down to chairs and rugs and air pillows and the tasting of ship 's consomme and bon voyage books  --  provided them  | with the unique intoxication of beholding every third lounger reading or resting ' ' Irom " God 's Own Country . " This seeing people actually reading the book was different from viewing piles of it in a shop waiting for readers . But the greatest fun of all was having the man whose chair was next to Tim 's ask Tim what he thought of this new novel every one was talking about . " I have n't read it , " said Tim . " What do you think of it ? " " Pretty slow going so far , ca n't seem to get into it yet . Come from a small town myself , and I must say I never heard any one in it talk and behave the way these folks do . Would you like me to lend it to you ? " " No-o-o-o-o-o , " drawled Timothy , " thanks very much . I prefer to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty judging by her shoes and her corsets had stopped at Tim 's chair . " This is Mr. Hale , is n't it ? Mr. Timothy Hale , the writer ? Please do n't get up . I just wanted to ? " But Tim was struggling to get up out of a chair designed especially to get up out of with a struggle . " I just wanted to tell you how wonderful I think your book is ! I come from a small town myself and at times the truth of your book was almost more than I could bear . I 'm living , in New York now .... " There did n't seem to be an answer . Tim shook hands with her , thanked her . Susan looked out to sea . The man in the next chair slipped " God 's Own Country " under his rug . The lady smiled waveringly and drifted off . " Say , er , Mr. Hale , my name 's Oscar P. Rudge , from Cincinnati , and say I did n't know ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim grinned . " Say do you know any one in Bannerman , Ohio ? That 's my home town .... You do ? What about a drink ? ... Susan , will you excuse us ? Mr. Uh , my wife . " With Mr. Rudge and a Haryard classmate discovered in  | the smoking-room a club was instantly formed which resulted in the Amen Corner with Timothy for president . They met every day before lunch , in the middle of the afternoon , and after Susan had gone to bed . Occasionally she joined the Corner , the only woman among ten men whose work and worries had taken them from Rosebud , Montana to Rangoon , Burma . With these men Susan was quiet , non-assertive , enchanted to listen , and they liked her , but their happiest moment was just before bar closing time , when the beautiful thin sandwiches of cheese and salmon came around and they all ordered their final drinks . Then would begin the doleful singing which is man 's sentimental solace and substitute for women . The I Idles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Susan 's only disappointment was that she did not find shuffle-hoard as much fun as when she was fifteen . Perhaps later when she played it with Roger . Deck tennis was better . Nor could she be as agitated as she remembered over the attention of the ship 's officers . After all , theirs was a ferryboat existence , and their friendships and flirtations with the passengers as short-lived . Had any one at a New York dinner ever been introduced thus : " Mrs. Hale , Mr. Harknet , third officer of the Majestania " ? The afternoon of the first day the purser had appeared and with the compliments of the Steamship Company had suggested that perhaps Mr. and Mrs. Hale would be more comfortable in a suite on Deck A. " lint this is quite comfortable , " answered the astonished Timothy . " Still I think you would be more comfortable in this new arrangement , and there is a private bath .... I am hoping to read God 's Own Country ' on the way over , Mr. Hale .... Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his table , and perhaps you and Mrs. Hale would come to his cabin for a cocktail before dinner tonight . "  | " Jesus ! " was Timothy 's remark as the purser closed the door . " There 's something to this being a Famooser . " " A suite and a private bath , cheers ! But , Tire , you 'd better give the purser fifteen dollars right now and perhaps some more when we land . We may meet him on another ship . "  | CHAPTER XXI , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , I , , THE I TALES were not going to the Savoy or Cecil on the Strand because it was the obvious American thing to do , they said . An Englishman on board had suggested the Hyde Park in Knightsbridge , and , situated on the Park , healthy and practical for Roger . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at its height and the hotels crowded . Two brass trimmed , high-swung taxis , one containing Timothy and the bags and two trunks and the other convoying Susan , Roger , and more luggage , wheezed up to the impressive entrance of the Hyde Park . The doorman , as resplendent as a Mexican general , poked his head in the taxiwindow . " Beg pardon , sir , but have you reservations ? Otherwise , sorry to say , sir , but we 're full up . " " Yes , of course . I wired ahead . Still , better make sure before we take out all this baggage . " In fifteen minutes Tim returned and explained to Susan , " We do n't stay here and for the most incredible of reasons . The clerk said he had reserved rooms for us thinking they would be ready in time for our arrival , but apparently the lady occupant decided at the last moment to have a baby in one of them and ca n't be moved ! If that 's a lie , it certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . " " Oh Tim , what shall we do ? " Susan in her quick despair pictured them wandering from hotel to hotel rejected of the Lord , and finally sleeping in the cabs .  | " Cheer up , there 's an excellent smaller hotel nearby , the Cadogan , facing a garden where Roger can play . The clerk himself , no , ' clark ' as we English say , telephoned'and made reservations for us . " The sun smiled again . They loved the Cadogan on sight , small , friendly , with high-ceilinged rooms and a completely British air . The Hales preferred to have their meals served in their drawing-room but in the halls and in the lift they encountered magnificently dressed males and ladies in chiffon frocks and umbrellas who obviously had come up from the country for the season and were on their way to the King 's Garden Party . Their voices like chirping birds filled the corridors with a pleasant pastoral sound , not like American voices which drove their sharp files through the thickest walls . " Timmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nurse for Roger . Could we have one of those creatures with a fluttery blue or brown veil ? I 'll go down and see the manager at once . I know he can help me . " A series of " yes , madams " and " no , madams " produced the information that the veils belonged to a specially and highly trained association , and that the office would be only too glad to get in touch with it at once . It was all so simple . Susan ignored the lift which operated quite nakedly and visibly in a sort of slot , and excitedly ran up the stairs to their rooms . Tim was sitting in a chintz-covered armchair facing a composition in still life which was to become most familiar to Susan : two tall glasses with an inch or two of whiskey and a small fat bottle of Schwepps soda water , and no cracked ice . " Let 's drink to London and ? " " Tim , do n't you think we 'd better send off the letters of introduction at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all your English publisher . It takes so long to get things started , and we do n't want to waste a minute ? " " For God 's sake , sit down and relax and drink your  | drink ! The only thing that matters is Thee and Me  --  damn the letters of introduction ! Look at Roger over there , playing with the andirons . The child has more philosophy of life right now than you will ever have ! " Susan sat down reluctantly , and sipped her drink . " What delicious whiskey ! So soft and sweet , and it really tastes better without cold storage . It seems a pity Roger ca n't have a drink , too . Three old bums  --  kiss me ! " The English are a cold nation , reserved and suspicious of strangers , especially Americans . Timothy had small hope that his meteoric reputation had pierced the prejudiced sensibilities of the Brit isle critics , or that the letters of introduction would produce more than a few perfunctory teas . Within one week all these impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in its English edition had been treated portentously in The Spectator and The Mercury . There was a thick meaty quality to this new author 's writing that was impressive after the Wild Western and Big Business stories and the divorce and murder scandals which the English press preferred to regard as representative American literature . Also this ' Timothy Hale seemed to question the complete allrightness of a former colony of Great Britain . The Hales ' first telephone call ? " helloh , helloh , are you thcah ? " ? was to the English publisher which resulted in invitations to A Tea in a week 's time , dinner on Thursday , and the address of a good tailor . The nurse with the fluttery veil had been achieved  --  Susan had chosen the one with the reddest cheeks and the best teeth and the least superior recommendations  --  so that she and Tim were free to go off on bus rides , lunch at the Cheshire Cheese and Simpson 's , dine at the Cafe Royal , and go to American movies wherever they could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where Susan 's English father had bought his clothes she did not know  --  there was a very good chance that some of  | them had never , been paid for  --  but Savile Row was the traditional address for London tailors . Therefore when the publisher suggested his tailor on Conduit Street , Timothy and Sue were disappointed . It was as if they had discovered there was no Piccadilly or Regent Street . The tailor found Susan a bit disconcerting . She had the aggressiveness of American wives with the accent of an English lady . He mildly despised Timothy for bringing a woman with him to choose his manly apparel from bolts of orthodox materials , and yet respected her judgment in shoulders , trouser hang , and general " drape . " " Re-ahlly , Mr. Truslove , you are the first person to understand my husband 's figure . Do you suppose you could rush these two lounge suits and the dinner clothes ? ... Yes , the Guaranty Trust Company . ... The ? er ? usual discount for cash , yes ? " Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susie , where do you learn these things ? " " Absorption , my darling , and also from my dear father who used to get all the discounts without the cash ! " Their first outgoing telephone call had been to an English publisher . Their first incoming message was delivered by a voice unmistakably American . " Mr. Hale ? This is Solon Richardson , London representative of The Circle .... No , I do n't want an interview , just the pleasure of meeting you , if I may . " " Come right over , " answered Timothy , who hated to be alone except when he was typing or sleeping . Susan knew he pictured himself as a brown-robed monk , solitary in a cell and dedicated to bread and water and the fine illumination of the Scriptures , but , in fact , reading rather bored him , walks were twice as healthy with a companion , and a telephone ring rarely elicited any other answer than " Show him up . " Timothy maintained he could get more out of an hour 's talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same subject . Perhaps he was right . It was understandable that London soon became his favorite city , for here it was not considered effeminate for a business man to eat with women in the middle of the day or pause for a cup of tea at half-past four . " Come in , " called out Tim , and Solon Richardson came in and stayed in , as far as . Timothy 's heart was concerned , for the rest of the lives of the two men . Solon , known as " Solo " the world over , was primarily a newspaperman who might be war correspondent this year and magazine editor next . He was expansively big without being fat . His voice boomed without being raucous . He had been chased by wolves in Siberia , fascisti in Italy , communists in Russia , ku-kluxers in the States , but he always got his story though his only language was Middle West . No , no , come to think of it , he did have a fine assortment of " yeses " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to concede to French individualism by asking at I Larry 's or the Chatham Bar for a " viskee-sodah . " Otherwise his native tongue was uncontaminated . Like Tim , his instinct was to think a man  --  women hardly counted  --  was a reg'lar feller until he proved himself a dirty bastard . When he entered their hotel drawing-room he dismissed Susan at once as a wife , and concentrated upon this newcomer who might have a serial for The Circle . " Many of these lousy newspapermen been round to bother you ? " Richardson asked Timothy . " Nope . You 're the first , " Tim grinned comfortably at Solon . " Only got here a few hours ago . " " Say , that ai n't fair . Really is a fact I just wanted to meet you . I-icard so much about you from the fellers in New York . Thought perhaps I could be of some use to you , know the ropes pretty well , been living here over a year . Like the English ? " " I hardly know yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've always felt sentimental about England , mother  | country sort of thing , and their reviews of my book have certainly been most generous . " " Well , it 's this way . When I 'm in England I set so darn sore at their slowness , their food , their climate , their standoffishness , that I could take the next steamer home . And then when I get back to New York , doggoned if its rudeness , its over-chumminess , its speeding up about nothing at all , do n't make me crazy to get back here where they really know how to enjoy life ? and uh ? drinking . " " Say , how about a high-ball ? I have n't got over the thrill yet of being able to ring for a waiter and order a drink without feeling like a criminal . " " Well , I 'll give you all the chance for thrills you want , " and they both hawed-hawed cheerfully . " Say , do you mind if I give you a steer about these fellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ? Keep off the war debt , and hand out all the blarney you can think of . England likes that sort of thing just as much as any other nation . And another thing . I suppose you 'll be seeing all the big guns  --  Wells , Galsworthy , Shaw , Bennett ? " " And the King , God bless him , " answered Timothy solemnly , standing up and saluting . Solo cocked a sceptical eye at Timothy . " Well , they 're all lovely people , but these American correspondents are as foxy as they make ' em , and they 'll try to use you to get free copy out of these big men who are pretty sore about it because they have been tricked so often . So do n't let your heart of gold get the best of you and present these bozoes with letters of introduction to Messrs . Wells and Company  --  it 'll be you who will suffer . I know  --  it happened to me .... Doing anything tonight ? " " N-n-n-no . " Tim shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger to bed . " What about me calling up the missus and you and Mrs. Hale dining with us somewhere ? "  | " I 'd better ask Susan . We have a small boy and no nurse yet , " and Timothy went into the bedroom closing the door behind him . " Henpecked ? " wondered Richardson . " Oh Tim , " wailed Susan , " our very first night in London ? with strangers ? I 'd rather thought of getting the housemaid to come in and watch the baby , and you and me going for a bus ride and perhaps dinner at Scott 's where I used to lunch with Father . " " There 'll he lots more days , and this fellow may be useful to me  --  all that Circle crowd . And he 'll give us lots of tips about London . " " Then let us ( line here in our own sitting-room , and I wo n't have to worry about Roger . " " Fine ! Say you 'll like this Richardson , salt of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war correspondent , everything . " " Are we going to see nothing but Americans while we are here ? " Susan was hurt , and therefore annoyed , because their first night in London  --  as she had planned it  --  had been spoilt . " Of course not ! But I most certainly am not going to rule them out altogether . " He left the bedroom abruptly . Solo had been married eight years , and he felt something in the air . " Say if I 'm interfering with your plans ? But when I see people I like , I grab ' em , " and he smiled at Tim like a friendly dog . " Same here , " and Tim laid his hand on Solo 's shoulder . " Well , I 'll give Isabel a ring , from downstairs , several office calls to make , " and Tim who had only been married seven years knew that Isabel might also have to be placated . Susan liked Solo almost at once , and was to like him more and more . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susie , and they had several little family jokes between them , but his interest in women , even in his wife , was so imper-  | sonal , his manner.aso unvaryingly hearty with every one , there was no telling if he had ever realized her as an entity apart from Tim . If they chanced to sit together he asked perfunctory questions about Roger and what kind of a crossing they had had , in between throwing over his shoulder jocose and highly defamatory remarks at Timothy . Isabel proved to be a rather pretty woman with a querulous mouth and a defensive manner . They had no children and she had followed Solo all over the world with not too much complaining . She was growing tired now and she wanted a home of her own , she thought , in America . But she had sat , waiting , so long for Solo in railway stations , hotel bedrooms , automobiles , business offices , banks , that she had forgot how to make a home and the women friends who properly should go with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feeling for her . Dislike on sight . Susan suggested gardens , nurseries , calling cards . Her English accent was a red rag to Isabel 's cornfield Americanisms . This man Hale might be all right , but his wife obviously was a snob . All through dinner Susan struggled to make conversation , but they had nothing in common . Isabel had been everywhere and seen nothing . She had no thoughts except those immediately associated with her welfare or Solo 's . She got along with his men friends largely because she made no demands on them and could drink when necessary with the strongest of them . She doubtless watched out for Solo 's laundry and darned his socks and was always near the telephone when he wanted her . But she was patently dissatisfied and Susan was her latest dissatisfaction . Isabel was a kind of wife Susan was to meet often in their several successive years of European traveling . They were not always married to newspapermen , sometimes their husbands had minor jobs in American banks and tourist offices , or they  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazily abroad . Tim said : " These women have an easy acceptance of life which you might well learn to copy . " Sue replied : " It is easy to accept where there is no mind to discriminate . " If there were children , she could occasionally establish contact on that basis , but quite as often these wives were second wives , with no children , young , pretty , clothes loving , out for a perpetual good time . Susan did not know what they were like among themselves but before her they were full of manners . They would flinch at the sight of a tipped soup plate , crook their little fingers when drinking coffee , and one she incredibly beheld eating cherries with a knife and fork . What mixed talk there was took the form of " kidding , " then there was a parting of the sexes , and the men would be grouped at one end of the dinner table , or more often two marble cafe tables pushed together , and there was man talk and woman talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit at the dull end , not that the man talk was always so vastly superior . On evenings in Harry 's Bar in Paris , at the Adlon in Berlin , at the Gaffe Greco in Rome , she had sat blind with boredom for hours listening to such inebriate brilliance as : " Tim , djever try this amer piton drink with a dash of seltzer ? Got a kick like a mule ! " " I guess lil old Hale and Farewell has poked his snoot into every drink there is . " " Say , djever try mixing liqueurs ? Quite a stunt . And this Haiti rum ! Oh boy , djever have a rum swizzle ? I remember once when I was down in Haiti , covering one of their annual protests , drinking at the old Ice House five rum swizzles and six planter 's punches in succession and maybe ... " " Hennessy Three Star is good enough for me . You would n't believe it but honestly I 'm getting to like brandy  | better'n whisked , God , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home with these effete tastes of mine . " " And by God , I like to carry a cane ! I notice our lil best seller Timothy also swings a fancy malacca . God 's Own Country will never stand for that , sweetheart . " " Is n't this drink the Wops call an Arnericano a libel on ... " I tell you there 's not a chance for the Labor Party to get in , I tell you there 's not a chance , I 'm betting money on it , say , Best Seller , how about me betting your money ? ... " Over and over and over they said the same things , asked questions to which they expected no answers , secure and happy in each other 's company . But Susan , sipping a creme de menthe frappe which she loathed but which lasted a long time and was harmless , wondered when Timothy would decide to go home . She honestly hated to show her disapproval , but it was so apparent as she sat , frequently the only woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked her way . Sometimes Tim would fling out furiously , saying she was a killjoy and swearing never to take her with him again . But the very next night after a righteous dinner party they would fly joyously to the circle of these friendly fellows who never demanded anything more than that you pay your share of the drinks  --  no , not even that . Then one morning Susan would pick up a paper and read a brilliant special article wired from the thick of a Chinese rebellion and signed by one of the group . " Why , Tim , I did n't even realize he had gone away . " Their second week in London when they were dressing for the publisher 's tea , Susan forgot herself in admiration of her husband  --  and Mr. Truslove . Timothy was made for English clothes . The artful " drape " had disguised his sloping shoulders and short waist in not too well-fitting cloth of blue with a fine white stripe . A pale gray shirt and a wing collar  | were wedded to a white-dotted blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encompassed by linen spats , and his long fingers held chamois gloves and a stick from Briggs . Upon his head he wore Lock 's latest interpretation of a gray soft hat . " Tim , you are divine ! Whether it pleases you or not , you look like a Scotchman , the laird of Aucherlocherty , master of five glens , six bur-r-rns , seven lochs , and a pair of bagpipes . All you need is a thistle in your button-hole . " " I also have read my Stephen Leacock , " answered Tim , trying to see himself entire in the mantelpiece mirror . " What are you going to wear ? " " It 's a hot afternoon , I think Maud Muller at the garden gate is my rile . That long embroidered white net with the wide pink hat and lil blue sash around my tummy . We certainly are going to be grand advertisements for God 's Own Country . " And that exactly is what they were ! Literary London had come to the tea expecting something in a medium sombrero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chine wife . Timothy , clothes-conscious , called no one by his first name and answered questions with becoming restraint . Susan 's accent became more and more Oxonian and unintelligible , and to such exclamations as " But you do n't sound in the least American ! " she took delight in replying , " My father and mother were English . " " Oh ! ... Wo n't you and Mr. Hale lunch with us Monday fort n't ? " At the first chance Susan inched over to Timothy . " Did you catch any of the names ? I feel like Alice in Wonderland . There 's William J. Locke over in the corner , looking very Marcus Ordcyne . And E. Phillips Oppenheim with a large nose and whispering I know to a Russian lady spy . Did you meet Berta Ruck ? High , wide and fancy ? I adored her .  | Hutchinson , there , with the glasses , " If Winter Comes , " you =member . I terrifwd him . May Sinclair , speechless . " Timothy was triumphant . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Cats ! " " Have you seen Wells or Bennett or Galsworthy ? " " No . I do n't think they go much to literary teas . By Jove ? " " I say ! how English we 're getting . " " All right , by heck then . You did mail those letters to all of them ? We ought to be hearing from them in a few days . " H. G. Wells Timothy was to meet quite unexpectedly over a dish of chow mein in an Oxford Street Chinese restaurant . He returned to Susan waving a flag of Wellsian allegiance and an invitation to spend next week-end at Easton Glebe in Essex . Susan was to be disappointed in ambassadors with monocles and sashes across their chests , in great surgeons and famous soldiers , in successful playwrights though rarely in an actor , but in England 's four literary olympians ? Wells , Galsworthy , Shaw and Bennett ? she was to have every fancy of them lived up to . Mr. Wells was an active host . He insisted you play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did not feel a fool if you missed the ball . His talk , as he sat with his small hands folded , his small feet in patent leather slippers dangling , his small voice speculating about large things , enthralled Susan as much as it did Timothy . On Sunday night of their week-end Mr. Wells and Philip Guedella , an American correspondent and Tim , were so enchantingly engaged in revolutionizing the end of the twentieth century that Susan refused to heed the polite suggestion of Mrs. Wells that it was half-past ten and that she leave the gentlemen to themselves . " Please , I do n't want to go to bed . If they would let me  | sit in that big chair in the corner I would n't say a word , truly I would n't , and I am sure they would soon forget me . " Susan tried to look like a wistful little girl and the gentlemen all smiled , but her hostess did not . Susan knew men , talking men , and an hour later when she slipped noiselessly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say good-night . They lunched with John Galsworthy in his flower-filled Hampstead home with the dear dogs running in and out . Their hosts had adopted the high and sunny places of the States , and as marks of their approval of Americans provided the Ilaics with iced cocktails and salted nuts . Here indeed was your monk working in a lone cell , and the Hales felt themselves garrulous and bouncing and too naively excited about being alive . Nevertheless that moment of receiving Mr. Galsworthy 's unsolicited and warm-hearted appreciation of " God 's Own Country " remained for Timothy the highest moment of his success . Bernard Shaw roared into their lives , quite properly , on a motor hike , somewhere in Kent , at the home , was it ? of some one associated with the Manchester Guardian . Mr. Shaw , pink of cheeks and ears like a well-scrubbed baby , took off his small straw hat , a child 's beach hat , fixed a glittering blue eye upon them , and started in to talk . A deft question now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . Timothy and Susan sat breathless . " Frank Harris , Frank Harris , yes , of course , I wrote for him when he was editor of The Saturday Review . Amusing fellah always . Say anything . I 've seen him come into a drawing-room full of people , look about him carefully , then choose the most inoffensive woman and plunge his teeth into her calf . Figuratively , of course .... No , I do n't drink , do n't smoke . Must be off . " R-r-r-r-r-r-r ! Perhaps Susan was exaggerating but certainly she remem-  | bered sinking back with a gasp when he disappeared . She wondered if she and Timothy with their rapid speech , intolerant opinions and their leaping from subject to subject without any preamble , did n't affect others in much the same way . She had seen their guests of mild and uncombative natures and low blood pressure drag themselves away wan and exhausted at ten o'clock . Outside they probably swore never to stand on the Hale doorstep again . A dinner in Cadogan Square , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belloc Lowndes and the beautiful first manuscript of " Old Wives ' Tale , " were Susan 's chief impressions of their first meeting with Arnold Bennett . Their second meeting was two years later in the Hales ' home in Chelsea , when Mr. Bennett outstayed the other guests and settled himself in a corner of the library sofa before a low coal fire , asked his manifestly admiring hosts the names and professions of the other guests , and breathed softly , " I am very comfortable here , I feel very safe . "  | CHAPTER XXII , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 1 . 1 , , , 1 , , , , 1 , , 1 , , , , THE I-HALES were a success . They were enough different to he amusing and not too different to be embarrassing . They were " commanded " to a week-end by Lady Astor , who was girlish and cozy and delighted them at Sunday lunch by calling clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say , will your boss be free for dinner on June loth ? " They drank tea on the Terrace with a member of Parliament , they drank claret in Chelsea with Augustus John . They dined with Maynard Keynes and knit their brows over the gossipy abstractions of the Bloomsburyians , and were distressed by Duncan Grant 's naked brown ladies , life size , sprawling over the chaste white panels of their Georgian houses . They Sunday-lunched with the Claude GrahamWhites , lunched on the staple English June diet of salmon mayonnaise , lamb cutlets , green peas , tipsy cake and fruit salad . Ilcre the guests were all stars and twinkled at their hostess ' bidding . The Duncan Sisters sang and Elsa Maxwell played for them . Ethel Levy Graham-White sobbed Al Jolson 's " Mammy " and Erlanger built a theater  --  no , no , that 's wrong . Susan hated herself for being lust a wife of a famous man and determined that she would study under Yvette Guilbert and he a diseuse . But a darn good one ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " T/farnmv " sung dozens of times before , but when Ethel Levy sang it , she converted her own drawing-room into an impersonal stage , and Susan 's eyes were teary over the homesickness of a colored  | boy for his mother . Be a professional or  --  be a professionally good wife ! Because the Hales had never lived in Ntw York since Best-Sellerdom had made them acceptable to lion-hunting hostesses , London took on for them a deceptive intimacy which they had never experienced in their previous city dwelling . They accepted every invitation as it came along . An extemporaneous meal at the Ivy or the Tour Eiffel , where the food was of equal importance with the conversation , and with Rebecca West often present that said much for the excellence of the food .... A week-end at the vast establishment of a newspaper lord where Susan adored the vastness , but again hated her inability to be Somebody ? to play superb tennis , brilliant bridge , sing negro spirituals . There were moments when she and Timothy , tired of repeating " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom on the pretense of writing letters , and while Tim snoozed , Susan stood at a window and watched with envy pretty Lady Sylvia and Lady Margaret returning swift serves of equally pretty secretaries of Cabinet ministers . The English Speaking Union , and other Clubs less concerned about hands meeting across the sea , desired Timothy 's voice to be raised at the end of dinners . He was asked to speak in the monetary interest of more beds for hospitals , and once he halved a debate with a corrosively polite English writer which got them exactly nowhere . Susan , who took a physical joy in a good fight , was delighted by Timothy 's courageous attitude in his speeches . He remembered Solo Richardson 's warning that Londoners were not adverse to a compliment but at the same time he disliked the sugary acquiescence of some of his fellow countrymen in the tradition that it was enough to be English to be right . Also it seemed impossible to keep away from the war debt . Uncle Sam had become Uncle Shylock , and Timothy actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | lying innocently in a barber 's chair , he became aware that he was being talked at , not to , by the indignant tax-burdened occupants of adjoining chairs , who regarded him as personally to blame for the enforced payment of the American debt . The phrase " dollar-chasing American " inflamed him , so that no matter what the subject of his speech somewhere before the end he would find himself comparing the generous spending of Americans with the penny-pinching of other nations . This hold alluding to a favorite jibe always caused the audience to gasp , and the delighted journalists to comment in next clay 's press . Perhaps the English admired Timothy 's refusal to pander , his taking of a sporting chance , for the Hales ' invitations to dinner did not fall off  --  unlike America where one complimentary allusion to Bolshevik Russia and you might starve as far as your banker friends were concerned . At first the literary parties were fun because they were never too ostensibly literary . For six authors there were two musicians , two actresses , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such parties Timothy as always began to chafe . " The English voice is so deceptive . They can chirp It 's a fine day ' so that it sounds like the Eleventh Commandment or the reading of the Magna Charta . But it exhausts me to decipher the twitterings . " ... The novelty of tailor 's fittings had worn off , and he was sure that Paris coffee could not possibly he worse than London 's . " I am wondering do they really like us , Susie ? The only time I 'm genuinely comfortable is in the Pall Mall office of the Guaranty Trust .... Did I tell you a fellow came up to me today when I was getting a check cashed and he said he knew my father in Bannerman ? " " Is this chap dining with us tonight ? " asked Susan , trying not to register resignation . " No , he is n't , but I wish he were ! Have you forgotten we are going to another of these literary dinners tonight ? " Their host this particular evening they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was quantitively read in both countries . He was a bachelor who enjoyed his spinsterhood perhaps a little too much , for his house was too large and his waistband too tight . He did not perspire but you felt he ought to. , , You hoped the middle button of his dinner shirt would pop out , but it never did . He had collections . Blue glass , for example , so blue you could n't see the wine for the glass . And such food ! Sound , well-cooked English food . " You do not like bread sauce ? But that is nine-tenths of roast chicken . Of course , a good bread sauce , I mean ! " It was a dinner of names and one duchess , and as such a pretty dull affair , for they were all rather conscious of being Names  --  and of the duchess . After the chicken and bread sauce and an ice with fresh strawberries , they trailed up the black velvet stairs and sank on purple damask sofas  --  to flirt , to laugh , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another collection , letters addressed to Keats by his grocer ! ... Curious . Names , all of them , bespelled by other Names . On their taxi-way back to the hotel Timothy groused : " If that 's London literary society I 'm through ! I noticed you made for the duchess like a shot . " " No , that 's unfair . I am a snob , of course . But she was the oldest person there , and that funny convent training of mine still urges me to take respectful notice of age . I curtseyed automatically when I met her , and she loved it . That 's why probably she picked me out for the one person to talk to while the gentlemen were presumably cracking nuts and jokes . You 're jealous . She asked me to lunch at the Ladies ' Athenxum next Wednesday , and I am going in my most modest frock . " The following morning Timothy , over kipper of which he had grown rather fond , remarked that he was tired of London . Susan , who preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its tail in its mouth , also she liked Worcestershire sauce , answered , " Quo vadis ? "  | " Paris , " said Timothy , crowding into his mouth a structure of marmalade and toast . " We have n't seen Hampton Court , or Oxford , or the Tower of London , " observed Susan , feeling the brown jug of hot milk to see if it was still hot . She was not as concerned about sight-seeing as when she first arrived . " You take Roger today to the Tower while I ? " " While you lunch at the Cafe Royal with the man who knew your father in Bannerman . " " The woman is psychic ! " " Darling , " said Susan to Roger , " we are going today to sec the Tower of London . That is a great prison where many famous people in the old days were beheaded . " " What 's beheaded ? " Susan explained and Roger was delighted . " Mother , did they chop off the heads with one blow ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward and lie had to strike the poor neck twice . It was so with the Earl of Essex , the friend of Queen Elizabeth . When his head was chopped off he wore a scarlet waistcoat with long scarlet sleeves and he was blond and curly-headed just like you , dearest . Before he laid his head on the block , the executioner kneeled down in front of him and asked to be forgiven . How silly that was , squaring things with God before he committed minder ! " Roger was not paying attention . " What did they do with the head after it was cut off ? " asked the gory-minded child . " Well , the executioner picked up the head by the hair , held it before all the people , and shouted God save the Queen ! ' Then the head was thrown in a basket . " " What did they do with the basket ? " The child was ghoulish ! Ought she really to take him to this sinister place ? Perhaps if she did not his aroused imagination would picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was shining on the gray walls which time had painted in the richest of monotones , the walks were cheerful with strollers in summer clothes , and death was fir away . " Where 's the Bloody Tower ? " asked Roger . " Over there , dear . " " But I don'tw.see any blood , " his voice was disappointed . " Ooooh , look at the great big crows . Can I pat one ? " The ravens , almost as tall as Roger , were strutting about the thick green grass with the lazy insolence of birds which had nothing to fear from boys with sharp stones . Heretofore when Roger had approached birds they had flown away with discouraging promptness . These birds stopped and stared . The child put out a hand to touch one shining blue-black head . Down dipped the head and the beak caught at a dangling white shoe-lace . The movement was so unexpected that Roger lost his balance and screamed . " Shoo , shoo , " cried Susan clapping her hands , but the bird , far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooped the child up in her arms and called to the guard who was drawing near . " Drive away your dreadful bird ! " He regarded her with disapproval . " Madame , these ravens are property of the crown and must not be annoyed . " " Annoyed ! The beastly creature , it might have pecked my child 's eyes out . I think it is a public menace to allow these overgrown birds their freedom . " " Ignorant Colonial , " was what the guard 's face said , and he and the raven turned their backs and walked away in step , it seemed to Susan , and with the pompousness that petty authority engenders in men ? and ravens.  | CHAPTER XXIII 6666666 4 **36;395;TOOLONG I THE NURSE with the fluttery veil had been a wise choice in so far as she knew about diversified diet  --  as diversified as an English diet can be ! ? and the value of sunshine and daily baths . But her " h 's " were hit or miss and her imagination entirely miss . Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had delighted Susan by his casual acceptance of new beds and new faces , his ability to sit quietly in a chair with a picture-book when told to , his recognition that people taller than himself had certain rights . He seemed happiest when he held Susan 's hand , and was promised that they two alone were going off some place , or when she came in to cuddle him in bed at night . He was most appreciative of her appearance in evening clothes . Once when she came in with a tinselly crown a la Russe , a silver-brocaded gown , and a coat supplied by the prolific rabbit of Manchu , his deep-set eyes appraised her and he said , " Mother , you are looking very royal this evening , but please I wish you would kiss me goodnight before you put the red stuff on your mouth . You kiss so much better without it . " So Susan and Timothy concocted an advertisement for a governess which they placed in the " Agony " column of the London Times instead of in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers from the needy and nine comments by journalists . Because the advertisement read thus : " An American author and his wife , with four-year-old  | are going around the world in a leisurely way , occupying year or more . They require for their son a competent man or woman , under 35 , who can speak French-French , teach arithmetic in the desert , or supervise the boy 's welfare in Peking , while the parents wander . " Unfortunately this appeared with " French-French " changed to " perfect French " and the London columnists were quick to acidulate . Said one : " Only the late Monsieur Anatole France could have done justice to such a post . ' Most of the seventy-nine replies were tragic . Majors and Colonels wrote stiffly of their public school successes , in Latin and in cricket , adding : " I hope you will not think the loss of an arm will incapacitate me for the position . " Daughters of clergymen inscribed diffident notes about their ability to mend fine lingerie , manicure nails , and arrange flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Things wrote of the undoubted charm their presence would add to the social life of two benighted Americans , and ladies of title hinted that , at a price , they could teach Mrs. Hale how to curtsey when she was presented at Court . Only one wrote of the possible needs of Roger . This one 's first name was Sarah , she was aged twenty-five , she came from Yorkshire , she had taught in the board-schools , her salary must be seventy-five pounds a year , and she enclosed a photograph . " I like her best , " said Timothy . " So do I , " said Susan . Sarah Ainley . Short , sturdy without being fat , reserved without blighting , pretty without demanding recognition of it . She wore well-cut suits , and silk sweaters which she knitted herself , and mannish felt hats turned up in the back . When she dined with the Hales she dressed in dark taffetas , primly cut at neck and arms , and around her throat a single aquamarine on a thin gold chain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch and a string of amber . Susan wondered what Miss Ainley thought of her barebacked frocks with fishtail trains or her hooped robes de style , but though Sarah remained with the Hales for fifteen months , at the end of that time Susan was still uncertain as to whether or not Sarah liked her . The girl taught Roger how to read and to add and subtract , how to fold up his clothes at night , and to wash the back of his hands  --  sometimes . From Susan she doubtless acquired more or than she had ever had in all her life . To Susan she was a Rock of Ages and a Damned Nuisance .  | " Timmy , I also am tired of hotel cabbage and boiled potatoes and literary gossip , but London is not England . Let 's try a place in the country before we fly to the fleshpots of Paris .... You know you are itching to start the next book . Let 's start it in rural England . " The estate agent 's . " No , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a poor American . Impossible ? Well , I am . Three in family . Nursery important and room for governess . These are charming photographs . In Kent ? Not far from London then . Five master bedrooms and two servants ' rooms . Eight-and-a-half guineas a week including linen and plate , and the servants will remain . " It was a sixteenth century farmhouse which had been transformed into twentieth century modernity ? meaning one bathroom  --  in a village at the foot of the North Downs , among the hop fields , and facing a common that must have been the model for Kate Greenaway 's drawings  --  one grazing horse , five geese in a waddling file , and a child in a sunbonnet . The windows were latticed , the ceilings were low , but not too low , with exposed black beams , the library had walls of carved panels , and the floors were so uneven that you felt you were walking the deck of a gently rolling steamer.  | Susan , remembering Tim 's reproach on Cape Cod that she automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He refused . " This must have been two rooms once , judging by those three upright beams in the middle of the floor  --  supported the plaster , I suppose . I would hate to have to dodge them on nights when I had had a whiskey too many . What 's that rope for ? " They both peered up at the hole in the ceiling through which dangled a knotted rope . " It belongs to that bell we saw in the cupola on the roof . I fancy in the old days it called the farmhands to meals . " " One more reason for me not occupying this room . That hell rope would be an everlasting temptation . " Together they laid their hands on the rope , and then snatched them back as from a hot stove , and looked guiltily at each other . " Susie , you are a darling . You badger me for my own strange good , you make me feel sickeningly inferior most of the time , regardless of this amazing success of mine , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger is your child , not mine . I do n't know after seven years whether or not you have the intelligence of a gnat , and yet I adore you ! " Susan laid herself against him . " You ca n't imagine the importance to a woman of being able to place her cheek on a man 's left shoulder without bending her head to do it . Some woman author told me that she always fell in love with little men  --  they satisfied her sense of the maternal without having to change diapers . I hate little men . I adore you for going onward and upward . But , dearest , if you ever get a tummy or let your delicious crinkly hair recede , that day I start for Reno . " " Idiot ! We shall probably fight until the day one of us is cremated ? "  | " Tim , let 's arrange to die together . I could n't bear life without you . " " All right , but  --  must separate now and then , " Timothy inserted hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole of escape . " But divorce , never ! ... I 'll take the small room next door . " Susan barely change the routine to which the servants were accustomed , except that she shocked Alice , the housemaid , by refusing to have her curtains drawn at night and flinging wide the latticed windows , and by abolishing the sacrosanct matutinal copper cans of hot water , thus giving up the privilege of washing in wash-bowls instead of using the hot running water in the bathroom two feet away . " Alice , I hate wash-bowls and pitchers . The pitchers are so heavy and I hate the dirty water which must be emptied into that nasty jar , and I always try to do the emptying with wet hands and some day I know the bowl will slip . Hot water cans in the morning for Miss Ainley and Master Roger , but Mr. I-Iale and I will use the bathroom . " " Yes , madam , " answered Alice , but she looked as if Susan had simultaneously deprived her of God and King . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a social error . A melodious sounding of a gong had announced that meal . Down came Susan and Tim  --  Miss Ainley and Roger breakfasted in the nursery  --  and down they sat , in a diningroom of black beams and cream plaster walls and a cozy round table upon which a coffee-pot and hot milk jug were keeping their proper temperature over alcohol lamps . The sun and the flowers smiled in through the low windows and Tim and Sue smiled at each other and wondered if they would get bacon and eggs or grilled kidneys or a kipper . They waited . They waited some more .  | What service ! Susan rang a bell . " Alice , breakfast , please . " " Breakfast is here , madam , " and Alice pointed to the sideboard with its row of covered silver dishes on warming Oates . Dear heaven , Susan had forgot ! In England you served yourself at breakfast , a wise recognition of morning unpunctuality . But what did Alice think of them ? The Belfry was so perfect that Susan wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality upon it . She wallowed in its differences ? from rising gong at eight A.M to their last sip of whiskey-and-soda before going to their eleven P.M. beds . Menu-discussing produced exciting new words like marrow , broad beans , bovril and margarine . Gammon , shepherd 's pie , and chipolatas . Tipsy cake , gooseberry fool , savories , and Stilton . Once a week Susan would appeal to Cook thus : " You suggest dinner tonight , Cook . I 'm tired of planning . " Cook 's placid red face became tortured with thought . A silence . At last : " What about a bit of nice mutton , madam ? " And Susan , sure of this inevitable answer , would ask Cook to pop into the fishmonger for a nice bit of salmon , and see if he could spare a nice bit of ice for cocktails . This not having ice in the house worried Susan at first , but as the milk and butter and other foods kept fresh day after day in the cool stone larder , an occasional six-pennyworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1921 the English were still drinking their cocktails warm , so that to order ice especially for them was to make the consumption of a martini an occasion , not a daily necessity . They drank nothing during the day , thereby doubling their pleasure in the bottle of claret which at dinner they would find warming by the dining-room gas fire .  | Because Roger , being healthy and surrounded by love and courtesy , was a quiet and mannerly child , Timothy decided to work at home . Miss Ainley saw that the baby 's exits and entrances were noiseless and that he trundled his replica of a milk cart , excitedly purchased at Hamley 's in London , at some distance from Daddy 's open window . Except on rainy days , A. B. C. ' s and two-and-two 's were taught in the sweetness of the rose-garden . When the sun-dial said noon , lessons were over , and Susan tftld leave her letters and accounts in the paneled library , and join Miss Ainley and Roger for a walk on the common and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a family affair which Timothy resented less than usual . Perhaps the peaceful spirit of the house was too strong for him , for he accepted with only occasional irritation the domestic tone of the conversation , the cutting up of meat for Roger and Miss Ainley 's supervision of fork and spoon , and the nursery ingredients of the desserts . After lunch the house slumbered for an hour , Susan more resigned to naps since the coming of Roger ; then Tim was ready for a walk . As he stood in the doorway of her bedroom , knobbly stick in hand , she regarded him with pride ? he did fit into the background . His ruddy Scotch face above a Liberty tic of almond-green silk , his height clothed in creamy fawn tweeds , his well-shaped legs in green woolly hose , the pride of Jermyn Street and their owner , who swore his unshod feet in these stockings had the appeal of newborn kittens . " Susan , can you believe yet that we have the choice this very afternoon of walking over the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrims ? Of climbing over stiles to a field alive with hop-pickers ? : Of walking in any direction at all and finding another village as perfect as ours ? And if it rains , we can duck into a pub , ladies ' entrance , and drink a port or a tankard of ' alf-and-'alf until the rain stops .  | God , this is living ! This is the home I 've been waiting for all my life ! " Timothy was feeling in the Belfry as much inner content as he was to achieve anywhere in his future wanderings . His never-ceasing , though often subconscious , search for copy made him intensely alive to the joys of the present , instead , as with most humans , magnifying the past and count ! ing timorously upon the future . He and Sue gaged their walking distances so that they would be back home in the chintzy drawing-room for fourthirty tea . That function to them was the epitome of all that was English . In one of the bay-windows was a sofa and in front of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on successive shelves , thin sandwiches of bovril and cress , a seed cake , and a fruity Dundee . Timothy would draw up a fat upholstered chair on the farther side of the table , awaiting the moment when Susan lifted the lace-and-rosebrocade tea-cozy off the silver pot and poured his first cup . It was then they would hunch their shoulders in an ecstasy of mutual appreciation . Sometimes Timothy worked after tea , but more often they played tennis on the grass court . " Sue , do you realize that is an oast house on our very own property , which could be fermenting our very own hops should we choose ? " Timothy enveloped the circular tower with his author 's eye . " I do realize , darling . I also realize that you are not winning on your own serve . " Their tennis was so elementary that Susan did not mind if Roger appeared and got under their feet in his worthy effort at helping them pick up balls . " I simply ca n't play with that child darting in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad . Does it really matter ? " tempered Susan .  | " Yes , it does matter . You never take games seriously . We might easily learn to play well , now that we can practise daily on a court of our own . Roger , sit quietly on that chair over there . " " But , Tim , we so rarely play with the child , and bless his heart , he genuinely thinks he is helping us . " Her voice was piteous . " Very well , then , play with him instead of me , " and he threw down his racket and stalked into the house . Susan avoided Miss Ainley 's eyes , and brightly suggested that they finish the game and let Roger pick up balls . After that she and Timothy chased their own balls , though not daily as Tim had fancied , and he would work himself into a fine sweat , and declare his game was improving . Susan said nothing , knowing full well that the lack of physical coordination which still caused him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent him ever from hitting a tennis ball more than twice in succession . To impress the servants Susan had suggested the first night of their occupancy that Tim dress for dinner . " Why ? " " Custom of the country . " " I 'm damned if I will . I have always doubted that preposterous tale of the Englishman who dressed nightly for dinner in the heart of the Congo , surrounded only by his blacks , and if it is true , then he was an ass . If we have guests , I 'll dress , of course , but to make a function out of our simple rural meal by torturing myself with a boiled shirt is patently absurd . Susie , use your common sense ! " So Susie used her common sense , and each evening changed to a low-backed dinner gown .... Tim brushed his hair . Later on when the local gentry called  --  Indian colonels , Shell Oil magnates , Honorable Members From  --  Susan was  | forced to conclude that the Congo gentleman was undoubtedly an American Anglophile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hesitated to intrude when we were told you were a famous author , and we could hear the sound of your typing machine going all day , but here we are , and would you dine with us on Thursday ? No , please do n't dress , quite informal . " Simultaneous with their acceptance by the Indian colonels , there exploded at their gate one afternoon an overfull open car . Out of it stepped John Drinkwater , Algernon Blackwood , Hugh Walpole , and a pretty lady . It was a chill and misty July day and the open carful snuggled into the drawing-room with voluptuous pleasure . " What about a fire ? " asked Timothy . " Splendid idea , " answered Mr. Walpole , whom Timothy had met and liked at literary dinners in the States , and who had inspired this extemporaneous visit . Susan pressed a button and Alice expertly woke into life a grate heaped with ovoids ? a lingering war-measure in the form of ovals of concentrated coal dust . Alice sensed royalty for tea . The bread-and-butter was super-thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot his profile , Mr. Walpole ventured a not too disparaging word about a fellow writer , and Mr. Blackwood controlled his perception of the Fourth Dimension and stroked the pussy as if it were a cat and not Lucifer . The pretty lady was a Hostess . As such she commanded respect from authors ? and authors ' wives . " Mrs. Hale , will you and your husband sup with us on Sunday ? My boys are down from Oxford , Mr. Lloyd George will be there and Lady Rhondda , and some of our Kentish neighbors , and of course these charming gentlemen here who are so ravenously consuming your delicious sandwiches . " Sunday supper . Miles of driveway between historic  | beeches . Slanting golden shadows of deer in the late English twilight . Maids in musical comedy costumes of black taffeta and plaited net caps . Footmen dressed as footmen . Supper in a Grinling Gibbons dining-room with family portraits by Sargent and Lazio . " Mrs. Hale , we are most informal Sunday evening . We serve ourselves . " On the buffet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmon , that naked fish , and bowls of chilled mayonnaise . An imposing piece of masonry called veal-and-ham pie . Vinegary salad brightened by tiny tomatoes from France . Quivering mounds of concentrated nothing called junket , a compote , and a trifle . Susan and Timothy made democratic efforts to serve themselves but somehow one butler , two footmen , and three maids managed to supply them with plates , cutlery , and wine , " red or white , or champagne , sir . " " Yes , we have a ghost . Judging by his costume he belongs to the period of Charles the First . Black velvet , and lace collar and cuffs , you know .... A curly wig ? Oh , rather , but  --  do n't be shocked  --  he cradles his curly-wigged head in his arm ! On moonlight nights in summer you can see him strolling up and down that pleached walk , beyond the espaliered nectarines . " Headless ghosts ! Pleached walks ! Espaliered nectarines ! Junket ! No , this was neither Bannerman nor New York ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thick oaken doors with worn iron knockers . Thin villa doors with over-bright brass bells . And most appealing of all , at least to the atheistic Hales , was the shabby one opened by the local clergyman himself . He had called one warm evening at the Belfry when the Hales had chosen to have their coffee out of doors . Alice was used to serving it in the drawing-room but Susan said it was  | unimaginative not to use the garden when they were in a land where there were no twilight mosquitoes and where the very flies knew their place . The Reverend Theodore Bloodworthy was brought out to the garden by a respectful Alice . " This is indeed a great honor , Mr. Hale , to have a noted author in our rural midst . Are you peradventure gathering local color ? " inquired Mr. Bloodworthy . " Only in so far , " answered Timothy , flinching at the familiar question , " as I am enjoying a peace of mind very difficult to obtain in machine-mad America . " " Quite so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , I fancy . I have n't had the pleasure of reading any of your books  --  you will understand  --  poor parsons ca n't afford the luxury of many books . " His smile was wistful , his manner courteous , but his speech was strange . Every few minutes there issued from his mouth a clicking sound , followed by a snap of the jaws which would engulf the last words of a sentence . What was the matter with the man ? Susan watched carefully .... False teeth , oh very false , with gums which would have shamed a healthy child with their rosiness . Susan shivered in her sleeveless dinner dress . " Perhaps your good lady will be more comfortable indoors . With the going down of the sun ? " Susan had to pinch herself to realize that she and Tim were sitting in front of an English fireside with a clergyman in his cloth at rest between them , sipping the mildest of whiskeys-and-sodas , and confiding to them , as non-sectarian strangers , that his early work in a London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war profiteers and county spinsters . When he left he shook hands with them both and with an earnestness that was not pastoral said , " This evening has been nuts and wine to me . ... Oh , I quite forgot ! Mrs. Bloodworthy thought perhaps your young son ? we have admired his yellow curls on the common  --  might like , some  | afternoon , to play with our three small nippers , as we say Whitechapel way , and you and Mrs. Hale have a cup of tea with us .... Next Friday at four-thirty ? Splendid ! " The nipperish Bloodworthys had a velocipede which enchanted Roger , and with Miss Ainley to control the AngloAmerican alliance , Timothy and Sue could take full pleasure in their first tea with a member of the Established Church . It was a good tea , an ample tea , the one meal in England which the fastidious could count upon almost anywhere . Mr. Bloodworthy was as gracious in his own home as he had been in theirs , but his wife was one of those featureless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . What disturbed Susan most , after the continued clicking of the false teeth , was seeing a priest , with a collar fastened in the back and a high-cut waistcoat , owning a wife and children , and greedily pushing thin bread-and-butter into his mouth . As a Roman Catholic she had never known a priest away from confessional or altar , and therefore she had clothed this profession with a chastity and an asceticism which obviously not all its members possessed . On the walk home from the vicarage , Roger remarked : " I do not like those children . Their noses are full of ickey , and they would n't let me ride on their bicycle more than a minute . And in the nursery there were lots of funny pictures of Santa Claus sitting on a cloud . Jamie said it was God and I said it was n't . " " What is God ? " asked Susan . " God , " and the child frowned , " God is a pile of holy air . " And so the summer days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually granted England . The Hales came to take as a delightful matter of course tennisteas , insurance stamps for the servants , walking on the left of the road , bloater paste , Scotch grouse in August , and even local politics in the form of an insoluble fight as to who did and who did not have grazing rights to that patch of ground  | just oil the common . There were moments when Susan saw herself living here for the rest of her life , refusing to remember their lease expired October first . Timothy tentatively suggested that they try to extend it another month . " ' Though really these local suburbanites have nothing more to give us . I feel as if I knew them through and through . " " Tim , you could n't in three months , and they are not suburbanites ! Some of these sweet people have been living in the same house for five generations , and the rich newcomers are here for the same reason we are here ? to absorb by contact as soon as possible the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be done . It takes nine months to make a competent baby ; it takes more than that baby 's baby to make a loyal citizen . Oh , I 'm fed up with American shortcuts  --  to education , to school-girl complexions , to love ! And I never realized how fed up I was until I came to the solid peace of this dear house . Do n't you feel , Timmy , down deep , the way I feel ? " Tim lunged up and down the drawing-room where this discussion was taking place . " Sue , you 're wobbling again  --  like a penguin taking to water ? as you always do when we are about to leave one of our homes . I am beginning to wonder if you really are the adventurer you protest you are .... Do n't you understand an author must meet new people , in new places , or he just repeats himself ? " " Yes , and no . Certainly I do n't see you as a Kant living your long life philosophizing in a slumberous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny French garden , though I have heard you say repeatedly that the last thing travel did was to broaden . Judging by the professional travelers we have met they simply take their Ohio selves to London , Copenhagen , Mombassa and Vladivostok , and bring back to Ohio as priceless treasure an unreliable list of restaurants . "  | " But I am not a metaphysician or a naturalist or a merchant . I thought I was an author and a damn good one ! I did n't show you this offer from the Scandinavians to translate , and in the steamer mail this noon there was a letter from Darcy saying that there had been several offers for movie rights . " " Yaah , yaah , yaah ! " Susan made that derisive nasal sound reserved by children when they can not think of a smart answer . Timothy laughed . " Well , you may be a good author , " said Susan , " but I 'm the adventurer in this family . I 've been at it ever since I was conceived in Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was the father of a family at fifteen , I was a pollywog editor at twenty , I married a mad author , I have given birth to an infant Apollo , and I have taught an English cook to make corn pudding .

And the need to get somewhere is what caused me to come downstairs out of the silences . What about Paris ? Furrin ' langwich , cafe tables , snails , square beards , and Solo Richardson ought to be back there next week from Roumania . " There ! you 've proved my point . The first adventurous pictures you call to mind are comic paper strips , and the first person you want to see is an American newspaperman .

" " You 're right . We 'll live in France . But it is n't necessary  | for me to call upon the fishmonger ten times to get the lowdown on the ice problem . " " Tim , I think it is . When you raised your chilled cocktail after the tenth visit there would come to you the memory of the fishmonger and his voice as he recommended to his customers , sole or turbot , madam , ' the story he told you that day when his shop was empty , his subtle relation to the butcher and the iceman and the fishmonger a mile away ....

Is it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because you consciously observed it but because you were forced to live it during your most receptive and rebellious years ? I bet that 's true .... But then there were all those delicious short stories of yours ? Were they all of them only God 's Own Country characters gestating ? I wonder , with the world before us , if you will sense the difference between an automobile dealer in Bannerman and a turbanned Mussulman selling curly-toed slippers in a Tunisan bazar , or will you continue to be convinced at heart that a trader is just a trader regardless of his trade and his trading post ? . . . Timothy , your next book will show , " and Susan flopped into a chair . Timothy had listened to her with an impersonal interest . If he could n't talk about his work to Susan , then he liked to have her talk about it to him . " You may be right , " he answered thoughtfully . " Solo said if I left a message at Harry 's Bar in Paris , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . SUSAN WAS in one of her blind rages , standing in a Paris hotel bedroom in the middle of a slovenly pile of luggage , dating from that first wardrobe trunk with which they had started their wandering to Timothy 's new London leather hatbox to hold his hated and rarely used top hat . She and the luggage were in a room so low she could touch the ceiling with the palm of her hand  --  in that asphyxiating French invention known as an entresol . The furniture was heavy Empire at its gilded worst . Outside motor buses roared , taxi horns squawked , venders cried , French people talked French , so that the low room became a nightmare of gilt and noises . Susan had been in an ecstasy of reminiscence all the way from the ( pare du Nord to the hotel door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It smells the same except for the petrol fumes . Did I ever tell you I rode in my first automobile in Paris , in a yellow taxi ? ... Tim , sniff ! A sicky smell of anisette , a sour smell from the laiteries ? now there 's a smell of Coty , or is it the flower stalls ? ... Oh ! Oh ! the rue de la Chaussee d'Antin , where Father and Arthur Brentano took me one day for a filet de sole meuniere and the fat caissiere remembered me from when I was three . They never forget you in Paris , the little people do n't . I 'll find her and take Roger to see her .... And the Boulevard Haussmann beyond , where we had a flat , what was the number ? It was the year of the Exposition and so hot the mythical fish were dying in the  | Seine and Frank and I were promised death if we touched the water in the faucets . And of course it was then the Metropolitain was first opened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and babies and sit at the cool mouths of the subway stairs . I rode by chance on the second trip . Remember how New Yorkers paid hundreds of ' dollars for the privilege of the first rides on the Interborough ? But Paris was n't much interested . I miss the cabmen with the patent leather hats , and their wine-purple voices and faces .... I hope my French will come back quickly , I was so ashamed at the douane not to remember what colis meant . ... Tim , do you think my French sounds authentic or has it become twangy ? ... You 're a darling , thanks for lying .... Now there 's a beard for you and the Cafe de la Paix , lean way out , on the left , we 'll go there as soon as we 've dumped Frank , Roger I mean , heavens I 'm fifteen again .... Oh talk about the vitality of New York , it 's only the machinery which is alive , here it 's the people ! " Susan bounced in her cab seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here ? and , and with you ! " Tim smiled wanly at her . He was tired . France was all he had expected and more , perhaps too much more . In none of his imaginings of his entry into Paris , the gay , the naughty , had he ever included an English governess , a baby with very dirty hands , seventeen pieces of luggage , and even so nice a wife as Susan . If she would just stop exclaiming and explaining for a moment , and let him see for himself ! Of course she was excited to be back , but she had been so darn proprietory about the country ever since she had leaned over the side of the boat and snatched two porters from the crowd with a shrill song of " Porteu-eur , porteu-eur ! " She had answered the questions of the customs house official ; she had rather piggishly , he thought , made them group themselves at their compartment door so as to discourage others from entering ( later he admitted he was glad of the privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what to pay the steward with  | absurd black gloves , and finally had got their mountainous luggage on the tops of two frail cabs . Miss Ainley was in one cab , he , Roger and Susan in the other , and she was still exclaiming : " See , Tim , the signs of the great dressmakers I used to write about in my wage-slave days ! May I have just one dress from Jeanne Lanvin ? " Roger was doing his best to hold on to the little let-down seat as they rocketed around corners . He was tired but he was not crying . " Most kids would be whining after this long journey , " thought Timothy and he picked the child up and held him against him . Timothy could feel the weight of the small body as it confidingly relaxed . His own little son , his little nipper , as the vicar had said . He ought to see more of Roger ; if he only knew how to play games in words that Roger would understand . But later , surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a dog , a boy 's dog , and go for long walks and be friends . " Wake up , Roger darling , we 're at the hotel now , and in five seconds you 'll be in a nice white bed with  --  what would you specially like for supper tonight ? " Susan was kissing him and straightening his clothes . " Ice cream ! " Once more Susan took charge of the caravan , though she was relieved to find that Miss Ainley was proving a most competent lieutenant . " Two large rooms with twin beds , and bath in between , and on a court , " Susan announced . " For how much time will madame remain here ? " asked the manager , polite though not effusive . " I have n't an idea . But is that of importance ? You ca n't be full at this season ? " Susan was snippish . The manager was more so . " We are always very full , madame , but I think these two rooms you will find agreeable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it transpired that Susan was in one of her blind  | rages , standing in a Paris hotel bedroom on the entresol , surrounded by a slovenly pile of luggage , a disapproving governess , an ashamed husband , and a whimpering child . " How dare that worm of a clerk give us rooms like these ! We 'll die before morning of suffocation and noise ! And where is all this beastly luggage to go ? " She gave Timothy 's hatbox a kick . " We 've got to move and at once . But we 're all so tired . And I was so excited all the way from the station at being back , and now it 's all spoiled , " and she rushed over to the window , turned her back on them , and burst into tears . " Miss Ainley , " said Timothy quietly , " will you take Roger into the bathroom and wash his hands and face , and sit down peacefully for a little while ? We are all exhausted , but I am sure a change can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what I can do . " " What can you do ? You do n't speak French ! " Susan 's voice was harsh with angry sobs . " Susan , behave yourself . It is you who are spoiling our arrival in Paris , not these rooms . I have four years of Harvard French , but I have also a quaint fancy that that coldeyed manager , not clerk , speaks English as well as you do . Now snap out of this and let me find you smiling when I come back . " She continued to look out of the low-balconied window , and did not answer him . Her ego had been swelling all day with each successive proof of her superiority over him . Now it had burst , but she was not ready to apologize . Tim did not always leave her alone at this point as he should , but would argue with her . Today however the presence of Miss Ainley and Roger and his own fatigue counseled absence , and with the closing of the door , not too softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gloves , and went into the other room . " Mr. Hale will fix everything , I know , Miss Ainley , but you ca n't imagine what a phobia I have about low ceilings .  | I almost die in a berth on a train , and once I spent a freezing night on the deck of a yacht because I could not sleep in the tiny cabin where my nose almost touched the ceiling .... You did n't give Roger a drink from the faucet , did you ? " " I am afraid I did , Mrs. Hale . He was so thirsty . " " Oh but you must n't , ever ! Public water in Europe may be better than it used to be , but we must n't risk it . Always order bottled water , Evian or something . " " I 'm still thirsty , Mother . " " Have you seen a telephone , Miss Ainley ? Let 's all have tea . " " And ice cream , Mother ! " It was a warm autumn evening after dinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paix . Tim and Sue had edged into a place in the back row , protected from the scurrying waiters with their fair but false " Toute de suite , monsieur ! " " Tim , the last time I sat here with Father I had a grenadine . But tonight I am grown-up and I want something utterly French yet sincerely alcoholic . " Her eyes darted for help among the filled glasses on the tables . " I low about champagne to celebrate ? " asked Tim . " Oh no , that does n't belong here .... See that sign ? Amer picon , I like that name . " " You try it first . I 'll stick to brandy-and-soda . Garcon ! ... You tell him , Sue . " " Oui , monsieur ? " " Pour moi , amen picon , pour monsieur , un brandeesodah . " " Piton citron ? " " Mais oui .... I do n't know what I 'm getting , Tim , but I 'll try anything once . The brandee-sodah ' seemed to work , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Susannah .... Do you realize we 're actually here sitting in front of the Cafe de la Paix ? " Tim  | squeezed Sue 's hand , " and it 's all just as I pictured it except there 's not one American that I can see ! I thought they all slept here . Nothing but Frenchmen , who I 'd heard disdained the place . " " Perhaps they just came tonight to welcome us . " " Pardon , madame , " and before them was plopped a celestial blue siphon of seltzer , a handsomely labeled bottle of cognac , another bottle with evil brown contents , and , most thrilling , a small silver bucket of ice . " Where is the lemon for the amer picon ? " asked Susan . The waiter pointed to a yellow syrup in one of the glasses , and on top of it he poured the brown liquid and squirted some seltzer . " Remember , Tim , to cremate me , " and Susan sipped her first picon citron .... " It is too utterly vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hales were silent , letting the Paris which eddies about that famous corner talk to them . They were in complete harmony , his eyes smiling into hers as they picked out the same oddity : a leering Armenian whose real trade was filthier than his rugs , an insistent old hag who pushed faded wired roses in Susan 's face , the mounted policeman in his war helmet ineffectually trying to keep order in the crowd that surged back and forth across the Place de l'Opera , and everywhere stocky middle-aged men and women in the black clothes of the provincial or the very slightly more sophisticated attire of the Paris bourgeoisie , all enjoying their boulevards at the end of the working day .... At last some Americans , the two men in " business suits " with trousers sagging at the waist and low linen collars cut in long points emphasizing the immaturity of their fifty-year-old faces ; and the two women of a " ready-made " pattern testifying loudly that a copy of a French model copied fifty thousand times with Hebraic variations is but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such timid efforts to catch a waiter on the wing that Tim and Sue , old habitues  | of half an hour , wanted to help them . Eventually they were seated almost in front of the Hales , and Tim , the author , whispered : s " See what they are ordering , listen to what they are saying . " As Susan obediently craned her neck , one of the four , a woman , caught Susan 's eye , stared , and said : " Are n't you Mrs. Timothy Hale ? " A western voice . " Yes ? " Had she met them before ? " And there 's Tim Hale himself ! " A male western voice . Sue glanced quickly at Tim , but his face was as blank as hers . " I guess you do n't remember us . " The voice was annoyed . " Brown 's the name , Dr. Arthur T. Brown of Spokane . " Still no spark . This was awful . " Dr. Brown , you must forgive us . It is six years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling steadily ever since , meeting so many people , and then being naturally rather feeble-minded ? " Sue 's voice dripped with ingratiation . " Ye-e-c-s , I guess it must be pretty hard to remember everybody now that you 're a famous man  --  have n't had time yet to read your book  --  but we gave you quite a little dinner when you were passing through , my father and your father were old friends and he asked you to look us up , and I 'll never forget how surprised you were when I stopped off at the drugstore and handed out a doctor 's prescription for you for gin and vermouth . " Dawn . It was the memory of the shock of that doctor 's unethical prescription that brought the dinner party back . " Of course , I remember , " shouted Tim , " all comes back as clear as a bell . Well , it certainly is fine to see you again , and here of all places . Ca n't we somehow bring our tables closer together so we can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How long are you going to be here ? Where are you staying ? "  | Tim was no longer the dreamy spectator content to hold Sue 's hand and drink little sips . He was noisy , hearty , eager to make up for his forgetting . Their harmony was shattered . and her face stiffened into a politely enduring smile . For Tim as an author the first-night impressions of these new-worlders were invaluable . He was right ? as an author . Sue was right ? as a lover . Going back to their hotel in a cab , Susan snuggled close to Tim and sighed , " I wonder , dear , if you ought not to have seen Paris for the first time with another man , instead of submerged by family . It does take the glamor off things especially when you have a wife who slips a - cog as I did this afternoon . May I admire once more your self-control and efficiency ? The high ceilings in our new rooms are like cathedral arches lost in a blue haze .... I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tight . Hold on to me when I get out of the cab . " The Paris the Hales were to see in the next two weeks was the obvious tourist Paris , humanized by the presence of several English and Americans who knew what they called " the ropes " but who were as much strangers to the French as were the Hales . Susan hunted . in vain through the telephone book to find the few names of her father 's friends whom she remembered . An officer of the Guaranty Trust Company gave them a dinner at Ciro 's , but his wife did not ask them to her home . Before noon of their second day Tim had appeared at Harry 's Bar and the first person he had seen was Solo Richardson . Susan joined them there and between two sidecar cocktails they annexed Colonel Sweeney , that endearing member of the American Legion and wearer of a vintage velour hat , and all four hilariously lunched at the Chatham , not slighting its bar on the way in . Two chapters of " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ des Deux Mondes ? it bore the same  | relation to its original as a dark twin to its fair half  --  but literary Paris was not yet aware of the new author . So the Hales had the leisure , unbroken by telephone calls and petits bleus , to visit " historical spots " which were no less historical or thrilling because the glazed eyes of a billion tourists had passed wearily over them . With no housekeeping to do , with the efficient Miss Ainley taking Roger to the Bois or the Champs Elysecs or the Tuileries gardens , Susan made a business of sightseeing , for though she had seen it all before in her childhood she saw it now afresh with the eyes of Timothy 's wife . Tim was willing enough if she let him off at the twilight hour to join Solo , and as that was the hour she liked best to be with Roger , both were content . Susan planned : We must eat , and Paris is the palate of the gustatory world . Therefore , let us do our daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louvre toward an entrecute at the Cafe de la Regence , and walk away from a cheese souffle to the Palais Royal . We 'll save the Beeuf a la Mode for the single  --  oh , very single ! ? night at the Theatre Francais , and Le Cabaret near the Rond Point for chicken pie after mass at the Russian church . On steamer mail days we 'll take along our yellow manila envelopes given us by the pretty girl at the Guaranty Trust and read and lunch at La Biche , beloved of that superb woman writer , Colette . If I can persuade Tim to climb to the top of Notre Dame ? how funny , it means Our Lady and I never thought of that before  --  I 'll tell him Victor Hugo 's tale of Esmeralda and the goat and the hunchback as my father told it to me , and I 'll point out to him far below the Rotisserie Perigourdine where very , very soon , my exhausted one , we 'll be eating trufie sous la cendre washed down , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chateau La Rose . We could lunch on one of the platforms of the Eiffel Tower , but did n't some one say the food was hot-doggish ? Very well  | then , we 'll follow the taxi-driver and feed beside him for six franc s he Pantheon and the Musee de Cluny the same day . Shall we choose the Trianons with one of its regional dishes or shall we eat almost anything at Foyot 's ? I want so to see the chastity belts at the Cluny , but if I do n't find them by myself how can I , chastely , ask the guard ? All of which sounded very knowing of Susan , but for years she had been collecting , rather pathetically , lists made out by bon vivants or penny-a-liners , and . now was her chance ... Timothy placidly ate his way through Paris . It was part of the sightseeing that they should spend sev. eral evenings at the Dome and the Rotonde , those Greenwich Village tea-rooms on the Left Bank . In the days of " Trilby " there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1921 , with the difference that they were not all Americans playing at being French artists . On their first visit the Hales had sat quietly on the sidewalk , cool though the night was , drinking their little drinks and feeling rather lonely at a party where every one called the other by his first name . At last they were noticed by a young man , equally spotty of face and lapels , who swayed over their marble-topped table and accusingly asked , " You 're Timothy Hale , are n't you ? ... You do n't remember me , but you turned down a novel of mine once , said I did n't know what I was talking about . Neither did you . But you 've put it over , have n't you , with a commercial best-seller ? Why do n't you come and live on the Rive Gauche and write a good book , now that you can afford to ? " The man was drunk ; should they take offense ? " Say , would you like to meet some real writers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beckon in half a dozen directions . " Come on , boys and girls , God 's Own Country ' has condescended to call on us. "  | " Tim , this is preposterous , this gratuitous insulting . Let 's go at once . " " No , sit down ! It 's going to be interesting , though I hope to sock my pimply friend in the jaw before we leave . " Like chickens answering the farmyard call of " heeeere , cutcutcutcutcutcut ! " men and women to the number of twelve came running and began shoving tables together and grouping themselves around the Hales . Ragged introductions were made , and some one insisted that at once they drink to Hale 's success . That was as good an excuse as another . A fine , two fines , one grand marnier , two cointreau , one green chartreuse , three fines were brought and Susan was fascinated by the precision with which the waiter filled the tiny glasses to the brim without slopping over into the saucers . One anemic male in a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Timothy if he would contribute to the first number of a magazine conceived but not born . " We ca n't quite decide on the name . I wanted Illusion ' for that 's what life is after all . " " My choice is Strabism ' ? I 've never heard it used before , and it 's so suggestive ? the eyes turned inward ! " This from a gray-haired female in a blue beret . " Why not Cock-Eyed ' ? " suggested Timothy . " The meaning is the same but the words more colloquial . " No one smiled , except Susan . She turned and looked squarely at the man who had sat himself at her right . He wore the starched linen collar and conservative tie of the successful American business man , but he had dandruff on his blue coat , and a transfixing yellow-and-green handkerchief drooped from his pocket . " Mrs. Hale , how about another lil round of drinks ? " Susan did not know she had become hostess to this uninvited gathering . " How about it yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like an intelligent wench , tell me honestly , you do n't think your husband has written a good book , do you ? " " Oddly enough , I do . " Her voice was cold and final . On the other side of the tables an English girl was beating time with her liqueur glass held between paint-stained fingers , and singing rather well something about a poor lass whose " hair hung down in ring-a-lets . " Every one seemed to know the chorus . Susan 's chair was joggled . Timothy was rising , his fists clenched . The spotty young man had also risen , but his fists were not clenched . Said Tim : " You and your friends are self-invited guests . Most of you are drunk . I permitted you to remain because I thought you might be amusing . You are not amusing . Go , or I shall knock you down . " " Citoyens , citoyennes , we are not wanted by the bourgeoisie . Let us go and seek a more amiable best-seller , " and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cafe on the opposite corner . The others followed . Only the English girl who had been singing cast a smile of apology at Susan . The Hales sat facing the empty chairs and piles of empty saucers . Timothy 's voice trembled as he said : " This makes me want to go back to Bannerman on the next boat . God , what lice ! ... And yet , and yet , they 're pathetic , whistling down the wind because they are poor , poor in talent , poor in pocket , poor in generosity . They actually seem to hate me , little Timmy Hale . " He sighed . " Garcon , l'addition . " " Yes , sir , right away , sir . " " Sue , I 'm tired of pavements . I feel like writing this morning . In fact , I 've been feeling guilty for days . " " All right . The remaining family will declare a holiday .  | We 'll see you at dinner .... Miss Ainley , we 're going on an all-day bust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever you say , Mrs. Hale . " " But say ! " " Montmartre . " Up the slope the taxi ground until it reached the Place du Tertre . " Is n't it sweet ? Like a remote village . First of all we 'll see the Cathedral and the view , then we 'll lunch . We could go to Le Lapin Agile , deliciously absurd name , but I think I prefer a chicken and a salad at Le Coucou . Let us order it first and then see the Sacre 0:cur .... Heavens , where 's the baby ? " Nowhere in the noon-day square was the rose-coated figure of the child . " But , Mrs. Hale , he was holding my hand just a second ago , " wailed Miss Ainley . You go down that street and I 'll go this way , they are practically the only exits to the square , unless he is in one of the shops ? look everywhere ! " Susan commanded . Kidnapping was her first thought . But why ? Except that he looked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trimmed with beaver . Susan 's eyes were like searchlights . They darted toward the circular tin structure at the turn of the street . Even in her panic the cyclorama of legs amused her . Corduroy legs , black cloth legs , tiny pink legs in white socks and white shoes ? Roger 's legs ! Impossible ! Her instinct was to dash into the vespasienne and drag out her child . But of course she could not , she must wait . Relieved by the sight of those familiar pink legs she could smile at the absurdity of the situation . She retired to the shadow of a doorway . Through the tin opening came the corduroy trousers , then appeared Roger , struggling with the buttons of his infinitesimal linen pants . He looked pleased with himself . Susan knew she must be careful not to destroy  | his confidence in this first manifestation of independence . " Hello there , Roger . Miss Ainley and I are going to order lunch . Chicken and salad and some fruit . Like that ? After lunch we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride on a fat pig merry-go-round if there 's a fair going on on the Clichy . " Roger knit his brows and stared , and looked so much like Susan when she encountered the unfamiliar that she started to laugh . " It 's very smelly in there and there is a waterfall for each person . And that man going down the street helped me with my buttons . " " That was nice of him , darling . Let 's find Miss Ainley . " Timothy was enchanted by this episode . He felt for the first time a sex link with his child . Needless to say the child did not respond ? did not suddenly burst forth as Tim may have expected into a mature discussion with his father of French individualism versus American standardization . Roger unfortunately continued to remain a baby . But this one day at work on the new novel in a Paris hotel elicited : " Sue , I ca n't work in this town . Too damn noisy . Also I 'm drinking too much . Between the normal wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dear Americans I am in a hazy condition most of the time . Let 's beat it ! " " Where ? " " Most anywhere . Is n't Europe marvelous , all the exciting places within a few hours ' distance ? What about Rome for the winter ? " " Tim , I 'd adore it , but ? " " Do n't tell me you have grown attached to this hotel ? " " No , silly , but I have ordered some clothes ? a knock  | your-eye-out hooped frock from Lanvin and a rose-and-purple effect from Poiret , and I have fittings on both next week . So ? why do n't you go to Rome ahead of us ? you know the ambassador there , Dick Child  --  and enjoy the city as a bachelor , not as a pater familias ? Find us a flat for the winter , ask about fresh milk , and wire me when you are ready . Yes ? "  | CHAPTER XXV , , , , , , , , , , , , , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , , , , , , , , 1 , , , , , , 1 , , , " CI-IARMING suite at Hotel Russie meet you fifteen ten train Thursday Eager to see you love Tim . " ... " Tim darling ! Is Rome fun ? Has Dick Child been nice ? Is Maude as pretty as ever ? Could n't you find an apartment ? Wo n't living in an hotel all winter be awfully expensive ? What about fresh milk for Roger ? " All the way from Paris , delayed five chilly hours by a band of rising young men called Fascisti who , armed to the teeth , suspiciously examined her tickets at every station , Susan had been glorifying her arrival at the " charming suite " of Tim 's telegram . At the station he was nervous and evasive , and his usual enthusiasm at seeing her was forced , she thought . Alas , journeys may end in lovers ' meetings , but not when one of the lovers was hung about with a governess , a baby and three porters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sue , at the studio of an American family I 've met here , two of the secretaries from the embassy , the embassy 's pet newspaperman , clever fellow , an Italian archeologist , they said , and some others . " " But , Tim , wo n't it be too late after we 've had dinner , and that long delay on the train was pretty tiring ? " " That 's all right . I telephoned them and they said we could wander in any time . By the way , we wo n't be able to get that suite I telegraphed about for two days , they 're pretty crowded , but we have rooms for the night . "  | . So that was why he was nervous and evasive . Was he afraid of her ? Her stormy anger when disappointed ? Yes , there was actually fear in his eyes as he waited for her answer . Steady now , Susan . " I 'm sorry . Have you been doing much work ? " Her voice was too polite . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say never mind , dear . But she did n't want to . She was tired and shivery and slightly sick from hunger , and it had been exhausting entertaining Roger on that long journey , and she had that same feeling after a separation of seeing him again for the first time , of reweighing him , and over-emphasizing an awkward gesture , a soiled pocket handkerchief . Who was she to be passing everlasting judgment ? But she was made like that . It was dark as they drove in unfriendly silence through the streets , but the hotel was gay with music and a dazzle of brocaded throne chairs and low black marble tables dotted with coffee cups and liqueur glasses , a tiny bar crowded with laughing American girls and Italian officers . Up two steps down two steps , smell of a tomatoey sauce , twisty corridors , glimpses of gardens , more steps , what a jolly place , not a bit like a hotel . The volatile Susan revived . " I shall adore living here . " She smiled ingratiatingly at Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone wall , like cells . She sank on the bed , a Christian martyr . " Say it ! " snarled Timothy . " Our hotel arrivals are not what I would call a succes furieux . Not room even for the doormat marked welcome : And the scent of flowers overwhelms me . " ( There were , of course , no flowers . ) " I had hoped we might dine quietly up here , but you could n't squeeze a tray in here , much less a table . What have you been doing all these weeks ? I do n't suppose you 've had time to find out about the fresh milk either . " " I ca n't , and wo n't , put up with your badgering ! " and  | Timothy was gone . Susan continued to sit on the edge of the bed engulfed by a despair more bitter because it was partly of her own making . Was all this glorious adventure of seeing new places together to be reduced to bickering about hotel rooms ? Oh , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so soon ? Smile sweetly now . Miss Ainley was asking : " What do you wish us to do ? " Smile , smile .... How dreadful this everlasting trying to keep the respect of the people whom you paid to respect you ! " Try the button marked cameriere ? I think it means waiter . Mr. Hale has planned a party for me later this evening , so let 's just have something on a tray . These are only temporary rooms , our apartment for the winter will be ready in a few days . I hope it overlooks the garden , do n't you ? It seems a gay hotel , I think it will be fun , do n't you ? " Susan was appealing to Miss Ainley for strength but Yorkshire wears not its heart upon its fustian sleeve , and Miss Ainley 's " It seems so " was noncommittal . Susan went into the bathroom , closed the door , sat down on the lavatory , laid her head on the marble washstand beside , and cried silently . An hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poiret which she had put in her bag to surprise Tim with at once , she was waiting in torturing suspense for his problematical return . Suppose he should punish her by not coming hack all night ? What would Miss Ainley think ? What had she thought of his absence from dinner ? What would the party think , except that he would not hesitate to go and enjoy himself and explain she was too exhausted to come ? And then there was a knock at the door . Her body was all waiting . The maid to turn down the beds . Susan laid on the fresh triangle of sheet the silk pajamas she had bought him at Charvet 's , a clear apple green that would mellow with washing .... A striding down the hall , a blowing of the nose , a rat-tat-tat-tat , " Ready for , the party , Susie ? I think I 've blasted that manager with the ' two gold bracelets into some kind of  | activity , and we may get into the apartment tomorrow . " Susan slipped her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his waistcoat and lifted her face up to him . " Old Satin-back , I 'm so humble . " He did not kiss her but placed a hand over her mouth . " Not one word from you . The studio 's just around the corner . Jolly people , you 'll like ' em . At least I think you 'll like ' em . " " Please , Tim , not one word from you either . " Not a via but a vicolo was the alley where the studio hid . It was almost lightless and the entrance , like stable doors , was emphatically closed and unwelcoming . But the Hales had grown used to this kind of facade in Paris and they patiently waited for the concierge to finish his newspaper or rise from her bed and let them in . A studio only in so far as the room was enormous . A grand piano in one corner with a static blonde playing soft syncopation , and three dark Italians wriggling their bodies in what they thought was jazz . A vivacious blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket . A woman hauntingly suggestive of the two blondes approaching Tim and Sue . " So this is Susie ! I 've heard so much about you in the past two weeks from Tim . Did you have trouble with the Fascisti coming down ? Are you quite comfortable at the Russic ? Nicest hotel in Rome , I think . Most personality . Be sure to get rooms on the garden . Will you have a strega or a cointrean or a whiskey-and-soda ? " " Mrs. Oliver , may I snatch you off in a corner for five minutes and get your sage advice about my interview tomorrow morning with the manager with two bracelets ? Tim says you have lived in Italy for years and that you will be a mother , or rather , a charming young aunt to me . " Mrs. Oliver approved of Susan 's voice , her frock , and her tact . Not what she had expected somehow . Humph , not bad  | people to cultivate . Authors ' wives were either too mouse-like and dull , or too loquacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important as their husbands . " See Madame Dombre at the Russie , if she is there . A gracious and discriminating woman and the heart of the U. N. I. T. I. ? chain of hotels including the incomparable Villa d'Este at Como . Make a weekly arrangement covering board and lodging and heating , and be prepared for a weekly knockdown fight with the cashier about extras . I 'd keep a record of every bottle of wine I ordered and its price , and have a fixed weekly tip for the seventeen million people who will serve you . " " I 'm overwhelmed and bankrupt , " wailed Susan . " No , it sounds awful , but it 's just a universal system . In fact , you will come to look forward to the weekly fight with the cashier . It is always amicable and ends in triumphant laughter for one side or the other . Total damages , forty-five lire . " " Mrs. Oliver , you are as wise as you are charming , and now may I meet some of these delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries , all the gentlemen bowed from the waist and kissed her hand . The only man who focused on Susan 's retina was the archeologist , who was older than the others and slightly resentful of his frivolous surroundings . He snapped at the back of her right hand and turned away sharply . One man left the piano . " I am eggsited to meet thhe beeyutiful wife of thhe grreat American author . I am very young and stupid and speak Eenglish very batly . I admire so everything from thhe United States . " A baby face , a baby mustache , a man 's eyes . Who was this sweet idiot ? " Pleass , you make me so enchanted if you perrmit me to come for the tea tomorrow ? "  | " And why ? " asked Susan wondering what it was all about . " I have wreeten a poem to a beeyutiful woman . Until thees meenute she have been a ideal now she ees ? bella donna ? you ! " Thought Susan , " The tiny man is lying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foyer off the studio Timothy was forcing against the wall the vivacious blonde sister of the family . Over the black head of the amorous juvenile talking to her Susan watched . Timothy was about to , yes , he had kissed the blonde . How casually she took it . Used to kisses , Tim 's kisses ? Susan 's eyes flittered about the room and rested upon the calm gaze of the archeologist . He also had seen and he gave her a soft protective smile , with no teeth showing . What a nice man , he seemed to know that she was suffering . She must get away from here quickly . Timothy strolled back into the room . " Tim , I 'm dying on my feet . If you want to stay on , stay , but I 'll disgrace you in five seconds by curling up on the floor and snoring . " " Right you are . Mrs. Oliver , I 'm taking my comatose wife to bed . Jolly evening , ' bye , Clare . " " Tim , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to tell you that I saw you kiss the younger Oliver girl . " Susan faced Timothy in the dark alley . " What of it ? " Tim was on the defensive . " Exactly . There is a what of it . To kiss her in front of a wife you have brought around to her apartment for the first time is fairly insulting , do n't you think ? You have doubtless seen a lot of her while I was in Paris , and nw in spite of my arrival you want to go on seeing a lot m re of her ? " Tim nodded . There was no shame in his face .  | " And yet in your telegram to me you said Eager to see you love . ' Did n't you mean that ? " " No . " No .... The syllable fell on her heart and stopped its beating . I lc had lied to her about his love for her . From now on she would suspect his every " no " and " yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sure had been there unshaken by quarrels or intervening miles . This was a ( rids . She recognized it . She felt struck to the earth , then a realization of pain . Like a cripple she gathered her broken limbs , and asked slowly , " What shall we do now ? " " Nothing , of course . " Then suddenly there arose in Susan a great wave , a tidal wave , bigger than either of them and this trivial blonde called Clare , a wave of fury , the oldest fury in the world , that of the woman scorned . She lifted her breast , stiffened her broad shoulders , and with the flat of her right hand struck a man for the first time in her life . Timothy recoiled sharply , his hand to his reddened cheek . " With your cold complacent ' no ' you have just committed murder . You have killed in me the trust in you which I have been building up since I first met you " ? she paused to calculate ? " nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you again . I could tear your face with my nails and delight in the channels of blood . This may be jealousy or it may be only wounded vanity . I must give myself time to find out . You can not sleep in my room tonight . I must be alone . Perhaps that little blonde bitch will take you in ! " For the first time in her life she had said " bitch . " Timothy was maddeningly calm . " She is not a bitch and she kissed me only because she happens to be in love with me . " " With you ? How too funny ! " Susan 's laughter was shrill , slightly insane . " Admire you , yes , as an author , but love you as a man ? what woman could possibly ? "  | " Stop it ! You are working yourself into a state of hysteria and you will say a lot of things you will regret . Go upstairs and go to bed , and I 'll be up in an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until five o'clock next day did Timothy allow Susan a chance to speak to him about that which filled both their minds . After breakfast Madame Dombre appeared and suggested an arrangement of four communicating rooms , each with its balcony overhanging that lovely garden which climbs the Pincian Hill . The corner room for Susan , the next the drawing-room , then a room for Miss Ainley and the fourth for Roger . Timothy had decided to have a room by himself in the opposite wing , so that he might work in more seclusion , he said . " And see Clare Oliver more easily , " thought Susan . As Madame Dombre , in a modest black frock , bustled around the drawing-room evicting certain pieces of furniture and ordering others to be brought , Roger went up to her and asked : " Are you the maid ? " The able woman looked at the child thoughtfully and then answered with simplicity , " Yes , I am in a way that . My desire is to serve and serve well . " Over Roger 's yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's domesticity would have vibrated to this opportunity of making a winter home in a Roman hotel , of choosing such stately furniture as a yellow brocaded sofa , rose embossed velvet chairs , marble-topped tea-tables and consoles , gold mirrors , and a walnut desk , and " we 'll leave that corner empty for a small upright piano . " She would have been charmed when in the midst of pushing things about , vases full of roses arrived " with the compliments of the management . " But all the time she was thinking , " What profit to make a home when the hearth fire is dead ? "  | At five Timothy turned up and remarked , " You 've worked enough for today . Let 's go over to the Caffe Greco for a drink . " " I 'll meet you downstairs , in that room facing the entrance . " She wanted to dress herself in seclusion , and approach him as a stranger , a pretty one , she hoped . Unconsciously she was beginning to compete with Clare Oliver and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible Timothy might fall in love . " Is that one of the dresses you bought in Paris ? That is beautiful embroidery on the sleeves , " he observed as they started walking down the Via Babuino . At least he saw her dress if he did not see her . The Cage Greco on the Via Condotti has seen a century and a half of artists come and go . It was natural that Timothy should feel at home in that low quiet room full of smoke and the considering faces of chess-players . They had just received their vermouth with seltzer when the archeologist entered and asked permission to join them . " I sleep near here but I live mostly at the Greco . Are you settling yourself at the Russie ? " he turned to Susan with the same soft protective smile of the night before . " Some day soon it would give me great pleasure to take you to the ruins of Ostia Mare . I have been doing some work there and it might be more interesting if I were your guide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us do it very soon , " answered Susan . " Mare means sea , does n't it ? " " Yes , Rome was once a sea port and Ostia full of ships . ... Mr. Hale , I think we have met before , at the English Speaking Union dinner in London , when you gave a fine brave ' speech I thought about the differences between England and America . I have never been to your country , but I have read this great book of yours , and I have also lived in England , and I grow weary of the polite lies the two countries  | tell each other at public dinners . Your speech was most refreshing . " Timothy was pleased . " Mr. Uh ? I 'm afraid I did not get your name at the Olivers ' last night ? " " Andrea Palladio Venzo , named you see after the great Renaissance architect by my hopeful mother . But unfortunately I have always been Tore interested in fallen old stones than in erecting new ones . " He spoke so gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Susan forgot that she and Timothy were enemies , and they all three exchanged easy phrases until Professor Venzo arose to go . " How about next Sunday for our excursion to Ostia ? The ruins will be closed to the public , but I can use my permit , and we shall be undisturbed . Then we can lunch at a little trattoria that I know overlooking the sea . " " The Mediterranean ? " interrupted Susan . He nodded . " How thrilling that sounds ! " " Yes , to me , too , always , though I have sailed on it often . I am unfortunately a poor man , and I have no motor car , but to go in the omnibus is not bad and perhaps its foreignness will amuse you . It is not at all like the Russie , " and he smiled slyly at both of them and was gone . " What a sweet , sweet man , " said Susan . " And yet not at all effeminate , " agreed Timothy . " Did you notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I thought he limped a little . Perhaps forty , eyes brown but not the pansy velvet kind . Lord , what a difference between him and those cavalry popinjays at the Russie bar . I hope we meet some more Italians like him . We might take Clare Oliver along with us on Sunday . " Crash ! They were back in the dark alley of the night before and Susan had just struck Timothy for the first time . " Timothy , all day long we have carefully ignored last  | night 's affair . I think the time has come to discuss it , do n't you ? " She made an effort to keep her voice casual . " I suppose so , though I was hoping you 'd have the common sense to continue to ignore it . " " Ignore your flat-footed statement that you were not glad to see me , and you ignore my blow ? " " The main issue seems to be that you saw me kiss the girl . I have been kissing girls off and on ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing men . " " But , Timmy , Timmy , I have n't been ! I have n't kissed a man since that rainy afternoon when I publicly promised to love you for better or worse . " " More fool you . " There was no answer to this . Had she been a fool , or had she been living up to a one-sided ideal ? " But , Timmy , we have always told each other everything , seemed to tell each other everything , you have been father and mother and God to me , and now  --  oh it is impossible you have been lying to me all these years ! " Susan shaded her eyes with her hand so that the chess-players might not see her tears . " No , I have not been lying to you all these years . I have loved you to the limit of my capacity but you have shown me repeatedly that that capacity was not enough . Not always in words , though you 'd hardly be called a silent woman , but with that polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties , and my table manners . Do you remember that first picnic of ours when I met you in the Grand Central Station dressed in an old suit and a cap because I did n't dare risk spoiling my only decent other one , and you looked at me as if I were a filthy beggar clawing for alms at royalty 's cloak ? remember ? At that moment something warned me you were not the mate for me , and then your cold eyes softened ? in pity , I suppose  --  and I was glad to forget .... Sometimes I think the only thing of mine which has found favor in your
