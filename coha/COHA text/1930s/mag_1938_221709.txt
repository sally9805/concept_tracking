One afternoon last week a spare , bronzed man , clad in faded blouse and overalls , was trudging along a dirt road two miles outside Yellow Springs , Ohio , when a reporter pulled up in a car alongside . <P> " It 's 2:30 , " the reporter grinned . " Want a lift ? " <P> " No , thanks . " grinned back TVA Chairman Arthur Ernest Morgan . " I 'm just exercising . " <P> In Washington , an hour and a half after Chairman Morgan thus defied the third and final dead line set by the President for withdrawing or supporting his public charges against his fellow directors , Harcourt Morgan and David Eli Lilienthal ( TIME , March 28 ) , a band of interested reporters crowded noisily into the President 's circular office for their regular White House press conference . When they had lined up around his desk , Franklin Roosevelt began to read a letter he had just dispatched to Chairman Morgan : <P> " As a result of the hearings held before me on March 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inform you that I feel obliged to remove , and do hereby remove you as member and chairman of the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority . This removal is to become effective as and from March 23 , 1938 . ... " <P> The President thereupon went on to announce 1 ) that the new TVA chairman would be Vice Chairman Harcourt A. Morgan , and 2 ) that he was sending Congress , to do with as that body wished , the 110-page transcript of his hearings of the three TVA directors . Moreover , said the President to the assembled press , the President was tired of reading that the White House had been bringing pressure to bear against a Congressional investigation of TVA . So incensed was he , in fact , by this charge that he wanted the reporters to put on the record his statement that any special writer or columnist who had suggested it had " made it up out of whole cloth . " <P> Surprise . In Congress , where Senate Majority Leader Barkley and Speaker Bankhead had been working like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TVA , this announcement that they had been working independently of White House orders was regarded as news indeed . Even more surprising did it seem when Leader Barkley , setting to work just as efficiently in the opposite direction , promptly produced his own resolution for investigating TVA , rushed it through the Senate . To pacify the House , Leader Barkley compromised on a joint investigating committee of five Representatives and five Senators , to be provided with full authority and a $50,000 expense budget . Rabidly pro-TVA blocs in both Houses were pleased that the committee was directed to investigate not only the administration of TVA but also activities of hostile power companies .
