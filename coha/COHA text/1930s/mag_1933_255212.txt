People , thousands and thousands of people , more people than there are in Indianapolis and St. Louis and Birmingham , Ala. combined , jam-packed the stone-cliffed canyon of Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue for half a day last week . Three out of every ten New Yorkers were there , 2,000,000 strong . They fainted , they cheered , their feet hurt , their clothes got mussed . At 58th Street their sheer bulk bulged through splintering plate glass windows . The Governor 's motorcycle escort rode one down . A pack of them upturned a policeman and his screaming horse . There never had been so many people gathered anywhere in the nation since Armistice Day . Nobody in town , not even the blind news dealers and the invalids and sick folk in their beds-for the bands brayed ten solid hours-will soon forget New York 's NRA parade . <P> For hours the side streets around sunny Washington Square were bursting with marchers waiting their turn in line . While they waited many of them visited speakeasies , got tiddledy . There were a quarter-million of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clerks , 1,000 barbers , 35,000 city employes , 6,000 cinema workers led by Al Jolson , 5,000 oil workers led by Walter Teagle , metal workers , hatters , florists , waitresses , soda jerkers . Every guild , every trade and calling was on hand to honor the Blue Eagle . that hopeful bird with lightning in his claw . <P> " Well , " said Grover Whalen , local NRAdministrator , just before 2 o'clock , " forward march ! " <P> Up the Avenue chattered a smoky-tailed vanguard of motorcycle police . Out stepped spectacled Major General Dennis E. Nolan , commander of the 2nd Corps Area and Marshal of the parade . Along came Administrator Whalen , who once was Police Commissioner . Behind them , on the parade 's lone official float , rode two symbolic beauties , " Miss Liberty " and " Miss NRA , " the Misses Elise &; Doris Ford of Brooklyn , Howard Chandler Christie 's models . When the head of the parade reached the Public Library at 42nd Street , Grover Whalen and General Nolan joined General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bag-jowled Mayor O'Brien on the reviewing platform . <P> First came the troops , their uniforms a martial palette . Militiamen in grey &; white from the " Old Seventh " Regiment ; the jist Infantry in blue &; white ; the 102nd Engineers in scarlet ; the 102nd Medical Unit in maroon ; the " Old Sixty-Ninth " in blue with green facings ; the " Washington Grays " in grey with flashing sabres . Cheerful CCC workers livened their olive drab uniforms with sprigs of hemlock in their caps . Their banner announced : " We Do Our Part For The NRA ; We Work In The Woods For $1 A Day . " <P> The city 's pressmen , publishers and advertisers had a band led by a dancing Indian in a war bonnet ( see p. 50 ) . Walter Damrosch was with the radio people ; little old Charles Winninger led the actors . Samuel ( " Roxy " ) Rothafel 's costumed choristers from Radio City cut capers on the asphalt . Paramount had four imitation Marx Brothers and six Mae Wests . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly 50 pigeons back to Washington with greetings to the President . The Stock Exchange crowd had a band of Scotch pipers . The Cotton Exchange people had a band which just played " Dixie. "
