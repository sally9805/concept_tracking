MR . MULLINER SPEAKING- P. G. Wodehouse-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> " ' Here you are , sir , ' he said . ' Here 's your rat . A little the worse for wear , this sat is , I 'm afraid , sir . A gentleman happened to step on it . You ca n't step on a nat , ' he said , sententiously , ' not without hurting it . That tat is not the yat it was . ' " <P> Author Pelham Grenville Wodehouse , in his way , is a master of musical-comedy dialog , especially in the dialect of the stage Englishman of very high or low degree . Mr. Mulliner Speaking is a collection of his sprightly tales : the narrator in each case is the affably reminiscent Mr. Mulliner , who holds forth to his jaw-dropped cronies in the bar of the Angler 's Rest . In every case the hero , or the goat , is some pinheaded nephew or vague cousin of Mr. Mulliner 's : the vicissitudes related are as improbable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Cedric , onetime gnu-hunter , all-time bore , is shot by the vindictive Charlotte ; Archibald wins a bride by his one accomplishment , the imitation of a just-successful hen ; Roland gets into terrible trouble because a snake has been put in somebody else 's bed-and so on . When Mr. Mulliner is speaking , no one else can open his mouth-or even wants to , except for the occasional , irrepressible guffaw . <P> Author Wodehouse , 48 , has published 20 or 30 books , he can not remember which . As well known for his musical comedy librettos as for his books , he once wrote five at once , which were produced simultaneously . He is an Englishman , lives in London . Other books : Fish Preferred , Money for Nothing , Divots , Meet Mr. Mulliner , The Small Bachelor , Carry On , Jeeves.
