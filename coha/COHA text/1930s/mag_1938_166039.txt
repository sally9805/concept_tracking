" At the meeting at Gresham College tonight . . . there was a pretty experiment of the blood of one dog let out . . . into the body of another on one side , while all his own run out on the other side . The first died upon the place , and the other very well , and likely to do well . " Thus wrote Samuel Pepys in 1666 . <P> Last fortnight a similar and even prettier experiment was described by Dr. William Thalheimer of Manhattan , and Drs . Donald Young Solandt and Charles Herbert Best of Toronto , in The Lancet , British medical journal . They reported removing the kidneys from a dog , thus preventing him from excreting the nitrogenous poisons carried in his blood stream . Several days later , when his blood was filled with urea , they anesthetized him , connected an artery and vein to a vein and artery of a healthy , anesthetized dog . The small connecting pipes were attached to a specially designed pump which exchanged more than six quarts of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a phosphorus compound found in the liver ) was introduced into the blood to prevent coagulation . No change was made in the blood volume of either animal , but the two blood streams were thoroughly mixed until the urea of the nephrectomized ( kidney-less ) dog was distributed fairly evenly throughout the blood of both animals . The normal dog rapidly excreted the urea of the nephrectomized dog . Ten experiments were reported . In practically all cases the kidney-lender made a rapid recovery . In many cases the nephrectomized dog was in good condition at the conclusion of the experiment . <P> Said the physicians : " There are perhaps some circumstances which might justify the use of exchange transfusions in the human species . However , application to human subjects should be considered only after a thorough study of the technique and full appreciation of the many attendant dangers . " <P> Not yet , however , were the doctors willing even to suggest any use ( such as temporary relief of uremia ) to which the method might eventually be put . But Mr. Pepys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tread , ventured 272 years ago to draw a conclusion from the experiment he described . Said he : " This did give occasion to many pretty wishes , as of the blood of a Quaker to be let into an Archbishop , and such like ; but . . . may , if it takes , be of mighty use to man 's health , for the amending of bad blood by borrowing from a better body .
