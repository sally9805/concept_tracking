Last week the stockholders of Container Corp . of America received a printed postcard from their company , beginning with the well-worn refrain : " It is our policy to give our stockholders full information at all times . . . . " Prepared to slog through the usual corporate platitudes , Container stockholders opened their eyes wide at what followed : " We recognize that while matters of considerable importance will be submitted at the Annual Stockholders ' Meeting in Chicago it may be difficult or impossible for many of our Eastern stockholders to attend this meeting because of distances involved . Therefore , I cordially invite you , or your duly accredited representative , to meet with me ... on Tuesday , May 26th , at the New York offices of the Company . . . . Please understand that this will be a wholly informal meeting- simply for the purpose of acquainting you more thoroughly with some of the major subjects which , a week later , will be submitted and officially acted upon at the Stockholders ' Meeting in Chicago . " Signed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Container Corp . ' s suave , able , young president . Unlike many a chief executive , President Paepcke does not make it a first principle to stay as far away from stockholders as possible . For one thing , he has less reason to make himself scarce . Container Corp . is the biggest maker of paperboard shipping containers and cartons in the U. S. Last year Container earned $1,238,000-its best showing since 1927 , which was the first full year of the company 's life . What President Paepcke will discuss with his stockholders this week is a longer step forward for Container than his cordial postcard . He proposes to issue 200,000 shares of new $50 par preferred stock . More than one-half of this issue will be sold at once , the rest later . With the proceeds President Paepcke will enter a field new to his company . Container will build a big kraft mill in Fernandina , Fla. having an annual capacity of some 100,000 tons . From kraft is made liner board for shipping containers , which account for about one-half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now imports some 32,000 tons of kraft pulp annually , mostly from Scandinavia . In the South pulp can be made for $18 a ton from slash pine . To smart President Paepcke this means that his new Florida mill will cut Container 's kraft costs by $10 per ton , save the company some $320,000 per year as its own best customer . If President Paepcke can sell the rest of the new mill 's output to other kraft users on the same $10 per ton profit margin , as he hopes to do , he will have another $650,000 yearly to add to Container 's earnings . Thus with relatively low production costs and modern machinery , the new mill is expected to earn nearly as much as all present Container plants put together . Not only is Container 's move shrewd operating tactics but it is also shrewd merchandising . Into liner board for its shipping containers now go four parts waste paper , one part kraft pulp . More kraft means less weight . To many a big container customer an ounce less weight in its shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Container operates 13 plants dotted throughout the East from Natick , Mass , to Cincinnati , from Philadelphia to Chicago . To some 8,000 customers last year went $20,181,000 worth of shipping containers , folding boxes
