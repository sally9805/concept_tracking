txt We Are Urged to Action Participation in the League of Nations Viewed as the Way to Peace To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Probably never before in the history of civilization has there been a greater or more widespread appreciation of the horrors of war and of the fact that noncombatant populations can no longer feel that they are immune to its un- - speakable consequences . The present war in Europe is so delayed in its immediate onset that people the world over are having time to consider its causes and analyze its probabilities . Under these circumstances it seems reasonable to assume that no combatant government or any ruling authority would venture at this time to refuse consideration to any peace proposal that could be initiated . Regardless of the varied opinions of individuals and the unfortunate partisan controversies of the past , there can be no reasonable doubt in the minds of thinking people that the time when universal peace on this planet came - nearer to becoming a reality was when the League of Nations was functioning at its best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiescence Of the League of Nations , all with considerable - degree of virtue and within the range of possibility . But in the League of Nations we have an organization probably better known universally than any - other and with a foundation and organization already established . Therefore it seems within reason that herein lies the shortest , most intelligent and most feasible approach to immediate peace that exists today . The indifference of this country in the past was a potent cause of the League 's failure . But at present , when the in- ' evitability of our eventual and unavoidable entrance in the present war is appreciated by all of us , is it not within the range of reason that this country should now stand in the vanguard for peace and offer its best offices and cooperation for the re-establishment and reactivation of this organization ? The - men and women who organized it have made possible the correction of any unfavorable sections and the introduction - of new ones . We hear it said that America should first put its own house in order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own house in order when disorder is rampant in the world . Isolation , because of the ingeniousness of man , has become an impossibility and an undesirability . Today , and before it is too late , is America 's opportunity and our President or Congress the logical point of issue . Only the widespread insistence of the people is needed to set the wheels of sanity and progress again in motion . America should lead . Is she equal to the task ? I believe she is . J. WALTER SCHIRMER , M. D. Needham , Mass. , Nov. 28 , 1939 . Duty Held Neglected To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : To one who remembers your many fine editorials admonishing us of our neglected duty to support the League of Nations while there was yet time to render it an effective instrumentality for the preservation of peace , it seems strange to read in your Thanksgiving Day " leader " that " there is no shame on our conscience . " Not only have we left undone this paramount duty ? we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this great nation to that means of settling international disputes peaceably . Instead , we have preferred to sit in the seat of the scornful and condemn Europeans for their perpetual squabbling . In the Far East we have steadily supplied Japan with the means . of aggression without which , according to competent authorities , her ruthless invasion of China must have failed . It is true that we have tardily lifted the embargo that was preventing us from supplying arms and munitions to struggling democracies . But our action came too late to save the heroic Spanish demon . racy from going under . And yet is there no shame on our conscience ? Is it possible that our con. science lacks sensitivity ? E. F. CLAFLIINT . New York , Nov. 26 , 1939 . Civil War Story Recalled To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Apropos Finland versus Russia , I am reminded of the following story which Major Bright used to tell of the Civil War . The men of a certain company were forbidden to forage , though their rations were meager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odor of a savory mutton stew . Calling the lieutenant in charge the Captain demanded : " Do n't I smell mutton cooking ? " " Yes , sir , " was the reply . " The order against foraging was clear . Did you receive it ? " " Yes , sir . " " What have you to say for yourself ? " " Only this , sir . No sheep can bite me and live . " E. 0 . T. New York , Nov. 29 , 1939 . Lessons From the Apocrypha To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE TIMES : Thank you for the editorial in appreciation of Dean Gates . May I correct a slight inadvertency ? The statement that " he kept a copy of his complete Bible on the lectern in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , as it is kept at hand for use in Westminster Abbey , " seems to imply that this is exceptional . As a matter of fact , the Prayer Book lectionary requires the reading of lessons from the Apocrypha on many occasions throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apocrypha may be found in any church where these lessons are used .
