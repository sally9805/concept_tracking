SO RED THE ROSEPresently Valette followed the children in from the gallery and joined Mrs. Ruffin on the sofa . " This spring when I was at Montrose  --  " In her strong , hard voice Miss Mary began to tell what pains Hugh McGehee took , whenever he acquired new slaves , to buy their children or husbands or wives , if possible . He would send sometimes all the way back to Virginia , so that families would not be separated . " But he had to laugh himself about Nettie . They bought her from Virginia for a seamstress , and when they found she had left a husband on a ncigbhor 's place , there in Green County , Brother Hugh wrote and offered to buy him . But the offer was declined by the *Iarkcy himself , and , bless my soul , come to find out Nettie had been writin ' back about the terrible ocean she 'd had to cross on the way down to Mississippi !

" You are sitting on the porch conversing , when  --  " Miss Mary stopped short , looking about the room to see who it was that had such a cold . Plainly nobody , and with a generalglare at the four children , she went on . " It 's Marse Hugh , I 'm got a fever . ' Who 's there ? ' Hit 's Jim , Marse Hugh . Ed 's stuck a nail in he foot .

They held on to themselves , exchanging glances as if thereSO RED THE ROSE 41were better yet to come . Miss Mary stood up and faced them , her hand planted on the chair back . " Well , what a fool bird ! " she almost shouted . At that the parrot gave a great belch . Malcolm Bedford , trying to address some remark or other to Miss Mary and seeing her look past him , was convulsed with laughter , the children joining in , delighted and shriekingall together . In the excitement the parrot began bobbing up and down on her feet , batting her eyes and this time producingdelightedly a loud series of belches . Mrs. Bedford glanced up with an air of stern inquiry at Valette , who only rose and , coming to stand behind the chair , laid her arm around the fragile shoulders , taking pains not to look at anybody for fear she should lose her composure .

On that basis , he reflected , nevertheless , the belch would be a good place to stop . A very good place to stop . " Better ring for Celle to take Polly out , " he said to Mary Hartwell . But the little girl begged to carry the parrot herself , who as soon as she was taken up began to call for Mrs. Shaw . The three smaller children shot down from their chairs and crowded up close , as they went through the door and outside , the parrot screaming as loud as possible : " Mrs. Shawl Mrs. Shaw ! Mrs. Shaw ! " Sallie Bedford 's eyes were twinkling . " You 'll have to excuse the rascals . Maybe when Dock brings the mail , there 'll be a letter from Mrs. Shaw , who knows ?

Not that I 'm speakin ' of myself . " " Miss Mary , honey , what that bird eats you could put on your thumb nail . " " That 's just it . Who wants to carry parrot food around on his thumb nail ? " The parrot , however , had spoiled a plan that , in spite of his wife 's remonstrances , Malcolm had thought of trying . There was a little mulatto boy on the place named Lester , who had taken an infatuation for Captain Ruffin , and by hanging about the windows listening to the Captain 's talk , had masteredthe same accent and delivery . Malcolm , sitting on the gallery some of these afternoons , had conceived the idea of teaching Lester to say by heart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now perfect at it . To have him in , to watch the Senator 's astonishment when the little yellow boy with his curly head should give them word for word , eloquence for eloquence  --  he could hear that , " A thousand nays , rather shall we perish from the earth  --  " But not after the parrot , and not with Captain Ruffin on his way now to Jackson where they were planning a convention to consider secession . As against the North the majority was united . But they were divided between those who thought secession should await the joint co-operation of a number of slave states and those who were for immediate secession . CaptainRuffin was among the second , following Senator L. Q. C. Lamar , the leader . Nevertheless , to give up Lester 's speech seemed to Malcolm a pity . If war came , he himself would be among the first to go  --  but a man can laugh  --  . SO RED THE ROSE 43 IX . THEY had an Indian at Portobello employed to hunt .

His name , or at least a portion of it , was Ophio , but he was called Dock . He was not the stale Indian of the tales , but a Choctaw who had stayed behind with the Bedford family when his tribe was robbed and sent West by the United States Government . By that time the Choctaws were no longer nomadic but had settled down with land and possessions . Dock rarely spoke at all , but once when out hunting he had told Malcolm Bedford  --  Malcolm had never forgotten it  --  of seeing his people , when they departed , touching the twigs , the leaves , the tree trunks about their homes , saying good-bye to them forever . On most mornings it was Dock who rode into town for the post ; and that day at Portobello when he stood at the door of the library , his eyes on the floor , Mrs. Bedford , from where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers and letters to her . There were , also , a packet of garden seeds , a book , and a small box with red seals on it .

" Those are for you , Darlin ' , barring the seeds , " she said , as Valette put the newspapers into Malcolm 's hands and came back to stand beside her chair . Malcolm read The National Intelligencer . He used to maintainhis subscription by sending thirty dollars at a time . And now , when Valette handed him this issue , he ripped off the journal 's wrapper with his index finger , and handed over anotherpaper to Captain Ruffin , who opened it with a **26;2813;TOOLONG that lay on the table. 44 SO RED THE ROSE " But it 's The New York World , " Captain Ruffin said , " sent to me marked by somebody .

When Mr. Daniel Webster wrote Mr. Biddle , the banker , suggesting that his check had not arrived , it could have been assumed that his fiery orations in the Senate halls for certain interests were , though none the less sincere , less closely connected with himself than the speeches of Mr. Calhoun were to himself , who argued for his own possessionsand prejudices , which were also those of the people he represented . If the ground was not higher it was at least his . The planter voted for himself , as it were , voiced in Washingtonhis cause , his home , and the society in which both materially and passionately he belonged . It happened thus that such a man as Captain Ruffin , who might otherwise have been a mere windbag or politician in the Senate , and at this moment in the drawing-room that morning at Portobello might have been a mere florid ranter , was suddenly caught up into something larger than his own self . His voice , naturally flexible and rich , now darkened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no one in the room who did not feel the persuasion of what , apart from right or wrong , wise or foolish , is deep within a man 's nature . His wife looked at Captain Ruffin with adoration . And thus , too , it happened that in this woman , also , short waisted , homely , with small eyes and thick red hair , something beautifulappeared in her stead . " The South , my country , " she thought , smiling with her lovely smile . " My dear lover , how wonderful he is , my husband ! " She had put her hand up to her mouth , as if to say , " Do n't speak . As for me I shall not even breathe . And you , do n't speak !

Sallie Bedford almost at the first , out of politeness , had left off trying to read the letter that had come for her , though she could let her eyes rest on the daguerreotype . Presently she forgot the picture . What she saw in place of it was her son  --  Duncan  --  Captain Ruffin was speaking of war  --  her eyes no longer saw the face in the daguerreotype  --  they were merely looking . " All this hue and cry about the sinfulness of Secession spells nonsense , " Malcolm said . " William Lloyd Garrison called for Secession of the Northern States if Texas entered the Union as a slave State , back yonder in 1836 . " " But , Darlin ' , are you sure of the date ?

" She 's all eyes , she 's all blushes , this little rose of ours ! " Valette , who had stood with her eyes on the picture all this time , moved away from Mrs. Bedford 's shoulder and then , without looking up or speaking , went out of the room . Mrs. Ruffin watched her . " Miss Sallie , " she said , " that child seems sad to me . " " Who ? " Mrs. Bedford said , drily . " Valette , Miss Sallie . " " Did she ? " " I expect she misses having kin of her own . I mean her not gettin ' mail like the rest of you all this morning . " " We are her family .

" " Let 's see it , " said Mary Cherry , reaching up for the little black case before Malcolm had had time to open it . She leaned back in her armchair to look at the picture , turning it so that her good eye caught the light . " Yes , that 's right . That 's Duncan . Yes , sirree . " She did not return it but sat looking at the face in the picture , as she went on . " And , furthermore , what I 'd say is , Julia Valette 's lost her heart to him , and that 's why .

" Darlin ' , show our guests Duncan 's picture . " " With pleasure . You 'd know what a horseman he is by the way he sits by that table , eh ?

He wore a silk waistcoat , double-breasted ; the points of his necktie , with the large knot in its bow , extendedat each side beyond the velvet collar of his coat . The linen collar opened at the front stiffly , above the bow . His hair was parted far to the right and was left full at the back of his head and neck .

Mrs. Ruffin put her short plump arm around her waist and Sallie pressed her own elbow gently against it . " You have n't seen our son !

The story was well known but generally considered rather broad ; and Mary Cherry was a captain , which was , as Mrs. Bedford half knew , something of her own reputation in the county .

He was riding Fancy , whose grandmother had been the Arabian intended as a gift to General Winfield Scott when he visited his Woodville cousins on his way north from the Mexican War . George 's grandmother had been Nancy Scott from the Virginia Portobello , near Williamsburg . George 's father , Edward McGehee , was a man of great character and reflection , his mother was a college president 's ( laughter , and the library at Bowling Green ran past nine thousandvolumes .

Valette and he had last seen each other in the starlight of the gallery at Montrose  --  she had thought of it since and had not been pleased with herself for the way she had allowed him to gaze into her eyes and had laughed as if some special happiness existed between them two alone out of the whole wide world . About this she had said nothing last night to Miss Mary Cherry ; and now on his visit to Portobello the plain prose of a mere room made it easier to be natural and sensible . " Do you remember the time , George , " Valette said , " we were at your papa 's lodge at the camp meeting and they burnt pine knot fires in front of the door ? " " They got us up at five o'clock , " he said . For reasons of their own they laughed at everything remembered , and more than an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least more interesting than silence to George , and for Valette more comfortable than his making sheep 's eyes at her . She wished now with all her heart that she had frowned a little when he looked at her in the starlight at Montrose . Presently , after a silence , when the recollections seemed to have run out , George said that last week a letter had come from Micajah McGehee in California . This was George 's half brother , who had been away twelve years . Immediately Valette got up from her chair and , bringing her hands to . gether as if to applaud , stood looking down eagerly to hear . " Cousin Micajah ! " He was not her cousin , but there was no reason why , as it were , he should not have been , what withSO RED THE ROSE 53Montrose and Bowling Green and all .

I thought what beautiful curly brown hair , what white skin ! I love him , I love him ! ' I remember it exactly . Oh , how I love him ! ' I said to myself . " She did not know that this was worse than looking into his eyes for George , who stood up suddenly and then sat down , with a bump , on the sofa . " Is it really so that he was in love with the girl his brother loved and that 's why Cousin Micajah did n't come home at all after the university but just went away ? " " And joined Fremont 's expedition , and Brother Francis won the young lady . " " Will he ever come back ? " Valette sighed . " Cage ? " he asked . " Do n't call him that .

" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father heard he was sick he sent Brother Francis out to California to bring him back , but he came home without Micajah . " " Have n't you ever felt , " Valette said , sitting down again and looking past George , " that there are certain people you 'd like to ask things ? I always think I could say to somebody like Cousin Micajah , Cousin Micajah , you just gave up what you desired in your heart and kept away , have you found there 's a sort of peace , as if you dreamed it ? Or are we wasted , just thrown away ? ' " She blushed , as she added quickly , " I do n't know . But that 's the way it seems to me . " George felt himself less gay and happy than he had been. 54 SO RED THE ROSEGirls should be lighter than ' that , like flowers , like birds , exactly ; their emotions should be like a song in a bird 's throat . He could only change the subject . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd like mighty well to see . " " How empty his handsome eyes arc ! " Valette thought , collecting herself and reaching up her hand to feel if the little comb of silver and cameos was in place . " Who ? " " Old Duncan . " A second time she blushed . " Oh , Duncan . " She was angry at his saying Old Duncan like that . When she spoke of the daguerreotype Duncan had sent from Virginia , George wanted to sec it . But she said that would have to be another time , the daguerreotype was on My Dumplin 's table upstairs , in her room . How was Duncan ? He was very well . " I mean , do you mind if I ask you , Valette , " said George , " if there was any sort of promise before Duncan left for college ? " " No , of course not , what is there to promise ? There 's the guitar , but do n't carry it off , " she said gaily . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevalier la Tour was teaching her ; and George , who could play anything he touched , followed . He knew the song , after Jenny Lind 's concert half of New Orleans hummed it ; but at first they were not together . Then it went better , and that flutter of sweet sound like wings that was a part of her voice came into her singing . George could not be blamed for taking to himself some of this feeling . It was only the voice itself , which seemed compelled to listen to its own heart to find its way . They were apart again , he had struck the wrong chords , and stopped playing ; and Valette suddenly , taking a high note as if flying into a tree , burst out laughing . But George McGehee , instead of laughing , put down theSO RED THE ROSE 55guitar and buried his face in his hands . So it had got to that . She wished George had not come and that he would let her alone . Then she leaned down and kissed his sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock at the door and to have Celie come in with a silver tray on which was Malcolm 's watch , the lid open . His father before him had used this way of reminding young men that it was half past ten o'clock and time to say adieu . For George as well as Valette Malcolm 's watch was a relief . " I 'll do it if it wakes up the dead , " Valette said to herself twenty minutes later , as she stood in her nightgown before her dressing-table . She left the door open into the hall and went back to blow out her candle . XIMRS . BEDFORD had blown out the candle half an hour before , but she and Malcolm lay awake talking of the state of things . The problem of the moment was Miss Gilbert , the children 's governess . She had been with them a year . Her cousin , Mrs. Burruss , mistress of Elleray , at Woodville , had been the cause of Miss Gilbert 's coming South ; their two families lived side by side in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from governess to wife ; her sensible and sincere feelings and deep piety had made her beloved . With Miss Gilbert , though she was her cousin 's age , not yet thirty , it was different . She had an aggravated sense of responsibility that dulled her , as if some final judiciality had been assigned her for life and had lodged in her insides . She might well have married a planter husband . Many a governess came down to this country from the North and did so ; but the look around her nose had56 SO RED THE ROSE SO RED THE ROSE 57 frozen the rising compliment on the lips of various gentle- men . " If it were n't so grim , she 'd have a pretty face , " Mrs. Bed- ford said . " Well , no , " said Malcolm , " what I maintain about her face is how could anything be so strong and amount to so little ? " " No , Darlin ' . She 's prettier than that , though she does look as if she 'd swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust her entirely . And love her , except the darkies . They do n't . ' A year ago Malcolm had written in the most approved elegance to Miss Gilbert , offering her the position of governess and , in a second letter , extending to her the most cordial welcome to Portobello ; and Mrs. Bedford herself had driven down to fetch her from the boat . She saw this newcomer looking at the maroon velvet of the carriage seats , the harness of the horses , and , as they passed one house after another , at Monmouth and D'Evereux back among their trees ; and saw the pleasure in her eyes when Silas jumped down to open the gate and there came into full view the live-oak avenue , with the statues alongside , the house shining white at the end . But it was only later that Malcolm and Sallie Bedford learned that this pleasure was a good deal pure surprise . They showed Miss Gilbert through the garden , but since she had never seen so formal a garden before she had merely asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ground floor of the house , and she exclaimed at the library , between nine and ten thousand books , many of which , Malcolm explained , with his off-hand air , had belonged to his father , and some to his great-grandfather on his mother 's side , who had been a Randolph , Thomas Jefferson 's grand- father also . Miss Gilbert had said nothing to that , for she had thought little about Thomas Jefferson ; Jonathan Edwards was her hero in the past , and in the present Mr. Emerson and Mr. Whittier . It was only later that they realized at Portobello and at Montrose that Miss Gilbert 's father , a Unitarian preacher , had a collection of pioneer Americana , and that she had expected to find in this river country some wild and uncouth society of people , squatters and pirates for the general mass , and for her own employers , slave-holding rich renegades , as it were . Then why did she ever agree to come ? Malcolm wondered : to earn a salary and to save souls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations and silences , that after her frontier reading in her father 's collection , Miss Gilbert had two ideas of love among the pioneers . First , that there was only brutal sex , women as instruments , or bearing children , wife after wife worn out and buriedhowabhorrent to refined instincts , how antagonistic to the idea of woman 's equality with man , the equal suffrage that Miss Harriet Martineau and others were preaching ! Second , that the hard lean life of the pioneer had a mistrust of the love between men and women ; regarding it as a sin ; and this Miss Gilbert 's Puritan-conscience muddle caused her to feel that she understood . These two attitudes in combination made no sense ; but there was no machinery in Portobello society to discuss them with , and so on this subject it merely ended in silence with Malcolm Bedford saying privately to his wife , " Miss Gilbert resents being treated as a lady , do n't she ? " " She 'd be insulted if she were not , " said Mrs. Bedford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court gazette where every day she 'd state what she wanted a lady to be , the discussionof delicate matters to follow accordingly .

" " So you thought we had come in our wagons , rude sons of toil , and hewn our simple cots from the sturdy oak , " said Hugh . Miss Gilbert laughed and looked at the Meissen teacup in her hand , with the gold flowers . She had a natural eye for good things . " Now this old house , " he said , " was first Spanish , nearly a hundred years ago , and some of the timbers in the basement are out of a ship , clearly . So we are only rough customers .

" " Perhaps , " Malcolm said , " the ship was drawn by oxenSO RED THE ROSE 59across the prairies of the ocean main  --  bipedum currus equum  --  bullocks of the deep . " Miss Gilbert , who would have been inhuman not to have liked these people who all liked her , burst into one of her fits of laughter that she could not control . " And at D'Evereux , " Agnes McGehee said , laughing too , " the china was all done by M. Honore of Paris in a green to match the color on the walls . And just shipped here direct to the redskins .

" And thus , " Malcolm said , " there was nothing to do if Doctor Nutt kept on travelling abroad but to order marbles and other matters right and left in Europe . So much for the river pirates and land pirates in these parts . " " Just the same , " Miss Gilbert said , " I saw some odd characterson that boat coming down .

" The truth was , as they all saw , Miss Gilbert liked it and would have missed being teased about her expectations before coming to this country . When it came to Miss Whipple , the little seamstress from Iowa , the case was different . Her ideas and expectations had been like Miss Gilbert 's . But Hugh McGehee had given what6o SO RED THE ROSE amounted to orders at Montrose that Miss Whipple was not to be plagued with arguments . It was a different case from Miss Gilbert 's because Miss Whipple slid not have any sense . Nevertheless , now that it had conic , in the year 186o , what with jarring sections and parties , to an issue between points of view , Miss Gilbert had reverted to type : blood , after all , is thicker than water . For some weeks now her letters from home , the newspapers they sent , full of anti-slavery editorials , and the discussions everywhere to be heard , had perplexed her till she grew pale and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedford , in her sort of hard , straight humanity of feeling , thought less of the issue and more of this unhappy young woman ; but Malcolm grew tired of the notion of a whole house on the watch lest a young woman 's feelings be hurt . One morning after breakfast , reading a letter from her father , Miss Gilbert had turned to the others and quoted from it the lines : Dearer the blast round our mountains which raves Than the sweet summer zephyr that breathes over Slaves : " This was what the conversation was about . Both Malcolm and his wife had decided that Miss Gilbert had best take the cars back home , though as yet neither had said so , as they lay talking in the bed that was part of a set long ago intended as a present to Henry Clay , but for some reason when he was not elected president never presented . " We must admit  --  " Mrs. Bedford said , on her pillows with only a light coverlid , and her arms outside . She paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side , one arm under his head and his bare , right foot sticking out from the covers at the foot of the bed , as it did summer and winter . " Admit what , my treasure ? " " In some ways Miss Gilbert is not a fool . " " That 's beyond peradventure , " he said . He passed to the other , his real grievance against the children 's governess : " But the thing I ca n't tolerate is that fetid idealism . " It is well known that , thanks to Thomas Jefferson , its founder , the University of Virginia was established in its scientific and social studies long before such Northern colleges as Harvard or Yale , where the theological tradition held on . The influence of French skepticism , humanism , and science had worked in the Virginia university from the start . This was what Malcolm Bedford meant as he went on : " If I have n't kept up as I ought to , it 's no sign I did n't get a little light from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I read Condorcet , and I read Adam Smith 's Wealth of Nations , much as I may n't recollect it now . " " Of course . And Lucretius ; on the tariff . " " Progress .

" " You get to talking about that and you 'll never go to sleep . You know how ' t is . So hush . " " But that 's a horse of another color from Miss Gilbert 's notion . " " I agree with you . " " Well , then agree with me that I could stand my children being taught transcendentalism , witch burning , even abolition , but I 'm damned if I 'll have ' em taught that all things work together to make life sugar-coated .

" Presently she heard him turn abruptly over and lie on his back. 62 SO RED THE ROSE " Sallie , why does she want to say stun when she means stone ? " His wife chuckled , but made no answer . In the stillness she heard the flutter of the ruffled curtains in the light gulf breeze , and the birds here and there in the trees outside . " Never quite silent , never still out there , " she thought , listening . She loved all the natural life of the world ; little pigs snouting each other at the bran trough or the sound she was listening to now  --  it was the constant source of her tolerance with men and children . Valette in her nightgown and slippers came along the hall as softly as she could . The new moon had set , but there was enough light from the clear stars of the autumn sky to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains poured into the soft darkness , where the vague square of the bed was , with its black tester and posts , the shadow of the bed steps crouching beside it . She could smell My I ) Umplin 's orris , which was the only perfume she used and which would be in every drawer , faint like early violets . Valette paused to take a long , noiseless breath and to step out of her slippers . " You wo n't find it there , " Mrs. Bedford 's voice said , from the dim white of the bed . " My Dumplin'l " Valette burst into a smothered giggle . " I took him off that table , and put him over here . I wanted to look at him too . Why are n't you in bed , I 'd like to know ?

" " I 'd get sick to death of climbing these steps to bed . " " This bed belonged to  --  " " I know . Thomas Jefferson 's Aunt Kate . If she 'd just fallen out of it once  --  " Malcolm on his side of the bed kept still and said nothing . These conferences with his wife in the dark room were not new . Some of Duncan 's chief crises had been settled thus , with Duncan stamping up and down the middle of the carpet ; even Middleton had stolen out and come here about some of his secrets one night when Aunt Sophie , his nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mrs. Bedford , pretending to whisper . " Why do n't we like Mr. George McGehee , pray ? Because you do n't admire those side curls ? " " My Dumplin ' , " Valette said , reproachfully . " You know they 're not side curls . " " They 're brushed over the finger , then , like Napoleon the Third 's .

" Malcolm burst out laughing , " And it 's not even full moon , " he said , " and no serenade . So you see . So now hush .

This was the way , too , she taught them astronomy ; so that all of them went about not only on the ground but under the sky 's vaulted dome , with its morning , its evening , its golden fires . And the fine names there among the stars and constellations , Aldcboran , ( h ion , The Big Dipper , the Pleiades , Mars , red in the cast , with Cassiopeia 's Chair near the horizon , were not too different from the garden leaves or the camellias .

The child , it turned out , all winter long had stolen from her bed to light one of the sisters ' fire in the morning , had tended Our Lady 's altar , and had announced that some day she would take the veil . She had not taken the veil and her father had taken them out of the convent , but when she left Alabama and came with her sister to Natchez , Rosa was already a Catholic . On Sundays she drove in to early mass at St. Mary 's , and with her went old Matilda , sitting up in a starched white dress , a black tignon on her head , beside the driver . Tildy had belonged to the Bedfords since she was fifteen , but she had been born not far from Natchitoches , on the plantation of the Cloutiers . Her full name was Matilda . Marie Josephine de Renne , and she had never forgotten her religion . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefathers , they might easily have been hostile . In fact , there were , during Rosa 's first months in Natchez , a few of the old jibes about doing what you like and being forgiven by the priest , and so on , mostly banter , until Hugh McGehee , however little it may have been anybody'sbusiness at Montrose , had put his foot down , and in his own way settled the business once and for all . The fact was , , both he and his brother Edward at Woodville admired Rosa . more than they did her sister . Sallie Bedford had a certain harshness or finality hard for the McGehee men to understand . At Portobello it was her sister who set the note for Rosa's68 SO RED THE ROSE SO RED THE ROSE 69treatment . Sometimes when Sallie Bedford looked at that face , delicately aquiline , the skin so white , the eyes blue , and its strange look of original youth , her own eyes filled with tears .

Tell him while Rosie plays her golden harp he 'll be roasting in hell . For that matter she plays the guitar now . " Except when she was with the children , Miss Rosa did not talk a great deal , though she never seemed out of the company and nobody ever felt embarrassed by her silence . But she could play the guitar any evening , on the gallery , or in the gardenor by the fire in the parlor , as if she were a girl of sixteen . She had learned the guitar from a Spanish teacher , half in love with her . " Only you must n't ask me to sing now , " she said .

However , if Rosa war n't so quiet , I reckon she 'd sin a little with the unruly member sometimes . I 'll never forget the time she said of a certain clan , How unfortunate ' t would be to be a McGehee if you did n't like one ! ' " Toward sundown on the day Duncan 's picture had arrived , Valette stood at her Aunt Rosa 's door upstairs , about to knock . Then she ran on light feet down the hall to the windowon the avenue , her steps soundless on the thick carpet . Itwould be better to walk in the garden . She had taken a rose from a vase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She drew it out now and balanced it on the knob , so that when the door was opened from the inside , it would fall at Miss Rosa 's feet . One does this because one is sixteen and in love . At the south end of the porch the children were sitting with Mammy Tildy . Mary Hartwell sprang off the bench , ran to Valette and threw her arms around her neck for a kiss . " Oh , you 've got on your blue dress . Stay with us just a minute , Lette . Listen ! " The three children were sitting with Mammy , who was listening as solemnly as they to the sound of Miss Mary 's voice coming from the wing upstairs . Wherever she visited , it was Mary Cherry 's custom to sit in her room and sing hymns . She would put her rocking-chair in the middle of the room and sing at the top of her voice . Sometimes you could hear it all over the house . Middleton caught hold of Valette 's hand and hugged it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this time Lette 's got to walk in the garden . " " Why don ' Miss Mary  --  ? " " Which do n't ! You ai n't no nigger chile . Does n't , " Mammy said , looking severely at the little boy . " Does n't . Lette , why does n't Miss Mary be like you or Auntie ? She sings like one of Duncan 's horses . " " No , no , " Valette said , laughing and hugging him . " Miss Mary has a nice sweet voice . " " Is it like the lark ? " Frances asked . " It 's not like the lark but it 's a nice sweet voice all the same . What do you think , this morning Duncan sent his picture ! He looks very handsome , he has a big tie . " " Duncan 's got a big tie , " Middleton said to the other children , who doubled up with laughter about nothing at all .

" Listen at Miss Mary . She sho ' ain ' bust her goozle yit . " " Will Miss Mary bust her goozle ? " Frances asked , her eyes troubled . " No , Sweetness , " Valette said . " She 's been singing with it a long time . Here , give Lette a kiss . That 's Bear Me Away on the Wings of a Dove , she 's singing . That 's the hymn Cousin Abner up at Panola wrote us about . One clay in church the choir and congregation had begun singing The Bread of Life when Miss Mary jumped up and began Bear Me Away on the Wings of a Dove as loud as she could , till she drowned them out , and the organist found the place and the choir changed their hymn . She did n't like the selection . " The children did not laugh at this , but listened solemnly , as if considering how one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning his head against the full bosom of her white apron , " tell us about the sweet potato . " Valette had a way of ordering the servants about like a young tyrant , and the negroes at Portobello adored her . When she walked down to the quarters sometimes and sat with Aunt Lucy , Silas ' mother , or in her own maid Liddy 's cabin , you might have thought a young goddess had stepped out of the sky . Mammy Tildy was one exception ; she was always respectful but grave with Valette , who had flirted with Marse Duncan , who was right to file that engagement ring off his hand . Everybody knew the story about the potato . When Duncan was a little fellow his Mammy was always catching him and hugging him . One clay he went to the kitchen when they were baking and asked for a hot potato . He stood on the porch waiting with his hands behind him , and this time when Mammy threw her arms around him he slashed out with the hot potato and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not going to tell that story now with Miss Valette there . " Go on , " she said , " y'all talkin ' about things I disremember . " " I can tell y'all one thing , " Frances said , " jes let any boy mash potato on my neck , I 'd scratch his eyes out . " " Oh , you ain ' scratchin ' nothin ' out . Keep still . " Frances had climbed into the old woman 's lap . " If Marse Duncan done sumpn ' like ' at , he ain ' meant nothiu ' . Anyhow , I forgit , back yonder . Hit 's time for y'all to go on to Aunt Sophie anyhow . Hey , stop standin ' on your knees in my lap , rumplin ' me to death . All right , if you keep still . " The little girl , resting against Mammy 's shoulder , leaned off to admire the red tignon on the round old head . With one finger she touched lightly the tignon , wishing she could wear one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " said Middleton . " An ' cast a wishful eye . ' " ' To Canaan 's fair and happy land , Where my possessions lie . ' Sing it to us , Mammy , " the little boy went on . This was the verse Mammy Tildy sang to boil eggs by , three times for soft boiled , five for hard . But she now said only , " I ca n't sing nothin ' today , de Lawd ain ' wid me . " " Where is he ? " asked Frances . " Whar who ? " " De Lawd , " said Frances . " Well , then , talk some the way you did when you were little , " Middleton said , and Frances patted the fat shoulder : " Say that about the two birds . " " What 's the matter wid y'all ? Los dos ozos . " The children tried to repeat the Cajun French to each other , again doubling up with laughter . It was a good moment for Valette to slip away . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues parallel to it on each side of the avenue , ran a walk carpeted with moss . The blue lattice pavilion seemed solitary and the72 SO RED THE ROSEboxwalks triste , and she felt happy , as if she herself were the good angel that walked with her . She went slowly on young feet over the green path . The high corridor of boughs above the driveway was denser and closer in the yellow dusk of the fading light , and from these trees the hanging moss was now blurred into a mist . She heard the sound of fowls going to roost . The yard behind the stables quieted ; in the hedges the small noises fluttered for a moment . As she paused half way to the gate and would have turned back , she saw suddenlyone of the statues where the sky through some gap in the trees touched it . Lifted on the pedestal the nymph stood , holding up with her white arm , her wrist curving lightly , a wreath . Valette raised her arm as the arm was in the nymph 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so lightly held , and felt as if the flowers of the wreath rained clown from her own finger tips . " Why not ? " she said to herself . XIII " Loox , come to my room , " Mary Cherry said , taking Valette by the arm that night . On the way up from the companydownstairs the sharp old eyes had found her standing alone by the hall window . " Now what 's the matter ? " She closed the door behind them and , taking a ring of keys from her skirt pocket was unlockingthe wardrobe . " Today you were all smiles , but I watched you at supper . You ate about as much as a sparrow . Here , eat some of these . " She held the black box from the wardrobe open for Valette . " Go on , I made ' em myself . Do you want to starve to death ?

My name 's Mary Cherry . I saw you . " Valette laughed outright , and took hold of the finger Miss Mary was shaking at her , heavy like an old man 's finger . Nobody else at Portobello would have been so free . The old woman drew the girl 's head against her shoulder for a brief moment ; it was like leaning against some granite monument . " Because Duncan did n't write us , eh ? " She pushed Valette away from her as if to indicate that the court would now come to order . " Eh ? " she repeated . " He has n't written since he left  --  it 's two months . " Tears came into the soft eyes . " Which only shows he loves you . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue the point about men , but went and stood by the window looking out . " Why n't he write you , tell me ? What struck him ? " " He thinks I 'm fickle . " " Why do you carry on and stir him up ? " " In my heart I never think of anybody but Duncan , it 's Duncan . " " That 's just it . You ought to give him something to worry about . " Valette 's lips were trembling , but she made no reply to Mary Cherry , who sat down and began to rock : " He 's quite a dandy in that daguerreotype , with all that finery . As splendid an eye as ever I see in a mortal head . I 'd just forget him . When I was a young gal there war n't a man could n't say I 'd not forgotten him , and those I remembered74 SO RED THE ROSEI wished I 'd forgot . Draw up a chair and sit by me , or on the trunk if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks put in the middle of her room and left there , they were leather carriage trunks and not very large . In one of these , the larger , were her clothes . In the other she always carried a little hearth broom , a shovel and tongs , her favorite cake pan , her hymn book , and a certain familiar article sometimes fancifully known as a vessel of dishonor , because , she said , it fit better . Valette sat down on the smaller trunk , and Mary Cherry quit rocking and leaned over kindly to take the fluttering little hands in her own . She was going on to sixty years old : she had whiskers on her chin which she sometimes made the children of the family pluck for her , sometimes giving them a cake and sometimes not ; she had never fallen in love ; and yet leaning over and looking into the girl 's eyes , so rashly bright and wild and tender , she felt hutnhle and curiously happy in her soul . When she heard Valette saying that you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and heard at the same moment through the open windows the leaves on the trees outside stir like a whispering , she felt as if the sweet voice close to her ear was out there too , the beating of some gentle heart that said , " The strong belong to the weak , through love . " " It 's a question if you ai n't wrong , child , " she said , patting Valette 's hand awkwardly with the hard bones of her fingers . " I 'm positive you are . Duncan got some of that wild Tate blood , his ma 's brothers were tearing all over North Alabama . But he 's a fine boy , and he will be yours , as they say . You watch and see . " She wanted to say something more of comfortbut felt she was not very good at it . " Look here , " she said so suddenly that Valette looked up , startled for an instant at the rough tone , " nobody , I mean out of church ever saw Mary Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sirree . " SO RED THE ROSE 75She threw herself on her knees , the great old frame looking high-shouldered and full of huge angles , and resting her elbows on the lid of the trunk in which travelled her absurd collection of articles , the hearth broom , shovel and tongs , the cake pan , hymn book , and chamber pot , and closing her eyes , she prayed : " May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable to Thee , 0 , Lord , my strength and my redeemer . Hallelujah , Amen . " She rose clumsily and without looking at her young friend , walked over to the table for the box . " Here , sit where you are . Eatin ' will do you good . " Valette choked down several of the cakes , the tears streamingdown her cheeks unnoticed . " Do n't you know tears are salty ? " Miss Mary said . " With my cakes , what sort of a mess is that ? " She began a low chuckling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh , brushing away the tears and the crumbs from her cheeks as she rose to go . " You precious Miss Mary !

If I had a child with measles I 'd put the others in bed with it .

" And I go farther , " she went on , turning to Hugh McGehee , after some of the company had expressed a difference of opinion , and begun a livelier conversation of their own on other subjects . " I quite agree with your notion , Mr. McGehee , that children and young people . should not be spared the sorrows and deaths and crises that come to families . After all , these are high lights , children grow by them , and I feel sure of it . " " So I think , " he said , " exactly . " She reached out her hand lightly to touch Edward 's . " I have n't forgotten what your father said to me when my husband died . That a sacred memory is the most valuable thing one may have , to live by through the years .

" He turned to Valette on the piano stool , " and Valette thinks so too , fifty times more . " Mrs. Bedford said to Valette , " You need n't be leaning over here and your eyes growing bigger and bigger like the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood ; this is all meat and drink to you . Do n't I remember when you came home from Montrose and cried your eyes out over Fanny Lintot and Philip Nolan they 'd been telling you about .

" Valette turned to Malcolm , who had been refilling the cups , and emptying more than one , as he motioned Edward to do the honors of the house . " It 's beyond me the modus operandi of this controversy . Sing nightingale , " said Malcolm .

' " " So she did , and I thought , all right , go ahead and be as merry as you want , I love to see you merry , and see what you get . Her idea of Christmas morning was family prayers and a pair of mitts you 'd knitted for father . My father gave me a horse and a Spanish saddle and an English rifle , and by sunrise had proposed so much syllabub he did n't know which was which . Nevertheless , today was Christmas morning . And Christmas Gift ! " He meant that his wife and he had spent a long time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women dresses ; he gave the men felt hats and shoes and coffee and flour . There was a four days ' holiday . The slaves went into town to buy gifts for their children , and in the evening would dance and have suppers . Valette sang the Echo Song which , difficult as it was , MadameJenny Lind , in her New Orleans concerts , had made a favorite among the young lady singers in those parts . " Well , " said Mrs. Quitman speaking out in her downright fashion when the music ended , " you did get through it , my dear . I heard Jenny Lind sing it , General Quitman and I , nine years ago in New Orleans , when Mr. D'Arcy the hatter paid $245 for his seat , which we certainly did not , I can tell you .

" SO RED THE ROSE 79The old lady sighed at the thought of times past , and Valettesighed , smiling and so pleased at the compliment that she repeated the song , pushing the puffed sleeves farther down her white shoulders and singing the flowery parts more carefully . Afterwards she ran over and whispered in Mrs. Quitman'sear , who nodded her head and gave her young friend a little push toward the door . Then the old lady , taking the last cup of syllabub from Edward , motioned him to follow Valette . " Sing something Southern , " Malcolm said . " That la-di-da 's all very delectable , but  --  " Then , not seeing her , he asked , " Where 's Valette ? Where 's Ed ? " " Gone to Charleston , " said Mrs. Quitman .

" She gave a sigh , her gaze resting on the moonlit scene beyond the window. 8o SO RED THE ROSE I SO RED THE ROSE 8rIn the bright moonlight Edward and Valette drove the fast horses , seeing the leaves and shadows , the magical fields of silver , the moon ahead of them , high in the sky , though the night was not yet far advanced . He drove as naturally as the horses themselves took their gait . " We 'll pretend the places are shrines , " Valette said , laughing . " Are you thinking of romance , romance , nothing but ro-mance ? " " No , " she said , thinking of the lovely tannic Lintot , of the Spanish woman 's solitary grave on the edge of the Devil 's Punch Bowl  --  a hundred years ago was that ?  --  of the chapel at Windy Hill Manor , and of Duncan if he went off to the war . " No , I was wishing I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hear Jenny Lind ? " " So as to phrase better , Edward McGehee .

" I ca n't see how it could ever he better , " Edward said , quietly and in the same tone of sincerity that his father often used . It made Valette feel that her singing had meant more to him than to herself , the singer . " Now I hear his heart , " she thought . " There 's nobody like Edward . You 'd think the girls in Natchez  --  " She smiled at him that happy reckless smile that My Dumplin ' had so often warned her about , lifting her young face so that her eyes were in their own shadow , and he could see the moon flash on her white teeth . " Duncan has n't heard you sing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew for whom she was so filled with sadness and delight . " No , but  --  " She let it go at that . The last letter was folded down in her bosom . " Before we know it , " she said , " Duncan 'll be going off and enlisting . " " I expect so , if war comes now . " " It will . " " How do you know , Valette ? " " I know it , " she said , throwing out both her small hands to the soft , near , shining night with its shades and its smell of the warm , moist fields . " I know it by all this . By all this now . I just know it . " They drove in silence past Concord where Mrs. Minor , wife of Don Estevan , Spain 's governor , had lived . Natchez had known her as the Yellow Duchess because in her house the gold mirrors , the brass fireplace , the brocade of the curtains and furniture had been in that color , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and buff and drawn by clay-bank horses . Edward knew all there was to know at Concord from the stories told at Montrose , and Valette had heard often the Concord story . On the Concord walls hung the portrait of Don Estevan himself , in blue and crimson velvet and satin and gold braid . " Is the back of this seat too straight for you ? " Edward asked presently . Valette did not answer . In her mind was the picture of Frances Lintot , waiting for Philip Nolan , and then walking up and down in the garden of her sister 's house , after the news that he had been shot . " Mrs. Quitman will want the trap or we could go to Laurel Hill , " Edward said . " You know the Mercer Chapel . " The chapel had been built for a wife and three children who had died suddenly in the yellow fever , and later the builder , who loved them , had asked in his will to be buried under the chancel .

" But their way home led easily past Clermont and the Devil 's Punch Bowl . From the cliffs surrounding it they could see down on the treetops below . Legend said it had been sunk by a failing meteor , that river pirates had buried their treasure there , and outlaw gangs made it their retreat . Everybody knew that , farther down nearer the stream , men dying on their river courses were buried ; and had heard the superstition that the river , rising in flood at times , came to claim them again , washing them out of their graves . But here , high on the edge of that wooded hollow of the Devil 's Punch Bowl , was the tomb of the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Valette and Edward left the trap to go and stand there , in the moonlight that shone over the ruined spot . " Edward , tell me . What do you feel when you are at a place like this ? I want to know about you men . " " What do women think ? " Neither had answered the other 's question . Edward tightenedthe reins as the horses struck out clown the road that would bring them back to Portobello . She said to herself , " I could ask Edward questions I 'd never dare ask Duncan , even though I do live in the same house with Duncan . And why ? " The answer was that she was in love with Duncan . So that was what love was like ! And that was why the moon tonight made you want to cry . She was trying to remember some poetry about the tears of things , and leaned her shoulder against Edward 's . " Once we started a fox along here , " Edward said . " I know , Mr. McGehee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons in the country , " she replied , in a tone that made him defend himself . " Hold your horses , now , there 's a poem to the moon , chaste and fair , that says queen and huntress . " " It 's just men poets . " " I 'm sorry . And here 's the gate , it seems only two seconds . " " Do you know  --  " Valette broke into happy laughter , " Look ! " The trap had stopped inside while he closed the gate ; and she pointed to where the moonlight fell through the live-oaks and the faint moss , down on the statues , gleamingand broken with shadow , and on the broad ground of the avenue . At the very end hung the cloudy white of the house . " Is n't it really  --  ? It 's more beautiful here than any of them ! " Valette said . " Anywhere we 've been . " She saw him standing there , and thought , " And how beautifulEdward is ! " When he sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reins with a lovely gesture , as if she were giving a flower . Her mind was filled with the sweetness of life . She looked at the statues , her eyes half closed . " Do you know , Edward , if I too were a marble goddess , I could go on forever . " " Yes  --  then . Forever , " he said , in his young , rich voice , and so low that she scarcely heard the words . The horses broke into a trot , quickening the flashes of the moon on the harness . XVIT was two weeks since Edward had returned to the academy . His sister Lucinda McGehee had been away in Kentucky at the Worthington Female Seminary , where her two sisters had been graduated before her . But , with the uncertain times and84 SO RED THE ROSELucinda 's own annoyance at the indecision of Kentucky people in choosing between North and South , her father by the second week in January had thought it well enough to have her back at Montrose . " Has Buddie come yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining as she kissed him . She had been the first off the boat . His father hoped to keep Edward at the academy as long as possible , judging it , in such a state of things , a steadier place for a young man of eighteen to be in . In his letters home Edward wrote of the weekly exercises in reading and oratory devised by Colonel William Tecumseh Sherman , their superintendent , and that the students selected pieces by Yancey , Calhoun , and other Southern orators , all praising the defense of their slaves and home institutions as the patriot 's highest duty . A year before , Captain Rickett 's company at the Baton Rouge arsenal had been ordered to Texas , and the Governor of Louisiana had remonstrated with the Secretary of War at Washington for leaving unguarded so many arms in a country where the slave population was five or six to one white . Major Hoskin 's company of forty men had been sent to take over the arsenal . On January 8 , 1861 , a convention was to meet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Louisiana secession had hem passed by the convention , telegrams came from her senators at Washington and Governor Moore ordered all the United States forts seized , along with the arsenal at Baton Rouge . The night of January 9 Colonel Wheat , with the New Orleans militia , came up and took the arsenal , allowing Major i loskins to embark for St. Louis . The big store of arms was sent to various places , a large quantity put in Colonel Sherman 's charge at the academy . Edward 's father read his letter aloud with the family , several of the servants standing by the door to listen . Colonel Sherman was a Union man , he considered secession treason , war . He had been ordered to receive goods stolenSO RED THE ROSE 85from the United States . He had sent his resignation to GovernorMoore . How , in a state of affairs like that , Edward wrote , could any cadet keep his mind on studies ? " Wo n't you write , Father , and give me leave to come home ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh McGehee said , drawing out a paper that his friend Governor Moore had sent him . He sighed and began a passage from the letter : " In the event of a severance of the relations hitherto existing between the Confederated States of this Union , I would be forced to choose the old Union . It is barely possible all the States may secede , South and North , that new combinations may result , but this process will be one of time and uncertainty , and I can not with my opinions await the subsequent development . " I have never been a politician , and therefore undervalue the excited feelings and opinions of present rulers . But I do think , if this people can not execute a form of agreement like the present , that a worse one will result . " I will keep the cadets as quiet as possible . They are nervous , but I think the interest of the State requires them here , guarding this property , and acquiring a knowledge which will be useful to your State in aftertimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment her father stopped reading . " You certainly intend to let Buddie come home , with a superintendent going on like that .

" " I think Lucinda 's right , " his wife repeated , as she rose and went over to stand beside his chair and laid her hand on the frowning brow . " We had the academy report yesterday , " Hugh said . " As you saw , it was merely our boy 's rank in his studies . " 86 SO RED THE ROSE " Not the top rung of the ladder , but good enough , my stars ! I do n't see how he can study at all . " " Maybe not . Will you write today , Agnes , and give him my leave to quit ? " She went over to the mantelpiece and leaning her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . With no one speaking they seemed to hear suddenly the sounds from outside , birds there , and then Aleck iii the garden singing along , snatches to himself . Upstairs struck faintly the bell of the little silver clock with its beryl columns at the side that her brother Malcolm had given Agnes at her wedding . Presently , without looking at her husband , she asked what the day was . It was the twentieth . " He 'll he here before the end of the month . He 'll be here with us , and t hen  --  I 'm almost sorry I spoke . So that 's it . " " That 's it , " said Hugh . " You hear what your mother says , Lucy ? You 've missed your brother , I know . " Lucy , without a word , faced around and went out of the room . " Lucinda ! " he called after her . " She does n't answer me . " Agnes turned to him , " We 'll just have to understand Lucy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which she spoke was only assumed . She was gazing at the expression on his face , on which she saw now that sad , lonely quietness , asking all , asking nothing , that most made her love him . The look in his eyes at the moment expressed everything on which we can rely in this world . A week later Edward rode one afternoon into the court , dismounted from his horse , which William Veal had taken down to the docks to meet him , and ran up to his mother 's room . She had just risen from her siesta and had on a Watteauteagown of dark blue challis that he had not seen before . When his mother saw him standing at the door from her sitting-room into the hall , she said nothing , only a little crySO RED THE ROSE 87as she ran and buried her face in his shoulder . He put his cheek down on her head , his arm around her . William Veal , who had followed Edward upstairs , with the small portmanteau , turned away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to himself . XVI " BUDDIE , " Lucy asked , in a cold tone , already prepared to resent it in case there were those who lacked the spirit , " would all you cadets enlist ? I mean if it came to that . " " They say all will . " He began to tell her of the various cadets from Louisiana and Mississippi families and what one or another of them had said or done . " Noblesse oblige , " said Lucy , as if to say that to enlist was nothing , but not to enlist sheer white trash . Edward had been home more than an hour , and the talking had not stopped for a moment . Everybody talked , as only a Southern family can , talking to each other for the love of all ; whatever subjects of conversation there might be were knocked down like a feather . " I certainly would n't take any foolishness from Washing . ton . Those new towels of Mamma 's , you might as well wipe your face with a sheet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat on the bed while he washed his face and hands . " But Mamma likes this French damask and that fringe . Buddie , I thought my hair was fine enough , goodness knows , but yours is like a cloud of silk . Is that the way gentlemen of fashion in Alexandria must brush it now ? It 's like GeneralBeauregard in his pictures . " Edward was always very susceptible to Lucy 's moods , and her happiness on seeing him again shone back to her from88 SO RED THE ROSEhim . General Beauregard had visited his two sons at the military academy , he said laughing , and for weeks there were nothing but little Beauregards marching about . " Well , is n't he handsome ! " said Lucy . " I always wanted to know what men think a handsome man is . Is that where you get that stock ? Honestly , Buddie , I 'd think it would choke you to death , but you look mighty sweet . " This reminded him , Edward said , that he must go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two convalescentguests , and the sewing mistress , Miss Whipple . Mr. Munger was in the vapors , said Lucy , at the thought of Mississippiseceding . His own State of Wisconsin a year ago had threatened to secede till the United States Government put a foot down ; but this was different , the Southerners were rebels , by the living God , Mr. Munger had said , the other day when Mrs. Wilson came over from Rosalie with the present of one of the hams she took mu 11 pride in , and had declared that secession was nothing new . " Yes , " said Mr. Munger , " all men are brothers . " " No doubt of it , " Mrs. Wilson said , " brothers and sisters . " She made this reply solely because she saw , as everybody at Montrose had seen , that Mr. Munger had been a preacher and would go on repeating things long after it is obvious they will never he clear to any one . Lucy searched a fresh linen handkerchief out of the portmanteauand handed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sober up , and then all will be left is the sweet memory of a welcome from Miss Whipple . She has another bundle of tracts from Massachusetts , so she 's calling us Mack Gee flee again , and stuck a pin in me yesterday when we were fitting my blue silk Papa brought up from New Orleans and two brooches to go with it for my birthday , after Mamma and he 'd already given me this necklace . " She tipped her chin up for him to see theSO RED THE ROSE 89necklace of amethysts , like little bunches of grapes capped with gold leaves . " Mamma says not , but I saw Mamma laughing , and do n't tell me about that pin , ' t was when I said no , Miss Whipple , McGehee rhymes with McFee . She said , which McFee ? hold still . " When Edward came downstairs the ladies were absent at their toilettes , and he and his father went out to look at the new camellias , which were blossoming this year for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation in West Feliciana . Then they walked for half an hour up and down a path , where hedges of clipped althea divided the quince orchard from the garden . " You and Uncle Edward at Woodville are antislavery men , are n't you , Papa ? " Edward said , " and so was Uncle John up in Panola . " He knew what anxiety his father had always felt about the mistreatment of the negroes belonging to him . " There were plenty of antislavery men in this country till the northeast part of Mississippi was opened up , and later on the industrial North began to grow solid against us . " When Hugh began to explain to his son the convictions that moved him , Edward himself replied with such point that his father was delighted . He was surprised also , as the older generation always is at the younger when it shows thought , and even accuracy , in a sober field and an argument close to preference and life . Evidently these young men at the militaryacademy had not been devoted only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman had mentioned ; they had made a check on history . Hugh McGeheecould see the cadets , as Edward talked , informing and correcting one another in the historical facts . He listened , as parents do , with astonishment but with pride to his son saying things that people were accustomed to think of as better known to his elders . Who did not know , Edward said , that in the Revolution it90 SO RED THE ROSEwas the South that had led in the fight for freedom , and freedom , therefore , was beyond all price ? It might be that one Union would be more profitable , economically , but what of that ? If the State 's being sovereign would make it hard for any secession government of these States to organize into one central power , well , what of that ? In a country that might take over territory or another , and plan at any moment to annex Cuba or Haiti or Mexico , imagine talking of the Union ! But if union is so holy why plot to break up union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union , and , presto , some holy unity has come upon it ! And then to talk of a State seceding as if some crime were about to happen that had never been heard of before ! The sound of laughter and quarrelling , then an accordion , all together , came through the orchard trees from the quarters . Hugh , glancing up , saw his son smiling at him , and silence fell between them . His father understood . The young hear what the old say ; it seems to he reason and to be exact cause , but it is not the point . In Edward , his son , though he had not got it expressed for himself , the movement toward war represented something larger . The sounds at the quarters stopped , it was supper time there and all would be indoors , except for a boy 's voice , high and clear , which went on singing for a little , then left off ; and Hugh McGehee , who had paused to hear it , for he loved all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be walking with his son and listening to him in the double light of an old affection and the new state of affairs that would be taking him away . As Edward spoke of the plantation and some of the old negroes he had always known , and then of the journeys when he was a little boy with his father to the plantation in Parish Ascension , and the festival of the sugar cane , when they tied a ribbon on the stalk to be the last cut before the shoutingSO RED THE ROSE 91and rum began , he felt a sense of going back to his own , and said to himself that this soil , on the soft , brief herbage of which his feet now moved , would last forever . These feelings , though he did not see his way to develop them into ideas , he knew were stirring in him and that they could carry him , through some sort of action , farther than he had ever been into himself . He was one of those blest natures , based on health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differentbut finer in the qualities of the average man . Paralee 's little grandson , Swamp , came out on to the gallery with the supper bell and rang it twice as long for Mr. Edward'shaving come home ; and at the supper table , loaded down with the white Roman hyacinths , spoonbread , and brandied peaches , the afternoon conversation went on as if it had never been interrupted . Miss Whipple , who , however thin , was a hearty eater , kept her eyes first on her plate , then on Edward , then on Lucy , as if wondering at this conversationlike a cage of birds . " Lucy , my child , " her mother said , " drink your milk , at least . You 'll be worse than Cousin Lizzie Boone . " " If I may ask , Mrs. Mack Gee Hee , " said Miss Whipple , " who is Mistress Lizzie Boone ? " " Oh , she 's our cousin Lizzie Boone , in De Soto County . " " I said to myself I would n't go far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And , Miss Whipple , ever since the day I was born , " said Lucy , " I 've had Cud'n Lizzie Boone thrown up to me , now have n't I , Mamma ? " " The thinner Cousin Lizzie gets the less she eats . " " Cud'n Betty Bullock when we were there always said Cud'n Lizzie was n't like that at all , she was a pantry nib-bler . " " Which is all moonshine , " said her father , laughing , " lock , stock , and barrel . " 92 SO RED THE ROSE " There , you see how ' t is , nobody in this family will ever let you say Cud'n Lizzie ever took a bite to eat in her life . Miss Whipple , you see ?

It was a successfultransition and they got on well enough . He always planned the breakfast for Sunday morning , and before sitting down went out to the kitchen to inspect it . They were as generous as they were rich . " If little Ed 's for Mr. Jefferson Davis he must not have seen his Uncle Edward lately , " Miles said . " Eh , son ? " " It amounts to the same thing , Uncle Miles , I 've seen Father , " Edward said , smiling at the creaks of his uncle 's chair , a huge hickory rocker  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timbers  --  in the midst of the French horsehair and brocade of the room .

" " Nothing 's well known in these God-forsaken days , my dear Puss , " said Miles . " And I reckon the McGehees being friends of Zack Taylor 's did n't help . He hated Davis . " There was a pine fire on the hearth , but the long windows were open , and already by the end of this first week in Februarythe air was like spring . The strong fragrance of the9394 SO RED THE ROSE sweet-olive filled the room , confused at times with the peach trees blossoming .

They had four other plantations but lived here . " I know that we have always , " Edward said , without any thought , and speaking as if from a clan , " been on the side of a Constitutional Union Party : destroy abolitionism in the North , destroy disunionism in , he South . " " Less than a year ago Mr. Davis was opposing Secession , said he thought slavery and property were better under na- tional government . Well , now , by God , he do n't think so , " Miles said , " oh , no , not by a jug full , do n't thuk so at all ! " " Both parties have gone to extremes , have n't they , Uncle Miles . " " Aye , aye . And much water 's flowed under the bridge since Buchanan , saying his prayers every fort y seconds , was Presi- dent . And now this same Mr. Davis who last year was likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as likely to be elected President of the Confederate States of America by the Congress of Delegates at Montgomery . And should he be , in my humble opinion it 's no go . " " You know it 's remarkable how much strength a delicate man can have if you stir him up , " said one of the guests . He was the doctor from St. Joseph 's , a neighbor of the Davis brothers . " Anybody with a modicum of sense , " said Mrs. McGehee , " knows Jeff Davis is ambitious . Ambitious and a politician . And a military man . That V formation of his in the Mexican War , whatever they did with a V formation it was the most celebrated V in the world 's alphabet . Jeff Davis and General Zachary Taylor returned from the war , and had the ovation in Natchez , crowned by Miss Julia Montgomery , the fair , chosen by the citizens as their voice .

" And everybody knows , " she went on , " the Davises are plain people . Jeff Davis is handsomely educated , of course , he 's cultivated himself . And Mrs. Davis , honey , goes up like a dome .

Joseph Davis lived on the next plantation to the north of them ; and Brierfield , the thousand acres he had given to his brother , was nearby . Joseph Davis , by profession a lawyer , had become , also , a rich planter , with theories of agricultureand slave management . She turned to her nephew , whom she admired and loved . " But they just do n't inherit what you 've got , my dear , that 's it .

Her husband was absorbed with what he was saying about Mr. Davis as the orator of the South , and the crowd in Washington to hear his farewell speech . " The voice , the voice , " he said , wrinkling up his eyes and laughing , for some reason . " Your Uncle Miles , " his aunt said to Edward , " got himself96 SO RED THE ROSEsent to the State Legislature once  --  at Jackson . Did n't you , Mr. McGehee ? " " To fight the bond measure . Then I resigned . " " He made a speech calling Senator Duval so many dreadful names that he jumped up and took a shot at your Uncle Miles , who was just saved by his bowie knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said he coolly . Why , Duval , you 've dented the handle of my knife . ' So the whole Jackson , Mississippi , legislatureapplauded . " Miles McGehee looked annoyed and the chair squeaked loudly . " What sort of fool wants to he in politics ? " Nevertheless , for all this familiar criticism of Mr. Davis , Edward , when he got to his room , found his mind full of him . For a long time he lay awake in the wide Empire bed . At first the image of his uncle with his 400 pounds or more alternated with the tall , slender , military figure he rememberedat Brierfield three years before , the large blue-gray eyes , the fine brow , the voice that people and newspapers were always comparing one way or another to music . Then there remained only the one image , of Jefferson Davis . At Brierfield , after the death of his young wife , president Taylor 's daughter , Mr. Davis had been a recluse for eight years , talking with his brother , reading , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had married Miss Howell , one of the Howells at the Briars , neighbors of Mont rose , and returned to be a leader in Washington . And now with the secession of his State he was no longer a leader in the Senate , and had come home again . And so Edward lay thinking , and before he fell asleep had decided to ride over next morning to Brierfield and call . Mr. Davis , stopping to leave a pruning knife on the post , came through the gate to meet Edward . " So you 've come again to see us , how long is it ? " he said , bowing formally and taking Edward 's hand in his own , whichSO RED THE ROSE 97was fine and slender but strong . His face was full of pleasure at seeing this young man whom he remembered as a boy of fifteen . Edward after the first greetings had pointed to Black Solo , and thanked Mr. Davis again for such a gift . " This is a pacing country , Mr. Davis , " he said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people I 've got the best pacer of all . " Horses were in the Davis blood . They stood there talking . Edward could not quite remembermoment by moment what Mr. Davis had just said , standing there with his hand resting on the saddle , but the old magnetism which he remembered three years ago came back . This whole visit was to move in the glamor of that memory of a boy walking about Brierfield with one of the greatest orators of the day . He could remember his father saying , " I know , Mr. Jeff Davis can talk about Homer , loggerheadturtles , Roman law , Italian poets , astronomy , the American Revolution , but  --  " To Edward the beautiful face , that of a dreamer , scholar , and soldier strangely mingled , looked tired and older . Mr. Davis put an arm through his , and talking of first one thing and then another , led him along the garden . His tone seemed to say that there must be nothing near to him that his young friend should not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted that others agreed with him . The Gloire de France , the finest of all tea roses , had provided cuttings for the circular rosebed . The other roses needed pruning . He was proud of the system at Brierfield , which , though there were only thirty-six negroes instead of the usual hundreds , had a special code , and a jury system among the negroes themselves , the pardoning power residing with the master . Then suddenly he began to speak of a State like South Carolina withdrawing from the Union . Which was one thing . " But , " he said , " if there should be an attempt to coerce her98 SO RED THE ROSE back into the Union , that act of usurpation , folly , and wicked- ness would enlist every Southern man for her defense . " The fine clear eyes turned now and again to his young visitor , the long slender hands made now and then a gesture . Mr. Davis was talking to him now as he had talked before to a boy , with that same openness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in feeling but not in mind ; and thus he had a ready approach to the young , because with them he had the sense of not being misjudged . Edward 's father had read to him from some journal a sen- tence that said Mr. Jefferson Davis had the power to stir rather than to win men 's hearts . I lk eyes rested on the finely cut lips , which now and t hen were compressed into the old and austere line that he had heard Mr. Davis ' critics speak of . But most of the time the expression of these lips seemed to him only delicate and nlnhile , the music of the voice had not changed . Overhead now and then the white herons from the swamps and lagoons along the river to the north came flying against the cloudless sky . The soft morning warmth filled the air with violets , sweet-olive , and scents from the orchard . Upon the secession of Mississippi , Jefferson Davis , Mexican hero , former Secretary of War , linked States Senator , had been appointed by Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of war , which was generally thought certain , it was known that I ) avis would like to head the South- ern armies . As he was asking Edward about the sentiment among the cadets at the seminary and the seizure of the arsenal at Baton Rouge , they reached the gallery , where Mrs. Davis came from indoors to join them . " Pray allow me to present , " her husband began , but she also remembered Edward and began to inquire of his family at Montrose . She was younger than her husband . To Edward , who at this period of life must judge women by his mother , the poise that she had taught herself seemed rather something pompous . But when he saw the passionate attraction and pride that came into the dark eyes as she looked at her husband , he forgot this impression of cold self-confidence . In the library , crowded on all its walls to the ceiling with books , a servant brought a decanter of Madeira ; and Mr. Davis repeated his questions about the cadets and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exactly . He never considered what he was going to say , and so you always believed it sincere , which it was . On their way to the gate , where Black Solo was standing with his ears up , waiting , Mr. Davis spoke of Edward 's uncle at Woodville . " Judge McGehee , " he said , in his fine , quick rhythm of speech which made Edward feel as if he were stepping to music , " I trust he is well . When I think of him I am always reminded of Madame de Maintenon 's remark anent sincerity , you will remember : sincerity , she said , does not consist in saying a great deal but in saying all . Only a few words are necessary to open the heart , if you are sincere . " The tone , as Mr. Davis said this , was half like an orator 's , perhaps ; but Edward heard only the enchantment of the idea and the words as they were spoken . Two days later they heard at River Orchards that yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Congress of Delegates meeting at Montgomery . It was the 9th of February . Alexander S. Stephens had been elected Vice-President and a constitution had been formulated . The delegates of the seven States thus far seceded had pushed forward in order to establish definitely the Confederacybefore the day of Mr. Lincoln 's inauguration on the 4th of March . It was a morning like spring and he and Mrs. Davis had been making rose cuttings from the Gloire de France that grew near the gate when a messenger rode up onzoo SO RED THE ROSEhorseback with a telegram . Mr. Davis had opened it , read and re-read the message , then told Mrs. Davis . The messenger later had described to people how the President looked at the message a long time , with a grave , sad face . While they were discussing the news at his Uncle Miles ' house , Edward , for some reason he himself could not have explained , decided that he would leave next morning for home . XVIII " Civn , war has only horror for mc , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped up to the very last that it would be averted . But should any attempt be made to coerce the seceding States to return to the Union , that act of usurpation , folly , and wickedness would enlist every true Southern man for her defense . Edward as he rode along heard in his thoughts Mr. Davis ' words . He had lingered at his uncle 's house for a while listening to the discussion of the new President of the Confederate States . Three or four neighbors had come to dine , and what would have been at other times gossip and hunting talk now buzzed around the political situation . On devotion to the State there had been no disagreement . Every one there shared Mr. Davis ' conception of Mississippi as a commonwealth , a whole in itself , free under the Constitution to withdraw from the Union of States when she saw fit . But about Jefferson Davis as the man best suited for the Presidency of the seceded States no two persons in the company thought the same thing . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their own hands ? SO RED THE ROSE zoa " Mr. Davis is a military politician , " some one said , " he is not an administrator . " " T'hat Jeff Davis is a scholar we all know , and you know it , Miles , " Mrs. McGehee said , and spoke of Mr. Davis ' Latin and Greek , his reading in Spanish literature and in the Italian poets , and French . " Five languages , besides his own , ought to be enough for anybody , not to mention those Indian dialects he 's conversant with , which seems a waste of time the way they grunt what they mean anyhow . And I myself have heard him quote poetry by the yard . Melodies and lyrics , in that angel voice . And science he knows , all that about fishes and geologies . " " You see that , gentlemen ? " said Miles . " My wife 's the kind of lady if she drowned would float upstream ! " " I heard Jeff Davis speaking once . He brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law seemed melodious like music . But thinker , no , " the lawyer said , " not sufficiently dispassionate . But when he gets his tooth into an idea he wo n't let go . I suppose that gives a sort of philosophy . " " I think it does , " said Miles , " it 's a philosophy of character at least . " " Take his education , however , " continued the lawyer , " nevertheless , notwithstanding , it 's not Southern . I 've known Mr. Joe Davis these many years , as his lawyer and as his friend . I recall when he sent his beloved brother Jefferson off to Kentucky . Born in Kentucky , then moved to this country , then sent off again to school . Six years a scholar in one college or another , his teachers not Southerners but English , then Scotch , New England , French and Irish . Catholic , Presbyterian , Unitarian , Deist , Socian influences . I will say one thing : his contact with the Catholic Church for a time must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training about as little Southern as possible and West Point removed him still further from Southern influences . Mr. Davis may repre-102 SO RED THE ROSEsent but he was not born to the Southern system that your family represents , Mr. McGehee . A great orator he is , yes , that 's another matter . " " Is he ! He can charm a bird off a bough , " said Mrs. McGehee . " And he 's a kind enough man and it 's delightful to be in his company . Eddie was there yesterday . He 's positively in love with Mr. Davis . " Some of the guests turned to look at the young man standing by the armoire . Edward made no answer ; he kept his eyes on the carpet , and could feel his face and his lip twisting with anger . Miles McGehee pushed himself up out of his chair and turned toward his nephew , chuckling . " No matter , son , keep your hero , do n't let us  --  " " It 's a fine lot anybody here knows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrogant tone surprised even himself . " Miles ! Miles ! " he heard his aunt say ; his Uncle Miles was cursing angrily in the huge family voice . " I apologize , " Edward said , bringing his heels together in the style learned at the military academy , and with a stiff bow . " I beg your pardon , sir . Au revoir , sir . " " Now , Miles ! What 'd I tell you ? " he could hear his aunt saying as he went out . " I never get a McGehee red in the face . Tell me not , sweet , I am unkind  --  to wars and arms I fly  --  " her voice followed him on his way to the gallery , as if she were reciting , and when the words were lost he could still hear her bright laughter . While the servant , a short , lively boy named Lige , was tying Edward 's saddle bags on the horse , his Uncle Miles came out , the fat , proud , kind face troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Yas , suh , yas , suh . Seems laic today Mr. Ed cusses ev'ything he teches . " SO RED THE ROSE 103Miles McGehee looked tenderly at his nephew , and said he was sorry , in such times as these nothing bitter must come into families . " Why do n't you wait till in the morning ? It 'll be after sundown before you get there . But I know you 'll cut right out once you 've started . So come and see us . So good-bye . " Edward kissed his uncle and sprang into the saddle . From the gate he saw Miles McGehee going toward the house , walkingslowly and every now and then stopping to gaze out across his fields . The road followed the river , the expanse of which sometimeswas visible . Sometimes there was only the glint through the trees and the hanging moss . He rode along half seeing the river , or the road ahead , or the green of the fields , and with nothing at all of the scene at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled with the glamour and magnetismand conversation of the man whose voice and words came back to him . If his mind was filled with this man , his heart was resting on his father , who was in Edward 's feeling the background of all true things . On all sides everybody was talking the questions of the day : and all these things his father said or knew : his father heard all the arguments , and remained alone ; and felt something about life and about the future , comprehended it , as it were , under God . And Edward saw how this was different from most men 's chatter . Mr. Davis may have been chosen over better men for President of the Confederated States : it may have been the politics of the delegates ; the States might have seceded in too much haste ; Mr. Lincoln might , as he promised in his inaugural address , not interfere with slavery . So people talked , and so men argued . Mr. Davis remained . This Southern country that Edward loved remained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was one of those people who follow something inner , some com-104 SO RED THE ROSEpulsion like a cloud ; something in him was like the balancings of the clouds . In the young soul there is a certain universal element by which causes and events are simplified and weighed so that they take a form that is like what , eventually , time will give them . The report of events that later history gives is often only what they were to the youth who were in the midst of them . And so at this moment Edward could not but have believed that his feeling was right about these things . If he had consciously thought in those terms he would have seen himself as the prophecy of what would some day be the story of this Southern cause . The striking of his horse 's hoofs on the ground seemed all at once to him louder , and lSelwaod saw that dusk was coming on . The first stars were out in the cast , the fields and pastures were fading . As he passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes after the day , he was filled with egotism , and he thought how low and sordid the world was , compared to what he was feeling . At the edge of the town he could feel I ; lark Solo step out into a pace , and leaned down and patted his shoulder . At the same moment he decided that he would not joist a cavalry regiment ; not cavalry , some humility beyond the dash and show and cavalcadeseemed to fill his young spirit . As he turned into the Montrose road , he seemed to be turning into the gate at 1iri ; rficlel three years ago , on that firstvisit to Mr. Jefferson Davis . A boy of fifteen , and the tall man with the fine brow and eyes , courteous and deferential , as if you were not a mere boy , talking in that voice like music and in such words as nobody else ever used , about the horses , the soil , what planets belonged to the month ; walking along with him in the garden paths , past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the melon patch , quoting the Latin poetry  --  Edward had found it afterward and learnedSO RED THE ROSE zo5it by heart  --  about the whitening melons on their sea-green leaves At Montrose , William Veal came to open the stable gate . Edward learned that his father when he heard that Jefferson Davis had been elected had walked the floor all night . XIX " TELL me , Buddie , " Lucinda said , as they sat in the hammockat the end of the south gallery one morning in the languid ten o'clock hour , " do you think talking brings you closer to people or just keeps them farther off ? " " I only wish now at the seminary we 'd been able to talkfrom the way it looks nobody there will be meeting again . " " But why do you say you wo n't see the cadets again ? " " You know as well as I do . War . " " Do you remember the time at the Easter party General Quitman scented himself all out ? He roared about the MexicanWar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crying for . " " I remember he had taken you up in his arms and you had long curls , and climbed down to the carpet , " Edward said , giving the hammock a swing with his foot against the floor . " That was because I knew that what he was talking about was his big self . " " Then Mamma whispered to you to go take the general 's hand , he was the most popular hero in the United States ; but you would n't . So you came and sat by me on the corner sofa . You said he smelled like cake . " " He kept vanilla beans in his armoire to scent his linen , but we did n't know that . I sat by you and felt very sadzo6 SO RED THE ROSEbecause I thought a hero could eat up all the cake if he wanted to . " " If we 'd always done the way Mamma wanted us to we 'd have been angels by now . " " Buddie , do you think Father 's dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stopped the hammock with his loot . " Plague take it , what do you mean , simple ? " " Plague take it yourself , Mr. Edward McGehee , I am alwayswondering why he wo n't just pack off these old psalm singers out of the house . " What she referred to was the way they had at Montrose of giving shelter e , ' ery winter to two or three invalids from the North , recommended to Hugh McGehee by some minister or other in the church . Two rooms in the south wing were reserved for this charitable practice . The two now were Mr. Munger from Wisconsin and Mr. Triplet from Providence . Lucy went on : " Father 'd let Mr. Munger bring his medicine bottles to the table if Mamma had n't put her foot down and yet look at the sense Papa 's got , what he says about people like Mr. Munger 's ancestors ! " " What does he say ? " " Says it 's not so much that these people are not well-born , they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like it , " Edward said , laughing . " It 's not that you 're trying to descend from Alfred the Great , Papa says , what you want is to be connected with something larger than yourself . But it 's no use telling Mr. Munger . If you 're Mr. Munger , you want to be self-made . " " Certainly . Then you 're the first to get there . " " ' T would be rude with a bang , " said Lucy , " to tell Mr. Munger just where he 's got . You know , Buddie , Papa 's certainlygot sense sometimes . " " I thought you said he was dull . " SO RED THE ROSE 107 " I said sometimes . I think he 'd be smart , though , if he 'd wring Miss Whipple 's neck . That 's what your sister 'd do . " " You sound like Aunt Sallie , " he said , smiling . " Well , let me sound like Aunt Sallie . I remember one day over there she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean letting those Yankee divines sit around Montrose with their sharp noses ? ' " " Yes , and what does Aunt Sallie do ? She 'd sit up all night with a crippled goslin . " " That 's different . You should have heard them yestiddy , I mean our two theologues and Miss Whipple . " Lucinda told of the conversation of the three Northerners about slavery and secession . God would punish every man , woman , and child in the South , they said . Except that Miss Whipple did not think darkies should be slaves ; she thought they ought to be all taken out and shot . You ask for a glass of water , Miss Whipple said , you may get it in a quarter of an hour and you may never get it at all . " What I wish is , " Lucy continued , " I could bray the way I used to . You remember the time Miss Whipple told Papa on me because I asked her why she did n't say Mc Gee Hee Haw ? Haw hee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , though I like our old donkey Pike better , I like her more than I do the theologues . " Lucy 's voice suddenly changed , as he put her hand through his arm . " Edward , are you really going to enlist ? " He turned and looked into her eyes quietly , then kissed her brow . " I know you are right . I know you are right , because you are good , " she said , as if to her own thoughts . Presently , as they talked , Lucy began to complain of how everybody talked of secession and the war to suit themselves , but her mother interrupted by coming to say there were guests who wanted her to sing . Judge and Mrs. Winchester and Colonel Harrod were in the parlor. io8 SO RED THE ROSE " Mamma , I 'd rather not , " Lucy said , frowning . " You know I ought to stop trying to sing until Monsieur la Tour has taught me a little at least . " " Colonel Harrod 's just been praising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sots acteurs  --  " Lucy said , turning to Edward . " Monsieur la Tour says for stupid actors God made stupid spectators . " " I know it 's considered a most elegant tendency to run into the French , but my child had better give up French if it 's goingto make her so tart , " her mother said , stroking the brown head . " Mamma , you know it 's not French , it 's that old Colonel Harrod . If he 'd just hush up ! " " Sh ! Your voice carries . I 'm sorry , but I did n't propose it , honey . " " I know , I 'm sorry , " Lucinda said , rising , but not touching her mother as they moved toward the long window that would take them through the library to the parlor . " I 'll try gladly . I do n't know what 's come over me lately , Mamma . Sometimes I think I 'm the sort will live on and on till they have to put out poison for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the well . Judge Winchester has an ear for music . " When Edward heard Lucy singing a few moments later he understood that he could see deeper into her nature than his mother could . As he heard now the low , rich voice moving through the song , he leaned his head on his hands and sat motionless , listening , solitary and eager . Both his father and mother loved Lucy and admired her ; but they would sometimes look at her as if nothing they could do or say would make their love reach her . Lucy was too handsome a young lady not to draw Colonel Harrod 's loud applause , and Edward heard it with his youngSO RED THE ROSE 109lips curled in contempt . Colonel Harrod was a tall man of fifty with two plantations and a house then building , called Stamboul , and designed with the idea of rivalling Longwood , Doctor Haller Nutt 's house at the other end of town , thirtytwooctagonal rooms with an octagonal rotunda for the five stories . For some months the colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel of Southern manhood . At the same time he had been able to explain that he must accept the proposed terms of exemption from military service for planters with more than twenty slaves . he could , he declared , best serve the South by the raising of supplies . He was the kind that if such a law of exemption for planters were abolished , would likely turn preacher . Colonel Harrod , Edward could forget . But there were men like his father , like Judge Winchester , and thousands of others who had talked from so many sides about the war . There was so much to be considered , so many rights , leaders , policies and laws , sections , interests . As if these things were the point  --  As if there were not within youThe singing went on . His heart was restless , tragic and rebellious ; he wanted the cause he fought for to be simple and single ; he knew that it was not . He wanted his country to be perfect just as one thinks of a beloved girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war ; he had not any girl that he was in love with , and the Southern cause passed through his mind like a face that was still vague but would be beautiful yet , and a voice whose sweetness he felt but had not heard .

I gave cordial fellowship to them because they were Northern men ; some of my most cultivated correspondents were Northern men . In the developmentsof Northern politics came out purposes that startled me . I felt a rebuff and with indignation . Next came this dissolution of the Union caused by the election of Lincoln .

On a March day , late in the afternoon , a sudden pain in her heart was so intense that she fainted . The season that year was already like summer , the windows open , the garden full of hyacinths , roses , verbenas , and heliotrope , and the air fragrant with them .

" " Ai n't there anything you want ? " Rosa shook her head and paused . Then she began to speak in an odd whimsical tone . " I know I 'm dying . I 've never done anything but I 'm not jealous , I 'm not prejudiced , and I 'm well balanced . If I 'd stop talking , I 'd be restful . " Her sister chuckled , and smoothed the sheet at the foot .

" You remember back at home , Sis Sallie , they had to put the schoolhouse for the children off in the grove so we could n't hear the noise the grown-ups made at the big house ; they had such a good time .

Mamma thought her daughters were such classical young ladies . Do you know I got six Abbot 's histories as a prize for diligence . Can you imagine anything more ridiculous ? " She closed her eyes , and seemed to be asleep , still smiling at the comical notion . They went to bring the priest for the extreme unction . Valette came with the children , who knelt with her along one side of the room , looking on with curious , wide eyes as the priest went through his ministrations . Frances , her little face quivering and tense , held on to Valette 's hand , as she kept peering into her mother 's face . At that time Sallie Bedford was not religious , or only conventionally so . The deism of her father , who had somewhat pompously professed to follow the belief of certain founders of the Republic , had left its traces on her . So that now she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things nobody could know ; and instead fixed her attention on the priest 's face . The priest looked like a dull man , but he was only an instrument ; the power of the great Catholic service and the depth of the momentSO RED THE ROSE 113made every one present understand the plane and meaning of it . Some of the servants had come in and stood against the wall . With so many people there the room was crowded . Mary Hartwell stood with her arm around Middleton 's shoulder , leaning over to stroke his hair with her other hand , as if she were the little boy 's mother . When the service was over , Frances began to sob aloud and Hugh McGehee took her up in his arms and carried her into the hall . The two other children were taken over to kiss their aunt , whose eyes were still closed . Every one but Sallie Bedford then left the room . In the silence that filled the room Rosa suddenly opened her eyes and saw her sister looking at her with an expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of her sister and this love and pain , she saw what seemed to be figures in a ritual , a march , a sort of childlike glory . And at that moment it seemed to Rosa that for the first time she understood the movement in herself of her religion : In every Christian church men laid their sorrows before God . But life was not merely sorrow . The Catholic Church had a visible form to contain the abounding life , the beloved pride , the show and energy of us ; and through this form we gave ourselves to the church ; so that , also , God should possess our joy . She repeated that thought to herself : so that , also , God should possess our joy . Sallie Bedford touched her sister 's shoulder , which to the hand felt thinner even than appeared , in that thin body which she had carried like a light . " Are you in such pain , Rosa , honey ?

It was a little boy in a white suit , standing by a table with a vase of flowers . Mrs. Bedford also glanced at the picture before she replied . " Henry ? I will . I will . The very best I can . Go to sleep . " She had sent twice and had gone herself out to his room the day before , but her brother would not put his foot in the house . " I did n't get to tell Hennie good-bye . " " No , you know how he is . I think he must have gone off for a long walk . " " Sis Sallie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . " I want you to do something . I want you to kiss mc , kiss me good-bye and then go , honey . You stay there in the hall , do n't you go away . I want to die by myself . " Mrs. Bedford did not answer . The figure on the bed seemed to sink downward and to be quieter , the eyes smaller till they closed . The hands , after making some strange weaving motion , were laid at the sides . " So kiss me , " Rosa said . She kissed her , and as she went out , until the door was closed , she saw the white face with its delicate aquiline features , and the blue eyes following her . BY that time it was late morning . As Mrs. Bedford brought a chair and put it before the door of her sister 's room and took her place there , she saw how the trees outside no longer cast shadows into the hall , or varied the colors of the wreaths in the carpet . A warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as it had gone every day for more than twenty years , but the house negroes tiptoed about downstairs and talked with low voices in the kitchen . On the bench by the kitchen cistern , little darkeys had sat all morning huddled in a line close together , frightened and still . Miss Rosa had talked to them every day , when she was feeding cottage-cheese to the young turkeys , or had paid them cakes to pick up the feathers if the geese had molted on the lawn , the most cakes for the most feathers . The servants were thinking that tomorrow they would go into the parlor and see Miss Rosie in her coffin . If they were not allowed to , their feelings would be hurt . Mrs. Bedford sat there squarely before the door . Rosa had asked to be alone , and had asked her not to go away ; and that was the way it was going to be . It did not seem to her strange that her sister wished to die with no one in the room . " Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " will she go , depart , with this sense of love ? Can she take it with her ? Or is it only something warm within ? " Rosa had been open like a book in all things , even about her religion ; that was true , and yet it was not true . Something about her life with God ,  --  was it some dream of God in a life that is only a sleep ?  --  Rosie could not share . Was that a weakness ? Nobody could answer such a question ; but if it was a weakness , Rosa had a right to it ; let everybody live his own life . She heard Valette 's voice and then her brother Henry'si16 SO RED THE ROSE downstairs , but not what they were saying . Then she heard old Henry 's voice say , " What 's it to you if I go ? " and his heavy tread like a drunkard 's coming up the stair . He reached the head of the stair and stepped a foot or two forward and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be even taller as she looked at him from where she sat in the chair . His long hair was wilder than usual . " Listen to me , Bud Henry , " she said , folding her small arms across her breast . " You listen to me . Yesterday I went out there myself and begged you to come sec Piggie before she died , and you would n't do it . Swore you would n't . And now you can just stop in your tracks right where you are . " She could see the shine of perverse meanness in his dim , shrewd eyes under their wiry eyebrows . He had put his hands into the side pockets of his coat , from one of which a worn leather book stuck out , and as he spoke he assumed a sort of lazy swagger . " Eh ? " he said . " ' Then I judge I 'm de trop . " " This is no time , Henry . Rosic 's ( lying . Go on down- stairs , " she said , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in there with her ? " " Nobody , she 's by herself . She asked me to leave her by herself . " " Do n't let me intrude , I am always the last to intrude . As you know . " A blush spread over his sister 's face , but she made no reply . She unfolded her arms and clasped her hands around her knees ; and he waited until he saw her look up at him . " And you carry out her wish . You tell yourself what Rosa wants Rosa shall have , just as you let your brother stay out in a nigger cabin , because he wants to . " " Why n't you tell the truth , Henry ? You know a hundred times we 've begged you to come in and have your room up here , " she said , squinting as she spoke , in order to examine him . He was clean at least , his linen white ; Aunt Sophie had orders to see to that . " A hundred times I 've begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if I would n't o ' perished , " he said , with a smirk . " All the blather in this house ! " " Shh ! Do n't talk so loud . " She looked at the door behind her . " All right . Then listen . I 'm not fooled . This letting people have their own way , this taking care of us . Do n't you think I think it 's love . It 's just vanity  --  and it 's no more'n you 'd do for a sick dog . I know . What you feel , my darling sister , is animal pity . Animal pity . " " Oh , Henry , oh , please hush ! You 'll break Sis Piggie 's heart . " He repeated the harsh phrase that had been in his mind . " Animal pity ! That 's all ' t is , not human love . Animal pity ! " " Curse me out , but talk low , " she said . Then as she saw him glaring at her , his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , she remembered in anguish how handsomehe had been when he was a young man ; she thought of the child 's picture on the wall ; and with a gasp like a sob she buried her face in her hands . Then she heard the door to her bedroom open down the hall and raised her head to see her husband standing there . He stood just outside the door . She saw by that air of control and concentration that he was drunk . Drink whiskey to escape ! Malcolm had a book open in his hand . " What is it ? " he said , quietly , closing the book and glancing at her brother , who had turned his head away . She said nothing , inside she felt hard ; and at the same time she was surprised to see that she recognized the book , it was her own copy of La Rochefoucauld . She saw in her mind that first page , his portrait of himself ; Je suis d'une taille mediocre , libre , et bien proportionee  --  I am medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportioned  --  oh , Malcolm , trying to drown this grief in whiskey ! At the same time she heard her brother Henry 's phrase , " animal pity  --  animal pity . " " I asked what is it ? " her husband repeated , but not moving from where he stood . " This commotion up here ? " " Vanity of vanities , saith the preacher , " old Henry burst out mocking , as he saw his sister motioning his brother-in-law back into his room . " Saith the preacher ! " Malcolm listened to these words and began to grin . Then he stopped grinning and stood gazing at his wife , with eyes full of confusion and distress , as he stood wavering slightly on his feet . " Vanitas vanitatum , " old Ilcnry said , his voice rising " Hypocrites ! " Mrs. Bedford rose , but put her hand backward on the frame of the door , her arm across it . " Hush , Henry ! Your being an atheist do n't matter . Malcolm , go back to your room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go back ! " " Why died I not from the womb ? " Ilcnry mocked . " Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly ? " She made a violent gesture to Malcolm with her hand , and he turned gravely back to his room and shut the door . When the door was shut , she turned to her brother , stepping out nearer to him and away from Rosa 's room , " Hush your mouth , you crazy dog ! I 'll cut your throat . " " All right , all right , I can hiss , too . I ) id she ever tell you she used to bring me cakes ? Your cook makes ' em from Mamma 's recipe , back in the old days that was .

" Hennie , you 're in the presence of death . " She saw the look of fear that came into his eyes  --  " Then the idea of death haunts the poor wretch , " she thought . Her brother looked timidly at Rosa 's door . " That 's so , " he said , and turning on his heel walked clumsily down the stair . Sallie hesitated a moment ; and then going to the stair rail , she leaned down and in a low voice kept calling till Valette answered . " Come help me , " she said , as Valette fell on her knees beside the chair and put her arms around her . " Seems like I ca n't stand it ; it 's just the way it is , but I seem  --  I ca n't stand it . " " I wanted to come .

Of course Rosie was not really jealous , ' twar n't like her . " " Nor you , My Dumplin ' , " Valette said , but Sallie Bedford went on : " Precious child , I tell you  --  we 've begun now to have death in this house . And , I reckon you 've thought of it , too  --  we 've begun death in our country . " Valette only closed her eyes and rose to her feet , her lips quivering . Mrs. Bedford had also stood up . " Listen , now maybe you might open the door a little and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more time . " Valette , without heeding the hand that made a weak gesture120 SO RED THE ROSEof restraining her , opened Rosa 's door a few inches . She quickly drew back , closing the door again softly , and bowing her head as if to say yes . Mrs. Bedford took hold of Valette 's wrists . " Keep your hands down . Do n't cry .

He had married a Miss Mary Dabneyand brought her home to his plantation , Belle Grove , which at his father 's death had been one of the finest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelton Taliaferro had ridden far and wide , paying visits , courting , ( lancing , and playing the races . His wife was a beautiful woman who wore her beauty with an indifference that puzzled people , especially Southern people . She had two interests . Religion was one ; St. John Dabney , her grandfather , had been convertedto Methodism by John Wesley . The other interest was her husband , whom she loved with passionate worship and surrounded with a devotion that drew alternately the contempt and the reverence of the neighbors . Several years passed without children , then a son was born , and at his birth Mary Taliaferro died . Her husband , though he had neglected her , or at least not by any means devoted himself to her , when she was dead seemed all at once to be transformed . The power of love seemed to envelop him . Her memory was like the memory of a saint to him ; he became gentle , absorbed , almost abstract , and began to divide his life between going to the church meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard in Amite County that grief for his wife had been too much for him , and that he had gone daft . He knew what some of the hunting planters thought ; and he spoke serenely to them when , for the first months before they left him to his ways , they called like gentlemen and friends at Belle Grove . " It 's strange , " he told them , " how , when you 've heard them blindly all your life , all of a sudden you understand what theI2I122 SO RED THE ROSEold phrases mean  --  ' the communion of saints , ' the fellowship of the Holy Ghost ' . " When he said that , they took it to mean , since they were not very strong on saints , that a man must love his family , and that Shelton Taliaferro should marry again . After a while they stopped coming to Belle Grove . The child born was named Charles Edward de Jarnette , Charles Edward de Jarnette Taliaferro . He was brought up by his black mammy , Dorsey Bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child had no mother and because his face resembled the dead Mary ' 1'ahaferro 's , Shelton never punished him . The passionate and wilful boy did as he pleased , now defying his father , now throwing his arms wildly around his neck in a burst of tears , now sulking . It was understood that anybody at the plantation , even his mammy , who laid so much is a finer on him would have to settle with the master ; and so the boy 's natural arrogance was increased . Torn , 1 ) orsey 's son , of about the same age , was given to Jarnette , to be his playmate , to he ordered about , and later to be his valet . Shelton called his son Jarnette , a family name from Virginia - often at Belle Grove they said Jarrie  --  until at fifteen the boy himself decided that he would not have the name any lon , i er , but would be called by his first name , Charles . Meanwhile , the plantation fell into even worse neglect than it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first owner . It was mortgaged and re-mortgaged ; parts of it were sold off . Two or three times Shelton Taliaferro had written Hugh McGehee and borrowed money to pay the Belle Grove taxes . He knew he was welcome to the money , but always felt that he must give the most elaborate reasons for requesting it . In the autumn of 1859 Charles , taking along his man Tom , his guns and hounds , rode up to Oxford to the University , from which he came home in April . The following NovemSORED THE ROSE 123ber he enrolled with Edward , his cousin , at the Seminary of Learning in Alexandria ; but at the close of the first examinationsColonel William Tecumseh Sherman , the superintendent , who had no patience with young Southern gentlemen of Charles ' type , called him into his office and read to him the comment he intended to write on the report about to be sent his father ; and Charles , who thought even worse of Colonel Sherman than Sherman did of him , without a word walked out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife 's death , Shelton Taliaferro would never leave the plantation unless he was obliged . Just before Charles went off to Oxford , however , they came for a visit to Montrose , driving over in an old rockaway that had itself seen better days , but at least was drawn by two fine horses belonging to Charles . The visit was less than a week . Shelton did not like to be away from home , where some revivalist preacher or circuit rider was often staying , and where he used to read in his library sometimes till dawn , or walk about the neglected place , under the old trees and by the outhouses , with a strange , rapt movement as if speaking with God . Some of the negroes , if they awoke at such times , were afraid to look out at him . One day at Montrose , during Shelton 's visit , when they were sitting on the gallery , they saw the tall , thin figure in its black suit , walking thus . He was far down at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a small orchard of quinces . " Well , wife , " Hugh McGehee said , gazing at the figure , walking , walking , " I reckon these days Shelton 's just not all there . " " Who knows ?

So clean and pitiful , but nobody cares how he looks , not a soul cares a rap . And do it now , while he 's not in his room . " She called to a servant crossing the court below to send Aunt Aurora to her upstairs . " I know it 's just as you say , Mamma , Cousin Shelt 's got land enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just the same Aunt Aurora and I might as well take care of the poor old thing . " " I 'm not so sure he 's such a lx , or old thing , precious . His face is so sweet . " " I know how you think , Mamma , and that 's all right for angels , they 've got their wings to cover them . But I look at his waistcoat . It looks as if he buttoned it with a fork . " On Wednesday , Mrs. Quitman , with Doctor and Mrs. Martin , came to supper at Montrose , bringing along beside the driver 's box a basketful of some new water lily , shell pink with a yellow centre . Pretty soon Sallie and Malcolm Bedford with Valette arrived . During supper Malcolm Bedford was telling stories of Natchez-under-the-Hill , before the days when the town on the bluffs above was much of anything . He loved the story of James Willing , who owned a shop there , went away to join the Revolutionary armies , was promoted to captain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm , he carne back home with his soldiers and looted his old friends . " They 'd taken the oath of allegiance to the Colonies , but Captain Willing skipped that , " Malcolm laughing and winking at Lucinda , whom he liked for that look of honest pride and wit . " He made them prisoners , to row his boats on the river . Sic semper tyrannis , which was in 1778 . The sins of the whole Mississippi Basin were washed down to that Natchez of those days . " Malcolm knew stories about the pirate Lafitte 's sendingSO RED THE ROSE 125barges of stolen cattle up to be sold and was cheered on to tell them . Even Shelton Taliaferro listened with a child 's delight ; he was one of those rare people who lead intenselyreligious lives without taking much stock in weighingthe sins of others . As Malcolm spread himself , everybody therefore laughed except Mr. Munger , the older consumptive . " Nevertheless , notwithstanding , sir , our great Constitution stands like a rock , " he said to Malcolm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Malcolm said : " brethren , we are gathered together . " " Tell about Murrell perhaps , " said Agnes quickly . " Murrell , Mr. Munger , had a sort of club on the bandit order . " " Murrell 's gang , " said Malcolm , bursting out laughing at so innocently elegant a description . He began an account of the famous highwayman . Afterwards Charles rode in as far as town with them , and next day , looking the worse for wear , fell asleep in the parlor after dinner . Everybody else knew what it was ; he had done the town and ended with Natchez-under-the-Hill ; but they saw his father gaze at Charles , rosy around the eyes and nodding in company like that , as if it were only a child resting . When their cousin Shelton spoke of starting for Belle Grove , Lucy and Edward begged that Charles might stay . She was fifteen and the two boys were not much past seventeen ; and it seemed to the three of them that the visit had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they said , and William Veal , with an admiring glance at this young man who seemed to him very stylish and quality , said , nodding his round , gray head , " Gladly , sir , gladly . " But their dashing young cousin surprised them by linking his arms through theirs and walking with them toward the126 SO RED THE ROSEwindow : " No , " he said , quietly , in his engaging voice , and putting a gentle stress on the last word , " I 'll go back with him . " It was a Sunday , and they were to depart for Belle Grove early Monday morning . A chicken had been fried for their lunch basket and the rest ordered : green tomato pickle , stuffed eggs , ham , beaten biscuit , peach chips , cup cakes , and a bottle of punch . Paralee , the cook , was to keep an eye on the preparations and see that they were ready in good time . Every morning at the Montrose quarters this old woman waked the servants . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call , " Get up , you lazy niggers , the stars are down ! " That last afternoon of the visit , Charlie had been telling his cousin Edward some of his New Orleans stories , which now and then he would compare with Natchez-under-theHill ; and that night when everybody had said good-night and gone to their rooms and shut the doors , Edward lay for a long time awake in his bed by the window . The things his cousin talked about , the stories lie told , were disturbing . ' The soft air poured over him , and the leaves outside moved softly with a sound like waves . Shortly after midnight he heard , or half heard , some one at the stable-lot ; and , looking out of the window , saw Charles riding at a walk down the drive . XXIIIIr was a year and six months later , that day in May , 1861 , when Charles Taliaferro rode over to Montrose and told them that he was going away with Edward to the army . Eighteen months , plus Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 127done everything . He was now a young man , going on to twenty , tall , slender , with languid movements and muscles as strong as wire . His complexion was all white and red and black , the color strongest in his cheeks , and pink around the brown eyes , the brow white , the dark hair compact and rich . He was a perfect example of a certain Southern type , planters ' and lawyers ' sons , who knew horses , rode well , hunted  --  were fine shots , had manners , a certain code of their own , and would not have been afraid of the devil himself . lie had never taken an education , had never worked and never intended to . Life with its powers and magnetisms came to him easily , as the sun and growing came to the vegetation in that country . He read slowly and talked easily , in a low voice , persuasiveand alive . By one of the ironies of human life it was this young man who was devoted to Edward McGehee . Reckless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage at least , forever after women , oblivious and wilful , Charles gave to Edward a great , impetuous affection and complete admiration . They had been together the few months at the seminary until Colonel Sherman proved too much for Charles ' patience . And now Charles also was going to enlist under General Beauregard . He had ridden over to go with Edward to Virginia . It could have been said that his father and Edward were the only two people he loved in the world . From the parlor Charles and Edward could be heard talkingof the January state convention to consider the relations between the government of the United States and the government of the people of Mississippi , after which the commissionerswere sent to visit the other slave states . At all the Southern capitals they were received in diplomatic style , as ambassadorsfrom foreign republics . " For these three days now those boys have talked nothing but General Beauregard , " Hugh McGehee said , having justSO RED THE ROSEheard the young men comparing their hero with Napoleon . His wife and Lucinda were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a list of things to be bought in town for Edward to take along . " Ca n't be much to Charles , one war 's as good as another to him ; he 'd fight a buzz saw , I reckon . It 's all Edward , Charlie just follows him . " " It wo n't do him any harm , Edward 's example , " Agnes said , smiling . " Let 's put him in his fine-tooth comb , " she said to Lucy , who gave a shudder at the thought of what this was for " Well , " Hugh said , " Charles Edward de Jarnette Taliaferro  --  atleast he 's got all the family names , whatever credit he may do them . " " And plenty of castile soap , " her mother said to Lucy . " Yes , plenty , " Hugh said . " Cousin Cindy Eppes is a case , " he went on , picking up one of the morning 's letters from the table . It was from a fifth cousin of theirs in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation and for a while lived in Paris bringing up a son , whom she planned to make a diplomat . " What do you reckon she wanted us to think , Agnes , when she wrote this about Charlie ? " " Cud'n Cynthia will let us know in her own sweet time what she wants us to think . " " What 's it she says , Papa ? " Lucy asked . " A little disposed to be Creolized and I gave him such a lecture about balls , plays , and so forth , that I think I restrained him a great deal . " Agnes shook her head with a grin . " There 's no use talking about it , Cud'n Cynthia just thinks we 're all country saints up here . " " Yes , Cynthia 's a pious fraud , " said I lugh McGehee .

She 'd always given everything to anybody that came begging . All there was ever in her armoire was her bonnet and shawl . She had one little gold pin , an ivy leaf . She always wore it , it was buried with her . We used to visit at Belle Grove sometimes when she was living . Nobody knows where half the things in the house have gone ; they say now it 's like a hare . 1 remember at the time of the funeral I asked where the silver goblets were , but nobody cared .

" " No , I should n't think so , it 's gone , " her mother said , quietly , though she had not missed the tone in Lucy 's voice . With the same thing in mind she watched Lucy during that day and the next . " I wish we had a good miniature of Buddie , " Lucy said , avoiding her mother 's glance . Later in their bedroom , Agnes put her hands on I-lugh McGehee 's shoulders and stood looking into his eyes , her lips quivering in spite of her . " I 'm frightened for Lucy , " she said , " I 'm so frightened about her . " She knew that Lucy was the kind who would love when she loved and would not change easily .

The moon had sunk behind the trees , and in the dark room the sweet smell of roses and pinks had followed the damp wind from the garden . She got up and shut the window , and stretched herself again on the bed . That morning two letters on green paper heavily sealed with green wax had arrived for Charles . Before he came down she had looked at them to see the postmarks . The small writing was full of flourishes and shadings . Having looked once at these two letters , she took pains to look well .

George McGehee had arrived from Woodville ; in the stable his horse , after a long ride , stood sleek from the currycomb and brush . " It may not be a bad idea for Lucy to go , " Agnes said to Hugh McGehee , as they sat that morning on the gallery . " Just as well to see some other young men beside Charlie Taliaferro .

" I ca n't complain , " Mr. Munger said , in a tone that implied that nothing short of divine aid enabled him to speak . " I find you looking very well , " Agnes said . In clays like these such a long face about nothing was more than she could hear . " What we were talking about is the evening party at Arlington .

It 's this sort of man will be one of the things that will ruin this country some day .

The trap could have taken them , but Charles proposed that he and Edward ride to Arlington and that George McGehee , since he had already ridden up from Woodville the day before , should share a carriage seat with Lucinda . It seemed all a simple plan to Edward , who thought nothing of it also when Charles Taliaferro , after the horses were brought round , went back upstairs for his gloves , so that they were well behind the others in starting . For a while Charles was silent ; then speaking rapidly at first , as if he were shy , and then as if arguing or defending himself , he took a letter out of his coat , held it up in the dusk , and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew he was going to the war and this was the third letter of hers that Charles had received at Montrose . This lettersaid that she would be in Natchez that night , at a tavern in the lower town . He took out the letter again , but could not see to read the tavern 's name . " You mean she 's a quadroon ? " Edward asked , when Charles had said that this woman was under the protection of an old man ; her mother had settled her at sixteen with an old French hanker . " Yes , " Charles said , the reckless quality coming into his voice . " I saw her at a Quadroon Ball , at the Orleans Theatre , last year after T left the seminary . I went with our cousin Mr. Francis Eppes and his Paris friend , that marquis . The protector , however , was in Paris for the time being , or there 'd have been a duel , you know how ' t is . So he was gone two134 SO RED THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation in AscensionParish , and she 's slipped off up here for tonight . The Magnolia goes back to New Orleans in the morning . " " By God , man ! " Edward said bluntly , as Charles went on to describe what everybody had heard of more or less : the quadroon girls , the little houses along the ramparts where for a hundred years these women had lived . They were not prostitutes , they were not slaves , they were free women of color , many of whom had come first from the West Indies ; they were proverbially faithful . A few of these relationships lasted . Most of them broke oil when the white man married . The women then married , to men of their own color . Many of them , when they were older , kept successful rooming houses for gentlemen . Foreign noblemen visiting New Orleans declared the women of the quadroon balls the most beautiful women in the world . " By God , Charlie , that does n't mean , " Edward said , " that I 'm glorfying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know that . Just the same I know you 're not setting yourself up . " " I 'm not setting myself up . lint what 's the use of telling me what 's been written and published ? We all know the quadroons arc given an edurat ion and their mothers lock them in till they pass to the protector . " His own voice , breakingout in the dusk of the road , surprised him . " And so on and so on , " he said , stopping alruptly as he realized that Charles was less concerned about the quadroon than he was about Edward 's good opinion of himself . " You ca n't claim it 's my fault . " said Charles . reining his horse closer to the other , " if she goes and takes it all so  --  the way she has . " " All I say is this : nobody can do anything for her , Charlie , But what is it you 're asking me to do for you ? " " For that matter  --  " SO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't you . You know I 'll do what I can , damn it ! " " Look here , " Charles said , " one thing , of course , they wo n't let her in anywhere , she 'll have to go to some place down there under the hill . " They had come to the Arlington gate , overgrown with trumpetvines , flowering red ; there was a lantern lighted for the carriages . " Here ' t is  --  " Charles held the letter toward the lantern . " Titi Richards , I knew I could n't remember it . " " That would have to be Natchez-under-the-IMP " And that 's what you can do ; you 'll have to go with me . I could n't just not go . " At that moment the carriages from D'Evercux and Richmondcame driving in . Hands were waved from the windows to Edward and Charles , and they rode alongside to the carriage mount . Garlands of ivy and camellia leaves hung between the columns of the portico . In the parlor at Arlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancer , whirling Lucy around , in her blue silk with the sleeves of pale blue tulle and little ribbon bands . George McGehee looked more than ever like a young Louis Napoleon ; and Lucinda , though a trifle taller , rested her long , slender hand on his shoulder and danced well . Down by one of the windows Valette , not dancing for the moment , stood talking with Douglas Walworth . For the next waltz Charles Taliaferro presented himself to Lucy . But he had never troubled to learn to dance beyond what was necessary . A company of people gave hint less pleasure than did one or two , and so now what was only lack of skill seemed to Lucy , in her proud mood of secrecy , to be indifference on his part toward herself . Before the end of the waltz she broke it off and led him to where her father and four or five other guests stood with the host , Judge Boyd , 136 SO RED THE ROSEtalking of the patrols that were being established for public safety . Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rouge were suffering for want of his oversight . He had not spent a night away from home since the autumn , for it was considered unsafe to leave women alone . The negroes had got an impression that Lincoln 's election was the symbol for their freedom . " I should have no fear of negroes , " he said , " it 's the baser sort of white man scattered over this country and ready to scatter firearms , revolt , death . " " Precisely , " said Judge Boyd , and went on speaking of the man who had come last ninth to Woodville as a Presbyterian preacher , bringing with him a very large unmarked trunk . This trunk looked so suspicious that the negro carrying it had been ordered to . drop it accidentally . It was filled with pistols and bowie knives .

" Mrs. Quitman held out her cup to the punch bowl . " We might have known all along you 'd be above reproach , my dear . " Lucy , after the one waltz , kept away from Charles Taliaferroand the dancing . But Valette , before they were half round the room , told him to forget compliments and remember that the time was one , two , three . Her words were sharp , SO RED THE ROSE 137but she said them in a voice that seemed only an invitation to happiness . All the fine houses of Natchez had conic to Arlington that night .

" " But tell me who ' t is you 're in love with here , " Mrs. Bedfordsaid , putting up her lace fan over Valette 's face as if to blockade a kitten . " How sweet those voices are out there on the gallery , " Valettetold herself . " The flame of the candles is like a heart , heart shaped . How beautiful that is ! " " Please forgive me , My Dumplin ' , " she said , suddenly turning the same gaze on Mrs. Bedford . " I 'll settle it . I 'll answer it for you . You 're in love with everybody and everything .

" " Yes , ma'am , " the young man said , making her a courtly bow at the same time that the hand behind his back waved off three other young men who had come up to beg the same dance of Valette . One of these , a red-haired youth who stammered , tried to call out something witty , but before he could say it the white dress and its partner were off into the swirling billows of tarleton and lace . " If you will be so heartless , " Mrs. Boyd said , when Agnes and Lucinda came to bid their hostess adieu . " And Lucy138 SO RED THE ROSEhas declined my invitation to spend the night at Arlington . " " Be careful what you say , " Agnes replied . " We are plain Montrose country people . We might stay on and live with you forever . " " Exactly what I 'm plotting .

" But I 'm sure she 'd rather be our Carlo Dolci , with the eyes . All young girls would rather be sad than eat . " These things and things like them were being said all over the room . Such compliments were very Southern , presented like a bouquet , not so much to penetrate as to give pleasure ; they had a perfume but not intrusive depth , touching the vanity rather than the ego .

And so , as you see , the colonel said , when M. Surget did come to live on the land , he planted right off water-oaks . ' Mrs. Boyd said this in her clear , friendly voice , and  --  whatever she may have thought of Colonel Harrod 's wit  --  laughing , and at the same time straightening her cameo bracelet so that the centralgoddess came on top of the wrist . " The moon is not the sole surprise , " said Judge Boyd . " ButSO RED THE ROSE 139I shall only reveal this much : another swan from D'Evereux .

It was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same moment disengaged and able to make their adieux . They found their hostess outside , standing by the round pool in the centre of the rose parterre , where a harp had been brought out under the swinging lanterns and the moon , and some visitor at D'Evereux , a cousin of theirs on the Bolivian hero 's side , was going to play . Judge Boyd , leadingforward a dark-eyed young lady in white lace , extravagantlyflounced , presented her to the guests around : " Another swan has joined the swans of D'Evereux . " He had been repeating this phrase to one guest after another all evening , but everybody applauded just the same ; and Edwardwould have liked to stay on to hear the music . But he had given his promise . In fact , when he considered his promise , he said to himself that if Charles had changed his mind about going , he would make him go .

XXVBelow the town bluffs and down nearer the river , ran the long winding road , one side of which was precipice ; along the other were the shops , bar-rooms , taverns , gambling houses , slave dealers ' sheds , and brothels . Sometimes the . river carriedoff pieces of the ground where they stood . The streets , sunken and rough , were crowded with sailors from all140 SO RED THE ROSEparts of the world , with young men , with women loudly rouged , thieves , soldiers in uniform on leave , children , Indians , negroes , mulattoes , quadroons , clogs and straying pigs . There were the cries from the wharves where ships landed , the roar of the bar-rooms , street bawling , music , noisy traffic up and down the hill . At night some of the uproar moved indoors where it went on long after the streets were darker and almost empty . Bargemen from up the Mississippi stopped here to barter fur , lumber , merchandise , or to squander and to drink . Travellerson the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the broad river , hounded with green walls of forest , the streets full of all n:ttionts , heard the clamor of these , and took home with them stories of vice , strangeness , and romance . Charles and Edward rode into Jolut Lum 's stable to leave their horses . When he saw who they were , he took off his cap and tossed it on to a peg where bridles were hanging . He had a bald head and an honest face , his nose was stubby and tilted but whiskey red . " Where 's Titi Richard 's ? " they asked John Lum . " Richard 's , that 's in river town . " " We know that , " Charles said . " Rut where ? " " You goin ' to Titi Richard 's this hour of night ? " Charles began to swear and started for the street . " Ah , you arc !

" " Be careful , Mr. Lum , " Edward said ; the red nose pulsingin the lantern light made him laugh , " hide your light if you go . " " Ef I do n't up and enlist , " Lum said , with a single movementturning back into the stable and sitting down on a box . " Otherwise I mought go down the line myself tonight . Yes , sirree , I mought at that . " As they went down the three winding streets spotted withlights and darkness , Edward and Charles did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dancing . Here and there they saw a mustang pony tied in front of a house , Texas pinto ponies with white spots . The orange shops were closed at this time of night , the glare of them gone , but here and there the lights from the liquor shops streamed out against the shadow . Out over the river spread the flatboats and barges with lanterns twinkling among them . At last almost at the wharf was the sign with Titi Richard 's name in gold letters , two of themsmudged out . " Would you gentlemen kindly go to the side there , " thebarkeeper in charge at the moment said , speaking through a sliding shutter in the door . " And on upstairs . The south corner door , sir . Thank you , sir , sholy that 's too much money , but I 'm much obliged , sir . Not the south corner , the otherdoor , sir , please . " A little wav down the street four or five bargemen comingup the hill began shouting at them ; to stay outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs where you can wait for me , " Charles said to Edward . But when they reached the hall above , all the rooms hadpeople in them ; and before he could decide what to do , one of the farther doors opened and Edward saw standing justI42 SO RED THE ROSEinside it a young woman in a green silk dress . She was slender , almost thin , with a full bosom , pale gold-colored skin , and long dark eyes . In her shining black hair , to the left , she had pinned gardenias . Behind her the candlelight of the room was glowing and dingy at the same time . She moved backwardtill she stood in front of the old oilcloth table in the middle of the room . As they entered she made a movement as if to speak to Charles , but with a timid look at him , turned her gaze to Edward and , from then on until he left the room , did not take her eyes off his face . " What can I do ? " she said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving away from the table and coming nearer Edward , " what can I do ? He 's going away and I know . " He could think of nothing to say . I lis eyes shifted to the locket that hung around her neck . A little boy with black hair , in a green velvet jacket , the miniature was set in an oval of diamonds . " I see you know who it is , " she said , following Edward 's eyes . " When he was a little bov. 1 le does n't feel about anybodythe way he feels about you , and now I see you I see how that is . But he 's going to the war . And now I know I 'll never see hitn again . " " Nobody knows that , the way it is in war , " Edward said . " People tell me that old Madame Olivette said things from her cards , but how would she know ? But I know .

And so her voice changed as she asked , " Does he hate me for coming up here like this ? " " I think he 's glad you came , " Edward said , blushing . He could no longer meet her eyes . At the same time he noticed that the perfume she used had spread through the musty air of the room . Charles at the window remained with his backSO RED THE ROSE 143to them , and for a few moments all three waited . Then Edward heard the quadroon come a step nearer him , and her low , passionate voice . Under his foot the floor creaked ; afterwardwhen he remembered this scene he would hear that creaking floor . " I know you are good , " she said . " I can tell from men 's faces ; if I ca n't , where 's the woman could ? Would you leave us here by ourselves ? " Edward nodded his head . " Charlie , I 'll wait in the big room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either at her or Charles , went out , closing the door after him . ' 1 ' 1w latch did not catch at once , and as he stood turning it again , he could hear a low , terrible , reckless cry . Edward walked past the other rooms . He was so absorbed in his own thoughts that he scarcely heard the sounds that came from them . At the end of the hall the narrow stair led down to Titi 's main room . " Hey , brother , " a tall young man with thick yellow hair , his eyes red from drinking , shouted as he saw Edward pausingfor a minute on the bottom step . " Salutamus . " Edward raised his hand to salute , as if they were both of the military . " He 's got a gal up there , eh ? Got a gal up there'n that room ! And you 've got one too , may I inquire ? " " No , " Edward said , coming forward and smiling . The drunken man smiled back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward said . " Salutamus . " In front of the man stood a bottle of claret with two large duelling pistols , one on each side of the bottle , and a bowie knife lying across between them . The man opposite , whom the landlord called Cap'n , kept watching him as if he wanted to leave but was afraid of giving offense . The young man slapped his palm on the table and ordered the landlord to bring a rum punch . " For this gentleman . Your wine 's nothin ' at all , not worth a tinker 's damn , " he said , and turning to144 SO RED THE ROSEEdward , " Pray sit down , trash we meet constantly , but a gentleman  --  raraavis . I 've not the pleasure of your name . " Edward shook hands , introduced himself , and sat down at the end of the table . " Ah , Edward McGehee ? My name 's McClung , nephew of Colonel McClung , Colonel A. K. McClung , know who he was ? Do n't know who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . " McClung now turned to the old man on his left , whisperingloudly , " This is a gentleman . 1 ' 11 tell him about my uncle . " The old man , slapping his mug down , began to sing " The miller 's big dog lay on the barn floor , And Bango was his name . " " Shut up , " McClung said . " You 've cracked your mug and your damned old voice is cracked too . ' The man that hath no music in his soul '  --  but I do n't call t hat music . " " Damn nigh true , " said the old ratan . Ile leaned over the liquor that seeped from his mug and was starting to run along the table . McClung pointed to it . " That 's the way my uncle 's blood did .

Everybody knows who invented it , it was Reese Fitzpatrick , right here in Natchez . Called a bowie knife . And here it is , my man . " " Go on , you can tell me about it , " Edward said , gently . There were , besides the old man , two others at the long deal table , which smelled reeking and sour . Over by the way , on puncheon seats that were split halves of young oaks set on four peg legs , more men were throwing dice ; they were hardSO RED THE ROSE 145customers from the barges . Every little while the door from the kitchen opened a crack so that the landlord , whose name was John Monsanto , could keep an eye on them . " Stop your Cajun talkin ' , " one of them would say to two Creoles who now and then spoke to each other in French . They were talking about the seizure of the United States arsenal at Baton Rouge by the Louisiana troops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militia got the stores and arms . Now and then two negro boys with dirty aprons came in with bottles or plates of ham and river shrimps , pepperedover with cayenne ; but they got out of the room as soon as they could . When there were rowdy voices outside in the street and a knock at the door , one of the ncgroes went and whispered to them , and nobody came in . It was better to lose trade than to have a killing in the tavern . " Tell you about Uncle "  --  said McClung . Edward , as the young man went on , speaking quietly and tenderly , his voice full of sadness and affection , forgot that he , like everybody else , had heard of this United States marshal who fought so many duels that a Kentuckian , hearing too often of the duellist , came all the way to Mississippi to make his acquaintance and pick a quarrel . It was said that the ghosts of the men McClung had killed followed him ; he walked the floor all night or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life he had been an officer in the MexicanWar ; he was also an orator , his eulogy on Henry Clay was read even in the schools . " But indeed , my uncle had a heart of gold , " the young man said , in his polished speech . Upstairs in one of the rooms an accordion was playing . The sound swelled and grew fainter and swelled again , and Edward in his mind saw again the quadroon 's eyes and heard her voice . The old man who had tried to sing " Bango , " began to cry . " Hey ? " said McClung. 146 SO RED THE ROSE " I believe it , " said the old man , no longer crying . " You keep quiet . You 're not fit to speak his name . " " All right , Mister . " McClung pushed the golden hair back from his brow , as he turned to Edward : " Mr. McGehee , " he said , " it was at the old Eagle Hotel over there in Jackson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he poured a cup of water on the floor to see which way it ran , placed himself so that the blood would not stain his clothes , and shot himself in the temple , here , right here in the temple . Was the 23d of March , five years ago , 1855 . Beware the Ides of March ! " " I 'm sorry , " Edward said , pushing his glass of rum away . " I know you are . But your eyes were sad when you came in here . Am I right , your eyes were sac ! ? " " Maybe . " " Yes , sad . I find your eyes sad . You must forgive me . That 's what makes me want to tell you about one night . " He began to describe a fight he had had on the river . " On your steamboat , " he said , turning contemptuously to the captain . His lips curled contemptuously , but the fine eyes and golden hair , and the air of ruined splendor and elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he repeated , " before you blew her up in a race with the Magnolia and went to the dogs , like you are now , nothing but bilge , by ( god ! " The captain made no reply , and McClung , standing up to show how three men had attacked him , rushed along the table . He lunged at the air with the bowie knife , and then , coming back to his scat , took up the pistols , waving them about as he went on describing the fight . No one in the room spoke , their eyes were on the pistols , which were hair-trigger and loaded . McClung paid no attention to them . Suddenly he finished his story , and turned courteously to Edward . SO RED THE ROSE 147 " So you understand how it was ? " " Yes , I 've seen fights . " " But not like this one I tell you . " " No , I reckon not , " Edward said . " May I order you a drink ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The frightened negro boy came in and told Edward that a white gentleman was waiting for him outside . The men who had been playing dice at the table by the wall had stolen out . Save for those at the long table , McClung had emptied the room . As Edward rose , the captain and his friend next the old man , who had put his head back and fallen asleep for a while , got up with him . Both of them were careful to bow to McClung , and to say good-evening , again bowing with formal and effuse politeness . They stuck as close to Edward as they could . As they reached the door McClung jumped up from the table . " Stop , " he shouted , with a pistol in each hand . He spoke first to Edward : " Now , Mr. McGehee , you do n't believe one word of that story . You are the kind of man ca n't believe anything you do n't see with your own eyes . But I do n't care . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you are made . I like you , and I wo n't try to make you say you believe anything . You may go .

" You believe what I said ? " " No gentleman , sir , could doubt any word of yours , " the captain said , solemnly . McClung looked at him with a scowl of contempt , and turned to the other . " Why , of course , mister , no person could doubt a word of yours , " the man quickly repeated . " All right , you two may go . " " Good-night , " Edward said , " I wish you good-night . " The stale smell of the room was more sickening than ever . " Good-night , Mr. McGehee , " McClung said , in his polished speech . " I am honored to have had the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you  --  as I infer there is  --  I am sorry to have detained you . Au revoir . " Edward saw that Charlie , as they walked along , wished to avoid talking , and understood that it was not so much because he was sorry for the woman or for what had happened as because he wanted to get the whole thing out of his mind . In that case , if all Charlie wanted was to get it out of his mind , there was no use discussing it . Ile glanced at that pallor and look of exhaustion on Charlie 's face as they walked along in silence , keeping the middle of the road , to the top of the hill . At Montrose the same night Hugh McGehee awoke an hour or so before dawn . He was a man of great refinement and restraint , not reserve ; and though he liked those he loved to be with him and near him as constantly as possible , he was a solitary man , with the special qualities of solitary men , which arc candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going off to the war , and he lay there thinking of what he would say to him when the time came . XXVITHAT last morning of Edward 's at home , Lucy came upon him alone in the hall upstairs . There had been visitors the day before and some earlier this morning , to say good-bye ; somany of them with flowers that the vases spread beyond the parlors into the dining-room . But now the morning was well on , and only the family was left . Charles was in Woodville , to join Edward there : and Abner , who was to go with Edward as his body servant , had ridden ahead and would wait for him in town . The governor of Mississippihad already called for enlistments , and by the middle of May the number of men responding was to be so great that he was compelled to announce that no more companies would be received for the present . A few weeks after this day when Edwardleft , the troops from Natchez were to assemble for the steamboat that would carry them northward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen had bought $15,000 worth of arms from the Ames Company of Massachusetts ; they presentedhim with a sabre in appreciation of the order . There would be bands of music , flowers , flags , all the troops together , all Natchez there to wave good-bye . But Edward was going away differently . He was impatient to be gone and have it over , and around his heart he felt a hush of tenderness , as he walked back and forth up and down the carpet . But at the sight of Lucy he turned to a bookcase there as if he were looking for some title . Without meeting his eyes she said that she knew his father was in the cabinet room . " I do n't suppose he 'll say much , he just wants you with him . He told me to ask you if you knew where "  --  her lips began to tremble  --  " oh , some book , but , of course  --  " She hurried on past him . The door of the study was half open , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked up as Edward shut the door . " Son ? " " Yes , sir . " " So you 've got a little time to sit in here , have you ?

" " I do n't know if you said money enough , I wish you 'd carry enough . " For some reason he could not have explained , Edward did not take the armchair opposite his father 's , but sat down beside the desk , resting his elbow on it . " I was thinking the other night when I could n't sleep , " Hugh McGehee said , presently , " about this day , about when the time came for you to leave . A man 's mind is a strange thing , son .

There was his father , the MacGregor , and his mother 's father , the MacDonald ; and the great Montrose was dead  --  the MacGregors outlawed , losing their name ; there were two sons , this was the younger one . He was leaving Scotland forever  --  I was wondering if it broke his heart -- -just broke his heart . " He added quickly , " Not , of course , Edward , that you are going away from us forever . " " You want me to go , do n't you , Father ? " Edward said . His father disregarded the question . " You know how ' t is in our family . It 's something to know that you were loved before you were born . " Edward was too young to have any answer , he began to finger the pages of a book lying on the desk , noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trembling of his fingers . " The way I 've been obliged to sec it is this : our ideas and instincts work upon our memory of these people who have lived before us , and so they take on some clarity of outline . It 's not to our credit to think we began today , and it 's not toour glory to think we end today . All through time we keep coming in to the shore like waves  --  like waves .

" Your father would n't know what the world was without that . And think with passion , it 's the only kind of thought that 's worth anything . " He settled back in his chair . " But .

" The door did not catch and swung open again a few inches ; and Edward , without turning his head , reached back and pulled it to . It banged louder than he meant . A little later Hugh McGehee , watching at one of the windows , saw his wife and son going slowly down the drive to the road gate . Edward was on his horse , his mother walking along beside him .

Then Agnes took her hand152 SO RED THE ROSEfrom the stirrup and Edward leaned down and kissed her . Then he rode off , and she was standing by the gate watching him . Hugh rang the bell for a servant , and Paralee came . " I would n't let urn others come , Marse Hugh , " she said , her face puckering as she held back the tears , " yes , sir ? " He wanted to know where Miss Lucy was , and Paralee said she had taken the shears off the hook and gone down to the rose garden .

On the steps into the house l'aralce was standing in his way with her broom and he shouted at her , " Great God A'mighty , what do you women fin. ! to be always sweeping ?

" XXVIION April 29 President Davis called for ioo , 000 volunteers and 366,000 responded . But it was almost May before a letter came from Duncan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting with Dock , the Indian . The wild hogs , multiplied from those that escaped from De Soto 's camps in 1543 , were no longer plentiful , but there were wild turkeys in abundance . Malcolm , tramping through the woods , had his son on his mind more than the turkeys . One morning Mrs. Bedford came in from the garden , where she had been directing Uncle Thornton and the two young negroes under him . They were planting garden peas : the two marrowfats , Royal Dwarf and Peruvian Black Eye , the new Tom Thumb , and the Champion of England , which required sticking . Large butter beans , the seeds from Landreth 's in Philadelphia , had been planted , and Tilden tomatoes , curled India and white Cos lettuces , eggplant  --  every one but the gardeners called it by its other name , the melongona  --  and broccoli , which she was trying for the second crop from seeds imported by Freres Duval in New Orleans . Squashes , beets , snapbeans , and other vegetables were already on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last week in April , and Uncle Thornton had been prodding up what he could . The citron and casaba melon vines had benefitedfrom the heavy showers ; and she had sent a basket of green pears to the kitchen that morning to be poached . On the gallery by the guest wing Mrs. Bedford found Valettesitting by the little iron garden-table , where a letter seemed to lie waiting . Valette sat , with a solemn fixed look , like a little animal that will not stir until his master comes . " My Dumplin ' , are you ever coming ! " " What on earth , why , honey ? Why ' two n't bite you , " she153154 SO RED THE ROSEsaid , as Valette pointed to the writing . " Of course I know that hand as well as I do the Lord 's Prayer . And so do you . Why n't you call me and tell me there 's a letter from Duncan ? Where 's Darlin ' ? " " Dock came and put it here just a little while ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivered as she watched Mrs. Bedford break the seal and open I ) uncan 's letter . A second letter , also sealed , fell out and on to the floor . Either she stooped to pick it up and saw her name on it , or else had seen her name on it already , for she skipped to the end of the gallery laughing , then back to Mrs. Bedford , and began kissing first the seal and then the other 's shoulder , contriving in the meantime to get the letter open . " Dear Valette , I have written Father and Mother that I have enlisted for the South Inn I want to write you too , and tell you I am thinking of you , just as I am always thinking of you . I will write more scx , n . Your own Duncan . " Mrs. Bedford sent her to fen h I ) uncan 's father , and Valette , whirling him out of his chair in the library , flew to tell Mammy Tildy , who was in the kitchen , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house servants came out with Mammy and stood in the court at the feet of Sallie Bedford and Malcolm and Valette while he read the letter aloud . It was only at the last , when she caught the look in his mother 's eyes , that Valette thought of the sad part of the news . It had seemed to her perfect happiness to have Duncan'sletter . " But , My Dumplin ' , why do you cry ? " she said suddenly , her eyes full of tears as she saw Duncan 's mother receive the letter from Malcolm 's hands and fold it gravely . " I 'm not crying . " The small white hands were clasped before her breast , with the letter in them . " The little rascal ! But Duncan ought n't to 've clone that . " " Why , My Dumplin ? Why not ? " SO RED THE ROSE 155 " I wish he 'd waited . " " Do n't you believe in the South 's cause ? " Valette went on , taking one of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love the South . " " But Secession , My Dumplin ' . " " If the war comes here , I reckon I 'll get through it as well as anybody . " And Valette , as she felt the hand withdrawn from hers , understood that it would be strong character , pride and anger that would sustain her beloved foster-nun her . She gazed in silence for a moment into the gray , direct eyes , and then leaned over to kiss the wrinkling brow . On the first of the month Malcolm had sent $4000 , I , : u t of it for books to be added to a library of Duncan 's own , part of it for two of Duncan 's friends , Mr. Hubert 's sons of PlaquemineParish , cousins of the Natchez family who called themselvesHubbard . From the letter they now learned that Duncantook the money and bought a beach-wagon and a team of mules , loaded it with the Southern boys who wished to join the war , and rode off to the battle of Manassas . Etienne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the letter in pencil was written " Victory is ours , " and at the end Duncan promised to write the very first chance he had . By the magic of these things and perhaps through the negroes , before that afternoon was spent , all Natchez society knew of Duncan 's putting the money his father had sent him for books and friends into a wagon-load of students from the university to fight in the Army of Virginia . Etienne and Jacques Hubert were just as bad , they said , and that afternoon the Surgets drove over from Clifton , the Oaklands ' carriage arrived , and Mrs. Quitman driving with Mrs. Wilson , who had stopped by Monmouth to pick her up . In the evening , which was cool and starry , nobody sat on the gallery ; every one gath- " What you talkin ' bout ? ' Tai n't in dcm Yankees to whip him .

" That night when Malcolm had settled himself in bed , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the candle and went into her dressing-room , where a bundle of letters lay on the toilet table . It was like I ) uncan to write letters daily when he first got to a place , and then let weeks pass without writing a line . That was because at first he felt the strangeness and was lonely and homesick . Hut if such was his nature , what was there to be said ? The first of these letters was already faded with age , it was written faun his Connecticut school . " If you can spare an hour from your many duties to write a letter for me I would receive it so thankfully , " it said . " I love every Southern thing with tenfoldfervor . There is a pair of Southern mock-birds  --  rara avis  --  " " Yes , " she said to herself , " and I 've always wondered if that were only a flowery passage . Are there mocking-birds in Connecticutreally ? " " Rara avis -- that have built their nest in a neighboring orchardand every evening and morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I love . If you ever find time please write in return . " Duncan had written thus piously from the college at Mid . dieton ; though , nevertheless , he had stayed but two months and then taken the cars home . That 's how that turned out . " Wife , what are you up to , it 's late ? " Malcolm called to her from the bed in the dark room . He frequently talked from one room to another in the house , as if you sat conversing with him on a sofa . Sometimes he even conversed from the hall to some one upstairs . " There are things women have to do , Darlin ' , you go to sleep , " she answered. 156 SO RED THE ROSE ered in the parlor . Hugh and Agnes McGehee and Lucinda came and Colonel Harrod , driving a new trap . There would be more people next day . Duncan 's letter was read aloud over and over by his father , who every time , when he came to the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war would be over in three months . Very few of the guests during these conversations seemed interested in any of the political questions of the moment , in the proclamations of the two Presidents , North and South , in the news from Europe ; nothing was talked of but the leaders of the Southern army , the unheard of Federal generals , and the men who had gone from Natchez or were about to go . A hundred mes- sages were sent to Duncan . " Be sure you tell Duncan for me  --  " and his father beamed and drank too often with one guest and then another . Sallie Bedford showed them the pie- ture Duncan had sent last month , with that air of a young man of fashion , very quick on the trigger ; and repeated to nobody what she had said about I ) uncan 's waiting until later . Nearly every one had already seen the picture , but all looked at it now smiling , as if to say that Duncan had always been a captain . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when either of them was a moment alone , grew still and grave , thinking , or would go to a window and stand looking out at the world , where spring was green everywhere and birds were singing , and the sky overhead clear and soft . And it was true that Valette just before supper-time went down to the quarters , where she sharply ordered the two laundresses to mind what they did with her petticoats , the Valenciennes had been ironed yellow that week , and then went to Aunt Tildy 's cabin and sat down , leaning her head against the old woman 's shoulder , sobbing . " Go way from here , honey , aim ' nothin ' go hurt Marse Duncan ! " Aunt Tildy said ten times . " Do you think so , Mammy ?

You bought New Orleans out of gloves , I alwayssay . " " Duncan can have anything he wants . You decide . " She chuckled when she kissed his brow . " Is that for me or for Duncan ? " " I 'll just read you the next letter , the second he wrote from Middleton . " From her dressing-room he heard her read : " Since my long &; memorable vacation I find that close continuedstudy is not as pleasant as while at Portobello . When I think of years of unremitted labor , love of ease makes me shrink back almost with despair . I find there is a great differencebetween reading what I please , when I please , and closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" There was the essay " Moral Philosophy , " from the Universityof Virginia , marked Read before the Society , February 16 , 1861 . She would read that again tonight , or at least the last paragraph , where Duncan made his conclusion : " Theology and Psychology have frequently gone hand inSO RED THE ROSE 159hand , sometimes towards intelligibility , but more frequently towards mazy obscurity .

" " He 's no fool , now , " she said to herself , and then , " Darlin ' , he 's no fool , Duncan . " " No , " said Malcolm , " and I 'll say the same for Plato . " " That boy 's sho got sense . " She smiled when this last came into her mind out of long ago . One day when Duncan could barely talk she stood with him in her arms watching old Aunt Tildy 's Thornton pruning a rose-bush . " Son , do n't you like Uncle Thornton ? " she said . " I love Uncle Thornton ! " said Duncan in his baby voice . " Dat boy 's sho got sense , " Thorntonchuckled . Even then how sweet Duncan was !
