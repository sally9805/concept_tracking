txt In the 11 years 1927-1937 the seven largest manufacturers of passenger automobiles made more than S2 , - 375,000,000 profits before provision for income taxes , a Federal sum ey shows . General Motors accounted for 79.7 per cent , Chrysler ior .11. b per cent , the Ford Company for only one-tenth of 1 per cent , while four smaller manufacturers totaled 8.6 per cent . In the first comprehensive investigation of alleged monopolistic practices of the automobile industry , authorized by the last Congress , the Federal Trade Commission today reported pressure and coercion on retail dealers by the big manufacturers , occasional " exorbitant charges " and " deception " by finance companies , frequent " deception " in the delivery charge " F.O.B. Detroit " added to the cost of automobiles , and other grievances and abuses affecting the public and automobile retailers calling for remedy .

Keen Competition On the other hand , despite high degree of concentration which makes Ford , Chrysler and General Motors responsible for 90 per cent of passenger car sales , the FTC reports " active competition " among automobile manufacturers . This active competition , the Commission reported , accompanied by 1 " very large profits " ? " gave to the public improved products often at substantially reduced prices " " Consumer benefits from competition in the automobile manulacturing industry hate probably been more substantial than in any other large industry studied by the Commission . " This follows expel ience of the Federal Monopoly Committee which offered the industry in its patent pool as a shining example of passing on technical improc e , ments to consumers . The FTC study declares that although retail passenger car pi ices are " generally adhered to in , ppearance ( they ) are frequently cut by allowances for used cars , traded in as part payment .

It reports discovery of price fixing by certg in local dealer associations It declares flatly that the manufacturers and " especially " the Big Three " impose on their respective dealers unfair and inequitable conditions of trade . " In the field of finance companies it declares that some " have permitted dealers to impose exorbitant charges and have practiced serious deception or even direct defrauding of the purchaser . " It discovered one finance company " that systematically failed to afford car purchasers a portion of the insurance protection for which they were charged . " The Commission found " an unjustifiable imposition " in excessive " F. 0 . B.

The report likewise shows manufacturers make bigger profit from replacements and parts than on first sales Ford Profits Lag Most startling of the Commission 's announcements did not deal with monopoly , however , but with the apparent lagging Ford profits over the decade , The figures v , ere received almost with incredulity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average Profit , 1927 to 1937 ( 11 years inclusive ) of 35.5 per cent : Chrysler 28.59 per cent while the Ford company lost .8 per cent . The Commission 's only explanation is : " The Ford Company experienced heavy losses in the severe depression years and also in 1927 and 1928 when changing models and reconstructing its factory Independent comment here pointed out that the years for which the .8 per cent Ford loss are shown cover , in part , the transition from Model T. The last Model T was assembled June 15 , 1927 It took about a year and a half to get Model A in full production . But it has been assumed that Ford profits had long since wiped out this transition loss . Various explanations were hazarded . Ford , it Was pointed , has till recently concentrated on one model while his rivals have half a dozen or more . On the other hand , Ford has big investments in coal , iron railroads and the like , which presumably yield profits .

If this is so however , on the scale which might be indicated by the profits of his rivals , Congress may be almost as much interested in a possible tax loophole as in the present figures . Of the three big companies it is pointed out Ford is the only one which has not signed up with C. I. 0 . and avoided labor trouble , but what if any connection this might have with Ford profits is anybody 's guess . At the FTC office today it w as emphasized that the calculations on profits were scrutinized by their n examiners . Dealing with Ford , the FTC report says : " During 341 , years , from June 16 , 1903 to the end of 1937 , the Ford Company manufactured neatly 27,000,000 automobiles and sold them for a little under $14 , - 180,000,000 . The aggregate profit was nearly S978.900.000 Starting with a capital of 5100.000 in 1903. the capital employed by Ford Motor Company was built up by the end of 1937 to 5636,155.735 Of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed funds .

Taking only smaller units , Chevrolet ( General Motors ) accounted for 24.6 per cent , Ford I 19.2 per cent , and Plymouth ( Chrysler ) 15.1 per cent in that year . Smaller companies averaged higher percentage profit than some of the big companies . In the period 1927-1938 Hudson averaged 9.4 per cent , Nash 36 9 per cent .
