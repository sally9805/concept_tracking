POTENT DELTA A STORY BY E. P. O'DONNELL D RIVING down the levee after delivering his last load of radishes to the shipping shed , Branch Carey saw a snapping turtle climbing out of the river . He smiled to himself . Soup for to-morrow ! He checked his mules and leaped to the ground , picked the reptile up by the tail , and heaved it into his wagon . There were plenty of onions , bay leaves , and thyme at home , and Carey knew how to soup a turtle . Clucking his mules into a jingling trot , he continued to drive down past the rain-dyed roofs to Cousin Jule 's Landing , whistling indolently and beating time with his sharkskin slippers . The little President Wilson had arrived . Roustabouts were bearing pockets of rice to the purple grocery and lowering bundled alligator hides into the packet 's hold . There was a white south wind . A bitter blue radiance , unyielding as nickel , sweetened the shadows of the willows and figs , and water and sky were annealed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still whistling , tied his mules to a levee willow and waited for the mail to come ashore . He was uncommonly tall and strong , with jaws and chin thickly stubbled red . A rent in his jumper showed a triangular pad of muscle beneath the shoulder blade , the sinews which the hoe had made . Carey was not a Delta man . Hisdark , indolent neighbors , discerning a wary spark of bitterness far behind his friendly gray glances , marked him as one of alien fiber . But they admired him because he had adopted their ways , yet still was able to lift a barrel of redfish to his knee . He touched his hat to Miss Andersen , chatting on the wharf with Jule , the storekeeper . She was an attractive little Northern girl who had arrived inexplicably some weeks previously and leased a house and orange grove . The Cajin women treated her with civility , but the men liked and humored her frank curiosity about their strange occupations . Seemingly untouched by the heat , the insects , and the staring boatmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as regularly as one with a part in a play  --  always interested , always pleasant , always cool . She suddenly left the storekeeper and crossed to Carey . " Are you Mr. Carey ? Jule tells me you can butcher a deer . I have a deer I want skinned and butchered . " " Sure , " said Carey . " Where did you get a deer  --  out of season ? " He looked down into her proud live eyes , smiling at a vision of her working on a deer 's carcass . She was so small that her chest reached just a bit above his belt . She held her sunshade with a small hand , small nails and knuckles , fingers dewed with tiny hairs , sparse and golden . " From no one but the Game Warden himself , " she replied . " He found it wounded in the prairie . I 'm anxious to taste venison and preserve the skin . And how much will you charge ? " " Oh , nothing  --  for a neighbor . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer him a piece of the meat . Turtle and venison for to-morrow ! " Are we neighbors then ? " " Oh , we 're all neighbors . I how you . " " Yes ? When will you be up to look after the deer ? " " I 'm driving up directly , after the mail . I 'll stop home for a while , then go right up to your house . You ride with me as far as my place . " " Grand ! I 've been dying to ride behind your little mules . " She climbed on the seat to wait . Carey went to the Post Office , where the brown , otterlike face of Jule 's mother peered from a barred window bordered by photographs of mail bandits . Behind her , a blackboard announced a drop in sharkskin prices . There was mail , a package and a letter . The letter was from Marie , his wife , who was at her father 's house in New Orleans with the six children . The package , from Marie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note saying that the dress had been worn only once . Carey pocketed Marie 's letter for reading at leisure . Her letters were always interesting , intensely scrawled and more effusive than Marie was . She had had a lot of schooling . Two of her brothers were priests , and she herself was about to become a nun when Carey , newly arrived eight years ago from the Alabama citrus fruit region , had persuaded her to share his poverty . Doctor Willoughby , dressed in hunting garb , hailed Carey outside . " How 's the Doctor ? " Carey greeted . " The missus all right ? " " She 's put on some weight up there , Doc . " The doctor crushed the light from his cigarette and put the stump in his pocket . " Remember , I do n't want her having any more babies . I 'm appealing to your intelligence . " The doctor lectured Carey but he said nothing about his bill . Carey was relieved . The mailboat pilot gave his engineer two - bells - and -a - whistle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store . Jute was knitting a seine . " You finish radish ? " he asked . " What prize you was get for duh last load , you ? " " Enough to pay for the hampers , " said Carey . " I 've wasted a month . " But he managed a smite . He gave Jule his usual order  --  grits , beans , a bunk of green shoulder . Jule wrapped the package and opened his book . " Charge ? " he asked . " Charge . " Jule had pointedly asked that question every time lately . The bill was getting heavy . Carey was sorry he had grown truck that summer , instead of hunting alligators or working with the shark fleet . Skins had brought fancy prices . " I 'll be trawling shrimp soon , Jule . Probably settle up before the month 's out . " " Bon . " The book was closed a trifle impatiently . Carey drove up the levee with Miss Andersen . To-morrow was another day . The white road , covered with shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river 's whimsical turnings , a wavering strip of vengeful heat , like lava poured by a palsied hand . The Gulf wind had gone , and the heat , stirring only of its own incandescence , enfolded them in a droning . Miss Andersen talked in a voice surprisingly deep in so small a person . She leaned against Carey 's flattened thigh , and on sharp turns braced her-self by grasping his knee . They became friends . Carey was moved by the half-tender attraction of a large animal toward a very small one . And her talk awoke memories of the time when he had lived among articulate people , in his college days when he had been articulate himself . She talked about the Big Smoky Mountains where she had recently lived , clothing her curious thoughts in words Carey had not met in years . " But it 's your prairie that is really the land of the sky , " she said . " In the mountains , one is confined by clouds of rock . Here I am hemmed in by downy mountains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relish . The syllables tumbling from the girl 's shapely mouth so smoothly persistently reminded him of his younger days of lectures and plays . At his house , he lifted her down . He swung her from the seat by the armpits like a child . She was an exquisite little thing , weighing much less than a hundred pounds . After foddering his mules , he sat in the kitchen eating dried shrimp and read his wife 's letter : Darling , I walked on the old banana wharf to-night , and I prayed to the Blessed Mother for your radish crop to be a success . I was just thinking  --  the river water that passed me to-night will he close to our home when you get this letter . If I could see you and our home again , after this long year away ! What are we going to do about living together , Branch ? God has not yet seen fit to show us a way . Carey went thoughtfully to the tool shed to bale a few mink and otter pelts for shipment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new pair of seaboots , fuel for his boat , and twine to repair his trawl , which the sharks had damaged some weeks ago when , pressed for tax money , he had trawled in shark-infested waters . As soon as the she-sharks went south themales would follow . He would hire a negro and do some trawling . He possessed but six dollars . Until the orange crop matured , he would have to live on seafood and the remaining barrel of salted wild geese . He hummed a song . Fortunately , Marie 's father knew how things were , and , though only moderately salaried himself , expected no money from Marie . He took his hunting knife and went up the levee to Miss Andersen 's house , where a mossy roof peered over huddled fig trees . She welcomed him from the porch , and led him to the rear , chatting gaily . On the little rear gallery he dressed the deer , a fat , half-grown buck . The girl watched him peel off the skin neatly , like a snugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thread to close the rent in his jumper , and talked again about the mountains , close to his shoulder . " What were you doing there ? " he asked . " Teaching school . " " Going to teach here ? " " No . I 'm resting and making photos . Let me photograph you some time , Carey . Your face . Will you ? " His face ! Photograph his face ! How  --  he had seen her going about with a camera . But his face ! He had often noticed it , while shaving , but --  " Your face has something that was put there by this strange country  --  the river , the Gulf , the marshes . It shows what a frontier does for and to the white man . The day I landed I saw you walking past the wharf with a shovel . ' A frontier farmer ! ' I thought . See ? " " No . " " Well  --  you 'll pose though ? For me ? " " Sure . Some day when ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness , Carey groped for a possible source of the girl 's glib and trivial notions . Frontier farmer ! Where did such people get their notions ? Where was the point of fusion between them and the grim business of wresting food and shelter from the clay ? He had known school teachers . Out of his Alabama boyhood he remembered one or two . The boys had ridiculed them behind their hacks . They were so gullible and dull . This girl was not dull . A curious little thing , grown more articulate than her elders . She stimulated him , stirred up old dead promptings , made him feel somewhat barbarous . When Marie returned , he would bring the two together , and see what happened . Marie would probably find the other too forward and disdainful of gossip ; but she would revel in the girl 's library , though God knew when she would find time to read these days . He wondered what changes had occurred in Marie , imprisoned for a year in her father 's little city house with six children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put another note into her voice , a shrill , tinny hardness or the whine of resignation . But the bearing of six children had wrought in Marie precisely the opposite effect . On the day she left she had been even more kind and gentle than when they first met . There was about a year 's difference between each child and the next , except between John and Matthew , who were about two years apart . After John 's birth , when Marie 's health was threatened , they agreed to stop having children . But during the ensuing year , Marie had been very unhappy , because according to her religious belief that was wrong . She had grown so wretched that her health was again impaired . Even after resuming her childbearing , she could not forget . The space between John and Matthew was a constant reminder that there should have been another child . After supper , he took his pipe out to the porch . After an active day , with the kids abed , Marie and he had always sought the healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guttural wash , to digest their food and voice the random notions of the day . But to-night , sitting alone with the nasal quanking of some awakened piping-plover , Carey was restless . lie almost resented the thousands of hours Marie and he had wasted , wasted , sitting in the gloom with minds unchallenged and unused . He rose and walked the levee . Trees leaned over from the orchards that lined the road , brushing his shoulder . The over-fecund smell of citrus oils was inescapable . He tried to put Marie 's letter out of his thoughts , and whistled a tune , thinking : tomorrow is to-morrow . But loneliness accompanied him like an ingratiating presence . in his ragged garments and with his unshaven face , he felt abashed before the stars . Why ? Why ? Miss Andersen . . . what was her object , telling him the Delta gripped her  --  with its rotten vegetation bringing forth hyacinths , and its rotten hyacinths bringing forth clamorous geese ? He passed her house . Through the fig leaves he saw her inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrol captains . Stranger ! Stranger ! Coming to view the quaint marsh people . No husband , no home , no purpose , calling him a native ! He turned homeward for his bath in the river . On the bank he grimly cast off his sour rags . But he loved the river . Reflecting , he loved it swinging past his grove , as timeless and impersonal to-day as it was back in the blank years , before the time of the bearded explorers , the redskins gorging on mussels , the bison thundering down to drink . Faint voices came over the water . The liquor runners from New Orleans had kindled their usual bonfire on the opposite shore . They had successfully run in a big shipment of kummel the day before and were still celebrating . Through the merriment Carey heard the laughter of a woman , suave and mirthless . Many times before , while fishing river shrimp in the night , he had marked this sound , the savage sadness of this unknown woman 's laughter , which seemed so much a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cheerful and childish lot . They had been trying for a year to induce Carey to join their ranks , with his reputation for integrity and seamanship , and his fast little lugger , the Cher Arni , swiftest fishing craft below Big Grass Margin . But for Marie he might have joined them . Marie did not share the community 's assumption that liquor running was an honorable calling . Two other voices came to Carey , two men drifting home in their pirogues from Lacroix . " Carey 's Landing , ai n't it ? " " Oui . No light in duh house . " " I expect he 's cattin ' over the river . " " Why his wife is doing ? Still in town ? But she been in town mos ' a year , Miss Branch . " " She 's with her father up there . " " But Christ ! " " Ask Father Raphael . Ask him what she 's doing in town . " " Ho ! Ho ! Don ' want no more baby for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know something ? Miss Branch is fine woman , like you see her . Look how she was nurse her grandpere seven year from malaria . " " They say she kind of lost her mind having the last baby . " " But plenty womans ? " " Shh ! I knew a woman . . . " Carey answered Marie 's letter that night : " I miss you and need you too , but we are poorer than when you left . Ofcourse this is mostly my fault , working in too many directions . This place is too rich . A man is tempted away from what he 's doing . Truck and fur prices are miserable now . I 'd better make a few shrimping trips . We thought by putting two years between Matthew and the next baby we could catch up on finances , but we forgot the children keep growing and getting more expensive . " The future does not bother me . I am full of good plans for a new start . But I do n't want more children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to me now . Not that I love you less , but I always think of babies , babies . Anything would be better than the way things used to be . While you 're still there , try to see somebody , because we ca n't go on as we were before . " Marie 's reply came three days later : " Darling , we ca n't get around the Law of God . People are always trying to , but you ca n't , except by sacrificing your lower desires to finishing the task of raising your children in the Faith . We could try living in chastity . To me this would be a beautiful thing to do . Branch , you are a reverent man , devoted to some power I have never found in life . Maybe you would find more satisfaction in such a state of life than I would . " Branch , troubles mean nothing to me . I am happy when giving my strength to you and the children . I long to return to you and begin this splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yearn for my home and garden and your companionship . The paper says the people of Plaque-mines are going to try growing Easter lilies . Are you going to plant them too ? That would be wonderful , fields and fields of lilies along the river . I 'm staying here until I make another novena to the Sacred Heart for you . Do n't blame yourself because we 're poor . You 've done your best . It is God 's will . " In the same mail was a letter from Carey 's father-in-law : " I hate to worry you , my boy , but Marie ca n't control these children . They are running wild . We ca n't keep them out of the street . They fight and build fires under the house as children will , and I 'm getting too old to make them mind . You ought to take two or three of them home , but do n't mention this to Marie . " Marie looks fine . " Carey wrote to his wife , urging her to return at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faults and virtues , each tree a highly oriented individual following in its own way the pliable law of the many  --  responsive to solicitude , capable of inscrutable whims , of uttering happy flowers or lapsing into Ione and withered revolt . And he wanted to raise bees . For seven years someone else 's bees had been fertilizing his trees . And he wanted to raise poultry for the market and build dykes to reclaim some of the rear marsh . The door opened and Marie stood before him . In her early thirties , she was tall and tranquil , calm with health now , no sign of worry or fatigue , mother of children , mistress of home . Her tender face , that time seemed never to have gnawed or shadowed , glowed through a new , half-opaque radiance which had enveloped her since her return , like an invulnerable robe . Smiling at her husband , she looked like an apparition  --  unreal , unreal , she had grown almost wholly unreal . " All ready for to-morrow ? " she asked , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He patted her knee , cool and unyielding and capable under her dressing gown . " Water drums filled ? Matches aboard ? " Carey nodded . They sat silent , so that he could hear the thin sough of laughing voices across the river , the rum-runners . The laughter was ruthless and sad , like the cries of children romping afar . " You must n't brood , " said Marie . " In the Gulf ? Not much chance . I 'll be pretty busy . Listen , Marie , that 's not bothering me  --  the way we 're living . There 's so much to do . " " Yes , an idle mind . It seemed to me to-day there was a strange look in your eyes . I thought maybe you needed me , my spiritual ... I do n't a storm . They stowed their trawling rig and washed themselves in fresh water . They had taken twenty barrels that day , for a total of three hundred for the voyage . It was not a lot , but it was enough It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed , and a good big setting of lily bulbs . Carey , steering for the anchored cannery boat , watched the green Gulf water rushing past . The Cher Ami was clean again , shipshape for home . The sun was obscured by clouds . Carey now permitted himself at last to relax and feel glad , and to realize the old Gulf , enjoying himself thinking of coral and tarpon cruising patiently through forests of phosphorescent gloom . And the old-time sunken navies , and the buccaneers sleeping down there with their swords . He saw , now , since his contact with Miss Andersen had made him more aware of his surroundings , that he was beginning to win a half-bitter zest from the very fact of life . On the cannery boat , he received a handful of metal checks for his shrimp , redeemable for cash at the cannery up the river , and turned his helm homeward , running before the moist purr of thunder . After they sighted the river 's mouth , the curtain of clouds , concealing the ancient familiar forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena awaiting some foul spectacle . The wind helped them . It descended with ponderous vehemence and scourged the sea into flying fragments that stood poised midair for an instant until a brutal cuff of wind sent them plunging on into the storm 's gray vacancy . But the river was soon gained . Carey shaved no points , but hugged the lee shore , where willows pushed away the wind . He stopped at the cannery to cash his cheeks . They were not operating that day . The village was sunny and young , wearing a festiveair . Near the levee store two blavonians were wrestling for a crowd , and inside the store there was a gleeful accordion . Carey emerged from the office with six fifty-dollar notes , more cash than he had possessed in years . He walked lightly toward his boat , savoring the sun and the sunny wind taking and bringing legions of resplendent cloud . Just below the Cher Ami , a river trader 's houseboat was moored , painted in orange and blue stripes . A woman was laughing inside the houseboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter Carey had heard over the water on quiet nights . From the stern of his boat he looked into the other craft . A woman lay on her stomach on the deck , playing with a baby . When she saw Carey she came out . She was young , tall as a stalk of cane , with a grave red mouth , a lower lip drooping with a fruity heaviness . " Y'all got any fish left ? " she asked . Carey answered that he had a spare sheepshead , and went below to fetch it . He leaped to the houseboat deck . The baby stood beside its mother , wearing a diaper and behind its shoulders an inflated bladder , a precaution against drowning . " How much ? " asked the woman , backing away . " Go on , take it . I 've got plenty more . " " Wait , " she said . She disappeared with the fish and returned with a bottle , and poured him a drink . It was real Bacardi . The woman watched Carey with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then drew the lids over her own eyes slowly , and when her eyes opened she was watching the finely crayoned willows on the opposite shore . She was probably a girl the trader had picked up on the Red River . She wore dungaree pants , one leg rolled higher than the other , and her bare toes were puckered from standing in water . Her eyes brooded and returned , brooded and returned . Carey took another drink . She drank with him , glancing over her shoulder to where a man was sleeping in the stern on a heap of moss , the moss-trader himself . On the deck outside was a display of pink and blue undergarments , cartridges , plaster statues , bottles of bichloride of mercury and Lysol . Carey knew the trader . He pinched the little one 's cheek . " You do n't have to stand up , " said the woman somewhat ironically , smoothing back her light-brown hair . " Wo n't you come under and take a bench ? " " Thanks , I 've got to get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell the nice big man thanks , " prompted the woman . " Tell him us want him come back again . " Carey lifted his stern line from the piling and jumped to his boat . " You 'll be with us for a while ? " he asked , coiling the line , not looking at the woman but hoping he would hear her laughter again in the night . " Yes , quite a spell . I 'm in the cannery for the fall . We 've got a moss depression on the river . " Then the laughter came . It laved his senses like some exotic potion . Shoving off , he heard Angelus bells over the river , three friendly dongs and a silence . And there were his trees , dark and fruitful , through an opening in the willows . Oranges would not be green many more weeks . To-night he would order the lily bulbs . The lilies would push through the sepia loam in bristling rows and rows . With the bulbs actually planted , the banker in Lacroix would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . He saw with gladdened eyes a thin wisp of smoke rising from his chimney . But he leaned from the wheelhouse and glanced backward for another look at the spot where the strange womanhad awakened within him this other ashen ember  --  desire . The children scampered from six directions to surround him . They had grown thinner , hopping about on brown attenuated legs , six little masses of brown bones . They had been eating green oranges . The yard was strewn with green peelings , Marie was praying . She knelt in her room under a picture of the Virgin between two red tapers . She greeted him with her rosary in her hand . Her eyes were red . " Thank God ! " she exclaimed . " I was worried about the gale . An oyster shed across the Bay blew down . " He wanted to announce the result of his voyage , but Marie must finish her beads . Carey stood alone , looking about him . The house looked dismal . The children playing in the yard bad already forgotten him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marie , surrounded by the children , fried the fish he had brought . The older ones waited silently , with watering mouths and large eager eyes , but the baby whimpered , plucking Marie 's skirts pathetically . It would be nice , week by week , to watch their cheeks fill out , and their Little bellies come rounded again ! He would buy corn for the cow in the morning , when he went to pay Jule . That would mean more milk at once . After supper Marie sat next him on the porch swing , her toil-roughened hand stroking his own battered palms . He spoke of the voyage , discussing only its practical aspects . She knew his loathing for Gulf work . Well , there need be no more of that . He had lots of cash . Well , not lots , but enough . Just enough to fit into his good plan . Jule would be paid and the others . The lilies were assured . " And I have some bills in town , " said Marie . A vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What bills in town ? " " Why , our bills . Things we needed in town , the children and I. " " What things ? What bills in town ? You mean little incidentals ? But that 's a trifle , eh ? A few dollars , eh ? " " Well , a little more than a hundred dollars , perhaps . Papa paid them . " " But ? " " The dentist and department stores ? shoes , clothes for a year , our storm insurance . Papa needs the money , you know . He wrote they 're paving his street . " " Sure , he needs it . Well . .. I 'll go shrimping again . After all . . . " Yes . After all ? what ? Another month in the Gulf . Then there would be something else . Always something else . Marie talked on . There was a new captain on the New Orleans packet . John had run a nail in his foot . A friend of hers in Lacroix was seriously ill , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and nurse her friend . " Sure , " said Carey . " You go up at once . I 'll have a nigger woman here to-morrow . " Marie was soon yawning . She had had a hard day . Carey went to his room and emptied his sea-bag . He was restless and lonely . Now everyone was asleep , even the animals in their stalls , and Marie in her room . He had thought his absence might change Marie and himself , but it had not . Marie did not want to make love . Neither did he . His blood had not yet spoken . He walked in the orchard among his slumbering trees , feeling carefully in the dark to learn the growth of the fruit , but his trees gave him little surcease . The oppressive silence pressed against him thickly , crowding him inward against himself . Back in his room , he looked at his clenched fists , gnarled and mottled from the Gulf salt and acid glare . He was impelled tobeat them against himself , to pummel his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not the energy . He was tired and numb . He undressed and blew out his light . Before giving his great body to the bed , he parted the curtains to let in the dark . . . . But waking in the morning in his home , close again to the drip of dew , he felt renewed . The sun drank the mists out of the trees . Carey was somehow contented , and in his great chest , the home of his laughter , there was a response to the morning 's serenity . They had a noisy breakfast in the hot kitchen ; Marie was flushed with activity , and fussed in a pleased manner with the hungry children . After her departure Carey hurried away to spend the day with his trees . The orange leaves glittered like shards of jet . They had turned black at last , putting all their juices into the fruit . The empty fields in the rear brought his sea-worn eyes a misty russet blur , and in the marshes the wind tossed handfuls of fowl into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirogue for the church festival . There he found Ben Smythe , chief of the rumrunners . " When is your next stuff coming in ? " he asked . " Next week , Branch . " " Can you use the Cher Anti ? " " You want to sell your boat ? " " No . I want to work for you . " " Haul for us ? Outside ? " " Outside . That is , a few trips . " " Sure we can use you . You know that . See Brownie . " " What are you paying ? " " Oh , we 'll fix that up . I do n't know what he 's paying . What 'll she hold ? It 'll be so much a sack . All sack stuff now . We load off Breton Island . Route 's all greased , except maybe hi-jackers , but you could ' tend to them . " " Good . " " Good . See Brownie Friday night . Bring two-three good men . White men . " Carey rejoined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to an exciting enterprise , and he found himself forgetting the end in anticipation of the means , looking forward with savage joy to the tense journeys through the night with other reckless souls . It was a feeling which a week ago he would have considered foreign to his nature . The physical risks were few : Smythe , unlike the small independent smugglers , treated the Coastguard as his rightful partners , sent out by the taxpayers to protect their liquor and entitled to share in the profits . But of course there were the consequences , the stigma , as Marie would call it . And it was with regard to this that Carey 's attitude had changed . He was now willing to risk Marie 's respect . He looked for Marie in the crowd , but she was not there . He met and drank with several friends . There were people from every settlement between Lacroix and the Gulf  --  Cajin hunters , guides and trappers , and the folk from the oyster villages . The rum-runners and their women had come over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oyster-shucking and ' coon-skinning contests , and playing the wheel of fortune , operated by Father Raphael . The new Lacroix power plant had started operations that day , and now golden beads of light dripped like resin from posts wrapped in Spanish moss and pungent sprays of lime and camphor . There was a Slavonian accordion quartet ; and a man on a high platform with a spotlight stirred the purple heavens with its swift and pallid ray . Carey met Miss Andersen . She was in a hurry . She took Carey 's hand and looked at him reproachfully . A hasty remark about his not having visited her on his return from the Gulf , and she was gone . The people were waiting for her to perform . The backmarshers felt and enjoyed her dancing . Truckers and fishermen and brown alligator hunters from the Margin all sat on the slope of the levee and played their part , according the dancer the kind of silence they well knew how to create , a round stillness frayed only on its edges by the liquid pleeping of frogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lap of a horseshoe in the levee on densely woven turf , and her feet dealt curving blows to the spinning earth , and her fingers caressed the stars . Never having seen before anyone so abandon the shackles of the flesh , Carey marvelled that a human body could weave such phrases . In the core of the white spotlight she moved , urging the chill white beam back and forth . She would pause suddenly , a small baffled figure ensnared among the strains of music , then float off in whirling haste , giving herself now to the earth , now to the sky , until at last she fell panting , burying her fingers into the cold sod , and the silence rolled over her like a flood . After the festival , at her invitation , Carey left with the little girl in her boat . On the river she was silent . She had grown weary and cold . He gave her his coat and ran the boat himself , and she sat huddled at his feet . Carey , still under the spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of her body , the poignant message of joy and freedom for its own sake . At her landing he moored the boat and followed her to her door . " Wo n't you come in , Carey ? We 'll find a drink somewhere . " " I do n't think so . You 're tired , and ? " He wanted to say something . There was something of importance to say about her dancing , what it had done for him , but too many words waited behind his tongue . And he was confused by his great height bulking above her wistful face , and by their being alone . He had never entered her house socially , but only as her hired friend . " Yes , I 'm tired , therefore I need company , " she said . " And I want to talk about my orange crop . If you can find time , consider yourself engaged to supervise the picking and grading . " But inside , with a jug of wine between them , the girl did not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked of the women of the settlement , her comments were droll and penetrating . She sat on her legs like a very wise child , knowing that her dancing had stirred his buried self . She spoke of her early life , traveling about with her mother , who had been a dancer , and her subsequent drifting about , dancing , teaching , working at photography . She brought out a folio of photographs , curious and interesting views of twisting mountain highways , factory hands working in steam , studies of trees , electric-light reflections , wheels , structural steel . These were the patterns she had seen and captured , like the pattern she had found in his face . And he understood her love for casual design  --  her own life was a casual design . Carey , too , talked about himself as he grew tipsy , and relished this novel role . Under her influence , his long dormant love of talk for its own sake was awakening . Before he left he had told her all of his plans for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child a woman , vital and en-trancing , whose function was to absorb life and give it off , like a stream or tree . Avid for life 's sweet and bitter juices , quick eyes and alert ears , articulate bones and expressive tongue . Sparkling but not fathomable , her rippling gestures concealed a rich secret residue . And behind her urgent eyes and fingers lay the secret , his for the taking .. . . Marie returned in ten days . He was planting the lilies . Showing her the acres he had set , he assured her he had made his good start at last . Now they could paint the house and overhaul the boat . The kids need never go hungry again . He had earned a thousand dollars with the rum-runners . He spoke brusquely , planting the words hurriedly , and wishing he might as quickly cover them up . Marie was speechless . She left him stooped over his work in the field , went in and locked herself in her room . She would not come out for dinner . Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebellion , always , was this refusal to eat . Her children 's father an outlaw ! For days , her eyes avoided his , and when she finally met his gaze , her face was pale with compassion . In the weeks that followed , working under his trees , Carey was lulled into the orderly routine of a man of family . The days were heavy with autumn 's warmth , but the river bad gone frigid as new brass , willow leaves fell across one 's face , and the wind , dwelling in the north , brought flocks of wild geese in floating shreds . But in the shade of his trees , where tentative flowers continued to emerge , it was still spring . Evening weariness was a joy . Marie , too , was apparently contented , placidly devoting herself to the pleasantest tasks about the house and garden ; giving for the first time since her marriage ample time to church work ; keeping the children clean and teaching them their prayers . Now that there was little to pray for the prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie went from room to room in her soft shoes with barely a sound and rarely raised her voice . But he knew that between them a deep tie had been severed , severed . They seldom engaged in talk . There seemed nothing to talk about . The rum-running incident was still between them and would perhaps continue to cloud their relationship . As for himself , he remembered the thing as merely an exciting escapade through which he had got his fresh start . But Marie 's attitude intensified his growing contempt for abstract rectitude . It was the time of long evenings indoors . Miss Andersen visited the Careys often , and the three would gather at the fireside . Marie , under the lamp with her sewing , would lose herself in her stitches , small , careful stitches tracing an irrevocable line and ending in a decisive snap of the thread . The driftwood , laden with chemicals from the water , threw off strangely colored glows , as if it had absorbed and was now releasing the hues of the sunsets it had known and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andersen , watching these curious fumes , would talk by the hour , voicing ideas they had saved for these meetings . If any part of the talk were referred to Marie , she would blink and stare a moment before speaking . One night , leaving the Careys ' , Miss Andersen was unable to start her boat . Carey worked on the engine until it began to sputter , and drove the balky boat home for her . It was almost midnight when they arrived . " I think there 's a drink , " she said , fumbling with the lock . " Thanks , I 'd better go . " She suddenly left him standing there , and went to the porch swing . She sat without a word . She had been strangely preoccupied during the journey . " Well , you may go , " she saidafter a moment . Her voice was edged with scorn . He approached her . In the lush starlight he saw her wring her hands and turn her head away . This gesture and her tone were so strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Good-by . " " But ? " " Go on . Ask me what 's wrong . I 'm leaving this quagmire . " Carey placed a hand on her shoulder . " Come , tell me what 's the matter . " She pressed her cheek against the back of his hand . " What are you ? You 're an orchardist , but what are you ? The strong , virile man , the lonely warrior I think you are , or a craven  --  are you trying to feed on my pride ? Hell , listen to me , this is no time for etiquette ! Lonely , lonely warrior , you husband of the trees ! " Carey stroked her hair , which the wind had chilled and softened . " Why must you leave us ? " " Us ! Us ! " " Come , you know I have a wife . I have a good wife . " " Ah , let 's be frank , Branch . Is she a wife  --  that ghost , walking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with ghosts ? " " Because she 's pious ? What do you worship ? Beauty , freedom , those other unreal . .. She 's a good woman . She suffered to bear my children . She did n't want to marry . Have you borne a child ? She 's worked my fields . She shared my poverty and overlooked my faults for years . " " Is she a wife ? " Carey was nettled . He folded his arms stubbornly and turned . " Is she ? " He walked down the steps to the levee . " No . " He mounted the levee . " Coward ! " the girl taunted . " Cow-ard ! " At home , Marie waited by the fire . " I drifted down , " he answered her quizzical look . " It 's fine out . " " I 've never known you to use the current before . " " I like the current . " He replenished the fire and lighted his pipe , trying to savor the peace of an orderly household . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared away . Even his dogs were often eating game these days . Now he could plan his tasks , pit his brawn against the stagnant ooze , thwart the forces of decay . Happy children , contented wife , secure among his sons . But a man wanted a woman . For Marie all was serene . Celibacy was the preferred state , the only way of avoiding nature 's trap without forfeiting her most cherished prerogative , salvation . Marie was not living , but only waiting . Well , there was something to be said for that form of life , he supposed . It must have been wonderful to find a purpose in life , outside the mere living . He almost envied her . But no , he could not covet her peace . After her years of fortitude she was entitled to spiritual equanimity . Her faith was a powerful and splendid force . Years of observation had taught him to respect it . But a man wanted a woman . Watching the colored flames curl through the faggots , he thought of Miss Andersen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought of the houseboat woman , her tall brooding presence . Her deep savage laughter invited the strong , and this is what he remembered . Miss Andersen and Marie seemed to get along well . Now the girl came more often . On nights when the negress left early to attend preaching , Miss Andersen helped Marie with the dishes and the children . She was telling them a long story , an episode each time she came , a modern story containing airplanes and germs , but no dragons . Then the three would sit by the fire . Marie had begun to appear in more up-to-date garments , modeled after those she had seen in New Orleans , emphasizing the length of legs and contours of the breasts and abdomen . She looked trimmer than Miss Andersen , who usually wore a faded pullover , except that Marie 's bosom was rather full , and her cosmetics , applied with an unpracticed hand , made her look over-vivid , at once eager and unsure . The sewing she no longer brought out . She wanted to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep their discussions in channels familiar to Marie . This sometimes resulted in dullness for all ; but Miss Andersen would soon enliven the talk by some interesting comment addressed to Carey . And Marie gave no sign of resentment toward the girl . Until the night of the storm . They were talking by the fireplace . Carey noticed the fire draught increasing and heard his trees begin to whisper . Leaving the women , he went to the levee . The river was rough , pounding the willows . It was a norther . It had already blown the stars away . " Fix my room for Miss Andersen , " he told his wife inside . " I 'm going to get my lines up before the rain . " Carey attached his ropes to the cave- and sill-hooks on the north side of the house , and made them fast to the stakes in the orchard , taking in the slack with block-and-tackle . It was raining when he finished , and an occasional orange fell on his shoulder . Alter looking to the Cher Anti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room . Marie brought Miss Andersen a nightgown and robe , then went into her room . Carey sat by the fire , hoping the stable would hold . The house was trembling . After a while Miss Andersen came , wearing Marie 's robe , which was about a foot too long . She had pinned up the sleeves and gathered the lower part in her hand . She looked like a child playing grown-up . " I ca n't open my window , " she said . " I 'm afraid it 's stuck . " He followed her into his room . He raised the window easily , with two fingers . He made some trivial remark about the storm and they fell to discussing storms . He told of the great hurricane of 1915 , which had destroyed the orange trees on the lower Mississippi . When he rose to leave Miss Andersen went to the door with him . " You 'd better get those wet clothes off , " she said . " Do you want to take cold ? " He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you ? " " I never catch cold . I 'm used to exposure . " She passed her hand over his chest and felt his wet shoulder . " Good-night , " she said . Suddenly she laid her cheek against his damp chest , standing on her toes . And she pressed her lips gently to one of the large white buttons of his shirt . He took her by the arms , and felt her grow heavy against him . Looking into her lifted face , he loved her . How or why he did not know . In some sweet and obscure way he loved her . She had grown dear . She made him feel the whole of life more keenly . She saw the conflict in his eyes . " Branch ! Branch ! " He wanted to get away . He must take this strange thought away and examine it alone . He took one of her hands . She was his guest , occupying his room , the friend of his wife . With his free hand he felt for the doorknob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've grown prudent . Prudence is wooden . . A very obliging handclasp in the storm , more deadly than if you should send your fist of oak against my lips . I 'm beginning to hate you ! Self-sufficient ! I think you love to be lonely . But it 's killing me ! It 's torture ! To see you working alone in the mist among your damnable trees ! I 'm leaving here . Why should n't I ? Why do you want me to stay ? " " I do n't know . " He opened the door . Miss Andersen turned away . Marie was in the living room , still fully dressed . Her face was jaded and gray . Coming from the little girl , he was startled by Marie 's tallness . She looked gigantic , flashing black righteousness out of a gray cloud . " What were you doing , Branch ? " " Opening her window . We were talking . " " I had already opened it . More talking ? What else ? Tell me , Branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know all about her ! She ? " " You know nothing ! You ! Suspecting me with a child ! " " She loves you ! I know ! She wants you to do wrong ! " Carey was silent . Marie stiffened her back , looming even taller , and looked down the hall . " I 'll  --  I 'll drive her out ! " Carey took her shoulders then slid his hands down and clasped them in the small of her back . " Marie , do you trust me ? " " I do n't know . She 's bad . I do n't know . " " Forget her . Do you trust me ? " " It 's not your fault . It 's her ! Our troubles were all over and we were happy , after all these years . Then she came along , and you 've got to shave every ? " " No , she 's not bad , Marie . She 's our friend . It 's not wrong for a woman to love a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It just happens . You must trust me . " " All right , Branch . I 'll trust you . I 'll understand . " Sitting on the arm of his chair , she passed her fingers through his red curly hair . For a long time they sat pressed together , and Marie 's breathing was warm and quick . She seemed very real then . Once the night was rent by a terrific bolt of lightning . Marie winced , crouching . He thought she was struck . She raised her terrified face , and he smiled reassuringly . Then Marie 's eyes filled with tears . Her features softened into opacity , and she began to weep , covering her face , He tried to comfort her , but she pushed him aside and fled to her room . Later he passed her door , and saw her kneeling beside the bed , racked by silken sobs , Next morning Carey loaded his pirogue with traps and went to his lease on Big Grass Margin . There he worked a week alone , trapping muskrats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the wind stroking the tall bowed grasses , raveling the huge globular wads of cloud , fanning whiter and whiter the fine hot flame of his anger . These were rich days of painted silence , stirred only by an occasional flock of geese plunging toward infinity , trailing a cry of iron . Alone , he was less lonely . One morning at dawn he heard a knock . He was dressing . Expecting to find the man from the adjoining lease , he went to the door naked to the waist , and found Miss Andersen . She was smiling and panting with exertion , but when her eyes met his her red mouth hung open and her bosom went still , Her face turned colorless , bloodless , and her eyes almost in pain fell to the spot on his breast where his heart was visibly pounding his ribs . He would have embraced her there , but Dave Halliday was coming up the clamshell path , bearing two shotguns . And in the couleebehind him a Coastguard pirogue was tied . Carey composed himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We passed by to see if you 'd Iike to come . " " Kind of wild-goose chase , eh ? How did he find my lease ? Pour the coffee then while I dress . This is not the best place for shooting , but it happens I 've got a couple of live decoys . " Halliday he ignored . The captain was a stout genial fellow , and his manner was offensively worldly . During coffee he talked incessantly of the possibilities of the orange country . The others were not especially attentive , but Halliday was prepared for that , providing his own listening and his own approbation . Miss Andersen had perceived that Carey was in an unwontedly bitter mood and watched him thoughtfully . Carey consented to act as their guide . He would see what happened . Halliday provoked him , and he wanted to be provoked . He gave Halliday the two live decoy geese to carry to the pirogue . " Let 's do n't start that kind of thing , Carey , " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no use slaughtering them out there . I never used a decoy in my life . " Miss Andersen lingered to walk with Carey . " I 'll often think of your geese when I 'm gone , " she said . Her face was lifted , watching a flock high above them , and her mouth was curled in bitterness . She was already attuned to his mood . A good friend , she had always made him feel less alone . " You 've sold your lease ? " he asked . " Yesterday . I suppose I 'm through drifting . You 've cured me . I 'm going up the river to find the realities . " They came to the bank of the Bay with their guns . " Those geese are on the island , but we 'll decoy them , " said Carey . " This is not sportsmanship , " Halliday protested . " It 's cruelty , using these to lure the others into a trap . " Miss Andersen pressed Carey 's arm against her . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . We 're cruel people . " Carey waded out with the decoys and dropped the mushroom anchors . They all loaded and waited . The two geese bobbed around like wooden decoys , with round wondering eyes gleaming . Carey , chewing a blade of grass , watched Miss Andersen 's small unhappy face looking through the grass . The decoys , finding themselves alone and anchored , began to call , crying like creatures lost in the marsh . Carey grew impatient . He cursed the impulse that had sent him on this stupid errand . Halliday , the complaisant nonentity in his Coast Guard uniform , had ceased to be provocative . A small flock arrived from the island . Carey motioned his companions to keep still . The geese touched the water , barely kissing it with their bills , then returned to the island . Miss Andersen nudged Carey and expelled her breath . Her eyes were alert with a fierce brilliance . The decoys cried again . The geese began flying over from the island by the hundreds . Then a great cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Andersen , sucking in her breath audibly , rose and fired . Halliday fired just as the flock rose with a deafening churning of water , pounding of wings , and frantic quanking . Carey pumped in a shell and fired again . His aim was true . He leaped from cover with savage exultation and jumped into the cold water , pumping in shells and firing . He kept firing long after the flock was out of range , and the others had lowered their guns , then stood thigh deep in water , looking after the geese in a dazed manner . He found Miss Andersen standing behind him . The water , which barely reached his thighs , came well above her waist . The smoke of their guns had gone . Calm around them , all calm with its archaic green burden of growth and decay , lay the saurian quiet of the marsh . Carey sighed . Somehow , pain was beaten back , and his soul inside his breast had grown still . His sardonic mood had vanished . The hoarded bitterness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . They had plundered the morning of its cunning messengers , thwarted its winged certainties , and this gave him a quaint and pleasant sadness . Miss Andersen breathed softly beside him , the servant of his mood . The girl had something he wanted . Every movement of hers was fraught with a nameless promise . She had brought about his reawakening , given him a new pride in his strength , sharpened his faculties to the shapes and hues about him . But why ? What for ? " Feel better now , Branch ? " she asked . " No . " He took her arm , leading her toward the shore . Halliday came forth to assist the girl up the bank . She sat on the grass while the men gathered the kill . Halliday went far away , wading toward the island under a burden of geese . Miss Andersen , taking Carey 's hand , brought it around her waist and pressed it to her breast . Looking down at her , he was suddenly possessed by his first conception of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arresting whims and gestures . There was an incipient response in his outer senses to the glamour of the strange woman , but it was negative and dull . And under his everyday mind , deep in the guarded region of his ego , beneath his concern for his children , and his ripening malice toward Marie , and his affection for the river and the trees  --  nothing happened . No vibrant answer clamored . No dormant flame awoke . The smoldering core of his maleness slept on , an ashen ember  --  even when he stooped and gave his lips to hers that waited . It was an austere kiss , tender as song , tingling with a quaint purity , until he felt her lips stir , quiver , press deeper , and felt her teeth take his flesh . " Love me " she commanded in a searing whisper . " Bring me your strength and your loneliness ! Destroy me ! " She had something he wanted , but not this . He had been tricked . It was all a trick , somewhere . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sentimental . He smiled grimly and shook his head . Her eyes , looking into his , moved from side to side with his head . He felt awkward , a little ridiculous , looming above her like this . Halliday was near with his burden . Carey stooped to tie his boot . " Forgive me for disappointing you , " said the girl . " You 've been a lovable old coward . " " Cowed by what ? " " How should I ! mow ? Your family , your scruples ? Or because I 'm too  --  too little ? " And she could actually laugh now . The truth was too grotesque . He did not raise his head until it was time to load the pirogue for its departure . He saw Miss Andersen once more before her departure for the north  --  at dusk a few days later , walking past his house with Dave Halliday . She had a flower between her teeth . He left his camp next day . Arriving home , he discarded his pelts on the porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him quickly , brushing his cheeks with cold sweet leaves , shouldering away the sun , hold-ing out fruit . Without announcing his arrival , he leaned on a tree and watched . The children were scattered about the back yard . Luke sat under a tree , crying , and James and John were playing with their pet king-snake in a tub . Marie , with the baby beside her , was working with a trowel under the flaming red poinsettia bushes . She was singing ! On her knees , breaking the rich earth , she was happy , singing as he had not heard her in years . Approaching Marie , severing her song with his constrained greeting , he watched her face , seeing pain now grapple with peace in her eyes . He smiled and hurried past with his paddles and gun , thankful that his burden made it impossible to embrace her . But later as they sat around a tempting supper in the warm kitchen , Marie appeared relieved to have him back . And there was peace between them . Carey attacked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip of rear marsh , a sweet piece of ground , almost pure humus , centuries of decomposed grasses and river silt and deer dung , and here he found a kind of peace in lavishing his vigor . A flock of blackbirds followed his plowing , spreading itself behind him softly , like a gossamer net , falling grayer than the evening . And there was driftwood to chop on the bank of the river . Last summer 's high water had brought down a generous supply , massive stumps from resinous forests of the north ; ponderous logs the stealthy flood had filched from upriver storage ponds ; whole trees stricken while still in their prime and gathered in by the river 's urgent arms . Sometimes he would wander off for a day and Lie somewhere with the clouds between his knees . Or he would watch a levee snake-fight with the loungers , or merely loaf about the store , consciously let himself relax , for a few hours , into the old slough of content-ment , lapse into the sluggish tempo of his neighbors ' lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , which , seeming to sense only a vacant Gulf beyond , flowed languidly through its fecund delta , caressing slowly the thin green bends , tarrying awhile in places , even backing up at times against its own eternal course . Marie thrived . Miss Andersen was gone . Her husband was always near . She was disturbed only when one of the rum-runners visited Carey , attempting to induce him to haul liquor , or dropping in for a chat . They went to Lacroix occasionally on the Cher Anti for Mass . After church Marie , still quietly radiant after the Bread , would go to the drygoods store for some trifle , while Carey performed small tasks about the boat . Once he had a letter from Miss Andersen . She had signed a contract with a metropolitan revue and had definitely decided upon a dancing career . He dreamed of her in the night , so vividly that he awoke and put out his hand for her and called her name . Throttled by a sense of utter desolation , he put on his clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide night engorged him his blood was infused by its abysmal galvanic potency . On the levee the brittle shells crunched under him with an almost electric want of resonance . At the mulatto dance-hall , where a dance was in progress , he stopped to look in at the swaying bodies . Beside the building , in a zone of opulent lunar solitude , couples sat huddled under some China trees . He passed so close he could almost feel the heat of their dark relaxed bodies . He walked until he grew weary , then returned to his home . As he was turning in he suddenly halted . There was fire and laughter over the river . Listening intently , he heard the houseboat woman laughing . The light of the fire cast an inviting path of gold over the water , ending at his feet . " Branch ! Is that you ? " He turned and saw Marie climbing the levee . " Where on earth have you been ? " " Just taking a walk , honey . " " At this time of night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been asleep ? " " What 's wrong with you , Branch ? Tell me . " " Nothing 's wrong , Marie . " " Something is . You 've been acting strange all day . " " I 'm just a little worried about Matthew . " The child was being treated by Doctor Willoughby for a lung ailment . " Is that all ? " " What else could there be ? " " I thought perhaps it was about  --  us . You and me . " Carey shook his head thoughtfully , groping for words to clothe his lie . " It 's not fair to you , living like this , Branch . " " Nothing else we can do will be fair to you . " " Never mind that . Are you happy ? Are you satisfied ? " " I do n't know what that means  --  happy . I get a lot of pleasure from my work , my family . I 've got no worries . I 'm more contented than before . So are you , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well . The other thing 's not important . I never give it a thought . " " Sure ? " " Of course I 'm sure . " They were sitting on the grass . Carey was getting chilled . " I 've got all I want , honey . Things look fine for our old age . In five years we 'll have the best orchard around here . Our kids will be educated . I 've got all I want . " " Well  --  I thought  --  I thought you were suffering ? " " Not at all . I never give it a thought . " Marie impulsively took his hand and pressed it to her breast . " Oh , Branch ! All my prayers are answered ! " " So do n't let that bother you any more . " " And now we 'll have peace at last ! " " Peace , " he echoed . He had not expected Marie would be so credulous . It made him uneasy . His lie had freed her . Yet , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not cross the river that night . He lay in his room , his brain a whirl of confusion . But on the following night he crept from his room and paddled over in the smaller , swifter of his two pirogues , taking a bag of fruit . There was a light in the houseboat , which lay between the bootleggers ' camp and the cannery . He paddled to the houseboat , tied his pirogue , and climbed to the deck . There were loud voices inside . He knocked and a man 's gruff voice bade him enter . The trader , the baby , and the girl were at supper . " I was passing , " said Carey . " I brought you some fruit . " The trader smiled stupidly and blinked his eyes . He was somewhat drunk . " Glad to have you ! Hunt you a bench and eat , Red . Fetch a plate , Belle ! " Belle served Carey with stewed terrapin and a bowl of coffee , glancing sullenly at the trader . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carey talked to the trader . In the too-brilliant lamplight , the viscid smell of food , among the violent colors of the walls and furniture , he looked supremely happy and bloated with evil . Discord lay in the air densely , like a current , jarring colors and jarring souls . The bag of oranges resting against the wall on the floor toppled over gently and spilled . No one had taken thefruit from Carey nor made any comment on it . Carey disregarded the girl now and she ignored him . It was like a planned struggle between them . She knew why he had come ! Already he could feel her will , putting forth an instinctive resistance . Like a struggle between them , it was exhilarating . Fonso , the trader , did not know about that . He ate busily . " More coffee , Belle ! " said Fonso . Belle replenished the bowls with mechanical alacrity . Sternly graceful , the bitter economy of her movements admitted no flourish . The vapors of the poured coffee mounted her arms . These soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick back . Belle and Fonso were a well-matched pair , two grim and taciturn minions of some inscrutable law . They were not married , Carey had learned . Apparently their relationship was on the verge of dissolution . Fonso was a tattoo artist . His outfit stood inside the door , two chairs at a yellow table , a placard with crude designs , anchors , arrow-pierced hearts , blue naked women with emphatic navels . It was not an altogether pleasant visit . Fonso , gulping wine , grew more and more boastful and tiresome . The baby wailed until Belle gave it a drink of wine . Belle sat in a corner , passing tentative fingers over her guitar , searching for a tune , but silent with suppressed fury . Carey felt he had interrupted a quarrel . When he left , however , the girl , biting into one of the oranges , smiled at him over the fruit with her eyes , with something behind her eyes . With vicious joy his paddle flayed the blackness . He must invent errands to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he put the boat in a repair yard by the cannery . Thereafter , visiting the works each morning , he contrived to reach the opposite levee when Belle was on her way to the cannery . And he would paddle her the remainder of the way . She would descend the levee in answer to his call and sit with her hands in her lap and her back toward him in the pirogue . Away from the houseboat she was shy , speaking only when addressed . And always there came from her a smoldering resentment , as though it hurt her to be alive  --  a self-resentment , disappearing only in her sudden plays of humor , her poignant and ravishing smiles . Then he went over three times weekly for a sack of oysters , arriving at the shucking shed next the cannery just before the deep-throated quitting-time whistle commanded the workers to hurry away and rest for to-morrow 's toil . Emerging from the factory with her Slavonian girl companions , and seeing Carey waiting , she would smile faintly , almost contemptuously . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually to where he sat , and they would chat on a sack of oysters by the river . She was openly suspicious , expecting him to begin patronizing her at any time . Usually , educated fellows began by trying to improve one 's mind . Carey tried to feel casual , but within himself he thrilled to the element of illicitness in these hours . Free from formality , the situation wore the aspect of those na  --  ve , artless courtships characteristic of the river people  --  two persons dwelling near each other drawn together by a mystic and irresistible urge , the woman , not eager as Miss Andersen had been , but reluctant and moody ; the man fatefully persistent , biding his time but keeping his will focussed , his male attributes directed on the deep , fateful objective . So through the weeks Carey pursued her . There was no sense of lust . Hehad forgotten lust . It was a game of hidden forces , and both contestants foresaw the outcome , and both relished it still . And between them there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shadows . She was lonely too . Walking toward each other on the levee , they cast aside that dun proud mantle of loneliness . . . . One morning , when the seat in the pirogue had been splashed , he removed his jacket and placed it there for Belle to sit on . She was in an ugly mood that morning . She looked at the garment on the seat and smiled disdainfully . " Take it away , " she said . " Why should I be sitting on your jacket ? I wo n't get in until you move it " He removed the jacket . She stepped into the pirogue and he began paddling away , saying nothing . " I do n't want you getting high-toned with me , as if you were in love with me , " said Belle , trailing her fingers in the river . Then she raised her eyes and searched his face . " High-toned ! " he laughed . " High-toned ! " " Yes  --  high-toned ! Do n't laugh , either . Who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all you are . You 're not so respectable as a person would think that sees you sailing your folks to church Sundays . Do n't act respectable with me . What do you want from me ? Do you think I 'll make Captain Halliday look the other way , like I suppose Stella Andersen did for you ? " Carey paddled in silence , thinking not of the girl 's bad manners , but seeing himself , bitterly , as the world saw him  --  the traditional social hypocrite . When they reached the cannery pier he helped her up the ladder , then swung his pirogue away at once . " Fonso 'll be away to-night ! " she suddenly called from the wharf . Carey backed water . " Away ? " " Yes . He 's hired out to the ' leggers . They 're bringing in the Christmas stuff . " " I see , " said Carey , paddling away with deep , sure strokes . That night he crossed the river to the houseboat . Approaching the other shore , he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houseboat . He stepped ashore a few yards below the craft , mounting the levee cautiously , to learn if the girl were alone . It was a soft night , warm ashore , and heavy with stars . Carey sat crosslegged in the grass . A few feet away , Belle with her guitar sat on a drift-wood log . The log had a fat , crustacean look , three long ciawlike roots on the end jutting upward , clutching . Belle sat for a while with the guitar in her lap , looking across the river toward Carey 's landing , in a manner that indicated she thought herself alone . Then she gathered her legs under her until their glowing whiteness above the knees was dimly visible , and played a song . She played like a negro , the same indolent plucking out of bland muted rhythms . She knew how to lean dreamily on the lower strings , to linger around her minors , to keep the more passionate phrases from hurrying off . When she finished Carey clapped his hands playfully . " You scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He rose and crossed to where she sat on the log . " I 'm subject to that thing myself , " he said jovially . " Let me play you something . " " If your wife do n't mind . " " She taught me to play . " " Did she teach you manners ? Did she teach you to be high-toned and say big words like ammunition and ery-sipelas ? " She left his side and sat on the opposite end of the log , curling up between the clawing roots and nestling there , a compact and sullen shape . After play-ing , he went to her and offered her the instrument . " No , " she said . " You play . " " You were n't listening . " " Do I have to listen ? " " What are you crying for , Belle ? " He sat beside her . " Go on and play . " Her curved back was bard . She had clenched herself together like an angry fist . " What have they been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing me ? " " What makes you unhappy always , Belle ? " " Nothing . I 'm sick of being his animal ! " " Ca n't you leave him ? " " Sure . Leave him and be someone else 's ? Be your animal ? He wanted to tattoo me again to-day , mark up my arms . That 's his idea of skylarking . Every time he gets boiled . I 'm his chunk of meat . " " Leave him then . He 's nothing to you . " " Nobody 's anything to me . I want nobody . " " I would n't say that . See here , let me help you . " " The boy with the magic lamp ! " He felt her draw herself more closely together , harden herself against him . She was hard , bright and hard , he felt . And he wanted her hardness . She was his heart 's woman . He would marry her . " It would make me happy to help you , Belle . " " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know what you want . You want what they all want . " Yes . " He felt her slowly relaxing against him , unfolding her tight resistance , as a ripened bud opens . Kissing her throat , he felt a glad tremor spread down through her body , like swiftly growing roots . He stood above her , shoulders thrown back . His limbs were molten , planted in black flame . He took her hands , urging her away toward the levee 's crown , where the sand beneath the grass still husbanded the warmth of the sun . They stood embraced . On the brink of the moment possessive , Carey stood bereft of utterance , deferring further ecstasy to realize that their woes had merged and their wills had blended . The heat of her response blinded him like a vapor . " I 've got to go ! " she whispered into his mouth , fighting an imminent swoon . " Jesus , Red , you tear me to pieces ! " " With me ! You 've got to go with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crying ! Come Thursday night . I 'll be here at ten o'clock , after she 's asleep . Will you ? " " To-morrow night ! To-morrow night ! " " No . He 'll be back ! He leaves again Thursday ! " " Him ! Who ? What do we care for him ! Wait ! There 's a little house down the river where you can ? " She broke from him with a strength that matched his own . He stood on the levee , collecting himself . Then he realized the kindly night . In his blood was a singing , high and triumphant , and all these friends of the night were part of the paean -- the river hiding its deeps , the tall grave stars , the unseen swamp rodents mating in muteness . Thursday night was starry and cold . Carey , seated in his pirogue , bore on the pin-prick of light from the houseboat . Halfway across he encountered a moderate north wind . He looked for clouds , but the northern horizon glowed in a purple quiescence . Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistling softly , remembering sharply their previous meeting . He could not recall how she looked now . The details of her face eluded him  --  only her laughter , his ears could hearher laughter at will in the dark . Hereafter , whether he married her or not , he would like to go to her in the night only . It would be like a potent , half-sinister dream from which he would awaken to resume his peaceful tillage of the trees . . .. He would persuade her to-night to leave Fonso and move into the little house he had in mind . The wind had grown from moderate to half a blow . Drawn into his nostrils , it stung the membranes in his head . On the river it had set up a faint seething . Carey buttoned his leather jerkin and glanced at the northern sky uneasily , but the stars were still there . He heard the woman 's voice , " Red ! " and went forward and took her in his arms . " The little vixen like to never went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nigger woman I 've got to stay with her . Watch out for my arm ! " Her arm was bandaged and she smelled of liniment . She explained that she and Fonso had had a fight that morning . Fonso had tried to brain her with a pot , but she had blocked the blow , taken it on the arm . Her husband , little Lizzie Belle 's father , had taught her how to block a lick . He had been in the ring . Her arm was almost cut to the bone . Her free hand slid under his hat and clutched his hair , drawing his face down , grinding her lips against his . " My big Red ! / adore your hair ! " Brain her . Fonso wanted to brain her . Carey envisioned the scene  --  the baby screaming in a corner , Fonso advancing with the uplifted pot , bent on spattering his woman 's brains over the walls . Sordid ! Sordid ! And he had come here for peace . Stealing across the night , fumbling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you miss me , Red ? " " I 've thought of nothing else for two days . " POTENT They sat on the log , and Belle rested her head on his shoulder . From her matter-of-fact recital of the incident , he gathered that Belle accepted men as brutes of prey , using women only to cool their lust . Women gave themselves in return for a certain security , but were ever vigilant of being taken advantage of . Her life had taught her so . Soon , she would take this attitude toward him . " Listen , none of your foolishness ! Why did n't you come last night ? " And why not ? Why should n't she regard him with suspicion ? What , after all , did he want of her ? Carey 's thoughts stopped in confusion . The thing had lost some of its glamour . Then a twinge of pity for the girl sent his mind straying behind her into the drab vistas of her future , ending her days a houseboat hag , selling lysol to factory girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The magic had gone from her touch . Weil , he had a woman now . Marie 's prayers were answered . She would go on being a good woman , and happy . In the wind he half-heard Belle recounting the details of her tussle with Fonso , how she had worsted the man , wresting the pot from his hands and finally chasing him up the levee with a gun , and how the Slavonians had laughed at him running up the levee . On the opposite shore a light came suddenly , telling him Marie had put a lamp in the dormer window of the upper front room , the empty room , they called it , or plunder-room . Marie was happy these days , making fruitcakes for the poor , having a neighbor in occasionally for a chat , bustling about all day with the Christmas preparations . The small yellow burr of light burned steadily , marking his home . It would continue to burn until , back home again , he extinguished it himself . It was Marie 's custom when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading lamp in this window . Marie was afraid of the wind , since her youngest brother had been caught midstream in a light pirogue during a blow , years before , and drowned . To-night , awakened by the wind , she had doubtless gone to Carey 's room and found it empty . Then she would put on her muskrat coat and fight through the wind to the landing , to learn which of the pirogues he had taken . Finding the larger one there , she would be alarmed , and hurry in to light the beacon lamp . At this moment she would be in her room praying for his safe return . With Marie prayer was not an escape . It was a state in which , once entered , there was simply nothing more to escape from . She would have made an exemplary nun . Praying for his safe return ... he had better not keep her waiting too long . Looking down at the woman beside him who was now watching the light in his dwelling and perhaps guessing his thoughts , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both , two vagrants in the dark , small and bowed , huddled over an austere question they were not tall enough to ask . Carey 's arms moved , gathering in the fellow of his loneliness . " Belle , " he whispered , now forgetting that he had been tricked again .
