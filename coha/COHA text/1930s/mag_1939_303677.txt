An affidavit filed last week with the U. S. State Department by a U. S. survivor of the Athenia , momentarily revived World War II 's first major incident as a sulfurous fount of propaganda . Encouraged by three U. S. Representatives-South Dakota 's Case , Louisiana 's Brooks , Oregon 's Pierce-one Gustav A. Anderson , travel bureau operator of Evanston , Ill. , came forward to swear that Chief Officer Copeland of the Athenia told him that the ship carried " plenty " of guns for Canada 's coast defenses and for fitting herself out as a raider on her return trip . He described an air of tension aboard after the ship cleared Belfast and Liverpool on Sept. 2 : repeated , ominous lifeboat drills and inspections before &; after war was declared by Britain on Sept. 3 . He remarked the fact that the Athenia was still floating some 14 hours after being damaged , said he had heard British destroyers finally sank her as a dangerous derelict . Mr. Anderson was at dinner when the explosion occurred . He had nothing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three Representatives interested in Mr. Anderson 's story , one was an Isolationist . Ammunition for House debate in coming weeks was what they furnished . Embarrassment to the Donaldson Atlantic Line ( owner of the Athenia ) was what they caused . Said Donaldson in Glasgow : " Tommyrot and absolute nonsense ! " <P> Great joy was what the Anderson story brought to the heart of Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels , chief propagandist for Adolf Hitler . Hitherto personally muted since war began , Dr. Goebbels last week seized this occasion for a full-dress radio tirade against Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill , British Admiralty chief . He said Mr. Anderson " proved " that Mr. Churchill had the Athenia blown up with a bomb set off aboard at a wireless signal , later had destroyers finish the job . Direct translation of his remarks in German ( which were toned down , as customary , in an official English version ) read : " That was how you planned it , was n't it , Mr. Churchill ? That was how it was carried out also and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncovered your whole scheme ! <P> " The Athenia case is now the Churchill case and the Churchill case has developed into the British case . It is now a question of whether proven criminals are to continue to be tolerated in such a high official position or whether the indignation of the world is stronger than the unscrupulousness of a notorious British liar . There is no doubt , Mr. Churchill , that you will be found guilty by any court of justice-now you are standing before the judgment chair of a world tribunal . The accused , Winston Churchill , now has the floor . . . . Stand , rascal , and answer us ! "
