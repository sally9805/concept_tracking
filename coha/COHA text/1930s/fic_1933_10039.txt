the girl found herself answering sentence for sentence , conscious of the little fellow 's goodness . He talked so warmly and sincerely . The minutes flew . Then Leon caught himself . He laughed , and he himself was surprised at the new note in his laughter . " I was going to help you fix things up , " he said , laughing . She got up , shuffled about in her large , sloppy houseslippers , and made the beds . She made them rather untidily . As she bent over , drawing the sheets taut , her hips strained through the dress . Going about in house-slippers without heels gave her a solid way of walking . Parts of her body shook and quivered . She was like a large , healthy , female animal . Leon got up and began putting things in order . While he stood upon a chair , Comrade Helen handed him things . They hung old curtains at the windows . The beds they rearranged . Moving them was work , Leon grew warm and took his jacket off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy lifting and shoving , while Leon , burning in the face , grunted as he helped and pushed things about . Both began to perspire , the thin dress of Comrade Helen stuck to her back . But the place took on a kind of order . In half an hour the flat looked different . They sat down to rest , smiling at each other , telling one another they looked warm and perspiring . Leon took his tie off and wiped his face with his handkerchief . Then Helen stood on a chair , reached up into the shelves over the sink , and brought down a bag of apples . They sat there eating them , talking . At four-thirty , while they were still eating apples and talking , the doorknob rattled . Leon stiffened . Jose came in ; he grunted when he saw the little painter . He had been distributing leaflets all day long in the cold , had beenp101turned down by the very people he had wanted to help , and in the end had been chased off by the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw his old misshapen hat on the bed , and hunted around for bread to make sandwiches . He had brought a dime 's worth of cheese along . Sitting down at the table , his back to Leon , he sliced the bread in thick hunks , slapped them together against the cheese and started eating , his powerful jaws going up and down like pile-drivers . His broad , firm back stared hard at Leon , he made no move to turn around . No one spoke for a while . Leon , uneasy in the chair , re-knotted his necktie . Jose was sitting on the little fellow'sjacket . Leon noticed how Comrade Helen looked at the Mexican , at the hard way in which he sat ; he saw now who was boss around the place and his heart started hammering . Finally he stood up to go . He went over to the table and gave a tug at the corner of his jacket . Jose went on eating . Leon tugged again , Jose lifted one side of his rump and the crumpled jacket came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went toward the door and started to say something , but found he could n't talk . Helen rose and stood at the door with him . Jose was making another sandwich and , looking at him , Leon saw the broad , firm back again , the thick , strong neck bent forward as the fellow sliced the bread . As he opened the door Helen thanked him for helping . She was a little business-like about it . " There 's a draft , " said Jose , without turning around . " All right , " said Comrade Helen shortly . " I 'm sure you wo n't catch your death of cold . Good-bye , " she said to Leon . " Thanks . " The door closed , he stood out in the hallway . Well , why did n't he move , why was n't he on his way ? Did he want to overhear something , had he turned spy ? He stood there rooted , his legs unflexing . Pretty soon he heard an argumentstart up , he heard a chair go scraping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Comrade Helen answered . Leon , stock-still in his tracks , heard . How her voice changed ! She could be shrill as a fishwife , she holleredJose down . In two minutes a hot argument was going , epithets flew up and back . Leon , his soul vised , rushed up the narrow hallway . He heard a crash like smashing crockery , a woman 's scream , then was on the street and heard no more . He was all the way to Thirteenth Street when he reminded himself that he had n't seen Jason . He stopped , whirled about . Then he remembered he had nothing special to see Jason about anyway . BIG CHIEF RUNNING WATER , his wide bulk filling the doorway leading to the office , stood looking at the hustlers rolling the merchandise away , stood listening to the small , well-oiled wheels of the trucks going over the smooth iron floor . The eleven hustlers , at first unaware that he was watching , went their carefree way , wheeling , bending , stopping , slamming the boxes and crates down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the stuff no damage . Each bang , each dumping was calculated by the micrometers within those loyal ivory skulls ; each man knew his task , how much pressure to exert at a turn , when to lean against the load , when to heave ho , as the saying goes.  |p103Old  Running Water , standing there within the boundarylines of his shanty of an office , surveyed the scene from his poop-deck , cocked his eye to left and right , for signs of sun or rain , saw only the dull iron floor and the burning electric bulbs and took a puff from the stump of cigar between his teeth . The eleven hustlers heaved off again , the Big Chief stood in the shade . Hank Austin , good old Hank , whose ancestors battled for freedom and the right to drink tea without English tax-stamps glued on the boxes  --  old Hank ( he was young ) was second in line , shoving a load along . The man behind , a pal of his , whipped a few words forward , a wise-crack , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words back himself , his head jerking as he laughed , his mouth wide open carelessly . At that moment Old Running Water , still in the shade , narrowed his eyes ( movie fashion ) , clenched the cigar butt firmer between his teeth , and the nail was driven deeper within that brain of his . The Big Chief went into the office and settled his solid , very hefty bulk into the chair . Then he called for the ledger again , slapped the wide book open , turned the sheets and looked them over  --  and after Henry Austin 's name he put a thick dot , making it with his big , soft pencil , a careful dot . The pencil point worked round and round , nice and black and perfect to look at . Before he knew it , Old Running Water , moving his ample hindquarters two points east by southeast in the wide chair , had quite a dot there  --  it stood out like a small , circular piece of soot from the whiteness of the page . Cocking his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the iron floor . The foreman came in , laid a sheaf of shipping bills down , sheets which were marked up in blue , red , and green pencil , strode out , and told the men where to put the new load , that big shipment of unmixed paint just come in from Milwaukee , via ship and rail . " Over there , " he ordered , pointing to the forward wall . The men obeyed , and once more the trucks rolled by , each hustler passing the office door , eyes upon the guy 's shoulders ahead , arms hard and rigid from the load . They went up and back like mine-workers in a shaft five hundred feet below . At the east wall of the warehouse the big freight elevatorshauled up load after load , slamming their big , wide doors . A cold draft blew up the shaftway , the men wore two sweaters under leather vests ; on their hands were yellow , rawhide gloves . If a man shouted , his voice bounced off all the walls and had a hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , circling around the trucks and boxes . In the office Old Running Water , his mind flowing on like heavy honey from a jar , sat thinking slowly , his pencil in his fist , his old eyes staring into the hollow of the mouthpiece . The phone rang . The kid at the small desk dropped his mystery novel into the ready , opened drawer and shut it smartly . The ring was on his extension . " Consolidated Warehouse . Yessir . Two loads at Pier 43 , Cunard Line ? All right , our trucks 'll call in the morning . Bye . " The receiver jiggled into place , the drawer below opened craftily , the lad dipped down and pulled up his book again . He started reading , resumed where he left off . . . " Just then Professor Farrington , late of ScotlandYard , swung his lean , muscular body over the iron fence of the mansion on the hill and in the flash of lightning that followed saw sprawled out in the tall , wet gress the body of Lawyer Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' he gasped . A long , narrow , evil/looking knife lay at the body 's side , with no blood on it . Professor Farrington , wrinkling his brows , straightened up at the sound of whirring wings , and at that moment from the sycamore tree on top of the mansion hill an owl hooted three times softly . Dirk again ! ' said the professor and stood up and looked sharply all around . . . . " The phone rang . The kid dropped the book into space again . This time the call was for Old Running Water , who lifted up a beefy arm , took the receiver off the hook , and , listening , began playing with his soft , lead pencil as he answered , making the round dot opposite Henry Austin 's name bigger and bigger , until the dot was as large and black as a good-sized bullet hole . IN THE DAYS that followed , Leon ( at first timidly ) came over many times to help Comrade Helen straighten things out , starting out from his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be around . When he arrived , the flat was always in disorder , the three comrades , Jose and the Turner brothers , did not lift a hand about the flat . Leon , with one eye on the artistic possibilities of the rooms and the other eye on Helen 's figure ( his soul torn between the two ) , put things straight , rearrangingthe furniture almost every time , making an excuse for his visits . In a short time Comrade Helen grew accustomed to seeing him coming over often and would allow the rooms to remain in a disordered state , until the little fellow put in an appearance . He always stood quietly out in the hall a while , before he lifted up a hand to knock . A few times , as he waited , he heard squabbles , and went away without rapping.  | December came on  --  gray days , cloudy days , nights of rain and chilly wind . No snow had fallen yet , but the rawnessof the weather was worse than a storm . In the slums life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours before the charity headquarters opened up , lines of the living dead , and bundles were distributedto the holders of cards , heaved over the counters . The people stood outside pressed against the wall , slowly moving forward . At the corner a policeman was on duty , but had nothing to do . All was humbleness , all was meekness ; there was no flare-up at all . Folks took their packagesand left , cutting down side streets , each man or woman going his own way , hoping they would n't meet any of their neighbors . In the tenements the little coal stoves burned only in the early morning and toward nightfall , when it was coldest . Fuel was sold by the bag , a dollar for a short , squat sack of hard coal , bringing the rate up to twenty dollars a ton ; there was no way to check the weight either , by expertpacking a sack could be made to look fuller than it really was . The small-time venders , wheeling their handcartsup the streets , shouted : " Coal-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the Italian what floor to come up to . And at five o'clock , when darkness fell , women with their kids were foraging for firewood , wheeling their babybuggiesor even carrying old ropes or rags to tie up the sticks . They hunted around the rear platforms of furniturecompanies , factories , drygoods stores ; and if a box was sighted , the fastest of foot got the booty , with the others hating the winner . On First Avenue , where the outdoormarkets crowded each other onto the street , stale fruit and half-rotted vegetables were sold toward night/fall , and by careful plucking and picking a housewife could occasionally get a downright bargain . Every family handled its own washing . Clotheslines were strung inside the rooms , up and back , zig-zagging ; the steam from the damp garments covered the windows with mist , making the place look warm and cosy , but when you blew , vapor came from your mouth in a long column . Every day , every night , the leaders of our country gave this serious situation their undivided attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were held in the finer hotels , representatives of big business gave reassuring talks over the radio , financial journals made bi-weekly predictions , quoting graphs and charts ; and politicians , their eyes on coming elections , faced the problemfrankly , but when they were through talking you found they had promised nothing definite . A few of them ended their speeches with staunch , heroic words : " The American people , bravely facing this severe and prolongedcrisis , are coming out of this darkness into a new dawn , with the customary ruggedness that has always been our heritage since those hardy days when the pioneers , in the face of overwhelming odds , pushed westward in their covered wagons , opening up this glorious country of ours . . . . " Along Fourteenth Street shivering men stood in the doorways of radio stores listening . The music from the taxi-dancing jazzbands blared out upon the street . In the square Comrade Irving Rosenblum harangued the multitude , giving them the lowdown on the whole rotten situation here at hand . Each oration he opened solemnly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no spittle flying yet , his face still calm ) "  --  fellow workers " ( looking the citizenry over ) ,  | " here in America , in the greatest , the richest country in the world , with warehouses filled with food and clothing , ten million people are unemployed and hunger stalks the land . " ( A glance around , allowing the words to sink in , waiting for a Fourteenth Street trolley to rattle by , watching a few shabby geezers ambling over . ) " Fellow workers , you are living in the United States , in a land of liberty and freedom . You have a voice in the Government . Yes , you have . As a member of the Unemployed Council , I , with a group of other comrades , journeyed up to Albany , the Capitol , and demanded unemployment insurance , lower rents , and a fifty-million-dollar appropriation for unemployment relief . " ( Some figures , that 'll wake ' em up . ) " And when we got there , fellow workers , when we reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs to talk to the Governor , we were met by the police . We came unarmed , but were given no quarter , we were beaten and clubbed , four of my comrades so badly they are still in hospital . I myself was hit over the head and stunned and was sick for three days . This , comrades , was our answer . " ( A pause , now the little fellow swallows , he 's getting warmed up , Rosie is . ) " Fellow workers " ( the sarcastictouch coming , the bitter-humored stuff ) , " you need not worry , everything will be all right . Just sit home and take things easy , toast you toes at the stove . With the right men in office as we now have " ( a knowing , sour smile flecking his lips ) , " it will only be a matter of time , maybe a hundred years , maybe two hundred , but do n't worry , my friends , everything will straighten out . If you do n't live to see better times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ( No applause , a few grim smiles , some of the citizenry shift slightly in their tracks . ) " Comrades , you may not know it , some of you may be entirely unaware ,  |p109but  the fact is , there is a great war going on  --  the Class War , capitalism against the working class . Which side are you on ? " ( He stares at the shabby geezers who have wormed their way up front . ) " Which side ? There can be no compromise , it is a battle to the finish . . . . " ( Here another trolley rattles by , Rosie takes in a good deep breath of air . ) " The Communist Party of America fights for the working class , protects the workers , it is the only party in America with a militant platform . Fellow workers , I tell you that . . . " ( Now he has hit his stride , from then on the little fellow 's mouth rattles like a machine-gun . ) December still came on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-poet , ex-communist , former student of world affairs , bard of the famous tenement known to all as Twenty-Door City , sold another sex-story and received a check for eighteen dollars . Some of the money he spent on gin , some against his rent bill , the rest he donated to Pete , who ran his " source of supplies . " The lights of the Crystal Lunchroom burned brightly . " An army crawls on its belly , " said Jason , sipping a fourth cup of coffee . The cook in the rear rattled his pans . But Jason forgot to pay his gas bill , his quarters were cold . He sat in his overcoat and hammered out his stuff on the typewriter . And now those letters , those small pink envelopes post-marked Philadelphia came to a stop , the Jolly Postman did not bring any more to the tenement . Jason waited and waited , but none came . Whenever his friend Leon came over , the ex-poet turned the conversationtoward a certain point . " I 'm getting tired of this town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a few days , the change will do me good . " And Leon , going through his own wilderness , gettingp110up stiff and dry-eyed after tossing about in feverish dreams all night , said a few words to his friend to show he was really interested . " Where 'll you go ? " " I do n't know , maybe a bus ride , maybe Philadelphia , it does n't cost much and it does n't take long , you know . " " Yes , it 's only about a hundred miles , " said Leon vaguely , thinking about something else , wondering . Aye , December , a chilly , gloomy month . In the square the bronze statues discolored more , taking on a greenish tint . The show running at the Acme was now CRIME AND PUNISHMENT , a throbbing drama by Feodor Dostoievsky , rendered by the Moscow Art Players , matinees still 15c , evenings 30c . At Webster Hall " The Girls From Sweden " ran a dance , a Swedish ball , stamping , whirling , dancing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pauses a fellow with a Finnish accordion jumped upon the platform and pressed out a tune , a sea-chanty , and all heels hit the floor ; the fellow worked and sweated at the song . The African doorman , gold braid all over his cap , upon his shoulders , and heavy against his chest , spoke in conferencewith a cab driver at the curb . " Brother , " he said , " a lot of poor folks is dancin ' tonight , just trash , no business in sight as far as I kin see . Them is workin ' people there , the tips at the checkroom has been lousy from what I gather after looking over the situation . " The cab driver stared straight ahead , his gaze hard up Eleventh Street . Behind him a file of cabs , not so long tonight , waited for fares . Couples came out , but walked the few blocks toward the subways , business was plenty bad . Cold air hurried on , no stars were out , no moon . In the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little booze across the counter , business was so rotten by him too ; he stood in the rear of the deserted store , surveying the empty tables with a gloomy eye , noting lonely-looking salt-and-pepper shakers , old canebottomedchairs , and his face took on a hang-dog , beaten look . Over the fire was cooking , slowly , some goulash , the smell hung heavy above the stove . In the second week of December Jason sent two letters off to Philadelphia , waiting four days before he sent the second . No answer came . A few days later , when Leon came upstairs to see his friend , Jason was stretched out upon the cot , his eyes bright , thin lines etched across his forehead . The ex-poet pulled the left sleeve of his shirt down hurriedly . " Is that a rash you 've got there ? " asked Leon , quick of eye , quick of mind , before the sleeve was pulled down all the way ; and just before he left , when Jason was n't looking , he took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only two dollars and ten cents . Miss Allen , that young nurse Jason had met a few times since he had paid a visit to the hospital , sent him a card again , asking him to call , and when he called , why , there she was , all dressed in her street clothes , standing modestly in the doorway waiting for him . She took his arm and they started walking up the street and , glancing from the cornersof her eyes , scanned him closely . In a doorway of a large furniture store on Fourteenth Street she felt his pulse , glancing at her wristwatch . " What have you been doing , your pulse is so fast , what have you been doing ? " she asked . He stared out upon the street with old-man , empty eyes and then looked deadly at her , blankly is the word . They walked up Fifth Avenue , going north towardp112Twenty-Third Street . Big buses hurried by , hugging the curb , passengers on top and bottom , the heavy autos farting light blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the citizenry stepped across . " You forgot to call me at the hospital last Monday as you promised , " said Miss Allen , said the young nurse who was now fighting for a losing cause . Jason walked on , no brightness in his eyes . The second door south had a brown door . . . . In the cold he fished out a smoke and lit the cigarette like an expert , puffing at it like a hungry man . The young nurse from upstate looked the other way , he was so worn and thin . She took his arm when they reached the corner and , as the ex-poet looked sharply toward the right to see if traffic was approaching , he saw that her eyes were wet . He inhaled a great draft then . At Twenty-Third Street they turned back , walking slowly . The wind shifted , driving in from the east . They stopped in front of the hospital entrance . Jason was now shivering , trying to hide it . Then he said something , said a few words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for everything . He stared up the street as he spoke . " I would have taken you to a show , " he said , " but I 'm broke . " He kept staring up the street , frowning , as if something interested him there . He took his glasses off and shined them slowly . Miss Allen bit her lip , her eyes were going wet again . She gave his arm a squeeze . When he had walked a half a block she was still standing near the entrance , watching him strolling up thestreet . He had narrow shoulders and looked so boyish fromthe rear . The sole of his left shoe slapped the pavementgently at each step , cold air blew in upon his socked foot . A few days later the mailman brought Jason a package ,  |p113a  pair of shoes . They were a trifle too wide for him . No note was inside , nothing at all . Jason put them on and beganwearing them . The old ones he tossed out the window , dropping them down upon the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason , who heard his footsteps , had his feet hoisted upon his typewriter table , so that the little fellow could see the brown , sturdy shoes he now had on . " Where did you get them ? " Leon asked , wondering if his friend had received another check . Jason took his time about answering , he was even a bit arrogant about it . Leon had to ask again . " Where ? " said Jason . " Why , I bought them in one of the swankiest dumps on Fifth Avenue , " and he gave the name of the store . " The pair set me back fourteen dollars , but they 're worth it . I 'm careful about my feet . " He sat there gazing at the staunchness of the shoes ; they had wide toes and would wear well  --  English shoes perhaps . He stared so fondly and so long that he did not noticethat Leon stood there smiling . " Well , what are you grinning at , do n't you believe me ? " Jason said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Leon stood there , still smiling . From his large , dark eyes there flowed the warmth of his generous nature . " I was smiling at something else , " he said . " Here you sit in the cold , when you have a gas-heater in the room . Why do n't you light it ? " Jason glared at him . Was the little fellow making sportof him , was the worm turning ? " I 'll not answer to that , " the ex-poet replied . " Besides , the room is warm enough . " " Is it ? " Leon opened his mouth and blew vapor forth , gray steam . Then , still smiling , he crossed the room , struck a match , and bent down in front of the little gas- heater . Jason grew hot around the collar , this was going a bit too far . Did n't the little fellow know very well that the gas was shut off , the bill was n't paid ? He cleared his throat and glared hard at Leon 's bent-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the gas flowed brightly , burning evenly . The room became filled with glowing heat . Leon turned about , holding the blackened match in his hand . He stood there smiling , waiting for Jason to say something . The ex-poet sat there frowning a long while . " Oh , yes , " he said at last , matter-of-fact , not yielding an inch , " I was going to light the burner just before you came in , but I was all out of matches . " TOWARD the middle of December Mr. Boardman , the gray-haired , gray-mustached man who lived with the trim young woman across the hall from the " Russian " couple , began to look more worried about the eyes than ever . Even the old janitress of Twenty-Door City noticed it . Every evening she saw him leading Dodo by a leash , taking the dog for a short walk up the street , then back again . He was a fine-looking gentleman , he had an air of breeding , and his clothes fitted him well , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was troubling him . Then she thought about hanging out a sign for that little room across the hall from Mister Wheeler , the one that had been vacant for over a year now ; the agent of the tenementhad said something about it . Every day the Jolly Postman came up the street , makinghis rounds , walking in his wide , roomy shoes , but hep115did not always bring jolly good news . He brought Mr. Boardman the news that his sixteen-year-old daughter who was studying in a Massachusetts finishing school would like to come to New York for the Christmas holidaysto visit her papa . She wrote the letter in her girlish , virginal hand , signing her name with a girlish swirl at the end , like a mousie 's tail : Milly , the signature was , with a curly swirl at the end of it . The postman plodded up the street with his load upon his back , stuck the daughter 's envelope into the Boardman mail-box and went his way , recalling that sturdy epic dear to the hearts of all mail-carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds . . . . " This legend , carved over the wide staircase of Indiana limestoneof the main Post Office was duplicated in a modest cardboard sign which reposed inside the door of the employees ' lavatory of Station " D " over on Thirteenth Street . Mr. Boardman , home from the office , waiting for Margie to finish dressing before they went out for the evening , wondered what he 'd do about the matter . He had n't seen his daughter for over a year now and , though he wanted her with him during the holidays , he knew it could n't be done  --  it was n't " practical . " He held his hat in his hand , walked the room slowly , waiting for Margie to finish dressing . She was in the bathroom , and through the half-opened door he heard her humming to herself , in that low , throaty voice of hers , that sad , vigorous way she had of humming the blues . He caught some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you spank your little Ma-ma now . . . ? " " Ready ? " he said when she clicked the light out there.  | " Nope , " she answered , turning brightly , giving his cheek a playful tap . He placed his hat down and hooked her dress from the back for her . She had doused plenty of expensive scent on her clothing tonight , the flat smelled like a florist 's shop . " Where we going , daddy ? " " Anywhere you like , " he answered quietly , picking up his hat again , reaching for his cane . He helped her with her coat , the new one he had given her as a gift only a month ago . It had a fine fur collar . " There 's a new place just opened up last week , " she told him . " Over on Fifty-Fourth Street , they say it 's a real joint . " " All right , we can go there , " Mr. Boardman said and clicked the living-room light out . She kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on her toes , pursing her lips baby-fashion . He closed the door quietly , they walked down the stairs . When they reached the street , they stood looking up and down until a cab came along . In the taxi she sat playing idly with his fingers , acting very happy and glad to be with him . The hum of rubber tires against the pavement , the feel of her cool fingers toyingwith his , lulled his brain . They got off in front of an old-fashioned brownstone front , he paid the driver , and the cab rolled off . Early evening traffic went up the street , a few people walked by . At the corner a drugstore sign flashed on and off : Venida Hair-Nets , Soda &; Prescriptions . At last they were inside , after Mr. Boardman had done a little smooth , quiet talking through an opened panel of the thick front door . To clinch the argument he showed a few cards from other speakeasies . The heavy door swung back.  |p117Small  round tables lined the walls , middle-aged waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the kitchen . The conversation of the guests was lowpitchedand refined , this was no noisy joint . Most of the women , smartly dressed , were no longer young , and their male escorts were well on in years themselves . The place  --  1 had an air of class . The head waiter gave Margie and Mr. Boardman a table to the left . The food was warm and good , they took their time . The drinks were all right too , everything was fine . Sitting back , turning his fine gray head , Mr. Boardmansurveyed the scene , allowing his glance to wander here and there . A few women looked his way , he was quite attractive . Margie , after the soup , wiped her lips with her napkin and carefully rouged her mouth ; she took out a new stick and tore the cap off with her fingernails and afterwards , when the entertainment began , Mr. Boardmansaw how her mouth flamed , it looked like a dexterous smear of blood . Three girls came out in tights to warble a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in unison , each face the same , mouths forming the same voweled words , heels tapping the floor , powdered thighs quivering slightly as they tapped . They were the Harmony Sisters , God 's giftlito Broadway . The guests gave the girls a warm hand , the kids had it coming to them . Afterwards a master of ceremonies , a tap-dancing lad who tried hard to break his neck , stepped out upon the floor in an encore number and , with two small green spotlights playing on his face , lifted a small megaphone to his mouth and sang a sad , sad love song . Mr. Boardman , thinking of his sixteen-year-old daughter and how he could get out of seeing her during the Christmas holidays , wondered why all the songs hadp118to be so sad . Turning his head , he saw Margie and a tall man three tables away looking at each other . He lit another cigarette and stared down at the gold-plated matchbox . Margie tapped his wrist quickly across the little table . " I saw you watching , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it just to make you jealous , you daddy-daddy . " " I was looking the other way , " Mr. Boardman answered . " I did n't notice . " They had a few more drinks , it was nice and quiet here , not like the other noisy places . Still , the prices were rather steep , you paid plenty for it . Mr. Boardman paid . They went out , the head waiter bowing in the French tradition ; he was a gent who had taken in a few continental movies and knew just how the farewell was executed . Outside the air was cold again . Margie turned her fur collar up , giving her rear a more aristocratic look . At the corner the drugstore sign still flashed on and off : Venida Hair-Nets . Mr. Boardman did n't stop to read it all , it was not important enough . In the cab , riding home , he spoke to Margie about his sixteen-year-old daughter , how his daughter wanted to see him during the coming holidays . The taxi hurried up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's neck . There was a small pimple there . Mr. Boardman told Margie that , if his daughter really wanted to come to New York , why he might have to stop at a hotel for a few days ; he might have to stop there alone . " I could tell my daughter the decorators are repainting the apartment , or that I moved . It would be perfectly easy to explain it that way . " " But what about me , daddy , what am I to do when you 're gone , when you 're living at the hotel ? "  | " My daughter will stay for only a few days , a week at the most , that 's all . After that it will be the same again , " Mr. Boardman explained . " But I 'll be all by my lonesome , " Margie answered poutingly , toying b with his fingers , thinking of the tall man who sat three tables away , thinking of any tall man who was fairly handy . " I 'll be all alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear . " She continued to toy with his fingers as the cab sped on , humming over the pavement . " It wo n't be for long , " he repeated , listening to the steady drone of the rubber tires as the taxi hurried them back to the Glen Cove Apartments , wondering vaguely how it would all end . " I do n't know what I 'll do , " murmured Margie sadly , still thinking of a tall man , still playing with Boardie 's fingers . Mr. Boardman , his stare fixed upon the pimple on the neck of the driver in the seat ahead , tried to reassure her all during the ride . His words were clearly spoken , but had a dead ring to them . FOR SOME WEEKS now Celia had been saving her pocket money , putting the small change into a narrow tin box in the upper left-hand drawer of her dresser . There were mostly dimes and quarters in the box , but as the days passed a small pile began accumulating . Every evening she read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering what dental parlor did the best work at the lowest price . In the rocker , erect and quietly stern , her aunt held a travel book about the Orient in her hand . Mrs. Chapman was very much interested in India lately because she had received , two months or so ago , a letter from a friend up in Boston who had a brother-in -- law who was a missionary near Bombay . The light above the table shone upon Celia 's black coiled hair . Her chin cupped in her hands , her eyes lifting to stare vacantly at the faded flowers of the wallpaper , she wondered why Leon had that bright , hurried look in his eyes lately and why he passed her on the stairs with only a brief word or two . Only today she had reminded him , as he was rushing out , that she was ready to pose for those five-minute pencil sketches he had talked to her about a few weeks ago , but at her words he had stood stock-still for a long time , before he remembered just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he had finally said , coloring slightly , " I 'm working on a new canvas now . As soon as I 'm finished , I 'd be glad to have you pose for me . " She stood there until the door banged . But when she cleaned his room , she looked about and saw no work in progress , only a roll of canvas in a corner , a few wooden stretchers , and a few hazy pencil studies of people walking past Union Square . She started cleaning his room very vigorously , working hard at it , doing a thoroughjob because she knew he liked his quarters neat and clean . But just before she finished , her chin trembled and she had to sit down in a chair and blow her nose softly . She sat there staring at the wall , her hair in the old house-cap , the broom in her girlish hands . Later on , in the afternoon , she bought a red flower from a peddler going up Third Avenue , spending a dime from her hoarded pocket money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a glass of clear water on his dresser . He felt a little funny around the throat as he stood there looking at it . The next evening , as he was going out for supper , he walked quietly back behind the first floor staircase and knocked softly on Celia 's door . When she opened it , her face flamed . Leon stood there ill at ease . " Thanks for the flower , " he said , pitching his voice low . " Thanks , it was nice of you . " " I happened to find it , " she said , one hand trembling on the knob . " It was n't anything . " " Well , thanks just the same . " He stood there , his throat harsh and hot like a wooden plank under a summer sun . " I was going for a walk later in the evening , I 'm going out to eat now , and I thought , if you had nothing to do , you might care to walk with me . " He had finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and slight as she . And Celia ? Her heart was throbbing , her fingers clutched the doorknob . Go with him ? What would her aunt say to that , going walking with a roomer ? She had never gone out with a young man yet , she was only eighteen , and of course she did not attend dance halls or go walking alone along Fourteenth Street looking back over her shoulder . " I do n't know . . . " she said . " My aunt  --  you see . . . " But he was standing there . They heard someone walking on the stairs a few floors above . " All right , " she said hurriedly . " Knock twice at my door at eight o'clock , I 'll be ready . " At eight o'clock the stars were shining over Fourteenth Street , shining in a dark December sky . On the corner of Third Avenue the vender selling Turkish halvah stared with his small , greenish eyes at the passing throng , thenp122barked a low , sad bark , urging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut , five cents a cut . Mister , missus , five cents a cut . . . " A small knot of men stood at the curb , listening to the jazzy music coming from the Diana Gardens . Two gents from the lower Bowery stopped to listen , too . The Diana Gardens were on the second floor and they could see dim blue lights , Chinese lanterns , and streamers . A big sign stared : DANCING IS A SOCIAL NECessity . The sign was n't long enough , the printer did the best he could . At eight o'clock ( chimes ringing all around the square ) Leon walked down from his room , that funny feeling at his throat again , and knocked twice upon little Celia 's door . She stood there waiting , all dressed up already . They went out the building quickly . " It 's not cold tonight , " said Leon , after they covered the first block . Cold ? No , it was n't . Celia had read the weather forecast , it would be fair and pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight and tomorrow with fresh southwest winds shifting to southeast . On the seaboard moderate to light north to northeast winds from below Hatteras to Block Island would blow , driving in north or northwest from Nantucket to Halifax or Sable Island . " I suppose your aunt was surprised when you told her you were going walking , " said Leon , taking her arm at the corner . Celia stared straight ahead . She had feigned a headacheonly a half-hour ago and had told her aunt she was going straight to bed . " Why should my aunt be surprised ? " she said , quietly , firmly , her small mouth taking on a determined look . Leon coughed gently.  | " I do n't know , " he said . They neared Second Avenue and Seventeenth Street and entered the small park there . A tall black iron fence was around it , old-fashioned ironwork . " Well , " said Leon as they started walking up a desertedpath , " no one seems to be around . " He laughed a little . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her heart pounding at her words . Leon laughed again . He stuck his hands in his overcoat pockets and whistled a few bars of a tune . " I once studied the violin , " he said , " when I was very young . " They walked all around the little park three times , goingup every path . The night was rather springish , no chill in the air , and when Leon spied a newspaper on the ground he picked it up and asked Celia if she would like to sit on a bench for a while . " If it 's too cold , why of course we do n't have to sit down , " he said . Celia sat down , spreading the paper for him , too . There was plenty for both , she said . She put her hands in her pockets , to keep them warm . Pretty soon Leon was talking . The fine night , this young girl at his side , his afternoons with Comrade Helen  --  all fused , and the darkness of the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told Celia he was a communist . A communist ? What was that ? She had heard and read about some demonstrations and how the police had dispersedparaders several times  --  but communists , what were they ? She sat there puzzled . Leon told her all about the movement . She was no sneer/ing audience such as Jason , she sat watching his face as she spoke . Down the path a little arc lamp stood casting light their way . The light fell upon his brow , the air stirred his hair , he brushed back a lock as he started talking . He told her all about the brotherhood of the movement , how labor produced all wealth , therefore all wealth should go to labor , how women were at last to have equal rights in the new scheme of things . He also spoke about Russia . Now he was going strong , talking quietly , earnestly , his words and thoughts tumbling from him as he spoke . All of his own dreams , his half-formed ideals and ideas took shape now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had the right word for everything , he linked his sentences perfectly . Celia , sitting small and quiet as a squirrel , listened . The wind shifted from east to northeast . Leon spoke for a long time , maybe a good half hour or so . Finally he saw she was chilly , she was even shivering a bit . He asked her if she were cold . She said , " No . " But he saw she was lying . He himself felt very warm now , he stared up the path . Finally he said : " Come on , let 's walk , I 'll talk you to sleep pretty soon . " He laughed . So they rose from the bench and took a few more turns about the little park . In a dark spot they saw a sailor kissinga girl ; the sailor had the girl backed up against a tree . Leon and Celia walked faster , staring ahead and only when they were out of the park and passing street lights did they talk to each other again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Leon became aware that in the park his words of fire had been meant for someone else . This girl was walking with him at his side while in his brain another face was printed . Celia tried to rouse him , she attempted to discuss what hep125had just spoken to her in the park , and Leon tried to respond . He listened to her faltering , disconnected sentences ( he saw at once she had failed to grasp a single Marxist statement he had made on the bench ) and called himself a fool . Now he knew for sure that all the glowing thoughts had flowed from the furnace of his mind toward someone else all evening . He answered lamely and they walked in silence toward the rooming house . Finally Celia , sensing his mood , stopped talking , stopped trying to say something that might please him , and walked at his side as silent as he , her little heels rappingagainst the sidewalk . They passed Fifteenth Street before they knew it , came up to Fourteenth , and , obeying a whim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes who was barking a low , sad bark . He bought a tencentcut of Turkish halvah . The old gent put it into a bigger bag . " Here , " said Leon , holding out the bag to Celia . " Take some . " She reached into the sack and broke off a piece . The stuff was rich and oily , heavy . " This is supposed to be Turkish stuff , " said Leon , wipinghis fingers , chewing . The first mouthful was all right , the rest tasted like straw . Above their heads a jazzband blared , they lifted their eyes and saw the opened windows . DANCING IS A SOCIAL NECeSSity . They strolled on , Leonholding the paper bag . The stars were still shining above Fourteenth Street , shining in a dark December sky . At the curb a few venders had their wares spread out , three pairs of gen-u-ine silk socks for a quarteh , you can not go wrong , Japanese jumping toys for the kiddies at home and a razor-blade sharpener for a dime . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Block Islandp126and continued to blow in that direction . At half-past ten Celia , who liked walking along Fourteenth Street with Leon , suggested that they go home , her aunt might be worrying , she said . They retraced their steps , walking toward the east again . Leon opened the front door with his key . Celia walked quickly back behind the staircase and did n't stop to talk to Leon very long ; in fact , she was a bit short with him . " Thanks very much , " she whispered , one hand on the knob , her ears listening for footsteps . Leon stood there smiling at her . Thanks ? " What for ? " he said . " Well , I enjoyed it , " she answered quickly , listening for footsteps , tightening her grip on the doorknob . " I mean your talking and the walk . I enjoyed it very much , Leon , you know that . " His smile grew warmer and he said he had enjoyed it , too . Then she closed the door . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself tightly . She took her clothes off and lay in bed with the light on for a long time , so that she could jump up and see herself in the mirror often . The flat , oily taste of the halvah was still in her mouth , no , she was n't dreaming . She clicked the light off at last and snuggled into bed . THE CONSOLIDATED WAREHOUSE down on LafayetteStreet was so busy with the Christmas rush , there was so much stuff coming in and going out of the huge building that Hank Austin stopped worrying about thep127foreman 's warning or the stare that Old Running Water had once cast his way . All the boys worked overtime up to the nineteenth of the month , the hours piled up . When he got paid off on the nineteenth , which was a Saturday , Hank felt so good he stopped into Hearn 's on Fourteenth Street and bought his youngest kid a colored rattle for a quarter . Afterwards he walked along FourteenthStreet , shouldering his way through the crowds , looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday  --  wreaths in the windows , cotton and false snow decorations to make the displays look wintry , cranberries and mistletoe ; and in the window of the small Hungarian restaurant ( Hank is now plowing up Eleventh Street ) there hung , in sad dejection , a shabby rope of high-grade garlic . Hank Austin went home , into the hallway , clumping up the historic stairs of Twenty-Door City , swung his apartment door open and , as his kids ran growling at his legs , why , he dragged them across the floor like so much seaweed . Then he dug into his pocket , bent over the eightmonths-oldinfant ( time has passed ) , shook the rattle , and teased the kid as a chubby Austin fist stretched out for it . In the end he placed the toy in the baby 's hand , smiled a while down at his heir who was fourth in line , then took his hat and leather jacket off . He washed up , pulled a chair toward the kitchen table , and when the kids were n't lookingnipped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , her eyeballs rolling , giving him his soup . He scowled down at it , lifted up a spoonful , blew upon it and swallowed it down . Good stuff . All the kids ate , aping the old man , holding their spoons in their fists with a full , tight grasp , shoving the food down . " I made eighteen hours extra this week , " said Hank ,  |p126and  continued to blow in that direction . At half-past ten Celia , who liked walking along Fourteenth Street with Leon , suggested that they go home , her aunt might be worrying , she said . They retraced their steps , walking toward the east again . Leon opened the front door with his key . Celia walked quickly back behind the staircase and did n't stop to talk to Leon very long ; in fact , she was a bit short with him . " Thanks very much , " she whispered , one hand on the knob , her ears listening for footsteps . Leon stood there smiling at her . Thanks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I enjoyed it , " she answered quickly , listening for footsteps , tightening her grip on the doorknob . " I mean your talking and the walk . I enjoyed it very much , Leon , you know that . " His smile grew warmer and he said he had enjoyed it , too . Then she closed the door . She got inside , trembling all over , hugging the evening to herself tightly . She took her clothes off and lay in bed with the light on for a long time , so that she could jump up and see herself in the mirror often . The flat , oily taste of the halvah was still in her mouth , no , she was n't dreaming . She clicked the light off at last and snuggled into bed . THE CONSOLIDATED WAREHOUSE down on LafayetteStreet was so busy with the Christmas rush , there was so much stuff coming in and going out of the huge building that Hank Austin stopped worrying about thep129a toothpick and stared at the long , light brown hairs that grew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water had been a blond in his youth . At five-thirty the boys checked out , punching the clock  --  eleven husky men with caps pulled over their loyal skulls . Hank checked out the last , he had plenty of time , he was in no special hurry , he never got a seat on the subwayanyway . As he placed his card into the OUT rack on the left-hand side of the clock , he caught sight of the foremanstanding in the office door , saw the foreman staring into space . The man was still chewing on a toothpick and , as Hank headed for the stairway , the foreman 's eyes swung round , staring at the broad , leathered back that swung along . A draft blew in as the door was opened , but was cut short when the iron latch clicked into place again . And that night , that chill December night , when Bill ( he was another truckman working for the Consolidated ) came over to Hank Austin 's place , paying a social call , the atmosphere was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dots after four hustlers ' names . They sat in the kitchen ( the other two rooms were used as bedrooms ) and in a loyal , American fashion discussed loyal , American topics . Their good wives sat and listened ; Bill 's dame was hefty , too , only not so short as Hank 's mssus . " Take Hoover , for instance , " said Hank , clearing his throat , " take Hoover , now he 's doing the best he can , no man can say he ai n't . Take Hoover , for instance . . . " And Bill nods , nods that loyal skull of his . The two wives nod also , the kids sitting around with their elbows on the edge of the big kitchen table nod too , nodding from fatigue . At nine o'clock Missus Austin , wearing her green Sunday-and-company dress ( which is a bit tight under the armpits , but it 's too late now , she ca n't change it )  --   | Missus Austin packed her young ones off  --  but first they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key in their childish fists , one after the other . Then the grown folks sat alone , two pairs of them , the men hustlers , the women housewives . Now Bill was talking , he had a word or two to say . " Take the Government , for instance , " he said , frowningas he grappled for the right words , " take the Government , for instance , they 're doing the best they can , you ca n't say that they ai n't . But things are tough , it 's a bad year , we got to be patient . Take the Government , for instance . . . " And Hank nods , nods that loyal skull of his . His missus nods also , Bill 's wife nods too , all of them nod as the speaker has his say . At nine-thirty , the political situation cleared off the decks , they sat around and had a playful game of rummy , no stakes , no hard feelings , just a round or two . Years ago , right after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife , when factories were hummingand the sky was the limit , Hank and his missus had played for stakes , Hank puffing on a perfecto , wearing a fifteen-dollar silk shirt with broad zebra stripes . But now he sat playing for the fun of it , it was better that way anyhow , no hard feelings , no arguments . Bill , who thought along the same lines , who had made plenty of jack in the good old post-war days , shuffled the deck and flipped the cards around . He was a big man , going just a bit beefy around the hips , and he had a bald spot on the top of his crown . When that spot had first appeared his good wife had kissed it in fun , now she slapped it every week or so and teased him that he was getting on in years . Missus Austin , looking classy in her tight green dress ( " Christ , she 's got a build as solid as a rock , " thought Bill ) , made coffee after a while and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were not hard drinkers , that is , er , drinkers of , er , hard stuff , so the coffee had to do . Four bottles of nice cold beer would have gone over big , but then , er , beer cost something and , er , the Austins had a lot of mouths to feed . The cookies and the coffee were all right , big cups of strong coffee  --  that 's the way . " Take the unions , for instance , " says Hank , scowling at a cookie held in that big fist of his , " take the unions . Now some of them are pretty strict to get into , but as a whole most of them are doing the best they can . Times are tough , you ca n't get away from that . But by spring things should get better , that 's what the papers say . . . . " " What about the commoonists ? " Bill 's good wife asks , sticking her hand into the fire . " They go around making trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Communists ? That meant foreigners ; and instantly Hank 's thoughts swung sharply toward the family across the hall , a den of Italians , co-sharers of the third front toilet , they ought to go back where they came from , and he remembered that banging toilet door . " Commoonists ? " he said , aping her pronunciation , shoving his underlip out . " They 're foreigners , they ought to go back where they come from . This country should be for Amerikins . " And his powerful jaws crushed the chainstorecakes into a powder . " Take the commoonists , " says Bill agreeing , also gettingworked up . " Now that 's another matter . Take the commoonists . . . " and he shot off his gab , spilling out all he had to say in sixteen words . Now Bill 's wife was sorry she had started things , thep132men were going at it like hammer and tongs . Missus Austin , reaching carefully across for another cookie , so as not to put too much strain upon the cloth under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would talk about the weather . " They say that in Russia a wife can dee-vorce a husband in fifteen minutes , " Bill 's wife put in , adding spice to the boiling broth . Now Missus Austin grew curious , she was a woman and naturally was interested in the feminine movement all over the world . " All a woman has to do , " went on Bill 's wife , " is to go up to some kind of an office and fill out a sheet . . . " and she told them all about it . " I seen it in last Tuesday 's paper . . . " When she was finished , her husband looked at the whole thing from a man 's viewpoint , from an American 's standpoint . " What about the kids ? " " Oh , the kids . . . " his wife grunted . " I do n't know about that . . . " " Now take Russia , " Bill said , barking his words out , a small vein beating in his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right there , but over here it 's different . Over here it 's . . . " But now both women were nodding and he found himselftalking to only Hank . Hank , his empty stare fixed upon the rim of the coffee cup , sat as if listening , but his thoughts were very far away , far away to that evening when the foreman had dropped a word into the slot of his brain . " Now , take Russia , " Bill was saying , whipping himself up , scowling at the ten-cent sugar bowl , at the taut silk under Missus Austin 's armpits , " take Russia . . . "  |p133He  was still taking that great , wide sprawling country when the chimes of Grace Church struck eleven strokes , tolling eleven times in their classic , tolling manner . WHEN THE ELEVENTH CHIME died away , meltinginto the frosty , East Side night , Officer Terence McGuffy came on for duty , swinging his nightstick as he came . He glanced across the square , looking toward the north , and saw , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining in the dark December night . To the west was the Amalgamated , to the east the Union Square Savings Bank , and to the south was the gigantic Wrigley sign , which of course towered above all . McGuffy , surveying the scene , looking over his territory with the eye of a king 's lancer , swung his nightstick again , and sauntered across the street . Autos slowed down as they approached him . For a few minutes he stood talking to Officer Frank Ha j ek , another stalwart cop with a face like a hunk of juicy beef fresh from the butcher 's ice-box , only Ha j ek was n't a Celt , he was a Lithuanian and had high , grinning cheek-bones  --  a sturdy lad . He had once been a truck driver 's assistant , but that was a long time ago , maybe three years back or so . " How are things , colonel ? " inquired Officer McGuffy , swinging his club as he came , wiggling it behind his broad Irish back , making circles in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer , and the big , whiteglovedmitt of Officer Hajek lifted slowly in a gesture of regal authority . The east-west traffic spurted and started to flow by , trolleys bumping over the tracks , autos hummingalong . The two fellow officers stood a while together , discussing current topics in the current manner . By glancing across the chilly square McGuffy had a good view and could spot a sergeant all the way to Seventeenth Street , but , of course , no inspectors went cruising about as late in the evening as this . Still , you could never tell ; he swung his glance about , like a stalwart lancer in the king 's service . " I hear Kelly got taken on the carpet today , " said Officer McGuffy as the traffic flowed smoothly by , as a wind sprang up in the square . " Kelly , Mike Kelly ? " and Hajek 's palm rose slowly up again , giving the north-south traffic a chance to get going . " He was caught boozed up in Joe 's basement joint over on Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back again . " Oh , " said Hajek , motioning at a slow moving car , " I thought it was something serious . " There was no more news then , nothing further to talk about . From the car tracks where they stood the decorated shop windows looked bright and cheerful . The cotton really looked like snow from the distance . " Only a few more days left , " said McGuffy , thinking of Christmas . " Hey ! " hollered Hajek and started bawling hell out of a driver who had attempted to make a left turn against the lights . Officer Ha j ek , walking over , stuck his jaw out , narrowed his left eye a little , put one foot on the running board and started his sarcastic faucet running , a wideopentap . He shoved his head inside the automobile . " Arep135ya color-blind ? " he asked , talking loudly , getting a harsh ring to his words . " Can'tcha see the red light , are ya wearin ' smoked glasses , buddy ? " The driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stream of cars behind honking and squawking for a clear road , looked funny about the gills . " Here , pull over , pull over , " commanded Hajek . The car pulled over , there was a girl inside . With short toots and backward looks , the drivers of the other autos started passing . " I ought to run you in , " said Hajek , shoving his head inside the car again , right near the speedometer light , highlights shining on his grinning cheek-bones . " The least I can do is to give you a ticket . Yah . " But he made no move , did not take his white gloves off . Out on the street , centered between the sets of car tracks , Officer Terence McGuffy was at the helm , directing traffic in his comrade 's absence , while his fellow officer faithfully discharged his duty . The rule-book said ( this in bold-face type ) , " Co-operation between fellow officers in the line of duty is but one of the many rules the policeman must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on , he gave the lad at the wheel no ticket even ; he had a good cop 's heart after all . Besides , the young girl sitting next to the driver was a good-looker , lifting and crossing her left leg as Hajek bawled out the meek young man . She stared wistfullyat the big cop , and he saw she had a well-turned calf . " I ought to run you in , " says Hajek , righteousness in his heart but forgiveness in his roving eyeballs . He looked less stern . " I ought to run you in , " he said . A pause . " Well , get going , get a move on , what are ya waiting for ? " The driver , looking grateful said : " Thanks , officer , " and shifted gears . The girl smiled toward him and as her friend shifted into second uncrossed her leg . " The public ! " Hajek said , coming back to McGuffy . " Sure , sometimes they get your goat , " McGuffy said . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he started strolling northward around the square . He took his time . When he made the rounds of the south side he crossed over to Fourteenth Street and paused a while to scan the reading matter and photos in front of the Acme Theater . Another Russian picture was playing , this time , THE OLD AND THE NEW , the great epic of mother Russia 's struggle for growth . The billboards were covered with pictures of tractors , stacked wheat , smiling workers , and scythes against the sky . McGuffy , swinging his club behind his back , wiggling it playfully like a doggie 's tail , looked the photos over , posting himself thoroughly on the Russian situation . When he crossed over to talk to Officer Hajek , he cleared his throat and , of course , had to boast a bit about his knowledge , and you could n't blame him . " Those Russians , " he said , and gave his comrade the lowdown on the whole Soviet system . " Dumping goods , having a big army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now take those Russians . . . " He told Comrade Hajek all about it . A few blocks southeast another speaker was going strong , haranguing a workers ' audience  --  none other than Comrade Irving Rosenblum speaking on the subject of trade unionism , telling the lads how to go about organizing . " Now in Russia , " he said , warming up , putting shrapnel in his eyes , " take Russia , for instance . . . " and he told the workers all about it . Aye , they were all talking Russia somewhere on that dark , December night . Stars shone in the sky . The wholep137East Side was growing Russia-conscious , what with the Acme Theater , the comrades selling the Daily Worker , The Moscow News , and other Russianized sheets . Right near the corner a store had recently opened up , selling objets d'art from the Soviet Republics : blouses , baste shoes , candlesticks , jugs , dishes , and towels . People who came in to buy were mostly Greenwich Villagers , artylookingyoung couples who lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately swung over from free love to communism . Gray air hurried by , driving in from Sable Sound . In one of the pauses , when the radio announcer stopped to get his wind , you could hear a phonograph record tinklingaway , playing a merry metilitza . Over on Second Avenue the Russian cafes were jammed ; there was a swanky , uptown crowd filing into the Russian Art Cafe and even the Original Moskowitz ( half-Hungarian , halfRussian ) had a goodly throng , with the last tables near the smell of the kitchen filled up before the night was over . Balalaika music strummed away , the chefs opened many tins of caviar . " Here is a very fine Russian dish , " said the waiters , bending low over the guests , allowing their tunic sleeves to billow out . " In Moscow it is a favorite . . . . " The guests order , just a little bit of Russia , heigh-ho , see that man playing the balalaika , why he 's a Tartar , I 'll betcha , a real Caucasus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not rattle the pans . It is quiet here , subdued . At a quarter to twelve Mr. Quincy Boardman began packing his suitcase . He was leaving for the hotel and Margie , blowing her nose softly and looking sad and sorry , stood by watching. t " Oh , Boardie , Boardie darling , I 'll be all by my lonesome , I do n't know what I 'll do without you . " Mr. Boardman , carefully shaven and thinking of his sixteen-year-old daughter who was due at the railroad station early in the morning , said it was only for a short time , and went on packing . He placed his things into the grip with care , then locked the leather bag . At the door Margie clung to him . He went down the stairs quietly , hailed a cab at the street , and registered at a family hotel on a side street . In the flat across the hall the young " Russian " couple were making plans for Christmas Day . Vanya , his nose pressed to the glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow by then , if he would have a white Christmas , just like in northern Russia . He talked it over with Natasha , who was getting a little tired of acting Russian , but , of course , she could n't back out now because she had so many knickknacks and pieces of Russianfurniture in the flat . The air grew cold and raw outside . It blew into the hallwaynext door , through that shattered windowpane on the third floor , rattling the little ten-cent locks on the doors . But Hank was sleeping , he did not yell or holler out at all . On Thirteenth Street Mr. Nicholson , the cracked printer , got up from his bed after lying thinking for a long , long while . He was about to start on another volume and had been thinking up an opening sentence . Finally he had it . He jumped out of bed , threw the covers aside . There he stood , excited , his eyes glassy , standing in his bare feet , in his long , dirty suit of winter underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung along . He ran his eyes over the books in the shelves , Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and other standardp139works . Going over , he pulled a tome out , still thinking of a good first sentence , still hunting for an epic phrase . He thumbed the pages . Victories stared up at him , how the crashing phalanxes swept all before them , how homeward , on the seven hills of Rome , shout upon shout rang out upon return . Men  --  men were made to fight , men were made for war ! He thumbed another page . . . women coming rosy from the baths , slaves following , matrons walking full-bosomed past the marble columns . Women ? The left side of his face began to twitch . Women ? He knew what they were for . He strode over in his bare feet to the case of type , gripped a galley stick and started setting . Under the bright electric bulb his fingers flew on nervously . Southward , in the middle of the block on Eleventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late as it was , stood watching in his doorway and when he saw a big man in a cap come up , he opened the door and the man came inside . They closed the deal in fifty seconds . The Hungarian was going to sell booze , business was rotten , he had to live , there were mouths to feed . " I 'll be around Wednesday , " the big man said . " We 'll see how the stuff goes . " The door slammed , the Hungarian stood in the rear , feeling queasy on his pins for a while . Then he put out the lights and went home . A man 's got to live , there were mouths to feed . Far away , on the Jersey City side , a ferry boat shoved off for Manhattan , Skipper Jim Hawkins at the front rail . He was thinking about that item he had read in the papers lately , how folks had begun to hoard money and not take it to banks . Jim felt a bit bad about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar-box under his alarm clock in his Jersey City room . He was still thinking about it when the front of the ferry gently bumped the slip and settled snug against the wooden bulk of wharffront . On the return trip the wind began to rise a little , shiftingfrom north to northeast . It continued to blow that way , driving in from Halifax.  |p141CHRISTMAS  MORNING stole along Fourteenth Street like a gray wolf slinking into a dead prairie town at dawn . The sky was overcast , the damp wind sniffed at every lamp-post and deserted hallway . Just before the sky cracked open , it looked like rain  --  cold , pelting , lashing rain  --  but shortly after 4 a. m. the temperature began rising , some of the dark clouds hurried southward toward the harbor , and from then on the day was dull and gloomy . No Yuletide snow lay banked against the curb . In the Bowery missions the cooks rose early and started slicing potatoes , carrots , onions , and half-rotted turnips for the daily stew . To be up to snuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager ordered a couple of cans of green peas and sliced red beets to be opened , a little change in the menu , which he felt would go over great with the boys  --  and also with the board of trustees which was due to visit the place today . In the windows of all the stores along Fourteenth Street the MERRY CHRISTMAS signs still hung , their silvered letteringstaring out upon the street . Every church around the square began ringing out their bells . Some bonged , some clonged , others banged and clanged . Life must go on . The public must be kept informed . The presses roared , quiveringthe buildings . Trucks drew up and dropped their loads of papers at the newsstands , like trumpeting elephants dropping heavy pancakes on a jungle track . The early morning editions carried the customary Yuletide greetings from the customary people : bishops , cardinals , baseball managers down in Florida , movie stars , prize-fighters , heads of big department stores and steel mills , senators , real estate development promotors , and other stanch supportsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty coaches stand at the sidings , after delivering metropolitan passengersto the folks back home . Traffic pretty heavy , reportedthe manager of the eastern division . But we have taken care of the holiday rush very efficiently . In the city proper , long lines of pilgrims stood in front of gray cathedrals , waiting for the first mass to start . Inside , candles burned , plump priests walked up the main aisles , swinging heavy censers . A pale glow was spreading softly in the sky . Over the radio came early organ music , tones swelling , and a trained chorus joined in , hallelu j ahingmightily  --  strong , full-chested voices . In one of the East Side boarding houses , where some of the lodgers , subway track-walkers who worked on the early shift , had to get going before the day was fairly started , bacon and eggs sizzled merrily in Missus McCarthy 's pans . The municipal bath-house on East Eleventh Street was closed , no baths today , Antonia . So the little ten-year-old girl walked sadly homeward , hugging her towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the bells began ringing again , in greater and greater volume , rising in crescendo . The priest began chanting the first prayers , while the long file of pilgrims ,  |p143like  a soup-line on the Bowery , moved slowly forward , carefully climbing the cathedral stairs , passing the big , wide iron doors . The pews were shiny in the dim half-dark . Peals kept thundering out upon the town , rolling up the chill , gray streets . The tones died above the harbor , where a line of barges , towed by a couple of puffing tugs , drew by like a link of sausages pulled through mire by a pair of panting bulldogs . The skipper of the first tug , hearing the fading tones , leaned over the rail and spat thoughtfullyinto the mighty waters of the broad Atlantic . Then he stared toward the skyline of Hoboken and wondered how long it would take to get over there . Sniffing at the doorways , the cloudy morning slunk along , a gray wolf sneaking into town . AT EIGHT O'CLOCK Mr. Boardman rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirties , put his leather bedroom slippers on , and walked to the window to peer down upon the cloudy street below . In the next room ( he had taken two rooms with adjoining bath ) his sixteen-year-old daughter lay sleeping , her loosened , light brown hair lying in a soft mass above her pillowed head . Mr. Boardman , crossing over to stand in the doorway , stared upon her sleeping figure , saw her regular , even breathing ( one smooth , slim forearm exposed outside the quilt ) , stood there looking for a while , then went back to bed , where he lay under the covering , staring at the dull tone of the ceiling . He lay like that for a long time . When at last he heard his daughter stirring , he got out of bed , yawned loud enough so that she could hear , andp144called to her in a cheery , good-morning voice . " Up , Milly ? " he said , putting on his leather slippers . " Yes , papa , " came the answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring to it . He walked to the windows and lifted the shades , one by one . The morning outside was still gloomy . When he turned to speak to his daughter who was in the next room , he set his facial muscles self-consciously , setting them in a cordial , fatherly manner , and asked if she wanted to take a shower now , or later . " Or will you wait for me to take a shower , Milly ? " This made his daughter angry , in a playful way . Who did he think he was ( her voice playful , little bits of love for him hidden behind the chirping words )  --  who did he think he was , taking a bath before his daughter took hers , making her wait ? " I thought you were a gentleman , papa , I thought you believed in chivalry . " And her father made answer , a warm flow of feeling driving out the gloom in his bones . " I just asked you , Milly , I just wanted to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I 'm going to bathe now , " she answered sharply , and told him to close his door while she entered the shower . " I 'm not a little girl any longer , I 'm sixteen years old , so you 're not to look , " she said . And while she was getting ready , while she placed her bathrobe on the rack inside the shower-room , she kept talking crossly to her father , hiding little bits of love behind her words . Her talk came through the door , muffled by the stout wood of the hotel  --  girlish twittering . " Do you remember , papa , how you used to bathe me when I was small , right after mama went away ? Do you remember , papa , how I used to call you Pika then ? It was Pika this and Pika that , I sure made you hustle ,  |p145|pa|pa  . " Now she was doing up her hair , so that it would n't get wet . She spoke toward the door again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembered , suddenly , that his wife had been dead for eight years now . " You used to get soap in my eyes , " his daughter went on , her words coming through the door , " and one time my eyes smarted so much I cried all morning . Do you remember that , papa ? No , I suppose you would n't . " Mr. Boardman went to stand near the windows , where he could look down upon the street as his daughter 's words came to him . The gloom was going slowly from his bones , but something equally heavy was settling into place . " Thanks for answering my questions , " his daughter said . " I bet you 've taken out your watch to see how long I 'll be . Well , papa , you can stand there looking at it , because I 'm going to take my time about it . I have n't seen you for over a year now , so if I treat you badly you have yourself to blame . Do you hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you hear , Pika , do you hear ? " " I hear , Milly . " " Well , now I 'll start , I 've found a nice pink bar of new soap . It has such a nice smell , too . " Then he heard the'shower , the water hissing against the tiles . Setting his facial muscles again , working up the old feeling , he walked quietly to the bathroom door and knocked sharply . " Milly . " " What is it ? " Her voice was shrill , to rise above the spurting water . " Should I soap you up , can you do it yourself ? " he asked , mockingly . " I wo n't answer such a question , " she replied and wentp146on washing , loving her father more than ever . When he knocked again , she pretended not to hear him and did not answer . Afterwards he did not knock any more but went to stand near the windows again , his stare once more down upon the street below , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower stop . " I forgot the towel , " she cried sharply . " Papa , reach me a towel ! " He walked over to the sink and took a heavy towel from the rack above . She stuck a slim , smooth , dripping arm out the half-opened door while he handed her the towel . As he gave it to her , she turned her wrist cleverly and pinched him on the forearm . " That 's for being so mean as to want to shower first , " she said and banged the door shut . Five minutes later she called from her room , telling him he could now take his shower . She was sitting on her bed , dressing . She did up her hair in a soft , light brown pile and wondered if her father would feel bad if she applied lip rouge . She had never used it before  --  the authorities at the school forbade it  --  but at the station , coming to New York , she had bought a lipstick . While her father bathed , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her stockings on , rolling them tightly above the knee . She was a tall , slim girl , just beginning to blossom out . Sometimes Mr. Boardman had to shut off the shower to hear her . Finally he was finished , came out in his bathrobe , and began dressing . They continued to talk to each other , from room to room , the words coming through the opened doors of the shower . " Where are we going today , Pika ? Remember , it 's Christmas . We 've got to do something nice today . " " We 'll go anywhere you like , " he answered , knotting his necktie , looking at his face in the mirror . His stare wasp147too thoughtful , he reset his facial muscles again . " What would you like for breakfast , madame ? " he asked , a foil to her mood and manner . " The tongues of humming birds or just a glass of orange juice ? " " Bosh , " said Milly . " You know what an appetite I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still eat a hearty meal . " " All right , we 'll order a steak then . " A steak ? No , that was too heavy . " Remember how you used to cook my breakfast just before I went to grammar school , papa ? At first you always burnt the toast . Then we got Agnes , that fat Polish woman . She was a good cook , only her puddings were spiced too much . Remember her , papa ? " Mr. Boardman , looking at his face in the mirror , remembered . " I wonder where Agnes is now , papa . She was n't so old when she came to us , was she ? I do n't think she was sixty yet . But she was so fat , was n't she ? I remember she had no ankles hardly at all . " Later on , dressed and hungry , they went out to eat , going into a small , quiet place on Madison Avenue . The coffee was good , Milly ordered a second helping of wheatcakes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Once or twice she gently kicked her father 's foot under the table and asked him why he looked so sour . " Is n't the bacon good ? " she asked , looking at his eyes . He got a grip on himself and from then on she could find no fault with his manners . From then on , he was a cavalier , his manners were perfect , he said the proper phrase at the proper time and had her smiling and pleased with him . After breakfast they walked up Fifth Avenue for a few blocks and , hearing church bells , turned east on TwentyNinth.  | " Let 's go in , " the daughter said , and they went in . It was a small church , the congregation composed mostly of theatrical folk , and they took a bench in the rear . They sat through the service . The place was dim , cool to the eye , and restful . Toward the end the organ music , swelling , came out in a fine , rolling flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out into the air , they felt new and uplifted , and Mr. Boardman no longer had a worried look about the eyes . When a shabby man approached him he took out a dollar bill and gave it with a smile . The fellow lifted his hat and started to sputter his thanks . Milly , her eyes going misty , looked up at her father and held his arm tightly . Without speaking , walkingsilently together , they continued up Fifth Avenue . Occasionally Mr. Boardman tapped the sidewalk with the tip of his cane . Cars hummed by on the wide , smooth street . The air was still gray , but the weather was not so cold . It was pleasant to pass deserted shops , office buildings , windowdisplays , and see only Christmas strollers walking up the street . When they reached Thirty-Fourth Street Milly wanted to know what her father intended to do with her after the spring term of school was finished . " Will you ship me to camp again , like you did last summer , papa ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York with you . " He told her it was hot and sticky in the city . " New York is terrible in the summer , no breeze or wind at all , " he said . " I wo n't care . I could cook your meals for you , we could go to the movies together . You 'll see , I 'll be so good to you , papa , you wo n't want me to go back to school in the fall . " He did not tap the sidewalk with his cane for over twenty paces . " Well , Pika , what 'll you do with me in the summer ? "  | " I think you 'll go to camp again , Milly . " Then she took her arm away . " But I do n't want to go there , papa . I want to be in the city with you . " " We 'll pick out a different camp then . If you do n't like a camp in the mountains , maybe we can find one along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , taking his arm again . " I want to stay here with you . " They walked on , silent . " Why did you have to have your apartment cleaned when I came here for the holidays , papa ? You 're so mean to me sometimes . Why could n't you have waited until afterwards ? We could have lived together in your own apartment and then I could cook for you . This way we have to go out for all our meals . And anyway , I do n't care much for hotels , there 's nothing horny about them . " " The management could n't clean my rooms at any other time , " he told her , thinking fast , tapping his cane sharply against the sidewalk . " Bosh . If I were living with you I 'd tell them when to clean my place and , if they did n't like it , I 'd move . " He laughed shortly . " I would , " she said . " You bet I would . " He patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to see what kind of an apartment you live in . Before I go back to school I 'm going to look your place over . " " But they 're cleaning there , dear . " " I do n't care . I want to see what kind of rooms you 've got and if everything is comfortable enough . " He smiled , terror hiding behind his eyeballs . He tried to dissuade her , talking to her like a child , but this made her all the more determined , and by the time they had covered another block she was really angry with him . Tears stood in her eyes , she was almost crying . " But do n't you see I love you so much , papa , do n't you see I only want to look at the place and then go away ? All I want to do is to see it and leave , that 's all , papa , really . I want to see where you live . " Now , though his face was calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . How could he explain the young woman living there , how could he explain the whole affair ? He cleared his throat while his thoughts raced hard . " I have n't got the keys , " he said . " I had to give them to the house-painters . " " Then we 'll see the janitor , " she answered promptly . " He 'll have a duplicate set . " He had to tell his daughter the janitor had no keys for the apartment . " A month ago I lost my set , so he gave me the only one he had . " She set her small jaw , her eyes still misty . " Well , anyway , I want to see what kind of a neighborhood you live in , then , " she said and in this he was unable to budge her . So at Forty-Second Street they stepped into a cab and , before he could lean forward and tell the driver the destination , Milly bent over and told the fellow . She knew the address by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , to her father 's apartment house . The taxi rolled down Park Avenue , into Fourth Avenue , crossed Fourteenth Street , and pulled into Eleventh . Milly , her eyes alert , kept glancing from left to right out the windows . Old tenements and remodeled apartment houses stood side by side . They passed a few small churches . Turning to her father , smiling at him , she said she liked the locality , it was interesting . " So many bookshopsaround the corner , " she said.  |p151At  last the cab came to a dead stop before the Glen Cove Apartments . Mr. Boardman , sitting stiffly , felt his heart pounding harder than ever . What if Margie should walk out ? He took out his handkerchief and blew his nose quietly for a long time , holding the square of linen up to his face so that it practically hid all his features . Milly , who grew excited , wanted to get out and make sure the janitor had n't an extra key ( " They always have , papa , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but Mr. Boardman finally persuaded her not to be so foolish , and so at last the driver finally shifted gears . Standing at one of the windows on the second floor Mr. Franconi , who was spending Christmas in his flat , saw Mr. Boardman and a young girl sitting in the rear of the cab and wondered why they did not get out and enter the building . Finally the cab rolled off . Milly , staring back at the building , saw a little fellow walking excitedly up the street , no hat on his head , fire in his eyes , happiness all over his face , and wondered who he could be . Just as the cab whirled around the corner she saw that the young man had entered the doorway next to her father 's apartment house . Then the taxi was humming northward , passing Union Square . LEON FISHER had been shot up to heaven , he had been treading soft-boiled clouds all the way from Fifteenth Street . Just a little while ago ( he is now walking through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooming house rang and , when Celia 's aunt answered it ,  |p152she  found a special-delivery boy before the door with a letter for Leon Fisher , esquire , the little artist who had the third floor rear room east . She walked up the stairs with the letter , knocked on his door and , because he was not fully dressed , slipped the envelope under . Leon , just dressing , stooped , picked the letter up and tore it open . He read the brief note twice , his eyes racing across the typed sheet : " Dear Mr. Fisher , " the letter read and went on to say that owing to a clerical error in the offices the announcement of acceptance of his portrait of a young girl entitled " Celia " had been delayed in getting mailed to him . To remedy this , this special-delivery letter was being sent to inform him that the Pennsylvania National Academy was happy to include the picture in its forthcoming annual exhibition to be held in Philadelphia . Leon Fisher tore out of the house , treading soft-boiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all excited , his thoughts disarranged , his brain whirling . The exhibition , opening soon , was national in scope and attractedhuge press notices ; it was a feat , his getting in . His heart fluttered pleasantly , like a silken banner in the breeze , as the saying goes . As he half-ran up the street , the first thought in his head was to inform Comrade Helen of this stroke of luck . He stopped dead in his tracks , however , as he stood before her door . After all , this was Christmas morning , folks were sleeping yet . But his heart was still fluttering pleasantly like a silken banner in a buoyant breeze . He knocked . No answer , too soft a knock . . . . He knocked again , waiting , his heart picking up a beat or two . Still no answer . Could it be possible that they were still sleeping , Comrade Helen and her three comrades ? Why  --  it was almost noon , eleven o'clock anyway.  |p153He  knocked again , louder . He heard a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursing in Mexican no doubt , then the lock clicked , and Sid Turner poked a sleepy head out . Sid 's eyes were red , he was very tired and sleepy-looking . At first he did not see who it was in the hallway and his voice was gruff . Then Leon spoke . " Oh , it 's you , " said Sid and his voice changed . He smiled . " Is Comrade Helen there ? I came here to tell her my picture has been accepted by the Pennsylvania National Academy . " " That 's fine , say , that 's fine , " said Sid and smiled again . " I 'm glad to hear it . " And then he turned , speaking to Comrade Helen , whose bed was in the smaller bedroom next to the kitchen . Leon stood out in the hall , waiting , feeling excited , joy rushing from his throat in a flowing , silent shout . A minute passed . He stood closer to the crack of the door , nervously waiting for the girl to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently and swung it open a few inches more and he saw , with a start ( good Christ , his eyes must be playing tricks with him )  --  he saw Comrade Helen sitting on the edge of the double bed , dressing herself , hooking on her dress ; and in the same bed , his broad back and coarse black hair toward the door , lay the Mexican ! Sid , yawning at the door , saw Leon 's eyes . He clamped his jaws shut instantly , took in the situation . The little fellow out in the hallway began shivering . Helen and Morales ? Helen and the swarthy , stocky Mexican ? Sid poked his head out the door , no longer sleepy now . " Helen 's dressing , " he said . " She just went into Jose 's room to get her other dress . She hangs her things there , we 've got no other place for them . " Leon , hunched in the dim hallway , stopped shivering.  | Within his body a whimper died away . He swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door a little more , Leon could see very little of the inside of the flat now . In another minute Comrade Helen , her hair not yet combed , her face smooth and rosy from sleep , came toward the door , and at that moment Jose turned over sleepily in bed and grunted at her that a draft was coming in . So she closed the door and came out to stand in the hallwaynear Leon . Sid went back to bed . " I just happened to drop by , " said Leon , his eyes shining in the half-dark , his nostrils alive as he smelled her . He could smell she had just come from bed . " A picture of mine has been accepted by the Pennsylvania National Academy . " When she asked when he had received the news , he blurted out the truth , it came from his lips before he could stem the words . " I just got the letter , they sent a special delivery and I just got it a few minutes ago . " " And you came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have so much power over the fellow , he was putty in her hands and she knew it . " No , I just happened by , " he stammered quickly , " I just happened by , so I thought I 'd tell you . " In the hallway , her eyes growing accustomed to the light , seeing his large , blazing eyes on her , she smiled sweetly and stood looking at him . What a power she had over this little fellow , this **25;1726;TOOLONG communist ! She was a large , warm hearth-fire and he liked to be near her all the time . " Do you know what day it is ? " she asked , smiling at him . He nodded . " But , of course , Christmas means nothing to us ; we 're Party members . " Still , he felt as if he should have brought somethingp155along , anything , a small gift . He stood there rigidly , thinking fast . " What I really came over for , " he said , snatching at the first thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner and maybe to a show besides . I thought you would like that . " The special-delivery letter which he clutched in his hand and which he had figured on showing her , he now shoved out of sight , into a pocket of his coat . Comrade Helen accepted , she said she would be glad to go out with him . It was chilly in the hallway , she had no coat on . " Call for me at about four , " she said to him . " I 'll be ready then . Then we can go out together . " She spoke the last words softly . Christ , how his heart was going now , throbbing like a pond pump . It was still pounding hard even after she went inside . He stood in the hall alone , collecting his thoughts , pullinghimself together , and as he started walking toward the street he thought of Jason ; his excitement about the accepted painting leaped up again , and he started climbingthe flights to the ex-poet 's quarters . He came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished shaving . He was sitting reading the paper . " I just got a letter from Philadelphia , " said Leon , all excited again . Jason looked alive at once . Philadelphia ? " You 're a liar , " he said . " The mail is n't delivered today . Today 's Christmas , the church bells have been banging away all morning . " " I 've got a letter from Philadelphia in my pocket , " said Leon , hugging his secret , smiling at his friend . Hedug his hand into his overcoat and clutched the letter there . Then he noticed how strange Jason began to act , how Jason 's face changed . The ex-poet 's mouth was twitching . Leon started . " Well , hand it over , then ! " said Jason . " Good Christ , man , do you like to torture a fellow ? Hand it over , I say ! " Leon 's mouth hung open . Hand it over ? He looked at Jason 's face again . Why  --  the fellow 's cheeks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter quickly and placed it in Jason 's hands . He stood quiet , watching the life die out of Jason 's eyes , seeing the face go blank and dead again . " Oh , " grunted Jason , reading the typed note . " Yes , that 's fine , so you got in the show ? " He handed Leon the letter back . " It 'll be a big exhibition . Maybe I 'll get a write-up in the papers . " Jason was himself again , it did n't take him long . " You ought to win the first prize , " he said dryly . " How big is it , a thousand dollars , or a million ? " Leon stuck the letter into an inner pocket . He should have known better than to come up here feeling excited . " What are you doing today ? " he asked , changing the subject . Jason , picking up the paper again , pointed toward the old mantelpiece . Standing there , like a deadly-looking anti-aircraft shell , was a tall round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting drunk today . In that bag in yonder corner repose five oranges , waiting for the pressure of my godlike hands . Celebration , ring out ye cock-eyed bells , ring out . " Leon stood there with the letter hidden away . He knew Jason had not received a check for some weeks now and wondered how he had been able to purchase the gin . The ex-poet read his thoughts , and laughed mockingly.  | " Leon , I hereby inform you that yesterday I didst receiveanother check for one of my filthy masterpieces , this time for the sum of fifteen dollars . And further , my good lad , I am thinking seriously of renting that little room across the hall for a storehouse . I intend calling it the Gin Chamber of Mount Parnassus . How 's that ? The Gin Chamber of Mount Parnassus . " " I saw a sign hanging downstairs advertising the room , " said Leon , " but the janitress will never rent it . It 's too small , and besides no one would care to live there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason . " That room is reserved for me , I 'll tell the old dame to take her sign down right away . I 'll tell her I intend to transform it into a gin chamber . " " But you 'll have to pay her rent for it , and you owe her two months now , " said Leon . " What about the money ? " " Oh , money , " grunted Jason as he picked up his paper again . A HALF-HOUR LATER Comrade Helen was serving her three fellow comrades breakfast , and helping herself at the same time . In a large crock she stirred batter , scooped some out and let fall a ladle on the hot , greasecoveredpan . The wheat-cakes did n't taste so good , but the comrades were hungry and made no complaint . All ate in silence , chewing , picking up the soggy pancakes , staring at the table , drinking their coffee . The three young men sat with trousers and underwear  --  no shirts on . Afterwards Sid and his brother left , swallowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theyp168had some Party work to do and would be gone all day , they said . As soon as they were gone , the Mexican 's eyes took on a catlike gleam and , as Helen reached across the table for the sugar , he grabbed her wrists . " What was that fellow doing outside the door so early ? " he asked , holding her hard , hurting her . When she began clenching her teeth , wincing , he let her go . She told him , speaking meekly , that it was n't her fault , was it , if the little fellow had fallen for her ? And besides , what harm was there in it if he did hang around her ? " He never swears or hits me like you do . What 's the harm if we 're friends ? " Harm ? The Mexican laughed sneeringly . " No harm , " he said , " but I 'm getting tired of him snooping around . Every time he comes here I got to pretend you and I are merely friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the little fool must be blind . The next time he comes here I 'll fix him , I 'll tell him right out . I 'll tell him we sleep together every night . " Helen went to the sink and began washing the dishes . He knew he had her cornered and knew also she did not want him to tell Leon . Why she did not want to lose the little fellow 's friendship and adoration she did not just know herself . " I 'll tell him all about it , " Jose was saying to her . " I 'd like to see his face . Maybe I 'll even tell him about that other man down in New Orleans . " She turned full around and worked at the dishes , not answering him . He sat staring at her back . Finally he got up from the table and stood next to her at the sink , sneeringat her , watching her hands fumbling with the dishes . Leaning toward her he grinned wider , then inserted his hand downward from the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare flesh . She shivered and wrenched his hand away . He gripped both her wrists again , viselike . His pressure was terrific . Shovinghis smooth , round , golden face close to hers he grinned catlike , breathing hard and hot upon her face . His grip was painful and she began whimpering . " Jose , " she said , " Jose , " and a warm , drowsy wave of helplessness flowed over her . He began speaking softly in Spanish , still gripping her hard . The pain increased until her mouth fell slowly open , until she leaned against his chest . She grew weaker and weaker , tasting the bitter sweetness of his strength , flowingtoward him , her eyes closing , no fight or hate in her body . She slipped her arms around his waist with a moan as soon as he released her . Bending his head , lowering it over so that it stood harshly forward from the column of his powerful neck like a bull 's , he bit her on her left shoulder , working her house-dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bit her twice . Then , because she was so helpless now , he had to lift her up to get her into the small room off the kitchen . He carriedher there as if she were a damp , limp bag of sand . AT FOUR O'CLOCK Leon knocked on the door , rapping softly . Comrade Helen , alone , thinking , sitting at the table looking at her hands , got up and opened it . There stood Leon , smiling . She smiled back , though her eyes were rather slack and her face pale . " Everybody gone ? " said the little fellow brightly , glancing about , feeling good because Jose was not around.  |p160The  girl nodded . Sid and Harry had gone out right after breakfast , Jose had left a little over an hour ago , he was going to see some of his countrymen in the Bronx . While Comrade Helen went into the bedroom to change into another dress , Leon sat at the table . He drummed his fingers happily upon the top of it while he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved around there . Finally she came out , looking a bit more cheerful , her hair in order , color on her cheeks , a black silk dress snug against her body . Leon 's eyes were furnaces again . Comrade Helen stood there smiling . " You 've got a new necktie on , " she said , looking at him quizzically . " No , " he answered , lying , " it 's an old one , " and he smiled back , still feeling that inner breathlessness he felt every time he was troubled by the soft contours of her figure . He stood up , helped her with her coat . On the street she took his arm , his heart started " throbbing . " Where are you taking me ? " she said . He told her , clearing his throat first . " I thought we 'd go some place for dinner first and afterwards take in a show . Maybe the vaudeville at the Jefferson Theater , I have n't seen vaudeville for a long time . Would you care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at that moment liked him very much . " But it 'll be expensive , " she said . He puffed his chest out , beginning to sweat at the firm feel of her arm . Expensive ? What difference did that make ? Besides , his picture had been accepted for a big exhibition . " No , " he answered , " I can manage it , " and he stared ahead like a young rooster just learning the thrill of mighty crowing . They walked toward Second Avenue . It was only fourp161o'clock , but already the sky was pale and dirty-looking and dusk was coming on . Before a small Italian restaurant in a side street they stood talking , discussing the prices , the food , and if they really wanted an Italian meal . Finally they went inside . Leon , standing behind Helen , helped her with her coat and hung it up , and after they sat down he ordered for both , his voice quavery , his heart fluttering like a silken banner in the breeze . The place was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had spotted tablecloths . The waiter , a tired fat fellow , nodded his bald head sleepily and shuffledup and back with the food , which was not so hot . When darkness came on , the waiter reached up a fat arm and clicked the light on . He grunted . His shirt had worked loose as he had raised his arm and now he fumbled with the ends of it . Leon and Comrade Helen , the only customers , all alone , sitting on opposite sides of the table , eatingtogether , the little fellow raising his eyes often and smiling , took their time . Two cold slabs of apple pie came out , the dessert . The waiter came forward when they were almost finished and , shaking a tin can , sprayed powdered sugar upon the pieces left . Then he walked slowly back to the kitchen , his damp service-towel swinging on his crooked arm . In Leon 's pocket some rolled-up papers rustled  --  charcoaldrawings he had done in school . They finished their coffee , the waiter took most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Leon , when the waiter was standing near , when the fat guy was absently scratching his ear . " It will cost a nickel extra , " the waiter said , easing up , his face as alive and alert as the cold slabs of pie he had brought out before.  |p164good  against the face and wonderful going down your lungs . Toward the west the lighted-up clock in the tower of the public utilities building pointed to half-past eight . Comrade Helen said it was still early yet , happy words to Leon Fisher . So they walked a bit . They went along Fourteenth Street , into the broil of the East Side . Crowds milled slowly , men stood slackly against the sides of stores and buildings , looking the janes over , waiting and hoping for a pick-up . And now , even though it was Christmas day , the venders still were on duty , shoving their toys , shoelaces , rayon socks , candy-bars , and other truck before the passing faces . More beggars than ever sprawled , stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comrade Helen continued west , walking slowly . They passed Union Square and saw the sky , like a pale sheet of muslin , hanging above the little park . No stars were out , no moon . When they reached Fifth Avenue , the long line of arc lamps coming closer and closer together in the distance was nice to look at ; the lamps shone against the black asphalt , cars hummed along . It was quiet here , few folks . They stood before the bright windows of Ross 's Klock Korner and studied the tiers of clocks , all kinds of them , metal ones , wooden ones , clocks made of Dutch saucers , windmills , and candy-boxes . And when they returned slowly eastward , it was still early . They looked aloft and once more saw the time in the tall tower . Comrade Helen said it was still early , music to Leon Fisher 's ears . They crossed over and walked on the other side of Fourteenth Street , and , as they came up to the Automat , Comrade Helen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They went inside . Leon hunted around until he spottedp165a table away back in the rear , off to one side . He brought two cups of coffee over , asked Comrade Helen if she wanted something else , a piece of pastry , a baked apple , anything ? She shook her head , smiled at him . The little fellow was all warmed up by her , he sat down and asked how many spoonfuls , and poured the sugar in . Then , glancing around , looking here and there , hither and yon , he brought out the roll of drawings again , spoke about art , art school , and three or four well-known painters . He mentioned , casually , that he had done a few drawingsfrom life in his student days . He said nothing about the instructor who had told the class time and again that Leon Fisher was the best student enrolled . The girl , sipping her coffee , urged him to show her the drawings . He took the rubber band off , spread the sheets out carefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indifferent to things artistic as she was , Comrade Helen sensed immediatelythat the fellow had power . His shadings were clean-cut and concise and by the use of a few strong , harsh lines he had the curves powerfully drawn , sure and firm . All the models were young women , reclining , standing , three-quarter facing , profile and back poses . The drawing of the back pose was startling , one single line taking care of the deep , narrow spinal groove . She looked at the last of them , then glanced at them all over again . Leon , his lips against the coffee cup , sat happily . He saw that now she was impressed . And when he walked her back to the tenement , when they stood alone in the damp , narrow , dim hallway , she was still impressed by his drawing and remembered how several Party members had spoken of the striking posters he had made for parades . Before her door she thanked him for thep166afternoon and evening . She said she had enjoyed it very much . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy feeling in his throat . And just before she opened the door , she held her hand out and he took it , feeling her pressure , hearing her murmur something in a low voice because she thought Jose or the Turner brothers might be back by now . " Some day I 'll pose for you , " she said , her hand on the knob . " I 'll pose for you . . . in the nude if you wantme to .... " Her words still hung in the hall after she was inside . He stood there like a stick , still hearing them . . . in the nude . . . if you want me to . . . . Well , what was wrong with that ? What the hell was wrong with that , he demanded of himself ? Had n't he painted hundreds and hundreds of nudes from life down at the art school ? But he stood there conscious of the floatingwords still hanging in the dark , quiet hallway . . . if you want me to . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chill air cooled his brow . . . if you want me to . . . . Did she really mean it , would she take off her clothes and stand before him as he sketched her ? . . . if you want me to . . . He kept walking around the square , the teeth of his brain chewing nervously and biting at his thoughts . He must have walked around the square six or seven times , his thoughts tumbling , pro and con arguments shuttling through his mind , speculating , visioning , imagining , wondering . Far ahead someone else was going around the square , following the low , thick wall  --  a little fellow who walked jerkily : James Nicholson , cracked printer , student of Romanculture , a first-rate typesetter in his rational days . At the south side of the square the nut began tossing cardsp167in the air , flinging them out like handbills to a starving public . Leon , his eyes ahead , saw the squares of paper flutter to the sidewalk . He trod on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluish lamps had a misty haze about them , dampness hung low over the Yuletide town . Finally , bendingover , Leon picked a card from the pavement . He stopped to read . In old-fashioned type , beautifully spaced and set up , the print stared forth like a bold command : Men Are Made for Warand Women for ProcreationThe printer , his pockets depleted , broke into a halfrunand hurried southward to his rooms on Thirteenth Street . VIAND THE EX-POET , what was he doing on this merry holiday ? Well , Jason was getting a headache from the continued bell ringing of the neighborhood , and to cure this feeling , why of course applied himself to his healing " balm , " or , in other words , he plied the bottle , that tall bottle that stood upright like a wicked anti-aircraft shell . The bells eased off , the " balm " worked sure as prayer . In a short while he was lolling at ease on his old worn cot , one hand holding a glass , the other making wobbly circles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spigot and allowed the flow to splash and tumble where it willed . " Blow , bugles , blow , " he mumbled sloppily , " and answer , hot dogs , answer , wharking , jarking , karking . On Fourteenth Street the mustard 's green , in Union Square the mob is queen . Blow , bugles , blow , set the wild echoes barking . And answer , comrades , answer , harking , larking , farking . " Finally , sitting up , he took a pencil in his fingers and tried to write the ode just composed , but the paper blurred before his eyes . It did n't matter , he wrote the piece down anyway , his hand strangely heavy and slow-moving against the sheet . " This should win the grand prix at the Pennsylvania National Academy , " he mumbled to himself . He tossed down a few more hookers , the liquid sliding down his throat like smooth , warm silk ; hot ribbons spread out all over his belly , a good , nice feeling . He started to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church now , striking the half-hour in loud , sonorous tones . He sat up , aroused . He reached over and picked up a postcard from the table received in the mail yesterday from Miss Allen , the nurse . She wrote she would be waiting in the hospital vestibule at four o'clock on Christmas day . The chimes ended , half-past four now . Jason got up hurriedly , put his hat on , shoved his arms into his overcoat and went on down the stairs , his thoughts confused , his legs jerking , feeling weak . When he reached the hospital , Miss Allen was still waiting , looking lonely and disappointed . " I 'm a hound , " he mumbled drunkenly , standing before her , his hat on wrong , his mouth loose and full from the gin . She took his arm in silence , and they began walking south along Seventh Avenue . Darkness settled down upon the city , the dusk was going gray with fog . " I forgot about your postcard , " he muttered , heavy on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the street , his knees felt so watery . They kept on walking . " Where should we go ? " he asked . The girl suspected he had no money and was afraid to offer to pay admission to a movie ; she was afraid also that as soon as they 'd enter a show Jason would fall asleep immediately in his seat . She led him eastward , listening to his mumbled babble , holding his arm at the crossings , staringstraight ahead . " Ever hear of Philadelphia ? " he mumbled . " I got ta pome there , it 's gon na win grand prix there . And answer , comrades , harking , larking , farking . Blow , bugles , blow , send your wild echoes out above the windy town . Keep on blowing , 0 hearty notes . " He received no answer from the girl at his side . Walking erect , head straight as a soldier 's , stride firm , she continued to hold his arm . Crossing Sixth Avenue at Eighth Street they had a train of elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " There 's thunder in the air , " he sputtered blearily . " Thunder . Roar , world , keep on roaring , a hundred and thirty million tacklers give us back reply . How 's that , Miss Allen ? I 'm going strong , aye , mighty strong indeedy . Roar , world , keep on roaring . Thunder away ! " She pressed his arm and , leaning heavily against her , he allowed her to walk him on . And as they walked , his weight against her side , another weight started pressing on her heart . He told her Philadelphia was a great town , that it was the greatest place in the whole wide world , only too few people were aware of that important fact , that was the trouble . " A young lady I know lives there , " he went on ,  | babbling to himself . " Until a few short months ago I occupieda strong position within the fortress of her heart . Then she tossed me down into the moat , out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain language , she gave me the air . Her name was Sylvia , she has wavy hair like yours . " The nurse allowed him to babble on . He told her all about it , speaking of moonlight and roses , lovers and cotton-candy , slurring his words , beating his breast in mock futility . " She says I was a weakling , that I broke too many promises on the liquor issue , so I says , I says to her , well , what of it , what thahell of it and she says nothing , not a word , says she . So she got herself transferred to Philly , a place in God 's country and here I am and thassa way it is , my friend . Say , your arm is heavy . Is my arm heavy , dearie ? " The nurse , looking ahead , shook her head . After another block was covered , silence fell upon the ex-poet . The chill , damp early evening air revived him a bit , his mouth grew firm , he drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming darkness . The street lamps came on . " I 'm a hound , " he muttered savagely , and said no more . Then they came out of the end of a street full into Washington Square . Near the Arch of Triumph stood a huge Christmas tree with lights blazing in all the branches , giving out a merry Christmas atmosphere , causing people to view pleasantly and state smilingly , " Ah , the Christmas spirit , see the pretty tree . " A few buses , like old cows standing near a lonely fence , stood four-fifths empty near the rail at the south end of the chilly square . Chauffeurs were pulling at a last few drags of their cigarettes before rolling northward in the cars again . The walks were deserted . A few autos hurriedp171along the curving drives into the side streets . Above the Judson Tower a little cross perched against the dark sky was lit up with electric bulbs , while toward the east the buildings of New York University stood stark and gray like limestone masonry , like blockhouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm away and stood quietly with her hands in her coat pockets . Jason stared toward the big buses to the south . " I 'm a hound , " he repeated . Miss Allen took his arm again , gave it a gentle pressure , and they started walking up one of the empty paths . The big circular fountain held no water , no spray shot up . For the next half-hour they walked the paths in silence , the brilliant lights of the huge Christmas tree at their backs . Jason started gagging gently , he had the urge to spit big , heavy pieces of slime upon the pavement . He had the feeling it would be nice to lie quietly on his cot right now . " If I had a decent place I 'd ask you up , " he told Miss Allen . " I know you 're tired of walking . But I live in filth , I 'm lazy and unambitious , I have no urge to grab the jack , to be one of the go-gettum , **34;1753;TOOLONG boys . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll never amount to anything . " " You go home and rest , " she answered . " I 've got to be back on duty soon . " " But I 'm telling you , " he argued hotly , stopping and looking at her , " I 'm telling you I 'm just a drunk , you 're wasting time in even talking to me . I 'm a bum ! " " Oh , do n't talk like that , " she pleaded . " God , do n't talk that way . " " But you 've got to know ! " he shot back . " I 'm telling you for your own good ! " Then she saw his face was feverish . She took his armp172again and they started walking . The lights of the tall Fifth Avenue apartment houses were twinkling , wreaths hung in some of the windows . More autos , like squat , militarybowling balls rolled along the groove between the curbstones of the street , going almost silently . They walked north and cut west at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at him , at his burntoutyouth and talent . Her mouth trembled . She asked him to promise her that he would n't drink any more , that he 'd try to get a grip on himself . The words rang faintly , with a familiar echo in his mind . He stared hard up the street . " Rats ! " he said . " To hell with it . No promises for me . Rats ! " Then , when he saw her face , he mumbled something in an undertone . He told her he might walk over the coming Thursday afternoon , he said he 'd think about it . He spoke in a mutter . " I wish you would , " she answered . " I 'll wait in the vestibuleanyway . " Then he walked off , going near the curb . A half a block down he started spitting slime . He had to lean a hand against a lamp-post , he felt so weak from coughing . But when he reached Fourth Avenue , he was all right again , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rats ! " he said out loud , speaking viciously . " I make no promises to anybody . To hell with them all ! " And with a determined stride he walked on toward the tenement . MILES TO THE NORTH , somewhere near the Bronx , Old Running Water , belching as he rose , finally left thep173dinner table and sank into the big , soft Cogswell chair . About him was his family ; today the Big Chief was at home . In the parlor , standing near the front windows , was the family Christmas tree purchased for the grandchildren , the kiddies , with lights and toys in the lower branches ( the Big Chief could n't reach very high without straining himself  --  and his wife was old and short ) . His four grandchildren , small kids , itched to take the baubles down ; one of them was two years old and kept on bawling , reaching out his little fists . Old Running Water grunted cheerfully , he would give the command when he was ready . The two sons-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had married Old Running Water'svirgin gals , sat with white collars and pale hands ( both were office-workers ) , glancing with servile smiles at the old man , thinking of his bank account . They took the old boy 's fifteen-cent cigars and both , at once , offered burning matches to the Big Chief 's face . Old Running Water , bending forward and grunting , puffed until he had the perfecto going good , a nice feeling in his heavy , aging bones . In the kitchen his two daughters , their kids at their skirts , were helping the old woman with the dishes . The sound of clattering plates , small talk , splashing water , drifted toward the front room . The two sons-in-law , long slack hands upon their lanky knees , cigars sticking from their mouths , puffing on the old man 's fifteen-centers , talked about conditions , working themselves in ( thinking of the old gent 's bank account ) , discussed the times , the coming elections , and the fact that only yesterday a prominent banker was quoted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rounded and now the dawn of better times was surely breaking . In a rather sugary way they sat there talking to the heavy old man . Old Running Water , thinking of four dots after four men 's names ( one dot as large as a good-sized bullet hole ) , puffed in silence , his eyes half-closed in thought . " It 's bound to come , but the good Lord only knows when , " he said , speaking of better times , of the cornucopia of plenty , of the mural oil paintings showing a calm-faced , high-bosomed dame holding out both arms , books in one , wheat , corn , bananas , plums , and sundry fruit and food in another . " Bankers  --  they say good times are just around the corner , but what corner , there 's the rub . The town is full of corners , boys , a man can rub his backside raw against a thousand of ' em . " The two fellers , the sons-in-law , showing their yellow teeth in a sugary smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever mind , he knew how to turn a phrase or two , the old boy did . And when the old gent told them how the warehouse business was dropping off , how the loads were dwindling , how the freight reports indicated a sharp decline in shipping and that a few of the hands would have to be laid off , why they listened seriously , the lanky sonsin-lawdid . One of them stroked his long knees in silence , the other tapped the end of his cigar gently , freeing it from ash . In the kitchen the women were cleaning up , finishing the after-labor of the heavy meal . The kids were bawling there , quarreling and tugging at their mothers ' skirts . The oldest , a five-year old , had to have his ears boxed . He howled and cried , then all was quiet again . Dusk came on . The steam in the radiators made a little , piping sound . One of the kids bent down , crouched and cocked his ear near the pipes . " Tweet , tweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparrows , " tweet , tweet . " The radiators piped their busy little lay . Laying aside the butt of his fifteen-center , Old Running Water spoke to his short old dame , spoke in a monotone , in a low voice so that the kiddies would n't catch the wordies . The old woman , looking sly , smiling , went into the pantry and returned with a bottle . The sons-in-law grew watery about the mouth , they had sampled the old man 's stuff before . The old boy poured out three drinks gurglegurgleinto short glasses ( " Women should n't touch a drop , " was his motto in life ) , while the kiddies looked on . " What 's that , grandpop ? " asked the five-year old , a curious lad . " Grape juice , " answered the Big Chief right away . The sons-in-law , like a small Greek chorus , repeated . " He-he , grape juice , " and sniffed hungrily , foretasting the strong , good drink . The men drank , the women sat by and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pawed his grandpa 's lap and begged for a sip , just a little sip and , laughing genially , the folds of his belly rolling like oily waves , the old man complied . The kid 's tongue darted out , he made a face . The whole room sat back and rocked and roared as the kid clawed his mouth . This was the bright spot of the evening ; the sons-in-law sat laughing the longest , casting sidelong glances at the bottle half full yet . But the old boy 's beefy arm did not move , did n't even budge ; there he sat like a gigantic pot-roast , solid and heavy in the bowl of the chair . Afterwards the kids were given toys and presents , the old grandmother stood by with watery eyes and kissed them as they came running up to show her the gifts . She wore false plates of teeth inp176her mouth and her lips were indrawn as if sucking in the air . She stood there , old and happy . And as night fell , the two young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale hands , looked toward their wives , asking with their eyes that they go home now . But the girls sat on for a while longer , the kids were still talkingexcitedly to the old grandmother . At last , when Old Running Water 's heavy head was fallingbreastward , the women rose , dressed the kids , got everything ready , and finally stood in the front room . The old dame shook her husband gently . The Big Chief stirred . The sons-in-law , standing in hats and overcoats , gave a few last sugary smiles , showing yellow teeth , thanking the Big Chief for the dinner , thinking of his cozy bankroll . The front door banged at last , the kids hollered in the hallway . When they reached the street , they looked back and saw the colored Christmas lights in the evergreen tree at the front window , and waved their chubby mittened fists at the building . By this time Old Running Water , spittle dribbling from one corner of his relaxed mouth , was snoring away . But at the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving back at them with quick , feeble , loving motions of the hand until they passed the second arc lamp down the street . Then she lost them in the darkness . Coming back into the center of the room she stood old and quiet before her snoring husband , thinking of their fading years . His tremendously swollen limbs lay slackly sprawled like sawed-off logs dumped this way and that . Walking up , approaching him in silence , the old woman took out her handkerchief and wiped the wet corner of the old man 's mouth . Then she stood looking at him again , thinking of their fading years . Her nose went moist andp177her eyes puckered , she wondered if there was enough chicken left over to do for supper tomorrow night . In the quiet room , standing before the heavy old man sprawled in the green Cogswell chair , she thought the matter over . The light from the floor lamp fell upon the golden fuzz of the Big Chief 's forearm . Time went  --  tick and tock , and the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter Milly came out of the Roxy Theater and began walking down Seventh Avenue , taking their time . In the lobby of the big movie palace Mr. Boardman had had to wait a bit , until his daughter paid a visit to the women 's rest-rooms . She returned smiling at him , looking at him quizzically , tilting her head to one side , and he smiled back as a matter of course , not knowing why she smiled . She hooked her arm through his as they started walking down the street . The lights of the great white way flashed on and off , traffic hummed and roared up and down the Times Square sector . " Are you tired , papa , do you want to go back to the hotel ? " " Do you ? " he asked , patting her arm . " I 'm asking you , " she said . " You 've got to answer me , I 've asked you first . " " We 'll walk a while yet , Milly . " So they went along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughteron his arm . They made a good appearance , some folks turned to stare . " I bet they think we 're married , " the daughter said , squeezing his arm , feeling happy . " I bet they do . "  | Mr. Boardman smiled . " But I would n't have an old papa like you , " she pouted . " You 're horrid , anyway , " little bits of love hidden behind her girlish words . " This summer I 'm coming to live with you in town , and that 's all there is to it . You hear ? " " We 'll think it over , Milly . " " No , we wo n't , papa . My mind is made up . You 're not to give the matter another thought . " " It 's getting dampish out , " he said , seeing the bluish haze about the big electric signs . They kept on walking . At Forty-Sixth Street he suddenlythought of something , and cleared his throat . " I 've got to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll go with you , " his daughter said , and they entered a drug store . Now he was sorry he had n't phoned while Milly had visited the rest-rooms , he could have done it very easily then . He went up to the cashier and changed a dime for two nickels , then locked himself in a phone booth . Milly , hummingsoftly to herself , stood near the perfume counter , looking at the pretty bottles . She took a small mirror from her purse , held it to her face and started smiling at herself . No , he had n't noticed yet . In the booth Mr. Boardman dropped a nickel in the slot and gave a number . The phone rang for a long time . Then the coin returned . His heart began to hammer slowly , heavily . Was n't she in , was she out ? Once more he inserted the nickel into the slot , heard the pleasant ping and gave the number and this time he heard the phone ring at the other end for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last , just as he was about to hang up , he heard a click , then a woman 's voice , a slow , sleepy , lazy hello ,  | " Hello-o , " and there it was , that throaty voice he knew so well . Someone else was laughing somewhere . " Hello-o , " the woman said again , loud and getting cross , but still good-natured . Mr. Boardman , his brow damp in the little , stuffy booth , his ear alert , could hear , very faintly , a man 's voice somewhere . A crossed wire , or a man at her side ? Which ? His face went gray , he wet his lips again . " Hello , " he said . " Oh , it 's you , " came the throaty answer , and the man 's voice somewhere was cut short immediately , only the even quiet humming of a good connection reached Mr. Boardman'sear . Margie started complaining about a noise , about the bum wire , about voices , and made her own voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I seem to hear another party talking . Can you hear me , can you hear my voice ? " Mr. Boardman , his heart hammering very heavy now , said he could . " Try and get a clear wire , Boardie , I can hardly hear you . " Mr. Boardman clicked up and down a few times , caughtthe attention of the operator and asked for a clearer wire . " The wire is clear , sir , " came the answer after a while . " Thank you , " said Mr. Boardman . He wet his lips againand spoke to Margie . " Can you hear me now ? " " Yes , that 's much better , " she said . " I just called up to see how you were and to wish you a very merry Christmas . " She thanked him and told him it was very thoughtful of him , sending her those flowers that had arrived in the morning . He replied he hoped she liked them . Then , in a plaintive voice , in a tone borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lonely , and she missed him , and her arms were aching , and when was his child going back to school ? She kissed twice with her lips over the miles of wire . " I love you , honey , you know I do . " That throaty , croony voice . " My God , what a wire we 've got ! " Mr. Boardman thought he heard smothered laughter . When he hung up , his thoughts were lulled a little , but not much . He was no fool . He walked from the stuffy phone booth and wiped his brow with his handkerchief , his heartbeatgoing back to normal . At the perfume counter his daughter was talking with the young woman clerk there and looking at some pretty bottles with silk bows tied around their necks . She turned as soon as he came out and faced him smilingly . " What kept you so long , was it very important ? " " No , " he answered , " just a little call I had to make . " Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lamplights and shops on all sides , the girl could contain herself no longer and stopped before a mirror in a millinery store . " Well , have n't you noticed anything ? " she asked , frowning and smiling expectantly at the same time . Noticed ? No , his eyes were turned inward upon himself now , toward the darkness of his mind . He had n't noticed anything , he was still listening to that smothered laughter , to a man 's voice urging a woman to please hang up and come over again on his knee where she belonged . He tapped the sidewalk sharply a few times with the tip of his cane . " Papa , you 're not looking at my face . " He looked , and saw nothing , only her half-frowning , half-smiling stare . " Do n't you notice anything , papa , do n't you see anythingnew or different ? "  |p181Her  lower lip began to tremble with disappointment , he noticed nothing after all . " I 've put some lip rouge on , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on when I left you in the lobby of the show , you have n't noticed me at all . " And then he saw  --  her lips were carefully penciled and now he noticed she was quite grown up , a graceful young lady . He stood there looking at her , seeing her , his mind on other things . His stare was blank . " I 'll take it off if you do n't like it , " she said quickly , seeing how gray and vacant he looked . " If you do n't like me like this I 'll take it off , " and she opened her purse for her handkerchief . " That 's all right , " he said as they started walking . " No , it is n't . I 'll take it off . " She spat upon her handkerchief , then began rubbing her mouth vigorously . " There , " she said , " I 'm just the same as ever , papa , you 've got no fault to find at all with me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day . In the morning he sat near the front windows reading the papers , turning the pages slowly , allowing his eye and mind to wander occasionally . By swinging his glance to the side he could command a good view of the street below . This was a good way to spend the day . House-slippers were upon his feet and a silk lounging robe was wrapped about his body . When he grew tired reading the news of the day , he lay quietly upon the sofa , relaxed , and staredp182thoughtfully up at the dull tone of the ceiling . He started thinking of his life , of the years just passed . He remembered the ship he had come over to America in . It was a big clumsy boat and there had been a storm on the way over . That was thirteen years ago , he had been what is known as a " greenhorn " then . He remembered many scenes , many pictures , and felt , now , as though he had come a very long way . Much water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembered that a relative had met him at the gangplank of the boat where all the immigrants had been shoved cattle-like down upon the shores of America and the relative had pumped and pumped his hand , a glad look on his honest face . In a big , bare room the immigrants were herded , segregated , and tagged , then the relative who waited outside took him by subway to a cold , drafty flat somewhere near Canal Street , and that night friends and more ' relatives pumped his hand , smiled gladly at him , and asked him many questions about Bessano . But already their words were flavored foreignly and they injected American words into their Italian which he did not understand . When he asked questions , they laughed and clapped him hard and friendly upon the shoulder . Later on the relative who had met him at the dock , a third cousin and a good man , though he had stabbed somebody at a festival back in Italy , took him aside and began talking over plans for the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American words and terms , Mr. Franconi had been apprenticed to a barber on lower Third Avenue . He learned how to say , " Shave ? " " Haircut ? " " A good tonic ? " and acquired the knack of slightly raising his eyebrows while questioning . More words and terms came , in due time . He was conscientious , he worked carefully , he wanted the customer to feel satis/fled . By slow degrees , always doing good work , he worked himself up into the better shops , subduing his voice , raisinghis eyebrows in a more refined manner , " Shave ? " " Haircut ? " " A good tonic for the scalp ? " Now he worked in a Wall Street barber shop , one of the best in town , had a following of his own and made a decent living . Thinking about his slow but steady progress up the tonsorialladder took Mr. Franconi 's mind away from other things . It took his mind away from his first years here in this country , when he had gone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like all the other Latin jazz-hounds and had had only one thing on his mind  --  women . He had been a wild buck and had had his share , mostly American girls , all kinds of them , blondes , brunettes , red-heads , and once or twice had gone into the Harlem jungle for a change of scenery . He had burned himself out . He was tainted , too . " I think we will have it arrested in a few more treatments , " Dr. Morrison , who had offices on Madison Avenue , said after almost every visit . " However , we must not be too optimistic as yet . You must continue taking treatments . " In the neighborhood the bells rang off and on , the echoes fading over the cloudy town . Mr. Franconi could hear , faintly , phonograph music . The young " Russian " couple who lived on the floor above were entertaining , spending a " Russian " Christmas day at home . The record being played was a merry metelitza , a Russian dance . Vanya and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at home to their guests , a young artistic couple living on Charles Street in the Village . They were telling the guests all about the knickknacks on the mantelpiece , the perfectflow of Turgenevian and Gogolian prose , also about the quaint customs of White and Little Russia , where the peasants sang as they stacked the wheat and hay and the tolling of the chimes floated sweetly over the fields . " Then you 're communists ? " inquired the guests , noting the knickknacks , seeing a samovar on the little parlor table . " No , " came the answer quietly . " What we admire is the old Russia , the tsareviches , the troikas , and the singing peasants under the barins . " " Oh , " said the guests , making a round 0 with their mouths , . admiring the shiny copper belly of the samovar . Vanya , beaming , went over to the phonograph and put on the merry metilitza again . Downstairs Mr. Franconi heard it as he lay quiet on the sofa . Later he got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Against the front walls of the Catholic school across the street there were no shadows , the wide strong front loomed up- like the set face of a heavy , gloomy man . The big doors of the garage next to it were grimly closed against the street . Mr. Franconi thought of himself as a staunch Catholic but had long since stopped going to church . Why , he did not just know . America . He had stopped going , that was all . He stood at the window a long time and stared down the length of empty street which ran dead end into Fourth Avenue . He was still standing there when the doorbell buzzed . He wondered who it could be and stood quiet , thinking . Then he went to answer it . " Hello , " he spoke down into the hallway . The answer , almost a half-shout , came back quickly in Italian . Mr. Franconi was somewhat astonished . " Gregorio ? " " Si , Andre , " and Gregorio came inside , a short , powerfulman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italia Club . He came in smiling , shook Andre 's hand with vigor and stood in the doorway , twirling his hat . He had a big , round , shiny face . " Come in . " He came inside and saw the quiet , tastefully furnished apartment . He had never paid Andre a visit before . He stood there playing with his hat , smiling , his face more shiny than ever . " Sit down , " said Andre . Gregorio , grinning broadly , set the edge of his healthy rump on the edge of the sofa . Mr. Franconi held out cigarettes and struck a match . Through the first bluish haze of smoke he saw the round face of his friend and wondered at the visit . Then Mr. Franconi remembered to give Christmas greetings . The men shook hands again , Gregorio warmly , spouting Italian greetings by the yard , goodness all over his moon-face . He had a hearty voice . Blowing a huge cloud of cigarette smoke straight ahead , starting to sweat , his eyes popping , Gregorio blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my home for the evening , Andre ? People will be there . My brother Joe is bringing his mandolin . There will be wine and food , good wine . . . . " Now he was sweating good , and blew another cloud of smoke . Andre , his head tilted pleasantly to one side , a friendly look in his eyes , waited for more . " . . . Ai , the wine will be good , Andre . And besides , there will be girls . . . . " Gregorio grinned broader than ever . Andre , looking rougish , smiled back , the cat was out of the bag now . He knew . One of the young women he had danced with at the Italia Club had been Gregorio 's sister , a squat , robust girl whose thighs had quivered against his all through thep186dancing . Mr. Franconi understood , she was of a marriageableage , her folks had her on the auction block , she herself was hot and ready for a man . Mr. Franconi , reaching over , lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile at each other , but all the while Gregorio sensed that Andre would not come over to his folks ' house . He sat there with a set smile on his full , firm face , and called himself a fool , imagining that the great Andre , that wolf of a fellow , would waste time at the home of his people , or with his sister . Finally he made a jest and both men laughed heartily , smiling at each other , grinning at each other 's eyes . Mr. Franconi went into the kitchen and came back with a bottle and poured wine into two small glasses . He held the first glass out to Gregorio and they clinked to each other , then drank . The wine was excellent . Mr. Franconi poured another . Gregorio stood up , ready to go . He stood there stocky and thoughtful . " I should have told you sooner , Andre . A man like you , you must have made arrangements days ago . " Once more his eyes swept over the flat . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the door they shook hands , Gregorio with much vigor , his face shiny , his eyes slightly fiery from the wine . " Be sure to give your family my Christmas greetings , " said Mr. Franconi , speaking in Italian . " Give your sister Teresa my regards too . " " I will , Andre , I will . " He shook hands again , then hesitated . " Who is coming up this evening , Andre ? " Half his body out the doorway , he twirled his hat on a short finger and leered obscenely into the flat . Mr. Franconi gave his practiced , pleasant smile for answer . ( " Shave ? " " Haircut ? " " A good tonic for thep187scalp ? " ) The hat went round Gregorio 's stubby finger at a quick pace . " A blond one , Andre ? " Andre smiled back , his lip muscles set . " A good thing I did not drop in later , Andre . I would have come upon you at the critical moment , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be sure to come to the club soon again , Andre . " He stuck his fist out impulsively and for the third time shook hands hard . Mr. Franconi stood at the door until the entrance door closed below . There was a gentle bang . Then he closed the apartment door against the hallway . He walked into the bathroom , clicked on the light , and standing before the mirror over the sink began stroking slowly the sides of his face . Allowing the cold water to flow for a long time , he finally placed a brown pill upon his tongue , followed by a quick , expert gulp of water . Then he clicked all the lights of the flat out and with legs , arms , chest , belly and mind relaxed , lay quiet on the sofa , thinking slow thoughts in the dark and in this way enjoyed a certain peace of mind . This is how Mr. Andre Franconi spent Christmas day . " THAT GUY 'S dropping cards again , " said Officer McGuffy , going toward his comrade Hajek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about men and war , but he 's got a long word in it I do n't just understand . I ought to run him in . " " Oh , he 's just another nut , " said Hajek , motioning to the north-south traffic to get a move on , to advance a bit more snappily . McGuffy , standing near his pal , stared atp188the windows of the shops across the way , which already were taking on a post-Christmas look , though from the distance the cotton still resembled snow . The Fourteenth Street sidewalks were still crowded , in front of Loft 's a jam of folk were waiting for the traffic lights to change . " Well , guess I 'll stroll around , " McGuffy said and crossed over , twirling his nightstick behind his back , just for the exercise of it . At the curb he slowed down , eased his pace as a young woman stepped up into a trolley , then sauntered on , whistling as he went . Everything was peaceful . He walked northward , turned west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East Side front . In the sky there were no stars , he could feel a dampness in the raw air . Later on , he flashed his light into doorways , tried a few knobs , saw that everything was O.K.The big clock in the public utilities building struck the quarter-hour . A truck , loaded with the early morning papers , came to a dead stop near the subway entrance and a stocky helper threw off four bundles , big , heavy , whoppingpancakes dumped upon the Fourteenth Street jungle track . In his stall , the newsdealer , a small , fat , cranky blind man in an old cap , counted the papers over , found one short , and began swearing , then counted again . This time the amount was correct , so he took the strings off and put the papers on the stand . Then , filling his lungs with air , a hard , gray , filmy stare in his blind eyes , his brain thinking about something else , he yelled out : " Papeh , papeh , what dya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Window-dressers in felt slippers were already crawling into the shop windows and taking away the displays , gettingready for the big post-Christmas sales . They took down the fake holly wreaths , cotton , silver dust and spoke choppily to each other , their mouths full of pins.  |p189The  dummies they shoved around , getting a kick out of smacking the stylish stout wax models on protruding parts . Signs and cards were hung : " For a limited time only , two dresses for $5 , values up to $35 , buy now . " A few blocks south , broken men were snoring in the 15  --  20  --  3Oc flop-houses ; each man had a tiny booth , sprawled on a hard iron cot , and if he was n't drunk spent most of the night scratching himself until he drew blood . All the mattresses were old , discolored , spattered with years of tobacco stain , nasal excretion , and vomit ; and bedbugs , like systematic squads of marines , scoured each hairy leg and chest . The Yuletide was going on . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all except one single bulb which burned brightly above the doorway near a gilt sign which read : " JESUS SAVES . " Inside , in a corner , the tin cups used for stew were piled up on the floor , and a few feet away the folding chairs were lined up . The twenty-dollar uprightpiano , used for hymn-singing purposes was locked tight , the manager had the key ; it swung from a shiny , silver ring and hung inside his vest near the navel . On the sidewalk in front of the mission , half obliterated by the dampness of the weather , was a passage from the Scripturesprinted in many colors of chalk , red , green , purple , white , and old rose : " WHAT DOTH THE LORD REQUIRE OFTHEE BUT TO LOVE MERCY , DO JUSTICE , AND WALK HUMBLY . . . " Toward midnight the air grew damper , the chalk marks blurred , running together , and all that was visible was " WALK DUMBLY . . . " No more , no less . The three golden balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted . Two old bums stood on the corner . " Where you goin ' ? " the first one said . " Me ? " " Yeah , you . " " I 'm goin '  |p190to  sleep , " the second one answered , and walked into the doorway of the barber-college next door . " Where you goin ' ? " he said , stretching out on the damp tiles , moving his bones around to find a nice , soft tile or two . " I 'm gon na sleep too , " the first one said and ambled up , shuffling his old varicose legs , settling down before his pal . Across the way the bulb burned brightly : " JESUS SAVES . " The light was in their eyes , they turned their rumps toward it . In the west a few beacons on the Jersey City shore twinkled in the darkness . The radio stations began signing off : " Until tomorrow , ladies and gentlemen of our radio audience . Here atop our golden tower of the new giant Goodie-Cookie Building we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodie-Cookies at your neighborhoodgrocery store . Remember , only the best ingredients and utmost care go into each and every cake . Scientists have labored long over this patent formula so that you , madam , and you , sir , shall be protected . Buy a package tomorrow , you wo n't know sorrow . And now , good night , star bright , sleep tight . . . " Midnight came . All the clocks began hammering out the hour , heralding the new day . Twelve bells , twelve o'clock . Like a gray wolf , Christmas slunk from town , running swiftly down the streets , keeping close to buildings . By the time the last thunderous peal had died upon the air , the animal was already near the Battery and , with one last desperate leap , cleared the iron railing and tore on silently , crossing the water rapidly in the fog , running a neck-andneckrace with the fading echo . Pretty soon you could n't see him any more , he was gone  --  swallowed up in mist and darkness . Then two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW YEAR arrived like a fast delivery truck turning a corner on two careening wheels . All at once the big stores began running gigantic , cut-rate sales , slashing prices " to the bone , " putting full-page advertisements in the newspapers , giving the public downright bargains . The citizenry must be served , your majesty the people are our masters . So ran the advertisement copy , printed in tall , black letters followed by many exclamation marks , with drawings of furniture , underwear , hot-water bottles , electric heaters , diapers , and high school suits with two pair of trousers , the seams reinforced at the crotch . In the square , business was also on the boom . Competitionamong the pretzel venders became very keen and bitter , some sold three pretzels for a nickel , but the conservativefaction still clung to the old price , two for five , please buy by me , I need the dough . New articles began to be hawked , Soviet candy in Soviet wrappers , direct from Soviet Russia . At Klein 's a woman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses ; on some days the jams were so fierce there that , when a dame finally procured an empty booth to try on a garment , she found her limbs moist from the struggle , the silk clinging to herp192belly and her back ; but she bought the dress anyway , the price was cheap enough , and no lie . At the north end of the square a new pavilion was going up , cool gray pillars in the Grecian manner . Many people did not know just what kind of a building it would be  --  some said it would turn out an up-to-date hot-dog and orange-juice stand , others felt it would be a public comfort station . " After all , " went the argument , " it 's on the city 's ground , the public must be served . " Turning the corner on two wheels , the new year thus whizzed into sight . Ragged men stood above the subway grating , feeling the warm , dank air flowing up their chilly legs . And now the matinee performances at the burlesk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rafters ; if you did n't buy your ticket early enough , there was only standing room to be had . On the stage the famous HappinessBoys gave the folks their famous Happiness Ditties , crooning softly , giving the house their happy , milliondollar , tooth-paste smiles . Several newspapers began running editorials about the unemployment situation , and a few of them started printingweekly budget lists , showing how an average American family of five could eat fairly substantial food on eight dollars and twelve cents a week . The help-wanted columns dwindled down to a few fake " come-on " ads for agents or canvassers . At the agencies the girls at the desks shook their heads briskly and told you not to trouble yourself making out an application . Folks walked the streets , a man with a steady job was a lucky dog indeed . And into this seething broil of strife and woe came the gentlemen of the platform , unshaven fellows who donned blue or khaki work shirts and harangued from soap-boxes , telling the apathetic people all about the class struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as soon as a man 's voice gave out , another jumped up to take his place . Small crowds of fifty to a hundred stood about and listened : old men , young men , all with blank beaten faces , while on the outskirts a few comrades tried to sell copies of proletarian papers . The raw wind blew dust up the street , while off to one side , at the army recruiting booth , a warmly dressed recruiter walked slowly at his ease . The wind nibbled at the flapping paper poster : GO PLACES , DO THINGS . Under a warm and glowing halftone sky , files of khakied figures marched in order along a Filipino road . Join Now , Service in Foreign Parts . The tall , well-fed recruiterthought about the island climate . He had a yearningfor a nice , hot plate of beans . IIHANK AUSTIN was laid off at the ninth of the month , just as the big sales were climbing to their peaks . A note pinned to his time-card gave Hank his news of freedom . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but at five-fifteen Old Running Water 's office boy went out and pinned four notes upon four time-cards , using metal clips , then came back to read his book again . The clips held the paper to the time-cards firmly . Owing to present business conditions , it is necessary for us to inform you that your services are no longer required as truckman in the receiving department . THE CONSOLIDATED WAREHOUSES . That 's what the notes said , the four of them . Two were carbon copies ; there was no sense for the faithful lad inp194the office to type twice as much as was necessary , when a sheet of carbon lay handy in a drawer . Time went , tick and tock . At five-twenty Old Running Water , a little uneasy under the eyeballs , called the foremaninto the office and told him to take charge of the floor until quitting time . " My kidney trouble again , " explainedthe old gaffer , his glance queasy , his plump hands resting awkwardly upon his hefty thighs . " My kidney trouble again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faking a painful sigh , slipped his overcoat on , grunted , and went out , passing the men who were still rolling the loads from the big freight elevators , not looking at them , staring intently into space , as if contemplating the abstract , or a heavy shipment due to arrive on some vague tomorrow . Back in the office the foreman stood quiet near the Big Chief 's desk . " So four of the boys are getting the air , " he said to the kid , to the lad who now had that nose of his buried into his mystery novel , now that Old Running Water was gone for sure . The youth , reading how the famous detective was out detecting further clews , made no answer . " So the Chief did n't have the nerve to stick around until five-thirty , so he did n't have the guts to face the boys , eh ? " the foreman muttered musingly , hearing the ticking of the office clock , noting that the minute hand was now near the 5 figure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At five-twenty-nine , a gentle gnawing at his bowels , the foreman went to stand in the office doorway , which was five or six feet from the time-card racks . And a minutelater , when the machinery of the clock whirred and clicked inside , he started staring toward the floor . Far down , near the wall to the left , where a huge shipmentof boxed herring and sardines from Norway ( for thep195coming Lenten season ) stood neatly piled , the truckmen came talking and laughing and jostling , heading for the time-clock . The first man , shouting something over his shoulder , punched out with a sharp ping and stuck his card into the OUT rack . The third man , seeing a piece of paper pinned to his card , punched out , then with slow fingers and a fast-going heart took the clip off . . . . The foreman , his eyes downcast , noted the shadow of the fellow upon the floor suddenly go stationary , not wavering or moving an inch . The feeling as if two or three tiny mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four stood behind , looking with burnt-out eyes at the foreman , the others , silent , went down the iron stairway to the street . " Well , boys , " said the foreman , his voice a sympathetic half-mutter , his eyes dead and quiet , " well , boys . . . " and said no more . For a while the four discharged hustlers stood slack beforethe foreman , as if driven into the iron floor , or like four old pier posts standing upright in muddy , sluggish water . Each man held the note between his fingers , feeling the metal clip small and firm against his thumb . The foreman , a post himself , said nothing further , his eyes were drilling futile holes into the floor . Over his shoulder the truckmen could see the empty chair of Old Running Water , the wide empty chair that was smooth and shiny on the seat from years of rump friction . The office kid was placing a leather covering over the typewriter , so that the covered machine resembled a small , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Chief 's desk , and gloom , a blank gloom , settled down upon the office . In half-darkness the four hustlers went toward the iron stairway and started walking down the metal stairs . All of them were a bit gray about the mouth , all were married and had a kid or two . When they reached the street , they stood and looked at the traffic with dead eyes , and mumbled in an undertone a few words about things which were unrelatedand unimportant . They made it a point not to look at one another 's eyes . Five minutes passed like that , just standing there with bowed shoulders , then each man went his own way , not shaking hands , no good-bye , just going off , the muddy , sluggish water finally getting at him , working him loose and carrying him downstream at last . . . . Before he climbed the tenement stairs Hank Austin thought out some words , how he would look at his wife , how and when he would spring the news and the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway , he silently rehearsed his role . The skin on his face felt like dry , old wrapping paper . He made a few faces suddenly , grinned silently , rubbed his cheeks with his paws , set the blood going , then cleared his throat . All set now , he began going up the stairs . There he goes , slowly . The kids , hearing his hand on the knob , get in formationfor the nightly football rush . As soon as Hank opens the door , they run at his knees , growling like bulldogs , and Hank , mighty Hank of the iron shoulder-blades , drags them across the floor like so much seaweed , a funny grin on his face . He even lifts the smallest kid high into the air and speaks a gentle word or two . Then he sets the lad down , throws his leather jacket toward a chair , sits , stretches out his legs , and waits for the meal . His wife , short and sturdy on her healthy legs , bends over the stove , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big dish steaming in her hands , he sees a thin sweat on herp197face , and also a wifely glow . He forces himself to nip her buttocks , when the children are n't looking . Then , reaching out for a tablespoon , he starts swallowing the thick , hot Yankee bean soup , and lifts and swallows , and forces it down , though all appetite is gone forever now . Later on , when the kids got in bed , when it was quiet in the flat , when his missus sat on the other side of the kitchen table , her sleeves rolled to the elbow , Hank wet his lips , but no words came . In the hallway the door banged , the ten-cent lock rattled on the rusty staple , and Hank , forcing himself to look alert , pricked his ears , a coltish gesture , but there was no fire in his eyes , no thunder in his voice now , as he shouted and jerked his head toward the door . His voice died inside his throat , a dry echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakly , as if someone had struck him stunning blows high on his thighs . His wife , her reddened hands mutely folded , the fingers interlocked , sat staring quietly at the pattern on the tablecloth . She was a good woman , and.faithful , too . Hank wet his lips , frowned a bit , but when the missus glanced up he gave a funny grin and moved his great legs slightly , stirring them under the table . One of his boots happened to graze her ankle . " Hank , " she said , getting red all the way down her throat , starting to breathe fast , keeping her eyelids down , her glance on her shiny knuckles . " Hank . " And Hank ? He wet his lips again , but the words stuck in his throat . In the other room the kids were sleeping . The gas-heater burned evenly , the heat flowed pleasantly toward his face . For the last time Hank wet his lips , made an effort . Another funny grin was the result . Then , rising , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | wrapping paper feeling from his face , trying to set his blood pulsing faster . In the end he gave a grunt , and postponedthe matter ; today was Saturday , there was plenty of time yet . Unbuttoning his shirt at the collar , he went to the sink and took a long drink of cold water , and when he set the glass down his wife was still sitting quietly at the table , a modest , faithful dame . Her straight , ash-colored hair was tied in a tight , neat knot in the back of her head , her ears were small and pink ; she sat with her bust touching the edge of the table . Hank planked himself down in a chair and bent away over to untie his shoelaces , grunting as he stooped , wetting his lips , forcing his brain to go forward at a normal pace . " Well , " he grunted , his shaggy head down , his fingers fumbling at his shoes . " Well . . . " he said , and that was all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife rose quietly and turned the gas-heater off . FIVE MINUTES LATER Leon Fisher  --  artist and communist  --  put his overcoat on and clicked out the light in his room , then went downstairs . As he was descending the last few stairs in the hallway , a door under the staircaseopened and Celia came out , walking quietly and rapidly toward the bird-cage , to adjust the cloth . Leon said , " Hello . " " It 's so chilly in the hallway , I thought I 'd come out and see if the canary is covered properly , " said Celia , and she gave him a crooked , childish smile , drawing her lipsp199carefully over that tooth of hers , giving him her sweet , frozen face . Leon , pausing , smiled back at her . He said the bird must be used to the temperature of the house by this time . " Is it a male or a female bird ? " he asked Celia . She turned quickly toward the cage again , and her hands fluttered at the cloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a female , she has such a high voice . . . " Well , females stand the cold better than the males , " said Leon . " That 's a well-known scientific fact . Look at human beings . A man wears an overcoat and shivers while a woman puts on a light silk wrap and does n't feel any-thing . " " It 's not as bad as that . " It was n't , eh ? The little painter gave her more facts , even quoting figures . He had plenty of time to keep a certainappointment , so he could afford to kill a few minutes here in the hall . Speaking authoritatively , he mentioned the fashion plates of certain magazines , which showed the tiny frocks women put on in winter , spoke about the gowns the movie queens wore in their pictures , and , as a crushing blow , called attention to the window displays along FourteenthStreet , " where , " he said , " you could crumble up a lady 's garment into your fist and stuff it into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to say . " However , that 's not what I was thinking about as I closed the door of my room , " Leon went on . No ? " No , " he said . " I was thinking of the chances of my picture at the exhibition being sold and bringing a fair price . "  | The girl whirled suddenly , lifting puzzled brows at him , His picture at the exhibition ? What exhibition ? In a flash Leon realized that he had n't told her about his stroke of luck , he had n't mentioned a word to her about it . And yet , she was the one who had posed for it , had refused the canvasas a gift , and had urged him to send it away . Leon stood there , his face going red , his eyes wandering . " I really do n't know why I did n't tell you , " he said , fumbling about , trying to look at ease before her glance , and he told her that the picture she had posed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would be displayed when the show opened soon . " They sent me a special-delivery letter telling me about it , " he said . The brows shot up , higher . " On Christmas ? " Leon cleared his throat , and coughed gently . Yes , that was it . " My aunt told me you had a letter then , " the girl said . Again Leon coughed gently and stared at the covered bird-cage . Then he remembered something else and the feeling of guilt increased more than ever . " Thanks for the necktie you placed on my dresser , " he said . " It was very nice of you . " " Did you like it ? " He said he did . " That was nothing , " she told him , " but it was all I could afford . " Then it seemed that Leon 's coughing troubled him so much that he had to take his handkerchief from his pocket and place it to his mouth and , flushed in the face , hating himself , he made quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his handkerchief away and startedp201walking grimly , forcing all thoughts out of his mind . He turned up Irving Place and , going south , passed the burlesk show , one eye toward the photos of the undressed ladies , the other on the lights of Fourteenth Street up ahead . Near the box-office the little barker with the hooked nose was croaking hoarsely , as though his throat were lined with coal dust . " You ca n't go wrong folks . . . plenty of young , bee-ootiful girls , dancing , shaking , singing . . . comedy and laughter for old and young . You ca n't go wrong , smoking in boxes . . . " The words of the barker floated behind Leon 's back until he reached Fourteenth Street , where he slowed his pace a little . Finally he came up to the doorway of TwentyDoorCity , stood there hesitating , stood there undecided whether to go in , to stay out , to wait a while , or return back to his room . Finally , dry-throated and with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above the door in the rear he saw a glow against the filmy transom window . He raised a hand and knocked softly . The door opened just a little ; Jose stuck his head out . " Is Helen in , comrade ? " Leon tried to make his voice pleasant . The Mexican , only his head out in the hallway , shook his head vigorously and frowned . " She 's not home , went out somewhere . " Leon felt the man was lying . The big round head of the Mexican continued to stick out into the hall , like a giant sunflower nodding on a stem . " Did you tell her you were coming here ? " Jose said , not asking Leon inside , not actingfriendly . Leon hesitated , then said no  --  no , he was n't expected . " She 's not home  --  not here , " said Jose again , and slammed the door in Leon 's face.  |p202Leon  stood there , feeling small and hollow . He walked toward the entrance and for a while stood looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little by little the lights stopped blurring , until he could distinguish each separate bulb , and then he knew his eyes were dry again . He stood there thinking . Then , because he had nothing to do , because he did not want to return to his room and go to sleep , he re-entered the building and started climbing the flights to Jason 's rooms . On the way up he did a " Hank Austin transformation , " he rearranged his facial musclesas well as he was able . " Where have you been , my proud bee-ooty ? " said theex-poet , who was scanning a draft of a story he was thinking of sending out . " I have n't seen you for over a weeknow , Comrade Leon . " " I had to do some Party work , ' said Leon . " It kept mepretty busy . " " You 're a liar , Leon . You 've been on the hop , skip , andjump for that comrade down on the main floor , for thatdizzy blonde . " Leon 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face . The ex-poet 's f ace was set . " Why walk five flights up where you can be entertainedon the ground floor ? That is the question , Comrade Leon , the big issue that confronts us here . I grant you the floor , you may answer at your leisure , ' and he turned to scanhis typed sheets again . Leon did n't answer , did n't say a word , did n't sit down , though Jason had motioned to a chair . Finally , no wordscoming forth , the ex-poet glanced up  --  " Down below you could have listened to sweet laughter and viewed a pair of twinkling dimples and also dimpled can , twinklings , you know what I m comrade ; she surep203has a pair of dimpled twinklings and I do n't mean maybe , while up here you have only my sour face to gaze upon . " Leon , hurt , did n't know what to do now , Jason had never gone as far as this before . Staring about , he saw a mouse trap near a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " he observed , " I have become troubled lately by nocturnal prowlings . Yesterday I caught two visitors , little fellows they were , with nice , sensitive tails . Today I trapped one . Business , you see , is not good , not so bad . " " Is bread good bait ? " asked Leon , glad that his friend was off on another subject now . The trap had a bread pellet . The ex-poet raised his brows . Good bait ? Why , he himselfate the bread , it was so good . " What kind does the blond Venus eat ? Bread made from golden dough , or does she prefer muffins ? " Leon crept further within himself . Why Jason was hurting him so much , he did n't know . " Unless you stop talking like that , I 'll have to leave , " he finally told the ex-poet . " Go ahead , " answered Jason , " but do n't slam the door , my nerves are sensitive tonight , I have just completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York , gets a job in a speakeasy , and finally marries Dick Hathaway , son of the Macedonian consul , who is off on a spree from Bulgaria . They meet in a coffee-pot on Eighth Avenue . However , I might have to revise my tale a bit , maybe I did n't make Miranda hot enough for the editor , and you ca n't blame the editor if he turns the epic down . Who wants a cold woman , anyhow ? I should have made Miranda like Comrade Helen , a big , hot baby . " Now Leon 's mouth was twitching , his legs were quiver- ing too . He whirled around and gripped the doorknob and was going out when Jason 's voice rang out with a clear command . " Here , you ! Sit down , come back here ! " Leon , still quivering , closed the door and sat down quietly . Jason , his face changing , laid the sheets aside and stared toward an empty bottle on the floor ; when he spoke to Leon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you 're making a fool of yourself . I hear you 're calling on the blonde downstairs almost every day when the greaser 's not around and you 're hanging around her like a puppy . Believe me , Leon , she 's not worth it , she 's just a stuffed doll with the face of a simple farmer girl . I 'll admit she 's got a body , if you like that kind of a shape , but she 's too big for you to tackle , and besides , I doubt if she 'd hand herself over to you . She 's playing with you , kidding you along . " Leon 's heart was hammering hard , going like a triphammeragainst his ribs . " You ought to stop chasing her before she gets too strong a hold on you , " Jason said . Then the little fellow found his voice , words spurted from his mouth as from a fountain pen . " And what about yourself ? " he demanded harshly , two spots showing on his cheeks . " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she threw you down . How can you talk and adviseme , how do you have the nerve to do so ? " He shrilled the last words . " I do n't count , " said Jason . " And anyway , the girl did n't wreck me , she tried to build me up , but there was nothing there to build up . " " You 're a liar , " screamed Leon from his chair . " No , " said Jason calmly , " I 'm not , " and he smiled ,  |p205one  of his rare smiles that touched his bitter mouth with something that wrenched at Leon 's heart . " I 'm your friend , " said Jason . " Do n't forget that . " Leon sat there . He pulled out his handkerchief and blew his nose violently . Jason turned his head and for a long time stared off at some sheets of paper on the bed . When he turned around , Leon was all right again , smiling faintly , calmed down , but his eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I came up for , " said Leon after a pause , " was to ask you to go with me to a meeting a week from next Sunday . It 's going to be held across the street , at Webster Hall . " Jason said he was n't interested . " But this is n't strictly a Party meeting , " Leon argued . " This is a mass meeting , the public is going to be invited . It 's about the striking miners down in Kentucky . " Again Jason said he was n't interested . " I 'll be around anyway , " said Leon , getting ready to go , and stood at the doorway , staring at the face of his friend , sorry he had touched the ex-poet 's sore spot . " That room across the hall , " he said , making conversation , " is it rented yet , did someone take it ? " " Rent that room ? Do n't make me laugh . Why , it 's colder there than here . Who 'd want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your gin would freeze there if you rented it , " Leon said , starting to smile . Gin ? Jason was sober now , his cash was all gone , his bill at Pete 's was very big and for the past few days all the ex-poet had ordered was doughnuts and coffee because Pete had stood there clawing thoughtfully at the cheese holes of his leathered face , clearing his throat , hesitating to speak on a topic very tender to both of them . " No , I'mp206not interested in gin right now , " said Jason to Leon . " I 'm thinking of taking a bus trip , just for a change of climate . Maybe I 'll go down to Philadelphia , I do n't know yet . " " If you go there next week , you can drop in at the Academy and see my picture , " Leon said . Jason snorted . " Your picture ? Who the hell told you you could paint ? I could do better drawing with my left hand . How did it get in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll count on your coming to that meeting , " he said before he left . " I 'll come up here and call for you . The admission is only twenty-five cents . " " Twenty-five cents ! I can buy four cans of beans for that . No , do n't trouble yourself , comrade . Twenty-five cents ! I can get three pairs of socks for that . Nope , not for me . " Jason was still shouting as Leon closed the door , but when it was shut his face changed , his voice dropped , and he stared thoughtfully at the sheets of paper scattered about on the cot . In the hallway Leon was going down the stairs , feeling pretty good again . He took the narrow turnings slowly , the steps were treacherous . He knew the building . When he reached the ground floor , he did n't look back in the rear but continued on his way , heading for the entrance , and when he reached the front door he saw a graymustachedman with a worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that moment Sid Turner came up to the building , Sid Turner who was a good friend of Leon 's . Sid was a nice , quiet fellow . They stood talking in the hallway , in the entrance of the tenement . " Just coming from Helen ? " said Sid sociably . Leon , his head going into his shoulders , tried to changep207the subject . He said he had just come from Jason 's place . Sid looked at Leon quickly , queerly . " Helen was expectingyou . Just before I left the flat about an hour ago , she said you told her you were coming over . Did n't you have an appointment with her , Leon ? " Now the little fellow was trapped , his eyes took on that strange , dry fire again . He wet his lips , opened up his mouth . " I did knock , but Jose said she was n't in . " " Was that you who knocked about an hour ago ? " Leon nodded . Across the street the lights of Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words reached Leon faintly , as through a windstorm . " Jose told us that the agent was in the hallway asking for the rent . He said he told the agent to come around to-morrow . " Then Sid saw that Leon had begun to shiver . " Say , " he said , " you 're cold , you 'd better come inside and warm up for a while , " and he took the little fellow by the arm . But Leon , his face horribly distorted now , wrenched himself away , and , emitting a short , hoarse cry , started running up the street . At the corner he passed the gray-faced man with the gray mustache and in his haste almost stepped upon the yapping dog . MR . BOARDMAN , seeing Leon going by , gave the strap a tug , and the dog , bracing its legs , calmed down , growling in a smothered fashion . When Mr. Boardman jerked gently at the strap again , the animal trotted meekly at his heels.  | Reaching the entrance of the Glen Cove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs he wet his lips and in the hallway practiced smiling a few times . Then he walked up the stairs , carrying the dog under his arm . Margie , in pale blue pajamas , was stretched out on the sofa , belly down , reading a confessional magazine and smoking a cigarette from a long ivory holder . Mr. Boardmanclosed the door quietly , set the animal down , then took his hat and coat off . The small dog trotted around the room , dragging his strap , and began yapping shrilly . " Dodo must n't , " said Margie , not looking away from the magazine , not taking her mind off the story , only her lips moving . " Dodo must n't . " She grew irritated quickly if her reading was interrupted . Right now she was in the thick of the story , right in the spot where Bruce McCrae has June out in a lonely shack and starts taking off June 's one-piece bathing suit , when the honking of an automobile sounds faintly from down the road near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes were racing on ahead , she wanted to find out if Bruce succeeds in taking off that onepiecebathing suit . The dog kept on yapping . " Boardie , " she shouted , bouncing up , her face going livid . " Boardie , throw that goddamed hound out the window . Throw him out or cut his neck with the bread-knife . Shut him up ! " Mr. Boardman came forward , bent down , picked up the animal , patted the little head , stroked the silken ears , and soon the doggie was grinning , his mouth open , his tongue lolling out contentedly like a maple leaf in an April breeze . Mr. Boardman took him into the bedroom and placed him upon the deep , soft hide of the polar bear near the bed . The dog lay silent , still grinning as Mr. Board/man went out . Mr. Boardman closed the bedroom door quietly . Margie , her stare hard upon the print ahead , spoke , hardly moving her lips . " You saw I was reading , you knew damn well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was taking my coat off , dear . The dog is quiet now . " Margie finished the story . The auto had raced up the road just in time , just as the stitches of June 's bathing suit were beginning to rip . In the auto had been Tom Holliday , one-time football star at Princeton . It was a fairly good story . Reaching out , moving her arms and yawning , Margie took the cigarette from the holder and slowly crushed the burning end of it against the polished top of the expensive mahogany table . She knew that Boardie was watching . When she looked up , however , he was staringat the rug . She yawned slowly , stretching like a leopard , feeling nice and lazy . " I feel rotten lately , " she said , yawning again . " I get the blues so damned often now , I do n't know what 's the matter with me . All I feel like doing is swearing all day . Honest to Christ , that 's the way I feel lately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe we should have taken in a show tonight , " said Mr. Boardman , staring thoughtfully at the polished points of his shoes . " I could have phoned for the tickets . " " Shows , hell . We do n't see any people , that 's the trouble . We have no friends . " Mr. Boardman winced a bit . " But it was your wish that we live quietly , " he said . " Well , I 'm sick and tired of it now . My wishing days are over . " " You yourself said you did n't care to meet my friends . You said you knew you would n't like them . "  | " And I have n't changed my mind either . But why ca n't we get in touch with some live people ? Why ca n't we step out once in a while with a crowd , with a party ? " Mr. Boardman did not know any lively folks  --  folks suited to Margie 's temperament . He told her so , speaking quietly , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his trousers . Margie , lighting a fresh cigarette , said that was n't her fault . There was a pause . " We could go out some time with your friend Daisy , " Mr. Boardman said , his glance still averted . He had no use for Daisy , and this concession cost him quite an effort . Margie had been waiting for the news . " Daisy used to be my best friend , " she said . " It was n't her fault she got mixed up in that hotel suicide last summer . She 's a swell kid . " " All right , " said Mr. Boardman , " we could go out with her and her gentleman friend some time then . " There was another long pause . " I have n't seen Daze for a long time , " said Margie , musing . Later on , feeling peppy , she rose from the sofa , and , with the thin transparent material of the pajamas flappingabout , she executed a few steps of a tap-dance , a relic of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks grew rosy , then , breathless , slid onto Boardie 's knees and started kissing and biting his face , stroking back his iron hair , murmuring baby-talk , pulling his ears , and , in short , making him feel cozy-cozy . Then she jumped up , went into the pantry for tall glasses , and made highballs . They drank drink after drink , Mr. Boardman sipping slowly , feeling the rooms blur ; and pretty soon the drunken girl on his knee began tellingp211disgusting stories , one right after another , but his brain was not clear enough to revolt against them ; at the telling of the filthiest tale his brain cleared for the fraction of a second and suddenly he thought of his sixteen-year-old daughter , remembering faintly that the last three letters from Milly had not been answered yet ; he was always postponing it , he would write her from the office in the morning . But when the next day came , he did not write . He did not write because the day was Sunday , because he had a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper out of the drawer and have Margie looking over his shoulder . He sat around reading the Sunday papers . Margie made a long-winded telephone call and late in the afternoon , when Daisy and her gentleman friend came over for a little social visit , Mr. Boardman felt more than ever that he was waging a losing fight . VDOWN THE BLOCK the owner of the small Hungarian restaurant stood waiting in the rear of the store , cracking his fingers nervously , his hands behind his back . He had very dry joints , and if he waited another half-hour he could make the cracking sounds all over again . Pretty soon a big man with his hat pulled low entered the store and slammed the door shut with a bang . He carried a long black suitcase , the weight of which pulled his left arm down . " Anybody here ? " the big man asked , looking around , his eye hard upon the Hungarian . " Only my wife , in the kitchen . "  | The big man grunted , went behind the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , there 's no business on Sunday anyway . " The Hungarian walked toward the front of the store , drew the dark curtain across the window of the door , then shot the brass bolt into place . When he returned , he went to stand behind the counter in the rear where the big man was staring thoughtfully into the large , black grip . " How did the stuff go ? " the big fellow asked gruffly . The Hungarian did n't answer right away , so the big man had to repeat the question . " Well , how 'd it go , how 'd the stuff go ? " " All right . But I 'm starting to feel nervous now . " The big man gave a short laugh . " You began it , you ca n't back out now . Here , I 've got some other stuff for you now . This sells for a dime more a shot , but it 's better stuff , the trade wo n't kick . " He held up a quart bottle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right from Cuba , it do n't come better . " Out of sight , standing stocky in the kitchen , the Hungarian'swife heard every word and stood twisting the edge of her apron . In her small , brown eyes there was a frightened glaze , as if a bug were about to drop down her neck from the ceiling . " You got to talk to the trade more , " she heard the big man telling her husband . " Do n't be afraid to tell ' em you 're handling the stuff , they all want it . It 'll mean more business for the restaurant too , you 'll be making gravy from both ends then . Get me ? " " But maybe I should n't handle so much so soon . " The big man , taking out the bottles , laughed a short , hard laugh . After that , the Hungarian decided to do very little talking.  | " I 'll be around Friday night , " the big man said , strikinga match to his cigar . A curl of bluish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff goes , do n't be afraid to tell the trade . After the first week you wo n't have to talk to them , they 'll do all the asking . Well , I 'll be seein ' you . " The Hungarian walked with him toward the front and unbolted the door . Cold air hit him square in the face . The wide back of the big man , going up the street , seemed very broad and compelling indeed . About forty feet away or so a long blue car was parked . The limousine started off with a powerful sputter , like an airplane motor . The Hungarian , bolting the door again , came back and hid the bottles in a packing case behind the counter , hiding them carefully . He placed another case on top of the first one . Then he went toward the front again and , breathing easier , lifted the shade at the door and released the bolt . Just as he was finished , a fellow who roomed a few doors away came in , a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and muttered a few words into the Hungarian 's ear . The Hungarian , not used to it yet , nodded nervously and came back with a tumbler filled to the top , good measure . The customer tossed it off , smacked his lips , then was ready for the soup . In the kitchen the owner 's wife , with an unsteady hand , was poking the roast around in the big pot . When the customer was gone , the Hungarian went back there and stood over the pots sniffing , from habit . Now that the store was empty again , his wife stopped twisting the edge of her apron . She had a broad , faithful face , was sturdily built , and before coming to America had worked in the fields on her father 's land . Darkness came on , the arc lamp outside lit up . Neither spoke for a long while . Finally the Hungarian lifted the lid from the pot again , sipped the gravy with puckered lips , then sprayed salt over it and stirred with a big spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both stood , though there were a few boxes in the rear to sit upon . In the end the Hungarian began pacing the store again , pausing up in front , where he could see the arc lamp swaying in the wind outside . The light shone against the quartered windowsof the Catholic school , and the building rose huge and solid in the wintry dusk . Placing his hands behind his back , he began exerting pressure again and pretty soon was rewarded with a dry cracking sound . In the kitchen he spoke to his wife , his head away from her . " You can buy Vincent that pair of shoes tomorrow . And while you 're at it , you can buy yourself a pair of woolen drawers you said you needed . Go to the marketplace , you get things cheaper there . " He spoke in Hungarian , in a low , subdued voice . Meek and stolid , her round , dull face as expressionless as a peasant listening to the village priest , the woman stared at her husband 's cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEW BLOCKS farther north the cracked printer was talking to Pete about the maneuverings of the ancient Roman legions . His left eyelid jerked , and in his excitementthe coffee ran in a thin stream from a corner of his mouth , like pale tobacco juice . " In Justinian 's time the legions developed a new mode of attack , " the printer said . " They devised the frontalp215formation , bringing both ends of the column round like the corners of a handkerchief , thus surrounding the enemies . Like this , " and he took an old soiled rag from his pocket , a rag used for wiping ink from type and rubber rollers . " The center withstood the attack while the ends went swiftly around and encircled the foe . Of course , it took a lot of training and did n't always work . " Pete scratched his forearm , the rash was gone  --  sites of old wounds . He was tired of the fellow 's twaddle , but by now had perfected a front of his own : he knew how to stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " While making the attack the men stand shoulder to shoulder , so that their shields present an unbroken front , " the printer said . " The enemies ' spears bounced off like toy arrows , it was like a pup biting at a big turtle 's back . " The front door opened , a man came in for doughnuts and coffee . The printer , taking a piece of paper from an innerpocket , began drawing diagrams . He made squares and circles and at the bottom drew the four points of the compass . All the while , his left eyelid was jerking . With his free hand he fumbled in another pocket and brought out three more pencil stubs , all of different colors . Pete was pouring the customer a second cup of the Crystal Lunchroom'sfamous coffee and stood on his thin , bowed legs , staring at the iron supports of the elevated outside . For Sunday business was fair , as usual ; he had had a slight run on meat-balls in the early afternoon . Feeling his pockmarkedface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or maybe a pork chop with beans and mashed on the side . He thought the matter over . In the rear the jumpy dish-washer broke a plate on the floor and began coughing loudly , trying to hide the fact . Pete heard.  | " Was it a dinner plate ? " he asked in a clear voice , in a clear , loud , ringing voice . A pause . . . then came the mumbled answer . The old man 's shiny , bluish skull shot out the wicket . " It was a small saucer , boss , one of those small ones . It had a crack in it , anyway . " The cook cackled , out of sight , and waited for the boss to fly off the handle . Nothing happened , Pete was calm about it . After that , the old man took more care , and gave a whining smile toward the dirty floor . The cook , grouchy and disappointed , rattled his pans harder than ever . " The frontal flank formation is the only method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of practice . A united front , that 's the best thing , " and he drew a few more circles with a colored pencil . The customer down the counter finished the second cup of coffee , picked up , with his fingernails , the last few crumbs on the plate from the two crullers , wiped his lips with his palm , got up and paid the bill . The cash register went ping ; Pete shut the drawer smartly . The . Down the block the dime-movie house was showing two features , a gangster film and a western , see how Hickey Savo and his gang could not outwit the fighting state 's attorney , also Buck Jones riding , shooting , and rounding up the hoss thieves in GUARDING THE RANGE , a fast-moving thriller of the days that was . In the box-office , which was the size of a miniature outhouse , a hefty dame of fifty winters ( her hennaed hair frizzled and burnt around the edges ) sat upon a hard , oaken stool , and shifted position , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cheek , giving all her teeth a chance . At five-minute intervalsthe boss came out , a small , bandy-legged man with a pot belly and a dark mustache , and he looked up and downp217the street for customers , his nostrils twitching , but the street ( Third Avenue ) was dead and gloomy . Dusk settledover the city , a wintry gloom . Inside the smelly movie the sixty patrons yawned and nodded . Most of them were sitting through the show for the third and fourth time , not looking at the screen  --  a dime was cheap to rest your bones . By this time Daisy and her gentleman friend had arrived at the Boardman apartment a few blocks south . They took their hats and coats off and started to make themselvesat home . Margie and Daisy had n't seen each other for a long time , so they had a lot to talk about , and stood there , bright-eyed , speaking quickly , brittlely and with due length , while the men , all out of it , sat quiet , occasionallyglancing at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a stubby , stocky German of fifty , bald , but with plenty of coal-black hair over his ears . His mild eyes , set in a heavy Teutonic face , stared vacantly about , and his wide , meaty hands rested plump upon his knees . He wore a black suit , a dark blue tie , and a hard collar ; a conservative , trustylookingman . In his lapel a small yellow rose stood out , firm and wax-like , with a pert tilt to its head . Mr. Boardmanlearned , later on , that Herr Blatz was in the pictureframingbusiness . " I have sixteen men working in my shop , " Mr. Blatz said later on . " A year ago I have over forty men . People do n't buy so much pictures now . " The girls , through gassing , sat down all gassed out . They looked alike , only Daisy 's hair was dyed a flaming red . Both were tall , slim , firmly fleshed , and had long , slender legs . Conversation was hard getting started ( this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gassing again , proddedp218it on , and the men dropped a few words now and then , flatvoiced , just sitting there , trying to look and act pleasant . Finally , at five-thirty , when darkness had at last settled fully over the town  --  like a magician 's black cloak over a table of apples  --  when the demented printer had gone to his Thirteenth Street basement abode to write in his journal of the frontal flank formation , when Pete 's old dish-washer ( his seamy face steamed up from the hot suds ) took time out to gnaw a sandwich ( he had four teeth left in his mouth )  --  at that time , Margie rose to her slim , sinewy height , her cool , maddening height , walked over to the phone on her high sixteen-dollar heels , and called up a swanky delicatessen store over on University Place and gave the gent at the other end of the wire a juicy order . Mr. Boardman , listening , stirred slightly in his chair . Twenty minutes later a delivery boy ( coming on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ) , a lad with a starched white jacket , brought up quite a heavy basket filled with varied kinds of food , a whole roast chicken , olives , celery , jam , rye bread , cookies , and a lot of other items . Mr. Boardman , rising , dug into his pocket . The lad put the money away slowly , hanging around , looking at the floor . Mr. Boardman gave him a coin . In the kitchen the girls were getting a kick out of fussingaround , preparing the supper . They twittered above the food like a couple of canary birds . Just a night at home , an evening of comfy , wholesome home life to warm the cockles of yer ' eart . In the living room the men sat quietly , listening to the talking , the giggling , the heel-rapping of the girls . Mr. Blatz , a man with a roving eye , was a bit puzzled atp219the blackened spots all over the wooden arm-rests of the chairs and also on the tables . The furniture looked to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the blackened spots remained . Mr. Boardman , glancing away , was coughing gently . In the kitchen , more shrill talk , more giggling . " Do you eat uptown or downtown ? " Mr. Boardman said at last , being amiable . Mr. Blatz , who liked Mr. Boardman the instant they had met , said sometimes he ate downtown , sometimes he ate uptown . " It depends on what calls I have to make . " At that , Mr. Boardman gave Mr. Blatz his card and invitedMr . Blatz to take luncheon with him whenever he came downtown . " I 'll phone you first , " said Mr. Blatz , holding the card between his fingers . " It is n't necessary , " said Mr. Boardman pleasantly . " Just drop in around one o'clock , I 'm in at that hour . " Mr. Blatz , putting the card away and making up his mind that he would like to dine with Mr. Boardman , said that he would do so . The girls came in , carrying food . The meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodded the talk on , trying to get a real hilarious feeling going , but the men sat there like patient steers , their horns lowered in quiet stolidity . The table they sat at was small , and it was crowded eating there , and Mr. Boardman , because the girls had forgotten a few items , had to make frequent trips to the kitchen to get them . Mr. Blatz , a healthy man , had a healthy appetite . The small sandwiches and knickknacks of food went into his mouth like a disappearing act , his heavy jaw moved up ,  |p220down  , up , down ; and the food was gone ; on both sides of his forehead was a powerful , swelling , chewing movement , like that of a horse . The drinks followed . Daisy , who was an expert , knew a new combination highball and did a bit of scientific pouring . Marge , not to be outdone , shook the cocktail shaker for a good five minutes , and served cocktails . Mr. Blatz , who liked wine with White Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much ; still , the drinks were pretty fair ; he drank them . Again he rubbed a moist thumb over a blackened spot on the arm of his chair , but the burnt surfaceremained ; he could n't figure it out . When the eating and the drinking was over , when everybodyfelt a full , a tingling feeling somewhere near the navel , when Herr Blatz and Mr. Boardman complimented the girls on their supper , dead-voiced , flatly-pleasant , tryinghard , though , they sat around the dirty dishes , and the girls started putting their cigarette butts into the coffee cups , into the half-filled cups . The girls hinted that they were tired , so the men rose ( Mr. Blatz grunting ) and together both men carried the dishes back to the kitchen and piled them in the sink while the girls sat around . The maid was due tomorrow . From then on the evening dragged very much indeed . The men , seeing each other 's counterpart in each other 's eyes , noting that the girls were alike in face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not look cheerful . They tried , but failed . Middle age was in their bones , old age was coming on . One thought about his daughter , the other about the picture-framing business . To liven things up Margie put a record on the phonograph , and the girls started dancing , but it was hard going on account of the carpet , on account of the heavy ,  |p221thoughtful  faces of the men , on account of everything , so Margie , glaring toward Boardie , shut the machine off . The evening passed somehow . The hard , brittle faces of the girls were offset by the sad , lost countenances of the men . The evening was a flop , irritation crept into Margie 's face like a rash . Toward the end she started talking harshly , loudly to her friend Daisy , cutting words and phrases , remarks about bedroom slippers by the old fireside , old age , early-to-bed and early-to-rise . Mr. Boardman , his face going gray , rose from his chair and walked slowly toward the front windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His back quivered . Down below a file of cabs was dragging by , the lights of Webster Hall blazed on the street . Finally Mr. Blatz , who was a man of honor , whose round face had been growing gradually pink at Margie 's words , coughed three or four times , warning coughs . Daisy gave Margie the eye immediately , she knew the danger signals . Margie took the hint and , winded and blowing , . stopped her talking . From then on the flat was decently quiet and Mr. Boardman came back from the windows and sat down again . Soon after , the visitors left , it was getting late . Mr. Blatz , his brown eyes going hard , had been staring intentlyat Daisy for some time . Margie got their hats and coats , Mr. Boardman rose , and all went toward the door . The girls kissed quickly , Marge whispering rapid words into Daze 's ears when the men were n't looking . Shaking of hands , words and talk , the open hallway , the yawning stairs below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something to Mr. Blatz , and Mr. Blatz was waiting , but all at once the girls stiffened , alert , and Mr. Boardman merely coughed gently behind his hand.  |p222As  the door closed , however , Mr. Boardman felt quite sure that Mr. Blatz would call up to take lunch with him some time soon . " That Dutchman gives me a pain , " Margie said as soon as they were alone . " How Daze stands him , I do n't know . He ought to be behind the counter selling pork chops . " " I thought he was a very pleasant man , " said Mr. Boardman . " He spoke pleasantly while he was here . " " The hell he did . Why , he did n't speak at all , he sat there like an old cow , that 's what he did . " " I could find nothing wrong with him , " Mr. Boardman said . Five minutes later a real argument was going , Margie firing shells on all fronts , Mr. Boardman 's lines making no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Boardman grew afraid the neighbors would complain . Across the hall Vanya and Natasha , their ears glued to the door , were listening . Once more Mr. Boardman stood at the front windows , his back toward the flat , his head bowed as he stared down upon the street . Margie kept hollering until he faced around and , when he did so , she took her burning cigarette and put it out against the small mahogany end-table , the one he had bought just last week , the one which had no black marks on it as yet . Turning her wrist vigorously , like the heel of a boot grinding out the life in a worm , she ground the fiery end of the butt into the polished wood and whirled toward him , her face grim . Mr. Boardman said nothing . His silence infuriated her . She began shoutinglouder than ever , her hands stiff at her sides , clenching and unclenching her fists , then started striding up and back and finally , shouting , " I 'm going nuts in this goddamnedflat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep223bedroom . When she came out , she was fiercely shoving her arms into her overcoat sleeves . She slammed the door . Mr. Boardman could hear her going rapidly down the steps of the hallway . When he thought she must have reached the entrance door , he stared from the front windows again , waiting . Pretty soon he saw her down below . He saw her cross the street in a hurry , shake the sleepy arm of a taxi driver , then step inside the cab . He saw the chauffeur 's arm reach out , then heard the door bang shut . A second later Mr. Boardman saw the cab roll briskly up the street . THE NEXT day dawned clear and cold . At half-past seven Grandma Volga and Mr. Feibelman , running a neckand-neckrace all the way from First Avenue , arrived at the square in a dead-heat , and there ensued one of the fiercest battles along the turbulent Fourteenth Street frontier . Grandma Volga , breathing hoarsely from the sprint ( she was an oldish dame , a wheezy mare that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Grandma Volga emptied all her Russian invectives square upon the chestnutvender 's round fedora and in the end had to resort to spittle , but in vain . By a clever maneuver ( leave it to Mr. Feibelman ! ) , the chestnut vender had gained his objective , and none too soon . As the traffic light changed , both had rushed forward over the cobbles , wheeling their carts at a breakneck pace toward the coveted position near the main B.M.T. subway entrance , keeping neck and neck , pretty winded now , their eyes bright with battle asp224the prize loomed near ; and then Mr. Feibelman , gatheringhis loins together , as the saying goes , taking a deep breath of the Monday morning air of Union Square , heaved the front wheels of his little wagon over the curbingand , with one last , heroic shove , his trained hands directing , pushed the wagon forward on its oiled wheels , and the cart rolled snugly into place , a split second before his rival 's entry . It was a bit of slick strategy . Sweatingand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statue of the Frenchman : " Lafayette , I am here , " he seemed to say , this vender of the cart marked CheTnutZ . The greenish bronze sword of Lafayette , poised in a stiff , frost-bitten gesture , grinned back at Mr. Feibelman . Officer Terence McGuffy , rounding out the last halfhourof his night-beat , came over to see what the squabble was about , came over to settle any disputes among the venders in his charge . He came swinging his nightstick behind his back as he sauntered over , a good , husky lad with a seventeen-inch collar . In his belly was a pretty fair remnant of a midnight snack ( eaten at Thompson 's ) , three cups of hot coffee , and two ham sandwiches , also a big rosy apple " donated " by an early-bird apple vender when dawn had come marching clear and cold over the iron-hooved town . In a trice the dispute was settled , the authoritative figure of the cop squelched all boisterousness . Grumbling , rubbing her purple gums together in a mumble , Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer a nice , twisted pretzel , one with a lot of hard salt sprinkled on it . Mr. Feibelman , hunting suddenly in his pot , finally came across with a couple of nuts ( slightly burnt , but then , he had the burnt sides turnedp225the other way ) , and McGuffy took both offerings . The woman and the little man watched him walking off , and after the cop had gone thirty paces Grandma Volga whirled fiercely , and made an unclean gesture , and spat , and Mr. Feibelman , gazing mildly across the now surging square , murmured a short prayer to himself , wondering how long the old woman would live ; he put some newspaper in the tin bucket and started the fire . Across the street the citizenry were being treated to the sight of a newcomer , The Man Who Walks Backwards . A crowd followed the fellow , even the cops stopped and stared . Tapping a stout , blackened cane against the sidewalk , a lean-faced man of forty was walking backwards at a pretty natural and rapid pace ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of confidence in his ability and kept on going backwards . Even the blind beggars in the block were somewhat astonished . The newcomer wore strange-looking spectacles , horn-rimmed glasses with neat , tiny mirrors adjusted to them , so that he could see where he was going . On his back , which faced you as he came your way , was pinned a sign : THE MANWHO WALKS BACKWARDS , ALL THE WAY FROM LOS ANGELESLIKE THIS . And beneath this legend was a small metal cup . People started dropping coins inside it . And even when he paused to stare at shop windows , his back faced the displays , and a little kid , looking up , looking puzzled , tugged at his mama 's sleeve and asked , " Mama , does the man eat backwards , mama , does he sleep backwards , too ? " His mother hushed him , life was puzzling enough for her the way things were . Officer McGuffy , munching on a pretzel , sauntered over and looked the newcomer up and down , down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away.  | The Man Who Walks Backwards , a thin-lipped smile on his lean , clean-shaven face , hesitated for the fraction of a second each time a good dame made ready to open her purse . The coins , mostly nickels , hit the bottom of the cup with a clink . Over the iron-hooved town the day was marching . Clear and cold it came . Folks flowed by in a heavy , Mondaymorningtide , going toward the stores , the subway entrances , or merely killing time by walking to and fro . The dime movies had not yet thrown open their proud portals to the eager patrons , the five-and-ten-cent stores were not yet due to welcome the mob until nine-thirty . Up and down the crowds went , tramp , tramp , tramp . Every time a subway train came to a halt below , you could hear the roar of wheels coming through the iron grating of the sidewalk . Porters were washing the windows of Luchow 's , the refuse trucks were hoisting up big cans of garbage from the restaurants . On Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important announcement against the front windows , informing the gentry that for 30c a veal cutlet and two vegetables could be had , served in that famous Crystal Lunchroom manner with plenty of gravy seething all over the plate and maybe some of it overflowing onto your pants ; be careful . Smoke from big buildings hung above the rooftops . Over the town rolled the roar and petty strife of millions . Merchants slashed their prices for the trade , workers took cuts in wages to hold onto their jobs , girls without families who had to meet their room rent or get thrown out upon the street stayed a little later in the offices if the bosses demanded it , stayed to take " dictation " and swallowed hard , and made no outcry , there in the darkness , when the boss clicked the lights out . There was stiff competition onp227all fronts , selling out below cost , come in and look around , last few days , please let me go , Mr. Goldman , please , please , please , oh , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed on and off . The flavor lasts . In the square , at the orange-juice stand , the attendant , casting a sharp glance around , bent over and poured a gallon of pure cold water into the hold , then stirred the contents with a wooden ladle ; a few wisps of orange peel , like small , dead fishes , floated slowly to the surface . Putting on an honest look , the attendant wiped his hands , drew a deep breath and shouted : " Orange drink , orandri ' , or-range , fi-ive cents here , hot frank on a ro-oll , fi-ive cents here , gettum while they 're hot , or-range , orange ! " The clock in the tall tower of the public utilities buildingstruck eight times , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong . Officer Terence McGuffy , his mind alert , counted . Eight times it was . Tightening his belt , he swung across the street , free from duty now , an easy , offdutysmile on his faithful , beefsteak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron phone box near the bank , knocked off work , called up , and , waving his hand leisurely at another cop coming from the opposite corner , turned his broad , smooth back and sauntered from the square , the blare and noise striking the rear of his head like little , playful , cotton balls . At eight-thirty Hank Austin , discharged from duty Saturday last , was still walking aimlessly around the square , a hollow , beaten feeling in his Yankee bones . He had said good-bye to his wife and kids in the customarymanner , as if leaving for work , and by the time he was going down the stairs of the tenement he himself half-believed that he still had a job , that he was due to punch IN soon , due to slam and expertly dump the boxes around , due to say hello to the boys and maybe catch a look of Old Running Water coming in , trailed by a curl of thin , blue cigar smoke like a thinnish piece of silk over those fat , plump shoulders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began walking up the street , half-believing he still had a job . Millions were out of work , but he still had a job . He swung along . But by the time he covered a full block he knew damn well he could n't fool himself any longer , and , his chest growing suddenly heavy , his great legs started dragging , his shoulders sank . People walked by , heading for the square . Some were in a hurry , a lot had plenty of time . The heaviness crept up his limbs like a chill , as if he were wading in some kind of deepening water and pretty soon the cold feeling was in his thighs and climbed on higher . Shoving his hands deep into his pockets , Hank walked along . Over the iron-hooved town the day was marching . The square now swarmed with people , every sidewalk was crowded . Women , on their way to the big East Side markets , carried shopping bags , salesmen held briefcases under their arms , affecting a jaunty pre-depression , Americanmanner , and waitresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street and entered the tiled doorway . A big special was running today , roast turkey sandwichwith cranberry sauce , accompanied by our famous chick-peas . In the window a neat jane was neatly flapping flapjacks . Hank Austin , waiting for the traffic lights like the others , crossed over with the flowing tide and surged high and dry upon the other sidewalk . The early morning sunlight struck the forehead of George Washington 's powerful charger with a sharp shaft of golden light . A white-wing , using his brush energetically ( it was Monday morningp229and the supervisor was due to come coasting along in his Ford any minute now ) , sent a cloud of dust rolling toward the horse 's eyeballs , but the steed did n't bat a lash . " Come what may , " he seemed to say , this charger with the swelling buttocks . Again the big clock in the tower bonged , a solemn tone . Time and tide wait for no man , the traffic lights changed once more , the big thick minute hand clicked forward . Never put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raised in the public schools , felt the heavy flow now well up into his chest , and crossed over and , aimlessly , began following the low , thick wall . Sunlight struck the back of his leather jacket ; the cloud of dust had settled long ago . With a roar , a big Mack truck went tearing up the street . In the windows of the Manufacturer 's Trust Company Bank was a new poster , a polite sign which arrestedthe roving eye : " Are you going abroad ? Please step inside and inquire about our check service . " When he had walked around the square twice , following the wall , Hank saw the bootblacks arriving ; they came hurrying into position and by some mutual unspoken law took their posts about ten feet apart ; and there was no crowding , either . Some of the " boys " were old and gray , and had shapeless faces , as if hammer blows had been struck them , right between the eyes , on the nose , all over . That 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk while they gave you shines , s'r , shines , s'r , only 5c . Time and tide . By ten o'clock Hank was sick and tired of walking around the square . There were crowds crossingall the while , and new faces , but he got tired looking at them and also tired of counting sidewalk cracks . In the center of the square a gang of men were standing around a big , empty ash-can because a fire was going there , and the men were chilly and shabby , and Hank saw an old geezer taking off his hat , hold it over the blaze , then clamp it onto his dome quickly . The man was old , was bald , and did this many times , then rubbed his hands with a sort of glee . Hank struck west . He walked westward on Fourteenth Street , but when he saw the swank of Fifth Avenue , the long cool flanks of gray buildings on each side of the street , he turned back and headed east . He came up to Third Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentry ambling by with creased faces , and felt more at home . Walking south , he soon passed Eleventh Street and went briskly , in case his missus was out shopping ; he passed pawn-shops , barber colleges , hash-houses , Gus Abrams ' Store For Fat Men ( get your oversize underwear here ! ) , the famous Crystal Lunchroom , " cider " stores , Italian groceries , and a dim doorway where a gypsy woman of generous build , who was giving her small child the breast , went " tsk , tsk , tsk " to the men passing by , yearning to read their palms ; and pretty soon Hank reached the Bowery . Here he took his time , he was a man among men here ; the heavy flow was still in his chest now , but because it had been there for some time it did not feel so cold . The bums and unemployed stood on the west side of the street , standing in the sun . The east side was cool and shady , no one walked there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . By noon he had an unemployed feeling in his bones . He passed a few soup-lines and saw men shoving and arguing to keep their places . The line went raggedly around two corners , like a long , disjointed tapeworm . All was meek/ness , all was humbleness . The sign , JESUS SAVES , was not lit up , it was daylight now . Those who came out of the soup-kitchen walked smartly for a half a dozen paces or so , then slouched along , their eyes sniffing at the curbing hungrily for cigarette butts . In so short a time Hank became educated in the humanities , in all the social sciences ; he knew what he was up against . A walk through the illustrated corridors of BoweryUniversity was a mighty instructive course . Exhibit A and B and also C were on view , guys in varied stages of decay , illuminating matter on the situation of our times . Noon arrived over the iron-hooved town , the sun hung brightly brilliant over the rooftops ; a wintry day . Hank 's legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thinking . He turned west again , taking slow , sluggishbreaths , and made for home . There was no other place to go ; he could n't run away from it , sooner or later there must be a showdown . Bending his head , staring at sidewalk cracks again , he walked west . It was ten after twelve when he entered the doorway of Twenty-Door City , ten minutes after twelve by all the correct clocks in town . In the flat his kids were already eating , their heads bent over , their mouths close to the spoons , while Hank 's missus was dishing out the food . The oldest tried to get a bigger helping and got slapped over the wrist sharply ; and after that the lad was quiet . In the other room the youngest , the infant ( nine months old now ) , was gurgling in his little bed , an old silver spoon clutched in his hands , gurgling to the walls . In the kitchen steam rose from the pot . Outside , in the hallway , Hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and fell unevenly , as if he had just unloaded an extra heavy hand-truck piled with pig-iron . He stood there , no thoughts at all in his head . At last , placing a heavy fist on the doorknob , he went inside . His wife gave a little cry , a startled half-scream , as if she had just seen a ghost or something . The kids , their spoons midway to their mouths , turned gapingly , but did n't take it in such a spectacular manner , Hank 's dramaticentrance . There he stood , at the threshold , in the center of the Austin stage . He came inside with averted eyes . There was a good , rosy color in his cheeks from walkingall morning in the cold air , he looked healthy all right , but oh Christ , how heavy his legs felt , especially up in the thighs . He was fagged out , his eyes were dead . Missus Austin , squat , faithful , sturdy , loyal Missus Austin , could n't get it through her head that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a statue , a dipper in her hand , her eyes fixed , all her robust body hard and firm as wood , her brain stopped short like a stationary train on a railroad track . " Hank , " she said at last , clear and cold like pure icewater . And Hank stood dumb , stood dumbly in all his powerful Yankee frame . He took his cap off , and his dry hair rose slowly upward like needles on a porcupine 's back . " Hank , " his missus said again , her brain coming alive , the hard wood feeling melting from her flesh , leaving it weak as water . The kids , thinking their old man had a bit of a vacation , turned to their bowls and went on eating , shoveling the food in . Hank went slowly to the sink and washed his hands . The hot water felt strange and scalding against the chilled flesh . He wiped each mitt carefully , there was no sensep233getting his skin chapped this time of the year . His wife , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dropped the dipper loaded with hot soup over the eldest 's head . Hank pulled up a chair and sat down . He set his elbows on the edge of the kitchen table and stared vacantly ahead . One of the kids kicked his shin playfully under the table , grinned , and waved his spoon , but Hank did n't notice , did n't even feel the blow at all . The kid , disappointed , sniffled , then dug into the bowl again with the shovel of his big tablespoon . The missus put down another plate . After a few hot gulps of pea soup Hank said , his voice dead , that he had no job . The kids stared pop-eyed . No job ? That meant that papa would have something else to do then , that 's what it meant . Little by little , as the soup went down hotly , as the boiled beef was crushed to a dampish , softish mush between his jaws , it all came out . " I was laid off Saturday , " Hank told his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Missus Austin sat there with hard , frightened , startled body , every muscle set . " For good ? Is the lay-off for good ? " " Do n't know , " said Hank , the meat-mush warm and tasteless in his mouth . The kids got excited and pounded him with questions but received no answers . The sight of him in the flat when there was school , when they were due back to the classes soon , sent them up in the air . Pa 's home , he 's sitting right with us now , right in the middle of the day . One of them , going back into the smaller room to get a good start , rushed growling forward at his father 's knees , snapping like a bulldog ; the impact almost threw Hank off his chair . He sat dead , not speaking . Then the kids grew silent , and hung around like old-faced , little men , like mournful Jews praying in a synagogue , their little faces sagging . " Pa ai n't got a job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door , as they went toward school again . " He ai n't working any more , he ai n't got a job . " Missus Austin , her eyes wet and glassy , buttoned their coats with fumbling fingers . As soon as they were gone , she closed the door and started crying quietly . In the other room the infantgurgled to the walls . Hank sat on in silence , staring at the floor . After a while his missus ' tears started gushing more freely and she had to blow her nose often . She started asking questions but the way she bawled he could n't understand half of them . His answers were dead and hollow . He got up and washed his hands at the sink again and dried them carefully , no sense getting them chapped in this kind of weather . And hours later , when the kids came home , they found him there , and they jumped upon him , and pulled his long arms , pinched his back , and forced him to crawl on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see his eyes . In the other room near the sleeping infant Hank 's missus was weeping quietly . She was standing in a dark corner , away from the kitchen light , her hands half hiding her face ; and both her palms were wet and sticky from her tears . Darkness came on , a cold blue frost . Over the ironhoovedtown the last part of the day went marching , tramping up the cold , gray streets . Please step inside and inquire about our check service . In a flat next door a young couple were getting ready to take in a Broadway show.  |p235THEY  WERE PUTTING ON their hats and coats , the " Russians " were . Vanya shoved his arms through the sleeves of his overcoat and grunted like a great fellow , like a lusty Russian councilor , frowning as he did so . Natasha , thinking a while , musing over the matter , finally put on her smart Russian boots , stamped a bit , tugged at the leather tops , then smiled at her slim , booted legs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out into the East Side night , into the cold blue frost . As far as the corner they walked chattering to each other , blowing vapor from their mouths , walking away from the Glen Cove Apartments ; and when they turned north on Fourth Avenue a draft of cold air struck them squarely and into Vanya 's chest there crept the old , old plaint . " Natasha , " he said , bending his body forward , bracing his short , fat legs against the gust , " Natasha . " But Natasha had all she could do to keep herself upright against the howling breeze ; her coat and skirt flapped against her leather boots , her nose grew rosy as a little cherry plucked too soon . " Natasha , " Vanya said again ; and cold air drove into his opened mouth . Natasha did n't hear . Bending his head still lower , Vanya walked on , thinking and thinking  --  thinking how , when he had come home from work this evening he had seen Natasha coming out of the I.R.T. subway entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had been using his elbow for a rudder , steering an uncharted course through the surging home-going crowd . The man was tall , tall and slim , and all at once Vanya knew he must be that assistant manager who worked in the basement of the Bronx department store with Natasha.  | Averting his face , crossing Fourteenth Street in the teeth of a withering cross-fire of traffic , going against the lights and the yells of Officer Frank Hajek , Vanya had hurried home , arriving breathless ; and five minutes later , when Natasha came in , her face rosy from the cold , he got busy trying to open up a can of sardines and smiled with tremblinglips as Natasha spoke cheerfully of the day at the store . They had half-rate tickets for the show , Natasha had gotten them from the store . On and on , through wind and breeze , they struggled to the square , to the subway entrance . " Natasha , " said Vanya as the traffic lights changed , as they passed Officer Hajek who was still at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Natasha , we 'll have to hurry , the show will start soon . " And down into the subway entrance they went . Vanya stuck two nickels in the slot . " Have you got the tickets ? " said Natasha when they were on the platform , waiting for a train . Vanya , touching a pocket at his breast , nodded . " And the little package ? " Again Vanya nodded , a small smile creeping into the corners of his loyal " Russian " mouth . He touched another pocket , at the hip . ( A packet of sunflower seeds was there . ) Fifteen minutes later they were in the show , inside where it was warm and cozy , where other people sat in rows and tiers , leaning forward all , eyes glued on the stage , ears cocked , must n't miss a single word . The curtain rose ; a tragedy in three acts , life in a small town , the wife of the small-town doctor , her yearning for the higher things of life , for beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearning touchingly presented : gazing at a picture-book ) . The small-town doctor was a faithful lad , but too much wrapped up in his work and the community , open at all hours , I am here to serve the people , a benefactorof humanity , and all that stuff . See him walk across the stage , a neat black satchel in his hand , wearing a quiet gray suit , trim spectacles ( by Hunkel 's , Broadway 's favoriteoculist , see program ) , his gaze serious , a thoughtful drawing-together of his carefully trimmed Broadway eyebrows . He 's a busy , indispensable professional man , and no lie , and the town needs him , right now he 's working on the case of Mrs. Beekman 's recently grown-up daughter , the one who had such sharp pains in her breasts not so long ago . In Act II , no smoking on the stairs , please , a stranger came to town , a strong , quiet engineer recently back from the pampas of the Argentine . " I have been busy building dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and manly on his rump . " I have had fever , have withstood the onslaughts of savages and native women , endured the poisonoussnakes and summer rains , have grown a half-beard down there in the tropic jungle . All night long the jaguars howled , it was terrific , a life where man is pitted against the elements . Ah , my friends , I am lucky to be alive . Well , here I am , look me over , " and he lights a cigarette expertly , fingers trained in the pampa way , a steady hand for a steady lad . In the audience the women heave sighs , the actor has some profile , what a nose , what a nose , my dear ! And please note ( not nose ) the cut of that coat , tailored in Bond Street , straight from London . The wife of the small-town doctor , making her entrance from center left , noting the stranger , walked across the stage from left to right , to center front , in her gracious , small-town way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising from his chair , his manly spine as straight and powerful as a granite column , the stranger rose to kiss her hand . " Ah , madam , " whispers he , bending low over the soft , pale hand . And into each other 's eyes they looked a long , long time . The yearning for a child , a piercing pain , turned slowly within her breast like little hatchets . The town folk talk , tea is served , more adventures about the pampas , the ladies wanting to know about the horrors of the jungles , the few men present dying to find out about the onslaughts of the native women . Time passes , aye , time and tide etc . . . . The lamps are low , all alone now , the small-town doe 's wife , the pampas engineer . The doe 's wife stands center front , her bosom heaving just a little ; and the engineer comes toward her from behind , strong and silent he comes , like a jaguar stalking a deer , only the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turns around , toward him . " Oh , Kenneth , at last you have come , " she softly breathes and is ready to swoon when he rushes forward , holds her tenderly , closely , the emoting muscles on his face emoting on all twelve cylinders ; and slowly the lights of the stage dim ( in the wings the head electrician is squirting tobacco juice at the floor , his hand on the switchlever ) , the lights dim more , dim down so low you can hardly see Kenneth carrying the doe 's wife tenderly to the couch at right center . And as they embrace there , comfy now , the curtain falls , and up in the gallery an old maid of forty winters screams spitefully , silently to herself : " I bet she 's going to have a baby in Act III . " More time and tide . . . . Act III , the doctor patiently pacing , Vanya and Natasha leaning forward with the others , cracking their sunflower seeds , chewing , spitting the emptied shells to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand tightly , tightly . A phone rings , yes , Missusp239Beekman , open at all hours , your daughter again ? She has pains in her legs now ? I 'll be right over , duty , I am here to serve you , the public , a benefactor to humanity , please pay your bills promptly , after all , I have to live , too . Walking thoughtfully across the stage from left to right he exits , drawing his thoughtful brows together , his satchel in his hands . The door closes with a little noise behind him , anotheropens silently . " Oh , Kenneth , he 's gone , he 's gone , dear . " " Darling . " Clinching , kissing , shoving their faces at each other in a goody-goody fashion , no rough , realistic pawing , you know , does n't pay to make the scene too lifelike . In the gallery the old maid feels sure the kid is due soon ( the program says five months later , autumn , dead leaves outside the window ) . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go , darling , the pampas are calling , there 's a bridge waiting for me , a pretty high one at that . " " But . . . but . . . " and the dot 's wife says no more . ' T is the child , the child for sure , screams the old maid in the gallery silently , voicelessly to herself . And as they clinch for the last time the door at left opens slowly , cautiously , and the doctor ( who 's not the fool he looks to be , cheers for him ! ) sees and knows all . They draw back startled . The engineer , thinking fast , engineers a strong , manly look upon his powdered face , he shoves his jaw out , draws the wife snugly into the crook of his arm . " Do what you will , " he seems to say , engineering himself into the spotlight , his profile to the dames all over the house . " Do what you will , we love each other . " Anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author saw to that , the play is half-sold to the movie people and it looks like a real money-maker all around . But time and tide , the play must go on . " My place is with my husband , " the small-town wife of the small-town doctor says , going to her legal man.  | " My place is with Tom . " And the engineer understands , besides , he 's getting a little tired of the third act by this time and has a dinner date at twelve sharp at the Lido . " Then I must return to the Argentine alone ? " But he knows the answer , the crafty hound . " And . . . and the . . . ? " A long , long pause , the old maid in the gallery knows what he means , he ca n't fool her , he ca n't . " I have told Tom all , " the wife answers , simply , humbly . " We shall name him Kenneth . " Slow exit for the engineer , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of his head . Back to the pampa bridges for him , back to the savages , back to the onslaughts of the native women . The men in the audience stir slightly . " Oh , Tom , " says the wife when alone with the doc , " oh , Tom . . . " A long , long husband-and-wife kiss , a happy sigh from her . And as they walk slowly across the stage the phone rings , the doc goes over . " Yes ? Missus Beekman ? Your daughter has pains in her ears ? I 'll be right over , " and he makes ready to go . Duty , that 's the ticket , duty . He must go . He went . Taking up his satchel , he crossed the stage , from left to right , then returned to deposit a kiss upon his wife 's brow , then out into the night for him , into the small-town surge and flow . Duty . Standing alone , clasping her hands to her breast , a happy smile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery , to see what kind of a house she had been playing to , the smalltownwife brought the drama to a close . Off-stage the whistle of a steamboat , a liner bound for the Argentine , flutter of handkerchiefs , all this by clever suggestion . The curtain fell , the small-town wife stood at center , her hands still clasped , smiling at the gallery . Gowns by Mme. Dupons , do n't run in case of fire , keep cool , choose your exit . Lights ; and the bang of seats.  |p241It  was all over now . Vanya helped Natasha with her coat , squinting in the light . Both thought the show was a corker ; they smiled at each other . There was so much tragedy in life , but a wife had to remain faithful and do her duty , Vanya said . Natasha , thinking of the engineer 's profile , that nose , nodded vaguely . As they rose from the seats , the shells of many sunflower seeds fell to the floor from their laps , as in the cinemas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natasha shook her coat out briskly . It was cold walking to the subway . They got in a train and sat close together , in the hurrying car , thinking of the play , Vanya still talking about the duties of a wife . Then his mind turned a sharp corner . " But , of course , it 's not as good as the Russian drama , " he said . " Not as good as Chekhov . " " Ah , The Cherry Orchard , Vanya , who can write with so much sadness ? " " Ah , The Cherry Orchard , Natasha , that last scene where the woodcutters are chopping down the cherry trees and the old faithful servant is left behind . Who can write plays like Chekhov ? " And " Ah , " they said together . At Union Square they got out , climbed up to the street and once more were walking in the cold , the cold blue frost ; and as another gust hit them squarely , Natasha , thinking of all the sad , dead things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Vanya , how much pain there is in life , how much pain ! " Just then a shabby little fellow came up and asked for a dime in a piteous whine . He said he was hungry , he had no place to go . The young " Russian " couple started walkingfaster , their hearts fluttering as the little shabby fellowfollowed a few paces , then by brisk walking , by looking sternly straight ahead , they finally left the fellow behind . The remainder of the distance to the apartment they walked without speaking . And just before retiring , Natasha , thinking again of all the sad , dead things in life , thinking of the melancholy plays of Chekhov , said , " Oh , Vanya , how much pain there is in life , how much pain ! " Vanya , looking sadly toward the floor , his back to the copper belly of the samovar , nodded slowly . In his breast there rose the old , old plaint . Grunting , rolling over , he clicked out the little table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , across the hall , a door bang sharply . Margie had come back again . THE ECHO of the banging door faded in the hallway . After one day and night , Margie had returned . Mr. Boardman , sitting in the deep chair drawn up to the table , writing a letter-to his sixteen-year-old daughter at last , raised his head quietly . At the door , tall , silent , waiting , her face slightly tortured , slightly pleading , stood Margie . With a hasty movement , Mr. Boardman swept the half-finished letter quickly into the pocket of his smoking jacket , and laid his fountain pen aside . His lips moved , but no words came . Margie stood there . " Well , I 'm back , " she said softly , staring at his eyes . She came over quietly and took her things off . " Do you want me back , can you stand the sight of me ? " She still spoke softly , still stood staring at his eyes ; and in the long , long silence she read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mouth tightened a bit , then quivered . She came over quickly then , a little , moaning cry breaking from her , every bit of goodness she possessed melting from her eyes . She was crying a little ; and sat on the wide arm of the deep chair , and buried her face in his shoulder , and started rubbing slowly the breast of his jacket , sobbing just a little . " I was at Daisy 's , I stayed there all last night . " She blew her nose . " I do n't know what 's the matter with me , dear , I guess I 'm goofy . Kiss me . Oh , for Christ 's sake , kiss me ! " He kissed her . " Kiss me again , I ca n't stand this ! " She pulled his head down and gave him her hot , quivering mouth ; and all the while she clutched the breast of his smoking jacket , and cried a little , and said , over and over , " I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her whole body was trembling . Then she lay quiet against him , still in the chair , and stroked slowly the smooth , silk lapels of his smoking jacket , and grew calmer . She sat with his head pressed against the left side of her breast and he could hear the heartbeats growing slower . In the kitchen the alarm clock ticked , tick and tock , just like her heartbeat . " Oh , my God , Boardie , " she said and began crying all over again , with more violence , cuddling his head in her arms , covering his face with tiny , impulsive kisses . Later on , when she was calm again , Mr. Boardman started to say something , but she put her finger to his lips , then kissed him quietly . They sat on in silence . Her weight was pleasant at first , then heavy in his lap . They sat on . Toward one o'clock in the morning they were still sitting like that . His right leg had long since fallen asleep , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread softly through the front-room windows , until dawn broke over the frosty town . Neither spoke , her cheek still lay quietly against his face . So calm , so still . And when at last they rose , stiffened , they stood and smiled at each other , wan smiles , and gave each other long , quiet , thirsty , happy looks . Then Margie found her voice . She went into the kitchen singing , her dress crumpled from so much sitting , and made a pot of hot coffee and over the steaming cups they looked at each other and , turning , saw the dawn grow clearer . Outside , on the fire escape , a cat was sleeping ; the wind moved its fur a bit . Over the rooftops of the city the morning climbed , the hum of Fourth Avenue traffic floated toward the building . When it was time for him to go , time for him to start for the office , Margie helped him with his coat and ran to fetch his hat ; and at the door she clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both of them were very moved and happy . She did n't close the door until she heard the entrance door below bang shut . Then she went to stand at the front windows . Pretty soon she saw him cross over to the other side of the street and start walking westward . He walked briskly , with a hint of jauntiness to his stride . She watched him as he walked firmly up the street and saw him strike at the sidewalk occasionally with the tip of his cane , lightly . Then he turned smartly , out of sight . The street was empty . She must have stood at the windowfor a long while after that , because pretty soon she saw the first few kids going into the Catholic school across the street and then , leaning her brow against the cool pane of the window , she began sobbing quietly and had to go into the next room for her handkerchief.  |p245A  FEW MINUTES later the lower door of the Glen Cove Apartment opened and Mr. Franconi came forth . The kids were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ran and shouted on ahead of him . Drawing on his gloves , Mr. Franconi stared at the hooded sisters in the doorway , walked briskly past the gathered unemployedin front of the cooks-and-waiters ' agencies and headed for the Fourteenth Street subway station . When he reached the barber-shop , the porters were mopping up the floor . He stepped carefully across the puddled water , where the suds had gathered in the slight hollows around the chairs ( caused by walking round and round a chair a hundred million times or so ) , took his hat and coat off , slipped into a clean white jacket , and went to stand before the mirror , combing back his hair . Only a few barbers were about , it was very early yet ; and these few were in the rear , near the " sanctum , " and were scanningthe latest racing-form , doping out a sure winner . The front door opened and the first of the manicure girls arrived ( the shop had three ) , a peppy little kid with a good shape ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled her stockings up tight while the Negro porters , bent down , swishing the heavy mops over the tiles , grinned slyly at the floor . " Hi , Andre , " she said briskly , pleasantly . " Hi . " Mr. Franconi , busy combing his hair , smiled into the mirror , and so she received it in reflection . She walked briskly back toward the rear of the store , her high heels rapping smartly against the tiles , her small , rounded buttocksquivering , humming a tune all the way back there . When she returned , she was wearing a short frock of clingingmaterial , jersey silk , no sleeves , a low-cut V neck , a garment for the trade . All the girls in the shop wore that type of dress . She slowed down and came up to Mr. Franconi , who was still combing , stood beside him , and he , looking at her in the mirror , noted a rashy area of skin on her neck and under her left ear . The girl saw that he noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he rubbed his chin last night , Andre . " Mr. Franconi , running the comb again through his smooth black hair , smiled in the glass . " You should have given him a shave first , Andre . Christ , what a brute he was , he could n't wait . " " He was a wild man , eh ? " " And how ! And how , Andre ! " She went over to her table , opened the drawer , and took out snippers , files , orange-sticks and nail-polish , getting things ready . Up ahead , in the front of the store , the porters were finishing up the mopping , dry-mopping now , taking their time , speaking in low Negro voices to each other . Outside , going past the window briskly , men and women hurried to work . " Well , Andre , " said the girl softly , coming over , nuzzlingher cheek against the back of his shoulder as he stood there combing , " well , Andre , when are you giving me a break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling suavely , saw her looking up at him with large , pleading , bedroom eyes . " Eh , Doris , " he said , " you 're too hot for me , " and laughed a little as he said it . Doris was a new girl , this was her second week at the shop . Up in front the Negroes , swishing with long , lazy strokes , grinned slyly at the floor again . " Ole Andre , he 's got a way wid ' um , " they said . " He'sP247smart , he gets ' urn coming and going , they sure falls hard . " Two more barbers came in and took their coats off and blew on their hands , then went back to the " sanctum " in the rear to study the racing sheet , to see how the ponies were running . In fifteen minutes the boss arrived , Mr. Hugo Flenckner himself , six feet two , forty-eight inches around the waist , an eighteen-inch collar . All the barbers , sixteen of them , fussed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got their razors and scissors ready , and laid up a fresh supply of towels . One man turned the hot water on and felt it with his finger , another stood frowning at his sharpening-stone . Mr. Hugo Flenckner , casting keen , piggy eyes up and down the line of empty chairs , cleared his throat , a business-like gleam stealing into his foxy stare . His blond hair , cropped close , rose shortly up like a bristly scrub-brush ; his face was pink and healthy-looking . One of the porters hurriedly swabbed the first chair with a damp rag , from top to bottom , all around . The two other manicurists came in later , hardly looking at the boss ; they were the old hands , had their following , and Hugo treated them with kid gloves . Many of his customers came into the shop solely to talk to the girls ; neither was young any more , but they were pleasant , hefty women , nice to gab to about home and business while one of the boys ran a razor down your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairs were filled . You could hear the firm smack of cloth as the porters bent low over the customers ' shoes , giving the gents a good shine . Steam rose from the sinks , hot towels lay wet and heavy over the Wall Street faces . Mr. Franconi , working suavely , expertly , moving his hands like an artist , was taking care of Mr. B. Sackheim , a big-time advertising man with offices in the Herald-Tribune Building . Doris was giving Sackheim a manicure , looking up at Mr. Franconiin the pauses . " A lousy week , " Sackheim was saying , a generous , good-natured man , a swell tipper , too . " Andre , I happen to belong to that great class of suckers known as the Americanadvertising man . Once upon a time , Andre , I wanted to own a small country newspaper . " A wet , steaming towel , descending upon his face , interrupted the homily for a second . Doris changed her stool and started on his left hand . " Yes , Andre , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , but here in New York I 'm just a little belch in a big gale . " Mr. Franconi was a good listener . He smiled and said a few words . Sackheim grunted , he liked his steady barber . " I bet you , too , wanted to be something else , hey , Andre ? " " Me , I can not kick . I am a modest man . " " Aw nerts , Andre . The hell you are . Look here , what town in Italy did you come from ? " " From Bessano . " " Bessano ? Never heard of it . Anyway , Andre , you should have stayed there . What have you got here ? Well , what have you got ? Just a razor in your hand and a couple of hot towels on my mug . Believe me , Andre , you and I should be back in Bessano drinking up the wine . " Mr. Franconi , placing his palms soothingly against Mr. Sackheim 's jowls , began shaving . " Business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's lousy , Andre . Bessano is the place , my businessshould be in Bessano . Ask the girl if she was ever in Bessano , Andre . " P249The barber turned . " Doris , have you ever been in Bes-sano ? " " The only foreign country I 've ever been to is Buffalo . " " Ha , ha , " said Sackheim , and then they had a good , three-cornered conversation going , all talking , all taking turns . Mr. Hugo Flenckner , looking keenly down the line , saw that his best man , Andre , was giving the gent " the works , " a haircut , shave , message , shampoo , and a dose of the best tonic . He eased up the aisle , old Hugo did , his belly bulging from out his starched , white jacket . " Everything all right , Mr. Sackheim ? " he inquired in passing . " Hunh ? Oh , sure , Andre is the best guy in the dump . " Hugo smiled , went back toward the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease , strained a little , and in due time walked up the aisle again , rubbing his plump hands slowly together , as if he had a lump of sweet-smelling fat between his palms . Andre gave Mr. Sackheim the final touches , and combed back the advertising man 's hair . Sackheim stepped heavily from the chair , a porter ran for his coat , started whacking the air with a big whisk-broom , and , after leaving tips all around , Mr. Sackheim walked out , a wide trail of tonic hanging in his wake . The little , peppy manicurist came over . " Andre , that friend of yours , that big palooka , he pinched me twice on the leg when you were at the sink with your back turned . " " Mr. Sackheim is a very fine man . He is a married man , Doris . " " Well , he gave my leg a feel just the same . . . . " And later : " Andre , I 'm not doing a thing tonight . How about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in a frown , the manicurist brought her bowl and instrumentsover to another customer and started working . The two other women , busy over hands , were watching narrowly . The day passed , the shop closed ; the lights went out , a wintry gloom outside . At the corner , walking toward the subway , Andre turned and found the little manicurist trailing him . He stopped , and for a second stood there irritated . She was a young kid , not more than nineteen or so . " Well , Andre ? " she said , and hooked her arm into his saucily . " Like me , like me just a little ? " He smiled , hiding his irritation , thinking hard , feeling a trapped sensation in his bones . He began arguing goodnaturedlywith her at first , then seriously . People were passing them on all sides , going down into the subway . " But I have an appointment , " he told her again and again . " Do you want me to be late ? " She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she shook her head and said he was lying . In the end he took her to a restaurant nearby . They sat eating , Doris looking lively-eyed at him , nibbling at the food , star-gazing , reaching over occasionally and holding his hand , when people were n't looking . Andre smiled , but his face was becoming drawn . He ate , but had no hunger ; and kept thinking how he could extricate himself without a forfeiture of honor . He sat there quietly , his brain racing ; and cursed himself and all the glamour that friends had cast over him down at the barber-shop and at the Italia Club . He sat at the table and called himself a fool . The waiter came over . Andre ran his glance down the lists of desserts on the menu . Chocolate custard , lemon creamP251pie , or our famous Southern spice-cake , all goods made on the premises . He ordered the custard . The waiter walked off . Then , addressing Doris , smiling and begging her pardon , he rose , excused himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door was behind the cloak rack . He called the head waiter over , whispered hurriedly , appeased the man by paying the check with an extra good tip topping it , then slipped his arms into his overcoat . The head waiter , alert , called a busboy over , spoke in a low tone , and the kid led Mr. Franconi through the kitchen , around two wooden barrels of slops , past the dish-washing department , and out upon the street by the employee 's entrance . Mr. Franconigave the boy a coin , then turned up the collar of his coat . It was raining outside , thinly . At the corner Mr. Franconipicked up a cab and rode on home . The next morning the two older manicure girls arrived first on the scene , for a change . They had been with the barber-shop for years , had made a play for Andre , and had long since given up hope of snagging him . They hung around the front of the store until the boss came in , then poured a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . Hugo Flenckner looked up and down the long store . Doris had not yet arrived . He nodded curtly at the two pleasant , hefty women ; and five minutes later , when Doris came in , Old Hugo 's big bulk blocked her entrance . In a few seconds , in a few words , he told her he did n't stand for affairs among his help . " That 's all , " he said . " Come around Saturday and we 'll settle up . " The two other manicurists happened to have their backs turned all the while , as soon as the door had opened . Andre was a trifle disturbed over the matter when the boss eased up later and told him softly all about it , but in the end he felt thankful and very much relieved . His reputationamong his fellow barbers rose higher than ever and for the next few days the two manicurists , Alice and Margaret , looked pleasantly his way , working up the old hopeless , yearning feeling , then the shop settled down , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON WEDNESDAY Jason decided to make a little trip to Philadelphia . He had received a small check for another story , paid Pete five dollars on the bill , another five against rent due , and had a little over . The bus fare for a round trip was about three-fifty . He went out and got a haircut , bought a toothbrush and scrubbed his greenish teeth , then , because he had received another card from Miss Allen , met the young nurse in the doorway of the hospital in the afternoon . Behind his hornrimmedglasses his gray eyes stared forth thoughtfully . He took her to a movie at the Sheridan , stopped in a lunchroomfor a sandwich and coffee , and when they came out upon the street darkness was falling . Traffic tore up Seventh Avenue . Big buses bound for Newark and Jersey City rolled swiftly by , humming heavily . " Well , " he said , " I 'm leaving town for a few days , I 'm going to Philly . " Miss Allen asked no questions . She had noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eaten in the lunchroomhad seen that he had tried to clean his fingernails . " There 's a lot of people and a lot of houses down there , " said Jason . " I 'm going to take a look around , just a change of scenery . " UNION SQUARE 253 " Oh . " " Maybe I 'll drop you a card when I get there . " " I wish you would , " she said , and then there was nothing more to say . They walked toward the hospital , she was due for duty soon . " Will you stay there long ? " " Ca n't tell . Maybe a day , maybe a week , maybe an hour . " " Well , take care of yourself then , get plenty of sleep , " she said , then good-bye and went inside . The next day it rained . The wind , blowing in from the Battery , sent sheets of thin water hissing against the sides of buildings . In his room Jason stood near the windows , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was still raining . The rain fell hard and steady now , blurring the panes of glass . Jason stood looking at the wet walls of the tenements across the way for a long time . Then , suddenly putting on his hat and coat , he slammed the door and took the subway to the bus terminal , where he bought a ticket and hung around until the Philadelphiabus pulled up alongside the curb . The road leading out across New Jersey cut across rolling country . Hills rose and fell and the land slipped away before the silent wheels of the hurrying bus . In the distance a mist was always hanging over the fields , because the rain was falling steadily , and as the bus sped on the mist receded , sometimes blue and sometimes gray in color , but the thin haze was always there . Jason , his stare fixed upon the cold , wet landscape , sat hunched in front , near the driver , shaking gently from side to side . Every so often he rubbed the misted pane with his palm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It rained back in New York , over the five boroughs of thep254city , upon the spanning bridges and the deserted docks . Ships came and dumped their loads and the loads were covered with tarpaulins ; the perishable goods were hustled away by fast-working longshoremen . The rain drove hard down the streets and sent the venders and peddlers from the square . People did not venture against the traffic lights now , but stood well back upon the sidewalks , because in the hollows of the street was water , and when traffic went by a swish of dirty liquid went spurting at your clothes . The traffic cops , in the middle of the street , stood salient in their rubber boots and coats , rubber coveringtheir caps , too , and water fell from their rubbered , shiny shoulders . They stamped and sloshed about and waved their arms and blew their whistles . Darkness came on early . The rain thinned out , a sifting drizzle ; from the inside of a house , looking out , you could not tell if the rain had stopped or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the drizzle stopped , the wind went up and down the town , swinging all the signboards , whipping the wet streets dry , sneaking around the corners . On Third Avenue Pete poked his head from his front door , stuck out his palm , and it came back dry ; no rain . Then he came back and stood thinking about the next day 's menu , wondering and thinking hard . He had his troubles , that pock-marked Serbian had . A LITTLE LATER , at seven o'clock , the streets of the town were bone-dry . At seven-fifteen , as the clocks were striking the quarterhour , Celia put her hat and coat on , held her purse tightly , P255told her aunt she was going to the library on Second Avenue , and left the house quickly . Three blocks away she slowed her pace . Above a drug store ( and she had passed and stared up many times ) there hung a sign , a big , gilt sign with two strong electric bulbs glaring toward the print : " Painless Dentist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also Gas Administered . " Celia stood hesitating before the doorway , then turned the heavy knob and found herself inside the hall . She started climbing . In her purse was seven dollars and sixty cents  --  a few singles , the rest small change . The dentist , hearing footsteps , darted into the next room and came out wearing a short white jacket and also a busy frown . He snatched up an artificial plate and as the door opened was scowling thoughtfully at the dental work in his hands . He was a very young man , recently graduated , but he knew a thing or two . Swinging around , as if just noticing the young girl for the first time , he set the plate down , still frowning . " Good evening , madam , " and he smiled quietly . Celia smiled back and stood there feeling her purse and , in a gush , told him she had broken off a front tooth over two years ago and she wanted a new one and she had seven dollars and sixty cents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his fingertips , looked serious , and gave his whole attention to the business at hand . " Sit in the chair , " he said . Celia took her hat and coat off and sat . " Now open your mouth . " Her mouth went open , wide open . He poked here and there with a cold metal instrument . " Ah , " he said at last , straightening up , glancing4 sharply round the room . He picked up another instrument and looked some more . " You have a very bad tooth there , miss , a ticklish job . " Celia , her mouth still open , swallowed . " You may close your mouth , " he said . Then she lay back , panting a little , staring at the ceiling , wondering if she had enough money , if she had come to the right place , wondering and thinking all about it . The doctor 's diploma hung in a frame a little to the left , and right in front of her ( she could n't miss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit required on all work begun . " The doctor , his back toward her , was standing at the cabinet , looking for something , humming . When he turned around he had several loose false teeth , samples , in his hand which he held close to Celia 's mouth , trying to get a good match . " How long will it take ? " said Celia , still lying there , still staring at the ceiling . The dentist , looking for another sample tooth , began his humming again . Celia plucked the edge of her dress down , why , she had been sitting with too much of her shapely little legs showing ! When the dentist came over again , with a new tooth , she asked once more , " How long will it take ? " He turned the tooth slowly between thumb and forefinger . " You have a bad tooth there , a ticklish job , miss . How long has it been broken off ? " And Celia answered , still wondering if she had enough money , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have shopped around first , prices were cheaper at other places maybe . " I 'll have to reinforce the new tooth with posts behind and then attach it to your other teeth , " said the dentist.  | " A ticklish job , but leave it to me , I 'll do it so neatly no one will know you 've got a false tooth there . " " How much will it cost ? " He placed the tooth down , picked it up , then placed it down again . " For twenty-five dollars I 'll do a first-class job . " Celia almost bounced out of the chair . Twenty-five dollars ? Why  --  she had seen advertisements in the paper where you could get two whole new plates , upper and lower , for seven-fifty each . The dentist explained , smiling a little , thinking fast . If he did the job a different way he could do it for ten dollars ; that meant filing down the tooth on each side and attaching the new one by a cap , not so neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make the job for twelve-fifty , if you want me to . However , I 'll have to use a rear band , not the posts to hold the tooth in place . " Twelve-fifty ? For one tooth ? " I 'll tell you what , for ten dollars I 'll handle the job . I 'll file down a tooth on either side tonight , the pulling wo n't take a second , the tooth is loose and is ready to fall out any day by itself . " All right . The price was agreed . The young man swung into action , and scratched his mustache ( grown to make him look older ) , and as he worked he talked a bit , finding out if the patient had a family , sniffing around for new customers . He hummed , talked pleasantly ; and a halfhourlater , feeling the raw gum near the new socket with the point of her tongue , Celia walked up the windy street toward home , feeling very daring and very happy . It had n't hurt much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of , either . She walked rapidly toward the rooming house , stood near the front door hunting for her key , then remembered she was supposed to have gone to the library on Second Avenue . Running down the stairs quickly , she hurried east , walked the few blocks , reached the library just before closing time and snatched the first book from the shelves her hands touched , from the shelf marked : TRAVEL ; and when she returned home , her aunt , looking up from her reading , glancing up from a last year 's number of the National Geographic Magazine ( she had a friend who had a brother-in-law who was a missionary over in India ) , wanted to know what book Celia had brought from the library , and reached a long bony arm across the table . Her brows shot up , she started smiling pleasantly , and turned the first few leaves . " From Delhi to Peshawar by Elephant , ah , I 've heard of this book . Can I read it , Celia , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into her room , and for the next half-hour stood before her mirror , practicing silently how to talk and smile without showing that new hole in the front of her mouth . JASON CAME BACK to New York the next day , in the afternoon , gray in the face , silent . He sat in his room thinking for a while , then went out and in a basement joint in the Village bought a quart of gin . In his room again he started drinking , but the uplift was slow in coming . He corked the bottle , laid it aside . He went out again . The second building south had a brown door . . . .  |p259When  Leon came up he knocked , and receiving no response , turned the knob and walked in . Jason lay flat on his back , dead drunk . The ex-poet 's relaxed face , the loosened , softened mouth , the glasses awry low on the nose , wrenched at the painter 's heart . Going over , he shook Jasongently , but Jason did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled . The drawn lids had a sickly bluish tint , the temples , too , were bluish gray . He snatched his handkerchief from his pocket , wet it at the small , dirty sink in the corner and applied it to Jason 's brow . Then he shook Jason . Jason lay like a sack of wheat . Leon , all excited now , hurried downstairs and phoned Miss Allen at the hospital . Ten minutes later , alarmed , out of breath , the young nurse climbed the five flights ( her first time here ) , and came into the ex-poet 's quarters . She was still on duty , but had begged a few minutes off from the head nurse by sayingshe had an uncle who was in trouble somewhere . She came in her uniform hidden under a long winter coat . In ten minutes she had Jason 's eyes open . She sent Leon out for a bottle of rubbing alcohol and cotton and started massaging Jason behind the ears , at the base of his neck , his temples . He came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood near , holding the opened bottle and the cotton . Leon started smiling when he saw a weak grin spreading Jason 's mouth slightly wider . The nurse , lookingup , smiled , too . " How did you know where to reach me ? " " He spoke about you once or twice . " The young girl was curious . " What did he say ? " But Leon did n't answer . The truth was , Jason had said he was being pestered by a young kid from some farm up- state , just a kid , and she 's a nurse over at St. Vincent 's . The nurse rubbed some more , not so vigorously now , and in a little while Jason was able to sit up and began complaining he had a splitting headache . He was still a little drunk . Seeing Miss Allen start cleaning up the place , sweeping the floor , picking up old bottles and papers , he half-rose on his elbow , swore under his breath , and told her to leave things alone , then lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while later . Later on , when she was through cleaning up , when he felt a bit better and lay quiet , breathing easier , she came over to the cot and looked at him , and spoke to him , and lifted up his hand to feel his wrist . Then she gave a sharp , startled cry . She rolled his sleeve up quickly . " Dope  --  you 've been taking dope ! " she cried and stared at the raw , red-looking little scars all over his forearm . Her professional composure left her , she was just a weepy kid from an upstate farm . He lay there like a stick listening to her , not moving , not answering , just lying there . After a while she got a grip on herself and washed his arms above the elbow with the rest of the alcohol . Then , rolling him over , she undressed him completely and , makingmany trips to the sink , gave him a very thorough sponge bath , using the alcohol sparingly so that it would last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterwards she helped him on with his clothes and he said he felt better . He looked around , but she had put the bottle of gin away , out of sight . He lay down peacefully and fell into a deep , sweet sleep . That night , when Leon came up again to see how his palwas getting on , he found Jason looking very well indeed . In fact Jason was feeling so well that , as soon as Leoncame in , the ex-poet started a hot argument , and , ofp261course , it had to center around communism again , as that was Leon 's tender spot . " Well , Leon , " Jason said , " how 's the tempo going along on Fourteenth Street ? Anything new along the heroic East Side frontier ? " Leon sat up stiffly , tried to change the subject , made up his mind he would not be ensnared again , but Jason continuedprodding . " The trouble with those speakers in Union Square is that they 're all a bunch of small peanuts and petty soreheads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screaming , pointing across the Atlantic to Russia , talking about Tom Mooney until you get an earache , and telling the crowd it 's a bunch of suckers . That 's no way to turn the trick , you ca n't afford to make the masses feel uncomfortableand stand there squirming . Why , I 've seen plenty of men come up and at first stand around interested , but the orator turns on his bitter , sarcastic spout , starts to calling everybody who is n't a communist a dirty name and pretty soon the newcomers start squirming ' , feel a bit revolted , and walk off . And who 's left behind listening ? Why , a few old panhandlers from the Bowery and a half a dozen venders with their carts drawn up close , hollering peanuts , shoestrings , hot chestnuts , or maybe a cheap brand of razor blades . Every time I pause in front of a speaker I recognize the same faces and hear the same speech . It gets to be like one of those piano exercises , two notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedal . " " The masses have to be made class-conscious , " said Leon quietly , snared at last , answering . " The way the Party is functioning here , it 'll take two hundred years to get the people class-conscious . Why , comrade , they talk about being militant , always about be- ing militant , but they have n't the sense to realize that beingmilitant is just a small part of the matter . What 's needed is careful planning , clear thinking , a definite five- , ten- , or fifteen-year plan of agitation . Being militant is n't enough . A small kid who does n't like castor oil can be militanttoward his parents and endure a spanking bravely . Brains , that 's what 's needed , but alas , little Leon , little comrade mine , brains are not forthcoming . " Leon shifted in his chair . " Let 's go out for a walk , " he said quietly , and Jason said he could stand some air . On the way downstairs the ex-poet again swung back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lack a sense of humor ; you eat , sleep , think , and breathe communism twenty-four hours a day , and no man can keep that up for any length of time without going batty in the belfry . Take it from me , a guy has to have a sense of humor . For instance , he has to fall in love with the wrong girl every so often . " Jason lit his cigarette and threw the burning match on the stairs . Leon , who was walking behind , stepped on it . " Sure , " said Jason , " here I went to Philadelphia yesterday  --  " " Did you see my painting ? " Leon broke in eagerly . " Your painting ? To hell with it ! As I was saying , here I went to Philadelphia for a change of scenery , for a chance to meet a certain party , and what did it get me ? I made a fool out of myself , with her silence she spat upon me . I stayed in the town for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good Christ , man , she barely looked at me , she was staring at the floor all the while . And I had a haircut and a shave . Sylvia , ' I says , I am a changed man . ' Aye , I spoke like the movie lads , low and quiet . Sylvia , ' I says , but she just sits there , and when her nosep263goes red and it looks like she 's about to start crying , why , I leave . " They were out on the street now and walked northward toward the square . Someone was speaking there , haranguing away , none other than Comrade Irving Rosenblum , who was giving the citizenry the lowdown on the whole rotten situation , telling them all about the inner workings of Tammany Hall and how different things were going on in Russia . He also threw a few words in about Tom Mooney  --  " Tom Mooney , fellow workers , who rots away in a California prison while the capitalists grow fat and greasy on his life-blood ! " Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , and no mistake ; his throat was quivering as if a fish were flopping inside near the throttle . " Take the Government , " he shouted , flinging out his fist , glaring at the heads below , " take the Government . They know bad times are here , but what are they doing about it ? Comrades , what are they doing about it ? Ah , do n't worry , things will straighten out  --  like hell they will ! Fellow workers . Fellow workers , here in America , in the richest country in the world , with warehouses overflowing with food and clothing , ten million unemployed stalk the land and millions more are going hungry . . . . " And Rosie told them all about it . " Now , in Russia , " and his voice rose , " in Russia , fellow workers , there is no . . . " and he had to scream because a Fourteenth Street trolley was going by . " Peanuts , five cents a big bag , " sang out a vender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a few other peddlers began combing the small crowd . One or two citizens bought , the rest stood in the cold with their handsP264in their pockets . " Peanuts , five cents a bag , " sang out the vender softly , and wiped his watery nose on the hard , glossy sleeve of his shabby overcoat . " Fellow workers , " Rosie was shouting , winding up at the finish , calling all to the red banner . But at that moment a man in the crowd , a hawk-eyed fellow who saw Rosie glancing at his watch , at his gold watch , raised his voice and shouted to the crowd : " He talks about workingmen , about the masses , but he 's got a gold watch ! " he screamed . " He 's got gold in his palm and he talks about starving workers ! " The crowd whirled around , stiffened , thought in a flash , and swung over to the stranger 's side . Rosie stood there gasping , high and dry , his face flaming , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the outskirts , from the edge of the crowd . " You fools ! Does communism stand or fall just because a man owns a gold watch ? If a poor worker has one little gold filling in his mouth , would you line him up against a wall and shoot him ? And what the hell has a fellow 's gold watch got to do with communism , anyway ? " The crowd whirled again , stiffened , thought in a flash , and swung back to Rosie . The hawk-eyed gent edged off , slinking as he went . The crowd looked toward the last speaker , a pale young fellow wearing horn-rimmed glasses . " As our fellow worker in the audience pointed out , " yelled Rosie , recovering quickly , going better than ever now , " as our comrade in the crowd pointed out . . . " and he told the citizenry all about it . Jason and Leon , walking away , could hear the orator 's shouting long after they had drawn away . Leon lookedP265straight ahead , but his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly Jason , feeling old and hollow , thinking of Philadelphia , of his hack-writing , whirled around and holleredinto Leon 's face . " What are you grinning for ? " he shouted . " I put my nose in just for the sake of logic , just to show the crowd up for a pack of fools . Do n't think I give a damn about anything else , " and , staring straight ahead , his eyes hard and dry , he said no more . NIGHT ON THE SQUARE . . . a wintry night . Jasonand Leon walked around the square in silence a few more times , then went their ways . From the south , the Man Who Walks Backwards came , heard the orator 's words , stood about a while , then made off , tapping with his stout , blackened stick , his active eyes reflected in the mirrors attached to his glasses . He walked backwards , following the low , thick wall . Officer Terence McGuffy spotted him , let him go , just another freak , another nut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worn off . A few blocks south , in the Hungarian restaurant , anotherofficer , Mike Kelly , who had been hauled on the carpetnot so long ago , spoke threateningly to the frightened owner , and the Hungarian went back behind the counter and counted out some bills , cleaning himself out . " Is this enough , is this enough so that I wo n't get into trouble ? " In the kitchen , standing meek and stolid near the stove , his wife heard every word , and her legs started trembling . Officer Kelly , with his light blue eyes , looked darkly at
