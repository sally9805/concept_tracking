SWAMP SHADOW-Katharine Hamill- Knopf ( $2 ) . <P> Promises made by most first novels are rash . But the promise of Katharine Hamill 's Swamp Shadow has good collateral behind it . Her tale of poor whites on Mississippi 's Gulf Coast is neither dreary case-history nor melodrama plastered together with notebook dialect , but an ably written , objectively presented story of some forgotten men &; women of the U. S. <P> Her white trash are authentic but attractive . Old Man Roper , unregenerate patriarch , had fathered a rascally and shiftless brood . Thomas lived off in the swamp by himself , distilling shinny and drinking what he did not have to sell . Bart had not been improved by going to the War . He got a half-wit girl in trouble , killed her father and pinned the murder on her . Only decent ones in the family were Rachel , who took good care of Old Man Roper and her pining sisters , and Cully , her half-nephew , who liked engines , planned to be a mechanic . <P> But swampy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with a fey young farmer , Bill , who left her to mind the place while he lived a masculine life of hunting and drinking . And Cully found he wanted Rachel , his half-aunt , more than anything else . Rachel was flattered but firmlv faithful . When at last Bill came home and found Cully there , they had a fight , and Bill was killed . Rachel was going to turn Cully in to the sheriff , but Old Man Roper had better sense .
