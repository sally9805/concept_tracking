SUCH SWEET SORROW A STORY BY SELMA ROBINSON T HEIR lawyer 's name was Lefkow- itz , and he discussed the many ways with them . They sat on a black leather bench and talked about it as if it had to do with somebody else . Dwight sat there , asking all sorts of questions , and she herself asked questions ; but the whole time it seemed as if they were talking of someone else 's divorce . She could see herself , young and smartly dressed , asking about Paris and Reno , and one part of her heard Lefkowitz and the two of them , but the other part of her was numb and unbelieving . This could n't be what had become of Dwight and Dinah . Quickly if I can remember the right word or the right name I can make us all wake up , she thought , desperately trying to hold the vanishing thing . It was quite evident that Paris , Reno , and Mexico cost too much and took more time than she could afford from her job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Do you think , " Dinah suggested when the lawyer had left the office for a moment , " Mr. Lefkowitz is above collusion ? " Dwight shouted , " Above collusion ? He is n't even above water . " Lefkowitz told them they did n't need a co-respondent . Who gets a co-respondent nowadays ? It was a waste of good money to get one . " All you need , " he said waving hishairy hands about , " is two witnesses who 'll swear in court they caught him with a woman . Ai n't you got friends who can testify for you ? Takes only a few minutes . " But Dinah began to cry , wishing it all over and done with or never begun . " Look here , I 'll stand for collusion because we ca n't help ourselves . But I draw the line at perjury . If you do n't like it . . . " she threatened , her voice growing louder . She thought , even now , if we could pick it up where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we 'll have a real woman . You have a bride at a wedding , do n't you ? Let 's spare no expense . A man should n't be a piker at his first divorce . I 'll get Jim Coburn and Trafford as witnesses . You just leave it to Dwightie . " He put her in a cab and paid the driver and she drove off , still crying . " I 'll telephone you one of these days , " he called after her . And two weeks later here he was on the telephone . Miss Benton handed the ' phone over . " It 's Mr. Scott calling you , Mrs. Scott , " she said , and left the office with a little parade of discretion that trumpeted **28;284;TOOLONG . " Hello , " said Dinah , " how are you , darling ? " Dwight 's voice replied , saying something or other brightly . She asked , " How 's business ? " " Great . I just got a fifteen per cent cut . What do you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart . " I knew you 'd make good , " she answered . His laugh was ready . " Drop around for a highball this afternoon and I 'll have a pleasant surprise . " " What , Dwight ? " " I 'm not allowed to tell , Honey . " This was the young Dwight , the childish Dwight . " You 'll come ? And at the same time you can take some of your things off my hands . I expect Jim and Trafford too . " " I 'll come for a little while , " she said , " to say hello to everybody . " At quarter of four Di signed her last letter , put on a hat shaped like a pancake , and told Miss Benton she 'd be back before five thirty , but not to wait . It was only seven blocks to Thirty-eighth Street , but she took a cab anyway , to finish her face . In her mirror she saw a face she was sick to death of , pretty , of course , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on like sealing wax and it 's bright and tight and never changing  --  the lipstick , the rougeless cheeks , the black , straight brows with , of late , a frown between  --  and you yank it away and it hurts . And what 's beneath I 'd be curious to see , she thought . The brows drawing tighter together would show anxiety . Or unhappiness . Or ordinary irritability . And the wide red mouth expressed sophistication or generosity or something . The dark blue eyes , that 's for rosemary . Put them all together they spell Di4-n-ah , a word that means the world to  --  to whom ? Certainly not to me , she thought . Nor to Dwight ? Just what am I to Dwight , she wondered , and what is he to me ? We 've always lived in a kind of dark , and I never could find him no matter where I looked . And now the darkness widening between . At the very beginning lie must have been closer . Or did he merely appear close because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring from some source of light , penetrating and burning . He was sun , he was a tall tree , he was a mountain . He was none of these , she admitted after the years of reaching through the dark . His laughter was only laughter , light as foam . He himself was restless light , like the reflection of light from her mirror which danced over the cab . Oh , the parties and the parties that started as this one might start , with a highball or two or three , and a telephone call or three or four . And Dwight the life of the party , singing in a throbbing sweet voice " A Ten Thousand Dollar Bill " or clowning The Flying Trapeze . The drinks on drinks , the hours crawling dismally until the last guest left the smoky , messy rooms . And Dwight sprawled over the sofa , coatless and unshod , his fair hair tumbled . It was his very hair , tumbled and childish , that held her for a long time after it made him look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently she learned that this , too , was wrong . He was not a small boy , not helpless at all . It was she who was helpless , who needed him , one way or another . But now that she had no need of him it was much worse . She should have persisted in needing him . For now he was smoke-writing on the sky , blurred and evanescent ; he was the place where light had been and was no longer . She snapped her vanity case shut and reached for change . The doorman who opened the cab for her was new and he insisted on announcing her . It was almost six months since she had been to Dwight 's apartment . Dwight 's apartment , just because she had done the walking out . He would n't have walked out , though , she reflected . Nothing would have affected him that intensely . Jimmy opened the door , unexciting as ever , with his habitual worried look on his gentle face . " Di , " he kissed her on the cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hat . " " How are you , Mr. Coburn , darling ? And how 's Myra ? And the kids ? " " Excellent . Myra sends her love . " The shades were drawn in the living room and it was dim . Dwight and his younger cousin , Trafford , rose as she entered . They looked almost like twins despite the three years ' difference between them . She kissed them both pleasantly . Dwight turned on the lamp with a flourish . " Look . My surprise , " he said and then , pointing dramatically , " there is the despoiler of your home , the woman who , to all intents and purposes , has ravaged your husband . Mrs. Scott , may 1 present Madame X ? " Dinah turned slowly away from him and back to him again , shaking her head and staring at him hard . " Oh , Dwight , " she said , " need you have ? " " What 's the matter , Angel ? " She said , " You might have told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? She 's leaving just as soon as she finishes her drink , are n't you Xie ? " The girl on the day-bed nodded to Dwight . Then she smiled at Di . " Pleased to meet you , " she said , as if she were typewriting the words . She was a stiff little thing , not even pretty , with yellow thin hair overwhelmingly curled . She wore a negligee over her tailored suit . Peach-colored shiny satin . Ostrich feathers not quite so vehemently peach . Her face was made of paper , sharply creased at the corners of the mouth , too brightly colored . " How do you do , " Di said perfunctorily . " She teaches Sunday School . She 's got her uniform on under her wrapper , " Dwight pointed out . The girl smiled feebly . " He 's kidding , " she said . " Why do you wear your suit under that kimono ? " he asked . " I got a date , " she answered . " See what happens to illusions , Di @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never dreamed a woman of sin would turn out to be a respectable business woman under her wrapper . " " Listen , " said the girl , " do n't woman of sin me . How do you get that way ? " Trafford stirred highballs for them and handed them round . " To Madame X , " he declaimed , raising his glass . Well , if this was the way it was going , Di thought , putting on her party look . " ' What 's the matter with me , am I a creeple ? " she demanded . " To Di , " said Trafford . " And me ? " asked Dwight , delighted she was responding . " Drink your own toast , " his cousin replied . " I always dunk it , " said Dwight . Dinah shoved the ice cubes away with her tongue and looked at Dwight over the top of her glass . Good-looking and just beginning to look dissipated in an attractive way  --  lean face , a suggested puffiness under the eyes . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effortlessly to his fine ankles . It is a superb body , and I should know , she nodded to herself . But now she surveyed him as if he were hers no longer , comparing him with Traff , who was beautiful too , and with Jim , grown a little soft with contentment . " How long 've you been married , Jim ? " she asked . " Eight years . " " Twice as long as Dwight and I. " " Eighteen times as long as I 'll ever be married , " Trafford said . " He does n't believe in marriage , " Dwight explained . " Ai n't he cute ? He 's only twenty-six . " " Do you believe in marriage , Madame X ? " Dinah inquired . " I sure do . And how . " " How ? " asked Di , suddenly wanting to know . The girl hesitated . " Well , children . A house Keeping house . I do n't know . A husband . " " A husband ! How quaint . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband and my marriage never seemed to take . " " I guess you never expected it to . " Di set down her glass on the floor . The drink had warmed her . That might be true . It sounded as though it might actually be true . The proper name or the word , the elusive word The girl went on importantly , " When I marry , it 's going to be for good . No looking ahead for the end . I 'm going to find out how to keep my marriage going , not how to finish it , believe me . " " I believe you . " " Me , too , " said Dwight . " Traff , how about you ? " " What ? " " How about you ? Do you believe in Madame X ? " " Oh , sure , I believe in her . She 's one of my firmest convictions . " Jim passed them fresh highballs and they drank silently for a while . Di rose . " Can you kindly tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said daintily . Madame X rose , too . " Excuse me . I 'll go along , my hands are kind of sticky and besides I got to powder my nose , " the murmured , following Di . They went through the bedroom . It was dismantled , all except for the slender mahogany bed ; Dinah had twin , The bathroom was neat , with Dwight 's things arranged as he always had wanted them . The girl turned the water on in the basin , elaborately , considerately , and talked above it . " Listen , do n't blame him for it . I hung around by myself just kind of playing with my drink , see ? I wanted to get a look at you . " " Just why ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I heard your husband say you were coming around four , so I waited because it was nearly four . You certainly got a nice place here , have n't you ? Your husband is nice-looking , too . I thought I would kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinah was silent . " Listen , " said the girl , " did I hurt your feelings ? Because if I did and it 's none of my business , just tell me to shut up . " " I 'm flattered by your interest . I was merely wondering about you . Do you do this often ? " There must be all sorts of people , undertakers and gravediggers and garbage collectors . " No , only when I can . Most people do n't use co-respondents any more . I got a part-time selling job in a store . " " When will you be married ? " " In five months . February . " " Will you stop this then ? " " Oh , sure ; my friend do n't believe in women working . " She pinched up her mouth and shook her head to show her friend 's disapproval . " You been working long ? " " Before and during and since our marriage . " The girl looked perplexed . " That 's funny . He did n't make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression and all , I mean . " Dinah smiled . " Not that , precisely . But it was a good job , and pretty good fun . " " I see , " said the girl , not seeing at all . She washed her hands , bending over the basin . When she straightened up she caught Di 's reflection in the minor of the medicine chest . They smiled . The girl said , " You going to get married again ? " " Do you think I should ? " Di was unsmiling . Madame X deliberated . " Well , I do n't know . If I was you . What 's the matter with the marriage you got now ? " " I believe they call it incompati-bility . " " What do you mean  --  drinks , runs around with women ? He do n't beat you or anything , does he ? " " No , he does n't beat me . Maybe he should . And the drinking is annoying but not fatal . And I 'm not fool enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even that would n't bother me if I were Wife Number One . But none of us means anything to him . " Site washed her hands , drying them slowly . " You know what I think ? You promise not to tell ? He 's not a person at all . He 's the inside of a soap bubble . He 's what 's inside a broken Easter egg . One day I broke the shell and I found out . " Madame X nodded her head slowly . " You know what I think ? You promise not to tell ? Well , I think you 're in love with him yet ! " " No , that 's wrong . You 've been reading too many women 's magazines . The thing I 'm in love with is what I used to think we were with each other . God , I made an awful fool of myself over it , whatever it was . I used to try to define the thing that was forcing us apart . I used to think , if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I could n't find it . Well , we 're not unique , 1 guess . Funny , we 're the third couple we know to get a divorce in the last six months . " " Funny , nothing , " said the girl . " You 're all suffering from the same sickness . What 's the bunch of you going to do now ? Swap partners ? " " I might try it once more . " " Yeah , sure . Once more . Only do n't be surprised if you do n't get nothing better . Or if you do n't get nothing at all . Listen . Every guy that makes a pass at a married woman ai n't so anxious to grab her up when she 's single . If I was to fall for every fellow who patted my knee ? " " I wo n't ever be surprised at anything again , " Dinah said , leading the way out of the bathroom . The three men rose like jumping jacks when they re-entered the room . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go over our mortal goods , " Di suggested . " Tell them about your operations , Xie . " Dwight finished the rest of his drink and took Di 's arm . Their things were heaped on the bedroom floor . " Household necessities , " necessary no longer : aluminum pots and pans , silver , a jelly mold shaped like a fish . There was the sword plant in the copper bowl . They had not expected it to live , but here it was outlasting their marriage . They began dividing the silver , half to Di , half to Dwight . The forks and knives made a great clatter and brought Jim and Traff in from the living room . " They 're robbing the place , " Trafford whispered hoarsely . " The stuff is n't genuwine . We keep our real jewels in the vault . " " Dwight says he 's moving next month . We 're breaking up house . You gave me these books , Dwight . Does that mean they 're mine , or yours ? " " Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take them . " She laid the books in stacks of twenty . Now she came on some signed " Dwight and Dinah 's book . " Shropshire Lad . Grimm 's Fairy Tales . Ethan Frame . " I must have that , " Dinah cried . " I have n't read it in years . " Two and a half years ago , she recalled , when Dwight was home with ptomaine , and she thought he was going to die . My throat hurt from reading out loud . But I would n't stop because you enjoyed it so . We 've come a Iong way since then . And what 've we done with the thing we had then ? What was it , anyway ? But she said , after her little moment of silence , " Maybe not . The binding 's pretty well shot . I have n't much book room anyway . " Madame X came into the room , without her kimono , looking like Miss Benton or Miss What's-her-name , the stenographer in the outer office . " Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " can I go now ? " " Stick around . We 're going to have some fun soon . " It was Dwight 's old protest against the breaking up of parties . " Anyway , here 's something for you . " He gave her Ethan Frome . " It 's a book . " " It 's a good book . You read it out loud to your young man and he 'll never leave you . " " Listen , he 'd leave me quick if I ever read him anything . He once hauled off at me because I read the funny papers out loud . " " Oh , that 's quite different . Quite , quite different . There , take another book . Take eight or nine . " She held them in one arm , turning her head to drink the highball in her right hand . " Say , Di , what about giving me these book-ends ? " suggested Trafford . " And these ash-trays ? " She gave them to him . To Jim she gave a Wedgwood platter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom closet , brought out an overnight bag . " What 's in it , Di ? " " I ca n't think . Probably belonged to a maid . Look and see . " He opened it and held up a navy-blue dress , grotesquely old-fashioned , with a front that lapped over . " Look what I found . Your maternity dress . You would go right out and buy it . And the very next week Our Little One turned out to be nothing but a cold . Give it to Madame X. She 'll make use of it some day . " " Continuously , if she keeps her word , " said Traff . Di folded it carefully and gave it to the girl . Maybe we should have had one . Not that it would have made much difference the way things turned out . But I 'd have had something left of what there was between us . She looked over all the things they had owned . Lamps . Anyone could have bought them . Silver bowl . Copper and pewter bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polka-dotted glasses , everything , everything . There was n't a thing that could n't be bought by anyone at all . And when it 's divided and given away , there 's nothing left , there 's never been anything . Nothing remained but an indentation in a pillow that the maid fluffed up . And the times I felt close to him , the times I needed him desperately , the times I thought I had him to keep were just sounds that vanished into the meat we ate or the beds we slept in or the chairs we sat in . Sharp essence that we should have distilled , it 's too late now , she thought , seeing Dwight no more hers than any other nice-looking boy . The laughter and the shouting do n't mean anything to me now . Some day I'l even try to remember what we were like together . Madame X was giggling foolishly . " This little intellectual wants another drinkie . " " This Little intellectual is going to get a kick in the panties if she does n't shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xie is all right , are n't you , Madame ? " said Dwight . " A great woman , are n't you ? " " And how . " " She says and how . ' " " Does she really ? " Trafford was astonished . " And how , " said the girl . Dwight gave her a chintz sofa cushion . " Put this under you when you read to your young man . " Di called out , drinking the rest of her fourth highball , or was it the third , or the fifth , " Give her the piano . Perhaps he 's musical . Might as well have a baby as a grand piano in a small apartment . But I should appreciate the dining room furniture . I have to sit on the floor to eat off my end-table now . " " The Chinese sit on the floor to quaff their ceremonial tea , " Traff volunteered . " It was the Japanese , " Dwight said . Madame X tittered that she could never tell them apart . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , precious , have a book . " He gave her Look Homeward , Angel . She studied the title . " That reminds me , " she said , " can I go home now ? I got a date . " Traff had a date , too , and he left with her , the peach satin wrapper over his arm , waving good-night to them all . " It 's after six , I 've got to beat it myself , " Dwight said , his mouth unsteady with too much Scotch . " After six ! I told Miss Benton I 'd call her . " " Call her all day to-morrow . So long , darling . " He came to her and kissed her familiarly , expertly . It 's just the way he kisses , easily and well ; it does n't mean a thing , she thought . But the true kiss , the deep laughter , the quick clasp and the rare quiet moments , the sweet , sweet times we had once in awhile . We should have done something with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , she thought , and getting maudlin . Soon I 'll be remembering those nights in Sorrento in the balcony scene of Act II . " Good-night , Jim , " he said , and to Di , again , " I 'll call you at your office , next week , darling , for lunch . " ( Next week . And after that next month . Next year . Next century . Never more . So long , darling , she thought . ) " Slam the door hard as you go out . " After he left , Jim said , " Come and have dinner with Myra and me . " " No , thanks , darling . " " Please , Dinah . You look a little weary . We 'll all go to some new place . " " No , please , Jim , really . " " Come out and get a drink then . " " Well , a drink . " She powdered her nose and the little puffs under her eyes . She used Dwight 's mouth-wash and brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was neatly divided now . Hers . His . The books , the silver , the furniture . Grouped that way , they looked like so little . Two trunks , a few packing cases , and the furniture . " I used to think we had so much , " she said , puzzled , " and yet every stick we owned is right here . It actually takes very little to make a home , does n't it ? " Jim held the door open for her . She looked back . " Wait a minute . I 'm convinced we 've forgotten something . " The books , the lamps , the furniture . Room by room now . Living room . It was all there . Dining room . Bedroom . Kitchen . Yes , that was right Then nothing was forgotten . " I could have sworn that we had something more , " she said apologetically , shaking her head . Then she slammed the door hard .                  @ @ @
