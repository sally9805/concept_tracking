Upstairs and downstairs and into the First Lady 's chamber went two workmen last week , lugging shiny green holly wreaths , one for each window of the White House . Downstairs all was Christmas rush . Bookkeeper Henry Nesbitt listed stacks of early gifts ; Housekeeper Mrs. Nesbitt thumbed over the State linen , bargained with tradesmen , checked the storeroom 's loaded shelves of cans and bottled goods . The cook pirouetted with dignity around the 24-foot electric stove , carefully sniffed the game rack , where hung pheasants , quail , ducks , grouse , and woodcocks waiting till they were high enough for a President 's taste . <P> In the mailroom clerks stiffened their sinews to grapple with the hundreds of thousands of cards and gifts-from fruitcake and ship models to luggage and buck deer-that stack up every year , the week before Christmas . Secret Service men could infinitesimally relax : Christmastime is a slow season for cranks &; crackpots . <P> By plane and train from all over the U. S. gathered the Roosevelt clan , some two dozen strong-with newest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his first look at his famous grandfather . Ready as always was Grandmother Eleanor , her activities for the holiday week scheduled to the minute-six public Christmas tree ceremonies , three religious services , three celebrations in New York City , three separate White House children 's parties . <P> Ready were the traditional red stockings that every Roosevelt , child and grownup , hangs over the fireplace in the President 's second-floor bedroom . On Christmas Eve , after the children have kissed " Grandpa " good night , the elder Roosevelts stuff the stockings . Into each toe goes a toothbrush , a nailfile , a gaily wrapped bar of soap-vestiges of a custom that Mrs. Roosevelt began , as a sugar-coated reminder of cleanliness , when her six-footer sons were little tads . <P> On the vast , waxy-gleaming floor of the East Room , where Mrs. John Adams once hung the White House wash , stood an enormous Christmas tree . This was the public tree , trimmed in white snow and white lights . Upstairs in the second-floor corridor stood the family tree , brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches , out of children 's reach . Below it will mass breast-high stacks of family gifts . <P> The White House Christmas settles into its stride on Christmas Eve . In the afternoon the President will make a brief national broadcast , and light the National Community Christmas tree . After dinner Franklin Roosevelt , a longtime lover of Tiny Tim , reads aloud to his family Charles Dickens ' Christmas Carol . <P> As soon after dawn as is seemly , the pajama-clad small fry whoop into " Grandpa 's " bedroom , bounce on his bed , shout " Merry Christmas , " and dive for the bulging red stockings hanging from the mantelpiece . After breakfast ( smoked sausages and scrambled eggs ) the President and the immediate family motor around old Lafayette Square to the grey granite St. Thomas Episcopal Church .
