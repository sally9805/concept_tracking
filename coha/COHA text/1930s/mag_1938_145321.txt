William Schmidt has cooked 25,000 meals for himself on the same wood stove . Typical repast : " fish chowder " ( boiled onions , rice , a can of sardines ) . William Schmidt , 68 , is knotty with muscle and so bent from years and decades of working in a tunnel that he can hardly straighten up . But last week mining men were saying that he had accomplished the greatest one-man mining achievement in the history of engineering . <P> In 1906 William Schmidt staked 24 gold , silver and copper claims in a remote part of California 's Black Mountain . The ore veins looked rich , but miles of costly road would have been needed to get the ore around the mountain to a shipping point . Lacking capital , William Schmidt decided to tunnel through the mountain - alone . For 32 years he worked on his bore , using only blasting powder , hand drills and picks . Like the builders of the great Colorado River Aqueduct , he had to learn as he went along . At the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools . But he learned how . Last week the tunnel was finished - 2,000 ft. through solid rock . William Schmidt expected at last to make some money from his claims . <P> For 32 years William Schmidt has lived in a shack which is now plastered inside with magazine and rotogravure pictures . <P> Outside , patches of tin show where he has removed boards for use in his tunnel . In the summers he worked on a ranch to get money for more tunneling . For clothing he used garments discarded by other prospectors , patched them with flour sacking . He does not smoke or chew , but takes a nip of wine occasionally . He has never , he says , been lonely . Once he came stumbling into the shack of a neighbor , shaking and bloody . " Bad cave in , " he said . " Nearly got me that time . "
