txt Several correspondents inquire respecting the proposals that the Federal Reserve System increase the supply of credit by purchasing a considerable quantity of government securities with the double object of improving the investment market for second-grade bonds , and stiffening the commodity price level . Highly respectable authority supports these proposals and equally respectable authority opposes them . This writer will not undertake to decide the dispute , but it may be helpful to attempt to show what the proposals involve . First , as to the investment market : suppose the Federal Reserve system to purchase $100 , - 000,000 government securities . The , ? frect is to send an equal sum of money  --  credit  --  in search of some other investment . Normally the impulse thus given travels through the entire structure and travels downwards , that is , it tends to send investors experimenting with securities of a lower grade . A notable example of this was the conversion of British Consols to 23A ? , ; - for 17 years , and then to Investors . ' Habits Changed Chancellor Goschen some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abundant credit , and the result was to create a veritable boom in the investment market which led to the flotation of some hundreds of industrial companies led by the extraordinarily successful flotation by the Rothschild firm of the famous Guinness Brewery . Here it was not a case of additional credit , but the lowering of the rate of return on some hundreds of millions of England 's premier security produced exactly the same disturbance of the investment market as would have followed a large increase in the amount of capital for investment . It changed the habits of investors Now one difficulty with such an operation at this time is that this time is abnormal in that lack of Lonfidence in anything but the highest class of security is its dominant characteristic . This being so , a merely physical impulse from a purchase of securities by the Federal Reserve System would meet " metaphysical " resistance so long as the causes which affect " confidence : * continue to operate . It is impossible to measure the force of these causes so as to determine whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is remembered that as a result of the " bonus " payments and the Treasury deficit , at least $500,000,000 of extra " credit " has been pumped into the situation since the beginning of the year with no visible results worth mentioning- in the seconaary bond market -- until within a couple of weeks  --  the metaphysical factor seems to dominate . Happily Mr. Hoover 's move has done much to weaken its force and will probably do more . In the circumstances the experiment of further application of " physical . " force might be justified . Second , as to the commodity price level ; here we are upon less sure ground , and ground of another kind- It is not a question of introducing a disturbance in the investment market , but a question of depreciating the exchange-value of the money-unit which is quite another thing . It is , in a word , " inflation " that is meant but Inflation short of a crude abondonment of the gold-standardQuestions On The Price-Equation The theory is that by increasing the volume of money-credit the money-commodity equation will necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit is made available . But how much will be necessary ? And is this sort of thing a proper function of the Federal Reserve System ? And if it were a. proper function , how would the System perform it ? By what method would it increase the circulating medium ? Such an increase would be necessary to be really effective upon commodity prices , unless other factors were at work upon commodities themselves . Here again we touch the metaphysical confidence . Short of a definite abandonment of gold as the money-unit and its replacement by " managed " currencies , it seems that commodity prices will be governed largely by the metaphysical factor plus such physical factors as may come into operation upon the commodities themselves . We are certainly not yet ready for " managed " currencies however appealing may be the theory on which " management " should proceed . Hope for improvement in the commodity price level seems to lie in the increase of general " confidence " and in control of production , - particularly in the production of necessaries , where consumptive demand per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might result from the experiment with the investment market above described is a not unreasonable assumption .
