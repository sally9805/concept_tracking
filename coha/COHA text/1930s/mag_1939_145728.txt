OUR LIVES HAVE JUST BEGUN-Henry Myers-Stokes ( $2.50 ) . <P> Among the world 's lost causes , none was more fantastic than the Children 's Crusade . The least glorious pilgrimage in religious history , it has been mostly lost to literature as well . The exception is that macabre legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin , invented by satirical 13th Century peasants . <P> The Children 's Crusade might be the subject for a fine work of imaginative realism . Our Lives Have Just Begun attempts instead a piece of reverent irony-the story of a French shepherd boy who , mistaking a joking troubadour for God , is inspired to start the first Children 's Crusade to Jerusalem . He recruits tens of thousands of moppets , sweeps across France like a locust plague , accepts slave-traders ' transportation to the Holy Land as a miracle , dies of fever as the flabbergasted Caliph of Bagdad good-humoredly pretends to surrender in the name of the Virgin Mary . <P> The publishers ' readers " made bold to class this unusual first novel with The Bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is something less than accurate . The main aptness of the comparison is that Author Myers ' story also collapses , too lightly constructed to support its load of symbolism .
