txt Joseph P. Kennedy , multi-milWashington lionaire ace BilerfMr7MAIW ? 777.7. trouble shooter for the administration , late today accepted the post of ambassador to Great Britain . The chairman of the maritime commission and former chairman of the Securities and Exe h an g e commission , delivered his acceptance to President Roosevelt in a hurriedly arranged conference . No official announcement of the acceptance was made , however , because the post is not officially vacant . Ambassador Robert Worth Bingham , Louisville publisher , has not yet re signed , or at least his resignation has not been accepted . White House Silent . For this reason the White House and the state department maintained a strict silence over the impending diplomatic change . Kennedy also kept his lips tightly sealed . It is expected that Kennedy will leave for the court of St. James 's in January . His departure hangs upon the finding of a successor for his post the ' Maritime commission . Kennedy made up his mind to go to London over night . The post was offered to him yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surprise of his friends , who did not believe he would put so great a distance between himself and his extensive interests in this country . See Political Implications . The appointment was seen here as laden with significant political implications at home and abroad . Kennedy is known as one of the few common sense men in the group of presidential advisers , and has struggled throughout his government service with brain trusters and other extremists to bring about a more conservative Democratic program .

The suave but hard hitting Boston boy who pulled himself from a $25 a week job to an eight figure fortune is not expected to don knee breeches and fall under the spell of British flattery . Instead , he can be counted upon , his friends say , to squeeze the last cent out of the tail of the British lion . In this connection Kennedy may be expected to press for resumption of war debt payments . Kennedy has been a close friend of the President since the latter was assistant secretary of the navy during the war and Kennedy was aligned with shipbuilding interests . In 1932 he was a heavy contributor to the Roosevelt campaign fund both before and after nomination at Chicago . When the SEC was organized Ken . nedy was selected to set it in motion . After launching the unit Kennedy retired to private life and money making . He was recalled to organize the maritime commission and was planning to leave this task when the ambassadorship was offered him . Kennedy will be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country rit Zt .
