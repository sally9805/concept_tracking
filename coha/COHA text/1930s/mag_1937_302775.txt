Anyone who throws a human corpse into the waters around Cleveland can be fined $50 , sent to the workhouse for 30 days for violation of a health ordinance . More than likely , anyone who thus polluted Cleveland 's waters would be guilty of murder too , would therefore be prosecuted under Ohio 's murder statutes instead of Cleveland 's health ordinance . Nevertheless , last week when the corpse of a woman , from which the head , arms and legs had been expertly cut , was found in the shallow waters of Lake Erie at Cleveland , police announced that they could use nothing more drastic than the health ordinance against the murderer . This was true , they said , because what they had of the corpse was unidentifiable . <P> Cleveland 's police did not make this startling announcement out of callousness , nor were they taking lightly the atrocious murder . They made their statement apparently in desperation , on the slim chance that the butcher-murderer would show himself when he learned that his punishment would be so light . Reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighth that had been found in Cleveland since September 1934 , when Torso No. 1 , also that of an unknown female , similarly butchered , was found at the same spot . The other six-five males , one female-all dismembered , only two of them identified - were found in the desolate Kingsbury Run section , through which Cleveland 's rapid transit line speeds prosperous Clevelanders to swank Shaker Heights . At last week 's end , Cleveland police admitted they were as hopelessly without clues to Cleveland 's butcher as they were three years ago .
