He also denied that any part of $30,839 in checks other than for salary and pension came from profits in the Moto Inn , near Croton , ' in which Samuel Seabury , counsel of the committee , charged he was a partner . Wright , who admitted testifying in private that hundreds of dollars might be paid for protection in the inspector 's office without his knowing it and that " a cop is only the crumbs on the table , " had bank deposits which totaled $99,240.53 during the last eleven years . He offered an entirely new kind of explanation for the $39,561 cash deposits during that period by testifying that he had obtained $25.000 from his brother Patrick , who formerly kept a hotel " for gentlemen only " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Patrick Manning , whom he described as " a seafaring man , " for a building operation in the Bronx . Wright added that his brother watt dead and that Manning , who , when he last heard from him , was in Philadelphia . probably was now on the high seas in a ship the name of which he did not know . Admits Sister Owns Inn . Questioned by Mr. Seabury , Wright explained the deposit of checks other than for salary and pension by saying that he had obtained a loan of $18,500 from the Railroad Building and Loan to help finance his Bronx construction project , and also had received financial aid from his two sisters in Westchester County . After considerable parrying , he admitted that one of his sisters , Margaret , owned the Moto Inn , land and building , but replied in the negative when Mr. Seabury asked if he knew it as a speakeasy and denied that he had any interest in the place . Wright had a complete lapse of memory when asked about a controller 's check of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and endorsed by him to Mabel Moto , who presumably has some connection with Moto Inn . The witness said he did not know Mabel Moto . Under pressure of Mr. Seabury 's questioning , he seemed to try to recall the transaction but said he could not remember anything about this check . " Now , officer , " said Mr. Seabury in concluding the examination , " is n't all this money that has been showh in these bank accounts , aggregating nearly $100,000 , the savings that you were able to tuck away chiefly while you were collecting when you were attached to the Eighth Division ? " " No. sir , you are mistaken , " Wright replied . " And is n't this Moto Inn a speakeasy up there in which you have been a partner since 1924 ? " " You have got . the wrong information , " answered Wright . The Democratic members of the committee failed to come to the assistance of this witness , as is the custom of some of them , when Mr. Seabury finished his questioning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " said Senator John J. , when Wright attempted to give second account of borrowing money for his building project . Liberty League Official Queried . Earlier in the afternoon Charles A. Schultz , president of the Bronx branch of the Liberty League , denied that membership furnished protection against arrests by the police for liquor law violations . The league was largely a social organization , he said , and its purpose was to bring about a change in the prohibition law . " Do you still have hope that the law will be changed ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " Yes , I have , " said Mr. Schultz . " I hope you will realize your hope , " interjected Assemblyman Irwin Steingut , Democratic leader of the Assembly . Mr. Schulz said he had been in the saloon and restaurant business from the time he retired as a policeman in 1911 until his retirement from business on June 10 , 1929 , after an arrest for the sale of liquor was made in his place . He denied that he had paid money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could recall was one of $10 to Lieutenant Albert J. Stroh of the inspector 's staff , which was repaid . The witness said the league was an outgrowth of the Retail Liquor Dealers ' Association and now had only about twenty-five members left in the Bronx . Mr. Seabury moved in the forenoon to force Russell T. Sherwood , Mayor Walker 's personal accountant , to appear in Supreme Court Friday to show cause why he should not be fined up to $100,000 for failure to answer a subpoena of the committee . Mr. Seabury filed in Supreme Court affidavits to show that Sherwood had been served by publication in accordance with Justice Edward J , Glennon 's order . The order is returnable before Justice Ernest E. L. Hammer . It has been published in THE NEW YORK TIMES and The New York Herald Tribune once a week for the last six weeks . In anticipation of a fine , Mr. Seabury has caused all property of Mr. Sherwood that could be located in this State to be attached to an estimated value of between $15,000 and $30,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointly by Mayor Walker and Mr. Sherwood , but has not asked as yet for legal authority to open it . Wright El at Ease on Stand . Wright appeared ill at ease , but very alert mentally when Mr. Seabury questioned him . He said he retired from the Police Department in June , 1929 , a short time after he had been transferred from the Eighth Division by order of William J. Lahey , then chief inspector . The witness resisted attempts by Mr. Seabury to get him to say that Lieutenant Stroh , under whom he had worked , brought about the transfer and that he must " have stepped on the toes " of the lieutenant in some liquor case . Wright took refuge in a faulty recollection when Mr. Seabury read him his answers to questions in a private examination and said that Irving Ben Cooper , Mr. Seabury 's assistant in charge of the police inquiry . " sprang " questions so quickly that he could not recall what they were or just what he had answered . Wright finally said that his belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was quite an argument , " the witness said . The witness admitted that he had told Mr. Cooper that patrolmen were " small fry " and that hundreds of dollars could be paid in the inspector 's office without his knowing anything about it . " You would not stand by silently when others would get paid without getting something for yourself ? " Mr. Cooper asked at the private inquiry , according to the record read by Mr. Seabury . " I would have to , " Wright replied , according to this record . " A cop is only merely the crumbs on the table . " Mr. Seabury asked the witness if he remembered these questions and answers . " Yes , there was something like that put to me , " Wright replied . Wright was equally hazy regarding what he had said when questioned by Mr. Cooper about what " the price of a hat " meant in the Police Department . " That expression price of a hat means the price of a hat , " Wright testified in private . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , Wright replied : " Well , the price of a hat may be 50 cents , 75 cents , $1.50 , or it might be $50 . " " Have n't you heard while you were in the Police Department the term used as indicsting a payment of $100 to the patrolman or plain clothes man who was detailed to visit a speakeasy ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " No , sir , " replied the witness . Queried on Liberty League . Questioned about the Liberty League , Wright said he knew little about it , but admitted that he had told Mr. Cooper that he had seen Schultz around the police station and that he never had had " inside information " about the league . Wright said that since he had been out of the department , his only sources of income were his pension of $1,250 a year , rents of $170 a month , dividends of $100 a year and between $2,200 and $2,600 from various police benevolent associations . Mr. Seabury produced transcripts of his accounts with the Corn Exchange Bank Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed cash deposits of $2,386 in 1922 , $2,000 in 1923 , $6,756 in 1924 , $858 in 1925 , $400 in 1926 , $10,780 in 1927 , $8.960 in 1928. $5,700 in 1929 , $771 in 1930 and $900 in 1931 . Mr. Seabury called Wright 's attention to the cash deposits of $10,780 in 1927 . The witness produced a memorandum book and replied : " I got only the deposits of the Corn Exchange here and I used to draw out of the Emigrant Savings Bank and put it in here in order to fill up my checking account . " " Kind of a battledore and shuttlecock between the Corn Exchange Bank and the Emigrant Bank ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " Yes , at times , " replied the witness . Wright was on the inspector 's staff during 1927 , 1928 and 1929 , and Mr. Seabury called his attention to the great increase from the $400 in cash deposits in 1926 and the $10,780 in cash deposits in 1927 and the equally pronounced drop from the $5,700 cash deposits in 1929 to $771 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that Wright was in active service as a policeman for only six months in 1929 and asked the witness whether that was the explanation for the cash deposits in 1927 being approximately double the cash deposits of 1929 . Tells of Borrowing Cash . " No , it ai n't , " replied Wright . " I can explain that to the satisfaction of every man in this room . " " Where did you get it ? " asked Mr. Seabury . " In 1919 , I was dispossessed , that is , I was put out of the home I was living in by my landlord . I could n't get an apartment to live in . I went to a friend of mine in the Bronx and asked him if he would rent me a Tibor somewhere . He said , ' I will try and look around . ' He looked around and went up to 3,233 Decatur Avenue , a three-story frame building . " It was built on a plot of seven lots . To the back of it was thirtythree feet of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a floor here . ' I says , ' It will suit me . He said , ' They wo n't rent you the floor . You had better buy the building . ' I said , ' How the deuce can I buy the building ? ' I says , ' It is too big for me and I do n't want this ground . ' " ' Well , ' he said , ' we will go and see the agent . ' We went and seen the agent . The agent says , ' Well , I wo n't rent you the floor . ' I hemmed and hawed and hemmed and hawed and finally I said , ' What do you want for the building ? ' I think he wanted $16,000 or $17,000 . I said I could n't buy it . Senator Samuel H. Hofstadter brought out that Wright bought the building and Mr. Seabury brought out that Wright 's friend was his brother . " My brother was in the hotel business and I went down to see him and told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . " I says , ' Now , when you went into the hotel business , I advanced some money to put you in husiness . I did n't ask anything from you . Now are you fit to repay me , ' He says , ' Yes , how much do you want ? ' We bought the building for $15,500 or $16,000 , $2,500 down . ' Brother Gave Him $25,00 . Wright said that his brother repaid him $10,000 which he owed him and lent him $15,000 in addition , taking a note for the loan . " What was your brother 's business ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " Hotel business , Spring and West Streets , " Wright replied . " What kind of a hotel ? " Mr. Seabury continued . " A hotel for gentlemen only , " Wright replied , causing a. burst of laughter which Senator Hofstadter had difficulty in checking . Wright said his brother died in 1923 , 1924 or 1925 , that he never paid interest because his brother had agreed to go in partnership to construct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , who introduced him to Patrick Manning , who lent him $14,000 for the building project . . " What was his business ? " Mr. Seabury asked , referring to Mr. Manning . " He was a seafaring man , " Wright replied , causing more laughter . Paid Back " Seafaring Man . " The witness said he had repaid Manning the entire amount of the loan and had also paid him 5 per cent interest . It later developed that Wright , according to his testimony had paid Manning $8,900 in cash , which he withdrew from the Emigrant Savings Bank on Sept. 10 , just a week after he was called for questioning before Mr. Cooper , and had paid the balance in securities for which he had paid $6,623 . These securities included ten shares each of Pennsylvania Railroad , Kennecott Copper , Irving Trust Company and Gold Dust . Wright said that Manning objected to taking the securities , the value of which had depreciated . He said he told Manning that they all were good stocks and would come back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the loan . Wright said that although his brother left a widow he never had been pressed to repay the money his brother lent him . " The understanding was that we were partners in a building and the building failed , " Wright explained . " Me and my brother never disputed . We were pals . " Denies Being Partner in Inn . Wright insisted that he never knew Mabel Moto , to whom he endorsed the $10,050 check , although he knew the Moto Inn . " You know it as a speakeasy tip in Croton ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " I know it as being a first-class restaurant , " Wright replied . " Is n't Mabel Moto your partner ? " Mr. Seabury inquired . " I do n't know Mabel Moto , " the witness replied . " The inn is named after her , is n't it ? " " I ca n't help it , " Wright said . Wright would not deny that checks for $1,500 , $500 and $6,600 came from Moto Inn , although he said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your family interested in Moto Inn ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " Yes , my sister , Margaret Wright , ' the witness replied . " She owns the property and owns a farm of ground alongside or outside of Peekskill . " " She must have some relation or connection with the inn , has n't she ? " " I do n't know , " replied Wright . " I never butted in . " The hearing will be continued today , when Mr. Seabury will offer more testimony concerning the relations of the police and speakeasies . Murray Birnbaum , former aide of Emanuel Kessler , so-called " king of the bootleggers , " is scheduled to be called as a witness , but there is some doubt that Mr. Seabury will grant him immunity . James F ' . Herold and Henry Schmidt Jr . also are expected to testify .
