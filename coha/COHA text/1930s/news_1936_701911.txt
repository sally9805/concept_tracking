txt The agreement just concluded between the railway managers and their employes , in the matter of a " dismissal wage , " is intended to solve a difficult and highly important problem . It has long been evident that large economies could be made through the merging of railway facilities and the consolidation of competing lines , and that these economies would go far toward rehabilitating the entire transportation industry , enabling it once more to improve its services and to operate at a profit under proper management . But in all these matters the essential difficulty has been the labor question . Mergers and consolidations would eliminate perhaps 150,000 or 200,000 employes . This , in fact , would be the chief saving to be achieved through unification of facilities . Congress refused to recognize the realities of this situation when it enacted the Emergency Transportation Act of 1933 . It took special pains in that legislation to ecourage mergers and consolidations in the interest of economy ; but at the same time it " froze " the labor situation by forbidding the railways to employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in May , 1933 . In other words , Congress proposed that the railways economize , and then made it all but impossible for them to do so . It is small wonder that little progress has been made under the act of 1933 . The question recently has been what to do about the situation thus created , when the act of 1933 expires next June 16 . This question has now been answered by representatives of 85 per cent of the country 's railway mileage and by spokesmen of twenty railway unions . After months of negotiation they have agreed on a plan under which men who lose employment in consequence of consolidations are to receive either a lump sum " separation allowance , " or , for a specified period , a " dismissal wage " ? both of these being based on length of service . In addition , the agreement provides for reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by employes who will be compelled to change their place of residence . Adherence to this agreement will doubtless involve a large expenditure by the railways ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be more than offset in the long run by the economies now made possible . For the employes the agreement at least means time in which to turn around , and very possibly , in many cases , re-employment in their old positions , if mergers and consolidations have their expected result of putting the railways on their feet again . Finally , the general public ought to gain through an improvement of service . That the whole agreement is the result of direct negotiations undertaken in a spirit of moderation , rather than an arbitrary arrangement set up by act of Congress , is not the least interesting and significant feature of the plan . In this connection it is worth remembering that President ROOSEVELT urged a negotiated settlement last March , at a time when a deadlock had apparently been reached . He said then that while legislation has its place , and is often necessary for the welfare of both capital and labor , " it is a remedy to be " taken with great caution , or it may " prove worse than the disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be observed more faithfully in Washington .
