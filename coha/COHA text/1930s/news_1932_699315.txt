txt The Garner proposal for a vote on prohibition repeal Monday suffered a setback today at the hands of the House Judiciary Committee , which voted 13 to 6 against sponsoring the resolution on the floor . Speaker Garner , however , promptly announced his determination " to keep faith with the American people " and force a vote anyway . When informed by Chairman Sumners that he had failed to obtain committee consent , largely because of Democratic votes , to move for suspension of the rules and adoption of the Garner resolution , the Speaker made known that his procedure Monday would be as follows : " I will recognize Mr. Sumners if he desires to be recognized to make the motion to suspend the rules and adopt my resolution . If he does not care to , I will recognize Mr. Rainey , the Democratic leader . " Mr. Garner expressed the view that I " several of those " who voted against the resolution would vote on the other side " when they have to step up and be counted . " Garner Counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome of the vote depends I largely upon - the Republican action Monday , " and added that " a good many Republicans will have to vote with the Democrats to put it over . " He went on : " It is marvelous the number of Democrats who have told me they are going to vote for my resolution . Just go out and poll the Georgia delegation , the Texas delegation , the Missouri and Maryland delegations and you 'll be surprised how many have changed . " I am going through with this thing . My plans have not been altered in the least . I am going to keep faith with the American people . No man living can say I have n't kept faith with my constituency for these many years and this time it is the entire American people . " Seven Democrats , all from Southern States , were among the thirteen who voted against the Judiciary Committee sponsoring the Garner resolution . The negative vote included also six " lame ducks . " The affirmative vote came from four Democrats and two Republicans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEMOCRATS  --  Condon , Rhode Island ; Dieterich , Illinois , and Celler and Oliver , Neal York .

Some committee members were quick to announce that their vote to- day did not mean necessarily that they would vote against the resolution Monday . Representatives Michener and Montague indicated they would vote yes Monday , and Chairman Sumners , who did not vote in committee , said that he would stand for the Garner resolution . Two main reasons were assigned for the committee 's defeating the proposal to instruct Mr. Sumners to make the necessary motion Monday as head of the judiciary body . First was the virtual denial of any chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , the refusal of some Southern Democrats to accede to ratification by State conventions , as set out in the resolution and defined by A. Mitchell Palmer , Attorney General in the Wilson Cabinet , whose brief on the subject was before the committee . Ratification Plan a Stumbling Block . Informal tests were taken as to certain amendments ; some members wanted to put in guarantees ot safety to dry States and others wanted declarations against the open saloon . It soon developed , however , that the one question to be decided by the committee was whether it should or should not sponsor the Garner resolution as it stood . Mr. Tarver reminded the body , also , that it had no status as a committee with Congress not in session , and hence no resolution could be officially recommended . With a certain amount of dissension over the denial of opportunity to amend the measure , the question of the method of ratification entered the discussion to seal finally the resolution 's fate in committee . Mr. Palmer 's brief was blamed by the wets as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had argued that under the prescription of ratification by conventions Congress would have full power over such agencies as to their form , their make-up , the selection of their delegates and the time they would be held . Southerners on the committee , most of whom were drys before their party went wet , saw immediately a threat of a revival of the old force acts of reconstruction days . They went back into history and pulled up all the resentment of their forebears to the Federal Government holding elections in the States. % Representative La Guardia said that the objections in committee to the Garner proposal were " captious and technical . " " We did n't do anything but talk , " he declared . " The members became involved in a lot of constitutional gthetieseu k zeragurked WIN that " whatever reasons they give , they are drys , just drys . " Wet-Dry Division Still Strong . Chairman Sumners also thought something fundamental lay behind the technical objections raised in the committee . " The old wet and dry feeling was still very much alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead with his resolution , the antiprohibition forces proposed tonight to move on the House Monday from every sector . The beer-for-revenue bill will probably be introduced the same day and referred to the Ways and Means Committee for hearings . The alcoholic content must advocated around the Capitol has undergone a change within the last few days . The figure most spoken of now is 3.2 by weight , or virtually 4 per cent by volume . Some Ways and Means Committee members said today that this figure was most likely to be included in the blank space for content which is to be left in the first draft of the beer bill . Officials of the Prohibition Bureau practically completed today their hearings before the House Appropriations Committee on the appropriation for enforcement in the fiscal year , 1934 . Meanwhile , agitation was revived to_the curtail this expenditure as an economy move . Senator Hastings , who will introduce a proposal to withdraw enforcement support from States which have repealed their own prohibition statutes , struck back today at the Association for the Retention of Enforcement , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He admitted that technically it might be called both , but he insisted it had the " merit of justice . " Meanwhile the Crusaders sent a letter today to Speaker Garner , setting out the results of their survey on enforcement activities , saying that " to such a low estate has prohibition fallen that only five States are making any effort to enforce the law today . " These were listed as Nebraska , New Hampshire , Ohio , South Carolina and Virginia . " Three years ago twenty States appropriated money specifically for the enforcement of the Volstead act , " the letter said . " In 1930 the following thirteen States , Alabama , Colorado , Illinois , Kansas , Michigan , Nebraska , New Hampshire , Ohio , Oregon , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Virginia and West Vi ginia , spent $641,000 and employed something over 200 prohibition enforcement officers , together with a few attorneys and chemists . " Now five States are spending only $194,000 and employing 137 officers  --  the 90 in Virginia being mostly on part time .
