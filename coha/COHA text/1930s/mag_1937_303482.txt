From Turkey last week , via the Frankfurter Zeitung , came news that 20,000 stray dogs had last year been cleared off the streets of Istanbul and killed . Travelers lately returned from Istanbul were amazed at the number , having thought that Istanbul 's teeming population of pariah dogs was part of its dead past . <P> Thirty years ago , when Istanbul was Constantinople , visitors to the city found it as overrun with dogs as Hamelin was with rats . Every small section had its band of ten to 25 mongrels-all sizes , shapes and colors-which woke to fighting fury when a dog from another section tried to trespass on its territory . They littered the narrow streets with their droppings , were eternally underfoot , made the night loud with their yapping . But it was part of the Turks ' religion to be kind to animals , and the dogs had been there since Constantinople was Byzantium . <P> Besides , they fulfilled an important civic function . They were the city 's Department of Sanitation , wolfing the garbage which householders deposited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the early sanitary problems which modernizing Young Turks took up was disposal of the Constantinople dogs . No Turk could be found with the heart to kill the creatures . In 1910 , about 40,000 of them were herded onto boats , ferried out to the rocky , uninhabited Island of Oxia in the Sea of Marmora , there left to starve ( see cut ) . For months their piteous barkings echoed across Marmora to the Anatolian shore . A few kindly citizens rowed out with food , but the task was hopeless . <P> As the dogs became frantic with hunger , boatmen grew fearful that the pack would swim out and capsize them , steered clear of the island . Soon the last lean dog gave up gnawing his dead fellows ' bones . <P> For years after this great purge . <P> Istanbul baited its remaining strays with poisoned meat , killing thousands annually . In recent times the city has erected modern pounds where unlicensed dogs are humanely chloroformed or poisoned , with a thoroughgoing round-up every spring . Returning to the Istanbul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Sir Evelyn Wrench was impressed not by dogs but by cats . In London 's Spectator he wrote : <P> " The Turk is not unkind according to his lights . He thinks it cruel to drown litters of kittens , he therefore puts them on the dustheap ! In every side street you meet the cats , old and emaciated cats , cats with one eye blind , kittens toddling with unsteady step , cats with skin diseases , cats eternally scratching themselves , dying cats run over by cars on the roadside . When I asked residents in Istanbul what could be done about the cats , they shrugged their shoulders . ' Istanbul was menaced in its old wooden houses by a plague of rats ; cats were necessary . ' "
