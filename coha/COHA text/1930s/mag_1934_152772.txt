When Sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies was commissioned ( in the will of Mrs. Angelina Crane ) to fashion a statue of Civic Virtue for Manhattan 's City Hall Park , he modeled an upright youth spurning two coiled mermaids who represented Deceit and Disillusion . The unveiling in 1922 caused an unavailing delirium of protests from women 's organizations and others which found , in the sex of Disillusion and Deceit and in their proximity to the youth 's feet , an affront to womanhood . Glad of an opportunity to have fun , Manhattan newspapers exulted in lavish , impartial ridicule , made the incident one of Manhattan 's most famed art squabbles . As late as 1932 Merchant Nathan Straus Jr . was writing to onetime Mayor James John Walker , asking the statue 's removal . <P> Last week , under like circumstances , Rockefeller Center became the butt for town wits and art critics . Installed early last month in the Center 's plaza was a huge gilt Paul Manship statue of Prometheus poised in a swimming pose on a mound and encircled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher Morley in the Saturday Review of Literature wrote of it thus : " I am appalled by the Yiddish Hurdler on the new terrace of Rockefeller City . Under those glorious perpendiculars . . . this gesticulating gigolo in gilt . Besides he is just as immoral as the banished Lenin for the only possible interpretation is that he is escaping from a wedding ring . . . . I ... roared with laughter . " <P> Quick to seize the similarity between the MacMonnies affair and the budding Manship incident , the tabloid Daily Mirror printed an imaginary conversation be tween the two sculptors ' statues , head lined it " PROMETHEUS " BIG SISSY TO " CIVIC VIRTUE , " promised to run further news of the " amazing wrangle .
