txt Our Relations With Cuba . To the Editor of The New York Times : The people of the United States should know that the great majority of the Cuban people hold eternal gratitude for the United States because of the decisive help in our war with Spain which culminated in our independence . The anti-American demonstrations recently held in Cuba were all practically made up of Communists , who know no fatherland , and Spaniards who can never forget the defeat at the hands of the United States Navy at Santiago and at Manila . The Liberals of Cuba , the majority of the Cuban people , desire to state that they continue to feel the same gratitude for the United States , and that they can never forget the sacrifices made to help us obtain our freedom , and that only an irresponsible Cuban Government would tolerate acts of aggression to the glorious land of Washington and Lincoln .
