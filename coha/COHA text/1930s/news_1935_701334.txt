txt I Nearly 2,000,000 men , women and children fled from the heat of the I city yesterday in search of cooling breezes at beaches and resorts . A bright , sunny sky and a mild southerly breeze gave them all the pleas , ures and all the tribulations common to a Sunday in midsummer . Coney Island reported the largest crowd ever to visit that resort , and other beaches and resorts estimated crowds that were only slightly below previous records , Twelve persons lost their lives by drowning . Six of the victims were men and boys , and of the - others three were girls from 12 to 14 years old . The rush from the city started early and continued throughout the day . Motorists who arrived at the beaches as late as 9 A. M. found it almost impossible to find a place to park . Some of them ran their cars over sidewalks and left them in vacant lots . Traffic was heavy on all the highways leading out of the city , and jams were frequent at the approaches to bridges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parkways of Long Island , Westchester and New Jersey were crowded all day by motorists going and returning on longer trips to suburban areas . A large proportion of the visitors went to their destinations by subway , bus , trolley and train . Subway trains seemed to move almost in one continuous line . Almost all of the railroads ran excursions to seat shore points . The driveways of bus stations were jammed continuously by seashore travelers . All seemed anxious to bid good-bye to the city , even if only for the day . Those obliged to remain in town encountered temperatures that rose to a high of 89 at 12.40 P. M. from a low of 69 at 7 A. M. The high for the day was within two degrees of the record set in ? 1880 for July 14 . The average temperature was 79 , five degrees above normal , and continued a heat wave that has held the average temperature about five degrees above normal for the nine days since July 4 . The record low I for the date was 58 in 1926 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Mullins , 67 years old , a storekeeper of 100 West Fourth Street , Bayonne , N. J. , died after collapsing from the heat . John Hickson , 59 , of 170 Claremont Avenue , fell to the sidewalk in front of 253 West Sixty-ninth Street at noon , but was allowed to go home after he had been treated for . heat prostration . At Coney Island Coast Guardsmen patrolling the waters offshore remarked that the shore line appeared to have changed from a beach of sand to a beach of humanity . There was hardly a spot along the three miles of beach that was not occupied by some one lying in the sun , eating lunch or minding the children . Two hundred children strayed out of sight of their parents and were held to be called for at the police station and at four booths beneath the Boardwalk in which policewomen were stationed . Continuing a campaign against the peddlers of sloppy drinks and gluey candies , patrolmen arrested 130 vendors on the beaches and streets of the resort . The cells at the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners arrested later in the day were taken to other stations throughout Brooklyn . Lifeguards assisted many persons back to shore from deep water , but no one seemed to have been in seAims difficulties . During a day in which nearly 1,000,000 persons actually went in bathing there was only one case of treatment for submersion . Miss Jean Martignetti , 20 , of 1,113 Sixty-sixth Street , Brooklyn , went out beyond her depth at the foot of West Twentythird Street . She was brought back to shore by a lifeguard and taken to Coney Island Hospital for treatment . 323 Rescues at Rockaways . A heavy surf off the Rockaways created conditions that took many bathers by surprise . Throughout the day lifeguards rescued 323 persons . Most of them had been caught in deep water with the rising of the tide in the afternoon . One lifeguard , Boris Karogonzian , rescued thirty-two persons from deep water off Beach Eighty-fourth Street . Five first-aid stations maintained at the beach by the Borough of Queens gave treatments to 634 persons , mostly for cut feet , turned ankles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take action on the problem of women walking in shorts on the Boardwalk and business streets of the beach communities . Last year the civic bodies withheld action in the belief that the wearing of shorts was a passing fad . But early this season many women appeared on the streets in costumes that seemed hardly as ample as a 1935 bathing suit . The Chamber of Commerce protested that while abbreviated attire might be suitable for the beach , it was hardly proper on the main streets of communities . Frederick S. Marsell , president of the chamber , announced yesterday that a canvass of civic organizations indicated that they all held similar views . He said the chamber planned to open a campaign to tighten a city ordinance against wearing bathing suits in the streets , to include the wearing of shorts . The Rockaway Chamber appealed to organizations in Coney Island for support , but learned that Coney Island residents appeared to be taking a more liberal view toward the wearing of shorts . Meanwhile , the chamber has asked the Board of Aldermen of Yonkers for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prohibit the wearing of shorts by hikers passing through that city .
