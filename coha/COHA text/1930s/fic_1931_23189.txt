FOX HUNT A STORY BY WILLIAM FAULKNER N N HOUR before daylight three negro stable-boys approached the stable , carrying a lantern . While one of them unlocked and slid back the door , the bearer of the lantern lifted it and turned the beam into the darkness where a clump of pines shouldered into the paddock fence . Out of this darkness three sets of big , spaced eyes glared mildly for a moment , then vanished . " Heyo , " the negro called . " Yawl coIe ? " No reply , no sound came from the darkness ; the mule-eyes did not show again . The negroes entered the barn , murmuring among themselves ; a burst of laughter floated back out of the stable , mellow and meaningless and idiotic . " How many of um you see ? " the second negro said . " Just three mules , " the lantern-bearer said . " It 's more than that , though . Unc Mose he come in about two o'clock , where he been up with that Jup'ter horse ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clay-eaters . Hoo . " Inside the stalls horses began to whinny and stamp ; over the whitewashed doors the high , long muzzles moved with tossing , eager shadows ; the atmosphere was rich , warm , ammoniac , and clean . The negroes began to put feed into the patent troughs , moving from stall to stall with the clever agility of monkeys , with short , mellow , meaningless cries , " Hoo . Stand over dar . Ghy ketch dat fox to-day . " In the darkness where the clump of pines shouldered the paddock fence , eleven men squatted , surrounded by eleven tethered mules . It was November , and the morning was chill , and the men squatted shapeless and motionless , not talking . From the stable came the sound of the eating horses ; just before day broke a twelfth man came up on a mule and dismounted and squatted among the others without a word . When day came and the first saddled horse was led out of the stable , the grass was rimed with frost , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . It could be seen then that the squatting men were all white men and all in overalls , and that all of the mules save two were saddleless . They had gathered from one-room , clay-floored cabins about the pine land , and they squatted , decorous , grave , and patient among their gaunt and mud-caked and burr-starred mules , watching the saddled horses , the fine horses with pedigrees longer than Harrison Blair 's , who owned them , being led one by one from a steam-heated stable and up the gravel path to the house , before which a pack of hounds already moiled and yapped , and on the veranda of which men and women in boots and red coats were beginning to gather . Slovenly , unhurried , outwardly scarcely attentive , the men in overalls watched Harrison Blair , who owned the house and the dogs and some of the guests too , perhaps , mount a big , vicious-looking black horse , and they watched another man lift Harrison flair 's wife onto a chestnut mare and then mount a bay horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chewing tobacco slowly . Beside him stood a youth , in overalls too , gangling , with a soft stubble of beard . They spoke without moving their heads , hardly moving their lips . " That the one ? " the youth said . The older man spat deliberately , without moving . " The one what ? " " His wife 's one . " " Whose wife 's one ? " " Blair 's wife 's one . " The other contemplated the group before the house . He appeared to , that is . His gaze was inscrutable , blank , without haste ; none could have said if he were watching the man and woman or not . " Do n't believe anything you hear , and not more than half you see , " he said . " What do you think about it ? " the youth said . The other spat deliberately and carefully . " Nothing , " he said . " It ai n't none of my wife . " Then he said , without raising his voice and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the head groom who had come up beside him . " That fellow do n't own no horse . " " Which fellow do n't ? " the groom said . The white man indicated the man who was holding the bay horse against the chestnut mare 's flank . " Oh , " the groom said . " Mr. Gawtrey . Pity the horse , if he did . " " Pity the horse that he owns , too , " the white man said . " Pity anything he owns . " " You mean Mr. Harrison ? " the groom said . " Does these here horses look like they needs your pity ? " " Sho , " the white man said . " That 's right . I reckon that black horse does like to be rode like he rides it . " " Do n't you be pitying no Blair horses , " the groom said . " Sho , " the white man said . He appeared to contemplate the blooded horses that lived in a steam-heated house , the people in boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black . " He 's been trying to catch that vixen for three years now , " he said . " Why n't he let one of you boys shoot it or pizen it ? " " Shoot it or pizen it ? " the groom said . " Do n't you know that ai n't no way to catch a fox ? " " Why ai n't it ? " " It ai n't spo'tin , " the groom said . " You ought to been hanging around urn long enough by now to know how plum-nuns hunts . " " Sho , " the white man said . He was not looking at the groom . " Wonder how a man rich as folks says he is " ? again he spat , in the action something meager but without intended insult , as if he might have been indicating Blair with a jerked finger ? " is got time to hate one little old fox bitch like that . Do n't even want the dogs to catch it . Trying to outride the dogs so he can kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming all the way down here ever year , bringing all them folks and boarding and sleeping them , to run one little old mangy fox that I could catch in one night with a axe and a possum dog . " " That 's something else about gempmuns you wo n't never know , " the groom said . " Sho , " the white man said . The ridge was a long shoal of pine and sand , broken along one flank into gaps through which could be seen a fallow rice field almost a mile wide the youth said , " That one do n't seem to need no dogs neither . " His head was still turned after the vanished riders . The other man said nothing . " Yes , sir , " the youth said . " Just like a fox . I be durn if I see how that skinny neck of hero ... Like you look at a fox and you wonder how a durn little critter like it can tote all that brush . And once I heard him say " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spitting , that it was the rider of the black horse and not the bay , of whom he spoke ? " something to her that a man do n't say to a woman in comp'ny , and her eyes turned red like a fox 's and then brown again like a fox . " The other did not answer . The youth looked at him . The older man was leaning a little forward on his mule , looking down into the field . " What 's that down there ? " he said . The youth looked also . From the edge of the woods beneath them came a mold-muffied rush of hooves and then a crash of undergrowth ; then they saw , emerging from the woods at full gallop , Blair on the black horse . He entered the rice field at a dead run and began to cross it with the unfaltering and undeviating speed of a crow 's flight , following a course as straight as a surveyor 's line toward the dyke which bounded the field at its other side . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That fox is hid yonder on that ditch-bank . Well , it ai n't the first time they ever seen one another eye to eye . He got close enough to it once two years ago to throw that ere leather riding-switch at it . " " Sho , " the youth said . " These folks do n't need no dogs . " In the faint , sandy road which followed the crest of the ridge , and opposite another gap in the trees through which could be seen a pie-shaped segment of the rice field , and some dis-tance in the rear of the hunt , stood a Ford car with a light truck body . Beneath the wheel sat a uniformed chauffeur ; beside him , hunched into a black overcoat , was a man in a derby hat . He had a smooth , flaccid , indoors face and he was smoking a cigarette : a face sardonic and composed , yet at the moment a little wearily savage , like that of an indoors-bred and - inclined man subject to and helpless before some natural inclemency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure . This all belongs to ' her , house and all . His old man owned it before they moved to New York and got rich , and Blair was born here . He bought it back and give it to her for a wedding present . All he kept was this what-ever-it-is he 's trying to catch . " " And he ca n't catch that , " the chauffeur said . " Sure . Coming down here every year and staying two months , without nothing to see and nowheres to go except these clay-eaters and nigras . If he wants to live in a herd of nigras for two months every year , why do n't he go and spend a while on Lenox Avenue ? You do n't have to drink the gin . But he 's got to buy this place and give it to her for a present because she is one of these Southern and she might get homesick or something . Well , that 's all right , I guess . But Fourteenth Street is far enough south for me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Europe or somewheres . I do n't know which is worse . " " Why did he marry her , anyways ? " the chauffeur said . " You want to know why he married her ? It was n't the jack , even if they did have a pot full of it , of this Oklahoma Indian oil . . . " " Indian oil ? " " Sure . The government give this Oklahoma to the Indians because nobody else would n't have it , and when the first Indian got there and seen it and dropped dead and they tried to bury him , when they stuck the shovel into the ground the oil blowed the shovel out of the fellow 's hand , and so the white folks come . They would come up with a new Ford with a man from the garage driving it and they would go to an Indian and say , ' Well , John , how much rotten-water you catchum your front yard ? ' and the Indian would say three wells or thirteen wells or whatever it is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . The way the White Father put the bee on you boys , it 's too had . Well , never mind . You see this fine new car here ? Well , I 'm going to give it to you so you can load up your folks and go on to where the water do n't come out of the ground rotten and where the White Father ca n't put the bee on you no more . ' So the Indian would load his family into the car , and the garage man would head the car west , I guess , and show the Indian where the gasoline lever was and hop off and snag the first car hack to town . See ? " " Oh , " the chauffeur said . " Sure . So here we was in England one time , minding our own business , when here this old dame and her redheaded gal come piling over from Europe or sornewheres where the gal was going to the high school , and here it ai n't a week before Blair says , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What the hell do you think of that ? ' And him a fellow that had n't done nothing all his life but dodge skirts so he could drink all night and try to ride a horse to death all day , getting married in less than a week . But soon as I see this old dame , I know which one of her and her husband it was that had took them oil wells off the Indians . " " She must have been good , to put it on Blair at all , let alone that quick , " the chauffeur said . " Tough on her , though . I 'd hate for my daughter to belong to him . Not saying nothing against him , of course . " " I 'd hate for my dog to belong to him . I see him kill a dog once because it would n't mind him . Killed it with a walking stick , with one lick . He says , Here . Send Andrews here to haul this away . ' " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauffeur said . " Driving his cars , that 's one thing . But you , in the house with him day and night . . " " We settled that . He used to ride me when he was drinking . One day he put his hand on me and I told him I would kill him . ' When ? ' he says . When you get back from the hospital ? ' Maybe before I go there , ' I says . I had my hand in my pocket . ' I believe you would , ' he says . So we get along now . I put the rod away and he do n't ride me any more and we get along . " " Why did n't you quit ? " " I do n't know . It 's a good job , even if we do stay all over the place all the time . Jees ! half the time I do n't know if the next train goes to Ty Juana or Italy ; I do n't know half the time where I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even . And I like him and he likes me . " " Maybe he quit riding you because he had something else to ride , " the chauffeur said . " Maybe so . Anyways , when they married , she had n't never been on a horse before in all her life until he bought this chestnut horse for her to match her hair . We went all the way to Kentucky for it , and he come back in the same car with it . I would n't do it ; I says I would do anything in reason for him but I was n't going to ride in no horse pullman with it empty , let alone with a horse already in it . So I come back in a lower . " He did n't tell her about the horse until it was in the stable . ' But I do n't want to ride , ' she says . " ' My wife will be expected to ride , ' he says . ' You are not in Oklahoma now . ' " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can at least sit on top of the horse so they will think you can ride on it , ' he says . " So she goes to Callaghan , riding them practice plugs of his with the children and the chorines that have took up horse riding to get ready to get drafted from the bushes out in Brooklyn or New Jersey to the Drive or Central Park . And her hating a horse like it was a snake ever since one day when she was a kid and gets sick on a merry-go-round . " " How did you know all this ? " the chauffeur said . " I was there . We used to stop there now and then in the afternoon to see how she was coming on the horse . Sometimes she would n't even know we was there , or maybe she did . Any-ways , here she would go , round and round among the children and one or two head of Zigfield 's prize stock , passing us and not looking at us , and Blair standing there with that black I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew all the time she could n't ride no horse even on a merry-go-round and like he did n't care if she learned or not , just so he could watch her trying and not doing it . So at last even Callaghan come to him and told him it was n't no use . ' Very well , ' Blair says . Callaghan says you may be able to sit on the top of a painted horse , so I will buy you a horse out of a dump cart and nail him to the front porch , and you can at least he sitting on top of it when we come up . ' go back to momma 's , ' she says . " ' I wish you would , ' Blair says . My old man tried all his life to make a banker out of me , but your old woman done it in two months . " ' " I thought you said they had jack of their own , " the chauffeur said . " Why did n't she spend some of that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no exchange for Indian money in New York . Anyways , you would have thought she was a conductor on a Broadway surface car . Sometimes she would n't even wait until I could get Blair under a shower and a jolt into him before breakfast , to make the touch . So the gal goes to the old dame ( she lives on Park Avenue ) and the gal . " " Was you there too ? " the chauffeur said . " Cried . . . What ? Oh . This was a maid , a little Irish kid named Burke ; me and her used to go out now and then , She was the one told me about this fellow , this Yale college boy , this Indian sweetheart . " " Indian sweetheart ? " " They went to the same ward school out at Oklahoma or something . Swapped Masonic rings or something before the gal 's old man found three oil wells in the henhouse and dropped dead and the old dame took the gal off to Europe to go to the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year what does he do but marry a gal out of a tank show that happened to he in town . Well , when she finds that Callaghan has give her up , she goes to her old woman in Park Avenue . She cries . ' I begin to think that maybe I wo n't look funny to his friends , and then he comes there and watches me . He do n't say nothing , ' she says , ' he just stands there and watches me . ' " ' After all I 've done for you , ' the old dame says . Got you a husband that any gal in New York would have snapped up . When all he asks is that you learn to sit on top of a horse and not shame him before his swell friends . After all I done for you , ' the old dame says . " ' I did n't , ' she says , ' I did n't want to marry him . ' " ' Who did you want to marry ? ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry nobody , ' the gal says . " So now the old dame digs up about this boy , this Allen boy that the gal . . . " " I thought you said his name was Yale , " the chauffeur said . " No . Allen . Yale is where he went to this college . " " You mean Columbia . " " No . Yale . It 's another college . " " I thought the other one was named Cornell or something , " the chauffeur said . " No . It 's another one . Where these college boys all come from when these hotchachaelia deadfalls get raided and they give them all a ride downtown in the wagon . Do n't you read no papers ? " " Not often , " the chauffeur said . " I do n't care nothing about politics . " " All right . So Yale boy 's poppa had found a oil well too and he was lousy with it too , and besides the old dame was mad because Blair would n't leave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nowheres when we went . So the old dame give them all three  --  her and Blair and this college boy  --  the devil until the gal jumps up and says she will ride on a horse or bust , and Blair told her to go on and bust if she aimed to ride on this chestnut horse we brought all the way back from Kentucky . ' I do n't aim for you to ruin this good horse , ' Blair says . ' You 'll ride on the horse I tell you to ride on . ' " So then she would slip out the back way and go off and try to ride this horse , this good one , this Kentucky plug , to learn how first and then surprise him . The first time did n't hurt her , but the second time it broke her collar bone , and she was scared how Blair would find it out until she found out how he had knew it all the time that she was riding on it . So when we come down here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyron or whatever it ? " " Fox , " the chauffeur said . " All right . That 's what I said . So when ? " " You said lyron , " the chauffeur said . " All right . Leave it be a lyron . Anyways , she would ride on this chestnut horse , trying to keep up , and Blair already outrun the dogs and all , like this time two years ago when he run off from the dogs and got close enough to this lyron to hit it with his riding whip ? " " You mean fox , " the chauffeur said . " A fox , not a lyron . Say . . . " The other man , the valet , secretary , whatever he might have been , was lighting another cigarette , crouched into his upturned collar , the derby slanted down upon his face . " Say what ? " he said . " I was wondering , " the chauffeur said . " Wondering what ? " " If it 's as hard for him to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To not see her ruining this good Kentucky horse . If he has to ride as fast to do it as he thinks he does . " " What about that ? " " Maybe lie do n't have to ride as fast this year as he did last year , to run off from her . What do you think about it ? " " Think about what ? " " I was wondering . " " What wondering ? " " If he knowed he do n't have to ride as fast this year or not . " " Oh . You mean Gawtrey . " " That his name ? Gawtrey ? " " That 's it . Steve Gawtrey . " " What about him ? " " He 's all right . He 'll eat your grub and drink your liquor and fool your women and let you say when . " " Well , what about that ? " " Nothing . I said he was all right . He 's fine by me . " FOX " How by you ? " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , and he done me a little favor , see ? " " Oh , " the chauffeur said . He did not look at the other . " How long has she known him ? " " Six months and maybe a week . We was up in Connecticut and he was there . He hates a horse about as much as she does , but me and Callaghan are all right too ; I done Callaghan a little favor once too , so about a week after we come back from Connecticut , I have Callaghan come in and tell Blair about this other swell dog , without telling Blair who owned it . So that night I says to Blair , ' I hear Mr. Van Dyming wants to buy this horse from Mr. Gawtrey too . ' Buy what horse ? ' Blair says . ' I do n't know , ' I says . ' One horse looks just like another to me as long as it stays out doors where it belongs , ' I says . ' So do they to Gawtrey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? ' ' This horse Callaghan was telling you about , ' I says . Then he begun to curse Callaghan . ' He told me he would get that horse for me , ' he says . ' It do n't belong to Callaghan , ' I says , it 's Mr. Gawtrey 's horse . ' So here it 's two nights later when he brings Gawtrey home to dinner with him . That night I says , ' I guess you bought that horse . ' He had been drinking and he cursed Gawtrey and Callaghan too . ' He wo n't sell it , ' he says . ' You want to keep after him , ' I says . A. man will sell anything . ' ' How keep after him , when he wo n't listen to a price ? ' he says . ' Leave your wife do the talking , ' I says . ' He 'll listen to her . ' That was when he hit me . . . " " I thought you said he just put his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean he just kind of flung out his hand when he was talking , and I happened to kind of turn my face toward him at the same time . He never aimed to hit me because he knowed I would have took him . I told him so . I had the rod in my hand , inside my coat , all the while . " So after that Gawtrey would come back maybe once a week because I told him I had a good job and I did n't aim to have to shoot myself out of it for no man except myself maybe . He come once a week . The first time she would n't leave him in . Then one day I am reading the paper ( you ought to read a paper now and then . You ought to keep up with the day of the week , at least ) and I read where this Yale Allen boy has run off with a show gal and they had fired him off the college for losing his amateur 's standing , I guess . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped the college anyways . So I cut it out , and this Burke kid ( me and her was all right , too ) she puts it on the breakfast tray that A.M. And that afternoon , when Gawtrey happens to come back , she leaves him in , and this Burke kid happens to walk into the room sudden with something  --  I do n't know what it was ? and here is Gawtrey and her like a fade-out in the pitchers . " " So Blair got his horse , " the chauffeur said . " What horse ? " " The horse Gawtrey would n't sell him . " " How could he , when Gawtrey never owned no horse no more than I do , unless it 's maybe some dog still finishing last year 's Selling Plate at Pimlico ? Besides , Gawtrey do n't owe Blair no horse yet . " " Not yet ? " " She do n't like him , see . The first time he come to the house alone she would n't leave him into the front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid had n't happened to left that piece out of the papers about this college boy on the breakfast tray . And the time after that when he come , she would n't leave him in again ; it was like he might have been a horse maybe , or even a dog , because she hated a dog worse than she did a horse even , even if she did n't have to try to ride on no dog . If it had have been a dog , Blair would n't have never got her to even try to ride on it . So I 'd have to go out and steam Callaghan up again until it got to where I was n't no more than one of these Russian droshkies or something . " " A Russian what ? " " One of these fellows that ca n't call their own soul . Every time I would leave the house I would have to meet Gawtrey in a dump somewheres and then go to see Callaghan and soap him down , because he is one of these boys with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Just ideas . Out of the Sunday School paper . About how this was n't right because he liked her and felt sorry for her and so he wanted to tell Blair he had been lying and that Gawtrey had n't never owned no horse . Because a fellow that wo n't take a nickel when it 's throwed right in his face , he ai n't never as big a fool to nobody as he is to the man that can have some sense about religion and keep all these golden rules in the Sunday School paper where they come from . If the Lord did n't want a man to cut his own grass , why did He put Sunday on Sunday like he did ? Tell me that . " " I guess you 're right , " the chauffeur said . " Sure I 'm right . Jees ! I told Callaghan Blair would cut his throat and mine both for a Rockefeller quarter , same as any sensible man , and I ast him if he thought gals had done all give out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the last one they made . " " So he do n't .. . " the chauffeur said . He ceased ; then he said , " Look there . " The other man looked . Through the gap in the trees , in the center of the segment of visible rice field , they could see a tiny pink-and-black dot . It was almost a mile away , and so it did not appear to be moving fast . " What 's that ? " the other said . " The fox ? " " It 's Blair , " the chauffeur said . " He 's going fast . I wonder where the others are . " They watched the pinkand-black dot go on and disappear . " They 've went back home if they bad any sense , " the other said . " So we might as well go back too . " " I guess so , " the chauffeur said . " So Gawtrey do n't owe Blair no horse yet . " " Not yet . She do n't like him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and this Burke kid says she come back from a party one night because Gawtrey was there . And if it had n't been for me , Gawtrey would n't a got invited down here , because she told Blair that if he come , she would n't come . So I 'd have to work on Callaghan again so he would come in once a day and steam Blair up again about the horse to get Gawtrey invited , because Blair was going to make her come . " The chauffeur got out of the car and went around to the crank . The other man lighted a cigarette . " But Blair ai n't got his horse yet . You take a woman with long hair like she 's got , long as she keeps her hair up , it 's all right . But once you catch her with her hair down , it 's just been too bad . " The chauffeur engaged the crank . Then he paused , stooped , his head turned . " Listen , " he said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came again , faint , distant , prolonged . " What 's that ? " the other said . " Do they have to keep soldiers here ? " " It 's the horn they blow , " the chauffeur said . " It means they have caught that fox . " " fees ! " the other said . " Maybe we will go back to town to-morrow . " The two men on the mules recrossed the rice field and mounted the ridge into the pines . " Well , " the youth said , " I reckon he 's satisfied now . " " You reckon he is ? " the other said . He rode a little in front of the youth . He did not turn his head when he spoke . " He 's run that fox three years , " the youth said . " And now he 's killed it . How come he ai n't satisfied ? " The older man did not look back . He slouched on his gaunt , shabby mule , his overalled legs dangling . He spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon that 's something about gentle-men you wo n't never know . " " Fox is fox , to me , " the youth said . " Ca n't eat it . Might as well pizen it and save them horses . " " Sho , " the other said . " That 's something else about them you wo n't never know . " " About who ? " " Gentle-men . " They mounted the ridge and turned into the faint , sandy road . " Well , " the older man said , " gentleman or not , I reckon that 's the only fox in Cal-lina that ever got itself killed that-a-way . Maybe that 's the way they kills a fox up north . " " Then I he darn if I ai n't glad I do n't live up there , " the youth said . " I reckon so , " the other said . " I done got along pretty well here for some time , myself . " " I 'd like to see it once though , " the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the other said , " if living there makes a man go to all this trouble to kill a fox . " They were riding up the ridge , among the pines , the holly bushes , the huckleberries and briers . Suddenly the older man checked his mule , extending his hand backward . " What ? " the youth said . " What is it ? " The pause was hardly a pause ; again the older man rode on , though he began to whistle , the tone carrying and clear though not loud , the tune lugubrious and hymnlike ; from beyond the bushes which bordered the path just ahead of them there came the snort of a horse . " Who is it ? " the youth said . The other said nothing . The two mules went on in single file . Then the youth said quietly , " She 's got her hair down . It looks like the sun on a spring branch . " The mules paced on in the light , whispering soil , their ears bobbing , the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman sat the mare , her hair a bright cloud , a copper cascade in the sun , about her shoulders , her arms lifted and her hands busy in it . The man sat the bay horse a short distance away . He was lighting a cigarette . The two mules came up , tireless , shambling , with drooping heads and nodding ears . The youth looked at the woman with a stare at once bold and covert ; the older man did not cease his mellow , slow , tuneless whistling ; he did not appear to look at them at all . He appeared to be about to ride past without a sign when the man on the bay spoke to him . " They caught it , did they ? " he said . " We heard the born . " " Yaas , " the man in overalls said , in a dry , drawling tone . " Yaws . It got caught . ' Twarnt nothing else it could do but get caught .

" You mean , there were no dogs there ? " " I reckon not , " the other said . " Them dogs never had no black horses to ride . " The two mules had halted ; the older man faced the man on the bay a little , his face hidden beneath his shapeless hat . " It crossed the old field and dropped over that ditch-bank and hid , allowing for him to jump the ditch , and then it aimed to double back , I reckon . I reckon it was n't scared of the dogs .

I reckon maybe yawl seen him , riding straight across that field like he could see like a hawk and smell like a dog . And the fox was there , where it had done fooled the dogs . But it never had no spell to breathe in , and when it had to run again and dropped over the ditch-bank , it dropped into the briers , I reckon , and it was too tired to get out and run . And he come up and jumped that ditch , just like that fox aimed for him to . Only the fox was still in the briers , and while he was going through the air he looked down and seen the fox and he dumb off the horse while it was jumping and dropped feet first into the briers like the fox done . Maybe it dodged some then ; I do n't know . He says it just swirled and jumped at his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead with his boot-heels . The dogs had n't got there then . But it so happened he never needed them . " He ceased talking and sat for a moment longer , sloven and inert upon the shabby , patient mule , his face shadowed beneath his hat . " Well , " he said , " I reckon I 'll get on . I ai n't had ne'er a bite of breakfast yet . I 'll bid yawl good morning . " He put his mule into motion , the second mule following . He did not look back . But the youth did . He looked back at the man on the bay horse , the cigarette burning in his hand , the plume of smoke faint and windless in the sunny silence , and at the woman on the chestnut , her arms lifted and her hands busy in her bright , cloudy hair ; projecting , trying to project , himself , after the way of the young , toward that remote and inaccessible she , trying to encompass the vain and inarticulate instant of division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage : rage at the lost woman , despair of the man in whose shape there walked the tragic and inescapable earth her ruin . " She was crying , " he said , then he began to curse , savagely , without point or subject . " Come on , " the older man said . He did not look back . " I reckon them hunt breakfast hoe-cakes will be about ready time we get home . "
