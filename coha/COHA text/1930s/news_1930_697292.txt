' Bobby Jones had come home before with honors from abroad but yesterday he came not only as the winner of the British open golf championship but as the British amateur . champion as ' Well . He is the second native American to hold the latter title and the first to hold both . He ' returned aboard the Europa with his , wife , Mrs. Mary Jones , to be greeted affectionately when he stepped aboard the city 's welcoming tug Macom , by his mother and father , Mr. and Mrs. Robert T.

Probably many in the sidewalk crowds could not have told a putter from a brassie , but they all knew that Jones had brought new athletic laurels to America and all wanted to do him honor . A large delegation of fellow-citizens from Atlanta joined New Yorkers in greeting the 1 home town boy and managed to inject an atmosphere of informality into the big city 's welcome ritual . Mayor Walker seemed to sense It as the motorcade emerged from the ticker-tape blizzard on Broadway and swung into City Hall Plaza headed by the Sanitation Department band and an escort of mounted policemen . The Mayor , who had been standing on the steps surrounded by his staff , saw the golf champion in the first car and sprinted down to clap him on the back and shake his hand before Mr. Johnson had time to present his distinguished guest .

" Here you are , the greatest golfer in the world , being introduced by the worst one , " he said , and the crowd of Georgians laughed and shouted : " Attaboy , Jimmy . " The titles Jones had won had been won before and would be won again , Mayor Walker continued , but he said they " never will be won by a finer gentleman or a better sportsman . " " Bobby , " continued the Mayor , " your modesty makes it difficult to say those , things which we would like to say about you without making you feel uncomfortable .

" The victories Jones won in England , Mayor Walker said , probably would increase the demand fur municipal golf courses so that our youngsters will have a chance to grow up and be champions . That would be all right too , the Mayor said , if one of them turned out to be " a Bobby Jones . " In replying , Jones said : " I am overcome by the kind things you have said and the tremendous welcome accorded me . I have not experienced anything like this before . When I came up Broadway I tried ? to figure out the reason for it . Ordinarily when I intend to speak I make up my speech as the other fellow goes along , but I was cut off my game this time .

" The party then stepped into waiting automobiles and drove to the Hotel Vanderbilt , where a dinner was given in honor of the champion , who leaves this morning for Minneapolis , where he has entered in the American open championship play . New York has seen three city receptions in as many weeks and apparently the thrill of tossing streamers of ticker tape from windows is waning . Or perhaps it was because the Fourth of July is so near . At any rate firecrackers popped above the heads of the sidewalk crowds and once a whole package of them , tossed from a window , exploded with the rat-a-tat-tat of a machine gun .

When Bobby Jones , his wife anti the party of ten that was with him came aboard the Macom , ' a Mr. Prendergast , who acted as aide for Mr. Johnson , conceived the idea of holding the interview upon the deck instead of in the cabin , where it usually is held . The result was that little of what Jones had to say was heard above the din of whistling harbor craft and the Macom 's own siren . The golfer managed to shout that he felt fine , had not decided to retire and had not left his golf bags behind in England , as was reported .
