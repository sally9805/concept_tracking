IF you should mention the name " Johnny Appleseed " to any farmer in Ross County , Ohio , he would look at you quizzically , wondering how much you know , and then he would withdraw silently into his own memories and reflections . Just what those reflections are , and whether they have resulted in any decisions , I do n't know , but I suspect they are very important indeed , simply because they may suggest the future of American agriculture and democracy . The familiar response to the name would be there of course . Most of us know better than any schoolchild the story of the gaunt , bearded , long-haired man who wandered alone through the Middle West during its settlement , carrying a Bible , a staff , and a sack , dressed in burlap , with a rope round his waist and his cook-pan for a hat . We know that he befriended both the white people and the Indians , preached the Gospel , and set out and cared for the first nurseries and apple orchards in that savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who did all that , and that his name was Jonathan Chapman , but the facts are less important to us than the legend . I know I am not alone here in liking Johnny Apple-seed because he represents the America that has never been interested in money or public opinion , that has been friendly , sensible , and brave instead of aggressive and bloody , that has nurtured life instead of destroying it , and that has been sensitive to the beauty of this continent , and done something to create here a civilization . Johnny Appleseed stands for ourselves at our best , and that 's why we all felt so keenly what happened . The question of our being represented at all first came up at one of the monthly meetings , at our co-operative grain elevator , of the board of directors of the Ross County Farm Bureau . There is a complicated network of farm organizations , enterprises , and government services ; but the sad fact is that , even taken all together , they are not actually representative . Yet it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the approach was made to the directors of the Farm Bureau , and that we co-operated on equal terms with the Grange in acting for the farmers of the county as such . I served on the Farm Bureau board for a year . Significantly and hopefully , felt , many of us who served that year , including myself , were not re-elected . I should like to describe those meetings but will content myself with saying that in my opinion we talked too much and did too little . I can say this because no member was longer on talk and shorter on action than myself . ( I am too much a writer and too little a farmer to have been on that board at all . ) We were usually very tired , we did n't listen enough to the women , we were unused to collective action , and we were rightly very tender toward minority opinion , very unwilling to boss or be bossed . All of this came out very clearly in the tragicomedy of Johnny Appleseed . At the meeting of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Sesquicentennial Celebration . The Committee wants us to have a float in the parade . Now what do all you folks think about that ? " We stiffened a little in our seats . The celebration was obviously going to be a big thing , and as farmers we obviously had to be represented . All of us had had enough to do with floats to know that they are not produced by people sitting in their seats . During two hours of discussion we nerved ourselves to vote twenty-five dollars and a committee of three , to get together if possible with an equal fund and committee from the Grange and produce a float . I had talked too much , and found myself on the committee . Still I went home that night feeling less guilty about my dollar for attendance and twenty-five cents for mileage . The celebration was of the founding of the Northwest Territory . Chillicothe was an early capital of this territory and the first capital of the State of Ohio . Some of the ultimately most important political activity in American history hadtaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own . Memories of profitable fairs and celebrations elsewhere stirred in the minds of our merchants . Our slightly older rival town , Marietta , was making great preparations to celebrate , and the sly rascals had got the Postmaster-General to issue a special stamp showing the Territory with Marietta but not Chillicothe . Town organizations had appointed committees to organize the whole celebration . There were going to he a costume ball , an enormous pageant by schoolchildren , a great historical parade , and the next day after the parade an appropriate reception of the ox-drawn covered wagon that was coming all the way from Massachusetts via Marietta , darn them . There were to be street decorations , and each merchant was ransacking his attic and cellar to find old tools of his trade for display in his windows . The whole thing was being financed successfully , chiefly through the sale of " wooden nickels , " which all of us were sure would soon be worth fifty dollars apiece , especially those with " sesquicentennial " spelled wrong . Congenitally , or perhaps because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes , we are not apt to act hastily or vigorously about anything ; but after several weeks the whole county , with all its remote towns , hamlets , and crossroads , became aroused . We had not approached a community of interest and action like this since the War . One rainy Saturday afternoon in April , while our wives were up on Paint Street , shopping , the six members of our joint farm committee on a float met in a smoky little office at the co-operative . With the exception of myself , they were probably as reliable and competent a committee as could have been named from all the men in the Farm Bureau and the Grange . No women had been appointed , ostensibly because the work would be fairly heavy and mechanical , and actually because we had decided that for once in our lives we were going to do something well without our women . My neighbor Mr. Oak , the master of the Grange , intelligent , reticent , and very tired , and Joe Copper , for the Farm Bureau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running for County Commissioner , were the joint chairmen . Actually , since Joe Copper was less busy than Mr. Oak , he undertook to run the show . First he tried to unload the ultimate responsibility on to me because I was supposed to be less busy than any of them , but I declined to accept it , quite definitely . Knowing that we should have to decide on the subject of our float , I had brought along an old Ohio history with a few paragraphs on Johnny Appleseed , illustrated with an imaginary sketch . To my surprise and pleasure , several of the others had thought of the same subject . Some thought it might be fun to play Indians in some historical episode , but it was reported that the Order of Red Men and several other organizations were going to provide swarms of these . After some discussion of Johnny Apple-seed , not by me , the feeling for him grew and he was unanimously selected to represent us . Then we talked about the possible ways of presenting our hero and agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which Johnny would ride . Each of us volunteered to do one or more special jobs of preparation , and Joe Copper correlated these quite expertly . He and Ed Raven , a lean , bright-eyed Granger who lived near him , were going to find a tree that could be spared , dig it up the week before the parade , and water it in the interval , so that it would have time to wilt and revive . They would also find a low wagon on which the big tree could be mounted , and transport both to the County Garage , where the work of assembling would be done . Harry Schermerhorn , a quiet , ingenious , and reliable little man , had some good ideas about decoration and would provide the materials and his own skill in working with them when the time came . He would be assisted in this difficult job by Mr. Oak . I said that I would get more information about Johnny Appleseed , weave a fence such as he used to protect his seedlings , and provide costume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to play the part of Johnny , but when declined firmly , Joe Copper said he had in mind an old man with a beard who lived out his way . We had a long discussion of Johnny 's age , and finally decided not to he too finicky about that . To our great delight , Elmer Graves , a powerful , good-natured fellow , said that he could get two yoke of oxen to pull the whole float when the great day arrived . We arranged to have another meeting soon and broke up cheerful and confident . By golly , it was n't only the business men who could do things in Ross County ! II In the following weeks we had several good meetings to report progress , check up on details , and integrate our efforts . Evidently everything was going very nicely . One afternoon I stopped at Joe Copper 's house and he drove me some miles to the place where he and Ed Raven and others had dug up a large old wild apple tree , complete with a huge bail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in odd moments I busied myself with cutting pliant willow wands and weaving a section of fence to be put on the back of the float . With the eager assistance of the Librarian of Cincinnati and a scholar at the State university , I managed to get together a few books over which the other committeemen pored with an interest that astonished me . Before we were through we were debating about historical details like a group of scholars , and I may say that these farmers showed more ability to find the wheat in the chaff than some Ph.D . ' s I have known . Like the other five , I was finding the job more difficult and interesting than I had expected that it would be . The parade was to take place on a Friday afternoon in May , and the morning before , the six of us assembled at the County Garage with most of the materials . Tree , wagon , lumber , and tools for a special bed , green and yellow cheese-cloth , sawdust to simulate earth , apple seedlings for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other little things were all soon assembled , and we set cheerfully to work . When I admired the tree , which was at least twelve feet tall and equally wide , with a good shape , and still green , Joe Copper reported nonchalantly that the first tree had withered a second time , and they had had to find and dig up another . It appeared that the old man with the beard had demanded five dollars for his services , and had been told what he could do with his beard . Then Joe had secured Mr. Amos Lockslcy , a good farmer and fine old Granger who , everyone assured me , would do very well . Soon Mr. Locksley appeared , and I saw at once that they were quite right . He was a tall , dignified , clean-shaven , very handsome old man with brown skin , white hair , and wonderful dark eyes . He was also very intelligent and willing , had read up on Johnny , and came supplied with costume and properties to supplement what I had gathered together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared , was the man who had a huge tract of woodland , full of wildflowers , and who every spring could and did open it to the public , to cut and dig and transplant as much as they chose . Except for Mr. Locksley 's very neat appearance , which he did n't mind altering , it was almost a case of type-casting . The weather was clear and warm , but there was a slaughter-house in the next lot , and I was pleased to note that I was n't the only sissy who found the odor extreme . No one did any bossing at all , and everyone consulted everyone else almost before driving each nail ; and yet for a significant wonder , the job went right along , and when in the late afternoon we had the tree mounted , theapples wired on , the nursery and fence arranged , and the float decorated with apples and practically finished , the whole thing had design and charm . With that beautiful tree , no advertising at all , and everything done with meticulous care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of our wives were working on a Garden Club float in a neighboring garage , and when they came over to fetch us home to our chores but first to inspect our work very critically , they had to admit that we had done a real job without any help from them . We attached a hose and watered the tree and seedlings for the last time that evening . Then the problem arose of how to protect the apples from theft by small boys that night . The County Garage , with road-scrapers and so on , is big , but our float was much bigger , and could n't possibly be put back in and locked up . We finally agreed to hire a watchman for the night , if we could , for two dollars and a half . City people on comfortable and regular salaries can not possibly appreciate the difficulty of that decision . We were all tired and had work to do at home , and yet to net two dollars and a half you have to produce and sell a surprising number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'd get my hired man for the job if I could , and that Mr. Locksley would guard the tree until he came . My wife , Peggy , and I hurried home , and I propositioned my Leo James , assuring him that if he sat up all night on this job he could have the next day off . He accepted gladly and hurried to town in my truck . Much later that night my wife and I and an old friend of ours named Helen Clive , who was visiting us , went to the costume ball and had a wonderful time . Helen made such an impression on all the local gentry that the first thing we knew we were mixed up with a lot of politicians , and the sheriff was telling me he wanted me to meet the Governor the next day . " You need n't be afraid of him , Allen , " he assured me ; " he 's just a farm boy like you and me . " I have been flattered in my time , but never more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a spot , because our Governor at that time . . . well , I would n't have touched him with a ten-foot pole . One reason I had such a good time that night was that as I caroused with my luckier town acquaintances , I could keep thinking : " There are n't any farmers here , for several reasons , good and bad , and you may think they are n't up to this celebration , and ca n't get together and do something . Ha , ha , ha ! " And while we were there . . The next morning James appeared as usual and reported that Mr. Locksley had not let him take over the job of watching the tree , because he , James , had had no proof that he had authority to do so . Thanks to my thoughtlessness , Mr. Locksley , who was not young , who had a cold , and who was about to take a long ride clad in almost nothing but a burlap sack , had sat up alone all night in his car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone else was there , already at work , and Mr. Locksley was fit and cheerful . We watered everything again , and made sure that every apple and every hit of decoration was secure . Then Mr. Locksley and I set to work on his costume and make-up , which included a long white beard to be put on almost hair by hair with gum arabic . I am far from an expert in these things , but I knew more than the others , and went ahead trusting to luck . While I worked on him we discussed his performance on the float , and agreed to make it very simple . I knew that we could trust that man 's instincts . When we were through I must say he looked right and quite worthy of the legend and the float . Even in that outrageous costume , with a tin pan squashed to fit his head , he had superlative dignity . I had supplied an old leather-bound book as a Bible for him to carry , but at his suggestion we substituted a less valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that looked quite as much like a Bible . Ido n't know why , but I was delighted when I noticed that Mr. Locksley 's book was a school edition of Virgil 's dEneid . It was getting on toward noon , l and feeling very happy about the whole thing , we began to drift home to dinner . The parade was to assemble uptown at 2:30 , and Elmer Graves said that the two yoke of oxen would appear by truck at 12:30 , or 12:45 at the latest , and he would show up at the same time . Joe Copper , the Chairman , said that he would wait around with Mr. Locksley until the oxen came . With much discussion everything had been arranged to yoke the oxen properly to the float and to take them by a good back route to their appointed place uptown . We were all very proud about those oxen . Most of the floats were going to be drawn by teams , and a few organizations were going to have one yoke of oxen . Well , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave . I wished Mr. Locksley luck , waved to Joe Copper , and hurried home to lunch . Still , somehow , at that moment , I did n't feel very good . I might stay and . . No , it was none of my damned business . It is in moments like that that men are made and broken and history is altered . III When I got home , Peggy told me that the sheriff had called up twice ? a disconcerting phrase to a farmer or a writer ? but only about the Governor . She had said quite truthfully that I was working on the Farm Bureau float and , rather less truthfully , that I could not be reached by telephone . Immediately after lunch we hurried into town ? that is , to the edge of town , where we had to leave our car . The three of us had been invited by our old friend Miss Mary Bell to see the parade from the front steps of her house , which is down near the center of town . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oxen , and people in costume , so that one got an impression that someone had been working on the place with a Wellsian time-machine , slightly out of order . Emerging from an alley , we would make our way through a nonchalant group of pioneers in buckskins and beards , with long rifles , or past an almost naked Indian in war paint and bonnet lighting the cigarette of a girl in crinolines . Ohio is where all the good bands come from : there must have been twenty different ones , in all kinds of costumes , tuning up on street corners . It was all so bizarre and exciting that I almost succeeded in forgetting that I had n't seen our great apple tree anywhere , and could n't remember the street corner where it certainly was waiting by this time . We found Miss Mary in holiday mood on her front steps , equipped with all kinds of robes and pillows . Hardly to our surprise , because , like everyone else , we were feeling very superior and smug about our celebration by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved along regularly , exactly as numbered and explained , with historical notes , in the program . Every single one of the forty or fifty floats was historical , and as near as any of us could tell , authentic , down to small details . Most of the properties were originals , not reproductions . Each float bore a simple placard but there was no advertising . There was almost no one in that parade without an historical costume , and there was not one single motor vehicle . Acting through nearly all of its too many organizations , with imagination , energy , and loving care , most of the people in the county had created a living record of our history from the prehistoric mound-builders to the Civil War and a little later . It was by all odds the most moving and interesting parade I have ever seen . An Armistice Day parade by the French Army and Navy , at the Arc de Triomphe ? and the French know how to put on a parade ? now took its place as a poor second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some kind , drawn by a handsome horse and driven by oneof our best farmers , costumed as General St. Clair , the first Governor of the Northwest Territory , who had been chased out of Chillicothe a century and a half before . He was now received with cheers . There were other great pioneers and territorial and State governors . Then there came another handsome horse , drawing an interesting old rig with a liveried groom up in the back . This was driven by one of our most powerful local political bosses , who calls himself a Democrat and is the attorney for our electric company . His passenger , according to the placard , which was hardly necessary considering the multitude of his photographs on posters and public works , was " The Present Governor of Ohio . " His Excellency kept bravely smiling and removing his hat to right and left , although he was recognized and his progress was accompanied with a unanimous and almost audible silence . We heard afterward that he cut several engagements and went right back to Columbus in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American politics could spoil that parade . There was every conceivable kind of a horse-drawn vehicle and several surprising early bicycles , all produced from old barns here and there . Four of our horsier and younger landowners , in costume , were driven by in a victoria . " That 's charming , " I thought , " but wait till you see what the real farmers have done . " There were accurate reproductions of an early schoolroom , with teacher and pupils , of an early printing and newspaper office in action , and of several early churches , one Negro , with an excellent choir . The Conservation League produced some early hunters with hounds baying at two live raccoons in a dead tree . One of the best exhibits was that of a small outlying community : they produced a whole company of pioneers moving west ? men , boys , and hounds walking ahead , a fine prairie schooner with women and children , a cow in tow , and even chickens , and another armed guard bringing up the rear . There were old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could appreciate ) , early firemen with equipment , and many notable old buildings now gone . There were mound-builders , hundreds of Indians , French-Canadian pricsts and voyageurs , all kinds of soldiers of the French and Indian Wars , the Revolution , and the War of 1812 . There was , in fact , every kind of a living and dramatic historical exhibit of that period and place that one could well imagine . As the parade went by , in perfcct order , with everyone clapping and cheering , and the bands blaring gaily along at regular intervals , I began to think that maybe our Johnny Appleseed would n't be so outstanding after all . But then I remembered that tree ? much bigger , finer , and fresher than anything of the kind that had come along , and Mr. Locksley , who somehow was more real than anyone we had seen yet . In the program , " Johnny Appleseed : Farm Bureau and Grange , " with historical note , was placed towards the end , say No. 33 . As the twenties went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't dare to run out to the curb to look down the street and see that great tree coming . " Almost now : that must be it ! " exclaimed Helen . I managed to look , and saw some little shrub in some other float . " No , not that , " I said . No. 31 , No. 32 . . . And then No. 34 , some damned thing or other , No. 35 , and No. 36 . " It must be later , certainly , " said Miss Mary . " Yes , they may have had to calm down the oxen or something , " said Helen . Peggy said nothing , and I did n't dare to look at her . And although I could now hardly see it , the parade went inexorably along , to the very end , which was marked by a couple of State troopers on motor cycles , followed by a crowd of small boys . Miss Mary was touching my arm and saying : " Come on inside , Allen . It 's grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sherry . " " Thank you , I think we do , " I said . We drank Miss Mary 's sherry and nibbled her biscuits almost in silence and hurried away . Miss Mary always understands things . It was raining now , and I ran almost all the way to get the car . On the way I passed some farm friends sitting rather pointlessly in their car . " Hey , Allen ! " " By God , do n't ask me ! " I yelled and ran on . I got the car , picked up the girls , and drove grimly , madly , to the County Garage . There was our float , exactly where it had been , dripping gently in the rain . Joe Copper was just standing there , looking at it and through it , with raindrops falling from his hat-brim . Without looking at me , he said : " The oxen never showed up . " I asked some rather violent questions and made some rather violent comments , and he just said it again : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still in costume , still with that tin pan on his head . He had pulled off his beard , but there were still tufts of it sticking to his face . He was up on the float , jerking the apples off the tree and throwing them to a gang of ragged children who had gathered there from nowhere . I went up to him but I could n't say a word . " These things happen , " he said . " These things happen and there is n't any use getting sore about them . " " Thank you , Mr. Locksley , " I said , and turned away . Helen , watching Mr. Locksley with the apples and the children , was weeping unashamed . I could n't have said whether Peggy was going to burst into tears or kick someone in the shins . Cars began to drive into the lot round the float . Some of the men jumped out , exploding as I had , but they fell silent quickly enough too , and then just stood there looking at that tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's get out of here , " I said , and we did . I am not really sure just what the three of us did that night . It may have been the night when we went to the big pageant , and I helped Peggy and her Girl Scouts hawk programs and W.P.A. Guides , and we all nearly froze . I do n't like pageants myself , but this was a good one . Or perhaps this was n't that night . Perhaps we just stayed at home and got quietly pickled . Or perhaps we did both . I do remember that we thought people would keep calling up , and that no one did . Of course not : there was n't anything to say . We did n't talk about it much ourselves . The unanswerable questions , the painful implications : there were more and more , the more we thought about it , and each seemed worse than the last . The next morning we got up horribly late and James and the girl were already at work . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agent , in the library with three professors of agriculture or something from the State university . I never did find out what that impressive call was all about . While I was shaking hands with them the ' phone rang and I dashed to it . It was Joe Copper , down at the County Garage . He said the Gazette had called up and wanted to know why we did n't get our float into the second parade , smaller and less important , that was going to greet the oxen and the covered wagon from Massachusetts via Marietta . They were going to arrive about noon . Joe wanted to know whether I thought that was a good idea , or maybe an anticlimax , and worse than not being in any parade . " Hell no , let 's get it in , " I said . I did n't even go back and apologize to Fred and the professors in the library . Fred always understands things too . I beat it out the back door and into the car . Peggy appeared and hopped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stag party either . When we got to the float we found that there were at least five other wives there working on it too . And there was n't anasty remark out of one of them . Elmer Graves was there too , this time working Iike mad , and so was his wife , and her face was wet . We did n't do any unnecessary talking : there was n't any time for that for one thing . We got some more bright red apples , and everyone wired them on that tree again , and into the festoons along the side . It was a big job , and all our fingers were n't working their best . We restored the nursery and gave the whole thing another good soaking with the hose . The leaves were still fresh . Someone called up a neighbor of mine who had a handsome team , and he was a good egg and took them right out of the harness when they were plowing . Mr. Lockslcy , quietly cheerful as ever , got into his burlap sack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had brought along the remnants of beard and make-up and went to work on him . I did n't have enough artificial hair left to make his own hair long in the back , but I made him a beard and he looked almost as good as he had the day before . We had arranged to hook the float on behind my truck and meet the team at an appointed place uptown . Peggy had got a big silver watch from someone and was standing over Joe Copper saying : " Only ten minutes left now , Mr. Copper , " and then : " Only five minutes now , Mr. Copper . " Everyone else heard her too , and as we were hooking up the float to the truck , the excitement , or the smell of the slaughter-house , or something , made me come near to emptying my stomach . I drove my truck , and everyone piled into cars and made a little parade behind the float . I drove as slowly as I could , I thought , with that truck , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Going over the railroad spur to the paper mill , I gave the whole thing such a shaking that most of the apples fell off . I stopped and got out and the street was full of our people who had climbed out of their cars and were picking up apples and wiring them on to that tree and float for the third time . We were all a little hysterical by that time , but we did it quickly and started moving again . drove on very slowly but I did n't stop for stop-signs , or red lights , or a State trooper , or anything else . We met the team and their owner all right . His hired man , who drove them from then on , was a very sad Negro with a peg leg , and something in his face made me know there was n't any use getting so excited : it would turn out all right , one way or another . Then we had a long wait for the covered wagon and oxen from Massachusetts via Marietta . We all spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more work on Mr. Locksley 's beard . While we were busy at this another old man came up to me and said : " That 's just what the world needs to-day . " " What 's that ? " I asked . " Beards ? " " Religion , " he said . " It 's all right with me , " I said , plying the scissors . Finally the celebrated covered wagon and oxen appeared , and they did n't look like much to us , after all . Perhaps we just did n't like the oxen . They took the lead , and they were followed by an ox-drawn float of the Seal of Ohio , which was followed by a couple of stupid floats of the ordinary kind , with cuties , tissue paper , and advertising . Johnny Apple-seed brought up the rear . V When the little parade finally started I got a hammer and some pliers and nails out of my truck for emergencies and followed along the sidewalk with Joc Copper . It was a good thing I did , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in turn smashed the Seal of Ohio , but not beyond a few hasty repairs . I also had to grab a State trooper to help me because our tree had to go way round the traffic lights instead of under them , and at the street corners people were crowded far into the street and had to be pushed back . When I took up farming I did n't know it was going to involve handling people at parades , but then I did n't know much about it . And it was worth it , all right . It was all worth it . A few hasty glances back at our float proved that . At the end of that silly little parade our great tree , with its leaves and apples shining in the sunlight , was really something . And Mr. Locks-ley was n't there any more . Standing there before the tree in the little nursery leaning on his staff , with his Bible in his hand , looking out remotely in his incomparable dignity and beauty at the clapping crowd and staring , awe-struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiver down more spines than mine . When we reached the end I was in a bit of a daze , but I remembered that someone had said Johnny could be got on the radio in front of the courthouse . This seemed a bit out of key , but I remembered that farm organizations , like all others , can use good publicity , and I knew that Mr. Locksley could dominate any situation . The old Negro with the peg leg knew where to take the team and float , and I got Mr. Locksley off the float and we hurried silently through the crowd . When we got near the courthouse the crowd was so thick that we could n't make any headway . An old newspaper editor I know , who has a bad heart at that , saw our plight and jammed his way through ahead of us like a trooper . The announcer saw us and made a few remarks , and then Johnny Appleseed was standing there before a microphone . Once again that strange thing happened , and quiet spread out a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I lived in this part of the country a long time ago , when it had hardly been touched . I liked the Indians and I liked the white people and I liked the animals , and I did n't hurt any of them . I planted seeds and set out apple trees for the settlers , and I took care of them . I told the people about God , and I tried to be a good man myself . I tried to be a good American , on this land we had found . Maybe I was , a little . Maybe I 'm not dead yet . " With that he turned away , and after a minute there was a kind of exclamation from the crowd , mixed with clapping . Then he got down from the platform and gave the seedlings he had left to the children in the crowd , until they were all gone . Then I found Mr. Locksley , and we smiled at each other a little wearily and shook hands and found our cars and went home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have seen all these people again and again since then , and we have n't heard one word said about it . I feel sure that there has been little or no talk about it of any kind . I feel equally sure that there has been some tall thinking about it . To what effect , I do n't know . But in another hundred and fifty years we may not miss the big parade , and in another hundred and fifty years we may still be producing the real thing .
