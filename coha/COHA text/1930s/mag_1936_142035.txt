To every good U. S. citizen the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November is a date that needs no explanation . Not so the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December . Never has this date meant anything special to anyone , but this year it did . Under an amendment to the U. S. Code , adopted in 1934 after the adoption of the Lame Duck Amendment of the Constitution , the Electoral College met then instead of on the first Wednesday in January . <P> So to 48 capitals trooped the 531 U. S. citizens who alone among the 127,000,000 have the legal right to elect the President and Vice President of the U. S. Under a proposed amendment to the U. S. Constitution , long talked of and again being agitated by Senator George Norris of Nebraska , this right would be taken from them and given to the people . But long ago the same unwritten Constitution of the U. S. which denies any President the right to more than eight years in office , deprived the electors of their power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , reduced them to the status of political stooges . <P> Typical was the largest Electoral College , which assembled in Albany , N. Y. Among the 47 electors who drew their $15 day 's pay , their 10 a mile travel allowance and their free souvenir fountain pens ( for signing oaths and official certifications ) were , besides numerous ward bosses , four women , such political war horses as one-time Ambassador James W. Gerard , one-time Editor Herbert Bayard Swope , one-time Police Commissioner Grover A. Whalen , Roosevelt Friend Frank C. Walker , such reigning Labor Union chiefs as Sidney Hillman ( Amalgamated Clothing Workers ) , Joseph P. Ryan ( International Longshoremen ) , Max Zaritsky ( United Hatters , Cap &; Millinery Workers ) , David Dubinsky ( International Ladies ' Garment Workers ) . Also present were Governor Lehman and the past President of the New York college , not this year a member , James Aloysius Farley . <P> A full day 's work they made : assembled in the State Capitol , elected temporary officers , adjourned , held a luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No little X 's did they have to make on roughly printed ballots . Their ballots were handsomely engraved in exactly the same style as the ballots used in New York to elect Grover Cleveland 52 years ago , saying simply " For President of the U. S. , Franklin D. Roosevelt of the State of New York , " " For Vice President of the U. S. , John N. Garner of the State of Texas , " and since State officials had with foresight had 200 engraved four years ago , there remained , even after 47 had been cast and scores distributed as souvenirs , 60 left over for this year . For Roosevelt &; Garner , 47 votes . <P> In Harrisburg , Pennsylvania 's Electoral College ( president , Mathew H. McCloskey Jr. , Philadelphia contractor ) heard Governor George H. Earle declare that all this electoral nonsense was out of date , just like state 's Rights . For Roosevelt &; Garner , 36 gilt-edged cards in a green glass urn.               @ @ @ @ @ @
