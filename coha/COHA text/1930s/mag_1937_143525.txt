Outside Madison Square Garden one night this week , pickets paraded up and down , beseeching Manhattanites not to spend money that might go to Nazi Germany . Inside , 17,000 boxing fans were clamorously awaiting another chance to see in action the famed right fist that had once felled Heavyweight Champion Joe <P> Louis . The possessor of that fist , Germany 's beetle-browed Max Schmeling , presumably was warming up for an opportunity to win the title next summer from Champion Louis . After he had knocked out Louis , Schmeling thought he was to meet Jim Braddock for the championship , but Braddock believed he could make more money fighting Louis . Schmeling 's opponent this week , a burly blond named Harry Thomas , was a comparative unknown , a college graduate who had been a professional baseball player and railroad engineer , had knocked out 44 of his 56 opponents in five years of professional boxing , had never been knocked down . <P> There was a great roar as Max Schmeling and Harry Thomas clambered through the thick maroon ropes that enclose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumbled orders in the centre of the ring , the fighters moved back to their corners , and the bell clanged . Both came out in a crouch , eyed each other for a moment . Then Thomas cracked Schmeling with a tentative left , first blow of an uncommonly bloody fight . <P> From the first round it was obvious that an 18-month layoff had rusted Schmeling . He usually is a slow starter , but his timing was unusually poor as Thomas , flailing awkwardly with his right hand sometimes ahead of his left , tapped him at will and won the round . In the second , Thomas landed a low blow and was penalized the round , but it did not belong to him anyway . Schmeling had cut his nose and lip . <P> Schmeling continued to fight in his cool , planned style , moving faster and landing oftener in each successive round . In the fifth , Schmeling was behind on points and finally let loose his right . It caught Thomas clean on the chin , and Schmeling blinked . Thomas did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hooks that purpled his face and body . Schmeling stepped his pace up a notch . <P> In the sixth round Schmeling started smashing Thomas oftener . Thomas ' face dripped blood , but he fought back hard . At the end of the round he was groggy . In the seventh Thomas grew weaker under the pounding . Just before the bell , for the first time in his career , he finally dropped to the canvas . For the eighth round , Thomas walked into the ring bleary-eyed . Schmeling hit him with a right and he went down again . Schmeling confidently turned to a neutral corner , but at the count of " One , " Thomas was up after him . Schmeling slugged him again , and again he arose at " One . " Four more times he went down under Max Schmeling 's famed " Sunday punch , " and each time rose ready to fight . The crowd , sickened by the sight , screamed " Stop it , stop it . " Referee Donovan stepped between the two and beckoned Schmeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope now I will be entitled to a fight for the championship against Joe Louis . "
