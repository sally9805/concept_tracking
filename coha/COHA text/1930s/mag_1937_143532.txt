U. S. religious cultsters , practicing esoteric arts for the weak in spirit and confused in mind , have their quota of quacks and racketeers , their full share of psychotics . Last week in Chicago an egregious religionist , who in his time had attracted the notice of both police and psychiatrists , was discovered by the Chicago Times ( tabloid ) to be " doing business at the same old stand . " He was Giuseppe Maria Abbate , 51 , onetime convict , onetime maniac , known to his 100-odd present followers as the " Celestial Messenger . " <P> " Padre " Abbate 's people believe that he was not born of mortal parents but formed from " the ashes of Jesus Christ . " Once he crowned the small daughter of one of his Italian-born parishioners , Mrs. Grace Ippolita , as " the Virgin Mary , " instructing his followers to worship her . In 1923 the " Celestial Messenger " was convicted of ravishing a small girl , was adjudged insane . Convicted later of two more attacks , Abbate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original insanity . In the Elgin State Hospital ( Illinois ) , where he spent two years , clad in clerical garb , Abbate became a prime exhibit for psychology classes from Chicago universities , readily telling students of the messages and visions he experienced . Last week " Padre " Abbate was installed once more , surrounded by men and women in monastic robes , in a three-story house containing his church and living quarters . He posed for photographers , wearing vestments resembling a bishop 's and a mitre bearing cabalistic words , with one of his tonsured " monks " by his side . He held services for his people , giving them " the sacraments , " for , as his housekeeper explained , " we are really a Roman Catholic church although we are not under the Pope . " But when the press began getting too inquisitive , " Padre " Abbate secreted himself , had a sign put on the door : For Members Only .                   @ @
