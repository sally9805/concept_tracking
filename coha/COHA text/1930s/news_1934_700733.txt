txt Excerpts From Letters on Many Subjects Plea for Plus Fours . Now that we see on all sides many gratifying signs of a return to better times , may we not hope for the rapid disappearance of some of the fashions. especially in men 's attire , that came in with the depression ? I have in mind , particularly , the sloppy trousers or " slacks " now worn by many men on golf courses . Aside from the  --  untidy appearance of these habiliments , they will always be associated in the public mind with the bad times which , I hope , will soon be but a memory . The gay plus fours with the bright stockings and the golfy look are already much in evidence on the Scotch and English courses . Let us hope they will also gain favor here in the near future , if for no other reason than to furnish omens of better ' and happier times. ? HELEN ST . JOHN , Saint George , N.
