er50411 i% L ; 61rVigr THE HOUND A STORY BY WILLIAM FAULKNER T O COTTON the shot was the loudest thing he had ever heard in his life . It was too loud to he heard all at once . It continued to build up about the thicket , the dim , faint road , long after the hammerhke blow of the ten-gage shotgun had shocked into his shoulder and long after the smoke of the black powder with which it was charged had dissolved , and after the maddened horse had whirled twice and then turned galloping , diminishing , the empty stirrups clashing against the empty saddle . It made too much noise . It was outrageous , unbelievable  --  a gun which he had owned for twenty years . It stunned him with amazed outrage , seeming to press him down into the thicket , so that when he could make the second shot , it was too late and the hound too was gone . Then he wanted to run . He had expected that . He had coached himself the night before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told himself . " But you ca n't run . You got to finish it . You got to clean it up . It will be hard , but you got to do it . You got to set there in the bushes and shut your eyes and count slow until you can make to finish it . " He did that . He laid the gun down and sat where he had lain behind the log . His eyes were closed . He counted slowly , until he had stopped shaking and until the sound of the gunand the echo of the galloping horse had died out of his ears . He had chosen his place well . It was a quiet road , little used , marked not once in three months save by that departed horse ; a short cut between the house where the owner of the horse lived and Varner 's store ; a quiet , fading , grass-grown trace along the edge of the river bottom , empty save for the two of them , the one squatting in the bushes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bachelor . He lived in a chinked log cabin floored with clay on the edge of the bottom , four miles away . It was dusk when he reached home . In the well-house at the back he drew water and washed his shoes . They were not muddier than usual , and he did not wear them save in severe weather , but he washed them carefully . Then he cleaned the shotgun and washed it too , barrel and stock ; why , he could not have said , since he had never heard of finger prints , and immediately afterward he picked up the gun again and carried it into the house and put it away . He kept firewood , a handful of charred pine knots , in the chimney corner . He built a fire on the clay hearth and cooked his supper and ate and went to bed . He slept on a quilt pallet on the floor ; he went to bed by barring the door and removing his overalls and lying down . It was dark after the fire burned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all save that he did not expect to sleep . He felt no triumph , vindication , nothing . He just lay there , thinking about nothing at all , even when he began to hear the dog . Usually at night he would hear dogs , single dogs ranging alone in the bottom , or coon- or cat-hunting packs . Having nothing else to do , his life , his heredity , and his heritage centered within a five-mile radius of Varner 's store . He knew almost any dog he would hear by its voice , as he knew almost any man he would hear by his voice . He knew this dog 's voice . It and the galloping horse with the flapping stirrups and the owner of the horse had been inseparable : where he saw one of them , the other two would not be far away  --  a lean , rangy brute that charged savagely at anyone who approached its master 's house , with something of the master 's certitude and overbearance ; and to-day was not the first time he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why he had not gone through with it . " I never knowed my own luck , " he said to himself , lying on the pallet . " I never knowed . If I had went ahead and killed it , killed the dog . . " He was still not triumphant . It was too soon yet to be proud , vindicated . It was too soon . It had to do with death . He did not believe that a man could pick up and move that irrevocable distance at a moment 's notice , He had completely forgotten about the body . So he lay with his gaunt , underfed body empty with waiting , thinking of nothing at all , listening to the dog . The cries came at measured intervals , timbrous , sourceless , with the sad , peaceful , abject quality of a single hound in the darkness , when suddenly he found himself sitting bolt upright on the pallet . " Nigger talk , " he said . He had heard ( he had never known a negrohimself , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and negroes ) how negroes claimed that a dog would howl at the recent grave of its master . " Hit 's nigger talk , " he said all the time he was putting on his overalls and his recently cleaned shoes . He opened the door . From the dark river bottom below the hill on which the cabin sat the howling of the dog came , bell-like and mournful . From a nail just inside the door he took down a coiled plowline and descended the slope . Against the dark wall of the jungle fireflies winked and drifted ; from beyond the black wall came the booming and grunting of frogs . When he entered the timber he could not see his own hand . The footing was treacherous with slime and creepers and bramble . They possessed the perversity of inanimate things , seeming to spring out of the darkness and clutch him with spiky tentacles . From the musing impenetrability ahead the voice of the hound came steadily . He followed the sound , muddy again ; the air was chill , yet he was sweating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased . He plunged forward , his teeth drying under his dry lip , his hands clawed and blind , toward the ceased sound , the faint phosphorescent glare of the dog 's eyes . The eyes vanished . He stopped , panting , stooped , the plowline in his hand , looking for the eyes . He cursed the dog , his voice a dry whisper , He could hear silence but nothing else . He crawled on hands and knees , telling where he was by the shape of the trees on the sky . After a time , the brambles raking and slashing at his face , he found a shallow ditch . It was rank with rotted leaves ; he waded ankle-deep in the pitch darkness , in something not earth and not water , his elbow crooked before his face . He stumbled upon something ; an object with a slack feel . When he touched it , something gave a choked , infantlike cry , and he started back , hearing the creature scuttle away . " Just a possum , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands on his flanks in order to pick up the shoulders . His flanks were foul with slime . He wiped his hands on his shirt , across his breast , then he picked up the shoulders . He walked backward , dragging it . From time to time he would stop and wipe his hands on his shirt . He stopped beside a tree , a rotting cypress shell , topless , about ten feet tall . He had put the coiled plowline into his bosom . He knotted it about the body and climbed the stump . The top was open , rotted out . He was not a large man , not as large as the body , yet he hauled it up to him hand over hand , bumping and scraping it along the stump , until it lay across the lip like a half-filled meal sack . The knot in the rope had slipped tight . At last he took out his knife and cut the rope and tumbled the body into the hollow stump . It did n't fall far . He shoved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstruction ; he tied the rope about the stub of a limb and held the end of it in his hands and stood on the body and began to jump up and down upon it , whereupon it fled suddenly beneath him and left him dangling on the rope . He tried to climb the rope , rasping off with his knuckles the rotten fiber , a faint , damp powder of decay like snuff in his nostrils . He heard the stub about which the rope was tied crack and felt it begin to give . He leaped upward from nothing , scrabbling at the rotten wood , and got one hand over the edge . The wood crumbled beneath his fingers ; he climbed perpetually without an inch of gain , his mouth cracked upon his teeth , his eyes glaring at the sky . The wood stopped crumbling . He dangled by his hands , breathing . He drew himself up and straddled the edge . He sat there for a while . Then he climbed down and leaned against the hollow trunk . When he reached his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so tired . He stopped at the door . Fireflies still blew along the dark band of timber , and owls hooted and the frogs still boomed and grunted . " I ai n't never been so tired , " he said , leaning against the house , the wall which he had built log by log . " Like ever thing had got outen hand . Climbing that stump , and the noise that shot made . Like I had got to be somebody else without knowing it , in a place where noise was louder , climbing harder to climb , without knowing it . " He went to bed . He took off the muddy shoes , the overalls , and lay down ; it was late then . He could tell by a summer star that came into the square window at two o'clock and after . Then , as if it had waited for him to get settled and comfortable , the hound began to howl again . Lying in the dark , he heard the first cry come up from the river bottom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squatted against the wall of Varner 's store . Cotton made the sixth . He sat on the top step , his hack against a gnawed post which supported the wooden awning of the veranda . The seventh man sat in the single splint chair ; a fat , slow man in denim trousers and a collarless white shirt , smoking a cob pipe . He was past middle-age . He was sheriff of the county . The man about whom they were talking was named Houston . " He had n't no reason to run off , " one said . " To disappear . To send his horse back home with a empty saddle . He had n't no reason . Owning his own land , his house . Making a good crop ever year . He was as well-fixed as ere a man in the county . A bachelor too . He had n't no reason to disappear . You can mark it . He never run . I do n't know what ; but Houston never run . " " I do n't know , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has got in his mind . Houston might a had reason that we do n't know , for making it look like something had happened to him . For clearing outen the country and leaving it to look like something had happened to him . It 's been done before . Folks before him has had reason to light out for Texas with a changed name . " Cotton sat a little below their eyes , his face lowered beneath his worn , stained , shabby hat . He was whittling at a stick , a piece of pine board . " But a fellow ca n't disappear without leaving no trace , " a third said . " Can he , Sheriff ? " " Well , I do n't know , " the Sheriff said . He removed the cob pipe and spat neatly across the porch into the dust . " You ca n't tell what a man will do when he 's pinched . Except it will be something you never thought of . Never counted on . But if you can find just what pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Houston was smart enough to do ere a thing he taken a notion to , " the second said . " If he 'd wanted to disappear , I reckon we 'd a known about what we know now . " " And what 's that ? " the third said . " Nothing , " the second said . " That 's a fact , " the first said . " Houston was a secret man . " " He was n't the only secret man around here , " a fourth said . To Cotton it sounded sudden , since the fourth man had said no word before . He sat against the post , his hat slanted forward so that his face was invisible , believing that he could feel their eyes . He watched the sliver peel slow and smooth from the stick , ahead of his worn knife-blade . " I got to say something , " he told himself . " He war n't no smarter than nobody else , " he said . Then he wished he had not spoken . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stick , watching the knife , the steady sliver . " It 's got to trim off smooth , " he told himself . " It do n't dast to break . " He was talking ; he could hear his voice : " Swelling around like he was the biggest man in the county . Setting that ere dog on folks ' stock . " He believed that he could feel their eyes , watching their feet , watching the sliver trim smooth and thin and unhurried beneath the knife blade . Suddenly he thought about the gun , the loud crash , the jarring shock . " Maybe I 'll have to kill them all , " he said to himself  --  a mild man in worn overalls , with a gaunt face and lack-luster eyes like a sick man , whittling a stick with a thin hand , thinking about killing them . " Not them ; just the words , the talk . " But the talk was familiar , the intonation , the gestures ; but so was Houston . He had known Houston all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a dog , " Cotton said , watching the knife return and bite into another sliver . " A dog that et better than me . I work , and eat worse than his dog . If I had been his dog , I would not have . .. We 're better off without him , " he said , blurted . He could feel their eyes , sober , intent . " He always did rile Ernest , " the first said . " He taken advantage of me , " Cotton said , watching the infallible knife . " He taken advantage of ever man he could . " " He was a overbearing man , " the Sheriff said . Cotton believed that they were still watching him , hidden behind their detached voices . " Smart , though , " the third said . " He was n't smart enough to win that suit against Ernest over that hog . " " That 's so . Haw much did Ernest get outen that Jawing ? He ai n't never told , has he ? " Cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suit . The hog had come into his lot one October . He penned it up ; he tried by inquiry to find the owner . But none claimed it until he had wintered it on his corn . In the spring Houston claimed the hog . They went to court . Houston was awarded the hog , though he was assessed a sum for the wintering of it , and one dollar as pound-fee for a stray . " I reckon that 's Ernest 's business , " the Sheriff said after a time . Again Cotton heard himself talking , blurting . " It was a dollar , " he said , watching his knuckles whiten about the knife handle . " One dollar . " He was trying to make his mouth stop talking . " After all I taken offen him . . . " " Juries does queer things , " the Sheriff said , " in little matters . But in big matters they 're mostly right . " Cotton whittled , steady and deliberate . " At first you 'll want to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish it . You got to count a hundred , if it needs , and finish it . " " I heard that dog again last night , " the third said . " You did ? " the Sheriff said . " It ai n't been home since the day the horse come in with the saddle empty , " the first said . " It 's out hunting , I reckon , " the Sheriff said . " It 'll come in when it gets hungry . " Cotton trimmed at the stick . He did not move . " Niggers claim a hound 'll howl till a dead body 's found , " the second said . " I 've heard that , " the Sheriff said . After a time a car came up and the Sheriff got into it . The car was driven by a deputy . " We 'll be late for supper , " the Sheriff said . The car mounted the hill ; the sound died away . It was getting toward sundown . " He ai n't much bothered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the first said . " After all , a. man can leave his house and go on a trip without telling ever-body . " " Looks like he 'd a unsaddled that mare , though , " the second said . " And there 's something the matter with that dog . It ai n't been home since , and it ai n't treed . I been hearing it ever night . It ai n't treed . It 's howling . It ai n't been home since Tuesday . And that was the day Houston rid away from the store here on that mare . " Cotton was the last one to leave the store . It was after dark when he reached home . He ate some cold bread and loaded the shotgun and sat beside the open door until the hound began to howl . Then he descended the hill and entered the bottom . The dog 's voice guided him ; after a while it ceased , and he saw its eyes . They were now motionless ; in the red glare of the explosion he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the act of leaping into the ensuing welter of darkness ; he heard the thud of its body . Rut he could n't find it . He looked carefully , quartering back and forth , stopping to listen . But he had seen the shot strike it and hurl it backward , and he turned aside for about a hundred yards in the pitch darkness and came to a slough . He flung the shotgun into it , hearing the sluggish splash , watching the vague water break and recover , until the last ripple died . He went home and to bed . He did n't go to sleep though , although he knew he would not hear the dog . " It 's dead , " he told himself , lying on his quilt pallet in the dark . " I saw the bullets knock it down . THE HOUND g71 could count the shot . The dog is dead . " But still he did not sleep . He did not need sleep ; he did not feel tired or stale in the mornings , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not hear the dog again , and that sleep had nothing to do with the dog . So he took to spending the nights sitting up in a chair in the door , watching the fireflies and listening to the frogs and the owls . He entered Varner 's store . It was in mid-afternoon ; the porch was empty , save for the clerk , whose name was Snopes . " Been looking for you for two-three days , " Snopes said . " Come inside . " Cotton entered . The store smelled of cheese and leather and new earth . Snopes went behind the counter and reached from under the counter a shotgun . It was caked with mud . " This is yourn , ai n't it ? " Snopes said . " Vernon Tull said it was . A nigger squirl hunter found it in a slough . " Cotton came to the counter and looked at the gun . He did not touch it ; he just looked at it . " It ai n't mine , " he said . " Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten-gages except you , " Snopes said . " Tull says it 's yourn . " " It ai n't none of mine , " Cotton said . " I got one like it . But mine 's to home . " Snopes lifted the gun . He breeched it . " It had one empty and one bowl in it , " he said . " Who you reckon it belongs to ? " " I do n't know , " Cotton said . " Mine 's to home . " He had come to purchase food . He bought it : crackers , cheese , a tin of sardines . It was not dark when he reached home , yet he opened the sardines and ate his supper . When he lay down he did not even remove his overalls . It was as though he waited for something , stayed dressed to move and go at once . He was still waiting for whatever it was when the window turned gray and then yellow and then blue ; when , framed by the square window , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise there were three of them , and then seven . All that day he watched them gather , wheeling and wheeling , drawing their concentric black circles , watching the lower ones wheel down and down and disappear below the trees . He thought it was the dog . " They 'll be through by noon , " he said . " It was n't a big dog . " When noon came they had not gone away ; there were still more of them , while still the lower ones dropped down and disappeared below the trees . He watched them until dark came , until they went away , flapping singly and sluggishly up from beyond the trees . " I got to eat , " he said . " With the work I got to do to-night . " He went to the hearth and knelt and took up a pine knot , and he was kneeling , nursing a match into flame , when he heard the hound again ; the cry deep , timbrous , unmistakable , and sad . He cooked his supper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his meager corn patch . The cries of the hound could have guided him , but he did not need it . He had not reached the bottom before he believed that his nose was guiding him . The dog still howled . He paid it no attention , until the beast sensed him and ceased , as it had done before ; again he saw its eyes . He paid no attention to them . He went to the hollow cypress trunk and swung his axe into it , the axe sinking helve-deep into the rotten wood . While he was tugging at it something flowed silent and savage out of the darkness behind him and struck him a slashing blow . The axe had just come free ; he fell with the axe in his hand , feeling the hot reek of the dog 's breath on his face and a faint patch of starry sky . " I ai n't hearing the click of its teeth as he never been so tired , " he said . The dog struck it down with his free hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ; he saw its eyes now .

Watching the dog , He began to chop at the base of the he stooped and found a stick . It was stump , stopping between blows to rotten , foul with slime . He clutched listen . But he heard nothing , saw it . When the hound lifted its muzzle nothing . Overhead the stars were to howl , he struck .

He did n't have time to turn when the When the body came free , Cotton hound struck him and knocked him went over backward . He lay on his down . It did n't pause . Lying on his back on the wet ground , looking up at back , he saw it in midair like a bird , vanish into the mist with a single short , choking cry . He got to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . It was full light . He could see the stump and the black hole which he had chopped in it ; behind him he could hear the swift , soft feet of the dog . As it sprang at him he stumbled and fell and saw it soar over him , its eyes like two cigar-coals ; it whirled and leaped at him again before he could rise . He struck at its face with his bare hands and began to run . Together they reached the tree . It leaped at him again , slashing his arm as he ducked into the tree , seeking that member of the body which he did not know was missing until after he had released it into the mist , feeling the dog surging about his legs . Then the dog was gone . Then a voice said : " We got him . You can come out , Ernest . " The countyseat was fourteen miles away . They drove to it in a battered Ford . On the back seat Cotton and the Sheriff sat , their inside wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two miles before they reached the highroad . It was hot , ten o'clock in the morning . " You want to swap sides out of the sun ? " the Sheriff said . " I 'm all right , " Cotton said . At two o'clock they had a puncture . Cotton and the Sheriff sat under a tree while the driver and the second deputy went across a field and returned with a glass jar of buttermilk and some cold food . They ate , repaired the tire , and went on . When they were within three or four miles of town , they began to pass wagons and cars going home from market day in town , the wagon teams plodding homeward in their own inescapable dust . The Sheriff greeted them with a single gesture of his fat arm . " Home for supper , anyway , " he said . " What 's the matter , Ernest ? Feeling sick ? Here , Joe ; pull up a minute . " " I 'll hold my head out , " Cotton said . " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head out the V strut of the top stanchion . The Sheriff shifted his arm , giving him play . " Go on , " Cotton said , " I 'll be all right . " The car went on . Cotton slipped a little farther down in the seat . By moving his head a little he could wedge his throat into the apex of the iron V , the uprights gripping his jaws beneath the ears . He shifted again until his head was tight in the vise , then he swung his legs over the door , trying to bring the weight of his body sharply down against his imprisoned neck . He could hear his vertebrae ; he felt a kind of rage at his own toughness ; he was struggling then against the jerk on the manacle , the hands on him . Then he was lying on his back beside the road , with water on his face and in his mouth , though he could not swallow . He could n't speak , trying to curse , cursing in no voice . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street where children played in the big , shady yards in small bright garments , and men and women went home toward supper , to plates of food and cups of coffee in the long twilight of summer . They had a doctor for him in his cell . When the doctor had gone he could smell supper cooking somewhere  --  ham and hot bread and coffee . He was lying on a cot ; the last ray of copper sunlight slid through a narrow window , stippling the bars upon the wall above his head . His cell was near the common room , where the minor prisoners lived , the ones who were in jail for minor offenses or for three meals a day ; the stairway from below came up into that room . It was occupied for the time by a group of negroes from the chain-gang that worked the streets , in jail for vagrancy or for selling a little whiskey or shooting craps fur ten or fifteen cents . One of the negroes was at the window above the street , yelling down to someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murmurous , mellow and singsong . Cotton rose and went to the door of his cell and held to the bars , looking at the negroes . " Hit , " he said . His voice made no sound . He put his hand to his throat ; he produced a dry croaking sound , at which the negroes ceased talking and looked at him , their eyeballs rolling . " It was all right , " Cotton said , " until it started coming to pieces on me . I could a handled that dog . " He held his throat , his voice harsh , dry , and croaking . " But it started coming to pieces on me . . . . " " Who him ? " one of the negroes said . They whispered among themselves , watching him , their eyeballs white in the dusk .

" " Hit would a been all right , " Cotton said , his voice harsh , whispering . Then it failed him again altogether . He held to the bars with one hand , holding his throat with the other , while the negroes watched him , huddled , their eyeballs white and sober . Then with one accord they turned and rushed across the room , toward the staircase ; he heard slow steps and then he smelled food , and he clung to the bars , trying to see the stairs . " Are they going to feed them niggers before they feed a white man ? " he said , smelling the coffee and the ham . THE RATIONAL MAN BY J. C.
