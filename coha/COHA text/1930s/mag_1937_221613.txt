Tumbling out of their classrooms and onto their campus ashiver with excitement one day last week went all the 500 boys and girls of Los Angeles Junior College . The college faculty gathered to watch from a porch . Facing each other on the grass stood sturdy , curly-headed Student Robert Cousineau and wiry Student Harold Bauer , each stripped to the waist and each armed with a sword . As the excited audience chattered and peered , cameramen recorded the scene and newshawks watched intently . With full faculty approval , a duel was about to be fought . When Students Cousineau and Bauer finished posing , they put on fencing masks , but left the tips of their weapons exposed . Captain Fred Schwankovsky of the college fencing team , stepping up to referee , grimly explained that they would use not fencing foils but regulation French pes . As cameras whirred and co-eds squealed , the two boys went into earnest action , lunging , slashing , parrying , feinting , with danger flashing at the needle-points of their weapons . After many lively passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Student Bauer 's arm spurted a red jet of real blood . " Touche ! " cried the referee and the duel was over . <P> Moving spirit of this extraordinary performance , which was claimed to have drawn " the first blood ever intentionally shed by U. S. college fencers , " was Los Angeles Junior 's lively Fencing Coach John Tatum , who exulted : " We have been trying to arrange an affair like this for three years to popularize fencing . " The college publicity department had timed it to coincide with a campus dance . Nothing was at stake except Student Bauer 's desire for the No. 2 rating on the fencing team , which Student Cousineau enjoyed by virtue of his showing in the Pacific Coast fencing tournament last month . Nursing a three-inch cut , Fencer Bauer had to content himself with the No. 3 rating . <P> At Coach Tatum 's implication that fencing is not a sufficiently exciting sport without bloodshed , other college fencing instructors were quick to protest . Snapped Yale 's veteran Robert Grasson : " Very foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsafe . " More impassive was George Santelli , saber coach of the 1936 U. S. Olympic team . Shrugged he : " To approve . . . would be to approve the possibility that someone might be killed , so I do not approve . "
