Toledo 's public-spirited John David Biggers last week resigned his job as administrator of the U. S. Unemployment Census , resumed his job as president of big Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. ( flat glass ) . To his friend Franklin Roosevelt , Mr. Biggers left many a fact &; figure underlining the extent and the why of unemployment . In a letter announcing that the census was complete , he wrote : " The most significant fact ... is that 2,740,000 more persons have entered the labor market since 1930 than were to have been expected from past experience . This entire increase is made up of women workers . . . " On the labor market when Mr. Biggers surveyed it last November were 39,978,000 males , 14,496,000 females between 15 and 74 . Of these , approximately 7,845,016 who registered were " available for employment . " ( Latest conservative estimate of unemployed : 10,500,000 . ) Two and three-quarter million women who in depression clung to jobs rather than husbands were a surprise that made the problem so much worse .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
