AS THE population of the United States growing older , and the better our civilization succeeds the older our population will become . This is a familiar story by now , a story from which many odd and disturbing conclusions have been drawn , but one may say at once that there is no serious ground for dismay at the facts , so far as those facts concern our present decline in birth rate . What that decline will lead to is obvious . It will lead to an opportunity of self-adjustment , on our part , to the problems of technological unemployment . The value of that chance for self-adjustment is so great that it completely overweighs all arguments as to the selective character of our decline in births . The really important phase of this phenomenon concerns not our decline in births but our increase in age . Here we are dealing not with the problematical , but with the inevitable . That there are now more people of 20 to 65 in our population , and fewer under 15 , thanat any time in forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is always trying to get rid of facts by saying that the trend will change . No change of trend in the birth rate can affect this condition for twenty or thirty years , and that is long enough to make us or to break us , depending on how we face what is before us . Nor would immigration on the old-time scale affect it , and that for a very simple reason . Immigration necessarily brings into a country a very high percentage of the mature , of those between 20 and 55 . But that is just the age group in which we now have an abnormal surplus . Since 1920 the American population in that age group has increased by approximately nineteen million , which is three-quarters of our total increase in population . Here in Pennsylvania we expect that age group to account for all of our increase in population between 1930 and 1940 . This fact , whose significance for the unemployment problem seems never to have been stressed , is due , in its turn , to the very high birth rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rising prosperity of those boom years on the south European and not on the North American plan . Prosperity made them have more children instead of less . In the second , third , and all later generations this tendency is reversed wherever a high standard of living can do battle against biology . Now those children , so generously begotten , have become grown men and women hunting for jobs , and the full load produced on our economy by that fact has not yet developed . There are not so many jobs to-day as there were in 1929 ; but there are , in the United States , about nine million more mature people than in 1929 . Q.E.D. we have unemployment , and Q.E.D. we should also have unemployment if we had maintained the pace of industrial growth we experienced between 1929 and 1930 ; for at the very peak of 1929 there were fewer employed in manufacturing , mining , and agriculture than in 1920 , and , as anyone may read in the United States Census reports , the great industrial State of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years . So we shall not , if we are economically sane , admit more mature immigrants into our country in the near future . By 1955 we may begin to experience a balance of labor and opportunity , or perhaps by 1950 . Ten years later than that we may need immigrants again if our birth rate does not rise , because by 1960 our present abnormally small population below age 15 will be mature , and that abnormally small working population ( abnormal by present and past standards ) will have an abnormally large ageing population to provide for . And that will be true unless the United States becomes a less healthy place in the future than it has been in the past . So the facts are here and will continue MAGAZINE to be here with increasing emphasis for as long as most of us need to think ahead . II From here on I must depart from convention , yet it is a convention that will have to be abandoned sooner or later if we are to get anywhere in our public thinking . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in all our political debates , that our present dilemmas are caused by economic forces alone . But they have not been caused by economic forces alone , but also by social customs and types of desire which are often , in their operation , anti-economic as to the individual , and as to his whole class in society . As our problems have been approached with attention only to one half of their cause , and that attention bemused by memory of boom days succeeding the War , none of the problems has been solved , nor could any of them ever have been solved by a purely economic approach . It is to illustrate this fact that our policy in regard to dependent old age is now being examined . The demands of the ageing are already becoming emphatic and the power of the ageing as a pressure group is recognized in politics everywhere . It is a pressure group with a real problem : What is to be done for our growing population of ageing men and women who have not , because of economic changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this vital question has ever been popularized . That answer is for the State to provide a cash income for all those over 65 , 60 , or even 55 ; which means that the mature , instead of supporting and providing for their own ageing parents must provide even more liberally for ageing parents in general . And they must undertake to do so because the personal problem of looking after one 's elders is getting beyond the economic means of the present generation . It has become so because most of us now live to age sixty and not to age thirty-five . Put that way , the problem can not be solved except by borrowing money and hoping that the payoff will not come until after we are out of the picture . And that is , in effect , what is being done . But before we surrender ourselves to such a counsel of despair it will be profitable to examine the one factor which is rarely , or never , brought into this insoluble equation . That factor is the actual needs of the aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this way with old people in every country in the modern world : they are often poor and unhappy , but they are not unhappy solely because they are poor . They are also unhappy because they are old . For age in the world which we have created and accepted is the ultimate tragedy , the most devastating experience of life . That fact meant little nationally when age was in an extreme minority among our people , but it means much to-day and will mean more to-morrow . Like so many of us here in America , the aged have been given the idea or have acquired the idea that all they need for happiness is money . They do need money . They do need adequate support . But money is not the cure for the unhappiness of old age . And the unhappiness of old age is a growing menace to our institutions . To repeat the statement with which I began : on the basis of our present facts we may be sure that for the next thirty years we shall be developing a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good national living , whether economically or politically , to allow those years to be years of increasing unhappiness and uselessness to our coming majority . It will not be safe for America to permit the present psychology of old age to dominate even a powerful minority of our citizens . The political possibilities inherent in the conventional psychology of old age are deeply disturbing . I am not referring to the Townsend plan more than to the half dozen political campaigns wagedin 1936 in an effort to attract votes by holding out illusory promises of financial abundance to the aged . In 1936 most of those campaigns were lost . Under similar conditions in 1948 or 1952 they will not be lost , though the possibility of redeeming those pledges will be far less in 1952 than they were in 1936 , for the reason that the old will be more numerous and more politically powerful just when the young and productive will be relatively few , and it is the young who must bear the burden of producing whatever wealth is to be shared . It is our tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aged ; but there is a very great difference between the practical operation of that instinct between , say , 1850 when the life expectancy was 35 years , and to-day when it is 60 and going higher . In 1850 , in a world teeming with aggressive youth , old age was a distinction and not a problem . To-day it is a problem and not a distinction . Arthur Garfield Hayes has told us truly that Democracy works . That it has worked for us there is happily no denying . That it will continue to work as happily while our voting majority advances in age depends not on the worth of Democracy but on the wisdom and the normality of the ageing . If we are to solve the problem laid on our doorstep by the immigration policies of fifty years ago , the solution has to begin , not with how to raise two hundred a month for every person over sixty , but with another question altogether : what makes a man feel old ? From what sources spring the political ultraconservatism and , paradoxically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why are they the traditional suckers for oil stock promoters or wild cat mining operators , and why do their imaginations dwell so persistently on the good old days ? HI The most direct , immediate , and earliest acting cause of the feeling of age in a man or woman is a phenomenon for which there is no recognized term . The decline of newcomer enthusiasm is as good a name for it as any . Newcomer enthusiasm is a familiar phenomenon of the prize ring , in most athletic sports , and in fact in every field where experience is not more important than the willingness to endure punishment , or self-punishment , for an intensely desired end . Of itself this characteristic of youth has an effectiveness that is no measure of the physical and mental capacities of those it operates upon . Its power is more evident in football than in baseball , in salesmanship than in the professions . But it operates also in baseball and in the professions . In fact , it operates in every field . Each new generation naturally hails the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It plunges into the possibilities of life with an excitement that can not be matched by those who have lived and experienced the mixed nature of human attainment . In the common domestic life newcomer enthusiasm crowds pleasantly or painfully , but always inevitably , against all the activities of the older generation . No person who has been alive very long can match the intense craving of the young to get the use and possession of all the facilities for human pleasure , except by continuing the adolescent pattern in himself . This is why most men , highly successful in a material way , exhibit with exaggeration all the good and bad emotional and mental characteristics of youth . Every father with a favorite necktie and a son of seventeen in love becomes aware of the eagerness of his son 's desire to get into possession of that one reserved article . It is an affectionate and a harmless type of desire and one which it is our custom to gratify . But its ramifications are endless . It extends to the family car , to the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living rooms , and in fact to all things about a home but those involving domestic laborfor either sex . And that is all strictly natural , but not unimportant . For as we are educating the young to become mature the young are also educating us to become old . Instinctively , and with the connivance of their elders , they monopolize recreation . Along our national trails we are establishing Youth Hostels where young men and women may find shelter at night while engaged in walking tours . This is an admirable enterprise , but is it presumably indecent or indecorous for older men and women to be abroad so far from home ? Must they a little shamefacedly pretend to be young to enjoy shelter from storm and night-flying parasites ? Is it believed to be only the spirit of youth that leads a man or woman to desire free outdoor life ? If so there was never a greater fallacy . Youth is social , gregarious , crowd-loving . It is only maturity that dares face the solitudes of nature , and knows how to enjoy them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share this passion . The spirit of youth is a fine thing , but far less humane and potentially joyous than the spirit of maturity , which has no American reputation at all , save in routine business and the more solemn professions . That blind spot in our thinking and feeling is a powerfully ageing factor in modern life . Youth is conventional , largely unoriginal , indeed , almost exclusively imitative , and has to be . Glorify that and one glorifies whatever is the moment 's fashion , whether communism , fascism , pacifism , or militarism . Youth follows . It rarely leads . Youth 's imitations of maturity are the source of its daring and its occasional enterprise . We are all familiar with the piddling literary attempts of almost all great writers in their youth . That out of such feeble cleverness a personality finally emerges to perform original work and develop authentic feeling and interior power is always a phenomenon little short of the miraculous when it occurs . Yet we remain persistently immune to OLD PEOPLE : A RISING NATIONAL PROBLEM 453 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout much of Europe , idealize just that one characteristic which is our weakness and danger ? the imitative and sentimental restlessness of youth . We do so , still dominated by the psychology of a past when more than fifty per cent of our population was under twenty . That lingering psychology has many forms . The civil service age limits voice its teachings , as do the limitations in many other professions , and the unwritten rules of industry which make even forty the beginning of old age . These bars across the gate of opportunity combine to make the man and woman in middle life believe himself old and on the way to the human junk yard . They make him accept this belief against the testimony of his own blood and brains ; for such influences strike deep into the interior man like a constant trickle of cold water into the boiler fires . Something is saying into the ear of every man and woman over forty in the civilized world , unless that person is mounting on a rising tide of success , " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good as you used to be . " And God help him if he listens . Youth says it , believing that it needs to insist on that chance to make a place for itself . One 's own lazy contemporaries say it to justify their own self-coddlings and abandonment of effort . Something in all men is always looking for an excuse for minimum rather than maximum exertion . Under our prevailing notions the first gray hair gives that magnificent excuse long sought by the indolence of our natures . We look in the glass . We are indeed older . This face is no longer the face which graced the platform at the graduation of the West End High School class . What forty years of sunlight and summer beaches and winter cold have done to our wrinkles and complexions means nothing as to the man or woman inside and has often added an interest and a beauty of power and character that was never there in youth . But it says again to our ignorant selves , " Youare older . You are getting old . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Though that saying begins with a truth and ends with a lie , it steals into the unconscious on the pass word of its first specious truth , and stays there and festers . And our superstitious and lagging social thought approves the formula . By that process a man passes almost immediately from a state in which all of his delinquencies are blamed upon youth and inexperience to one in which they are assigned to the infirmities of advancing years . These things are true in business , in sports , in recreation , and in the professions , and they are also true as to the most intimate details of personal life . One of the most definite characteristics of human nature is one 's instinctive revulsion at love or its activities in any person of one 's own sex ten years older than himself . That is one of the few things which , almost universally , we consider to be ridiculous . As Dr. G. V. Hamilton of Santa Barbara has pointed out in his contribution to the recently published Problems of Ageing , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting to loathing at the thought of their own parents enjoying any physical relationship . The psychoanalysts have pointed out the probable origin of this reaction , and I do not need to do so here . What is often overlooked , however , is that the mature and the ageing have also been young and have felt just this revulsion themselves at love in people of the age to which they have at last attained . And they can not completely have forgotten it . A danger arises which is commonly added to , and often made effectively destructive to personal happiness , by the contempt and ridicule of the young at every hint of sex life in their elders . In addition to these influences there is a large body of ancient superstitions and clich6s , and of modern dogmas , whose combined effect is to convince a man or woman that after two score and tennot to mention three score and ten ? life is over , love is impossible , enterprise and originality must inevitably decline , and the mental and physical powers begin to fail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact . There is no scientific evidence that any age which a human being is likely to experience has as its necessary accompaniment any important loss of the power to live an adequate mental and emotional life . In that study of the characteristics of age , referred to above , a study containing the findings of twenty-five of our foremost biologists , psychologists , and physicians , one looks in vain for confirmation of the popular superstitions concerning old age . Life does not wear men out , mentally or physically . Accident and disease may do so , faulty diet may do so , depressed and discouraged mental states are certain to do so ; but not activity-of mind or body . The psalmist 's " The days of our years are threescore years and ten " was written in a world when the expectation of life at birth was probably not twenty years . But that single phrase still haunts the human memory with a superstition of the plagues that follow our attempts at living on borrowed time . Except for the first year of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other decade . This may be taken as a fulfilment of the old psalmist 's wisdom , predicting in a remote pastoral world a fixed fact for twentieth-century man . Or it may be taken as an evidence of the effect of fatalism and resignation from life upon human mortality . IV I prefer the second interpretation , for whether at three score and ten or at two score , all men and women whom I have known to retire from life and the functions of life have begun at once to grow old and to grow old dangerously . Retirement is in my observation a fatality MAGAZINE and not a blessing . I do not believe it to be a reasonable human goal . It reflects the traditions of a period when , for the average man , life always failed of fulfilment and even the pleasures of maturity were experienced by few . It was a retreat into hiding from the mysteries of disease under a belief that it was the activities of life which wore out the human body instead of keeping it as we know now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1732 . In 1758 , having retired from command of the Virginia militia because of ill health , before the close of the French and Indian War , he wrote , " I have now too much reason to apprehend an approaching decay . " ( Age 26 . ) In 1759 , " I hope to have more happiness in retirement than I ever experienced amidst a wide and bustling world . " ( Age 27 . ) At the outbreak of the Revolution he was summoned from this retirement , against his will , to command the Continental army . It was not mere modesty which prompted the declaration with which he began that task . " I this day declare with the utmost sincerity I do not think myself equal to the command I am honored with . " And to Mrs. Washington , " A trust too great for my capacity . " ( June , 1775 , aged 43 , after seventeen years of rustic retirement . ) Washington 's capacity returned to him , and developed brilliantly . The gentleman farmer became his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the fifty-first year of his age , he wrote , " The scene is at length closed . I will move gently down the stream of life until I sleep with my fathers . " " Heavy and painful oppressions of the head , and other disagreeable sensations often trouble me . " I am " descending the hill I had been fifty-two years climbing . . . of a short lived family . . soon expect to be entombed in the mansion of my fathers . " ( 1784 , aged 52 . ) And finally , " So unwilling am I , in the evening of life . . " ( 1789 . ) Unwilling or not , this retired old man , oppressed with the symptoms of approaching decay , was again drafted by circumstances , dragged from his second retirement , served as President of the Constitutional Convention , and then for eight brilliant years as President of the United States at our nation 's most critical hour . What Washington called retirement would scarcely be considered so to-day , but that the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he did not believe himself to possess is unmistakable from the record . In public office he was rarely seriously ailing ; during his three retirements his failing health is a constant theme of his letters . The average man in retirement to-day has little opportunity for activity or usefulness , and amply justifies all that can be said concerning the debilitating effects of old age . After he steps out of the active scenes of life he is likely to develop those characteristics almost immediately , particularly if he is condemned , or condemns himself , to living with the young . A sudden loss of the sustaining habits and motives that have kept him in active competition for the rewards of labor , can within six months transform the busy lawyer , physician , or merchant into an aged hypochondriac . Duty , as a driving force evoking from a man all of his capacities , goes into reverse . Last year his obligation to his work , to others , and to himself emphatically energized him . This year he has become an obligation to society or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that sudden reversal . The very kindness and well-meant consideration of the young adds an effective depressant to his pride . He reaches out for sympathy as about the only effect left to him to produce , reverting to the behavior patterns of childhood . Or , even worse , as Washington was doing at fifty-one , he begins to study his own organs with anxious attention . But man 's interior arrangements are not designed to be fondled by the imagination . The precise mechanism is not clear , butit is certainly possible for a man with nothing else important to do to so concentrate his attention upon his bodily organs that they become , in part , responsive to conscious thought . But the conscious thought which directs its attention to the heart , the liver , the kidneys , or the functions of digestion and elimination , is invariably pessimistic . An idle old person searches himself for symptoms of decay , as Washington was doing at fifty . And the result of too much thinking , too much amateur anatomizing and self-physicking , to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of a neurotic heart , neurotic kidneys , or stomach and bowels that respond to every emotion . It is not probable that pessimistic thought about the unconscious organs ever killed a man directly , but it is certain that such attention can diminish his vitality , his enjoyment of living , and his awareness of everything but the possibilities of physical disaster . It is man 's exterior , self-controlled machinery which alone thoroughly repays his study , in the search for proper food , proper activity and companionship , and in the attempt to discover uses for life and ability at every age . Some of the greatest tasks ever undertaken by men were undertaken and carried through in what are called life 's declining years . Sophocles completed his Oedipus trilogy at ninety . Titian painted the magnificent Christ of Pity at ninety-nine . At seventy Franklin began the task of gaining for our struggling colonies the alliance of France . At eighty Thomas Edison was deep in research as to the possibility of producing rubber from native American plants . Old Dr. Carver , born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restore and rebuild the economic foundations of negro life in the deep South . It is not necessary that the elderly man or woman should attempt to reverse life habits and to rock the world with a masterpiece of art or a discovery of science , though many have done so ; but it is necessary that activity and usefulness shall be carried on . For any human being to retire into a parasitic life is for him to condemn himself , at once , to a position defenseless against nature . It is no matter whether he become parasitic upon his children , upon society at large , or upon the efforts of his own youth , though the latter is the most respectable and the least unpleasant . But if being able of body and mind , he consents , or is forced to step out of the useful arena of life and to be supported by his juniors , or by his past , he is at once inviting life to retire out of him . I am saying , in brief , that this world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can get little out of it in safety at any age without putting into it a continuous supply of himself . Trying to beat that truth , one puts himself at once into the power of the hostile elements . V Recall for a moment what adverse and unhappy emotions can do to young bodies and young minds . A severe disappointment in love , the loss of a position or of a considerable sum of money , or any failure in achievement can cause severe mental and physical symptoms . Boxers , ball players , writers , painters , and also , to make no invidious comparison , race horses , canary birds , and dogs , exhibit emotional effects on physical and mental output and often in exaggerated forms . In the young , emotional depressions impair the appetite , disorder the digestion , and lead to severe anaemias , of which the chlorosis of girls in their teens is a typical form . Frustration of any sort frequently disorders the regulation of the glands , leads to a loss of interest in life , to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and consequently to that imperfect memory which so frequently plagues the high-school pupil as to French grammar or solid geometry , as a concomitant of early love . Whatever appears to be a hopeless frustration of any important need or impulse in life is likely to lead the human mechanism into a retreat from reality . That retreat into dreams , or into an appeal for sympathy , which Alfred Adler called the Feminine Protest kills one 's awareness of his present scene . But in all human experience there is no circumstance that so discrowns a man as retirement from his part in the active life of the world . When he who produced now only consumes , when he who gave the law receives it , no matter how kindly , when he who was a man among men , is now socially only a child , his life is over in his own inner self-judgment . Unless he has available to himself some source of dominance and pride , he becomes neurotic and retreats into the past . It is notable among old people that the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yesterday is clouded and obscure . Why is this so ? If all memory were obscured we might well hold that the brain cortex had suffered a significant destruction . But all memory is not ordinarily obscured . I have heard a man who could not recall my name , though he had known me for ten years , describe in vivid and minute detail every incident of Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House . Why could he not remember the events of the morning , or of five minutes ago , and recall so well the events of a morning sixty years before ? It is very simple . To-day 's events were obliterated by the humiliation of his obscure and unachieving later years . He was dazed by the collapse of motive . He was very far from being economically disadvantaged , but there was no reality left for him as a man . His mind rejected every incident on the theater of his defeat . He lived only in the past . Our powers of self-protection through mental devices are vast , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , under the conditions of uselessness which are imposed on the old by the forms of modern living , those selfprotecting mechanisms tend to close the doors on reality altogether . Consider how many and how painful the events in each day 's life over which an old man 's attention must glide to preserve him any pride at all , and one sees at once the essence of the problem of old age . With the numbers of the aged growing , it is now a matter of large human importance , not so much to be just to them ? for under democracy they will shortly be able to demand justice for themselves ? but to achieve a reality for them from which they will not need to retreat into the past . In 1930 eighty-seven per cent of all men from 60 to 65 were at work , seventy-nine per cent of all men from 65 to 69 , sixty per cent of all men from 70 to 75 . Cast those men into idleness as a public policy , and we cast American politics into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any world in which the accent of economic life comes to fall upon an idle old age of living in plenty without toiling or spinning is not practicable for human nature . For the good of everybody the old should work . For the good of their minds and bodies they should work , not in competition with the young , in those fields of heavy production in which all employment is now declining , but in all those supplementary directions which are equally needful for a balanced civilization . Any scheme , however well intended , which plunges a large and politically important body of our citizens into retirement , at any age whatever , is dangerous to them and dangerous to our national life . Progressive retirement , gradual relinquishment of function , is the mental and emotional cause of the symptoms of old age . To wish that fate of social uselessness upon any portion of our people , whether they desire it or not , is to evade the problem that is posed for us by human survival , and to do the direct opposite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in certain present phenomena of European statecraft in democratic nations the beginning result of such an evasion . Some may see such results in the political issues of certain of our American States . Whether such deductions are premature or not , this problem is certainly now before us . As to the issue between a policy of generous cash doles and an answer worked out for the good of all , this much can be said . It is not a financial probability that the askings of the old can be met on the scale they now desire , and it is a psychological probability that if we should so meet them we should suffer far graver losses than losses of economic stability . VI There is one clear line of attack which it would be far more humanly profitable for the ageing to pursue than any cause they are now publicly engaged in promoting . That is a fight against compulsory retirement on the basis of age alone , whether in government , industry , or the learned professions . Compulsory retirement is creeping downward , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only for the right not to work . To-day a man stands at the throttle of a great locomotive . To-morrow he is judged , by custom , to be unfit for any form of activity . His forty years of accumulated experience are assessed as worth literally nothing . He is , by one tick of the clock , rendered useless to the industry he has spent his life in serving . That is untrue , unreal , and wasteful of human values . Such a man should still be a railroad man . Perhaps his duties should be lightened or changed , and his time off extended , but to throw away the value of that experience , when it is the one thing that young men coming on in his place most vitally need , is a kind of waste that industry is no longer either successful enough or youthful enough to indulge in . This is true in many lines . No man should be made to retire unless he can find a better use for his time than to continue at some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on no one man , on no one class of men , but on all men , and on all ages , and on all our acquired and accumulated abilities . The old professor is not so quick-witted or so up-to-date as the young instructor , but the chances are high that he has qualities that the young man lacks . Why throw away only the old man 's qualities ? We need them to prevent us swallowing , hook , line , and sinker , every novelty of thought or invention as a world-transforming revolution . We need old men , and it is old men who must fight for their chance to stay real , and to remain a part of the national life and progress . They can not do so by fighting for doles for all people over sixty . In doing so they are asking themselves out of the picture . It is not contended that in many lines this is now a practical solution for the problem of the ageing man . That it is the best solution , where possible , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be first assigned as assistants to older men , who have reached the conventional retirement age , would do much for American education . That on the railroads , or in many industrial occupations where acquired skill is too precious a social value to be thrown into premature decay , such a set-up should be fought for by the ageing is obvious , for the sake of their health and longevity , of their own pride , and for the welfare of the industry they have served . Where that is not possible other occupations must be developed . A first step in that direction is that lately suggested in New York by Assemblyman James J. Wadsworth , that a medical board be appointed to repair an applicant for relief who suffers from a physical defect instead of keeping him , for the balance of his life , dependent on the taxpayers . That the old are capable of education and re-education is a truism among those not bound by superstition . The old can learn whatever it interests them to learn , and though vocational guidance for the ageing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is inevitable that it must become an important form of social and educational effort in the near future . I will not attempt to list here the things which old women can do , or can learn to do with pleasure and advantage . There are , for one instance , forms of weaving and quilting which it seems impossible for the young to carry to the highest perfection , but which are still favorite occupations for the old who have mastered them . Are there too many of such products of hand work in the homes of to-day ? Are not those we possess prized ? And is it not true that the public which does not prize them begins to do so whenever it acquires an opportunity to value anything other than a machine-made product ? For old men there is a great variety of possible occupations . Almost every man is fond of tools , and enjoys some form of construction . But such inclinations have little encouragement or direction in the social conditions of modern urban life . There is neither space for them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme of living . One retired Western business man has devoted his remaining years to gratuitous toy-making . Most men of sixty-five or older have neither the facilities nor capital , nor perhaps the enterprise , if unassisted , which has made that undertaking possible for an individual man . But there are surely never enough toys in this world to satisfy the affectionate destructiveness of youth , nor enough handmade things of every kind . Along such lines are potential occupations for men whose desire for manual creation has been thwarted by mechanical work , whether of the white- or the dark-collar variety . Gardening is another activity for which there exists in most men a thwarted desire . These are suggestions that would seem applicable perhaps only to the least able and to those whose normal skills are not high ; but there is no limit to the range of what I have suggested , for it covers the possibility of service to all the arts and sciences of peace . What could best solve this problem , which is to weigh very heavily , and could even weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old people to solve it for themselves , with whatever help is needed from the people as a whole . Such help should cost far less than any present solutions contemplate . I suggest that the ageing will go very much farther toward happiness and satisfaction , and be on far firmer ground with all the people , if the more far-sighted among them will begin to organize societies for self-help and self-direction , rather than for the promotion of economic experiments of unknown dimension and unforeseeable consequences . The object of such societies could be both social and economic , to provide companionship among the ageing , who are apt to have lost a good deal of it , and to provide a self-sustaining or part-sustaining independence for those who can not be continued in some form of their old employment . I realize that there are prejudices to be overcome . I realize that the ageing do not , as a class , now believe in themselves , nor in their capacities . I realize that they have been for two industrial generations in a contention with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man 's game . But it is not necessary that they should play that game . If they are now dispossessed by the speed of one kind of life , and dispossessed of their social confidence by changes of appearance which make them different from their remembered selves , there is , nevertheless , a world for older men and women , and it is up to them , with the help of us all , to create such a world for themselves . What are the possibilities ? What could be achieved by groups of ageing people , or even colonies of ageing People working and living together , not as inmates but as co-operators ? Not only usefulness and activity , but also love and happiness are attainable by old men andwomen who are not content to succumb to the mental and physical hazards of modern life . The very best physicians of mind and body , men like Barker of Johns Hopkins , assure us that old people can and do recover their interest in life , in love , and in physical pleasure long years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restorations have followed a renewal of motive and a recovery of self-confidence . Suppose every one of us could be assured that at sixty-five or seventy there was still something ahead and something different . Suppose he knew that life still held out for him , at that age , or would hold out for him at that age a renewed opportunity for an independent life , a chance of doing with profit the things life has given him no chance to do before . And suppose he knew that if he needed it , life still held for him a chance for love and happiness among those of his own age , who had learned , or were learning , not to be outfaced by the briskness and the enthusiasm of the young . I think it would make the world a very different place for us all . I do not say that this would ever pay its own way in dollars . But that is not , about this problem , the important question . In dollars it would probably cost far less , now and eventually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social security for the aged as though all that matters is a little money in hand . That matters , but Democracy is just now realizing that keeping itself in emotional health also matters , if our form of government is not to be merely a fair-weather political device , whose success was made possible only by the practically unlimited growth and youthfulness of our past . Having enough money to live on matters seriously to the ageing as to everyone else . But handing out only money does not give to them , nor to the rest of us , any important social security . The time has come when for social security we must think about the problems of the aged in terms of what they really need .
