ADWELLER in Tudor City has begun already to worry about Coolidge 's five-hundred-word history , which is to be inscribed on a mountainside . What , he asks , about the people who live in the valley below that sign ? He himself lives with the Tudor City sign , and he knows what that kind of existence does to one 's character . Twenty four-letter words can he made from the words " Tudor City . " " Tort , " " dour , " " duty , " etc . He makes words all the time , while dressing . and undressing , and he now fears for his compatriots in the valley below the Coolidge inscription . Those people will not only live in the shadow of the thing themselves , but their children and grandchildren  --  for half a million years . The Tudor man thinks two things can happen . They may develop a protective unconsciousness of Mr. Coolidge 's chronicle and the words will stop meaning anything , or the reverse may take place  --  the history may take on a feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty prim narrative , stressing continence , thrift , hard work , and crucifixion of the flesh in the snaking of a great nation . It 's not unlikely that the people who spend their lives looking at it will turn into a had lot  --  drinking hard , riding hard , seducing the peasants , always trying to forget . ONE of the exhibitors at the Aviation Show has written us , re-questing that we tell him just what our editorial policy is in the matter of aviation . He seemed anxious . It 's really pretty hard to say just what we think about aviation , although there 's nothing we 'd rather have than a clear , well-defined aviation policy ; ZLD . err , it would increase our prestige and strengthen our position with our readers , who go through hell every week trying to find out what 's on our mind . It happens that flying is almost our favorite diversion , second only to badminton . We have done as much flying as the next man , in various types of planes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Channel , the Alleghenies , and Central Park . In every case we enjoyed ourself . All the planes we flew in worked well except three  --  one of them refused to rise from the water till somebody got out and jumped up and down on its nose , one of them developed a faulty generator over Holland , and one of them ran out of ! , as over the Alleghenies . Things like that do n't particularly annoy us , but we have to keep them in mind in forming a well-defined aviation policy . Lindbergh is still our personal hero , and the attempt we made to land on a golf course in a snowstorm is still our personal Gethsemane . As for the statement we recently made about the possibility of aviation developing eventually along some other principle than the one on which planes are now built , we suspect there may be something in it . Flying is a celestial experience , and one of the really cloud-draped adventures open to man ; but one only need listen to the noise that a plane makes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ( and what Thomas Edison wants , too ) is a plane that we can park within three blocks of our apartment , and that we can throttle down to four miles an hour  --  so we can land on Aunt Nellie 's lawn in Scarsdale without disturbing the portulaca plants . T has been a garish decade , without I half-lights or overtones . The talk about long skirts for spring reminds us of it again . We hope they lengthen . Bustles would be better and hoop skirts best of all . Everything is too obvious . There ought to be more mystery in life . Between fashions and manners and hooks and psychiatry there has n't been an enigma since the war . Everybody knows everything about everybody else . We long to pick up a publisher 's blurb and read something like this , which we came across in an advertisement from 1896 : " In spite of the plot the tone of the story is moral . Vice is never planted sic before one in gay colors . When it stalks into a chapter it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lost in obscurity , covered over in mystery . " A little more of that , please ! Cacophony TO come right nut with it , the story behind the Mengelherg-Philharmonic situation seems to he this : Whereas the Hollander and Toscanini divided leadership of the orchestra about equally last year , this season the former was relegated definitely to second place . He bore up under it badly . Real trouble beeean last November , when he came back to this country to take his turn with the baton . At his first rehearsal he told the orchestra it had markedly deteriorated during his absence , asked the trombones if they thought they were penny whistles . Now you ca n't say things like that without their getting around . They did , to the discomfiture of the management of the orchestra , always edgy through having to deal so much with people who throw up jobs at the drop of a nasty remark . Mr. Mackay and his associates had always found Toscanini a man not easily piqued and one simple to deal with , but they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to bother about any particular job  --  and here he was threatened with acute embarrassment . Right at this point things began to look black for Mengelberg . Then he astonished all by playing the Cesar Franck Symphony and the Tschaikowski " Romeo and Juliet Overture " with a rougher quality of tone than had been bestowed upon these works in many years . This was probably due to an overwrought state of mind , but it was a catastrophe . Such criticism and muttering ensued that the conductor 's friends had difficulty defending him . At the end he left the country without a contract for his services next season . Some of his supporters felt that at least he should take part in the forthcoming European trip of the Philharmonic , especially as he had done so much for the orchestra in earlier seasons , and it was proposed to extend the tour and thus allow him a few concerts . It appears now that nothing will Come of this . Too much antagonism . ? THERE a r Still a few " L " stations where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a box . A young woman was seen to approach the ticket window at such a place one afternoon and shove a nickel at the attendant there . Heaven knows , he probably has little enough fun and so may be excused for asking her , archly , " How many ? " Not to he outdone , she said , " Two . " He calmly tore one ticket in two pieces and handed them to her . She silently dropped them into the box , smiling . Soup of the Evening VA THEN the late August Belmont V V felt particularly expansive , he would drop in at Waiter T. Smith 's turtle shop in Front Street near the Fulton Market , pick nut a few hundred terrapin from the tanks , and send them to his friends , the Rothschilds . That was in the turtle 's heyday . Every hotel featured green-turtle soup ; no banquet was complete without terrapin . Mr. Smith supplied them all  --  the famous Bradley Martin ball , the Waldorf opening , Delmonico 's , Sherry 's . Nowadays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has departed ; though he still handles more than half a million pounds of turtles a year , he thinks it is nowhere near enough For a city the size of this . In proportion to population , it is far less than when he started business , fifty-two years ago . - Prohibition is largely responsinle . Both terrapin and green turtle must be cooked in sherry , and this has wiped them off most menus . They are still , however , much in demand for banquets , and he sells a good deal to clubs : the Metropolitan , the University , the Racquet and Tennis , as well as the Brook , which makes a specialty of terrapin , and the Union Club , to which he has furnished turtles for forty years . Be still has a few private customers , gourmets all , who come down to the shop and pick out their turtles themselves . The terrapin are caught in the marshes along the coast from Long Island to Georgia , shipped in water , and kept in tanks in the shop . Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are caught along the shore when they come in to lay their eggs in the sand , or in nets anchored over their feeding beds . They can live along time out of water , however . In the shop , they are laid in rows , on their hacks , in a large room where the dealers can inspect them . The best ones range from seventy-five to two hundred and fifty pounds . Really big ones he sends to the Aquarium . Once he got a rare albino terrapin from Louisiana , with pink eyes and a gleaming white shell . Be sent it to the Zoillogical Garden in San Diego . He enjoys his business , and , though now he no longer follows it actively , he often comes in from Long Island to look things over and finger a turtle 's flipper . He loves a good terrapin stew , and considers green-turtle soup , properly prepared , the king of all soups . You can feed it to a three-months-old baby , he says . Chinese customers are numerous at Mr. Smith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese pharmacopoeia has down as a cure for all ailments from sore tooth to lung trouble . Before the shop a sign dangles incongruously , advertising terrapin in Chinese characters  --  pronounced " gim ten guoy . " Unexpected Kh2 dness EARLY one Sunday morning recently a fair lady received , to her surprise , a telephone call from a post-office clerk . His voice came softly over the wire : " Lady , we got a parcel-post package here for you , wit ' Flowers ' marked on it . " He went on to explain that he was worried , because there was no regular parcel-post delivery until Monday morning , and by that time the flowers would have wilted , and what good would they he Now , if she wanted him to , he could put on a special-delivery stamp for her , and send up the package immediately  --  only , she would have to promise solemnly to pay the postman ten cents when he arrived . The lady gratefully assented . Somewhere in the caverns of the Post Office Building , a clerk bought himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The package was rushed uptown by swift messenger . The lady paid the ten cents , and long before tea time had her flowers distributed about the living-room . Rinehart / ACLUMP of sagging commuters were clustered around their gate , waiting for it to open , after the theatre a few nights ago when a long-drawn-out cry " R-i-i-ne-hart ! " rang out across the upper level of Grand Central Terminal and reverberated all about . Most of them were startled and appeared puzzled . One man remarked to his wife that it was funny , he had heard the cry bawled across the midnight darkness of a boulevard in Paris last summer . Ordinarily , in a crowd of this size several people could have given the explanation . It is , as a great many know , a traditional Harvard cry , common in the Yard at Cambridge , especially of a balmy spring night , and one which undergraduates and alumni have shouted for years in railroad terminals , on streets , in theatres , at night clubs  --  in Paris , Japan , Cairo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which served to set us on one of our investigations , undoubtedly issued from an exuberant Harvard man about to hoard a Boston train . We had once been told a story of the origin of the tradition , one which seems to be accepted by the Harvard students of today . It was that about 1900 an eccentric fellow named Rinehart moved into Gray 's Hall and thathe became a friendless and lonely student . He envied the other fellows whose friends were always yelling up at their rooms and ( so the story went ) he took to standing below his own window and singing out his own name in a sad pretence that he was popular too . Other students took up the oft-reiterated call , shouted it back and forth , and finally it became a byword for Harvard men  --  like the " Hello Bill " of the Elks , but more high-toned. wrong . lowed hack and forth from a score or two throats . The next night the cry was taken up again , and on the next night , and thereafter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably always will be . " 0 Rinehart " was heard much at the Paris Exposition shortly after it was first sounded in Cam bridge . No one seems to know the student who first called " 0 Rinehart , " and few know about Rinehart himself It seems , however , that after graduation he began the practice of law in New York , becoming interested in politics . In 1916 he was sued for a large amount by an elderly woman who declared he had misused securities she had turned over to him . In connection with this he spent a short while in jail . Afterward , he tried to reenter politics , but unsuccessfully . When the war started he joined the army , being stationed in Georgia , where he was judge advocate of his outfit . He has been seen little in New York since the war and is presumed to live now at a small town in Pennsylvania , his birthplace . He is : about fifty-five . Procedure JUST to show you how girls get glorified . A young lady , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little surprised to have a uniformed chauffeur greet her with the information that a gentleman whose car was at the curb would like to speak to her . She approached . The gentleman leaned forward . " Have you ever been in a show ? " he asked . She said no . " Would you like to ? " She said yes . " Please report to my office tomorrow at ten , " said the gentleman , handing her his card . He leaned back in his scat , signalled to the driver ; the car moved off . Still a little dazed , the girl looked at the card : Earl Carroll . All imal Voices WHEN the noon whistle blows in Bronx Zoo , it starts the wolves howling . They point their noses high , their breath curls upward on the cold air , and they give tongue in the primeval forests of their cage . Movie people have been trying to record this performance in sound pictures , but without any luck  --  the wolves refuse to howl into a microphone . It 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Animals are rather hard to take in sound pictures , Dr. Ditmars , the snake man , tells us . He has been making sound records of their voices for synchronization with his own moving pie tures , and has recorded the sounds of most of the animals in the Park . Lions are disappointing  --  they sound like a cow , no majesty , only vaguely sad . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer made a sound record , for its trademark lion , but gave it up , it sounded so feeble and un-metrogoldwyn-mayer . Camels are difficult , and better results are obtained by having a man make a noise like a camel than by taking the camel 's voice itself . Strangely enough , one of the best sound artists is the rattlesnake  --  the sound record of a rattler is perfect . Dr. Ditmars experimented with a wooden rattle in front of the microphone , but could get nothing as good as the real thing . The hiss of the cobra is also rather nice . A major difficulty is getting the animal to make any sound at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are different ways of stimulating them . To make a monkey scream with horror , you show it a live snake . To make it chatter with glee , you show it a banana . Tree toads wo n't perform until you begin sawing up a piece of bronze with a hacksaw  --  and that spoils the record . Dr. Ditmars wanted to make a katydid record and found that the only way he could induce the katydids to make their monotonous music was by placing other katydids on the outside of his studio , so that his subjects could hear the low distant sound of the ir love-making . This required a lot of katydids , and necessitated a trip to Wurtsborough Mountain in jersey , where katydids can be captured at night in the scrub oaks on the mountainside . According to Dr. Ditmars , the cleanest and most satisfactory way to record animal sounds is to stay away from the animals altogether , and summon a man named Phil Dwyer , who will make any noise you ask for , and who does n't require any stimulus such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camel in a fine camel picture made by one of the movie companies . It would have been a great success as a topical picture except that in making up the film they put the camel voice ( a mournful and very loud braying- noise ) on a kangaroo record . The result was surprising , zoologically , but the braying kangaroo appeared in two Broadway houses before the film company discovered its mistake . Natural history note : kangaroos do not make any noise . Shopping Scenes WE ca n't be every- where at once , and so we missed out on the biggest flurry of the year in Cartier 's last week . A young Cuban , who has just come here to live , went on his first shopping tour , saw watches in the windows of the famous jewelry store , went in , and asked for an alarm clock . An amazed clerk took the matter up with the shocked clock department , which said if the Cuban would wait fifteen minutes they would do some figuring and give him an estimate on an alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cuban are still pretty much upset . Another big merchandising event of the past week came when a young couple from out of town , who have just settled down in the East Nineties , went to Sloane 's to buy some chintz curtains . They gave the clerk who waited on them the exact amount of the purchase in cash . He stood staring at the money . " What 's wrong ? " asked the husband . " Well , sir , " said the clerk at last , " I 've worked here many years , but I never made a cash sale before and I  --  I scarcely know what to do with the money . " The Three Chesters NOT one but three men are re-sponsible for those mechanical golf and soccer games you may have seen here and there around the town lately , in hotel lobbies , railway stations , and club smoking-rooms . The golf game is especially popular . It is enclosed in a large glass box . You push various levers outside , and a little castiron golfer inside swings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hole , more or less as you happen to have aimed . The soccer game takes two to play . The opponents punch levers and in response to these impulses the two teams kick the ball around until finally it lands in one or the other 's goal . Then they drop in another nickel and start over again . The three men who invented the games are Frank , Charles , and Ernest Chester , three brothers , and they are now hard at work on two new ideas . One is a mechanical baseball game , a nickel an inning , the other an indoor golf game , for the home . It will have a course about as big as a billiard table , and all sorts of things will happen when the levers are pushed . The three Chestees are very proud of it , partly on moral grounds : they think hits of men will stay home and play golf with the whole family instead of running off alone to the country club . The brothers were born in Australia , where their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . The three boys sang operas until they got too old for it ; then they came to New York and almost immediately began building strange and startling mechanical devices for melodramas  --  sinking ships , horse-race illusions , andso on . From this they turned to inventing games , although they still occasionally construct scenic effects . Recently they built for Abraham &; Straus a kind of large mechanical vision of what Brooklyn will look like in sixty years . D irigi hits sailed through the sky ; automobiles , model 1990 , scooted along the streets . The only thing that really puzzled the Chesters was whether , sixty years hence , women shoppers would be wearing long or short skirts . Finally , they begged the question by putting all the ladies in motor cars , where their skirts would n't show . The trio do all their designing and building in their factory in West Fuurth Street . The firm is named the Chester Pollard Amusement Company . Pollard was the name of the Australian opera company and was included out of sentiment . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesdays they go to prizefights ; Fridays they go to a show . All three are married , and the three . families all live in the same apartment house , up in Washington Heights . People are always suggesting things for them to invent , most of them ridiculous . One man had an idea fur a machine which would brush you an over in an instant , at the turn of a lever , but the Chester 's decided it would just frighten anyone who tried it . Someone else proposed an automatic manicure and finger-nail polisher for barbershops . The brothers turned that down too , concluding that men would n't be interested in having their nails done by machinery . Slightly Cut A LOCAL savant who has been lecturing in Mississippi returns with news of the bootleg situation there . As to liquor , it 's about the same as here , but it also extends to books . He de-cided he would bring back , as a sou-venir , a textbook on biology from which had been cut , in compliance with state law , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one which sells frequent ! ) , to students at the state university , and bought one . He was about to depart with his purchase when the proprietor winked at him broadly , and then , by various motionings , in-vited him to slip into a back room . After the two had entered , the book-seller shut the door , listened a moment , and then handed his customer a scaled envelope . Upon being opened later this was found to contain the missing pages .
