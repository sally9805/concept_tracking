txt Unreconcilable I have just read your editorial " Mr. Roosevelt 's New Duties " with the utmost amazement . If the American people did n't vote for the continuance and logical conclusion of Mr. Roosevelt 's policies , why did they vote for him ? Your hypothesis that they do n't intend him to carry on his present program is absurd . Nor can I understand why , after supporting him so loyally , you now about face and want him to change . As for myself , I have always been told that one must not marry a man to reform him . Invariably the confirmed drunk reels home some night to crack down on his infatuated wife 's head . You liked Mr. Roosevelt the way he was and you got him . Stand by your previous convictions . The " Master " rewards his faithful so generously . Me , I 'm going to keep right on being a Republican  --  that is , if I can get police protection . If I ca n't , I think one meets a better type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
