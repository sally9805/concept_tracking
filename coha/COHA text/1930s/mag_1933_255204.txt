EVELYN PRENTICE-W . E. Woodward- Knopf ( $2.25 ) . <P> Author Woodward says , &"The; writing of novels is a form of human activity that requires neither knowledge nor experience and only a small amount of native talent , for its successful accomplishment . &"; It is not surprising , therefore , that his own novels are not very good . But in spite of its author 's cynical bluster and insensitive awkwardness , Evelyn Prentice slowly pulls itself together into a ponderous but dramatic tale . <P> Evelyn , beautiful , half-Spanish artist 's daughter , was comfortably married . She had two children , a luxurious Manhattan house , a nice place in the country , plenty of spending-money from her elderly lawyer husband , John , and a poverty-stricken youth to look back on . She had even inherited a certain amount of talent from her father . But the poor thing was bored . Her husband bored her , and her husband 's friends . When Larry Kennard ( n Swenson ) , a Greenwich Village literary racketeer and professional ladies ' man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was thrilled . Author Woodward makes Larry a far-from-attractive specimen , tacitly defends himself by intimating that women 's tastes are unaccountable . Some of Larry 's more honeyed speeches : " Say , dear , give me your coat . . . . Please rise a moment , will you , dear ? . . . You golden-voiced gal . . . . How about a little loving ? " Evelyn thought he was just irresistible , yielded herself with hardly a struggle . It was not long , however , before she discovered he was a bad number . When he threatened blackmail she shot him . Another woman was arrested . Evelyn got Husband John to take the case ; he got the woman off . Evelyn , no longer bored , appreciated her blessings more than ever .
