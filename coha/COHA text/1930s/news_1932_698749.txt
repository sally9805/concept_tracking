txt The ! House tonight was prepared for one lof the most bitter debates of the session in anticipation of the introduction tomorrow of a special rule which , if adopted by a majority vote , will automatically attach the Economy Committee omnibus bill to the legislative appropriation bill . Opponents were declaring they had sufficient strength to defeat adoption of the rule , while members of the committee and other leaders adt mitted that a " very close " vote was expected . . If the House refused to accept the Rules Committee resolution , they said , the huge omnibus bill , which is estimated to result in savings of more than $200,000,000 , would be practically wrecked . Opposition to the bill is attributable chiefly to the committee plan to reduce all Federal salaries 11 per cent , with the first $1,000 exempted . The opposition was being mustered into voting strength tonight by Representative La Guardia , Representative Cochran , a member of the Economy Committee ; Representative Connery and a group of Western Representatives who object to more than one section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the day with Senator Glass , who visited the House chamber , and later in the day held an important conference with Senator Robinson in the Senate cloakroom . The latter conversation stirred rumors that the Speaker was worried over parliamen- tary " strategy " in getting the omnibus bill through the House . " I was lust tired and wanted to take a walk , " Mr. Garner explained . , " so I went over to the cloakroom and I happened to meet Senator Robinson . There were about fifteen others who took part in the discussion , which was about nothing in particular . " President Hoover 's modified plan for a staggered furlough system instead of pay cuts , a reduction of pay for members of Congress . and other plans which the committee refused to incorporate in the bill , was reprinted today . The staggered furlough plan is calculated to save $83,000,000 . The committee agreed to allow Representative Ramseyer. minority member , to offer this modified plan as a substitute for the pay cut . The draft also contains the President 's proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles , estimated to ' save $17,500,000 . The committee de1 cided that the plan was " too dangerous " for the Democrats to sponsor . Hoover Plan Sets $110,000,000 Saving . The President 's Nrogram , in addition to the furlough plan and the rural mail carrier allowance , would suspend for a year all leaves of absence . The total saving under the entire plan , the committee revealed , was $110,500,000 . To this was added a 10 per cent reduction for members of Congress , an 81-3 per cent reduction for all legislative branch employes , a reduction of retired pay and a permanent reduction of salaries of officers of the International Joint Commission , the Federal Farm Board and the United States Shipping Board , the maximum to be $10,000 . The plan also provides for voluntary remittances to the Treasury by any officers not affected by the bill . Chairman , in view of the revised administration plan , estimated the saving of the omnibus bill at $200,000,000 . This included only $50,000,000 for savings in the consolidation of the War and Navy Departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000,000 . The outstanding development in the situation today was the charge of Representative Clancy of Michigan that the section of the bill directing the Secretary of War to dispose of property used in connection with the army transport service was a " vicious joker . " Clancy Charges " Steal . " He said it offered the way for one of the biggest " steals " in history . " I can not say it on the floor until tomorrow , " . he said , " but I will certainly call it to the attention of the House then . " The section to which he referred read as follows : " The Secretary of War ' - is authorized and directed to discontinue the army transport service . He shall transfer the sea-going vessels used in such service to the United States Shipping Board . The Secretary of War shall dispose of as much of the property of the United States ( other than vessels ) used in connection with such service as is not indispensable for other uses of the army or the War Department , and shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations of the United States growing out of such service existing at the time of such discontinuance . " Thereafter no part of appropriations heretofore or hereafter made shall be available for the continuance of such service , and appropriations and unexpended balances of appro-1 priations the expenditure of which is made unnecessary by this section i shall not be expended but shall be impounded and returned to the Treas " National Disgrace " Seen . " This section , " said Mr. Clancy , " arbitrarily directs the Secretary to sell this property , and it includes four piers in Brooklyn worth at least $60,000,000 . There are three others in San Francisco , two at Boston and one each at Manila and Honolulu . If these are thrown on the market at ' panicky ' prices it will be a national disgrace and it will develop into one of the greatest scandals in history . " Mr. Clancy said he had been in communication with the War Department and that Assistant Secretary Payne agreed with him . He said he would read letters from Mr. Payne condemning the provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York offered an amendment to the legislative bill today to reduce the salary of members of Congress to $7,500 . It was deferred until tomorrow . " There are/so many jokers in the omnibus bill it is likely to be defeated , " Mr. Bacon sjtid . " I have been studying the sections relating to the postal workers . I find in many cases , because of these joker insertions , that the little fellows in the postal service will be cut more than 50 per cent . " If thejEconomy Committee plans to cut them in half , it is nothing but fair that Senators and Representatives also be reduced . My amendment reduces such salaries to where they were on March 4 , 1925 . " Legislative Bill Completed . The House completed the legislative bill today except for the final section , which was left open in the expectation that the omnibus bill would be added tomorrow . No amendments were adopted . Two groups will meet in conference early tomorrow before the House convenes . In one will be Representa- , tive Cochran , Representative Connery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will vote against adoption of the rule rather than approve the committee pay-cut plans . Representative O'Connor of New York has a " gentleman 's agreement " with Representative Warren of North Carolina , who will preside during debate on the bill ,  --  and will offer an amendment to exempt all salaries below $2,000 . This would reduce the ' committee 's pay-cut estimate of $67 , - 302,000 to $18,332,000 , Mr. estimated . While this group is in conference , Representative Ramseyer and other Republican leaders will meet to attempt to revise the Rules Committee resolution limiting amendments to four for each of the ten titles in the bill . t " There are many who feel that it is not fair to allow only members of the Economy Committee to offer amendments , " Mr. Ramseyer said , " and it is a very strict rule . Of course , I do n't believe the bill should be thrown wide open to amendments from every source . That would require weeks to finish the bill . If the rule is liberalized some I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eight Men Hold Power . If the rule is adopted by the House *id the bill presented for debate , eight men will virtually carry it through to a final vote . The seven members of the Economy Committee , according to House rules , who will be " privileged " are Chairman and Representative Wood or Mr. Ramseyer , the ranking Republican members ; Representatives Byrne , Cochr. n , Douglas and Williamson , the latter a Republican . Mr. Warren , who will preside , will not be expected to recognize other members , and it will be entirely within his own discretion which member of the Economy Committee he will recognize . Representative Vinson of Georgia , chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee , notified the opposition leadership today that he and several other Georgia Representatives would oppose the special rule . Representative Swing of California is another who will join the opponents . Members of the Economy Committee , who have virtually been out of touch with sentiment in the House for the last several weeks , lounged in the cloakroom and lobby of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get a line on the feeling for or against the bill over which they have labored for so many weeks . Mr. prepared a table ' showing the amounts that would be saved by varying exemptions of salaries of $1,000 , $1,500 and $2,000 . The table , which follows , will be used in offering any amendments to change the present plan of exempting $1,000 of all salaries : Reduction Exemption Per Cent . $1,000. $1,500. $2,000. 5 530,592,000 $17,845,000 $8,333,000 6 36,710,000 21,415,000 9,999,000 7 42,829,000 24,984,000 11,666,000 8 48,947,000 28,553,000 13,332,000 9 5,065,000 32,122,000 14,999.000 10 61,114,000 35,691,000 16,665,000 11 67,30Z000 39,260,000 18,332,000 12 ? .. 73,420,000 42.829,000 19,998,000 13 79,539,000 46,398.000 21.665,000 14 ? ? ? 85,657,000 49,967,000 23,331,000 15 91,775,000 53,536,000 24,998,000
