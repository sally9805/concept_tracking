THE CITADEL-A . J. Cronin-Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> Amid the squalor and duress of Britain 's most " depressed area " ( the South Wales mining district ) a brilliant young physician , Andrew Manson , took his first medi-cal appointment . He scorned the mumbo-jumbo of outworn textbooks , went to the unprofessional lengths of helping dynamite a sewer at dead of night because he knew it responsible for a typhoid epidemic . Again &; again in his crusading zeal " never to take anything for granted ' ' in Medicine he was thwarted by the indifference of senile or mediocre colleagues . An original thesis on the causes of lung infection in miners won him a government appointment . He was again disillusioned . Instead of finding himself with opportunities to pursue his research , he was given six months in which to decide whether a two-and-a-half inch bandage is better than a three-inch . With his last 600 he bought a down- &-out; practice in London , found after months of struggle that he had a charming bedside manner , settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End by flattery , worthless capsules , clothes made in Conduit Street . <P> Aimed at the whole precept-and-practice of the British medical profession , The , Citadel is a brilliantly bitter attack by a man in dead earnest . Says Author Cronin : The small-town English G. P. ( general practitioner ) who does everything from confinements to corn-cutting has no time , soon no desire , to keep up-to-date . The medical bigwigs are smothered in red tape . Worst of all , perhaps , are the specialists- typified by the word " Harley Street " - who exploit the rich , scratch one another 's backs to their mutual profit , in some cases make fortunes on the side by performing hush-hush abortions for careless socialites . <P> The Author can not be dismissed as an intemperate tyro . A doctor himself , his writing , until July 1930 , was confined to medical subjects ( Dust-Inhalation by Haematite Miners , First Aid in Coal Mines ) ; he has practiced in South Wales , has been down more than 500 coal mines . His first novel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gloomy lengthy melodrama , was a surprise best seller . In neither of his professions has Dr. Cronin paid much attention to the rules . To the lay reader the " cut-shop " ( medical jargon ) in The Citadel may seem tedious and overdone : but to many The Citadel will appeal as a spunky onslaught on an unco-sacrosanct stronghold . For " the bogus orf Harley-street " Dr. Cronin reserves his heaviest guns . Writing in London 's Daily Express after the book 's publication in Britain , he thundered : " I say to you , in all seriousness , that if half of this famous thoroughfare were bombed out of existence tomorrow , medicine , indeed all of us . . would be better off .
