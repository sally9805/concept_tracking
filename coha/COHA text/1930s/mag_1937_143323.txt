To the plain-garbed , plain-spoken Mennonites and Amishmen of Pennsylvania , the New Deal has meant a far from abundant life . Because the Amish churches frown upon written contracts , loans , gifts and joining secular organizations , the " plain people " declined to sign contracts with the AAA , or accept its benefits , although they were willing to reduce acre : age where the law required . Mennonites in industry pay Social Security taxes , but declare they will not accept Social Security pensions . Nor will they join labor unions , although they meekly allow union dues to be " checked off " their wages . <P> Last year Amishmen and Mennonites of East Lampeter Township , Pa. petitioned the Government not to grant $56,200 of PWA money to their school board for a consolidated school . Their petition failing and the school completed , the Mennonites were about to defy the law and keep their children at home last month , when Pennsylvania 's liberal Governor George Howard Earle came to the rescue . He ordered that they be permitted to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to . In gratitude last week 500 Mennonites and Amishmen of East Lampeter voted to give Governor Earle a turkey , a jug of cider , a pumpkin and some corn , every Christmas as long as he lives .
