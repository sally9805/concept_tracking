Japanese light bulb manufacturers , gazing thoughtfully at the news from Germany last week , organized the first anti-Semitic mass meeting that Tokyo correspondents could remember . <P> In 1931 International General Electric Co. ' s Mazda lamp patents expired in Japan . Japanese manufacturers jumped at the chance , flooded not only their own country with cheap bulbs but in 1932 dumped 113,000,000 Japanese light bulbs , selling at 5 and 10 , in the U. S. International General Electric of Japan , a U. S. subsidiary , applied immediately for new patents . Word leaked from the Japanese patent office last week that it would probably be granted . Hence the mass meeting . Though there are probably not 1,000 Jews in all Japan , 2,500 solemn-spectacled Japanese trooped to a hall , heard a retired General deliver a Jew-baiting address in the best Nazi manner , and joined in a rousing song . Its chorus : Oh , punish the Jewish people- defeat the General Electric , and Break the Mazda lamp !             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
