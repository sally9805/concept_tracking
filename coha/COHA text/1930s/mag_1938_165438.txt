Honeyman ( Ore . ) , Virginia E. Jenckes ( Ind. ) - lined up chain-gang fashion for a group photograph ( see cut ) . They had gathered to honor the prize winner of a contest conducted by the Women 's Division of the Democratic National Committee . <P> Last week , all six members separately told the press that they liked their jobs and planned to keep them if they could . All are up for re-election this year .
