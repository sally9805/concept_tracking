 | name like that ! I 've never , thank God , needed to reckon with her closely until this evening ; but I 've got wits enough to be grateful Lord Sleugh did n't elect to bring home a wife from Africa who was the daughter of a Zulu chief or something like that  --  tattooed and with a ring in her nose . For if he had " ? she raised one eyebrow sharply , released her monocle , and put her knitting down with emphasis ? " I would still have invited her here to dinner this evening , nose-ring and all . So keep that in mind . " Derek stuffed tobacco into his pipe and held it down with his thumb . 1 le did not intend to get into any argument with his Aunt  --  not just now , at least . " Besides , " she went on , " you know as well as I do that if it had n't been for Sleugh and all he did tirelessly to keep your brother 's name clean of that miserable Marakoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging around .

" Oh , my dear Her face had suddenly an expression of sorrow and fatigue , which always came there when Frank Merrington was mentioned . Frank had always been openly her favourite . Since news of his tragic death in Africa , two months before , nothing for her would ever be quite the same . Yet nothing had marred , or probably would mar , the fine air of power and determination that so definitely characterized her . " My advice to you , Derck , " she said , with finality , " is to take your medicine like a man . " " Oh , I thay ! " The Honourable Tony Ogle , who had been investigat-  | ng Stillwell on Fly-fishing in the library , entered the room , followed by Cranbrook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford with Derek for the holidays . " Thtrange thing , " pursued the Honourable Tony , addressing Derek , " but Thtillwell doeth n't tell a fellow tho mutth about fith as you 'd thuthpect he would . It'th my cxperienth . " He caught sight of Aunt Leila . " Oh , Mith Merrington ! " He bowed over her hand . " Tho good of you to let me thtay thith evening . You 're thure I wo n't be de trop ? " " No , indeed ! Glad to have you , Tony ! " She turned to young Kenton . " You are to meet an extraordinarily beautiful woman tonight , my young Indian . " She looked with a kind of cordial affection at him . She liked his six-foot-three of height , his slender , easy , rather loose-jointed body , his firm jaw and chin , and a wise , quiet way the rather narrow eyes had of seeming to see everything with their occasional glances from side to side . " I hope , " said Kenton , looking down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for me . " " Well , she would n't if she liked Indians as well as I do , " said Aunt Leila , brusquely gracious . " That'th very interesting , Mith Merrington , " said Tony , " your calling Kenton Indian . ' I heard a chap thay the other day , that that'th the lateth theory .

" llc turned happily to another subject . " It will therm like old timeth , wo n't it , to thee Lord Thleugh again ? " " Yes , " said Aunt Leila . " I 've already seen him , of course .

" " Oh , Mith Merrington ! " Tony bent over , laughing . " That'th very amuthing ! Cranbrook and the Topath Cat ' ! " " When you are as old as I am " ? Miss Merrington took up her knitting again ? " you will have learned to take the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeth , I thuppoth tho . Right you are , of courthe . " A little later , greetings were under way . " We 're all delighted to have you here , " said Aunt Leila to Lady Sleugh . " This is Derek . He 's been wanting very much to meet you . . . . Bob Kenton " ? she laid an affectionate hand on him ? " is from America  --  Rhodes scholar . They do n't do any studying , you know . He got the scholarship because he 's six-foot-three . And here is Tony . " Tony bent over Lady Sleugh 's hand , looking eagerly and delightedly into the beautiful , rather languid , topaz eyes . " Oh , I thay ! Ith n't thith jutht too topping to thee you again ! " A few moments later still , Aunt Leila , at the head of the dinner table , was taking the world as she found it . The beauty of Dornia Eleutherios  --  Lady Sleugh  --  the perfect oval of her face , the unusual , bronzy-yellow eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abundant hair , the magnolia-like creaminess of her skin  --  suggested something of the beauty of an exotic flower . But most of all , perhaps , this was suggested by that delicate melancholy sometimes found in the faces of those still young , who have lived too long for the span of their years , and who have been too markedly beautiful in a world not altogether lovely . Lady Sleugh 's extraordinary beauty stood out now , not  | only against the homelike surroundings of Cranbrook House , but strikingly against the severity and stone-greyness of Sleugh , as a flower stands out against a rock . Sleugh was tall ; he had stone-grey hair , finely cut features , and square shoulders . I Lis dignity , power , and prestige had given Dornia Eleutherios , for the first time in her life , security and unquestioned shelter . " Madame est abritcc ! " the old Duchess of Moon had said , watching them hatefully through her lorgnon at their first appearance in public after their marriage . Sleugh on his part , found a pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose as a wife , to a society which , however it might criticise Dornia Elcutherios and her former somewhat tragic connection with Marakoff , would be bound  --  say obliged  --  to accept her without question as I.ady Slough . The talk turned inevitably to Africa , to Joan and to Shackleton 's expedition . " Well , I hope Ned Nvill get his wretched Yellow Ape quickly , " said Aunt Leila , " and come home and let me have a peaceful night 's sleep without a nightmare . Lord knows what he 'll do with it . " " Oh , " said Tony , " he 'll thtulT it , of courthe , and it will be put in the Mutheum , and we 'll all go there to thee it , and thay , Why , howdy do , old ' l'op ! Charmed to meet you ! ' ? That'th to thay if it'th thtufled . Could n't , of courthe , if it wath n't . " " Africa does n't mean a thing to me , " Miss Mcrrington cut in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " amended Derek . " Yes , Bimbi . Think , my dear "  --  - she turned to Lady Sleugh ? " of having Bimbi to wait upon us for years , and then to have him make off as he did , in a hare-brained manner , after a pack of young people  --  to Africa . Oh ,  | I 've had my difficulties ! These are some of the disciplines of the older years  --  to have plenty of sense yourself , and to have to deal with enthusiastic young people who have n't a particle . " There was the laughter of the others . " And that is why , " said Lord Sleugh , bending gravely to her , " you sometimes tell me I 'm a comfort . I 'm not to young and enthusiastic . " " My dear , I could n't get on without you , " she said . " I 've lived and endured Joan 's absence just to have you come back from that hideous place and tell me I 'm right , and that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin-lipped smile . " No , I do n't believe I could honestly say that . Ned Shackleton and Joan are supremely happy , and a finer fellow than Ned " " I know , I know ! " Miss Merrington dropped her monocle savagely and dipped her spoon into her soup . " Romance ! Adventure ! All that ! But Africa , for me , is synonymous with swamps and fevers and natives and tom-toms . " " Oh , Mith Merrington , " offered the Honourable Tony , " there'th peckth bethideth . There'th pith helmetth , for example . Wearing a pith helmet ith jutht like carrying a light pagoda on your head that you did n't know wath there . And there'th a thplendid wine they make out of pink blothomth " " ' I hat 's true , Tony . You 've been to Africa , have n't you ? " said Derek . Derek felt a devilish pleasure in leading Tony on to talk of Africa . For , had n't Dornia Eleutherios lived there some years before , with Marakoff ? And was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 's request , soon after 1 I:u akoff was murdered ? And was n't it possible , perhaps ,  | to make that pale skin of hers grow a little less pale ? That would n't be a bad shy at Dobby , either ! " Oh , Africa ith a rip-topping plathe , " said Tony . Lady Sleugh turned to him . " Where was it you stopped in Africa ? " she said . Her voice was even and disinterested . " The minx ! " thought Derek , piqued by her coolness . It was Tony who was a bit abashed and confused . He looked around eagerly , as though not only Lady Sleugh , but everyone , had asked him the question . " I thtayed at Yoko , " he said . " Beautiful plathe , on the Thanaga . There are theme Anglican priethtth there . It'th a Mithion . Met a very interethting lady there  --  from your country " ? he made a slight , deferential cluck at Kenton across the table ? " Mith Mary I.angdon . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have mentioned Mary I.angdon ! That shaved too close to the Marakoff affair . 1lc looked around as in a bog one looks for a tussock . " Beautiful name the Mithion had , " he started out brightly , choosing that one . " ' I'haint II unrinata . " " There ! " said Miss Leila , leaning back in her chair with satisfaction . " " That 's the name of the place where Joan and Ned were married . I could n't make it out . Joan 's handwriting is fright ful . " " Do n't you remember , " Lord Sleugh said , " It was from that Mission that Shackleton got . his natives for his expedition  --  Christianized natives . Of course , for a man of honour like Shackleton " Miss Merrington waved it away with an irritated fan . " Oh , honour ! Honour ! ? I do n't know what anyone wants of it , in Africa ! The great need , as I see it , would be legs to get away ! " " Honestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing a little lazily into the conversation , " Africa is n't such a bad place . It really is n't . " " Lord ! So you 've been there , too ! " Miss Merrington stopped agitating her small fan , put her monocle carefully in place , raised her head , and looked at him as at an anomaly . " Yes . It 's really not so bad . I went chiefly for the long sea trip . To make it as long as I could , I came back on a tramper . Africa 's A-one for size , " said Kenton . " That 's what impresses you most . Everything on such a huge scale . Of course it has its horrors , but I did n't see many of them . I saw one man who had seen them , though . At least , he had seen something horrible , and I always thought it must have been in Africa . It was a strange case . His name was Marsten  --  a great big six-footer . Used to be half-back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medals , and the Congressional Medal for distinguished bravery ; yet there he was , a man literally cowed , haunted , by some terror he could n't or would n't explain . I knew the little French doctor who attended him for a while . Marsten never would tell him anything . Something to do with apes , I understand . But nobody could ever find out what . " " By gad ! " said Tony , sympathetically , " that'th interethting ! He wath probably attacked by them . " " Probably , " said Derek . " Well , I 've alwayth thaid , " said Tony , brightly , " that if I ever went exploring in Africa , I would n't take all thoth rifleth and elephant gunth that motht people take . I 'd take a good-thithe green or red umbrella to thurprithe the animalth with . It'th my experienth that thurprithing them ith a very great defenth . You thee , animalth alwayth thtop when they are thurprithed . Ath they come toward you , you would open and thut it very rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quick gestures of rapidly opening and closing an umbrella . Everyone laughed . Derek roared . " By gad ! You 've hit it , Tony ! That 's the method ! " When the laughter had died down , Kenton said , still smiling : " I doubt if even that would take care of the monkey tribe . They 're unholy cunning creatures . There was an amusing one coming home on the Bonnie Bess . That was the name of the tramper . She was n't bonnie . But I would n't have missed her , and her second mate , and her monkey . They had a great time of it . It ended by the monkey nearly giving the mate apoplexy , and for his pains getting thrown into the sea , poor little devil . " " Drowned , you mean ? What had he done ? " Derek liked to get at the bottom of everything . " He stole something from the mate and hid it , " said Kenton . " There was the devil to pay . The man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some one here in London paid him well to bring out from Africa each year a certain single African fruit , as big as my two fists . I saw it myself  --  a gorgeous thing  --  a pomegranate . " As he spoke the last words Lady Slough 's fingers , resting idly on her glass , tightened tensely around its stem . The rest were too interested in Kenton 's story to notice ; but Lord Sleugh , from the other side of the table , sent his glance slanting to her fingers and let it rest there a long moment . The rest of the story was quickly told . The pomegranate served , Kenton supposed , as a symbol or sign of something of vast importance to the person who finally received it . He had the impression that Carstensen had no immediate interest in it , save a heavy fee , not to be paid unless the fruit was forthcoming .  | Nile Kenton spoke , the Earl of Sleugh watching his s hand , was aware , too , of the hurried rising and fallof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fa ( e. *You do n't happen to know who the consignee was ?

A famous psychologist here in London . You rememI Icy was mysteriously murdered here some months ? , Lived in Smith Square . I remember that . " Ile paused , trying still to recall the name . No one offered it to him . At that moment , Lady Sleugh 's hand , so tense on the - glass , relaxed completely . Derek saw , though he not looking directly at her . The Earl of Sleugh put hand to the back of his chair , as though he were about rise . But he did not . Derek , secretly watchful , under ? ncommittal , dark brows , saw Lady Sleugh 's eyelids ? roop down almost against her intense pallor . He pushed r wine-glass a trifle closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Do drink a little . " There was an awkward silence . Tony looked about for is cause . Kenton was still looking into his plate , trying to remember . It was hardly an instant before the long lashes were raised again and Lady Sleugh had recovered herself . " That was odd , " she said , a little dreamily , but with her usual poise and with a smile . " Are n't we strangely made ? I remember that happening once before in the Caspian Sea  --  that exact same sensation of drowning . The captain said ) ) " Excuse me , " said Derek , " but I think this room is  | devilishly warm . " He spoke to the butler at his elbow . " Let us have a bit of air , Barnsten . " Lady Sleugh now turned to Kenton , next her , and gave him a smile . " You were trying to remember a name , " she said , gently putting her hand on the table beside him . " The name you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Derek 's glance . His eyes paid her open tribute . By Jove ! She was a sport , after all , was n't she ? Yes . By gad ! she was plucky ! There 's something about pluckiness in a woman " Let us go into the drawing-room and have coffee , " said Aunt Leila , rising and leading the way . Later , driving back to Greymoor , Lord Sleugh took his wife 's hand and , carrying it to his lips , let them rest against it . Everything he had  --  his dignity , his power , his protection  --  was at her command ; yet never by so much as a glance had she as yet admitted her need of them . He believed that some day that glance or appeal would come . The merest pressure of her fingers on his now would have been enough to set his heart swinging . Ile would have taken her against his breast protectingly , passionately . What was it that a little while ago had troubled her ? Not the name of Marakoff. lle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too often to suppose that any mention of Marakoff could disturb her . And what dread could she have of the mate of a dirty tramp steamer bringing home tribute to Marakoff ? No . Some other memory  --  but what ? " When you have need of me , " Sleugh murmured against her hand , " you will not forget how entirely I am yours . "  | " No , mon ami ! " put her other hand over his , with a little warm ure of her fingers . But it was not the appealing presSlcugh had hoped for ; a reassuring one , rather . You are good to me , " she murmured . " Always so to me. " hcy rode on in silence , in the darkness of the softly ' ng motor .

It opened into the eastern will of the Valley at a little height from the base of the cliffs . Once within the entrance the cavern widened to nearly twenty feet , and so continued for twice that distance . There it narrowed . Beyond this narrow place was a second chamber . At the rear of this some crevice in the rock formed a natural vent . The clean air of the Valley was drawn through the two chambers , making them dry and fresh . The inner chamber would be their sleeping-quarters . In the outer one Bimbi had arranged the folding canvas chairs and tables . Ile had spread rugs and skins on the floor . Meanwhile , Shackleton superintended the building of the natives ' camp on the low ground below and at a little distance from the cave and not far from the spring .

" One ca n't expect them to grow up irom savagery to adult civilization in a single lifetime . " " In other words , " Shackleton suggested , " there are points on which Christianity and savagery have to compromise . " lather Hilary smiled faintly . But immediately the smile was succeeded by a little troubled frown . " ' There are those , I know , " he said , slowly , and his fingers strayed to the cross he wore on a black cord about his neck , " who , if they knew all , would think it strange ? perhaps even sinful  --  that I , a Christian priest , not only do not forbid some of the native festivals , but have even tried to make use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance . " But Shackleton was thinking of something else . " I am wondering , " he said , " whether even these Christianized men will be able to endure the sight of the Yellow Ape without revolt . After all , their fathers have worshipped the Yellow Ape as a god . " Father Hilary cut him short : " I will speak to them about it before you start , " he said . " I will explain . I will make a point of it . Then it will be a matter of pride for them . No . I think you need have no fear on that score . " Shackleton sensed a sort of pride in his voice . I Ie was thinking of this now as he looked at the men . holak and Bartu , his two gorilla-hunters . They were Bantus , quick , hard , intelligent , alert . Bartu especially .  | Both spoke fairly good English , picked up at the Mission and in the service of English hunting parties in this region .

Father llilary had said his father had been a medicine-mart . Then there was Tongo . Tongo was one of Father Hilary 's " boys . " " A model servant , " lather I lilary had said of him . " Trustworthy to a fault . " Tongo , too , would be useful . Now he was puffed with new pride and importance .

I may be called at any time . If so , I wo n't waken you . If you wake and find me gone , do n't be alarmed . "  | $o the call had come . Was it really the Ape ? The exmeat of t hat thought quickened her pulses . She wished ? ent ly t hat he had roused her , or that she had wakened he rself in time to share that moment with him .

She saw him rise , go and return , and drop a little mile of fresh twigs on the embers . The glow died for moment , then flared again as a circle of new flames kcd round the fresh fuel . A moment later a faint aroma- , perfume , like the scent of crushed chrysanthemum leaves , was wafted into the cave . 1 low romantic it all was ! The night  --  the watchfiree watchman  --  and beyond these the unknown . The scent of the fire smoke made her deliciously drowsy . She was preparing to go to sleep again when she became aware that something was moving in the outer chamber of the cave . Could it be Ned returning ? The firelight flared suddenly on the curving wall of the cave opposite to her . Sharply silhouetted against that glow appeared a shadow . It loomed monstrous and vaguely terrible , something that was neither man nor beast . Joan felt herself gripped by an icy horror . She could not scream . She could only crouch there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as the wall straightened , the shadow suddenly assumed shape , the terror took form  --  the form of a young girl . Rounded limbs moved beneath some fluttering drapery . Long hair floated away from the shoulders . The girl 's head , turned slightly , was still formless and indistinct . I lad some slight sound startled the shadow ? The head went back . Against the rock the face appeared a moment  | in profile . Joan had a glimpse of delicate aquiline features , the line of a proud chin . Then the shadow girl stooped swiftly ; she laid something on a shelf of the rock and was gone . What had happened ? Who had been there ? What could be the meaning of that shadow figure ? Joan did not know how long she remained as in a spell of bewilderment before quick steps sounded on the rock before the cave . She heard Shackleton 's voice , full of sharp reprimand : " Tongo ! What 's this ? Does a watchman sleep ? " Then Tongo 's voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep ; something came  --  a spirit .

" You are sure it was the Ape ? " " I am sure ; it was the Yellow One . " " Ah ! " " It will come again , " Bartu reassured him . " It had not yet drunk . Your coming disturbed it . Wait .

The shadow girl  --  who , what manner of creature could she be ? And what had brought her to the cave ? Was it merely to leave the opal ? I lis fingers felt for the jewel in his shirt pocket .

His own flesh began to creep unpleasantly . That dreadful , inhuman chorus seemed to carry all the threat of the beast world . Shackleton moved slightly , conscious of his cramped and aching muscles . Bartu laid a hand warningly on his knee . " Look , 0 He-Who-Sees-Everything . It comes . " Shackleton bent and peered . The quick , equatorial dawn was already lighting the open space by the spring . At first Shackleton could see nothing . Only Bartu 's rigid body beside him told that the native hunter was alive to sights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , a moment later , he saw the palmetto growth opposite to them across the open , sandy space , parted . In the dark aperture something moved . Framed in the dense palm leaves appeared the figure of an enormous gorilla . Shackleton 's heart leaped . This was no gorilla such as he had ever seen before . The great beast body was tawny as a lion . It stood nearly upright and fully six feet tall . I le saw , too , at once what struck him with amazement ,  | the Yellow Ape 's frame differed from that of any of the other large anthropoids . There was no great barrel trunk spreading to horrible proportions above the thighs . Instead , the Ape 's torso resembled that of a man  --  broad across the chest and tapering to a waist . The Ape stepped forward out of the mass of greenery . It moved with a lumbering gait . As it came it turned its face , peering to right and left as though it were looking for some one . " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are safe . " There was no room in Shacklcton 's mind for thought of possible danger . lie was intent on the Ape 's face and features . It seemed to him that he read there more than the brutishness of the thick , dark ape lips and the widespread ape nostrils . Ile read a certain wistfulness  --  a yearning , as though the man lost within the beast looked out at him from his prison and begged for release . Now the sun 's rays struck down into the cleared space before the spring . ' I'hcy made a pool of golden light . The Ape paused . Slowly it stretched its great shaggy , tawny body  --  as a man stretches , meaning to rouse himself from sleep . Its head , ( Iccpsct between the massive shoulders , turned ; its terrible manlike arms lifted toward the lighted east . It seemed fantastically to Shackleton like the dawn of man greeting the ( lawn of day . Would the world believe this ? Would it accept as real this wonder that crouched now to drink from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man might cup his to carry the water to its lips ? " It is going away , " Bartu whispered . " Follow ! " Bartu crept from the blind . Shackleton came close behind him . They moved stealthily , keeping a distance of a hundred feet or more between themselves and the Ape .  | n Shacklcton had occasion to marvel at the black ' 6 ability to move noiselessly , to make himself a part the shifting shadows of the jungle . The Ape was making its way across the Valley . It skirted open spaces along the stream , keeping to the thickets palm and cariti bushes . It moved steadily without hurry alai ni . Bartu followed with untiring cautiousness. - At last the Ape turned and , increasing its pace , moved the Valley close under the lee of the cliffs . Then , at a place where two needles of red rock stood rate from the cliff wall , the Ape passed between them . began to ascend the slope to the palisade above . Bart u motioned Shackleton to hold back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could see , by the sway Id movement of the low growth which covered the slope to where the steep wall of the Valley began , that the Ape Was moving toward a jutting edge of rock , a narrow platrm at the base of the cliff and overhung with shadow . " O He-Who-Sees-Everything , it has its mate there . " The Ape emerged on the rock above them . Something moved from out of the shadows ; something came forward close to the great tawny beast ; something put out an arm , welcoming it . . . . Not another ape , but a girl ! She leaned her head against the great beast 's shoulder . The horror of this struck deep into Shackleton 's soul . He felt rather than saw the native 's terror at this which was neither of the world of beasts nor of the world of men . " O I-Ie-Who-Sees-Everything , a woman who is white ! " whispered Bartu . I tad the two watchers betrayed their presence ? The alight figure of the girl in a flame-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | She knelt there , peering over . He knew by her expresji sion that she did not see him . Shackleton gazed immovably . Who was this girl ? She had a startling beauty . Some fearful resemblance His eyes followed the proudly modelled lips , the imperious chin . When had that same direct , searching gaze from under dark , level brows been in his world before ? It was familiar to him  --  terribly familiar to him . It had looked at him across Marakoff 's table . Marakoff ! It was Marakoff 's look ! Only the child of Marakoff could look like that ! And the Ape . . . there with the Ape . . . . " Good ( ; d ! " I-lad Marakoff done that ! " Ills own ( laughter ! "  | Chapter Seven DEVOTION ACKI.I TON 'S first thought was to keep everything from n . But no ; he knew she must know . Ilcr few and bitter words in comment showed him ( early her horror of the whole affair . " Marakoff and his experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to speak to her further about it . Marakoff 's orris came back to him , " What have women to do with Kicnce ? " Yet he was not without horror himself at what he had seen . But after a while his pride came to his rescue . A secret desire that Marakoff , who had so honoured him and trusted him , should not prove dishonourable , drove him to seek further evidence . Still other words of Marakoff came to him : " Judge not ; not for the selfish reason that you be not judged , but because you do not know . Who are you , to judge ? " Who was he , after all , to judge Marakoff ? He must find out more . The revulsion of his own mind was ternpercd by the new possibilities opened to him . If in time he could win the confidence of Marakoff 's daughter , what undreamed-of light might she not throw on the subject of his quest . I is did not risk going near the cliff again . It was possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might resent any attempt at intrusion into his world .  | It was practically certain , though , that the Ape would come to the spring again . Shackleton had waited during two dawns , now , but the Ape had not come . Now he was waiting in the early afternoon , when the intense heat sometimes sends beasts to seek water . If the Ape failed to come , he determined to take up his watch in the blind that night . The heat , somewhat tempered by a storm that had swept the Valley in the early morning , was intense inside the blind ; but Shackleton hardly thought of it . It was as though in the long moments of waiting he were living two lives  --  one the keen hypersensitive life of hearing and seeing and watching , bounded by the little space of tropical beauty before him , where at a short distance the green karaka trees , interlacing their finger-like leaves with tropical fronds , and sweet-scented mamura blossoms , surrounded the spring as a massive setting surrounds a jewel . The other life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory and speculation and possibility , in which it almost seemed that Marakoff himself were there in the blind with him . Some of Marakoff 's questions came back to him now , heavy with meaning . Ile had asked whether Shackleton intended to marry . Shackleton had told him of his love for Joan Merringt on and his intention of marrying her . Marakoff had pondered that in his deep , quick way , and . then had said , " You people from the States are a delightfully proud and confident people . With Americans of your type , to be in love with a woman is , so far as fidelity is concerned , practically to be married to her . It would not be conceivable to you that you should ever care for anyone else , I suppose ? " And Shackleton had replied quickly , and a little haughtily , " No , not conceivable . " It was at that point that Marakoff had taken from his  | the large pomegranate that rested there , near a little African god , and turned the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Marakoff had his advice  --  almost his warning : ? some men I would say , Either give up the woman , up science , ' for woman and science are old enemies . do not say that to you . For years I have studied The keynote of your nature is honour ; and honour essence is pride . You are a born scientist ; but if I rightly , you carry no doubt in your mind that you despite that fact " ? a little sardonic smile played over p% ? " be faithful to your ' Joan . ' " ow , recalling Joan 's bitter attitude toward Marakoff , rnccl to him that perhaps he should have taken Mara 's warning more seriously . Perhaps he should have ittcd and remembered that women and science were , Marakoff had said , old enemies . Perhaps he should er have allowed Joan to come with him into the Val . The glory of his marriage , the almost mad happiness having her beside him , yes , all that had been a greater . y than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n inconsistent with that if he had insisted that she wait r him at the Mission . As it was , instead of the clear ultation he should have felt at coming within sight of ? it goal , her disapproval had checked and disturbed him . " Nia akoff 's daughter ! " his thought ran , defensively . ? Yes , and why not ? Why did not that add , even , to the magnificence and costliness of Marakoff 's experiment ? Religion had often enough through the ages demanded its human sacrifices , and for no reason but religious fanaticism ; whereas Marakoff , for the benefit of science and for the benefit of the world , had undertaken a longer and heavier sacrifice . " A scarlet parrot flew across the vividly green space ahead 1  | of Shackleton , like a soft-feathered flight of flame . He did not notice it . In his mind 's eye he saw Marakoff 's daughter , and he recalled the obvious affection she had for the great Yellow Ape . Beauty and the Beast ! Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marakoff 's own face , but with everything dark or sinister absent from it . And Marakoff must have foreseen all the effect this vision of the girl and the Ape would have on him , must have foreseen it that night when he had given him the notes . Ile had a great longing now to know everything that the notes contained . But no ; as yet he had not come upon the signal  --  a pomegranate . Question and speculation piled up in his mind . How long had the girl been there ? How long since Marakoff had seen her ? Did she know she was Marakoff 's daughter ? A light chatter , as of a breeze in leaves , roused him . Then came the shrill approaching screams of small monkeys . A band of them suddenly blackened and enlivened the upper branches of the trees round about . Pell-mell they tore along , or , hanging by one arm , they dropped to lower branches , or climbed and swung to higher ones . Once they linked their arms and bodies and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scattered , like a broken string of dark beads . The last one , seizing a manzu nut and rising on its legs , like a man , threw it down viciously into the pool below , where it splashed ; then that one , too , vanished as the others had done . As they went they took sound with them . Stillness and silence returned , now that they were gone . A long-tailed barabu , bright purple , with orange wings and a high yellow crest , flew  --  floated , almost it seemed ? across the emerald shade . Shackleton 's eyes had hardly finished following its noise-  | Right , stillness across stillness , when the doors of his opened sharply at a strange , high , mellow sound , a ring , watery mellowness . Presently it ceased , and then began again . Shackleton tilicd it now as the sound of a wood instrument of c kind . Was it by such means  --  the soothing power of ic ? that Marakoff 's daughter had control of the Ape ? as he to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cr over the great beast ? I k leaned forward , peering through the opening in c blind . As he did so , there stepped noiselessly into the cp-green open space in which the pool of the spring lay , a young man , lithe and tall . He wore only a loinoth and was bronzed by the sun . He was playing upon a flute . As under a spell , Shackleton watched him . For a moment he played on , a brief turn and flight of high and delicate notes ; then he went to the spring , made a cup of a leaf , stooped and dipped it in the water , and drank . The man 's face and features were fine and aristocratic , obviously a heritage from one of the older races of Europe . The hair , sweeping back from a well-proportioned forehead , was almost black . There was a marked alertness and awareness in him ? a kind of dark brightness , too , heightened by the contrast between the pale bronze of the face and the extreme darkness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and carefully , as though some sixth sense warned him of a strange presence . A small twig gave way under Shackleton 's foot . Immediately the young man stood arrow-straight and tense . Almost at the same moment he backed toward the greenery through which he had come , put his hands behind him ,  | opened it as though it had been a curtain , stepped behind it , and disappeared . The ferns swung stilly , wisely into place again . Shackleton 's heart pounded on for a moment . Then the strained attention at which he had held himself relaxed and a stream of exultant thoughts began to pour into his mind . What a thing to tell Joan ! What a vindication of Marakoff ! Marakoff 's experiment ! A thing which Joan had believed was a thing of horror and which he himself had mistaken for a dread and unlovely thing ! Marakoff 's experiment ! This man and the girl , alone in a Valley like Paradise , with the great Ape subservient to them ! Who but Marakoff would have set such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam and Eve in Eden , with the beasts to wait upon them . Marako ( T had known , no doubt better than most men , the world and its mad follies and fancies . In this way he had chosen to protect his child from the world 's withering ways . he had placed her and the young man alone in an inviolate valley . And back of this experiment still other possible experiments loomed  --  other problems that Marakoff had perhaps attempted to solve  --  the problem of highly organized beings dealing with primitive needs and conditions ; the problem of man and woman alone and dependent on each other , facing only love and time and joy and death  --  all the great formative powers of life . But Shackleton 's scientific habit of mind , brought one question sharply to him . Was this young man a willing or an unwilling prisoner ? Was the name of Marakoff a beloved or a dread thing to him ? These were questions to which Shackleton felt he must have the answers . But how approach anyone as tensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight sound told him the young than , though he had retreated , was still there . He was no doubt watching . Shackleton took his resolve quickly . He stepped from the blind into the open ; approached the sandy place in front of the spring ; stooped , and with his finger wrote in large letters , one word in the sand : MARAKOFF Then pretending to leave the place , he went a little distance into the growth of ferns at one side , and waited . The answer to all his questions would lie in the manner in which the young man responded to that name . It seemed a long time that he waited . Then the curtains of greenery parted and again the man stepped in front of them . He stood a moment , waiting and listening . Then proudly , but still cautiously , he approached the spring and bent to look at the writing . Shackleton , watching , saw him stoop lower , with infinite , incredulous caution . The bending was so slow that Shackleton had time to suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to this young forest creature written characters were not known . Suddenly the bending form dropped to its knees . Raising its arms slightly , it made a saluting gesture that reminded Shackleton of the gestures he had once seen a priest of the Russian Church make , bowing before the high altar . The young man bent down deeply and laid his forehead against the name of Marakoff . Not horror , then ! Devotion ! Shackleton stepped into the opening . The young man sprang to his feet . Shackleton , his two hands outstretched , palms up , to show that his coming  | was unarmed and friendly , and keeping his eye steadily on the searching , dark eyes of the stranger , took a few steps toward him . But before he could reach him , the young stranger bent again , like a bow , and covering his brow with his forearms in the Eastern manner of salutation , stooped and put his forehead almost against Shackleton 's feet . When he looked up , there were longing and hunger and ecstasy in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I am Igor ! You come from my master ! My master ! When will he come ? "  | They sat near the spring and talked . There was no evidence in anything the young man had said that he had been aware of Shackleton 's presence in the Valley . So the girl had not told him of having visited the cave . That was strange . What did that mean ? It had taken tact and quick wit on Shackleton 's part to meet Igor 's expectation of Marakoff 's coming . Marakoff 's command , that no one should be told of his death , was not to be broken rashly . Fortunately , it seemed not to enter Igor 's mind that Marakoff might be dead . Also , his profound devotion to his " master " made it easy , apparently , for him to accept Shackleton 's simple statement : " Marakoff wished me to come here . I have come to study the Yellow Ape . " " Ah , " said Igor , " that is like my master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sends you to study the Yellow Guardian . " " Will you tell me about the Yellow Guardian ? " said Shackleton . Igor gave him a shrewd glance . " He did not tell you ? " " No , " said Shackleton , evenly . " He knew that you would ; and I have told you that I saw him only hurriedly at the last . " I Igor began at once . " The Yellow Guardian stays with the others  --  the Black  | Apes  --  in the Inner Valley . There is no other like him . There were but two . He comes out only seldom , or as Marnia , my master 's daughter , wishes . She goes to the mouth of the Valley and calls his name , Samba , ' and he comes . " " You remember , " said Shackleton , taking a chance , " the other one  --  the Yellow One which Marakoff took to London ? " Igor , watching him keenly , breathed a little surprise and relief , " Ah , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shackleton , evenly , " do you think your master and my master separated this one and that one ? " Igor , interlacing his fingers , dropped his hands between his knees and bent forward eagerly . " Always ideas of the soul , " he said , dreamily . " As he put Marnia and me here to prove some truth of the soul , so he separated the Yellow Guardian and his mate , for the same purpose  --  to find out , and to understand , the powers of the soul . As Marnia and I have been all these years together , they  --  the Yellow Guardian and his mate ? have been separated . " He paused . Shackleton waited . " It is no little thin ; to rouse a soul in a mere animal , " Igor continued . " You will know that when you see him . He has suffered  --  as human beings suffer  --  loneliness and loss . Suppose there were only two people in all the world , and one of them should be taken away . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this that has wakened 11 the soul in him . You can see it looking out of his eyes sometimes . Through suffering he has learned to love . He even loves the other ones  --  the great black brutes in the Inner Valley , that chatter . But above all , he loves Marnia.  | soul is developed beyond his body . Marakoff has cued his soul . " " And the Valley  --  the Inner Valley , " said Shackleton , owill you tell me about that ? " " As you know , it is called the Valley of Creeping Men , " Igor replied . " They are not men , but they are far more Manlike than most apes . Sometimes they creep , and sometimes they go erect like men . I have never seen them ; I only hear them . They never leave the Inner Valley . I have never been in it . It is my master 's wish that I should not . I know all about it . I know every inch of it . My master gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " Shackleton , afraid of seeming too curious , let the matter rest there , and they talked once more of Marakoff . At last any remaining barrier of mistrust seemed suddenly to break down . With an almost pathetic willingness Igor poured out the story of himself and Marakoff and Marakoff 's daughter . Igor had gone into the Valley at Marakoff 's wish , and had been given the care of Marakoff 's daughter , and this so that Marakoff might carry out one of his experiments . " I do not know what that experiment is , " he said , " but many nights and many days I have thought of it . Sometimes I think he wants to test civilization ; to see just if it will endure under certain conditions . Perhaps that is why he took me ; for I come of an old civilization , you sec . I come from Poland . " Ah , that was to account for the aristocratic body , the fine oval of the face , the handsome , well-marked features , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Russia , in nineteen-fourteen , " said Igor , " when I was seventeen , that I first met Marakoff . You know what a magnetic mind and personality he has . From  | then on I followed him devotedly . He directed my studies for me . I was always interested in philosophy . " When Marakoff , a year later , left Russia , I wanted to go with him , but Marakoff forbade me . He promised , however , to send for me sometime ; and for my part , I agreed to answer his summons whenever it should come . I promised to do whatever Marakoff demanded of me . " Marnia was born in Russia in her father 's home . She is the daughter of Marakoff and a beautiful Greek woman ? Dornia Eleutherios . " Shackleton , though the name of Dornia Eleutherios struck sharply on his consciousness , showed no surprise , and Igor hurried on with his story : " Exactly three years after my promise to him , Marakoff , who was then in Africa , sent for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arrived he was there , waiting for me . Ile had with him Bantu bearers and runners , belonging to the Yellow Brotherhood . Then we proceeded upcountry . We went to Marakoff 's stockade and hut , not far from the entrance to this Valley . " It was there I first saw Dornia Eleutherios , and for the first time I saw Marnia . She was cared for by an African woman named Mali lior , a daughter of old M'pawwa , the witch-doctor of the Yellow Brotherhood . " You see , Marakoff had given Dornia Eleutherios her choice . She might keep Marnia and remain with her always , but here in Africa ; or she might abandon her altogether and allow her to be brought up in the Valley . " He paused . " She chose the latter . " Soon after this , Marakoff sent Dornia Eleutherios to Douala , and she took ship for England . " One night  --  I recall so well the white moonlight of it ? Marakoff told me exactly why he had sent for me.  | Marnia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would a , ompany us . We were to remain until Marnia was grown or until Marakoff came again . " Marakoff himself made every preparation . Kanaka , one of his trusted men , carried in secretly through the Black Caves the necessary stores , and deposited them in a great cave , where they are still unexhausted . Living in the Valley , as Marakoff knew , is very easy . There is game in plenty . Also , the Valley is safer than you might think . The Black Apes never come into it , as I have said . Somba is a perfect guardian , and there are no wild beasts . " Then came the day when we were to enter the Valley . " Marakoff went first , through the Caves . I followed . I led Mali-Bor . Marakoff had bound her eyes , and she carried the child . " When we were established in the Valley , Marakoff disclosed to me that Mali-Bor was suffering from an incurable condition of the heart . He gave me drugs which I was to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then Marakoff left us . " Igor , recalling it now , put his face in his hands and remained silent a moment . When he took away his hands there was a kind of haggard exaltation in his face . ' These were his last words to me . He said  --  he fixed his eyes , his wonderful eyes , upon me , and he said to me : 41'ou do not regret  --  you will never regret  --  doing what I have asked you to do . ' And I replied : I do not regret ? I will never regret . I shall be faithful until death . ' " When I came to read Marakoff 's instructions on the packet of the drug , I found that there had been provided only enough of the drug to last three years . After that Mali-Bor must of necessity die . "  | Shackleton looked in vain for any horror in Igor 's face as he told him this circumstance . " You see , " said Igor , thoughtfully and a little wearily , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers , " he thought out everything . You see how fearlessly he dealt with the powers of life and death and time . Mali-Bor would live until the child was old enough for me to care for her . " I'hcn Marnia and I would be left here together  --  absolutely alone . " Mali-Bor died as Marakoff had foreseen and planned . I buried her . Marnia and I , starting from that grave , were to follow the path of aloneness . " So Marnia grew and grew , and always she grew more beautiful . And like an assurance , and a seal on the bond between Marakoff and me , more and more the eyes that looked out at me were his . The very turn of her head was his . And when she smiled at me he smiled . " He stopped sifting the sand through his fingers and looked dreamily ahead of him . " You have not seen her . " Shackleton wanted to make a clean breast of everything . He wanted to say : " Yes , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes are the eyes of Marakoff . " He wanted to tell the truth further . I le wanted to tell that Marakoff was murdered in London , three months ago . But Marakoff 's comm:lnd in the letter , " l ) o not mention my death to anyone , " stopped him . " And then , you see , " Igor began , " there was the pomegranate . " Ah , the pomegranate ! " At the entrance to the Inner Valley , on the ledge beside the cliff , is a pomegranate tree . The pomegranates that grow on it are not like any other . They are large , of a deep rose-colour . They have splotches of deeper colour on them , like blood . Marakoff took me to that tree and  | . , it to me . That fruit was to be the sign between and inc the sign of my loyalty . was to live here alone with the most perfect lovein the world , and I was never to take it to myself . was to he my loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continued : " Marnia was , under my direction , remain a child , unawakened . She was to know neither nor mercy nor suffering . She was not to know that thing from which all these things spring  --  love . " You sec ! As Marakoff wakened the Yellow Guardian , he bale me keep the soul of Marnia asleep . Who else Id think in such terms  --  death  --  life  --  the soul  --  time ! " " Even when she was little I was never to allow her to pcnd on me . Always , when she turned to me and would vc leaned against me , I was to forestall and prevent it . t was as though , when some one sleeping , stirs and threatens to wake , you make the room dark again and Mill , so that the sleeper sleeps on . You see , that was it . That has been my task . " And if I had , from year to year , kept my promise and fulfilled my task , if I had never touched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any of the torment of the flesh  --  then at a certain time of the year I to take from the pomegranate tree a perfect fruit and it to the entrance of the Valley , in the Black Caves . was to leave it there , on a certain ledge . From there , I do not know how , it would be taken by some one whom my master had taught to take it . It would in time reach him , no matter where he was , and he would know by that sign that his treasure was untouched . " Shackleton thought of the pomegranate that had lain , that last night , on Marakoff 's table , in Smith Square in London . How little he had dreamed of the real meaning  | of it when Marakoff had taken it up and turned it thoughtfully in his hands . " And each year you have sent the fruit ? " he said . Igor nodded , and hid his face . " Year by year she has grown more beautiful , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been loyal . In her eyes there is no awakening . In her the soul sleeps utterly . " Shackleton , much moved by Igor 's story , turned the conversation now to other things , and asked many questions concerning the Valley as Igor and Marnia had known it . Igor answered these questions , apparently with much willingness , but he soon rose to go . " It is time now for me to leave you . Since you come from my master , we shall be as brothers . My master must have given you instructions , too , as to Marnia . " Again Shackleton 's impulse was to make a clean breast of everything ; but instead he said : " Marakoff knew that I would find you , and that you , knowing I came from him , would tell me what you have told me . That was like him . There was not time to prepare you for our meeting , and so , I suppose , in fairness , he would not prepare me . Besides , as I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was with him . " Igor looked out darkly , under dark brows . " But no message ? " he said . " No message at all ? " Again Shackleton 's impulse was to deal openly . Again Marakoff 's injunction stopped him . " No , he gave me no message  --  unless it were message enough that he took the pomegranate in his hand and turned it . When I said , flow beautiful it is ! ' he put it down , and his hand lingered on it  | Ah , his beautiful , long hand ! " murmured Igor , closhis eyes . Shackleton continued : " Arid he said , Far more beautiful than you can ; ; guess . ' " The next instant Shackleton was sorry he had told the incident ; for , obviously , it was like a benediction to Igor and like a renewal of his vow . He bent his head , and Shackleton saw that his lips moved soundlessly , as though in some prayer of a second consecration . The next moment Igor raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girl 's voice , calling  --  the voice of Marakoff 's daughter . Igor turned tensely to Shackleton . " Will you go now ? I will tell her . I will prepare her for your being here . "  | Chapter Nine DEATH-IN-THE-DARK " You are stunned by Igor 's story . Perhaps you are shocked . But remember that is to set self above science . The true scientist recognizes but one god  --  knowledge . To that god he is ready to sacrifice all , even himself . " Then the quick black line  --  one felt the imperiousness of Marakoff 's pen making the stroke that told that the message in the notes for that day was complete . Shackleton was to read no further . The words seemed burned into Shacklcton 's mind . Immediately on leaving Igor he had come back to the cave . He had gone at once to the packet of Marakoff 's notes . In them he had read the full confirmation of Igor 's story . Now , while Joan slept , Shackleton lay wakeful and with senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discoveries of that day . The Ape  --  the girl , Marnia  --  Igor  --  and behind these three  --  Marakoff . Marakoff moulding their lives and destinies . For whatever belief Igor may have entertained as to Marakoff 's purposes , Shackleton was convinced that the true experiment on which Marakoff had been engaged was not the test of civilized man 's ability to cope with primitive conditions , but the test of Igor 's loyalty under almost superhuman temptations . He had not yet been able to bring himself to tell Joan the full story . He had listened to her wondering comment , but made almost none of his own . He knew what  | oan 's reaction to it would be . No , Joan would not underStand . These were , as Igor said , great forces that Marakoff had chosen to deal with . I t was clear enough to him now the real reason why Marakoff had given implicit orders that he was never to mention Marakoff 's death . This injunction , which he had construed as Marakoff 's means of ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this experiment , the experiment of Igor and Marnia . Marnia ! The memory of the girl 's face bloomed now against the darkness as the pearl-white blossoms of the moon vine un . close suddenly , magically , against the hot blackness of the tropical night . Like the moon vine , too , she was white and cool and passionless . Unawakened , Igor had said of her . Shut away in this secret Valley . Marakoff 's daughter . His mind played with that astounding fact , holding it up , examining it , finding in it new marvels . The child of Marakoff and Dornia Eleutherios . And how magnificently Marakoff had planned it all , even to the smallest detail . With what care he had set Igor apart in loneliness to watch and guard his daughter ? his treasure ! For how long ? Until , he came back to the Valley , Igor had said . What would happen if he disobeyed Marakoff 's orders , if he told Igor the truth ? Suppose he said to him : " Marakoff is dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that revelation have upon Igor ? As he put the question to himself he considered Igor 's tense , strained face ; a face in which something seemed forever quivering , though it was quite still . He was like a  | violin whose strings have been keyed too tightly . A touch and . . . . No , Shackleton decided , Igor would not be able to sustain the shock of that truth given suddenly . Marakoff meant more to him than all the world beside . To be told that all this had been swept away , was no more , might unbalance him . Either he would break under it or  --  and Shackleton felt this to be much more likely , as he knew it to be infinitely more dangerous  --  he would stiffen . He would become even more fixed in his fanatic devotion to Marakoff . The shackles that bound him would be locked tighter . Marakoff dead would become even more powerful over him than the living Marakoff had been . Yes , that much was clear . IIe must not tell Igor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was this not Marakoff 's experiment ? Was not he  --  it was Marakoff 's word ? a collaborator with MarakofT ? Ile turned restlessly , seeking sleep . But sleep would not come . The ( lark was too full of figures . Ile slipped from his couch , taking care not to waken Joan , and went to stand at the mouth of the cave . " Will I le-Who-Sees-Everything never forgive ? " It was Tongo 's voice , a little mournful and deprecating . The voice of one who expects rebuff . " I have forgiven , " Shackleton said . " I lave I not ordered that you be here as watchman again ? " There was a certain relief in conversation even with this simple black man . Tongo reached and laid a handful of twigs on the fire . " I have kept it low , " he said , " that I might see what there is to see . " Shackleton looked out across the Valley . Below them the watchfire in the natives ' camp winked a red response to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim of  | the Valley to the north he could see the recurring flash of ht against the night sky caused by the volcanic fires within the Inner Valley . Nearer , though at some distance s down the outer valley , another light shone , danced , disappeared , then shone again . It was , Shackleton knew , the acetylene torch carried by the hunting party led by Bimbi . They had gone with nets to catch birds . Many of these roosted at night in the low trees and could be taken alive easily by first flashing a bright light on them . " Is it the hunters you see , Tongo ? " he asked . " " Those and other things . " The man 's voice was solemn . " The dark is very full of things . " " how like the Africans ! " Shackleton was thinking . Tongo might wear the outward signs of the new religion he professed  --  he might make the sign of the cross before he sat at meat  --  but that gesture did not prevent his also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh to the gods of his fathers who dwelt in trees and rocks and all forms of animal life . He noticed , too , the grey antelope horn which hung from a leather thong about Tongo 's neck . He had no doubt that in it was carried some cherished amulet against malefic spirits . As he stood , there came to him , borne on the night breeze , that eerie , far-off chattering . Remembering what Igor had told him of the Inner Valley and the Black Apes that frequented it , the sound became doubly sinister . He had the impulse to speak of it to Tongo , to reassure him . No , better not . The chattering seemed to him to grow louder than before . It was answered by a long-drawn , wailing , terrible cry from the natives ' camp . Shackleton started . He remembered that Bimbi was away with the hunting party ; Bartu , too ; the two he trusted most . He made a sign to Tongo to remain on  | guard before the cave , then let himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer way by the path . When he reached the encampment he found it in a turmoil . The blacks , excited and gesticulating , milled about the hard-packed square on which the huts opened . Some one had thrown an armful of fresh fuel on the fire . It blazed high , gleaming on the swaying black bodies and on the points of spears and assegais . It lighted with a blue metallic lustre the tattooings that covered the breast and thighs of Niamkala , who stood beside it . His voice , shrill and piercing , rose above the chorus : " Why do you serve a white master ? Do you not hear the gods ? " Obviously , Niamkala had gone back to his native beliefs and fears . In a few minutes he would have all the other men with him . The men crouched . They had their eyes fixed on him . Even Shackleton 's coming made no impression on them . Shackleton elbowed his way through the throng . As he did so he knew that he was not only stepping into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was stepping into the dark , tangled undergrowth of the African mind . Shackleton spoke sharply : " Niamkala , what would Father Hilary think if he could hear you now ? " The words stopped Niamkala . He paused a moment and looked with frenzied eyes . " There are many things Father Ililary does not know . The chattering of the gods is older than Father Hilary . It was here before he brought news of the pale-faced God . " Shackleton knew now that only stern measures would answer . " Niamkala ! " His voice rapped out the words . " All of you . Do you think I would be here , do you think I would  | . me to this Valley if the Great One and the Chattering ? nes were against me ? Could they not have prevented ate ? And the Yellow One  --  has not Bartu told you that I have looked upon it and it has not harmed me ? Am I the chosrn one ? " lie paused . His eyes roved from one to the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . " Niamkala , now you may go . You have not been true to your trust . These men have offended only as they have listened to you . But you  --  why should I keep a traitor with me ? " As he spoke , Kolak sprang close to him and crouched at his feet . " Master , do not punish Niamkala . Do not reward him according to his iniquities . " With the swift change of emotion characteristic of the African , the blacks joined in Kolak 's wail : " I ) o not send him away . " Shackleton turned . Niamkala bent lower than the rest . " 0 He-Who-Sees-Everything , " his voice moaned , " keep me ! " Shackleton 's sternness hardly relaxed . " You may stay , but see that nothing of this kind ever occurs again . " Kolak , he saw with a grim smile , had taken a rosary of betel nuts from his loin-cloth and was rapidly fingering its beads in an excess of devoutness . Shackleton turned on his heel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came trailing into the firelight . All but Toolumbo . He bounded into the midst of the group with a great snow-white ibis clutched to his breast . " Food flew , but Toolumbo was swifter , " he shouted . " Belly said to hand , Be quick ! ' "  | Shackleton breathed more freely . With a low command to Bimbi to watch , and in case of further disturbance to call him , he went back by the path to the cave . As he reached the ledge he saw with alarmed surprise that the watchfire was nearly out . " Tango ! " he cried , sharply . There was no answer . He kicked at the heap of embers , and instantly a pillar of smoke and sparks sprang into the air . They lighted something that was tumbled in a dark heap on the other side of the watchfire . Shackleton bent over it . Tongo ! He lay , fallen upon his face , in a spreading dark pool . Something gleamed between his shoulderblades  --  the handle of a knife driven in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no question that he was dead . Shackleton 's mind was filled with a single devastating fear . He sprang into the cave crying : " Joan ! Joan ! Are you safe ? " The light of his electric torch showed her to him where she lay on her couch , motionless and with eyes closed , ! ' one arm thrown out over the blue sleeping-robe . His cry did not rouse her . Sick with dread , he approached the couch . As he did so his foot struck against a little heap of smouldering leaves not two feet from where she lay . He was conscious of an odor , half familiar and like the scent of autumn gardens carrying the prescience of death . " Joan ! " he cried again , hoarsely , and bent over her . She was not dead . He saw she breathed evenly and gently . But she did not wake at his touch  --  only lay like one at the gates of death . And on her breast lay something  | rk and loathsome  --  a black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , severed at the wrist . Shackleton reached to take it , to hurl it away , but he was seized with a sudden dizziness . The dead ape 's hand dropped from his grasp as he fell , stupefied and inert , across Joan 's still body .  | " Go ! " HE WAS lying on the ledge outside the cave . Sunrise was brightening the Valley . There was a buzzing in his temples  --  a curious lightness that made his body seem not his own ; a sense of having newly emerged from some hideous dark . He lay and looked at the fresh , early dawn light silvering the world below him . What was the menace he had escaped from ? He struggled to remember . Bit by bit it came back  --  the voices of the Chattering Gods , Niamkala 's haggard , bloodshot eyes , that grim and terrible ape hand on Joan 's breast . " Joan ! " He struggled to rise . " Have no fear . I was in time . Little Spear will live . " Bimbi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little distance from him . Bimbi knelt beside her . Ile was wringing a linen cloth in water and laying it across her nostrils . " Now breathe , " he said , slowly , distinctly , as one speaks to a child or to a person under a spell . " Breathe long and deep . The dampness will cure you . " " Bimbi , she 's all right ? " Shackleton bent over her anxiously . She lay so still ? as he had seen her lying on her couch in the cave with that dreadful thing on her breast .  | " In a little while , " Bimbi said , slowly , still intent on his ministrations . " Bimbi , what was it ? " Bimbi turned his head to look over his shoulder at Shackleton . His face was stern , almost rebuking . " Master , what if I had not come ? It was Death-in-the1 ) ark . " Death-in-the-Dark ! That , Shackleton recalled , was the natives ' name for a herb , the leaves of which , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sufficient length of time , would produce first unconsciousness and then death . That heap of leaves smouldering beside Joan  --  that pungent odor like the scent of crushed chrysanthemum leaves ? why , why that was what had overcome Tongo on that night before when Joan had seen the shadow girl in the cave . His mind struggled to free itself from the drugged smoke to grapple with this new problem . Who had done this thing ? Marnia ? Or Igor ? Were Igor 's story and his apparent friendliness merely a blind ? Could these two be plotting against him ? Would they .. . murder ? He remembered Tongo 's huddled body , the gleam of the knife plunged between his shoulderblades , and then , only slightly less horrible , that hairy black hand lying on Joan 's still breast . " Bimbi , " he said sharply , " you saw ? " " Yes . What was there . " Bimbi 's hands kept methodically at their task pressing the wet cloths over Joan 's face . Ile said , quietly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that . Little Spear will never know . But you know ; I know . " His voice lowered portentously . " Never forget that thing . It is the sign . It  | means one thing  --  only one thing ? ' Go . ' You will not disobey a sign like that ? " A grim look came into Shackleton 's face . " Tell me what you know , " he said , slowly . And when Bimbi did not reply at once : " You are a man of the jungle . You see many things that arc lost to me . What have you seen ? What do you know of this girl who is in this valley ? " Bimbi rose now . " I have seen , " he said , gravely . " She is a child . She is a creature . Is it for men to be afraid of a sleek-throated bird which flits hither and yon with no purpose ? She joined us on the hunt . The men feared her because she is so white . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frces , but she only laughed . " Shackleton thought quickly . " She was with you all the time ? " " Always following us . But when we came near the camp she left us and went away . " Not Marnia , then . Then it was the man . Or  --  a fresh suspicion flashed across Shackleton 's mind  --  or the Ape . Could the Ape have used a knife like that ? As deftly , as surely as a man might ? Not the Ape alone , of itself . That was hardly credible . But the Ape directed , commanded by some clear and evil intelligence As though he had followed the trend of Shackleton 's thoughts , Bimbi bent suddenly close to him . He said swiftly : " Master , after this , surely you will go . There are terrible and evil things in this Valley . " Shackleton looked at him sharply . " Bimbi , this could n't have been one of the men ? " Instead of the stout denial which he expected , Bimbi looked far off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best men might do when they are directed by evil spirits ? " Shackleton did not answer but said : " Bimbi , what about Tongo ? What will the men think ? " Bimbi understood . He had already thought of everything . " The men need never know , Master . Tongo was a great eater . They can think that Tongo died as men Wmctimes die , from too great feasting after the hunt . " " Good . I trust you , Bimbi . " The Valley was full of danger . That which had killed Tongo had done so for one purpose only  --  to gain entrance ' to the cave and bring Death-in-the-Dark to Joan . The black ape hand which the killer had laid on her breast was proof of that . Joan must be constantly protected . She must stay in and around ' the cave . When he himself was absent , Bimbi must never leave her . As to himself , he would go on with his work but he must carry it through as quickly as possible . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour which under the influence of the drug had left her face was flooding back . Her eyelids fluttered . " Master " ? Bimbi 's voice had a new note of trouble ? " Tongo had a charm . It was in the antelope horn . Tongo wore it about his neck . The horn is not there . The thing which killed him has taken it . " Shackleton had no reply for this . Joan was stirring . She opened her eyes . She looked up at him wonderingly , as though not comprehending why he should be kneeling beside her with such an anxious face . " Where am I ? " She put out one arm . Then she lifted it , staring at her hand in horror . It was covered with blood .  | " Ned ! " He leaned swiftly and with his handkerchief wiped the blood from her hand . " Bimbi has just come back from the hunt , " he said , reassuringly . " See , there is his net of birds . " He would not tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above all , she must not know of the 11 p menace that had crept close to her while she slept . 11 111 " The wind blew smoke from the fire into the cave , " Ii he went on . " I thought you seemed overcome by it . Bimbi She accepted his explanation without comment . She seemed content to lie without movement , looking across ithe bright Valley and smiling gently , her hand in his . The sense of how nearly he had lost her swept over him in a wave of agony . He stooped and gathered her in his arms . His lips found hers . " Dear old Joan ! What a brick you are ! " Still disturbed by the thought of that unknown visitor 1'I in the night , Shackleton went down the path toward the brought you out here in the clean air . " spring . Ile looked sharply as he went , hoping to espy ' some footprint or other clue that would reveal who or is what had brought Death-in-the-Dark to the cave . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed with many footprints  --  his own , Igor 's , a dozen jll that he knew to be the natives ' . He was stooping over a wide , clumsy spoor driven deep in the sand , which he believed to have been made by the Ape , when the rustle of something moving in the thicket R ! I ' beyond caused him to lift his head sharply . No , he had not been mistaken . Something was there , hidden behind the veil of green .  | The sand silenced all sound as he strode across the clear space . With the utmost care he parted the green tangle of vines from before his face and looked . Ile was looking directly down a narrow glade in the tropical growth . There framed in its greenery he saw the ( girl , Marnia . She was stooping , leaning forward with hand outstretched , trying to entice a beautiful turquoiseblue bird , about the size of a pheasant , to come to her . Her voice , soft and caressing , uttered a low , wordless call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird stood poised , its lovely bright head turned to one side , watching her . She called again . It stepped delicately and with little timid pauses across the glade . A shaft of sunlight striking through the tropical growth flashed on its wing , its proud crest , its long , trailing tail of heavenly blue . " The Bird of Heaven ! " Shackleton thought . He recognized it immediately from all he had read of it . It was one of the rarest and shyest of the jungle birds . He had always wanted to see it . He had given orders that the men be on the lookout for it , but he had hardly hoped ever to see it . The exquisite , exotic beauty of that moment seemed to him as unreal as those dark and horrible happenings of the night . Almost as fascinated as the bird , he watched the girl bend lower . He saw her hold out her arm invitingly , saw the bird step shyly and delicately upon her wrist . She drew her other hand down its bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he heard her say . The Bird of Heaven raised its head . It uttered its first tentative notes , then , emboldened , poured forth a fullthroated pan of song .  | While he listened , enthralled , he heard the girl say : " Now I will see where the song comes from . " Before he could gather her meaning he saw her hands tighten upon the bird , saw her strangle it and with careful , enquiring fingers begin to tear it apart .  | Chapter Eleven YELLOW GUARDIAN " SHE is a creature . " Bimbi 's words came back to Shackleton with new force . Disgust , horror , almost a loathing for one who was so beautiful and so entirely heartless swept over him . But immediately he remembered her upbringing . What had Igor said ? She was to know neither pity nor suffering , since she was not to know love  --  that power from which these flow . What was to be expected of a girl whose life had been moulded along those lines ? That which in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than curiosity and eagerness about life , that took no account of life 's suffering because it had no understanding of it . And he thought , too , how like Marakoff ! That eagerness , that curiosity , that burning desire to know . She had not been in the least aware of his presence . He was sure of that . He had stepped back , and the green growth had closed silently and completely behind him . Though he had made no mention of the incident to Joan  --  a rather white and languid Joan  --  it remained disturbingly present in his mind . So when , the day after , he went with Bartu to explore the upper part of the Valley , and he suddenly came again on Marnia , he felt no surprise . This time she saw him even before he saw her . She was standing in a little open space , under a great diola ,  | looking at him with wide eyes , her shoulders slightly lifted . From her hair , Shackleton saw with a pang , floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartu to go back a little way from him . He was determined not to frighten or offend this girl , who resembled in so many ways some of the wild creatures of the jungle . It was she who spoke first . " I have seen you before , " she said , and now she smiled faintly ; " you and the woman . " " Yes ? " Shackleton replied . " When was that ? " " You ought to know . I left the jewel . " She came toward him . There was simplicity and friendliness in her manner . " I left it for you . Not for her . " " And I have brought it back to you , " Shackleton said , gently . Ile took the opal out of his pocket and held it out to her . She did not look at it , but at him . " Why ? " she asked . " Do n't you like it ? Do n't you think it is pretty ? " " It is much more than pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even I , who know nothing of jewels , can see that . In the world outside this Valley there are men who would give half their lives to possess a jewel like that . " " But why ? " " Because it means power , " Shackleton said . " The man who had that could be very powerful , if he liked . There would be very little that would be shut away from him . " " I see . " She took the opal and fingered it a moment thoughtfully . Then she slipped the chain about her neck . " I like it because it is pretty and because my father  | gave it to Igor for me . My father brought it from Russia , long ago . " Then she added , " Igor has told me that you come from my father . " He made a grave inclination of the head . " And did my father tell you nothing about me ? " " He told me , " Shackleton replied , " that I would find that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed suddenly and clapped her hands . " I like you , " she said . " You are different from Igor . I shall call you He-Who-Is-Different ' ! " What an ingenuous child she was ! " There are many things you can tell me , if you will , " Shackleton said . " Things about the Valley , and things about the Ape . " " You mean Somba ? " she asked . " Igor has told me , " Shackleton went on , " that Somba lives in the Inner Valley . I want to go there  --  " He was amazed at the swift change in her face . She frowned darkly . " The Valley is no place for you , " she said . " Even Igor never goes there . Only Somba and I. There are powers in that Valley . It was my father who called them the Creeping Men . ' Why should you presume to think you could go there ? " " You mean the Black Apes are to be feared ? " Shackleton asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I go where I will , " she said , haughtily . " Everything is mine . I am obeyed . " Her arrogance amused him . The hauteur of a child who has never known interference with its wishes . Evidently the Valley , and perhaps the fact that by IVIarakoff 's command she was permitted to enter it while Igor might not , meant much to her .  | He did not pursue the subject now . He spoke again of his desire to see and to study the Yellow Ape . " I would not harm it in any way . Your father knew that I wanted to study it . He helped me . I am hoping you will help me , too . " Again he felt the level scrutiny of her gaze fixed on him . Would she guard the Ape as jealously as she guarded the Inner Valley ? Then her face broke into a smile . " I will show you . But  --  that man you brought " ? her look went to Bartu ? " send him away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ape , and especially to sec the girl control it , as Igor had told him she did , overcame his caution . I Ie called Bartu and gave him the order to go . The man crouched submissively , then disappeared . " Wait here , " Marnia said . " I will call Somba . I will tell him . " She flitted away from him . Shackleton had a sense of having crossed the threshold of a new and stirring adventure . A sense , too , that he was now , and not of his own will , quite definitely involved in some relationship with Marakoff 's daughter  --  good , bad , safe , dangerous  --  he did not know ; but involved . And Igor ? He had not come to the camp as Shackleton had hoped and expected he would . lgor had poured out his story to him . Perhaps because of that Igor was restrained by a certain shyness and regret . 1 lad he told him too much ? At a little distance he heard Marnia 's voice , clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Somba , I want you ! " Not anything that had happened to Shackleton since he  | came into the Valley gave him so great a sense of wonder , almost of unreality , as what followed . Out of the grove Marnia and the Yellow Ape came toward him , the girl so slender , so proud , so indescribably lovely , and beside her the great lumbering beast . Beast in body , yes , but out of those dark , mournful eyes , in which a red light shone at the corners like haws in the eyes of an old hunting-dog , it seemed to Shackleton something looked that was not beast . He had come on legends in West Africa of a people who mated their women with apes . The Yellow Guardian recalled this to him . For in the creature 's haunting resemblance to man was not so much the suggestion of an ape who had attained manliness , as of a man lost in an ape . Though obviously the Ape was prepared for the presence of a stranger , Shackleton could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraining hand on his shaggy shoulder . " Somba ! " She turned to Shackleton . " You see ? " " It is wonderful , " Shackleton said with fervour . " Tell me , how much does he understand ? " " He understands a great deal , " Marnia replied . " You shall see . Somba ! " The beast turned its eyes to her . " Somba , I would drink . " The Ape lumbered off . It went a short distance and began tearing some green water-vines that twined about the rocks . It returned , its hands full of trailing pieces of vine and pods . These it held out to Marnia . It stood looking down at her with anxious solicitude while she broke several of the pods and drank the pure water they contained . Though she did not look at him , Shackleton could see that Marnia was enjoying to the full not only her power  | over the beast , but the effect this was having on Shackleton as he watched her . She seated herself on the springy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat , " she commanded . Again the Ape bent its slow look on her . Then it went straight to a cluster of mango trees . It came back bearing several of the fruits . " You see , Somba will do whatever I command , " Marnia said . " He is mine . " Shackleton knew a momentary sense of dread . That such a great and powerful beast should be at the command of so whimsical and heartless a person as Marnia ! Yet , Marakoff had planned this , too ! Marnia 's voice recalled him , " I-lave I pleased you ? " she said , gaily . " You have given me the greatest help in the world , " he replied . He came across the open space and would have seated himself beside her . The Ape gave a deep , threatening growl . " Samba ! " Marnia spoke the name sharply . " Go ! " Still obedient , the great beast turned . It went lumbering down the path , without once looking back . " You may sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place for Shackleton . " I have shown you what Somba is like . There are things I want you to tell me . " " You must come to the camp , " he said , warmly . " In the day . Joan will want to see you and talk with you . She saw you that night . " But Marnia shook her head . She frowned , " No , " she said , decisively . " 1 will not go there . She ? the woman  --  it is not with her I want to talk . It is with you . " Shackleton smiled at what he toot to be the whimsical-  | ity of a child . He felt sure that curiosity would bring her someday . " And what is it you want to talk to me about ? " he asked . " I want to ask you  --  Igor has told me  --  but I think you who are so different from Igor , can tell me more . " " Yes ? " he said . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for him . I want to go out of this Valley . You will not be staying here always . You could take me with you . " That had been a thought Shackleton had not yet dared form clearly . He did not reply . She dropped the suggestion surprisingly . " I 'll tell you , " she said , and her gaze lifted to him . " You want to go into the Inner Valley . I 'll do that for you first . I 'll take you there . " Shackleton hid his exultation . " When ? " " Two days from now , " she promised . " At this time . Will you come here ? " He took both her hands and bent , looking into her eyes . " I 'll come , " he said . " There 's nothing would keep me from coming . " There was a rustling movement in the group of doum palms that edged the open space . A voice called : " Marnia ! " The palm fronds parted , revealing Igor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shackleton would have spoken , but Marnia was before him . She sprang up , facing Igor . " Why do you follow me ? " she demanded . Her voice was indignant . " Am I no longer my father 's daughter ? " Igor recovered himself almost at once . He came toward them . His eyes went again to Shackle. ton , as though asking forgiveness.  | " This man comes from your father , " he said to Marnia . " Does that not make us brothers ? " As Shackleton returned to the camp the memory of Igor 's dark look made him return once more to his uncertainty as to who the visitor to the cave had been on the night of Tongo 's death . One of his own men  --  or Igor ?  | Chapter Twelve OUT OF THE BLUE JOAN had watched Shackleton disappear along the trail with a vague sense of uneasiness . Not that she feared for his safety as far as the Yellow Ape was concerned . Her faith in Shackleton 's ability to cope with the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f only beasts and jungle terrors were the only dangers the Valley held ! Igor and Marnia 's story , recounted by Shackleton , had made a strong appeal to her pity . The desire to befriend stud to rescue these two who were , as she felt , Marakoff 's victims , welled like a warm spring within her heart . Igor and Marnia . . . both so strange . . . both , in a way , creations of Marakoff 's . Yet , at the same time , she could not rid herself of the feeling that the presence of these two in that Valley added to its dangers for Shackleton and herself . Now , while she was alone , she analyzed this growing conviction of hers with a clarity of judgment that was characteristic of Joan . Of what was she afraid ? Not of Igor . Though she had not seen him , or Marnia , either , she had received an impression of him from Ned 's story of their meeting that was in no way horrible . On the contrary , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleness and sensitiveness . Certainly she was not afraid of Marnia . A fairy child ,  | perhaps , as might be one who had known no other world but this Valley . Irresponsible , gay , heartless , perhaps , as children often are , but nothing more . Then she felt that she was drawing near to the source of that vague uneasiness which filled her . Was there , or was there not , a subtle change taking place in Ned ? It had begun  --  for , yes , she decided now there was a change ? shortly after his meeting with Igor . The change was too indefinite to have a name . But she felt that he had something on his mind ; something disturbing which he had not shared , perhaps had no intention of sharing , with her . What was it that was coming between them ? The girl Marnia ? No . Joan dismissed that thought instantly . Not Marakoff 's ( laughter , but Marakoff . . . . The scene of the previous night came back to her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to waken suddenly perhaps an hour later . A single candle set on a bench made a tiny circle of light in the cave . In that circle Shackleton sat , bent over something that he was reading intently . 1Ie was reading Marakoff 's notes . Joan saw in the candlelight the bent concentration of his brows , the set , determined line of his jaw , and how his lips pressed together as though jealous of some tremendous secret . She stirred , said softly , " Ned . . . " The eyes , following the closely written page , did not look up . She spoke a second time and in a louder tone : " Ned , tell me . Is it something . . . ? " He had started at that . 1 le had thrown a startled glance at her across the candle flame . " As if he 'd forgotten I was there and had suddenly discovered me , " so Joan explained to herself now what she had read in that look of his .  | She had raised herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , " Those dreadful notes , again . . . " And he had laughed shortly ; had folded the notes in their cover and replaced them in the tin box in which he kept his papers . She had heard the key click in the lock . Then he had blown out the candle . A moment later he stretched himself on his bed . She noticed that it was a long time before he slept . Now , after Ned 's departure , with the cave very still and with no particular occupation to engage her , all these uneasinesses , vaguely apprehended before , began to assume form and meaning in her mind . About noon she went out on the ledge before the cave . Bimbi , who since Tongo 's death never left her when Ned was not there , lay in a patch of shadow alternately blinking and dozing after the manner of a dog who seems half asleep , yet is ready to spring up at the slightest sound . As always , never far from Bimbi , the boy Toolumbo sprawled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long grass blade . She could look down into the natives ' camp and see the men at their various occupations . She could hear the voice of fat Mamba , the cook , scolding the pot boys . She could hear also the sing-song of old M'banga , the skinner , as with an artist 's relish for his art he set about the skinning of an antelope the hunters had brought in , and the steady , rhythmic grinding of stone against stone as others ground millet for the making of dolo ( beer ) . At that moment she was conscious of another sound that was unconnected with the camp  --  a dull , persistent throbbing that developed into a humming like that of a giant bee . A shout went up from the natives ; there was a medley of startled cries .  | The sound approached , grew louder  --  the zoom of an airplane . Bimbi had sprung to Joan 's side . Together they searched the sky . There it came , flashing silver and invincible against the cloudless blue . Straight and steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titan 's bow . Joan instinctively raised a hand and waved . It was as though her own world had found its way to her . The plane circled , slowed . It seemed to hover and to peer . It went the length of the Valley , banked , and returned . Then it dropped lower . It was seeking a landingplace ! Toolumbo ran , whimpering , to cover within the cave . There was a note of terror , too , in the cries of the blacks as the great shining bird dropped at last to rest on the green open space in the centre of the Valley . " lt is fitting that I go and see who these are , flying to seek us out , " said Bimbi . " Stay here , Little Spear . " lle dropped over the ledge to the lower ground and ran forward , followed at a little distance by some of the braver of the blacks . Joan , heedless of Bimbi 's words , started down the path . A man was climbing out of the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goggles , revealing the round , smiling , pleased face of Tony Ogle . " Tony ! " " Oh-ho , Jo-John ! " He waved cheerily to Joan , then swung round to Bimbi . " A bit of a leg-pull , eh , Him ? Not expectin ' me , were you ? " " Wherever did you come from ? " Joan began breathlessly as she came up to them . " Out of the blue , of courthe . " He gripped both her hands and shook them vigorously . Delight in seeing her and in his own achievement shone in his eyes . He looked  | from her , wonderingly , to a quick survey of the Valley . " Oh , I thay , what a plathe thith ith ! " " Nothing 's happened . . . ? " she began . " happpened ? I 'll thay it hath , " he interrupted her . " I 've hopped here from Croydon in four dayth . To Yoko , you know . Courthe I 'd been there before . That wath eathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wath the ticklith part . Only for the glimpthe I got of the camp and the thmoke and thothe fellowth , I 'd never have found you . Then you waved . .. " " I mean at home  --  at Cranbrook ? " " Oh , Cranbrook ! Rather not . I mean everythingth ath right ath trumpth . ' Pon my word . " Ile shook her hand again with increased vigor , assuring her thereby of the rightness of all things . Then , suddenly remembering , " Oh , I thay ! " he cried . " Wait a thec ' . I 've got a lady with me , you know . " Ile turned , and to Joan 's further amazement helped a woman to descend from the plane . " Miss Langdon ! You ! " Joan recognized with surprise the American woman who had been one of the guests at the Mission when she and Ned Shackleton had gone there to be married . " How jolly of you to make Tony bring you ! " " I never gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Mary Langdon explained . She laughed shortly at her own determination . " Chance of a lifetime , and I took it . It 's part of my philosophy to take my tarts as they are passed . Americans are like that . I guess you know that , seeing you married one . . . . " " Where'th Thackleton ? " Tony asked . " I 've got a letter for him . " It was on the tip of Joan 's tongue to ask who the sender of that letter might be . She stopped herself in time , how-  | ever , remembering Miss Langdon 's presence . Miss Langdon was really almost a stranger . True , she had been kind and cordial in those few days when Joan had been at the Mission . She and Shackleton had found that they had known each other years before . Mary Langdon , too , had been a student of Marakoff 's . Psychology was her hobby . She had told them she was writing a book about witchcraft . She had come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practices . No , Joan decided quickly . Better not ask , not know . She must be careful , too , not to reveal anything concerning the Yellow Ape ? all that was Ned 's affair  --  or drop a hint as to those still stranger denizens of the Valley  --  Marnia and Igor . " I thay . Get out of that ! " Tony sprang threateningly toward Toolumbo . The boy had found a spear and with the point of it was attempting to investigate the plane 's propeller . Bimbi forestalled him . Ile seized the squirming Toolumbo by the scruff of the neck , lifted him as a terrier lifts a rat , and tossed him on the grass a short distance away . " 0 Son-of a-Chief , let me watch over the great bird . " Niamkala begged the privilege . " I dreamed in a dream of two hawks that fought in the sky . The hawks fell at my feet . Now the great bird has come . . . " " Niamkala will guard it , " Joan assured Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . " We 'll go up to the cave . I want you to sec how snug we are . Ned 's gone up the Valley , but he 's sure to be back soon . " She led the way . Bimbi , with an only slightly crestfallen Toolumbo tagging at his heels , followed . Shackleton found them there when he returned a short time later . He had heard the whir of the plane as he came  | one that fantastic scene with Marnia and the Ape and got- . The sound and the wide range of possibilities it ' resented filled him with anxiety . Now , more than ever . fore , it was important that he should have no interference in his work . The scene that met him as he came to the cave  --  Joan doing the honours of a picnic lunch , Tony Ogle disposing of caviar sandwiches with amazing rapidity , and Mary I.angdon regarding amusedly the antics of Toolumbo invented especially for her benefit  --  was rather an anticlimax . Tony drew him aside with an air of importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A letter ? From whom ? " " From Dornia  --  Lady Thleugh , I mean . " Tony fumbled to reach the inner pocket of his tunic . " The thent for me and athked me if I 'd do thomething for her . Thomething big . And I thaid of courthe . You would , would n't you ? And the thaid it wath to find you where you 'd gone in Africa  --  the gave me no end of inthtructionth  --  and to give you thith . " He drew out a note which he handed to Shackleton . I le turned back to the others , leaving Shackleton to tear open the envelope and unfold the single sheet of paper it contained . A glance sufficed to read the brief message : Do not , I beg of you , interfere with the experiment of Marakoff . He looked up and caught Joan 's glance fixed enquiringly on him . He nodded reassuringly . " I 'll tell you Etter , " that nod implied . Then he slipped the note into his pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must start back to Yoko almost immediately . " But why ? " Joan urged . " How frightfully absurd , Tony . " " I 'm due at Athcot the theventeenth , " Tony said , with the gravity of one who announces a world event . " Ca n't change that . Bethideth there'th a lady . " " Ascot ! " Joan spoke with mocking levity . " We 'll show you the Valley . I have n't explored it yet . Ned 's going to take me ; he 'll take us all . " She stopped , and her eyes went to Ned 's face . He did not second her suggestion . Tony , his mouth full of sandwich , apparently did not notice Shackleton 's silence . But Mary Langdon did . " Ascot or no , young man , I 've got a manuscript waiting on my typewriter at Yoko , and I ca n't be long away from it , " she said , briskly . She stood up and moved out to the ledge before the cave , studying with obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blacks had returned to their camp , all but a dozen or so who squatted in a circle about the plane , and Niamkala standing proudly beside it . The voices of the group within the cave came to her . Tony was asking Toolumbo , " What'th the called , your lithard ? " " She has no name , " Toolumbo said , sadly . " Well , the ought to , you know . Ca n't ring a lady up unleth you know her name . " " Give her a name , Tony , " Joan said . " Toolumbo will worship you forever if you will . " " Call her . . . call her . . . " Tony was evidently considering the lizard 's charms . " The'th one of your thlithery thort . . . . Why not call her Cleopatra ? " " Cle-o-pat-ra , " Toolumbo tried the syllables.  | And here'th a thilling to thtart her off in the world th , " ' Pony added , for good measure . Shack ! don had followed Mary Langdon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Valley . " It 's quite wonderfully beautiful , is n't it ? " he said . Erica takes hold of one . And this seems the very soul A I rim . " She did not at once reply . He saw that her gaze was d on those towering mountain peaks , blue and swimg in the heat , that seemed to guard the Valley like tinels . Then she said , in her own blunt way : " Tell the truth , do you mind awfully our breaking in you like this ? " Shackleton was taken by surprise , but he managed to ly , quite evenly : " Not the least . Why should I ? " " No ? Well . . . By the way , young Ogle brought you letter . I 've brought you a warning . " IIer words , spoken with such apparent carelessness , ? . rticd him . " A warning about what ? " he asked . " Well , to be frank with you " ? she threw out her hand in a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larakoff . " " Marakoff ? " Shackleton 's eyes narrowed . " I do n't believe I understand you . " " Oh , I know it probably seems to you like butting in . I thought of that before I came . I hate people to come interfering with me . But just remember this  --  remember I knew Marakoff , too , " she paused . " I knew him well . " Shackleton 's ear caught what seemed to him an intense bitterness in her tone . His mind pieced together what he knew of Mary Langdon 's connection with Marakoff . Not only had she been his pupil , but she had been in a way  | the subject of certain of Marakoff 's psychological experiments . In a series of articles on psychology which she wrote for an American journal she had not scrupled to expose what she  --  from her woman 's point of view  --  called Marakoff 's ruthlessness . " Perhaps I 'm wrong in calling it a warning , " she went on , still in that curiously remote , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that there 's a warning for you in it somewhere . There 's something I do n't believe you know and I think you ought to know , and I 've come to tell you . Did you ever know a chap out here called Marston  --  Harry Marston ? " " Marston ! " Shackleton recalled the figure of the American engineer with whom two years before , he had played bridge at the British consulate in Douala . Marston was in West A Erica for one of the Belgian rubber companies . Shackleton and he had met only that one time . But he 'd heard of him often . Marston was well known , liked , too . Shackleton had heard later that Marston 's wife had died suddenly at their bungalow upriver , and Marston had been so broken up over her death that he had resigned his job and gone off , no one seemed to know where . " What 's Marston got to do with it ? " he asked , shortly . " That 's what I 'm trying to piece out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you he 's dead . He died about three weeks ago in that den of iniquity Madame Martin keeps at Douala . Died not of drink or native women or any of the usual things that finish men off in the tropics . Marston died of fear . " " Oh , I say ! " Shackleton felt an impulse to laugh . " You 've got something wrong . Marston 's courage was proverbial . He 's been a champion swimmer ; pulled off two life-saving stunts , as I remember . And he had the  | Congressional Medal for something he did at Belleau Wood . Took a machine-gun nest all by himself  --  or something of the sort . Fear and Marston do n't go together in the same breath . " " Exactly . That 's probably why , when fear came into his life  --  some terrible , titanic fear that he could n't rid himself of  --  it was too much for him . Anyway , the little French doctor at Douala , who is my informant , told me that Marston , ce bel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fear of apes . He was haunted every minute of the day by the idea that his wife had been torn apart by apes . " " But how horrible ! " " Horrible ? Yes . And all the more so because really the woman was not attacked by apes at all . She died of fever . Father Hilary told me . He buried her . Marston was downriver at the time . Father Hilary had to break the news to him when he came back . Then Marston went away . What I 've just found out is that he went to Marakoff . " " I do n't see . . . " " You see what happened . " " You mean that you believe that Marakoff put it into his mind that his wife was torn to pieces by apes ? Surely Father Hilary must have told him the truth . Could Marakoff make him believe that Father Hilary was only trying to spare him ? " Mary Langdon did not reply . " Why should Marakoff do a thing like that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her eyes still on those blue , far-off mountain peaks . " As long as I knew Marakoff I never knew him to deal with anyone.without a purpose . And usually a pretty sinister one . "  | Into Shackleton 's mind came the memory of the words he had read in the notes the night before . " The man who would succeed must live his intellectual life on a plane which woman is incapable of reaching . He must cut himself free from the web of pity and mercy ' with which she seeks to entangle him . The man of science rises above mere personalities . His union is with Truth . . . . " Had he read that , or had he sat there in the candlelight and heard Marakoff speak those words ? " I do n't know exactly what your relation to Marakoff was or is , " Mary Langdon went on , with a rather twisted smile . " Only that , in a manner of speaking , he made you his heir . But I do know this . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shackleton picked up her words and gave them back to her , " if you were I . . . ? " She wheeled about and confronted him . " I 'd pack up this expedition and take that fine wife of yours out of this place in double-** time . " And , as Shackleton made no reply : " Not that I 'm afraid of natives or apes or any of the usual jungle tests . I 'm not the sort that is . But there are some things . . . Good Lord ! What 's that ? " That was a sudden rustling in the thicket of carite bushes that overhung the opening to the cave  --  two slender white hands parting the greenery , and in the opening a girl 's face  --  Marnia . Not the gentle , whimsical Marnia of an hour before , Shackleton noted . This Marnia 's eyes blazed ; her delicate nostrils arched with anger ; her lips were primed with scorn . With the lightness of a young panther she dropped from the rock to the ledge before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on Shackleton . " By what  | right have you told your black man that I am not to come here ? Is this not my Valley ? I say to you  --  I say to you this is my Valley . I go where I will . You shall see . " Joan and Tony who were coming to join Shackleton and Mary Langdon , stopped short , and gasped . With that same feline grace Marnia dropped over the ledge and disappeared in the thickets below . " I thay " ? Tony found his habitual aplomb with difficulty ? " who ith the ? " Mary Langdon , her eyes following that ripple of green leaves that marked the girl 's passing , said , softly : " Good Lord ! Marakoff ! " Tony and Mary Langdon left soon after that . Shackleton had said , quite simply : " I 'm asking you both , for the sake of the work I came here to do and all that may come out of it , not to ask any questions and not to say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all . But not just now . " " Oh , of courthe ! " Tony Ogle agreed , amiably . " Not a word , I aththure you . Only  --  I thay  --  you know . . . " Mary Langdon nodded briefly , then put out her hand . " It 's your bailiwick , and each man to his work . That 's my motto . I wish you luck and " ? again that far-away look ? " immunity . " To Joan , as the two stood waiting while Tony cranked the propeller , " I 'll be thinking of you often . I do n't suppose you 'll be here long . And by the look of those natives and your man Bimbi , I 'd say you 're not apt to want for anything . But if by any chance you should , do n't forget I 'm at Yoko . I 'm a reliable sort and used to dealing with nearly anything , black or white . "  | Chapter Thirteen BIRD OF HEAVEN JOAN looked up from reading the note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little troubled frown . " Dornia asks you not to interfere with the experiment of Marakoff , " she said . " What does she mean ? What is it she is warning you against ? " Shackleton threw himself down on the couch of boughs and stretched out both arms in a gesture that had in it not a little of weariness . " You can read it a half-dozen ways , " he said . " You can make a scare headline out of it as to the Yellow Ape ... " Joan interrupted him : " Oh , I do n't believe it has a thing to do with the Yellow Ape . What did Tony tell you ? I saw you questioning him . " " Tony told me quite a lot . IIe was dining at Cranbrook . Lord Sleugh , Dornia and Bob Kenton were there . Kenton had been in Africa . Ile happened to come back on the ship with the man who was bringing the pomegranate to Marakoff . At dinner he told it as a good tale . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly fainted . As I see it she must have known of 1Vlarakoff 's agreement with Igor about the pomegranate . She had probably thought all these years that Marnia was dead . Bob 's story of pomegranate told her Marnia was living . "  | 1 le shrugged his shoulders . " There , I believe is the whole thing . Dornia knows now that she has Marnia to reckon with . " " Of course ! " said Joan . " And now Dornia is married to Lord Sleugh , she has a social position to protect . Suppose it were found out that she had abandoned her child . " " And she 's afraid , " Shackleton explained ? " afraid we will take Marnia back with us . You must have thought of that . We 've both thought of it , of course . " Ile shot her a quick , enquiring glance . It was the first time the subject had been spoken of between them . " I have thought of it , of course , " Joan said , slowly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flaming , creature like that in London . And then the effect on Dobby and Dornia i " " It 's going to be no end difficult , " Shackleton agreed . " What answer did you give Tony for Dornia ? " Joan asked , presently . He laughed shortly . " It was nearly as cryptic as her message to me . I just wrote one line : When I return I will talk with you about Marakoff 's experiment . ' That ought to give the lady food for thought . " But Joan refused to consider Dornia save as a minor character in what she felt was the momentous drama of Marnia and Igor . Dornia could wait . " As to Igor , " she said . She had taken up a flat reed basket filled with long brown pods of the silk-cotton trees , that Bimbi had left in the cave . She lifted one of the pods and set it out on the bench beside her , separating it from its fellows , considering it as though it were Igor . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally , he will have to be consulted about Marnia . " Shackleton did not reply .  | She went on : " Surely Igor will see that Marnia ca n't be taken directly from the sort of life she has had here into the ordinary world . She will have to travel by easy stages . It may be Father Hilary can help us there . " Crack ! There was a loud report that made them both start . The silk-cotton pod had burst , discharging its ball of silver-white capok filaments . " Yes , Igor is the problem , " Shackleton said . " Remember what I 've told you of his devotion to Marakoff . He is high strung and fanatical . Ile is not going to accept the idea of Marnia 's leaving the Valley very easily . " " Poor Igor ! " " Ile 's been out of the world so long . He has nothing of his own to go back to . This is his world , his universe . " She had gathered the capok threads into a little heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned , there 's something . . . . I wonder . Have you thought of this possibility . . . ? " " Thought of what ? " " Have you thought this might be the danger that Dornia intended to warn you about . . . . If Igor should think you were becoming too friendly with Marnia . . . " He recalled Igor 's look when Igor had come up to him and Marnia . Could that be the menace implied in Dornia 's message ? Marnia 's interest in him was too obvious to be ignored . It was , so he explained it to himself , the interest such as any child might feel in the first stranger to enter its tiny world . But Marnia was not a child . And Igor . . . . After all , what did he know of Igor ? Nothing save the story Igor himself had told him , and the corroboration of it he had later read in Marakoff 's notes . Aside from Igor 's consuming loyalty to Marakoff what else did Shackleton know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You come from my master . Are we not brothers ? " They seemed to dispel any doubts that Joan 's suggestion and the message from 1 ) ornia Eleutherios might arouse . He walked restlessly the length of the cave and back again . Joan watched him . " I ca n't think Dornia meant what you suggest , " he said at last . " Remember , Igor understands that Marakoff has sanctioned my coming here . If only for that I believe he trusts me . " " What if he finds out that Marakoff is dead ? " " He wo n't find out . " Shackleton shut his lips firmly . " I 've made up my mind as to that . Not until my work in the Valley is completed , when the time comes for us to leave the Valley . It wo n't be long now . . . . " " But suppose he should ? " she persisted . " How can he ? You 're the only one who could tell him . And you wo n't . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent . Her hands still sifted the gossamer threads of the silk-cotton . " I hate all this deception , " she said at last . " It seems to me so dishonourable . . . . " He stood confronting her , frowning a little . " Surely , you see the reason . . . . " She looked up at him with that shining candour which was so much a part of her . " No , frankly , I do n't . Not reason enough . It seems to me like lying . Oh , Ned " ? her cheeks flushed , her voice grew eager ? " let 's tell him . Let him know that this dreadful experiment is over . Let him feel free to love Marnia and to marry her . " Her voice broke . She rose and came close to him and leaned against his breast .  | " When we are so happy , why should n't they be happy , too ? " The sweetness of her almost won him . Then that very sweetness cried out to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sinister black hairy beast 's hand which had been laid on her breast ? If Igor , believing Marakoff still lived and that Shackleton had been sent by Marakoff , had done that evil , what might he not do if he learned that Marakoff was dead and that Shackleton had not told him ? " No , " he said , and he felt with a pang that she drew away from him , wounded by what must seem to her intentional cruelty . " We 've started this thing . We 've got to sec it through . You 'll have to trust mc , Joan , even if you ca n't understand just why it seems to me necessary that Igor should not know . You 'll have to believe I 'm acting for the best . " " You mean for the good of Igor ? " " Yes , for the good of all of us . " She moved away from him and stood leaning against the rock wall at the entrance to the cave . He saw her figure silhouetted against the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " It 's Marakoff who is making you do that , " she said . Her voice was curiously stifled . " Marakoff . . . . Those notes are influencing you against your true self . I can see it . You are changing every day . You are growing hard and cruel . Like Marakoff . . . . " " Master ! " Bimbi swung himself up over the ledge . He stood there before them , suddenly urgent . " What is it ? " " You will come . There has been hunting . " The insistence in Bimbi 's eyes spoke more imperatively  | than his words . Without reply to Joan , Shackleton followed Bimbi down the path . When a slight turn hid them from Joan , Bimbi stopped . " The hunting has not been of our doing . " " What do you mean ? " " Little Spear must not know . It is for that I called you here . Master , Bartu was your man . He loved you . When you called he sprang quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bartu ? What 's happened to Bartu ? " Shackleton 's voice rapped out . " Tell me quickly . " " Master , he is dead ! " " Dead ! " " I found him lying at the foot of the cliff beyond the spring . His back was broken . He lived long enough to tell me ; then he died . " " How did it happen ? " Shackleton asked . " It was the Bird of Heaven , Master . He heard it singing in the grove . You had bade him get it for you . He searched for it . It called and he followed . Again and again he thought to come upon it . . . . Its song was so near . But always it moved away , he could not see it ; only he heard its singing . It led him to the edge of the cliff . There the carite bushes grow thickly ; he could not see  --  and the bird sang again . So close , almost under his hand . He leaned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp rocks . " What fresh tragedy was this ? His faithful Bartu ! And what terrible toll the Valley exacted ! Tongo first , now Bartu . Bimbi was looking at him with steady eyes . " Master , you do not ask what further thing Bartu said ? " " Tell me . " " He said it was not the true Bird of Heaven , that song he followed . It sounded like the bird . But it was not .  | Bartu was deceived . It meant to deceive him . It was the Devil 's Daughter . " Marnia ! Those delicate white fingers that had touched his so confidingly . They had torn apart the living bird . And now she had killed Bartu . Bartu , who was his man . " She was angry , master . She came near to the cave . She had seen the airplane . Bartu told her it was your wish that she should not come when those others were here . She smiled . But it was a smile to make the heart afraid . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a willful brook which turns this way and that but goes always on its course . You she would not harm . But Bartu , who was yours . " Shacklcton felt his heart too heavy to make reply . Ile stood a moment when Bimbi had left him . Marnia ! Manna ! What are you ? He felt that he had touched the naked cruelty that is in woman . Marakoff 's words came to him : " If you would achieve , put women from you . What have a woman 's acquisitiveness and heartlessness to do with the work of a man who would acquire knowledge ? " How completely Marakof understood ! How acquisitive , how revengeful , women were ! But not Joan . Joan ! He took the upward path in swift strides . She was still standing by the entrance to the cave . Her eyes were bright with tears . He caught her in his arms . With his lips pressed against her hair he whispered , brokenly : " Joan . . . . Joan ! Do n't ever leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding his sudden inarticulate passion , but only his need of her . On the slope above them a white hand parted the greenery ; Marnia 's face looked down , wondering . But neither Shackleton nor Joan was aware of her .  | TOOLUM130 PIPES " Now , Toolumbo , give me the other . " Toolumbo sprang like a black cricket to the last of the three printing-frames and with one gesture put it in Joan Shackleton 's hand . The sun shone . Bimbi , kneeling on a leopard skin , was combing and brushing it with frowning care . Toolumbo stood watching Joan devotedly . He would have liked to offer his service in a dozen ways , but was afraid of overdoing it and receiving one of Bimbi 's black looks . Joan liked having him there . Toolumbo always added a note of whimsicality  --  yes , and a certain soundness  --  to every situation . Toolumbo was a pinch of salt . She continued now to give her careful attention to the printing of Shackleton 's films . Once she looked up from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ? Then she turned resolutely from that thought and busied herself once more with the printing-frames . " Why , " said Toolumbo , his head on one side , and digging one of his great toes into the earth ? " why do you call me Little Cricket ' ? I would prefer to be called Buffalo . ' " " By and by , perhaps , " said Joan , smiling , " when you are older . But now I call you Little Cricket because you  | are now here , now there , and you pipe . Go and pipe to me now . " Toolumbo ran and perched on a log , drew his feet up till his knees looked like those of a black cricket , and began to pipe shrilly on his little five-note pipe . " Softly , " said Joan , for she wanted to think . Toolumbo raised one slim finger and shook it at the pipe . " Softly ! " he said , scolding it . Then he began to play little faint notes , very shadows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continued her work . Many of Shackleton 's films could wait for later development , but the films of the Yellow Ape he had developed at once . Now , when he had gone to keep his appointment with Marakoff 's daughter , Joan was more than ever eager for work with which to busy her hands that her thoughts might not be too busy , and , fittingly , there was the printing of the films . Beside the definite occupation it gave her there was the comfort , too , of being of practical use to Ned . Joan slipped the brass press-pieces one after the other , took the prints out deftly , glanced to see that they were sufficiently dark , and put more paper into the frames . Then she bent to look at the prints . In the first , Somba , Marakoff 's great beast , looked out at her . She had peered at the film over Ned 's shoulder when he had first developed it ; had followed and translated the shadows into light , and the light spots into shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature 's bulk . But here the Ape had , it seemed , stepped out of the shadows purposely to face her . Equally horrified and fascinated , she identified all that Ned had told her of it ? its impressive mass , its great , bulky body , huge above the  | waist , more slender and manlike below ; its long , powerful arms , its low-set head . It seemed to her that the beast 's eyes summoned and held her attention , would have done so in spite of any wish she might have had to look away . The eyes were just as Ned had described them  --  tragic . She recalled Ned 's report of what Igor had said of the Ape  --  of how Marakoff had wakened the soul of the Ape  --  her thought ran on as she gazed  --  and how , in a like manner , he had kept asleep the soul of Marnia . The Ape 's soul seemed to look out at her now , terribly , enquiringly . That profound gaze seemed to be saying to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torment of loneliness and separation . Why are you and the man you love here ? Is that , too , by the will of MarakofT ? " She put down the photograph . A fantastic fear swept through her . MarakofF ! Always Marakoff ! Why had she let Ned go to meet with MarakofT 's daughter ? Why had she not dissuaded him ? She glanced at 13imbi still glossing the leopard 's skin , and remembered Bimbi 's name for Marnia ? " t he Devil 's Daughter . " What dark treachery might lie in that meeting ! But no ! She must not think of such things . It was unworthy of Ned and of herself . She reached for the second print and pressed it back with slightly trembling fingers . That was better ! In it the great beast , like a careful Caliban , was carrying a gourd of water to Marakoff 's daughter , half reclined on a rock , waing for him to bring it . When she and Ned had looked at the film together , Ned had said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleness and carefulness in every line of Somba . There 's the whole thing ! There 's race history ! The whole animal  | gdnm , brute force , in subjection to man ! My God ! hat a mind Marakoff had ! " Yes , all that was true . She was clear enough and fair ough to see it and admit . it . The girl , so beautifully utnan , waited on by the great brute . Shackleton had said , ike Shakespeare  --  Caliban and Miranda  --  only better than Shakespeare , " his phrase came back to her now . ? Pretty nearly God . " Then her thought swerved , like a bird on the wing , and turned toward home . Her lips smiled . She saw the future as she wanted it to be , as she believed it would be . Some day at a scientific meeting , before a distinguished and interested audience , that picture would be thrown upon a screen . The audience would go wild with enthusiasm . There would probably even be cries of : " Shackleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leopard skin to his own great satisfaction . When it gleamed like the sun , and infinitesimal rainbows shone in every hair , he would carry it into the cave and spread it on the fresh boughs he had brought for Joan 's bed . Toolumbo , tired of playing only shadow notes , took the pipe from his lips , focussed it on Bimbi , squinted one eye , and with the other looked down its stem with the gesture of an admiral . Other pictures of home flashed happily across Joan 's mind . " Bimbi , " she said , " it is wonderful to be here is n't it , but it will be wonderful to be back again , too . " She saw , whimsically , Aunt Leila clapping her hands twice , the old summoning gesture , and Bimbi appearing as of old , severe , tall , efficient , bearing the tea tray at twilight at Cranbrook , and the firelight shining on the silver . " Little Spear , " Bimbi stopped his smoothing and comb-  | ing of the leopard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strange things in this Valley , but more yet in the heart of man . " " I will tell you something , " said Toolumbo , who had an almost automatic tendency to leap into every possible opportunity for conversation , " I had a grandmother " Bimbi shot him a scornful glance . " Bawashla ! Fool Little Spear , he never had a grandmother . He grew on a tree like a palm nut , with nothing but powder inside him  --  no meat ! " " Is that so ? Then how does it come ... " " Do not pour talk , empty one ! " Toolumbo took a sidewise leap and landed nearer to Joan . " May I have my say , 0 You ? " Joan turned to smile at him . Toolumbo grinned and took a step nearer Bimbi , dragged one foot mockingly and raised and lowered his shoulders ; but the whites of his eyes were anxious and watchful , nevertheless . " Then how does it come , Son-of-a-Chief , that I have found a name and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What name have you found , Toolumbo ? " " I have found ! I have found ! I lay it here on this stone for you . " He made a gesture of disposal . " Bimbi will not let me call you Little Spear  --  that is his name . He says it is not fitting , so I closed my eyes and I said , O , spirit of my grandmother , ' and my grandmother said , You shall call her " Flower of the Gourd . " Like the sacred vine and like its sacred flower ; for when the time comes she , like the sacred gourd , gives comfort " ' Bimbi rose . There were moments when he called Toolumbo " worthless worm , " but who could say what spirits might not be watching over Toolumbo ? Could so  | little an insect have thought of so perfect a name all by himself ? " It is enough , " Bimbi said . " It is fitting . It saves your bones from being broken . " Toolumbo flashed a laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a few dance steps , then put his pipe to his lips and began blowing his five airy notes . " Little Cricket , " said Joan , with pretending severity , " I like the name you have given me , but go now and sit on the log and say nothing . " " May I pipe ? " " Yes , you may pipe . " Bimbi carried away the leopard skin . Toolumbo , on the log , his feet crossed one over the other , shrilled softly . Cleopatra from under the shade of the log looked up at him , enjoying the sounds . " This means , ' I come , ' " he said , paying no attention to her . Then he blew four direct announcing notes . " This means ( Beware . ' " He blew three quick staccato notes . " This means , ' What is in the pot  --  sorrow or comfort ? " ' All five notes , one after the other , took flight in a little upward wail . Joan took up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of Marakoff 's daughter . The same beautiful face of the angered girl who had so startlingly faced them all , but not angry now . She remembered what Ned had told her of Marnia 's startling likeness to Marakoff . It seemed to her now that Marakoff looked out at her from that dark , level , direct gaze . Yesterday , when she had first seen the girl , she had wondered why Ned had not told her how marvelously beautiful Marnia was . Looking into the picture , she wondered anew why he had not said more about it . She had  | never seen such exquisite , compelling beauty . She remembered the unforgettable beauty of Dornia Eleutherios , but this ! The girl 's imperious eyes looked straight into hers , deep and steady and searching . Shackleton had said that Marnia was a child . Yes  --  a child , of course , yet not a child  --  a child with ages in her , ages back of her . To Joan that gaze seemed old as the planets are old , young as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling longer to endure the gaze of Marakoff 's daughter ! " Arc you learning them ? " Toolumbo said , jealous of her attention . " This one says , What is in the pot  --  sorrow , or comfort ? ' " Ile blew again the five notes  --  a little upward , wailing flight of them .  | Chapter Fifteen UNDER GREEN BOUGHS SIIACKLETON 'S heart swung heavily . Marakoff 's daughter did not come forward to meet him . She waited for him imperiously . She stood under the green boughs of a great spreading pomegranate tree . So intent was he on the lines and beauty of her that he did not at first get more than a passing impression of the tree , but as he approached , he saw that it was in its way as beautiful and distinctive as Marnia herself . Its broad , thorned branches were thick with masses of lance-shaped leaves . Between these showed great globes of pale scarlet marked with splotches of deeper colour . The identity of it came to him with a rush of memory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she stood under its boughs her face was like a mask , still and almost unearthly in its loveliness . There was a slight scornful drooping of the eyes . Was it only his fancy or did a kind of definite power emanate from her stillness and her beauty ? She raised her eyelids slightly . " You are not afraid of me ? " The words put Shackleton on his feet . He laughed . " Afraid of you ? Certainly not . Why should I be ? " She held out her two hands , with a little smile . " You do not hold that against me  --  that I killed your Bartu ? " Her fingers closed tight and a little cold over his .  | " You would not hold that against me . No , you would not . " There was a slight note of appeal in her voice . Shackleton met her direct gaze with as direct a one . " It was a dastardly thing to do . " The lines in his face were severe . " What else would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She released his fingers suddenly . She seated herself at the foot of the tree and made a haughty gesture that bade him seat himself near her on the soft sward . He obeyed it . She folded her hands and let them lie in her lap . She devoted her full direct gaze to him . When she spoke it was with a strange mellowness . Ile remembered afterward , reviewing it all , that her voice had sounded to him as soft as that of a wood pigeon and almost as mournful . " I have lived here always with Igor , " she said , " only Igor . Then you came to the Valley . " Ile found it almost difficult to listen to what she said , for noting the loveliness of her , the exquisite contour of her head . Lines from an old Italian sonnet he had once known came to his mind : Sapphire nor diamond nor emerald Nor other precious stones past reckoning , * * * * * * Is half so excellently gladdening As is my lady 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn  --  defiantly it seemed to him  --  shone against the heavy dark hair that undulated away from the singularly white forehead . She paused and began playing with the stem of a flower in the grass beside her . He still gazed at her as though under a spell .  | " When you have finished looking at me ? " she said , sweeping her glance back to him . " I am waiting for you to continue , " he said . He drew his gaze away from her and in his turn busied himself with a blade of grass . " Only Igor , you see , " she went on , " and then  --  you came to the Valley . I did not ask you to come . That is not my fault  --  that you came . But  --  since you came  --  of course , I wanted to see you . Is it strange that I wanted to be with you ? Picture to yourself the nights and the days . I know the stars the way you know people 's faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had seen only people , never a star . Or suppose all your life you had lived in a cave and had never seen a star . And then , one evening , at twilight , some one led you out , and there it was ? the evening star . Would you stay and look at it ? When evening came again would you wish to see it again , or would you return to your cave and act as though it had not appeared ? Would you go again to see it ? And if you did , would anyone say you spied upon it ? " " Yes , I understand , " said Shackleton , humouring her . " I am not offended that you wished to see me . But I think of Bartu . . . " " It is not reasonable that you should blame me , " she said , quickly . " That day I wished to see those who came out of the sky to see you , and the black fool " ? she shot an angry glance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what he calls you ? ' says you are not to come , ' so I was angry with you , of course . Igor never crosses me . But you ! You , the one I have just found . . . . " Her eyes , full of a smouldering indignation , burned on him a moment , like the eyes of an imperious , angered woman ; but almost at once the inconsequent ,  | frank childlikeness was back again . " So I said , ' I will take away the one he likes and depends on . ' " She threw away the flower with which she was playing as though the argument were ended . Shackleton leaned forward . " My dear , " he said , evenly , watching her closely , " you can not go on like that with me . With Igor ? Yes , perhaps . Not with me . I am different . " She smiled and held out her hands to him , palms up . His every sense was aware of her . How exquisite she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was as though her body were an instrument and its least movement music . She tilted her head back slightly and her look dreamed at him under lowered eyelids . " Different ! Different ! " her voice dreamed , too . " That is it precisely , " she said . " You are different . And the world is different  --  now . There ! " She clapped her hands like a pleased child . " Now we have agreed . You are different and you will not hold anything against me . That is splendid . We shall be friends , better friends than Igor and I because " ? again she clapped her hands , then clasped them together and held them against her lips , an exquisite gesture , and spoke across them softly , her eyes fixed on him ? " you are different . " Shackleton drew himself away from the spell of watching her and from the awareness of every line of her loveliness , so young , so old , so childlike , so woman through and through . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked down where it had hung . " No . Igor asked me for it . He wants to keep it . " Shackleton made no reply . Instead he let his attention dwell on this part of the Valley new to him , and lovelier , r he thought ; even than his and Joan 's first sight of it from  | the Ledge . Here there was something markedly gracious and idyllic . Spreading from the pomegranate tree and the green slope it stood on , the lines of the land reached out in graciousness , attaining on one side the silver , wandering stream , and on the other a grove of baobabs , diolas and rosewoods . Across the space between , a flock of flamingoes , as many as a hundred or more , moved in slow , leisurely fashion , like gorgeous flowers blown forward unwillingly here and there , at intervals , by a wind without sound . Shackleton 's eye roved from one thing to another , hungrily aware of the uninterrupted beauty . " Is it like England ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " No , not like that . Everything is different there . But it is beautiful , too . There is the Spring that you do not have here . " " Tell me about it . Igor has told me about the Spring in Moscow . " He told her , describing the witchery and the beauty of the English Spring . Then his eyes followed again the tropic growth , the gracious masses of doum palms , then a group of trees beyond , whose name Ned did not know , bent with their burdens of globular , scarlet fruit , velvety like sumac ; then , farther on , to a group of three dark gundy-guli trees with their large , green fruit , like oranges . Suddenly the air was alive with wings . A flock of egrets , hundreds of them , alighted on the boughs of these trees and the boughs were changed as by some power of sorcery and enchantment , and became white with the birds as with snow ; snowy white as with blossoms . He leaned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ! In England  | there is a tree white like that . It is white with fragrant flowers  --  the hawthorn . " " The hawthorn ! " she said , repeating it after him . He watched the suddenly enchanted trees . It was as though some listening power had said to him , " I have done this for you so that you may show her what the hawthorn is like , and after that she will never cease to , I want to go with you . " Though he did not look at her , he was acutely aware ij of her beauty  --  beauty such as he had never seen before . NI She should have been clad in samite . The romance-loving 1i boy in him  --  that is in every man  --  had , like Siegfried , suddenly tasted dragon 's blood . Ile felt that he saw and heard life with new realizations . Iti ' " You will see , " he said , still not looking at her , but conscious of her nearness as sound is sensed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will jj see what it is like in England in the Spring . " y ; ! Suddenly , as he spoke , the egrets lifted their myriad wings , spread them multitudinously , rose and soared , tak ' 1dY ing with them in a silver cloud the impression of snowy IYI blossoms , wheeled with it , played with it , interwove it in their flight , it seemed , and carried it away with them . Again it seemed almost that he had witnessed some enchantment . The gundy-guli trees were now as they had been . They bore no white blossoms . They showed only their large , almost sinister , green fruit , as before . Above them he saw what he had not noticed before  --  a slender C I stretch of greenish cloud . " Is there rain in that cloud ? " he said . " No , " she answered him , " only perhaps wind . " He watched it for a moment . When he turned toward N her again she had risen . She had reached up white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the boughs above her . She loosed it easily from its stem . " There is no Spring here , " she said , bringing it to him , " but these are good to taste and good for those who thirst . Igor has a foolish name for the pomegranate which means banishment-of-longing . ' Break it for me . " He took it from her and almost without will of his own broke it . Igor 's name for it , " Banishment of longing " ? and she , of course , not dreaming what that meant . Immediately she put the rim of the half he gave her to her lips and sipped the slightly acid juice . " Drink of it , too , " she said , and herself drank again . He did as she bade him . Again he had a sense of strangeness and enchantment , as though he had in some other existence lived through this before . " Sometimes , " she said , setting the fruit aside , " I feel strange powers in me , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am I a foolish woman ? " " You are not a woman , " he said , evenly . " You are a child . " She smiled at him . " No . Truly I am not . " He wanted to say : " You are neither child nor woman ; you are a creature of strange powers . You are a belle dame sans merci ! You are nothing that any man of flesh and blood should follow or have anything to do with . " Instead , he rose and said , almost abruptly , almost sharply : " You promised that you would take me into the Inner Valley  --  the Valley of Creeping Men . " " Yes , " she said , brightly , " and I will . But if I do this for you will you give me what I want ? " " What do you want ? " he said . " What shall I give you ? " She kept her eyes almost childlikely on him .  | " I want you to give me what you gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day when the black fool , Bimbi , told you of Bartu 's death . You came back to her , you took her in your arms , i Shackleton remembered the whole passionate moment ! II when his need of Joan had been so great . " I was there , " Marnia continued . " You did not see and she did not , but I was there above the cave , hidden . I saw . " ypyp Shackleton 's mind waked to its old alertness . She was 11 neither spirit nor fairy nor belle dame sans merci . She was flesh and blood ; human enough , as he was . But above all , she was Marakoff 's daughter . Of the human emotion of j love she knew nothing and must know nothing . Igor 's 9+ ' ' account passed through his mind . He knew that nothing must awaken the sleep of Marnia . She was a child , and 1 , her childlikeness must be kept  --  not only because of Marakoff  --  what had Marakoff to do with Shackleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment came to him as though Marakoff had laid a hand on him . He must get into the Valley ; he must keep himself clear of the enmity of Igor . Ile must beware of the Yellow Guardian . All these things brought him to a sudden decision . " Will you give me what I want ? " she asked . " That ? Oh yes , " he said , with nonchalance , as if it were nothing . He stooped and , while she stood rigid , put a light kiss on her lips . She took it without surprise or emotion . " That is not what you gave her , " she said . He hated himself for having tricked her . He would have liked to make good the meanness ; would have liked to take her in his arms as one comforts a child whom one has deceived . Instead , he spoke to her as a wise and  | tolerant grown-up speaks to a child who has yet everything to learn of life . " Little sister , let me tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other woman . I can give her what I can not give you . You are two and different . Different as the sun and moon . " She caught at that . " Am I the moon ? " He did not answer . Then it was suddenly as though she abandoned her purpose . She turned abruptly . " What you want is yonder . Behind that great rock is the entrance to the Inner Valley . Come , let us go . Follow me. "  | Chapter Sixteen TREASURE OF MARAKOFF SHE stepped forward with quick , sure step . Shackleton followed . Behind the great rock whose brilliant peacock colours ? green and blue and bronze  --  suggested to Shackleton fancifully a jewelled portal , they followed a small opening that widened in a few moments to a narrow canyon-like cleft between the two walls of solid stone rising on both sides . Shackleton could have touched both walls with his outstretched hands . For several hundred yards the canyon twisted and turned on itself . Marnia paused to look back at him . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulphur , " she said . " Do not mind it . It comes from a spring at the head of this canyon . It guards the Inner Valley like a giant . None of the apes  --  except Samba ? will ever go near it . Because he is more like human beings he is not afraid of the odor . " In Shackleton 's mind , memory and experience threw back to a happening in his own life in America when he was a boy . He was riding a little roan mare at the White Sulphur Springs in West Virginia , and she was curvetting and refusing to go near the Sulphur Spring , and Shackleton , boylike , was trying to force her . Then the mellow voice of the old darky attendant : " Watch out thar , boy !  | She 'll break yo ' neck ! Yo ' cai n't fo'ce a ho'se so close to snip huh ! " So that was why the Black Apes did not come into the outer Valley . He had figured out that the fires along what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reason that they never emerged , but he had wondered why they might not make their way out through the lower entrance . Here was the reason . At that moment Marnia raised her head and called . Her voice was curiously gentle , but unmistakably commanding . " Somba ! " When the Yellow Ape came , she kept her eyes on it and , putting her hand on Shackleton , she said : " He and I are going into the Valley . You will guard us both . You will let no harm come . " She continued to keep her eyes on the Ape a moment more , with a look that reminded Shackleton of Marakof , as though impressing some brightness of command on the sensitive dimness of the beast 's mind , then she released him from her glance . He turned obediently and led the way . Marnia held out her hand in a slow , lovely gesture of invitation to Shackleton , as though bidding him to some feast . He followed , fascinated . They crossed on a slight rock bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face in her arm , the need of shutting out its almost overpowering odor . Then on , a few yards more , and the canyon opened abruptly to the actual bowl of the Inner Valley itself . Shackleton 's heart beat hard . At last ! Yes , at last ! and with Marakoff 's daughter beside him , he stood in the actual Valley of Creeping Men . His first impression was of a dark , Dantesque grimness.  | On all sides rose bare , black cliffs , basalt and of volcanic origin . They rose and towered gigantically . The chief vegetation visible was a low , cactus-like growth that clutched with grey fingers the base of the black rocks . Shackleton recognized it as the tropical cactus known as 11 milk-poison , whose grey , fleshy stalks , when cut , gave off a viscid , deadly juice . Rising here and there above this low growth , occasional groups of trees lifted themselves . They had shiny , scaly , serpent-like trunks and branches , 1 and a foliage of a green so deep as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was enveloped and sunk , it seemed , in a horrible sinister stillness , seemed to ShackII leton alive , as though , without eyes , it nevertheless watched ; and without hearing , it listened and waited . The Ape paused patiently and cast his glance , under raised eyebrows , up and around . Marnia turned and stood like a pleased child with her I ' clasped hands at her lips , and over them watched Shackleton 's fascinated interest . " 1 ) o you like what I have shown you ? " she said . Ile turned his eyes for a moment to her . " Yes , daughter of Marakoff . " Then his glance went back searchingly to the dark , waiting scene surrounding them . He could see now , observing more closely , that the iii black cliffs rising about them were honeycombed with caves . The openings had appeared to him at first like mere shadows or spots of darker strata . Now he began to see , almost to sense rather than to see , dim movement in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though life were moving crawlingly in them , like maggots that move in matted masses . Then suddenly , yet slowly and deliberately , they were maggots no more . There emerged slowly from the caves  | in the cliffs , curiously and enquiringly , the great black heads and arms and bodies of apes . Shackleton 's mind leaped to identify them . These were they that chattered ! T hey emerged to look . They leaned to look . They stooped to look . They bent their great heads between high shoulders to look . Huge creatures ! As black as the cliffs ! I Iundreds of them ! Marnia , standing beside Shackleton , put a light hand on his arm . " Do not be afraid of them , " she said , smiling a little scornfully . The Yellow One , waiting , licked his lips with a slow speculative tongue and blinked his great eyes twice . He let his glance rove over the cliffs idly , as though none of this really interested him . It seemed only that he waited for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing worth his interest . The Black Apes leaned lower and , almost it seemed in unison , bent angry and flaming eyes on Shackleton and Marnia . Suddenly , as though it were the expression of a feeling shared at the same instant by all of them , their lips drew back slowly over white teeth and fangs . Then , like the rushing of intolerable waters , there barked and swirled and resounded against the hollowed cliffs a deafening roar , a myriad-mouthed snarl , that shook the air and reverberated  --  Black Ape thunder ! Marnia , almost at the same moment , raised an imperious hand in signal to the Yellow Ape . Samba took a step toward the Black Apes and , raising his great arms toward them , gave a long and terrible cry of menace and command . " Ooo-mm ! Ooo-mm ! Ou-mm ! Ou-mm ! " As though the cry had struck not only on their ears ,  | but had beaten nakedly upon their bodies , they crouched and shrank and backed away into the caves and disappeared , all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great head was grizzled . He still kept his teeth bared and , half-concealed in his cave , glared down menil acingly at them . 1 Somba gave one more cry : " Oum-m ! " The great black beast vanished . Marnia spoke a word to Somba , who turned and led them farther into the Valley . Then she put her hand on his arm and signalled that he was to stay where he was . Shackleton watched her every movement and glance . Not only her features , but her very manner , her imperiousness  --  how like Marakoff ! One of the observations in Marakoff 's notes came back to him : " Men woo kind and tender women . These only minister to a man 's weakness . The man who would achieve seeks in woman qualities auxiliary to his own  --  imperiousness , power , ruthlessness . " He had thought , when he read that , how wrong Marakoff had been and how embittered probably by his own experience with women , yet as he watched Marnia now , he could admit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her every gesture and manner were saying , without knowing that they said it : " Here are such power and beauty and ruthlessness as Marakoff had in mind . " The Yellow Ape cringed . His eyes begged her to allow him to go with her . She made a quick gesture of anger , then held her hand to Shackleton , bidding him follow her .  | At a short distance ahead the rather narrow passage between the cliffs spread out . She offered him her hand . " Close your eyes for a moment . I want to surprise you . I will lead you . " When , at her bidding , he opened his eyes again , she stood watching him with her familiar gesture of joy , her head slightly bent , her lips touching her clasped hands . She waited for some expression of his pleasure . I le said nothing , only allowed his eyes hungrily to take their fill . Before him , in a large open space , spread and towered the black ruins of a vast temple , massively broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked . The irregular pillars , broken and overthrown , had yet the dignity of their form and their massiveness . Three of them in a row , joined by a heavy black cornice , still stood upright . As Shackleton gazed at them their irregularity took on meaning and coordinated into the forms of huge stone apes . The heads , bent back and up , rested against the upright mass of stone , and the arms , uplifted narrowly , ended in great ape hands that must originally have upheld the temple 's roof . An ape-temple of black stone , black as the cliffs ! An ape-temple whose pillars were apes ! This was Marakoff 's world ! Marakoff 's Valley ! Marakoff had stood here where he , Shackleton , now stood , and had looked on these things . A lost civilization , who could say how old ! A lost people , no doubt ape-worshippers ! A worship rooted , as man 's own life was rooted , in brute things . Shackleton went nearer , forgetting the girl beside him , though she watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he kept his on the great temple ; reading him as he read this that stood mutely before him . On one side , the wall of the temple , open to the sky , was carved in crude and massive bas-reliefs softened and in places almost obliterated by time , but still articulate and unmistakable . Here a band of great apes bent , bringing burdens that might have been sacrificial fruit . Here was the figure of a man very tall in stature and , to judge by the shape of the head and features , of the white race , who wore a crown and who , from the straight folds of what might have been a priestly robe , held his hands out as though leading the apes or performing a part of some ceremony . What strange and lost people had built this temple ? Marnia seated herself on one of the great blocks of basalt and waited for Shackleton , her chin in her hands . Shackleton , stepping from one prostrate column to another , caught a moment 's glimpse and remembrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes , Marakoff 's eyes were on him . The other world , outside the Valley , in which he had lived and worked and attained , seemed to him infinitely remote and unimportant and unreal . This was reality , this broken but magnificently significant past in which he and Marakoff 's daughter were alone . He built up in imagination the story of the lost people . It seemed to him clear that they had held the ape sacred . It seemed to him they must have believed that the ape was their ancestor and for this reason had revered it . That the ancestor worship of the African of today was deeply , even though hiddenly , rooted in this profounder ancestor worship , seemed to him sure . The carvings left him no doubt that the lost people had sacrificed to the apes some of their women , at what must have been an acknowledged ape-festival . Here , no doubt , was the be-  | ginning of that race of which the Yellow Guardian was now the sole survivor . All these thoughts swept brokenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation of Marakoff 's study of human and animal psychology . He remembered bits of knowledge left from his old classical training , the dark side of folklore and mythology , the recognition of the close relation , by ancient peoples , between the human and the brute worlds . And doubtless these people who had once lived here and who had made those carvings , these people who had given their women to the apes , had sensed and accepted the fact of their ancient brute beginning . All this recalled to him a striking assertion Marakoff had once made in one of his lectures : " There was a time when man held sacred and significant the ancient , humble brute stable in which man himself was born " Perhaps Marakoff was thinking , as he spoke , of these very carvings and these very people . Just how had this people disappeared from the earth ? IIad the Yellow Apes , the offspring of the human and brute races , led the Black Apes to exterminate the Lost People ? The commanding power of Somba over the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on his wonder . " I wish you to come now , " she said , imperiously . " There is more to do than to look at pillars of overthrown brutes . " He determined to come here again , that he might study the ruins more carefully . " I like watching you , " she said as he came to her . She  | gave him the full , devoted , approval of her eyes . " I thought , as you went about among all these huge overthrown things , how little they seem and how tall you tower " ? she smiled and half-closed her eyes ? " as my father must have towered among them . " " Are there no more traces of the Lost People ? " he said . " Yes , " she said ; " there is their treasure . It lies hidden in that cliff  --  there where the cascade is . It is now my father 's . It is very beautiful . I will take you there . " The treasure of the Lost People ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " who are the treasure of Marakoff , because you show me these things . " She clapped her hands . " There ! That is the way I like you to be ! Let us go ! " As they went , he caught a glimpse of a distance far beyond that was green with the rich greenness of the jungle , hut high-walled , too , by black cliffs . " What is the green there ? " " That ? I call it the Beyond . ' It is the feeding-place of the Black Ones . But why should we think of them ! Come , let us go , and I will show you my father 's treasure . " She swung around , facing him . " I will take you to it if you will give me what I asked you for . " He did not answer . For a moment he forgot what it was that she had asked of him . " We are here you and I , " she said , " in the Valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutes whom Somba will look after . That is what I like . I am tired of Igor and of the other Valley . This is a better world . What does the other matter , and the black fools out there , and the Woman-Who-Came ? What are they ? " She put her hand hesitatingly on his . He drew his own away , everything swimming back into  | his consciousness again  --  Marakoff , Igor , Joan . IIe retnenibered Igor 's words , " Whenever she would have touched me I was to forestall her  --  as when a sleeper is about to waken . " Ile rose and stood before her and away from her , folding his arms as though to hide his hands away from her possible touch . " Little sister , " he said . . . She put her head a little on one side , watching him . A faint smile was on her lips , and her eyelids , slightly drooped , seemed to veil her eyes as though from some brightness of looking on him . The turquoise-blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay like a jewel against the creamy , magnolia white of her throat . What an exquisite , wild , child-creature she was ! Where had he seen that magnolia whiteness before ? Dornia Eleutherios , of course ! From that moment of identity she seemed to him , though still a child , yet a woman  --  and pent up in her all the age-old powers of woman . In this slender , exquisite body were locked the old mysteries  --  woman 's beauty , woman 's inscrutability . Those mysteries fascinated him , called to him  --  had always fascinated and called to him ? as they call to all men ; but he had never seen them so embodied before ; had never stood so close to them . " Why do you look at me like that ? " At that moment there was a slight sound . He lifted his glance above her head , but she did not take her eyes from him . " What was that ? " " In this Valley the rocks fall easily , " she said . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but keeping his eyes beyond her , searching the cliffs from which the sound had come .  | It was then that his glance discovered something which he did not at first identify . It was pinkish and rounded like the strange , five-fingered , fleshy bloom of the wayama plant of the jungle . He had always seen it with dread or revulsion , for the wayama plant always clings to dead and corrupted things . Here it clung , instead , to one of the overturned , great black rocks . Something glinted slightly . The wayama had around its thick stem a band of silver ! Where had he seen that band of silver before ? Then , as though by some black magic of the black rock to which it clung , the fleshy wayama plant changed under his very eyes to a hand , a heavy , short-fingered hand . And the silver bangle ! Of course ! The hand of Schnitter ! It was an instant before Shackleton could accept that . Then it flashed across him . Of course ! Schnitter , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed . Schnitter knew the way into the Valley . Schnitter must have heard of the treasure . What else could have brought him there ? But that would ! Schnitter was there , not ten yards from them . His foot had no doubt slipped . He had almost lost his footing . He was saving himself now with that powerful hand , and not daring to move lest he be discovered . Shackleton 's first impulse was to have it out with Schnitter , and let go at him then and there , as he deserved . But , no . There must be no altercation with Marnia there . He must get her away quickly . " Marnia , " he said , evenly and in a low tone , lowering his glance to her , " we wo n't talk any more today . You have said I am different from Igor , and I am . You say that is why you like me . To Igor you say ' Come ' and ' Go , ' and he does as you bid . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different and you will like me all the better  | for that . Get up from where you are sitting . Look neither to the right nor to the left , but come with me . " She gloomed a moment , not knowing quite what to make of him . " Come , " he said , severely . " I am waiting . " She rose with an almost pleased look , as though this new mood in him amused her . Then her lips pouted a little . " But the treasure " " That will be for another time . " " You will come with me again ? " " Yes . " Marnia walked beside him . " Go ahead of me , " he said . She did as he bade her . As he went , Shackleton could feel the eyes of Schnitter on his back . Somba was waiting for them . Again he gave the long warning cry : " Ou-m-m-m ! " Nothing in the caves of the black cliffs moved . It was as though no hundreds of ape-maggots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so in the lead , his head and shoulders thrust forward . Shackleton , at the entrance to the canyon leading out from the Valley , turned . On the ledge above him and back of him at a little distance , the largest of the apes , the old and grey one , bent and , as though not daring to utter a sound , spoke his spite by flinging a handful of stony earth after them . But neither Somba nor Marnia noticed . Shackleton followed them between the black cliffs , with a quick step .  | SCHNITTER 'S ACE MOBAMBA bent over the evil-smelling smoky brew . She threw in a live toad and watched to see if he would come belly up . There were only her intense silence and watching and the dank drip of water seeping from the wet sides of the Black Caves , against the constant , sibilant , smothered sound of the cataract outside and above the caves , as it tumbled and foamed . Carstensen , watching Mobamba out of the tails of his jade-green eyes , pressed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mobamba suddenly threw her hands over her head and rocked and swayed and moaned . Carstensen got up , knocked his pipe empty and put it in his pocket , and began walking about . Seafaring man that he was and used to wide winds and open spaces , and the rim of the world , and definite lookedfor ports ahead , Carstensen had found the dark and confinement of the Black Caves oppressive , not less than the uncertainty and the waiting . These seemed somehow to humiliate him and to take his profession from him . He would infinitely have preferred a typhoon and all hands to the yards . " What dam ' port do you think you 're trying to make ? " was a thing he had said to Schnitter several times . The only time Schnitter had replied to that , he had  | rammed his hands into his pockets and jingled the small coin and rubbish there a little viciously , and had said : " If you do n't think that half a share in Marakoff 's treasure is worth stayin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Bonnie Bess , you and your dam ' old black mountain ! I would n't stop you ! I did n't want her along , anyway ! " Well , that was problematical . If it came to Carstensen hauling in the gangplank , so to speak , casting loose , and taking the black mountain along with him , would Schnitter be so independent , after all ? Was n't his scorn of them only a pretence ? There had been moments when Carstensen would have liked to try it out . What could Schnitter alone do toward capturing the treasure ? But " something in the rigging " told him that if he did that , Schnitter might let him and the black woman depart without protest , and then armed with what information he had collected from them , he might sell himself and the information to his former employer , Shackleton , and so sail off with some of Marakoff 's treasure , after all . No , better stand by . Nevertheless , damn the darkness and the dankness of the cave , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes red , and the waiting ! He had an added sense of bitterness , and injustice , too , when he reviewed the good service he and the black woman had already rendered . His own signal service had been the discovery of Igor and Marnia . He had gone into the Valley one night and had spied to find out what he could . He had followed the light of a fire that he supposed to be Shackleton 's . Instead , on stealing nearer , he had had what he called the biggest " stove-in " of his life . He had seen the girl 's face . The fire-  | light , shining direct on it , had left him no doubt . Those clear features were so startlingly like Marakoff 's that he jumped . Why in hell should a girl looking like Marakoff be here ? Then his mind clumsily added the two and two  --  this must be Marakoff 's daughter . As to Igor , Carstensen took it for granted that he was the girl 's husband . But why  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Valley ? Then he added another two and two . The pomegranate , of course ! Marakoff had left these two to guard his treasure , and that accounted for the pomegranate . The pomegranate was to say  --  just as Schnitter had guessed there at Madame Martin 's  --  that the treasure was safe . As to Mobamba , even in the few days they had been in the Caves , Mobamba had served them well and had fetched information of indisputable value . He knew it would be fatal for her to see the girl who looked so much like Marakoff , so he used his old dodge and told her that Marakoff had told him to tell her she was not to go on that side of the Valley , but she could spy elsewhere all she wanted to . And was n't it she who , with her sneaking creature ways , had found out where Shackleton 's camp was ? his and Schnitter had licked their lips over that and had leaned and clasped congratulating hands over the flat , ledge-like stone that served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a dangerous mess when she had crept up in the firelight one night and killed one of Shackleton 's men  --  that night she brought home the antelope 's horn amulet full of blood . But you had to take chances like that with her . I ter purpose was all right and shipshape enough in her own eyes . She had a good tight idea that that Valley was hers . Well , it was for them to reef her sails , explain to her , threaten her , that was all .  | As to further explorings , Mobamba needed no prompting or urging . Led by hidden memories of which they had but slight conception , she left them mainly at night , but sometimes in the day as well , to prowl about , as an animal returns to prowl around its old haunts . There was no hastening her about any of her contributions , but Carstensen knew her moods pretty well . When she hung her massive head and swayed it from side to side , as wearied and caged animals sometimes do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times he went close to her , and in a terrible whisper close to her ear would shout : " Out with it . Yare ! Yare ! Do you want me to bring Marakoff here ? Out with it ! " Then Mobamba would turn her terrible hands outward as though warding off an unbearable blow . They were massive black hands and wrists springing from wide fleshy arms . The fingers were webbed together halfway up their length , and the great palms beneath them were a startling incongruous rose-pink . It had taken Schnitter a day or two to get used to Mobamba 's hands , though Schnitter , as he liked to say of himself , was n't squeamish . Then , facing those hands , Carstensen would stand with legs apart in front of her while she rolled her great body , muttering , from side to side , like a derelict hulk in a rough sea , and he would wait there for the smothered scream like that of a released tormented spirit which always preceded her utterings . They were not always clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had brought him most important news yesterday , which he had n't given away to Schnitter , namely , that one of Shackleton 's men was Niamkala , the very native who had delivered the pomegranate to Carstensen each year . No , he had n't given that away to Schnitter yet . He did n't  | quite know how he himself could use it , but kept it like treasure to bring out at the right moment . Today Mobamba 's mutterings on her return from one of her expeditions were clear enough . She always called Schnitter the " fat pig , " so there was no mistaking her . She had been to the Inner Valley . She never named it , but drew a sign for it on the floor in front of her and bowed down to it three times as to an idol . Today she had pointed to the sign and said , mutteringly : " Fat pig ! " Carstensen was used to interpreting her . He leaped to his interpretation . He seized one of her wrists , " What d'ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible threat . " Steady , " he said , forcing himself to be quiet lest she lapse into one of her trance-like silences from which it was so difficult to rouse her . " Steady . You saw the fat pig in the  --  - I lc pointed to the sign . " That 's it , is it ? Eh ? Old woman ? Eh , old Matey ? " She gave a kind of howl and wrenched away from him . He knew that , too , for her sign of acquiescence . When she had no resistance or denial to offer she always gave that low howl , and retreated . Carstensen did n't want to trouble with her after that or think of her again . He had other matters to occupy him . " That 's all right , " he said , soothingly . " Here , I 'll fix your fire for you and here 's your pot . I 'll go fetch you one of the frogs that live in this dean ' hole . " He left the chamber of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of its hind legs . " There you are ! " he said , in his pleasantest , heartiest voice  --  the tone used by a man who brings home a goose  | for dinner . " Go about your voodoo business . I wo n't hinder you . Cook up whatever dam ' stuff you like , to see which way the wind 's blowing . Jannie wo n't have a word to say ag'in ' it . It 's all up to the missus . That 's the way it orter be ! God bless our home ! " Like a great , black , bewildered child she seemed grateful for his tone and began at once rekindling the low fire under the pot . Carstensen left her to her witch doings , got his pipe lighted suppressedly , went to the outer chamber of the cave where there was a bit of light reflected from the steps leading up the flume , and waited . So that was it ! He never felt altogether at home with landlubbers , no more than with guns . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of Schnitter . Now he knew him for what he was . Schnitter had stolen a march . Schnitter had cut across his bows ; Schnitter had been into the Valley without him , without him , Carstensen , mind you ! Him , who had brought the voodoo woman along ! ? without him ! He held the reed stem of his cob pipe between his teeth so viciously that , had it been clay , it would have broken . So that was it ! His jade-green eyes blazed bluely through the pipe 's smoke . Yes , so that was it ! Schnitter was trying to get next to the treasure  --  and without him ! Maybe had got next it . Who could tell ? He had not long to wait . He could hear Schnitter 's heavy tread on the steps of the flume . He went back to the inner cave and seated himself . He waited for Schnitter to get fully into the chamber , waited even for him to seat himself at the other side of the stone table . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to see you , mate . I have something I 'm wanting to say to you . " Schnitter sat down and got his pipe from his pocket . " There 's just one thing I 'll ask you " ? Carstensen 's face was already getting red ? " and that 's not to say you have n't been there . " " Been where ? " said Schnitter , looking down his nose at the pipe between his cupped hands , sucking in the flame from the match and releasing it and sucking it in again . The deliberation was the last straw . Carstensen burst into a fury : " Been there without me ! Eh ? Snuck in after the old woman  --  my old woman , ye mind . " He flung a furious look at her , but she was far beyond them both at that moment , bending almost double over her hellish brew . " I brought her here ! If it had n't been for me , where 'd you be now ? I ask you that ? Where 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stow everything tight in the hold  --  foller her in . Yes , that 's the dam ' sneakin ' stowaway stuff . And you and me was to go fifty-fifty on this ! But a bloody beachcomber like you comes along an ' he says , ' Woes the use of dealin ' honest with honest men ? ' " Carstensen nearly choked with indignation and took a fresh start . " Yes , you crep ' up and snuck in ! She calls you " ? he jerked a thumb over his shoulder ? " she calls you fat pig . ' That 's too good a name for you ! ' Big fat sneakin ' pig ' ? that 's better ; or scuttlin ' cockroach ' ; that 's the sort of bilge-water for the like of a hull like you ! " Schnitter 's chin was sunk and his eyes were not on Carstensen , but on a little point of rock at the side of the cave which collected and dripped water , collected it and dripped . It reminded him of his red-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist on her hip and in the other hold a jelly-spoon over a pot of boiling jelly  | juice , watching the juice drip , drip , gauging whether it was thick enough and whether it was time to take the pot from the fire . " I just want to say , " said Carstensen boiling over on all sides , " that I 'm done with you ! Clean outright done with you . Yes , and my old woman is , too ! You 'll see ! " Whether the frog turned belly up or did not , whether Carstensen 's tone struck on some animal sensitiveness in her as a tone strikes sometimes on a dog 's ear and turns into a canine yowl  --  impossible to say ; but the voodoo woman gave a long , throaty , wailing , smothered scream . " You shut up ! " Carstensen flung at her and half rose , as though he meant to leap at her . Then he turned back to Schnitter . " We 're going to let you get on with the apes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look here , when you 've done shooting off your dam ' mouth , " he said , almost goodnaturedly , " I 've got something to tell you . Maybe I did follow her in . Maybe you 're not so dam ' smart as you think you are . " It was as though Carstensen , threatening to explode , decided to wait a moment longer before carrying out the threat . Schnitter watched with shrewd eyes for his advantage and took it . He stepped closer to the ledge that formed their table and tapped the surface softly with the knuckles of the doubled-up fist which held his pipe . He screwed up one eye ; he seemed to be putting his words down heavily , one by one on the table like stones ; or one by one as a man puts down the cards in a superlative hand that he knows beats the deck and by which he wants his opponent and the rest to be duly impressed . " Maybe I followed somebody else in , too  --  somebody  | your damned old hell-cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed Shackleton and the girl ! You know who I mean . Maybe I saw some of their lovemakin ' . under a pomegranate tree . Maybe I saw ' em go into the Inner Valley . Maybe I saw the Yellow Ape lead ' em in . And maybe I knew dam ' well what they were after . Treasure , 11 of course ! And maybe I says to himself , No , Carlie , my boob , you do n't dast follow ' em in . And then maybe  --  I want you to notice this , that I 'm given you full credit for it , d'ye see ? Yes , I 'm givin ' you full credit , though you ai nt dam ' worth it  --  maybe your old woman come along just then , bent on goin ' into the Valley for some of her hell-dour ' with the apes , and maybe , instead of shivering like a rotten barge like you would ' a ' done , I follered ' er in . Yes "  --  his tone changed now and snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees widely apart and his arms on the table , leaned and listened thirstily and with such attention as a man might listen if the sun were to step suddenly out ii of the sky and address him with a voice . Schnitter pressed his advantage : " You know as well as I do we ca n't expect to get in the 11 Valley with Shackleton and his men around , ' specially I I now Shackleton 's got the lady on his side . " His lip curled and he gave a short bark of a laugh . " Oh , he 's got her on his side all right ! She 's sweet on him . If you 'd seen what I seen you 'd know that . " Again Schnitter paused . " Now I 've told you enough , I expect , " he said , " to shut your dam ' mouth . " Carstensen took the rebuke humbly . " So you know where it is , " he said , almost with reverence . " Yes , I do . I could draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple . Remember how your old woman kept muttering about a temple  --  well , it 's there . Then , there 's a path  --  leads right to wot I take to be the cave  --  the cave . " He put his pipe in his pocket . " Guess I 've told you enough for today , and I 've got some more watchin ' and explorin ' up near Shackleton 's camp that I want to do . " He turned toward the flume . Carstensen watched him almost stupidly , the great feet lifting themselves at last up the last visible step , as though some power from above pulled them up , and after that only the heavy sound of their going . Carstensen had drunk more rum that day than usual , and his mind was dull even as the cave itself was hazy , but he was still able to pick out the main points . There was Marakoff 's daughter , and Marakoff 's daughter Schnitter had said was " sweet " on Shackleton . The old woman was rocking now over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be good to get into the sun , out of the dark Caves . A plan began to form itself in his mind . If he met Schnitter and Schnitter said to him , " Where are you off to , Mate , " Carstensen would say , " None of your dam ' business ! " and he would add in his own mind , " When I come back maybe I 'll have something to tell you ! "  | Chapter Eighteen CARSTENSEN TAKES A HAND CARSTENSD:N knew where to go . On that one occasion when he had ventured into the Valley he had found the little path that wound between the two columnar red rocks , then along the base of the cliff through thickets of doum palms to the place where he had seen the man and the girl . Funny their living there . Funny he had never guessed , till he had seen them there , that the pomegranate Niamkala had brought to him each year had been picked by some one who dwelt in the Valley , and carried to the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But that was Marakoff . Once he stood within the Valley , having climbed the flume to the ledge , and then descended the slope , he had a distance of more than a mile to travel along the west side of the Valley until he came to the twin red rocks . The immediate necessity was to keep clear of Shackleton or any of his men . Damn Shackleton ! Because of him he was forced to crouch and stumble ; to play hide and seek in the shadows , to crawl stealthily on hands and knees , peering around jutting edges of rock before venturing into open spaces ; to hold himself quiet and to listen when all his desire urged him on . In that  | way he had made his slow , painful progress . Now he was nearly there . He sank down on a fallen tree and took off his dirty helmet and mopped his brow . He would n't think yet what he 'd say to the young man . You could n't make port till you saw the lights . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run up all the danger signals , and then he 'd watch results . Yes , that was it . That was what he would do . A thin , curling feather of blue smoke betrayed the camp of Shackleton 's men on the opposite side of the Valley . Carstensen smiled a trifle grimly . He 'd given it a wide berth . Mobamba had located it for him , and Shackleton 's own cave not far from it . Trust the old woman for that . She had warned him , too , to keep clear of the treacherous swamp farther up the Valley , where the tree roots coiled and twined about one another , wet and slimy , like writhing snakes . But he 'd no need to go so far . Not today . Yes , Mobamba had been useful . She 'd be more useful . This business was only just begun . He leaned back , resting his hands on his thick thighs . His mind ran ahead . When he got Marakoff 's treasure ! When he had that , Mobamba could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be through with her . Marakoff was dead . He 'd be free  --  and rich . His smile deepened , a smile of slow , intense satisfaction . How much would it be ? Twenty thousand pounds ? Fifty ? Anyway , enough . The London wharves and the ship agents ' offices would know him no more . " So you 're back , Carstensen ! Looking for a berth ? And none too particular , eh ? So long as the Cap'n ai n't particular , either , and there 's a chance for a lively second mate to make something in the poppy trade ? " No more of that . Instead , a villa at Kallundborg , that haven of retired  | shipowners . A handsome , high , brick house with its name painted on the gate posts . And from the parlor window a view of the sea . A rock-cock , teetering self-consciously on its long , rosecoloured legs  --  like a woman walking stiffly on very high heels  --  stepped out of the underbrush , surveyed him provocatively with head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stepped back into the greenery again . And there would be women . .. . 1 But now he must get on . First catch your treasure , Jan , my man . The rest would follow . When he came to the twin needles of red rock , he struck up the path between them . Now for it . A moment later he stopped , alert , every sense on guard . Some one was coming down the slope toward him . Carstensen backed off the path into the thick palm growth . 1 le dropped to his knees , crouched , flattened himself under the palm fronds , an only slightly denser shadow than the shadows round about him . His eyes searched the path . Feet were coming along that path  --  slender , proud , arched feet in leather sandals ; feet that stepped lightly , eagerly , as though hurrying to some wished-for meeting . So it was the girl . Ile raised himself cautiously on his iii elbows , thrusting his face close to the screen of palm leaves , the better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw the flutter of her flame-colour sarong . Good ! If only the man was up above there . He 'd have him alone . He rose , brushed himself clean of the grasses and bits of dry moss , and started up the path . A moment later there came to him , from above , the notes of a flute being played softly . The man was there .  | Thank you , Marakoff ! He stepped heavily and panting a little  --  the climb was steep  --  on to the narrow plateau against the rock wall of the Valley . A mimosa tree grew there . It dropped its racemes of pink blossoms over the entrance to a cave . Outstretched on the grass beneath it lay the flute-player . At sight of the intruder he sprang to his feet . Carstensen came forward and held out his hand . " Pleased to meet you , " he said , with heavy heartiness . Igor made no reply , only stared at him and at the offered palm . " That 's O.K. , " Carstensen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , in a manner of speaking , you and me are pretty near old friends . It was me that for fourteen years carried Marakoff that pomegranate . " Igor started . " That 's all right , " Carstensen said . " Take it slow . I believe myself a man 's got to be careful how he makes friends over the side . I did n't come cruising along here without my articles . Not Jan Carstensen . Here they are . " He leaned forward . " That was n't no ordinary pomegranate . It was splotched , the way pomegranates ai n't . Splotched with somethin ' like blood . " " Ah ! " Carstensen looked around at the seat . " And now I 'll take a seat . With your permission , mister . " He looked around him . Beyond the cave over which the mimosa hung opened another . So this was where those two lived ! A peacock had strutted out on the rock before the second cave . Its proud tail was spread , its myriad eyes winked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wring that bird 's neck if it was his .  | " Did Marakoff send you here to me ? " Igor said . " Well , no , I ca n't say that exactly , " Carstensen replied . " No use lying about things , not when you do n't have to . You see , it was n't but a couple o ' days after I took ! the last pomegranate that Marakoff was murdered . " There was an instant 's terrible silence . Then suddenly Igor lunged at and gripped Carstensen 's thick throat . " You lie ! " Carstensen 's powerful hands wrenched Igor 's away and held them fast . He thrust his face forward . " Steady on , young un . Easy now . I did n't know you did n't know . " Igor recovered himself , but trembled . " It is n't that I did n't know , " he said . " I know differently . " Carstensen stared at him a moment in mute bewilderment . Then the light of understanding broke across his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he never told you Marakoff was dead . And all the time he knew it , " the heavy voice rumbled on , " same as me . He was in London when it all happened . Of course he would n't tell you his friend Marakoff was dead . " He shifted his feet comfortably apart . I le licked his lips . " Listen to me . Marakoff 's got treasure here in this Valley , ai n't he ? And Shackleton knows it . If Marakoff 's dead , ai n't that treasure yours ? Or leastways  --  the lady 's ? And would n't that work in with Mister Shackleton 's plans  --  if Mister Shackleton had come here lookin ' for the treasure himself ? And how do you know Shackleton ai n't sweet on your girl ? Have you seen ' em together ? " Igor 's eyes blazed . There was fury in his voice . " I want you to go ! " he cried .  | " Oh , all right ! Sure ! sure ! " Carstensen spoke soothingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married man myself . I know how you feel . I just want to say , before I go , that I 've got a mate . Him and me are a handy pair . Suppose we could get rid of Shackleton for you , without hurtin ' his skin . Suppose we got him to pick up and go away out of this Valley ? That 'd be of some use to you , would n't it ? That would be worth something to you , would n't it ? I 've lived my life for twenty years on a trader . I think trade 's fair and square . You do n't want to take nothing in this world without payin ' for it ; so if what I 've got to sell looks pretty to you , well , here 's the price . " He hitched himself closer . " You know where Marakoff 's treasure is . Sure you do . You tell us where . We wo n't take more'n our share . We 'll get Shackleton out of the Valley , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Think it over . And if you think we can be of some use , why , I 'm camped , along with that mate of mine , down there in the Black Caves . " He did not wait for a reply . He ducked his head , shoved his hands deep in his pockets , and turned away , down the path . As he went , his mind worked heavily . He 'd get the old woman to win over Niamkala . No matter what that fellow up there decided , they 'd get Shackleton out of the Valley somehow .  | Chapter Nineteen UNQUENCHED FIRE IGOR remained for a long time where Carstensen had left him . Ile stood tense and upright under the feathery mimosa , but all the while he was as one who has been thrown gasping and half drowned upon a sea beach and who lies there , spent and broken , while the thundering surges beat and break upon his defenseless body . Shack leton  --  Marnia  --  Marakoff . Marakoll  --  dead ? Ile could not put that thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . Marakoff , who was to come some day and release him from his vow ; Marakoff , who would say , " Well done ! " Marakoff , who would give him his reward  --  Marakoff not coming ? Never ? lie recoiled sharply from this . A new set of pictures flashed before his mind  --  Shackleton parting the leaves and stepping out before him as he bowed before the name of Marakoff written in the sand ; Shackleton listening , grave and intent , as Igor poured out the story of Mlarakoff 's charge to him and his long years of exile ; Shackleton 's direct statement : " Marakoff sent me . I am here because he wished it . " Were all these things lies ? Was Shackleton mocking him secretly all the while ? No . No . That horrible man with the heavy , scarred hands and the coarse voice and the slow , leering smile ? it was he who had lied . In some way he had learned of  | the treasure that lay in the Inner Valley . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Igor  --  into betraying its hiding-place . He clutched at this thought as a drowning man seizes at a bit of floating driftwood . Of course that was it . Lies ? all lies . Thank God he had revealed nothing . He drew a quick deep breath as he raised his head from the sea of doubt and suspicion and despair . He went presently into the cave and busied himself with a snare he was making . He was intent on his task when a step on the ledge without made him look up . It was Marnia . She stood swaying , hesitantly , one hand reaching up to the mimosa . Its rosy veil enveloped her like a cloud . The sight of her smote him between the eyes . Never had she seemed to him more beautiful , more desirable . " So you 've come back ? " he said . Even to his own ears his voice sounded strangely harsh . But apparently Marnia did not notice this . " Yes , " she said , absent-mindedly . " He did not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was where she had gone  --  to meet Shackleton . She had been waiting for him at some meeting-place all the while Carstensen had stood there where she stood now , and breathed his horrible suggestions . He said slowly , testing her : " Did you want him to come ? So much ? " " Of course I wanted him ! " She spoke without embarrassment , quite simply , as one who states a fact which calls for no comment . Igor bent lower over his snare . His fingers fumbled blindly with the maze of cords . " Why ? " " I wanted to talk with him . His talk is good . Besides ,  | he is my father 's friend . He comes from my father . I wanted to show him more things in the Valley . " He called to his use a cunning he had never suspected he possessed . " Did you mean to take him into the Inner Valley ? " he asked , still without looking at her . " Where your father 's treasure is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , frankly . " The other day . Ile asked me to . . . . " So it was not a lie . On that score at least Carstensen had spoken the truth . But the other . . . the death of Marakoff . . . . He sprang to his feet and threw the half-finished snare into a corner . He came to where she stood by the cave 's entrance . I Es hands went out to touch her shoulders , then drew back . " Marnia , " he said , " I ask you  --  for me  --  to please me " Yes ? " she put her head on one side and regarded him provocatively . " What would please you ? " " Go to your cave . Stay there . " His voice was almost pleading . " The Valley is no longer safe for you . " " You mean because of those black men he has brought ? " And when he did not at once reply she made an impatient gesture . " I am not afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Igor paid no heed to this . " Will you promise me that , Marnia ? " he urged . " For a little while . I would be easier in my mind leaving you . . . . " " Where are you going ? " she demanded . " It does not matter . " But her mind had already leaped to seize on that which she longed to find true .  | " You are going to his cave ? Yes , you are . I see it in your face . I will go with you . " The joy that rang in her voice stabbed him . Now that new-found cunning came to his aid . " I will go and see where he is , " he said , slowly . She clapped her hands . " And you 'll bring him back with you ? Bring him here . Do n't bring her  --  the Woman-Who-Came . Just him . " Igor made no reply . Marnia did not ask for it . She ran lightly along the path to her own cave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated down : " Hurry  --  do ! " He went carefully down the slope and struck across the Valley to the point lower down on the opposite side where he knew Shackleton had his encampment . Soon he would know . He would put his question squarely . " Tell me , " he would say , " you told me Marakoff sent you here . Is Marakoff living still ? " And Shackleton would have to answer with the truth . If not his words  --  at least his eyes or some tremor of the lips would betray him . Igor would know . By the spring he struck up the path Shackleton had had cut , leading toward the ledge on which the cave opened . " Is Marakoff living ? " he would say . And Shackleton would say , " Yes , " and his torment would lift . He was so intent on this that he failed to see in time the quick running , lithe , little black figure which came racing down the slope and ran full tilt into him . Instinctively his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you running to , boy ? " He found the words with difficulty . It was long since he had spoken Bambara  --  the tongue that is used and understood by all the West Coast tribes .  | The boy 's head turned ; the boy 's face , quivering and terrified and with only the whites of his eyes showing , looked up at him . " 0 Spirit-Man " ? Toolumbo spoke very softly ? " do not kill me ! I will put a bowl of rice for thee by the sacred fig tree . Only let me go . I must go to her . " " Go to whom ? " Igor demanded , suspiciously . " To my lizard . Cleopatra , she is called . She has gone from me . " He would have pushed the boy away impatiently , but the new cunning that had taken possession of him made him put one question more : " Tell mc , is he , your master , above there ? " Toolumbo shook his head . " My master is gone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Valley . " He made a wide gesture . " Only Flower-of-the-Gourd is there . And Sonof-a-Chief , who stands by her always . " " Take me there , " Igor said , sharply . Joan , on the ledge before the cave , watching for the sunset glory , was startled to see Toolumbo returning . A changed Toolumbo , with all his mischief quenched , awed now to an unwonted gravity . And following close behind him a figure which she knew at once to be Igor . She came forward to welcome this man whose story , which she knew now in all its completeness , moved her to instant compassion . She held out her hand . " I am glad you have come , " she said , smiling gently . " My husband has told me about you . My husband has gone farther up the Valley . Ile wanted to explore a little beyond the marawong swamp . But he will be coming back soon . " Igor had taken her hand and was holding it . He stood ' ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intentness that made Joan feel rather uncomfortable . " You would not lie to me , " he said , almost solemnly . " There is truth in your eyes . I will ask you " She was thinking what a very strange man this was . Stranger even than Ned had led her to suppose . His face , so tense , so strained , in which his eyes blazed , filled her with vague alarm . " Is my master  --  is Marakoff dead ? " That question ? She had not been prepared for that . For a moment she did not answer , only stared at him as though she had not understood . He repeated it , leaning toward her as though to draw from her the denial he longed to hear . " Tell me . I trust you . Do you know  --  is Marakoff dead ? " In Joan 's mind , the sense of some dire need impelling him to that question battled with the remembrance of Ned 's injunction . " Igor must not know . You wo n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not promised , but he had taken her promise for granted . And now Some evidence of that struggle must have appeared in her face , for Igor cried out suddenly , as though in pain : " Then he is ? " " Yes , " Joan said , a trifle unsteadily , for the look in Igor 's eyes almost frightened her . " Marakoff is dead . " He stumbled as though the confirmation of his fear had dealt him a death blow . He threw up one arm , hiding his twisted and quivering face in the curve of his elbow . Joan caught his other arm . " Do n't , oh , do n't ! " she cried , pityingly . " It is terrible for you , I know . You loved him . Ned has told me . " Oh , if Ned would only come ! How dreadful it was to  | see a man broken like this ! She went on making desperate efforts at consolation . " After all , the death of a friend ought not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must not forget that all that has been fine between you will continue . " Igor did not lift his face from his arm . " You do not understand , " he said . " No . Perhaps not . " She was thinking , as she looked at that bowed figure , how many things there were that she found difficult to understand , among them the extraordinary power that Sergius Marakoff , in his death almost as much as in his life , exerted over human beings . " Perhaps I do n't understand all he meant to you , " she said . " But still I do in a way , too . Marakoff meant a great deal to my husband " At mention of Shacklcton he drew away from her sharply . Joan either did not , or pretended not to , notice this . " Marakoff meant a great deal to Ned , " she went on , " but not everything . You see , there is room for his work ? and for me . " The little smile that played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this to be remembered , too . Now you are free to leave the Valley . You can go back to the world and take up your life there again . There will be work ? things for you to do . " She paused , then added , " and there is Marnia . " " That world ! " He lifted a haggard face . " She and I are not for that world . " " But of course you are ! " Joan was desperately determined to be matter-of-fact . " When you go away from  | here everything will be different , right . You 'll marry . You 'll be happy there . Oh , we 'll help , Ned and I , gladly . " But he pushed the suggestion away with a gesture almost fierce in its repudiation of all that she offered . " No ! No ! " When she would have combated this he made again that desperate , hunted movement  --  the gesture of an animal that has been wounded mortally and fights away those who would succor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die alone . " It is useless . You mean to be kind . But I can bear no more . I must think " As she saw him stumble down the path her heart smote her . She told herself that she should have made him stay . At least until Ned came . Ned would know what to do . She had never seen such grief as this . He was like a man bereft of all hope . Toolumbo 's voice startled her . " I have set the bowl of rice by the sacred fig tree , " Toolumbo said . " The Spirit-Man will eat , and be pleased . O Flower-of-the-Gourd , he will come no more to trouble us . " The sunset glory Joan had looked for did not come . A great ominous cloud , black at the centre , sulphur yellow at its fringe , rose out of the west and swallowed up the sun . Night descended upon the Valley . Not the velvety , pulsing dark that was somehow more alive than the day and in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shrine , but a dense heaviness and deadness , a blackness that was terrifyingly still . Against that dark the flickering glow of the volcanic  | fires within the Inner Valley added hideousness and terror . Then those fires were answered . A long , forked streak of lightning , the tongue of a fire serpent , clove the blackness . It seemed to spring at the Valley with venomous intent . It flashed upon the cliffs and , in startlingly revealed streaks of crimson and ochre and blue , the cliffs replied . Hash to flash across the dark , while the narrow vale seemed to rock under the impact and the snap and crash and boom of the thunder striking across the reverberation of the torrential rain of the tropics , filled it with a deafening uproar . Through that loosed hell Igor fought his way . Deafened and blinded and scourged by the rain , flayed by the whips of the lashing palm branches , he stumbled through the groves . He ran into trees and flattened himself against their trunks , swaying with them in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen logs and stones , only to stagger up , bruised and spent and gasping , and go on , Where he went he knew not . Not to the cave . The thought of Marnia there awaiting him and Shackleton , whom she had commanded him to bring , struck him more harshly than the blows of the storm . The tempest that raged around him was as nothing to the torment that swept across his mind . Marakoff dead . Marakoff not coming . What then ? Marnia . . . Marnia . . . . And Shackleton , knowing that Marakoff was dead , not telling him , deceiving him . Shackleton , hearing his confession and keeping silence . Shackleton being guided by Marnia and the Yellow Guardian into the secret Inner Valley in which he himself had never set foot . Shackleton who had kindled that light in Marnia 's eyes , who had wakened that new tone in Marnia 's voice . . . . There were things no man could endure  --  the wrecking it  | of his lifework ; the sum of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck and destroyed great baobabs . Marakoff 's treasure in the Inner Valley meant little or nothing to him . It was not that treasure Marakoff had set him to guard , but the other , vastly more precious , more desirable treasure  --  Marnia . That treasure in the Inner Valley , at thought of laying a hand on it as Carstensen had suggested , Igor recoiled sharply . Ah , but what right had he not to lay a hand on it if by so doing he could save Marakoff 's richer treasure ? Marnia ? In the Black Caves the tumult of the storm came dully , scarcely more than an echo to the rumble of the cataract that sounded there at all times . Carstensen had spent a long evening retailing to Schnitter the account of his scene with Igor . The two mouthed the story , tasting with relish all its fine points . Shackleton thought himself smart , did n't he ? Not so smart as some other folks . He 'd see . " That fellow Niamkala , " Schnitter said , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Carstensen . " You listen here to me . . . At last Schnitter lighted a torch and stuck it into a crevice of the rock wall . He got out a pack of greasy cards . The two began to play . But Carstensen kept stopping in his game , holding back his king to lead trumps in a larger game . " You 'd ought to have seen him when I said that about the two of them together . Shackleton and his girl . See ? Oh , he 'll come round ! " " What you seem to forget , " Schnitter objected , " is that  | Shackleton 's got forty men with him . They may be blacks , but laugh them off if you can . " " No , I ai n't forgot , Mate . " Carstensen was heavily condescending . " I 'll talk to you about that later , maybe . Forty niggers arc " he paused significantly ? " are forty niggers . And I know niggers , I do . " III " You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the heap of dried grasses where Mobamba lay asleep . Carstensen 's eye followed his as he gathered up the cards . " My old woman 's done a good haul for us today . " " You mean getting Niamkala here ? " " I do , Mate . " " But supposing we do get rid of Shackleton " ? Schnitter 's hand caressed his chin ? " that do n't tell us where the treasure is . " " Right you are . It do n't . But that high and mighty ' ' III young man , he can tell us . " UI " Supposing he wo n't ? " " Then , " said Carstensen , and he dealt the cards with an air of finality , " there are ways of makin ' him tell . " Schnitter did not reply . Instead , he threw up his head sharply . There were footsteps coming down the flume. ' jlll ' Carstensen jerked the torch from its socket . He held it high in his left hand . The right gripped his heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a table , waited , his hand on his automatic . Cf Out of the blackness of the flume a figure emerged . The torch light lighted the tormented face of Igor . lid  | Chapter Twenty THE RECKONING SHACKLETON reached the cave about half an hour after Igor had gone . He had seen the storm coming and hurried his return . " It 's about time for the rainy season to begin , " he said to Joan . " We ca n't count on staying on here in the Valley many days more . " Joan told him then of Igor 's coming and his question about Marakoff . Ned turned to her sharply . " You did n't tell him ? " " Yes , I did . " He stared at her uncomprehendingly . " What made you do that ? " he said at last . His brows drew together in a frown . " I thought you said you would n't . " " But he asked me point blank . " ( Why should it be so hard to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he knew he could trust me to give him the truth . There was nothing else I could do . " " You could have refused to answer him at all . You could have told him that only I could answer that question . " " But why should I do that ? " she said , quickly . " After all , why should n't Igor know that Marakoff is dead ? He has a right to know it . We . . . you . . . have no right to keep the truth from him . "  | " That 's not the point , " Shackleton broke in , and Joan was struck by the tiredness that was in his face and voice . " You should have put him off . I 'd told you how important it was . " Her head lifted proudly . " I wo n't lie . " il+l " I did n't ask you to lie . " He began pacing up and down the cave . His steps sounded sharp and quick and disturbed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I asked , because it was best . And you failed me . " And when she said nothing , " There 's no knowing what harm you may have done , " he said . " There are things you do n't know  --  things I 've II had to keep from you . " " That 's just it . " Her voice , steady till now , trembled a I1 little . " You keep so many things from me . " I le turned his eyes on her . " What do you mean ? " 11 " I mean , " she said , steadily , " that there are changes 11 in you . Just since we 've come here into the Valley . Things li'l ' I do n't understand . Oh , Ned " ? she pressed her hands together urgently ? " something . . . some one is coming i , ! j between us . " Ile came in one or two quick strides and stood before her , looking down into her face . " Joan , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not at once reply , " Who do you think is coming between us ? " The eyes she lifted to meet his were bright with unshed tears . " Marakoff is coming between us , " she said . The bitterness of her tone surprised him . " I feel as though I had known it for a long time and had only just had the courage to put it into words . " " Marakoff ! " He laughed harshly . " That 's like a woman , to be jealous of a man 's work . Marakoff said as much , I remember . He used to say that women are per-  | sistent and acquisitive and dominant . It 's not the man who matters to a woman . It 's her power over him . But I thought you were different . " " It 's not your work , " she defended herself . " I 'm not jealous of that or of Marakoff 's share in it . I 'm not jealous at all . Perhaps it 's truer to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Afraid of what I can see is happening to you  --  the real you . Afraid of seeing you grow calculating and cruel ; afraid of seeing you do things that a little while ago you would have scorned as contemptible and underhand . Oh , I know " ? her voice ran ahead of him , forestalling the objection she expected from him ? " I know  --  it 's all in the name of science . Science ! Marakoff believed in science , too . He believed that it justified all the evil , ugly things he did , and he 's making you believe it . You " ? her voice broke suddenly , she had said more than she intended ? " the man I love . " She turned her face from him to hide the trembling of her lips . He reached out a hand . He touched her with awkward tenderness . " Joan , dear , you 're being childish . " " Childish ! " She moved impatiently away . He sighed . He was thinking that this remote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan . She was getting jumpy and overwrought . Hysterical , too . He had only himself to blame . He should not have allowed her to come with him . Expeditions like this were no place for a woman . Certainly not for a woman like Joan ? gently nurtured , sheltered all her days . Another woman , perhaps one who was more primitive , more direct in her responses to life . .. .  | He went into the cave 's inner room and began to change his light attire for heavier garments . Joan followed . " You 're not going out ? " she asked , in alarm . " Yes , I am . I must . I 've got to find and talk with Igor . " She said no more , only watched him dully as he summoned Kolak . Bimbi was in his usual place on guard in the cave 's outer room . " Follow close after me , Kolak . " She saw the two disappear into the blackness of the night . Alone , Joan reviewed her scene with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fairly . His words had cut her deeply . Childish ! Was she that ? She was by nature and by right of the years of living at Cranbrook , among persons she trusted completely and who trusted her , singularly just even in her appraisals of herself . She was , too , impatient of subterfuge and devious dealings in others . Her own statement of herself had always been that she " rode straight . " She took her fences flying . Was that to be childish ? Or jealous ? Was she as Ned had said , quoting Marakoff , acquisitive and dominant in her love ? She knew instantly that she was not . But in the last days a new element had been wakened in her by her love ? a feeling that was deeply protective . It was as though all her awareness called her to defend the man she loved . Defend him against what ? A few hours ago she could not have said . But she knew now that it was to defend him against the influence of Marakoff . Igor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concerns and wishes , his quick recourse to Marakoff 's  | cynical words  --  these had thrown a startling light on what had been before but dim apprehensions . What did she actually know of Marakoff ? A man who would condemn his own daughter to what amounted to life imprisonment in this lonely and terrible Valley  --  an imprisonment of soul as well as of body  --  a man who could plan and carry through the " experiment " with Igor . . . . Such a man was evil . He was a man who could bend and mould people to his will . Was that what he was doing with Ned ? Was Marakoff 's sinister influence enveloping Ned , winning him to his way of thought and action ? It seemed to her that it was . She stopped herself sharply . Marakoff is dead , she reminded herself . But his influence had not died with him . There were his notes  --  the sealed packet he had given to Ned as a guide . Ned had been singularly reticent about them . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honour with her to do so . But now She took her resolve quickly . She had a duplicate key to the locked strong box . Ned had given it to her as a matter of precaution . Now she got it , and with trembling hands turned the lock and opened the box . The bulky packet of notes in Marakoff 's handwriting lay on top . She lifted them , held them a moment , looked at them in loathing . Then she went swiftly to the entrance of the cave where the fire burned and where Bimbi lay , alert and watchful , beside it .  | Bimbi roused himself on one elbow . Joan felt his grave eyes fixed on her . " Little Spear , the night is very dark , " Bimbi said . " England is very far away . I would be happier here " ? he laid his crossed hands on his breast ? " if Little Spear were there where the jungle is not . " " Oh , Bimbi , so would I ! " The words seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the notes in her hand . As she prepared to put them on the blaze she saw again , as she had seen that night on the Ledge , the envelope with the superscription : NOT TO BE OPENED UNTIL YOU HAVE LEFT THE VALLEY When they left the Valley ! She caught eagerly at the hope the words held out . Somehow she could not bring herself to destroy that with the rest . She would keep it . Surely it might be considered a good omen . But the rest  --  the notes She laid the thick packet directly on the fire . At once the flames began to writhe around it as though they welcomed it . " We 'll be going home soon , Bimbi , " Joan said , turning to him . Her voice shook a little , but with joy . " Soon we can forget . "  | Chapter Twenty-One GORILLA MOON THE look in Ned 's eyes when she told him , so it seemed to Joan , would haunt her always . There had been no opportunity for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white stern-lipped face , that no explanation she could give beyond her first , direct statement that she had destroyed the notes because she believed their influence was evil , and that Marakoff had intended them to be so , would he understand . He had been , she realized , terribly angry . And for a moment she had been frightened . Not at what she had done  --  she still clung to her belief in the rightness of that ? but at its effect on him . She had seen the hot colour flame into his face , while his eyes burned . Then she had seen him clench his hands and shut his lips hard , driving the flood of his anger back within the gates of control . The power Marakoff had over him had never seemed to her so complete . It shut her out like a wall . After that one brief scene , when Shackleton , soaking wet , and battered by the storm , had come back to the cave , after a fruitless search for Igor , and she had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk between them , only a strained and heartbreaking silence . But miserable as she was , and filled with dark forebodings as to the future , there was , too , a certain exhilaration in the knowledge that she had thrown down the gage and declared herself .  | From now on it was to be she against Marakoff . Morning came , and the Valley was bright and glistening after the rain . She watched Ned making his preparations to go again in search of Igor . His face , in the morning light , looked drawn and tired  --  the face of a man who has not slept and for whom the dark is too full of disturbing things . " I will leave Kolak here with you , " he said , stiffly . " Where is Bimbi ? " " Bimbi will be here , too , of course . But not all day . There is something I want him to do for me . " She did not inquire what that was . She only asked , " Will you be gone all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen how wistful was the look in her eyes . But his back was turned to her . His head was bent as he adjusted the straps of his camera about his neck . " I wo n't be back before dark , " he replied . " As I told you , we ca n't count on staying on here many more days . I must get in as much as I can . " " But I thought your data on the Yellow Ape was complete , " she said , wondering a little . Surely he had told her that when he had exulted over the photographs she had developed and printed . " On the Ape , yes . " The terseness of his words seemed to forbid her asking anything further of his plans . Joan , however , was not disposed at any time to turn back before a five-barred gate . " Then you are planning on going into the Inner Valley again ? " She made an effort to make her tone so light that the words appeared the idlest of comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eager enthusiasm  | that had fired his words had shown her how deeply he desired to push his explorations further . " If I can . " That meant , Joan interpreted , quickly , " If Marnia will take me . " Marnia  --  Marakoff 's daughter  --  who held the key to the secret valley where the Lost People had lived , Marnia and the Yellow Ape  --  these were Marakoff 's allies . Then she must reckon with them , too . " Flower-of-the-Gourd droops . " In the silence that followed on Ned 's departure , Toolumbo appeared suddenly out of the greenery , as his way was . " Flower-of-the-Gourd ! " He plucked at her sleeve . " Mufumbi ( Be off ) ! " Joan said , impatient of his mischievous foolery . But immediately the hurt surprise in Toolumbo 's eyes touched her . Was she not overturning his little world as Ned 's curtness had rocked and blasted hers ? She called him back . He came gleefully , his eyes and teeth ashine . He hopped on one foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is Cleopatra ? " Joan asked . Toolumbo cocked his head and regarded her as one who guards a secret . " I have left her by the spring . I have tied her by the front leg so she can not run away . " " Poor Cleopatra ! Why did you do that ? " " She will drink the water , " Toolumbo vouchsafed to explain , " and the shadow of the fig tree will fall on her ? the sacred fig tree . She will bring forth . There will be many Cleopatras. "  | He nodded at Joan sagely , and with intense satisfaction in the workings of magic . She could not help smiling . " And what will you do with many Cleopatras ? " " One I will give to you , " Toolumbo said , " and one I will give to Son-of-a-Chief . " He raised his voice and looked inquiringly at Bimbi , to see what effect this announcement would have on him . But Bimbi , plaiting a long rope of liana fibres , was elaborately not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tony ! The remembrance of his fresh , round face and little , pleased smile came before Joan as something unaccountably strange . Tony Derek Aunt Leila Cranbrook these were like things in a dream she had dreamed long ago . Only this too bright world of the jungle , only this valley over which brooded the sinister spirit of Marakoff , were real . She started out of her reverie . One of the natives had come silently up the path from the encampment . He was standing staring at her fixedly . It was Niamkala . She recognized the blue tatooings across his chest . She noted , too , with surprise , he had added to these several splashes of bright yellow clay . " Do you want something ? " she asked . It was Shackleton 's strict rule that none of the blacks save Bimbi and Kolak , who had succeeded to Tongo 's place , and the inconsequent Toolumbo , should approach the cave . Niamkala did not reply . She was sure he had understood , for he had lived long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English .  | His silence and the steady expressionlessness of his gaze disturbed her . " Bimbi ! " she called . There was no response . She called again , more loudly . Kolak appeared round the corner of the rock , with Toolumbo at his heels . " Where is Bimbi ? " Kolak spread his hands in a gesture that told he did not know . He caught sight of Niamkala , and moved a little along the path to where he was standing . Joan heard the two voices  --  question and reply . Then Niamkala turned and disappeared down the path , as he had come . Kolak returned . " What did Niamkala want ? " Kolak shook his head . His face looked troubled . Joan asked again : " Where did Bimbi go ? Has he been gone long ? " " I do not know , " Kolak replied . " He is gone , that is all . He went quietly , as the panther goes . " She remembered then that Ned had said that he had a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what had occasioned his absence . " Now I go , too , " Toolumbo broke in . He looked to see if she were giving this announcement proper attention . " I go to the spring to see if that has happened . " He stepped hopefully away . Ned 's return toward sunset brought Joan a sense of relief . She had resolutely set her face away from the vague alarm Niamkala 's behaviour had inspired . She was determined not to reveal her gathering timidity to Ned , lest he call her childish again . But she could not keep from commenting to him on the unusual stillness that brooded over the natives ' camp .  | " It 's nothing . They are preparing for the feast , " Ned said . Joan asked what feast . " To celebrate the full of the moon tonight . I gave them permission . It 's a ceremony for these Bantus . " She told him about Bimbi . " He has not come back , " she said . " Ah ! " From the way his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance for him . " Ned , " she gathered her pride and courage to ask , " is anything wrong , really ? Is there anything I ought to know ? " " No . " Ile passed his hand across his face , as though he would wipe away the weariness and the anxiety that lined it . " Nothing , Joan . Do n't bother . " Again she felt his hand shutting a door against her . Meanwhile , the darkness that brimmed the Valley was filled with a sense of expectancy  --  a hush , an awe . The world , like the blacks , was waiting . Then it came  --  the great golden ball they had awaited . It seemed to bloom over the Valley 's eastern rim like one of the quick-unfolding jungle flowers . The brooding silence was broken by a shout . " They 're beginning , " Shackleton said . Some one had heaped fresh fuel on the natives ' fire . It leaped wildly to meet the moon . The shouting increased in volume . Mingled with it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited , falsetto shriek of the little one-stringed violins . That savage frenzy , and the vibrant , pulsing quality of the moonlight striking against her own shut-in silence , seemed to Joan suddenly more than she could bear .  | She got up restlessly and went into the cave . As she did so she saw Shackleton drop his head suddenly into his hands . Now the drums were beginning . Their rattle became a deep , relentless undercurrent to the shriek of the balaphones and pipes . " I suppose I should go down and have an eye to things , " Shackleton was thinking . But he still sat on , smoking cigarette after cigarette , still captive to an almost savage anger against Joan . In the throb of the native music the dark lips of Africa were speaking to him . They were saying : " Here is savagery too . Here in that primitive world , half beast 's , half man 's , from which you have sprung . Here are things older than the gods of the western world . Older and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awareness , but never so strongly as now , when , weary in body and mind , he was forced to contemplate the possible failure of much of his work . Marakoff 's notes lost forever ! And that Joan should have done that ! Joan ! It was disturbing , too , that he had had no sign of Igor anywhere that day . The cave , when he had gone to it , was empty . Marnia , whom he had come on near the entrance to the Inner Valley , was in one of her inconsequent , wilful moods . She had refused haughtily to take him into the Valley . He had accomplished nothing . He stood up , and the moonlight lapped him round like smooth waters . He seemed to feel its touch on his body . It stirred him strangely . Just then the greenery that swept up the slope to the ledge parted ; a black hand reached out of it , caught the  | edge of the rock , and tightened to draw a man upward . Bimbi stood beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I have seen . " " What have you seen ? " " As you bade me , that day after you returned from the secret Valley , I have searched for the place where the white man who was false to you has his camp . Today I have found it  --  in the Black Caves . " In a few words Bimbi told what he had found in his spying . Ile had made his way to the Ledge above the cliff . He had crept part way down the flume . He had heard voices . " Schnitter 's I knew . The other , too , I knew long ago , in London  --  Carstensen . And the black woman who is with them  --  Mobamba . I know now it was one of those who killed Tongo . Master , they mean harm . " " W hat did you hear ? " Shackleton asked , quickly . " They spoke your name . They laughed . Then they spoke of that which is hidden in the secret Valley . " Bimbi paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What then ? " " Carstensen said , ' One must be killed . ' Then Mobamba came away , up the passage in the rock . She entered this Valley . " " Where did she go ? " Shackleton rapped out . " I followed . She passed by the camp . By the shade of the sacred fig tree one was waiting . " " Who was it ? " " Master , it was Niamkala . " Niamkala ! The fanatic dreamer who was obsessed by the dread of Marakoff . Niamkala joining forces with Mobamba . Niamkala working with Carstensen and Schnitter . " They went together a little way , " Bimbi continued .  | " Then they parted . Mobamba went on . I do not know  --  I think into the secret Valley . " Mobamba going into the Valley of Creeping Men ? Shackleton dismissed this . Not likely . Still The noise in the camp below had risen higher . In the firelight black forms were dancing . Bodies crouched , sprang , leaped wildly in time to that urgent rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to go down there , Bimbi . I do n't like that about Niamkala . If there is trouble brewing " But Bimbi 's gesture held him . Bimbi 's voice said : " Look ! " The ring of dancers about the fire broke , fell apart . It was not a ring now , but a procession . Hands reached for sticks , and these , thrust into the fire , became torches . Held aloft , their flaming smoky light struck wickedly on upheld spears and assegais . The procession was moving . They were leaving the space about the fire . The lights twinkled in and out of the grove beyond the encampment , moving farther up the Valley . " They go , " Bimbi said . " There is danger in that . " But to Shackleton their going brought a quick sense of relief . Let them go . Savage to savage . Let them work off their moon-madness . They would return , spent and not a little abashed ; they would come creeping back to the security of the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was glad . Glad just now to be relieved of that proximity to the world of primitive man . It was as though he feared those savage things within himself of which the drums had spoken to him . " One has come back . " Bimbi stepped to the edge of the rock , his body bent taut like an archer 's bow .  | Then something came hurtling through the air . Something landed at their feet . Shackleton sprang to it . But Bimbi was before him . Bimbi held it up in the moonlight  --  the hand of a black gorilla . Blood from the severed veins dripped down Bimbi 's wrist . " The beast has been killed but a little time ago , " he said . He put the hand down . " Master , do not close your eyes to this warning . It means ? Go ! ' " Shackleton thought quickly . There had been that shrivelled gorilla hand laid on Joan 's breast , and now this . What was the message meant for him to read ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Bimbi came close to him . He spoke with gathering in-tensity , " It is the night of the Gorilla Moon . It is for that they wanted the feast . They have forgotten Father Hilary ? forgotten the pale-faced God . Tonight they know only the Chattering Gods . These men  --  Carstensen and Schnitterknow this . " Shackleton kicked the ape 's hand into the shadow . He strode to the cave 's entrance . " Joan ! " She came at once . " Get ready , " he said curtly . " We 're going . " " Now ? " " Yes . At once . " He told her briefly what had happened . " It amounts to mutiny . " At that moment something bounded into their midst ? Toolumbo . His thin shoulders went up sharply , in surprise .  | " What is in the pot ? " he said , gaily . " Is it joy or is it sorrow ? " Shackleton 's voice commanded : " Take Toolumbo , Bimbi . Come , Joan ! Quick ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly , silently through the night . When they came to the Ledge at the far end of the Valley , Shackleton said to Joan : " You and Bimbi and the boy must stay here . You 'll be safe until I get back . " " Where are you going ? " she cried . " I 'm going back for Marnia . " Marnia ! She would have stopped him , but he had already turned and was gone from her . She put both her hands over her face . Then she raised her head and looked out , wondering . Would he bring Igor , too ?  | Chapter Twenty-Two PRISONERS OF LOVE IGOR walked back and forth under the broad boughs of the mimosa that leaned and drooped its sensitive blooms , with a kind of fragrance of delicacy and beauty , near the entrance to Marakoff 's cave . He liked being in the shelter of its boughs . To him the tree had long been a symbol of the exquisite , unmatched beauty of Marnia . In his hand he held the opal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a symbol that could be held in the hand , of Marakoff 's treasure . The mere touch of it now gave him a sense of security . Moreover , he had a fixed superstition about the opal . When Marakoff had left it with him he had said to Igor , smiling darkly : " Look in it from time to time as into the face of some one whom you would trust and consult . It has known many things that like itself are dark and bright , good and evil , fire and moonlight . Let it speak to you when you are alone . " He had looked at it from time to time and had interpreted what he had taken to be its meaning . At times the fire in it seemed low and sleeping ; at others , and these were the times when his own spirit was exalted , the fire in it seemed to him free-moving , liquid almost , flowing . He had held it in his hand and looked into it a little while ago , and the molten fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was melted and fluid . Immediately he leaped to the  | conclusion that all would now be well between Marnia and himself . He slipped it back in the wallet which he sometimes wore , with a lingering touch . His mind dwelt on the happenings of the past few days . He felt as a man might feel who has turned over a whole page of his life , close written with perplexity , blotted with tears and torment and hate ; like one who has turned a page over , out of sight , and laid a hand upon it . What lay before him now was a page once more of his and Marnia 's life . Shackleton , who had brought so much disturbance and torment into his days , was gone now ; had perhaps by this time left the Valley , and left it for ever . The relief of this was unexpectedly great . Much as he had suffered from Shackleton 's presence , he did not know until now , when he was relieved of that presence , how deep his suffering had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hideous , haunted darkness into sunlight , from miserable torment into sudden peace . No more , now , of those haunting moments of wondering about Marnia and Shackleton ; no more watching for a light in her eyes that would spell ruin to Marakoff 's experiment ; no more of those fiendish doubts of her , like the fangs of a beast ; nor of those terrible , corroding jealousies that had eaten slowly , remorselessly into his soul . He looked up into the delicate loveliness of the mimosa tree and his lips drew back in a smile . There should be birds singing . He reached out and for sheer joy shook one of the branches as though its quietness troubled him . Immediately the delicate pink fingers of the flowers shrank and closed in , like things afraid of him . At once he was sorry . He stooped and put his lips to  | them . He had been hurt . He knew what that was . He must not hurt anything . Only kindness , now . Gone ! God , how good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ; perhaps her anger . It would probably take some time for her to adjust herself to the conditions . But , oh , he could be tolerant now , tolerant as the gods are who have all power , all disposition , in their hands . He would be gentle with her , enduring with her , tenderly silent with her . Now that life had given her back to him , he could be patient . His patience would be up before the dawn . It would not set with the stars . Like the patience of God , it would endure . He shook the hair out of his eyes and gazed raptly again into the blossoming boughs . " Marnia ! Marnia ! " his thought ran . " I will be God to you ! Marnia , my beloved ! I will bless you ! I will care for you with loving kindness . Do what you will , I will not hold it against you . Torment me as you please , I will forgive it . No , I will not even need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where love is . I will love you and enfold you in quiet and in safety . Marnia , my own ! " " 0 my God " ? his lips moved ? " depart not from me ! " An old religious ecstasy , such as he had neither felt nor thought of for years , swept over him . He closed his eyes . There swam back into his thought an Easter eve long ago ? a Springtime in Russia . The ground was moist . There was snow still in the hollows . All day there had been across the tender grass the faint blue shadows of the spring . The night air was cool and quivering with the throbbing happiness of bells . The Easter-eve bonfires were lighted . The firelight danced with delight on joyous faces . People saluted one another with joy .  | " Christ is risen ! " The great church doors stood open . Streams of joyous people came and went . Some were buying Easter cakes ; others were waiting to have them blessed . All about , like a fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! that was at Stavinsk , years ago . He remembered the archimandrite , a great tall man with stooped shoulders , and wearing a gold mitre . Igor himself pushed into the church . What a freeing of the soul ! the altar gates were flung wide . The voices of the choir rose , vibrating . In front of the altar gates the censer was swung widely , fragrantly , this side and that . The altar lights shone through the faint , floating blue veils that it spread . The choir was intoning the canticle to Jesus the Most Sweet . How long ago ! The incense cleansed and purified his heart . He was reborn  --  reborn to joy . Tender spring buds were on the trees . Through the blue smoke the words came , hundredvoiced , hundred-toned , hundred-stranded . " Lift up thine eyes , 0 Sion . " His soul now bowed down as it had bowed in his boyhood at the canticles of Easter joy and deliverance . " Oh , lovely ! Oh , sweet is thy mercy , Whose tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister to Thee , Fair fruit of joy . Tree of graciousness , Fruit sweet to the taste , for which the soul languisheth ? " Life had tormented him and frozen him with fear as winter torments and freezes the earth . But , oh , to free him at last , that his days might bud and be covered with dew  | in the dawn ; that his days might be Easter . He and Marnia forever now as Marakoff had left them .. . alone in the Valley ! Marakoff 's daughter ! He emerged at last from his ecstasy like a man waking from a dream . The cool Easter eve and the memory and delight and joy of it were flung away like flowers on a dark current . They were gone with his boyhood . All that was past . It would not return . Around him , instead , was the warmth of equatorial Africa to which the tenderness of Spring never came , and , overhead , the drooping , withdrawing , untouchable mimosa of the tropics . Far ! Far ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much to say to her which must be said . The thought of Marakoff returned to him like a presence . Ile put his head into his hands and remained plunged in deep realizations . Down into them deeply he plunged , deeper and deeper , until his feet struck the very bottom . lie had been loyal to Marakoff . For years he had lived in the thought of Marakoff 's return . Marakoff would return and know that Igor had not failed in his fidelity . He would have only to look in Marnia 's eyes and Igor 's eyes to know . It would be Marakoff himself who would break the seal of that fidelity ; who would give him his reward . He would see white ecstasy as Galahad saw the Grail , blindingly beautiful , with angels round about it . The long , tormenting waiting would be at an end . The unappeased hunger would be over . Marnia would be his  --  utterly his . On that hope he had lived and sustained himself . His long torment had been a thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marakoff 's coming would be like the sweetness of Easter in Stavinsk . There would be joy and release . " Fair fruit of joy for which the soul languisheth ? "  | Marnia would be his . This was as it should have been . . . and would have been  --  but Marakoff was dead . If Marakoff were still alive ! Marakoff with his magnificent powers ! Why , Marakoff could have mended the world ! Marakoff could have made Marnia love him ! But Joan Shackleton 's story and Carstensen 's evidence as to the pomegranate could not be doubted . Marakoff was dead and Marnia had looked too often into the eyes of Shackleton . Marnia had slipped out of his own protective hands . She had been his for so long . She would never be his again . She would , perhaps , play with him , torment him , even in her heartless creature way she might give herself to him , but always her thought would be with Shackleton . Igor knew profoundly how completely he had lost all the joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intolerable acuteness of that thought there rose now in him a towering resolution . She should be his as she had always been , and in no other way , until death and Marakoff released him . His vow to Marakoff should be the rule of his and her life . Shackleton was gone . The guarding of Marakoff 's treasure was now once more completely in his hands , with only this difference . . . that the guarding now would be forever , without release . His mind worked rapidly , feverishly , on this plan . Where was she ? Why did she not come ? He wanted to tell her that Shackleton had gone . He was eaten up with eagerness to get all this clear to her , to make her understand that from now on she was his and his only , a prisoner to his vow . There was a slight sound . He looked up . She stood in front of him . Behind her , like a nimbus of her own whiteness and  | beauty , the moon shone . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , the epitome of an almost unearthly beauty  --  as though the beauty of the moon , cold and shining , and of an overpowering loveliness , had taken on human form . She seated herself beside him . The moonlight delicately sifting through the mimosa boughs fell over them both . He did not trust himself now to look at her . " You know how often I have said to you , ' When your father returns ? ' " " Yes . " " All that is at an end . " His words fell slowly and with finality : " He will not come again . " " Why ? " " I-le is dead . " She did not answer . She folded her hands and leaned forward and seemed to think deeply . " That does not alter anything , " she said gently at last , almost lightly . He bent , too , and looked ahead of him into the future of his own creating . " It changes the whole world , " he said , tensely . She turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , it does n't . It will not alter anything . He-WhoIs-Different has said we may go with him across the world . He told me about the Spring there . There are buds on the trees and there are soft shadows across the grass , and there is the hawthorn . It will not matter that my father is not there . . . there will be the Spring . " Igor 's hands closed tensely , " That can never be , " he said . " He-Who-Is-Different has gone . You will not see him again . We are here , only you and I , as we were before . " How still and surprised and waiting the moonlight was .  | How long and silently it waited . On the ledge below , Somba , who had followed her , turned and gave a soft moan , as was his wont on nights of so great and searching a brightness . Igor said , " You shall be mine as always you were . " As he spoke he had all he could do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurt her , to crush her and make her suffer in some physical way commensurate with his own torment . At the same moment , ahead of him , lines of shadows seemed to take on the form and likeness of Marakoff  --  Marakoff , tall , with brows bent , watching him . It was a passing thing , only an instant , and they were moon-wrought shadows again , but the effect on him was profound . " Your father gave you into my keeping . We shall be prisoners of love , you and I . . . for ever . . . since he who was here has gone . " She turned to him . There was almost brightness in her face . " Why do you talk to me about a man like that ? " she said . " Why should I remember him ? Let it be as it has been . " With a lovely , slow gesture she leaned and put an arm about his shoulders . Her touch went through him like fire and ice . With her other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently . He endured it as steel might endure the touch of the mimosa . She put her face near his and looked ahead into the shadows . In the madness of the moment it seemed to him she also must sense a tall dark figure standing there , which was yet not standing there . " Tell me , " she said , and her voice was like the voice of a child , utterly without emotion , only clear with the simple desire to know . " As a man may feel toward  | a woman . . . as He-Who-Is-Different feels when he wishes to take the Woman-who-Came in his arms  --  like Spring in the country he told me of  --  you never feel that ? " She stooped and laid her lips coolly against his shoulder . For a moment he had the mad determination to enfold her , to blot out everything  --  Marakoff , the tropic night , memory , loyalty , honour  --  to fuse them all in one moment of attained longing . " You will be loyal until death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sworn he heard the words . Once more the figure of Marakoff , clear to his imagination , formed itself out of the shadows before him . He freed himself from her , save that she still kept a hand on his hand . " Marnia " ? his voice rang in a kind of agony ? " we shall be as we have been , you and I. There are prison bars never to be broken . " " Very well , " she said ; " only I do not call them prison bars . We were happy . We will be happy again now he is gone . W hat shall we do tomorrow ? Shall we hunt ? " A moment of peace came to him . She was a child still . She would not add to his torment . " I shall knot you a new snare , " she continued . " Yes , we were happy . 1 ) o you remember the day you gave me the opal ? That was a happy day . Put it around my neck again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that day , that the Valley is mine . " She watched him take the opal from the little wallet . She bent the loveliness of her head toward him . " Put it about my neck as you did then . " He placed the chain about her neck with shaking fingers . She let the great stone lie upon her hand a moment and turned it to the moon . " How beautifully the fire moves in it . "  | He watched her tensely , his whole being bent toward her . " Am I beautiful ? " she said , with the simplicity and straightforwardness of a child . He did not answer . Could not . She got up and stood facing the moonlight and the shadows . " Tomorrow we will go on the hunt , " Igor said . To shut out the too great beauty of her he put his arm across his eyes and , with his head bent , entered his cave . When he was in the shelter of it he bent himself to the ground , slid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I have sinned , " he said , softly . " Her lips were laid upon me . Forgive me , for Christ 's sake . Oh , you who will never come , be with me ! Direct me still ! " He lay a long while , passing through dark passages of torment and self-blame and rededication . When he rose , time had passed , more than he would have supposed . He went dazedly to the opening in the front of the cave . Only the moonlight and the secret silence of the mimosa tree were there . He went to the ledge from which the path led down , and called : " Somba ! " No sound came back . He went to Marnia 's cave and spoke her name : " Marnia . " No answer came .  | WITCH-DOINGS THE full moon flooded the Valley . Its light hung in silver strands , woven with black shadows where the marawong trees twisted their serpentlike trunks , that seemed to writhe out of the shallow black ! I ' swamp like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to go on their bellies once more . But , instead , they held themselves poised , and it seemed listening and waiting . Waiting for what ! From tussock to tussock , and along a little ridge of dry land , to an opening slightly higher than the surrounding morass , and which was covered with green , Niamkala , with a fanatical light in his eyes , had led the men . Edging the grassy oval , doum palms rose , making a feathery relief for the eye from the sombreness of the marawong trees . Over these , as men climb for lookout and spying , climbed giant lianas . At one end lay several flat stones , and behind them something about the size of an altar , but completely hid by palm branches laid against it . In the centre of the oval a fire licked around branches of aromatic carite wood . Round this , seated , were the men , fully armed . Some of them here and there had the left hand stained a bright yellow . The eyes of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following some disturbing thought .  | Niamkala stood near the centre of the circle . IIe wore a head-dress made of parrot and egret feathers . His body was carefully oiled with the native cocoa grease . He was naked save for his loin-cloth , but the close and fanciful tattooing on his thighs and breast gave an impression of special distinction , a calling higher than the rest , as the ' broideries of a priest 's robe mark his rank above those he serves or directs . Both his hands were painted a bright yellow . He had on his arm a basket made of rushes , also dyed yellow . From it he took bits of the bitter zalota root and gave them to the men , one by one , muttering as he did so : " Eat . Drink . " The men stooped forward and bent their heads low . " There has been sin ! " chanted Niamkala . " There has been sin ! But the Great One will not hide his face forever . Give him your hearts ! " The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriating words from the Church service , in which Father Hilary had long trained him , moaned . " Hear us , good Lord ! Hear us , we beseech Thee ! " Suddenly , on a little wind , came from the direction of the Inner Valley , what was at first only a faint murmur . As the wind rose and fell the sound swelled terribly into a mad chattering . " Chattering Gods ! " shrieked Niamkala , bounding , and going wild with frenzy of homage and recognition . At the other end of the oval , near the banked-up palms , a great , dark mass stirred itself , rose partly from the earth , then took on form  --  the form of the voodoo woman . She rose first to her knees , then , with a spreading of her great webbed hands , bent back and forth , moaning , as though some intolerable misery in her called them to repentance.  | The others , noting her , swayed and moaned . " Be unto us a strong tower ! " moaned Kolak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shackleton made his way , with sure step , along the path leading to that side of the Valley where Marnia 's cave was . He anticipated trouble in persuading Igor to come with him , but he counted on the now very definite danger that lay in the native menace . Marnia , he knew , or believed , would follow him without a word , glad to go with him , though scornful of danger . In the direction of the swamp , a lurid glow showed where the men were gathered together . In the swamp ! Of course they would be there ! Fortunately , he need not go near that section of the Valley . The Valley had never seemed so much his own . In these two weeks since he and Joan had entered it he had , owing to Marakoff , inherited an entire world  --  a new world such as he could never have imagined , and all of it here within those small bounds . How small a space to contain so much  --  Marnia , Igor , the Yellow Guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ape temple , the treasure-chambers of Marakofi , yes , and now the return to savagery of some forty men who had thrown off Father Hilary 's gentler teaching , as though it had been only a cloak , and had returned to the stark-naked savage beliefs of their original tribe . The enchantment of the place , with the still cascades of its giant drooping ferns , played upon him . How sweet everything was , yet how open , as secret and as open , as unfathomable and as frank , as Marnia ! Marnia ! He quickened his step . Soon now he would give her and Igor his word of command .  | A slight sound stopped his foot . Another straightened his shoulders and leaped alarmedly to his ears . His hand tightened on his revolver . Then it relaxed . It was Marnia ? it must be Marnia . As the same instant , while he waited for the light sound in front of him to take on her form , there was a sudden crash through the ferns back of him . He swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like grappling-irons , dragging his arms backward . He fired . The next instant , his revolver was knocked from his hand . Impossible to get at the small pistol which he carried in an inner pocket . At the same moment some one else sprang from behind the fern . Other hands ! There was the glint of silver in moonlight . He fought furiously . " Steady , there ! " " Pleased to meet you , Mr. Shackleton . " It was Schnitter 's sneering voice close to his ear , while Schnitter helped the other to hold and bind his wrists . " We 've met before . And this here is my friend Mr. Carstensen . " " I ai n't never sailed this course before , " said Carstensen , pulling the knots tighter , " but I 'm shore glad to see you . The skipper here , my friend Schnitter , was n't sure you 'd come . But I says , says I : Yare ! Yare ! He 'll be back all right  --  after the girl . ' Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you 've got to tack to the breeze as it comes . " Schnitter placed the barrel of his pistol between Shackleton 's shoulders . " Face about , " he said . " Take the path in the other direction , and keep going . " " Toward the swamp ? " Shackleton said , coolly . They started .  | Schnitter took an extra step to bring himself nearer Shackleton . " How does this suit you , Mr. Shackleton ? " The shouts of the natives could be heard now . " Stop when you get in sight of ' em , " ordered Schnitter . They came at last past the twisted marawong trees , to the edge of the open space at the centre of the swamp . The blacks are dancing and shouting , a medley and madness of excitement . They do not even notice the three men . Carstensen and Schnitter make quick work of binding Shackleton to one of the trees . " Now , go and get the old witch , " says Schnitter , gruffly , yet uneasily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not go near Mobamba . She is lumbering about the oval in a lost , rolling way . Even in their frenzy the natives are terribly aware of her , and reverently give her a wide berth . Her eyes are closed . I er great hands are spread out before her , feeling the air , webbedly , for presences ; searching space horribly for the body of a spirit that will lead her . Instead , Carstensen waits until Niamkala , in the fury of the dance , comes near him . Then he steps almost bravely in front of him , waves his arms in his face , like flapping sails , and shouts : " Where 's Marakoff 's pomegranate ? " Even in the midst of the fearful din , Niamkala hears , stops , and looks dazedly , then remembers . This was the agreement . Niamkala was to take the men to the swamp , there where the idol was ; there where Mobamba had made the terrible sacrifice . There where their purification and atonement would be accomplished . There Carstensen would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pomegranate .  | Yes , and Carstensen had come . Only , the pomegranate this time was big and black , a rolling hulk , a huge fruit full of the terrible seeds of power and magic . " You 're to keep ' em busy , d'ye see ? " says Carstensen , in a business-like tone . " Marakoff says Mobamba 's to go with us . She 's going to prepare the way for all of you . You all stay here until she comes back . We 've fetched something to please Marakoff . " He throws a gesture with his thumb over his shoulder toward Shackleton . Niamkala looks and cringes , and puts his hands over his eyes . It is fearful to see leaders led ; evil times are afoot when the mighty are laid low ! It is not good to see the gods bound . " That 's all right , " says Carstensen , reading his thought and applying a quick remedy . " Marakoff said , ' This man 's a sneak ! ' Cause he went into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Marakoff and the Yellow Brotherhood . Marakoff said : You take him , and bind him , and take him to Niamkala , and you tell Niamkala to watch him good . ' D'ye see ? " On this breaks in the bark of Schnitter 's voice . There is a note of anxiety even in its bluster : " Damn you ! Come along ! " Carstensen silences him with a gesture . He does not look at Schnitter . Instead , he points a finger direct at Niamkala and says : " Now , you go fetch the pomegranate . D'ye see ? " Niamkala goes with a wavering , almost drunken step toward the great outspread hands of Mobamba , as they feel and search and explore emptiness . They touch him . She stops as at a signal , and moans . He reaches up and takes one of her wrists , reverently , and directs her step around the edge of the oval . She still  | keeps her eyes closed , but she croons now in a high , windlike wail , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carstensen . Carstensen jerks her forward with a rough gesture . " Here , you ! Marakoff says  --  Marakoff says : The Valley ! ' Marakoff says : Go there as quick as you can ' ! " She sways a moment , opens her eyes , takes direction , and then stumbles forward . Carstensen and Schnitter , without glancing in Shackleton 's direction , follow on her heels as though her great black body were a solid magnet , and they iron . Out of the swamp , into the open places  --  such heavenly beautiful places now , too , in the moonlight  --  the three dark forms pass . Across the sandy opening where the moonlight lies in a pool of surprised light around the spring . Without pause , they disappeared crashingly in the direction of the Inner Valley . Time went on , yet seemed to stand still , perfectly still , in that open silver space . It was some time later that into the restored stillness and whiteness lying about the spring stepped a little , slight body , slim and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beautiful . The forefinger of a child 's black hand is held up . " Cleopatra ! Little queen ! Are you there ? " Pause and search . Nothing ! " Miserable little one ! Are you waiting ? " Only moonlight . Nothing else . Toolumbo looked and looked . Nothing . Impossible . Toolumbo was a very skinful of incredulity . " Wretched little creature ! Contemptible little cook-pot of my grandmother ! Cleopatra ! "  | From the shadow of a fern that dripped light a bright green eye looked up and winked . " Oh ! " He stooped and snatched , and held to him a tiny wriggling jewelled creature , and bent his head to it . An infinitesimal tongue gave a lick to his cheek . Toolumbo executes a caper . Now back to Flower-of-the-Gourd ! All women are alike . If he had returned without Cleopatra , Flower-ofthe-Gourd would have found it out and would have scolded him for a bootless and dangerous errand . But now she will be sure to praise him . And what is so sweet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tricky . Never , never will he give Cleopatra the chance again to escape . He will tie her by the hind leg the next time . Shackleton , tormented by his helplessness , watched the natives . Niamkala was haranguing them . He was bidding them repent for having deserted their gods , the gorillas , to follow , instead , after Father Hilary 's God . The Valley would have been theirs but for that . Now sacrifice had been made . Blood had been spilt . They must bow themselves down and repent . " Have mercy on us ! " moaned Kolak . Shackleton writhed , trying to loosen the cords that bound him . It was of no use . Vivid pictures flashed across his mind : Joan desperately waiting for him ; Marnia facing , at last , perhaps the maniacal fury of the blacks . He looked about frantically . He recalled the white moonlight as he came  --  white like her forehead , and the shadows , as  | dark as her hair . He was to have said to her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have come . And now ! There was Bimbi , of course , and Bimbi would care for Joan 's safety . But how lost everything else was ! " There is one here , " Niamkala 's voice rose , " who dared enter the Valley . The Great One has delivered him to us ! He is there ! " They would have rushed at him , but Niamkala flung his arms in the air and stopped them . " When you have prayed before the one-who-has-been  - -  sacrificed . " He turned and led them toward the end of the oval . " Bow down ! " shouted Niamkala . " The sacrifice has been made ! " He rushed to the end of the oval , where the flat stones lay and the screen of palm boughs rose . " Mobamba has spilled blood . Behold the sacrifice ! " Ile climbed up and tore at the palms with frantic fingers . They fell away with a chattering sound . What they had hidden stood revealed . The form of a huge , dead black ape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head rested forward on the breast and was grizzled . The eyes half-lidded , were glared , and stared . In the breast was a great gaping wound , made evidently by an assegai . At the sight of the black and grizzled god the men went into roaring madness and flung themselves on their faces in front of it , and writhed . Niamkala waved his arms . " We are sorry ! " he shouted . " We repent ! We will kill those who have violated the Valley ! There is one here  | whom we will pull apart , whose blood our fathers shall drink ! " " Accept our offering , 0 Lord ! " Kolak raised his head from the ground to utter this . They all grovelled and moaned . The great , dead black beast made no move , but Niamkala thought he saw it nod . " It is the sign ! " he shrieked . " The Great One has forgiven . He has nodded . He says you are forgiven ! Now , go and kill ! Tear apart ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , shrieking , get to their knees , then to their feet . With spears and shields clattering , and with Niamkala at their head , they plunge in the direction of the marawong trees where Shackleton stands bound . What is this they come against , as against a spear , sharp and terrible ? No spear  --  that can be struck down and broken  --  but a cry of rage , such as none of them have heard before ; a woman 's cry , followed almost instantly by the terrible , snarling , forbidding menacing cry of a beast : " Ou-000 ? mmm ! " The natives bend , and lean , and fall together , one against another . Some of them raise their shields protectingly above their heads . Those who dare look up see a spirit m'buiti  --  a beauty , a loveliness , a rage , a fury ; and beside her the Yellow Ape  --  the chosen of the gods ! Is this the end ? Somba stands facing them  --  a terrible figure . His great eyes , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niamkala is on his face now , moaning . Marnia 's eyes move over them , too , flaming , as though she would wither them as fire withers dry leaves that huddle . " 1Vlarnia ! " Shackleton 's voice recalls her .  | " Quick ! Take this knife from my belt . " She does so . It takes only a moment to cut the cords that bind him . Shackleton steps up to the men . They feel rather than see the severity of his old command . " You have offended the Yellow One ! " he says , savagely . " You have angered the Great One who sent me ? Marakoff ! " They bend lower under the whip of that name . " Marakoff who sent me to this Valley bids me tell you that he is terribly angry that you have destroyed one of the Chattering Ones . If you would not have Marakoff and the gods destroy every man of you , you must lie here , in front of the still one , fasting , for three days and nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of it the moan of Kolak swings like a censer . " I lave mercy ! " " Go ! " thunders Shackleton , pointing to the great gorilla . " Marakoff commands it . " They turn and fling themselves in that direction , and fall on their knees before the ghastly , heavy-lidded figure . Shackleton swings around to Marnia . She is watching him with a kind of joy in her eyes . " Come with me ! " he says sharply . He motions her to take the path . She does so , at the same time summoning Somba . Shackleton steps close behind her , and Somba , his head low , without a sound , but with a rolling eye , follows them .  | Chapter Twenty-Four MOBAM BA " BuT , Marnia . . . this is madness ! " Shackleton 's voice rang , firmly protesting . " We 're not going to the Inner Valley . We 're going back to the Ledge . " " We 're not going to the Ledge . " Her hand was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moonlight no fear or alarm , only a vivid , intense aliveness and eagerness . " Not now ; later , perhaps . But now we are going to the Valley where my father 's treasure is . " Treasure ? What fresh folly was this ? Who could tell how long the blacks would remain obedient to the penance he had set them ? And , meanwhile , there were Schnitter and Carstensen and the horrible black woman . " We must get out of this place while we have time , " Shackleton said , with great quietness . " There is danger all about us . . . great danger . All the treasure in the world could not repay us for the risk . " " We are going to the Valley , " she said again . The words fell one by one from her lips  --  lightly , even gaily . " Come . " " Marnia  --  you will come with me  --  now . " He took hold of her arm with a firm restraining hand . There was a low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , was regarding him with eyes that warned . " You see ? " Martha said , still in that light , inconsequential tone . " I say we are not going back . And Somba  | says so . We are going into the Valley for the treasure . It is my treasure now . We will take of it what we like , then we will go . " " Marnia ! Marnia ! what is treasure now ? " " It is power , " she said , as though surprised that he should ask . " Do n't you remember ? You said that to me , long ago . It is all the things men in that other world give their lives to possess . First we will get it ; then we will go . " He knew himself to be completely in her power . Marnia , in cutting the cords that bound him , made him more a captive than before . She spoke now to the Ape . " Go before  --  to the Valley . " She turned and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out her hand to Shackleton . " Come . " The moonlight flooded the way with silver . The brightness of it , the silence after the din and shouting of the natives , the girl 's hand in his , drawing him , the great beast lumbering before them  --  all these gave Shackleton a sense that he was moving in a world of fantastic unreality . And quite in keeping with that world , a shadow moved suddenly across their path . A shadow that took form and solidity . A shadow that rose slowly upright  --  a shadow that was Toolumbo . His two hands clasped the glittering body of Cleopatra tight against his chest . Above them his eyes stared , round I V and wondering , at his master and the witch-girl and the gigantic Yellow Ape . " What are you doing here ? " Shackleton 's grip fell on his shoulder . " You hurt me , " said Toolumbo in a very little voice , " as I would not hurt my lizard. "  | " You are to go back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind worked quickly . " You are not to leave Bimbi and Flower-of-the-Gourd again . You are to say to them that I have gone into the Inner Valley for the treasure . You are to say that I will come again very soon . " He underwent a moment 's misgiving lest the boy should not be able to remember his commands . He bent and looked sharply into the uplifted face . " Toolumbo , do you understand ? " Toolumbo nodded solemnly twice . " I am to tell Flower-of-the-Gourd that the witch-girl and my master have gone into the Valley for treasure , " he repeated . " That 's it , " Shackleton said . He released his hold on him . " Do not forget . Now go . " Like a sprite of the moonlit jungle Toolumbo ducked under a palm frond and was gone . As he went , Cleopatra gave a little protesting squirm in his hands , from being held so tightly . " Come , " Marnia said again . They had reached the entrance to the canyon . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not penetrate . " Stay close , Somba , " Marnia said . She followed the Ape and guided Shackleton along the twisted , stony way and across the bridge that spanned the sulphur spring . The black cliffs rose before them . The moonlight , flooding them , showed in startling relief the dark maws of the caves that honeycombed them . In those caves nothing stirred . No eerie chattering swelled out of the dark . No terrible ape faces leaned , peered . The cliffs were fantastically silent and empty .  | " We will go on to where the treasure is , " Marnia said . She quickened her step . " Soon you will see . " At another word of command Somba turned toward the Valley 's eastern wall . The two followed . Shackleton 11 took a quick look at the temple , magnificent and portentous in the moonlight . They began to climb . " Somba shall wait for us while we go in , " Marnia said . " He will help us with the stone door . Then we will send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The door ? " Shackleton repeated , dully . He had not thought directly of the hiding-place of the treasure , since that day when Marnia had started to take them to it and he had seen the hand of Schnitter on the rock below . " Yes , " Marnia explained . " The treasure chamber has a stone door . It has no lock , but it is very heavy . But Somba is so powerful he can open it for us . " Under the intensity of the moonlight the whole Valley seemed to quiver . The little licking tongues of fire that writhed along the ridge seemed to bow and raise themselves , bow and raise themselves in homage to the moon . The formidable temple portico , upborne by those three massive ape figures , seemed to be waiting  --  waiting for the moment when the moon would walk serenely between its columns ; when it would sweep its pale hand across those terrible carvings that told of man 's union with the brute race from which he sprang ; when it would illumine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with I'I sacrificial blood in honour of the Ape-god . So the temple waited  --  waited for the priests and the worshippers who would come no more . But something else was coming . Another priest  --  other  | worshippers . Again the temple was thronged . The ape figures that were its columns had given birth . The shadows of its aisles had brought forth more shadows  --  huge , hairy , black shadows with monstrous ape faces and heavy ape shoulders and long , terrible ape arms swinging before them . Hundreds and hundreds of apes , spawn of the cliffs . A press of black brute bodies , silent and motionless , crowding the temple . The moon had come shyly first , then with gathering courage , she had stepped beneath the dark portico . The waiting worshippers stirred . A single figure , a priestess at once of the world of beasts and of the world of men , disclosed herself . Black and naked , Mobamba stepped into the pool of still moonlight in the open space before the portico . She called , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a faint chattering sound answered her . She called again . Then her call sank to a heavy chuckle , a primitive , obscene laughter , that seemed to well out of the depths of man 's beginnings . In response to this the Apes emerged , surging , from the temple . As though Mobamba had called to all the remote brute things in them the great creatures which had held themselves upright like men , dropped suddenly to all fours . They began creeping toward her , creeping  --  creeping  --  horrible and intent as only brute beasts creep . When they came to her some of them fawned and licked her feet ; then her body . Again the terrible laughter . Mobamba raised her webbed hands . The beasts rose with them . She swayed , the apes swayed . She stepped forward and aside , the ape-tide surged forward . It swayed and receded . It lunged forward , weaving itself upon itself , obedient to her and to some unheard rhythm , in a mockery of dance .  | Great , sprawling ape bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entwined ; leering ape faces thrust forward ; terrible ape lips drawn back over gleaming ape teeth in a pleased , clownish grin . Sottish and uncouth , so the beast dancers caracoled in a long lumbering festoon after Mobamba . The heavy ill padding of their feet on the stones was the only sound . In and out about the portico of the temple they danced , 11 circling those gigantic stone apes like a ponderous black garland . Schnitter , crouching low behind a fallen column , gripped Carstensen 's sleeve . The sweat stood out on his forehead . His tongue was thick between his teeth . Fl " Mein Gott ! " he muttered . " I never bargained for anything like this . " He remembered what his mother had told him about the Brocken . About Walpurgis Nacht . But nothing ever was like this . . . . " She 's a-doing it ! " Carstensen 's voice came hoarsely , but with a note of pride . " She 's got ' em . Good old girl ! Good Mobamba ! " Madder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arms were flung out ; bodies leaped . Above the hastened pad , pad of heavy feet Mobamba 's laughter rose in a high , shrill falsetto . Carstensen spoke again : " They 're too busy now to notice anything you and me 'll do . We 'll shift out of this . We 'll start our prospectin ' . " He moved from their hiding-place . Schnitter followed . Bent , crouching as apes crouch , the two men crept stealth- II , 1 , ily away from the temple . In the clean open moonlight Schnitter drew a breath of relief . " I thought I 'd never get out . I thought I was havin ' them . The D.Ts. "  | Carstensen kept sternly to the business in hand . " Which way was the girl and Shackleton headed that time you seen them here ? " he demanded . Schnitter turned his head . He pointed . " Over that way . " " Then we 'll make for there . " Schnitter 's poise had come back to him . He had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But of that world , half beast , half man , that world with which Mobamba was in league . . . a man could n't stomach that . " Ca n't clear out too fast to suit me , " he said . Now he took the lead . The two moved across the barren centre of the Valley toward the mountain from whose summit the fires played . As they neared the slope he paused , looking up . He threw up his hand . " Wait ! " he said . " Do you see anything up there along the cliff ? " " Seems like I do . " Carstensen peered along the treacherous moonlighted rocks above them . His eyes focussed on something dark that stood , huge and motionless , beside a'darker aperture in the cliff . " It 's a beast or something . " " It 's the Yellow Ape . The girl 's Ape . " Schnitter 's forehead wrinkled itself back to meet his hair as though it , not his lips , laughed . " Then the girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure ! We 'll have her , too . " Over Carstensen 's mind doubt cast its shadow . The Yellow Ape . If it was there , on guard , then they could n't get in . Were they to be balked of the treasure now ? No ! He lifted his revolver . A shot rang out .  | Chapter Twenty-Five MARNIA WINS GoLD ! Gold ! The heavy , dull gleam of it filled the chamber . It lay gathered in pools in the hollows of the floor . It rose in bright billows along the walls and about the wooden pillars that supported the roof . It was a moment before Shackleton 's eyes could take in more than the rich , shining colour of the metal . And the amount of it ! He had never imagined so much gold in all the world before . " You see now . " Marnia 's voice at his side seemed strangely dispassionate in the presence of that barbaric splendour . " This is the treasure . Is it enough ? " He did not answer her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a wondering eye , along the array of that stupendous wealth . It was only then that he began to see the shapes and forms of that treasure  --  pieces of archaic armour , all of gold , shields and bucklers , jewelled gorgets , belts and swords and curiously fashioned helmets , such as Darius might have envied ; massive gold trays and salvers , ewers and basins , caskets and shapely urns , lamps and candlesticks of rich antique design . There were , too , one or two strangely modelled chairs , and a couch of some dark wood , heavily overlaid with gold . The wealth of a people long in dust .  | The beam of his flash brought out of the darkness a tall , slender tripod of gold that supported a brazier . " Wait , " Marnia said . " When I came before I had a torch . I remember I left it here . " She put into Shackleton 's hand a short torch of some resinous wood . " Igor made it for me . " Shackleton lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brazier . Its flame flashed and glowed and smouldered on the golden magnificence that surrounded them . Marakoff 's treasure ! The treasure of the Lost People ! The ancient dwellers in the Valley had made the hidingplace with jealous care . They had hollowed it deep into the solid rock . They had strengthened the vaulted roof with pillars of mahogany , and these they had painted in bold , gorgeous designs of crimson and green and blue . And here they had gathered their wealth  --  gold upon gold . And here  --  stronger , more enduring than man ? that treasure had remained , unknown save to Marakoff and to Marakof-f 's daughter . A hoard of smaller , glittering objects , piled about one of the pillars , had drawn Marnia 's attention  --  women 's adornments  --  bracelets and anklets and cinctures and exoticlooking golden head-dresses strung with pearls . Marnia bent over them . The great opal which she wore swung away from her breast as though in greeting to its own . " I never cared before to wear any of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet women did wear them once . " Shackleton stooped beside her . Under the spell of that heaped splendour he had forgotten the dangers from which they had escaped , forgotten , too , his former anxiety  | as to what lay ahead of them before they could reach the Ledge , and the passage through the Black Caves , to safety . " Yes , " he said , quietly , but with a kind of stilled excitement in his tone , " women wore these once  --  the women of the Lost People . " " What were they like ? " Marnia asked . Shackleton 's eyes went to her . All her high imperiousness had vanished . She was suddenly thoughtful . There was about her now , too , a kind of gentleness . And this moved him strangely . Where did she get her witcheries ? What were they ? Surely they were not alone her beauty . There were deeper powers in her . She was more than Marnia  --  more even than the daughter of Marakoff  --  the daughter , rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful , " he said , slowly , and not taking his eyes from her . " As beautiful and as strange as you are , Marnia . " A little smile played now about her lips . " Am I beautiful , then ? " She had taken up a heavy gold bracelet studded with turquoises . She was lowering and raising it along her arm ? her slender , silver-white arm ! It seemed to him as though the very spirit of beauty played idly with the crude , the barbaric . " Marnia , " he heard himself saying , " take it off . Put it away . " " Why ? " She looked at him with astonishment . " Because your arm is lovelier without it . " She put it aside quite willingly . - It occurred to him how willing she was to accept completely whatever he said . It was natural enough . Except Igor , who had held such a different relation to her , he was the only one in her life . And he had brought her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever was to be hers must come to her through him . He was only just fully awake to the realization of this , but she had known it fully , and accepted it from the beginning . A certain unadmitted pride came to him . Yes , she would be what he made her , until the world took her finally from him and she became the subject of many people 's teachings . He moved away from her , to examine further the riches . He saw then that besides the stone door that guarded the treasure chamber from the outer cave , and which Marnia had called Somba to open for them , there was , at the rear of the chamber , another door . It opened on massive iron hinges . Behind it , his flashlight showed him a second , smaller room , hollowed out of the rock . But it was empty . Marnia 's voice called him back from examining this . " Come ! There is something I want you to open . " She had moved aside several gold trays that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I tried , when I came before , to lift the lid , " she said , , but I could not . " Shackleton bent over it . It took all his strength to raise the weight of the cover . Within the dark chest something sparkled and flashed and glowed under the torchlight . Light itself , it seemed , broken as through a prism . It gave back a hundred bits of singing colour  --  topaz , sapphire , ruby , and emerald . Jewels ! The chest was filled with them . Marnia laughed exultantly . " We 'll take these , " she said . " The other things are too heavy . " She reached both her hands into the chest and brought them up full of the gems . She motioned to Shackleton to open his pockets to receive them . " They will be mine , " she said . " They will give me
