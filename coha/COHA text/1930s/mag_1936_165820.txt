In a week which was trying to many British businessmen ( see col. 3 ) , the nation as a whole was cheered to have its faith in the British Navy renewed by Sir Samuel ( " Flying Sam " ) Hoare , who , as First Lord of the British Admiralty , has been increasingly often mentioned as one of two or three statesmen with a real chance of becoming Prime Minister . Sir Samuel would certainly know , reasons the average Englishman , whether there is any validity in the rumors that Air Power has now outmoded Sea Power . This onetime Air Minister was Foreign Secretary when Benito Mussolini faced down British ships in the Mediterranean ( TIME , Sept. 30 , 1935 ) , knows diplomacy , the air , the sea . <P> " I hope no future Foreign Secretary will ever be put in the position in which I found myself , " said the First Lord last week at Edinburgh . " That state of affairs must never occur again ! " To remedy it the Admiralty will build more warships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentously that the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defense , appointed to probe the " bombers v. battle ships " controversy , has now unanimously recommended against the substitution of fighting aircraft for British capital ships . " When the country hears more of the question , " summed up Sir Samuel , " there will be no two opinions among impartial people ! " <P> More good news for Britons came in a speech to the 1912 Club by Sir Henry Page-Croft : " There has been much windy talk that if another war takes place it will ' end civilization . ' This of course is sheer nonsense . Even if London were subjected to a pitiless hail of bombs and gas , it is childish to imagine that such frightfulness would be the end of England , much less the end of the British Empire .
