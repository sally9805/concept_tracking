txt Secret Service agents , acting on a search warrant obtained by Lamar Hardy , United States Attorney , swooped down yesterday on half a dozen banks and safe deposit companies , and finally located 10,000 $20 gold pieces for which they had been hunting quietly for several weeks . The gold , which is said to have a present market value as metal of $338,600 , was found in a vault registered in the name of Zelik Josefowitz at the Chemical Safe Deposit Company at 32 Liberty Street , di-1 rectly opposite the Federal Reserve Bank . Neither Mr. Hardy nor the agents would reveal the identity of the depositor , but according to William H. Houghton , head of the Secret Service , members of the man 's famfly recently cabled " a similar sum " 1 to Switzerland , and its ultimate objective is believed to have been Germany . Ferdinand Claussen , vice president of the safe deposit company , said last night that Josefowitz and two other members of his family . whose names he could not recall , rented the vault through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust Company " in 1932 . The Josefowitzes themselves , he said , are citizens of Lausanne , Switzerland , and none of them had ever had personal access to the vault . Officials here and in Washington declined to comment upon the report that Secret Service agents had also found $2,000,000 on deposit under the name of Josefowitz . The seizure is the largest made here since the President signed his order of Aug. 28 , 1933 , calling in all gold under provisions of the Emergency Banking Act of the same year . Treasury officials in Washington explained , however , that the seizure was made not under that act but under Section 4 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 , which states that any gold acquired or withheld , transported , melted or treated in violation of the act or regulations or licenses issued under it " shall be forfeited to the United States , and may be seized and condemned by like proceedings as those provided by law for the forfeiture , seizure and condemnation of property im- ported into the United States contrary to law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also provides that any person failing to comply with the provisions of the act or any regulations or licenses issued under it shall be subject to a penalty equal to twice the value of the gold found . No other penalty is attached to a violation . Violation of the Emergency Banking Act , however , is punishable by a fine of $10,000 or ten years ' imprisonment , the maximum penalty . J. Randall Creel , Assistant United States Attorney , is in charge of the investigation here . He declined to furnish any information about the seizure for fear of embarrassing the government 's case . It is the understanding of bankers , on the basis of previous Treasury rulings , that a foreigner holding gold here that was acquired prior to the bank holiday may sell it to his own central bank , which may then earmark it at the Federal Reserve Bank . One of the mysteries that no one cleared up is why , if that understanding is correct , Josefowitz did not sell the gold to his own central bank . Mr. Houghton and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said , until after they had hunted for the gold unsuccessfully in " half a dozen banks and safe deposit companies . " The process of counting and recounting the 10,000 coins consumed three hours , Mr. Houghton said . The depositor was represented by three attorneys , he said , who stood by the vault when it was opened and watched the counting . " It took so long to count , " he added , " because every time we grabbed a coin we felt like holding on to it . " Mr. Houghton contributed to the atmosphere of mystery surrounding the seizure . Asked how he had traced the coin , to the safe deposit company , he said : " You know about the starlings that fly ' round and round . Well , one of them hopped onto my window sill at the custom house . " Mr. Houghton said that he was not looking for Josefowitz . " Now that we have the gold , he 'll come forth , wo n't he ? " he asked . Mr. Houghton did not amplify his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar sum " of money , not gold , however , to Switzerland , and that it was his theory that the money had found its way to Germany . Asked if its ultimate destination might not have been Italy , he said : " Your guess is as good as mine . " The seized gold was taken to the assay office .
