" Education in the U. S. is a beggar with a tin cup ! " <P> " The U. S. school is the forgotten institution ! " <P> " Save our schools ! " <P> So educators have wailed at the top of their lungs since early in Depression . On Government and public they have rained a constant barrage of statistics , growing steadily more formidable . By now 5,000 schools are closed and school terms shortened in one of every four U. S. cities &; towns ; $40,000,000 in back salaries is owed to 40,000 teachers ; 100,000 teachers are unemployed : school enrollments have upped 960,000 while school revenues were falling $150,000,000 ; school building expenditures are down 80% , textbook purchases down 30% . <P> But statistics are cold and the same cry from the same voices soon falls on deaf ears . Last week educators tried a new tack when they got many a famed citizen to take up their cause at a " Citizens Conference on the Crisis in Education , " sponsored by Ohio State University at Columbus . <P> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relief Administration funds had been set aside to keep rural schools open took some of the wind from the conference 's sails but none of the thunder from speakers ' voices . Sounded were the same protests against school economies , the same warnings of national disaster which have been heard at every educators ' conference for the past three years . " It is quite as important to balance the nation 's life as to balance the nation 's budget , " cried University of Wisconsin 's President Glenn Frank . " It is quite as important to prevent a social deficit for the future as to wipe out a financial deficit in the present . " <P> Senator Royal S. Copeland of New York was on hand with his favorite crime statistics . Crime costs the nation $13,000,000,000 per year , said he . " Cut crime 20% , " declared Senator Copeland , " and teachers can be paid decent salaries , 3,500,000 children can go back to school and 300,000 families can move out of depressing hovels into sanitary , sun-lit homes . " His remedy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with one gangster , a thousand criminals are in the making . We pluck leaves from the tree of crime when we should put an axe to the root . " <P> Amid the familiar pleas and protests of educators ' conferences , observers noted one significant difference . With the breakdown of local support , educators have turned almost unanimously to cry for Federal subsidy . Last week conferring citizens were inclined to think that Education 's salvation lay in the State . Echoed by Indiana 's Governor Paul V. McNutt , Citizen Alfred E. Smith called ( by proxy ) for State support of schools , warned against Federal control . Wrote he : " It is axiomatic in American Government that control follows support . Men may cry Federal aid without Federal control but so declaring does not determine the outcome . . . . Whoever pays the fiddler calls the tune . "
