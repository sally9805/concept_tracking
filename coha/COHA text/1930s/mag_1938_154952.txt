THE TROUBLE WITH TIGERS - William Saroyan-Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> His fourth collection of short stories in two years , The Trouble With Tigers , continues William Saroyan 's noisy demand to be taken seriously . As he states it : " I am studying timeless and contemporary idiocy in man and in myself , and timeless and contemporary poise and dignity in beasts . plants , rocks , rivers , seas , and myself , and I am translating the universe , time and space , pneumatics , size , relativity , sleep , anger , despair , energy , motion , sound , texture , memory , and many other things into English . " <P> Saroyan 's cute childhood , his poverty , his poignant memory of every hamburger he ever ate , his nutty relatives-the subjects of most of his previous stories-are the subjects of about half of the 35 stories in The Trouble With Tigers . The other half-exhibiting Saroyan 's fiercest inhaling and exhaling to date-consists of stories about Hollywood and essays on the contemporary idiocy of Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer , Saroyan evidently studied up on Dostoyevsky and Whitman . <P> The Trouble With Tigers does one good thing : it settles the argument about what Saroyan 's writing is all about . " I have written one word , " he announces , " God . " Altogether he intends to write three . The second will be " Is . " The third : " Love . " The announcement of this program makes dawning sense , for if Saroyan appears in his stories in any consistent role , it is as a sort of humanist jumping jack , waiting only until he has written a few more Books of Saroyan to leap forward as a U. S. prophet .
