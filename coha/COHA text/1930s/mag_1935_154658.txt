Since Frenchmen know that thrifty President Franklin Delano Roosevelt has a fat little fortune , they would approve if in marrying off an only daughter he dowered her with 20% of it in tax-exempt bonds . Such was the ratio observed last week by shrewd , earthy , peasant-born Premier Pierre Laval when , like equally plebeian Premier Benito Mussolini , he prepared to marry off his Jos to a count . <P> Jos Laval , like Edda Mussolini , grew up her father 's pal . Since a Dictator can do more for a pal than a mere statesman , Edda made her debut with a tour of the Far East on which she was showered with gifts by many a potentate , later married baby-faced Count Galeazzo Ciano who was promptly advanced through Italy 's diplomatic service , and gradually promoted to his present rank of Minister for Press &; Propaganda . <P> Rome says that Edda 's dowry was 5,000,000 lire ( $410,000 ) . Last week Paris heard friends of Jose saying that her dowry will be 10,000,000 francs ( $662,000 ) or 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,310,000 ) . <P> Latin shrugs greet any query as to where Papa Mussolini and Pre Laval earned all that money . Both have airtight alibis . <P> Dictator Mussolini is a writer and what he is paid by the Hearst papers is supposed to be as great as his fame . He also owns Italy 's leading daily and his Government controls the Press . Monsieur Laval , as he says , is a lawyer . As fat fees have rolled in during the years , he has piled investment on shrewd investment , now owns several estates and a frowning medieval castle . <P> Also a lawyer is Jos Laval 's fianc , almost forgotten last week in the dither over her dowry . He , aristocratic young Count Ren de Chambrun , is a nephew of the late , great Nicholas Longworth , a descendant of the Marquis de Lafayette . <P> Convening at Nancy last week members of the National Alliance for Increasing the Population of France , which recently cracked down on U. S. " Slave Dancer " Joan Warner ( TIME , July 22 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adopted a resolution of " hope that after her marriage to Count Ren de Chambrun she will have many children .
