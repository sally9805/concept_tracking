BY November 30 , 1935 , Samuel Langhorne Clemens would have been a hundred years old . Listen , before we expatiate , to these two anecdotes . I have one at first hand and was present at the telling of the other . In the days before he was a bishop the Rev. William Doane went one Sunday to preach in Hartford , and Mark Twain was in the church . After the service he lingered to meet the clergyman and say with what interest and pleasure he had heard him , adding that , most strangely , every word of the sermon was in a book he had at home . The Reverend Mr. Doane was appalled . They spoke of unconscious plagiarism and looked at the coincidence from various angles . On taking his leave Mark Twain offered to send the book round to Mr. Doane 's hotel , which offer was eagerly accepted . The parcel arrived and on being untied out came the dictionary . That must have been during the seventies . Mark Twain was rising forty , and married . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His gallant lecture journey round the world was over , his heavy load of debt paid off by the sole exertion of his genius ; he was a world figure and sixty years old . His hair , like the foaming crest of a breaker , was going to be snow white before long , but his eyes were hot and bright and young . Who could forget them ? Blue fire under bushy brows , steady when he fixed them on you , inquiring , penetrating , fierce , and genial at the same time . He was living in New York , but he referred to Hartford in a little while . Had I been writing anything new ? he asked . I had just finished a story , " Sharon 's Choice , " suggested by certain real events . The citizens of Sharon had voted the prize for school elocution to a small boy in spite of his speaking like nothing at all ? voted it tumultuously over the heads of the appointed judges , upsetting their decision , because the small boy 's father had recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; still more recently his mother had turned out to be a dope fiend ; his aunt , who had taken him to raise , had the personality of a decayed tooth ; and only two days before the prize speaking the boy had experimented with the couplings of a freight train and parted with three of his fingers . " And do you know , " I said to Mark Twain , " when my informant piled those fingers on top of that load of calamity , my overcharged sympathy exploded and I just roared . " To this Mark Twain had listened with piercing attention . He now sprang up and shot out his arm at me . " I know what you mean , " he exclaimed . " Just what you mean ! " And with that he was striding back and forth , talking in a stream more and more impetuously . " It was on a Sunday up at Hartford some years ago , " he began . And this was what he told me : A missionary preached that morning . His voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he pleaded for help with such moving simplicity that Mark Twain mentally doubled the fifty cents he had intended to put in the plate . As the address proceeded , describing so pitifully the misery of the savages , the dollar in his mind gradually rose to five . A little farther along , the missionary had him crying . He felt that all the cash he carried about him would be insufficient and decided to write a large check . " And then that preacher went on , " said Mark Twain , suddenly whirling on me and coining to a standstill , and falling into a drawl , " went on about the dreadful state of those natives . I abandoned the idea of the check . And he went on . And I got back to five dollars , four , two , one . But he went on . And when the plate came round ? I took ten cents out of it . " Later in that visit Mark Twain was striding up and down again , whirling on me once in a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scowl , and the mound of hair all of a piece with the electric total of the man . But this time Zola was the subject , he was wholly serious , very concentrated ; and I shall come back to it . In any case , I should have told you these anecdotes ; but my chief point is not that I think them worth telling ; I believe if they had been told without names to any American boy or man forty years ago , and the boy or man had been asked to guess who it was , he would have guessed right . There was a twist , a tang , a something the community had come to recognize as being particularly Mark Twain 's . Alreadythe Jumping Frog had leaped round the world , the Innocents Abroad had followed it , Bemis and his buffalo were known to everyone who had read Roughing It . At school we repeated with zest that whimsical passage about Horace Greeley 's having to make a speech at Placerville , and the stage driver , Hank Monk , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I remember how we enjoyed it then ! I read it over the other day and enjoyed it at seventy-four as much as I did at fifteen . There was nobody like Mark Twain . We said it in the seventies , we say it now ; and , as an eminent painter observed to me , one of his outstanding qualities is that he interests you as much when you are grown up as he did when you were a boy . But is there nobody like Mark Twain ? And was there nobody ? Will Rogers makes me think of him . A certain essence which I will call the true American essence , flavors his remarks ? precisely the same which flavors Mark Twain 's complaint that " Everybody is talking about the weather , but nobody seems to do anything about it , " or his reply to a friend who asked where was he going for the summer : to Europe on five hundred dollars the plumber did n't know he had . This essence lurked in him to the end . Professors have defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great number of Americans have possessed it ? Lincoln , for instance ? as well as unknown thousands who never wrote anything or spoke a recorded word , but who emotionally vibrated to it , and made a nation-wide audience for those whose public utterance it inspired . It was n't only what they had to say , but also the way they said it . II The mood of an epoch sets its stamp on men 's faces and upon what they over the Spanish Armada . The island was all exultant patriotism and intellectual excitement . Abraham Lincoln was born in 1809 and died in 1865 . He did not look like John Adams . Few of that type remained . But a new type had appeared , and Lincoln is an example of it ? the lean , keen , agile product of roughing it ; the man on the lookout for Indians as he walked beside his west-bound wagon , cracking his blacksnake whip , or hewed logs for his cabin , or cleared a patch for his corn and his still . Pioneers , 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The face of many , many soldiers on both sides in our Civil War . The face we see generalized in Uncle Sam . He 's with us still , is Uncle Sam ; but how many of him would you see if you walked and walked in New York all day Long ? Commercialism and Ellis Island have driven him into the quiet and rustic hills . And we have a new type of the epode ? the face of the fat apple . An indoor face . That epoch , that Lincoln era , as you might call it , since it pretty nearly began with Lincoln 's life and ended with it , was the era of our jubilant adolescence . Bonaparte had sold Louisiana to Jefferson six years before Lincoln 's birth . Lewis and Clarke next had explored the red man 's continent that the white man was to take . Next , Jackson won the battle of New Orleans . And what did the exulting American spirit do ? Did it think ? Not at all . It did n't have to . That has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Westward the star of Empire took its way , at times very much like a fire-cracker ; and the new epoch began to write with a pen of its own , often a quill from a pigeon-wing . Let no one confront me with Edgar Allan Poe , and inquire if I discover pigeon-wings and the battle of New Orleans to be latent in his prose and verse . Poe is not the only figure outside that picture as well as outside the New England group . These exceptions perform their proverbial office . " Now and then on the stream of time , " says Mark Twain , " small gobs of that thing which we call genius drift down , and a few of those lodge at some particular point , and others collect about them and make a sort of intellectual island ? a towhead as we say on the river ? such an accumulation we call a group , or school , and name it . " Yes , indeed . And the particular point at which these towheads have often lodged is the moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . You will easily recall other towheads beside that in which Shakespeare overtops the rest so far that he dwarfs every one of his fellow-dramatists . The whole nineteen were born after 1550 and before 1600 , all felt the elation of the Renaissance and the thrill of the Armada . This rings through the most superb outburst of passion for one 's native soil that I know in any literature ? Lancaster 's speech in " Richard II " : Oh , who has ever equalled that ? But who else has ever been Shakespeare ? And Mark Twain could suppose that Bacon wrote that ! It 's another point I shall come back to . All our native group , to which Mark Twain stands as Shakespeare stood to Marlowe and the rest ( I am not making a comparison but suggesting an analogy ) , were born in the middle of the Lincoln era . The earliest , John Phoenix ( I use the names they wrote or lectured under ) in 1823 ; Petroleum V. Nasby ten years later ; Artemus Ward in 1834 ; Bret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West ; they were born in Massachusetts , Maine , New York ; but how little any of them resembles Emerson , Hawthorne , Longfellow , Whittier , Lowell , Holmes ! ? that other group , also native , but regional , rather than nationwide in its scope . You must add Josh Billings , Bill Nye , Ambrose Bierce , Eugene Field , James Whitcomb Riley , and John Flay to the Mark Twain group ; H. C. Bunner , Frank Stockton , and 0 . Henry were postscripts . Much that each of them wrote or spoke differed individually from the work of others ; yet certain fragments could belong to any of them , came from the pen of the epoch , were spiced with the same Lincolnian essence which flavored brains and veins from the Atlantic to the Pacific . When Mark Twain cabled from Europe that the report of his death was grossly exaggerated , you have it triple distilled . In his San Francisco days Mark Twain might have written John Phoenix 's anecdote of the dentist , Dr. Tushmaker , published almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man came to have a tooth out . When Dr. Tushmaker pulled , it did n't come ; but the patient 's right leg went up . " Whydo you do that ? " asked the dentist . " Because I can not help it , " replied the man . " Come back in a week and I will attend to you . " During the week the doctor invented an instrument combining the properties of the lever , the screw , the wedge , the hammer , and the inclined plane . One turn of the crank , and out came the tooth . Its roots were hooked under the patient 's right big-toe , his whole skeleton was extracted with the tooth , and he had to be sent home in a pillow-case . Artemus Ward said that Harvard College was pleasantly situated in the Parker House , School Street , Boston . In the darkest hours of the Civil War , Lincoln would read Artemus Ward aloud to his Cabinet and laugh . Lincoln said it was had to swap horses while crossing a stream . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both of them . Bret Harm wrote the " Heathen Chinee . " Again the essence ; and do n't you remember his parody of Victor Hugo in Condensed Novels ? And this ? No need to labor the point . The writings of the others will easily disclose you many specimens which in spirit match one another , and do not match anything else . " Prattle , " the column contributed once by Ambrose Bierce to The Sun Francisco Examiner , is full of this spirit , more corrosive ; it is present in some of his sulphuric stories . Just two instances more . Bob Burdette wrote of an election bet paid him in a box of cigars . " They were the awfullest cigars , " he says , and gives an impression of them , ending by his lighting one , pointing it at a dog , and the dog turns to stone . This theme of the bad cigar is treated less fantastically by Mark Twain ? but then , he is dictating his reminiscences ; fact is present , it is only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George brought the box . . . and began to pass them around . The conversation had been brilliantly animated up to that moment ? but now a frost fell upon the company . That is to say , not all of a sudden , but the frost fell upon each man as he took up a cigar and held it poised in the air ? and there , in the middle , his sentence broke off . And that kind of thing went all around the table , until , when George had completed his crime the whole place was full of a thick solemnity and silence . " Then he tells how , one by one , each guest after a few puffs rises and explains that he has an important engagement and leaves the house . And then , next morning , George brings him his cup of coffee , and asks : " Mr. Clemens , how far is it from the front door to the upper gate ? " I said , " It is one hundred and twenty-five steps . " He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front door and you can go plumb to the upper gate and tread on one of them cigars every time . " III You will notice how vivid he makes that scene of the smokers ; whatever he describes , you ca n't help seeing it instantly . His eye unerringly registers details , his selective sense picks out the right ones , the image starts to life ; his inveterate humor does not distort the picture , merely intensifies it . In A Tramp Abroad he has been scolding Harris , his private agent , for larding an account of the Furka Pass with foreign words . The criticism , fantastically conveyed , is the soundest common sense ; and then he describes the effect of the scolding upon Harris : " When the musing spider steps upon the red-hot shovel , he first exhibits a wild surprise , then he shrivels up . . . . I can be dreadfully rough on a person when the mood takes me . " Even when his fancy is executing its loftiest pigeon-wings the realism somehow is not disturbed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Tramp Abroad lie places some observations about blue jays in the mouth of an old California miner . " There 's more to a blue jay than any other creature . He has got more moods , and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures ; and , mind you , whatever a blue jay feels , he can put into language And another thing : I 've noticed a good deal , and there 's no bird , or cow , or anything that uses as good grammar as a blue jay . You may say a cat uses good grammar . Well , a cat does ? but you let a cat get excited once ; you let a cat get pulling fur with another cat on a shed , nights , and you 'll hear grammar that will give you the lock-jaw . Ignorant people think it 's the noise which fighting cats make that is so aggravating , but it ai n't so ; it 's the sickening grammar they use . . . . Now on top of all this there 's another thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You think a cat can swear . Well , a cat can ; but you give a blue jay a subject that calls for reserve powers , and where is your cat ? " That laughter was expected , and for a long while laughter only , from whatever Mark Twain wrote , is quite natural when you remember that he made his first appearance with The Jumping Frog . There ran a very different thread beneath , destined to be uppermost in after years . Plenty of seriousness can be found in The Innocents Abroad ; but it was such passages as his finding the tomb of Adam at Jerusalem which caught the appreciation of his readers . " The tomb of Adaml How touching it was , here in a land of strangers , far away from home , and friends , and all who cared for me , thus to discover the grave of a blood relation . . . I leaned upon a pillar and burst into tears . . . . Noble old man ? he did not live to see me . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sawyer were not at first perceived to be better portraits of their periodthan any history has been . I remember ( and this was during the nineties ) telling a clear old clergyman who had taught me Greek , Latin , and English twenty years before , that Mark Twain was a great writer and a master of style . He was utterly astonished . I sent him Life on the Mississippi . It converted him . He was precisely the cultivated , delicate , civilized American of college tradition and gentle background whom the spirit of Innocents Abroad shocked . That class of Americans bowed down too low to Europe and all her works ; with them whatever was European was right . Innocents Abroad was a sort of Declaration of Independence in matters aesthetic , and in several other matters too ; the comment of a strong , original , raw , voraciously inquiring mind suddenly confronted with the civilized , complicated Past . Now and then it got his back up . In consequence he was too sweeping , and remained so . Do you remember his furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composer of that opera , made by Bill . Nye , delighted him . " I am told that Wagner 's music is better than it sounds . " Well , that is certainly delightful : Nye and Clemens were chips of the same American block . Do you remember what Mark Twain says about St. Mark 's of Venice ? Or his wholesale scorn and rejection of the Old Masters ? Do you remember his remarks about the " divine Hair Trunk of Bassano " ? He will take no man 's valuation but his own for Titian , Tintoretto , Giotto ? anybody . Indeed , he seldom takes it for anything , till in middle life he adopts W. D. Howells as his literary mentor . Beneath his genius , realistic and humorous , lies changeless independence of judgment . I think it is the foundation of his nature , the root of his upstanding moral and intellectual integrity . But it does n't seem to have struck him that other people may have been occasionally right . Very American , this , of its epoch ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and defied it to show us anything there as good as everything here . Mark Twain never lived on close terms with either art or letters . At sixty-eight Walter Scott becomes known to him , and he is amazed that such artificial trash should be admired until he reads and likes Quentin Durward . He speaks of paintings by their area and the number of figures in them . Of that folk melody , the " Lorelei , " he says : " I could not endure it at first , but by and by it began to take hold of me , and now there is no tune that I like so well . " No wonder that Wagner had small chance with him . What would he have had to say about the B-minor Mass ? Later in life , he owned a music machine whose sounds were agreeable to him ; certain operas gave him pleasure ; but I find no record of his attendance at symphony concerts . And although he came to examine and sometimes to read and to write about various hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the didactic or reforming or protesting element in his character , his hostility to sham , his passion for justice . The pretensions of Christian Science , Dowden 's too indulgent Life of Shelley ? these stirred up his militant spirit , and both his satire and his humor were poured out on them . You must keep in mind his partially New England blood and the dismal prayers he was taught . But ? he believed and said that Bacon wrote Shakespeare . If he ever read the works of either , to the quality of both he was stone blind . It is utterly impossible to know these two authors and suppose them identical . As sensible as to say that Darwin wrote Vanity Fair . I do n't believe Shakespeare interested him in the least . He doesn'trefer to him with any intimacy ; when he sees " King Lear " played in German all that he speaks of is the thunder and lightning . Susan , his daughter , felt that he would have been better for " advantages " in his youth . Advantages , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have saved him from that pitfall which lies in the path of burlesque ? the overdoing of a bright idea , too much elaboration , such as his Alpine ascent and his French duel in A Tramp Abroad . I 'm not very sorry that he never went to college . Oxford gave him a degree , after all . Suppose Hawthorne had been born in Florida , Missouri , and Mark Twain in Salem , Massachusetts . That is something I have squandered some meditation upon . You will notice that the problem of evil preoccupied one of them all his life , the other in his later years , and that both wrote masterpieces on that dark theme . You will readily recall Young Goodman Brown and The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg . I said earlier in this paper that Mark Twain talked to me about Zola . It was not about Zola 's merits or defects or his position in literature ; it was the latitude which French conventions allowed novelists . Did I remember the beginning of La Terre , where a young girl takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did I remember this and that and the other in the same book ? Such doings could n't be described here . That sort of thing was n't confined to France ; it was human , universal in rustic Life ; but American taste would n't stand its being so much as hinted at . Long before he said this to me , he had written it in A Tramp Abroad , from another angle . He speaks of what you see in picture galleries and adds : " But suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly things ? the critics would skin him alive . " So here is evidence that Mark Twain had felt hampered , and had resented it ; but not sufficient ground , I think , for the contention of Mr. Van Wyck Brooks ( quite the most remarkable critic of his generation ) that this suppression of his creative force by Calvinistic hypocrisy and the over-cautious advice of Mr. Howellsis the sole secret of the gloom which darkened his later years . Undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Court of Elizabeth . A similar explosion burst from Eugene Field . All writers suffered . When once I proposed a Western tale of passion gone wrong to the editor of Harper 's ! Weekly , he threw up both hands and gasped , " Nothing about sex ! " Well , too little about it is better than the whoredom of Hollywood . IV But if at t and letters counted little with Mark Twain , no author ever lived on closer terms with life . It must have begun in the cradle . I wish I knew what the neighbors in Florida and Hannibal thought of that boy . Probably that he would come to a bad end . He gives us a glimpse of himself at ten , sent to bed early on board a Mississippi steamboat , haunted with visions of wreck , snags , and bursting boilers , and later rushing in a scanty shirt to the ladies ' saloon with wild cries of fire , when a kind old lady stops her knitting and advises him to go and put on his breastpin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string of taunts he induces morbidly shy Jim Wolf , aged seventeen , to get out of bed , climb out on a steep roof covered with snow , and stop the noise of a couple of cats . He watches , hopeful and safe , from a window until Jim Wolf creeps near enough to make a grab at a cat , loses his balance , slides deleted material is able to withstand the shock ; Mark Twain 's The Mysterious Stranger is a talc by one in the bottomless pit of pessimism . We know also that he had been mortally wounded by grief ; and perhaps illness played a part . I think these several reasons combined are more likely to have evoked in him his hostile gloom than the single explanation advanced by Mr. Van Wyck Brooks . Well , Mark Twain and his literary kin were the direct product of a buoyant epoch , just as the rout of the Persians at Salamis produced the age of Pericles . I believe that what set in after our Civil War accounts for the change in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , as I have , that chapter in Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine 's admirable biography , where Clemens at sixty-seven returns to Hannibal and goes over all the old playgrounds and swimming places with the old men , the playmates who in the days of the Lincoln era had been Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn . You will be deeply moved , I think ; and you will see how alive were warmth and affection in that emotional spirit ; and you will wish that no cup of bitterness had ever touched his lips . For among all our writers he is not only the most interesting figure , but also the best beloved .
