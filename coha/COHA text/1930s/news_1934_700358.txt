txt Relieving Court Congestion . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES publishes the suggestion of the American Bar Association that more lawyers be employed in judicial capacities to relieve congestion in court calendars . Judging from what I have observed of courts while serving as a juror . I doubt the efficacy of the proposed remedy . My solution would be to ' install time clocks , and each month publish the records of attendance of the sitting judges . And why such lengthy vacations ? From what I observed , I should say that judges are very temperamental and that their court attendance is as uncertain as the winds . An ill-digested breakfast , a fine day for golf , the exigencies of politics , are , it seems , far more important than the state of one 's calendar . As the late-lamented Calvin would say , " Let 's see that our present help are fully earning their wages before we hire more . " EDWIN B. CALLAHAN . Boston , Mass .. Dec. 26 , 1933.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
