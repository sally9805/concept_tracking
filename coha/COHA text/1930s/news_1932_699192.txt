txt MISS Annie Teller , 92 years old , a descendant of John Quincy Adams , sixth President of the United States , died , yesterday in a tiny ball bedroom on the second floor at 166 East Thirty-second Street , overcome by gas that seeped from a break in a rubber hose attached to a heater . An old love story was one of Ithe reasons for the refusal of the little white-haired woman to live with her kin . For more than seventy years she had lived with strangers and during the last twenty years her neighbors were the poor folk of the east side tenement district . When John Connors , one of the neighbors ' sons , discovered the body and spread the news in the dingy halls , " Mother 's dead " ? they called her mother in the tenement where she had occupied the hall bedroom for the last two years  --  the neighbors clustered around the door and a few of the women wept. , " Mother " had been good to them . Father Served on Old Tronsides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putnam Valley , Putnam County . Her father was Elisha Teller , who , according to family legend , was on the frigate Constitution  --  Old Ironsides  --  with his brother , Pierre , at the bombardment of Tripoli in the war against the Barbary States in 1805 . Her mother was Betsy Ann Adams Teller , daughter of Asa Adams , a direct descendant of the President . In the old-fashioned trunk in the little hall bedroom the police found two certificates that set forth the qualifications of Annie Teller to teach the second grade of common school . Apparently she had treasured them . They had cracked from too much handling , but she had stitched them together with white thread . One of the licenses was issued by Commissioner Joseph Barrett in Westchester in 1866 , the other by Commissioner David A. Morrison of the First Common School District of Orange County in 1883 . Mrs. Joseph Nickerson of 41 Main Street , Dobbs Ferry , N. Y. , wife of Miss Teller 's nephew , said last night that Miss Teller had taught in other places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaica , Queens , from 1870 to 1883 ; taught in old Harlem when it was a comparative wilderness and was a teacher in the rural districts in Huron County , Ohio ; Croton Falls , N. Y. , and at Bedford Station , N. Y. When she retired in 1914 she had been a teacher fiftytwo years . Mrs. Nickerson and Mrs. Hana D. A. Barrett of Dobbs Ferry , another relative , recalled Miss Teller as an " independent , restless soul " who disliked remaining too long in any one spot . For that reason she shifted from one school district to another . She refused to live with her Westchester relatives or with a sister who has a home in Toledo . She preferred to mingle with the poor folk of the east side . The policemen on Third Avenue knew her . Sometimes she would drop in at the East Thirtyfifth Street police station for a friendly chat and she never tired of telling the neighbors of the days when she was a " schoolmarm " around New York . " She was mighty spry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " She went to bed every night at 9 o'clock and was up and around at noon the next day . Before she came here she had a furnished room over at 145 East Twenty-ninth Street . " When they learned that the little old woman who went about in a faded black dress and a faded old black straw bonnet was the descendant of a President they were awed . The Tellers , according to Mrs. Barrett , came to New Amsterdam with the original Dutch settlers . William Teller , a grandfather of the school teacher , was killed by Hessian troops while carrying a message for General Washington from Peekskill to Newburgh during the Revolution . He was chased out on the ice to a place where the crust was thin and he and his horse were drowned . Pierre Teller , the school teacher 's uncle , was in the crew of the frigate Constitution . One day while home on leave he persuaded Miss Teller 's father  --  his brother  --  to come down to inspect the old ship , then kept him aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable sum in her fifty years of teaching and kept her money in the Dobbs Ferry Bank . Every Spring , at apple blossom time , she would come to Dobbs Ferry to have the interest entered in her book ; that was the reason she advanced for the visits to her Westchester relatives . The truth of the matter , however , according to Mrs. Barrett , was that Miss Teller , in her girlhood , had rejected a proposal of marriage made when the apple trees were in bloom in Westchester . The man she rejected married another . Miss Teller realized her mistake and the pain of it lived in her memory through the long years . In the hall bedroom , with the old licenses , were a bankbook showing a deposit of several hundred dollars in the Dobbs Ferry Bank , three gold rings and one of silver and a single cuff link , apparently a man 's . It is old gold , worn down to paper thinness , as if from constant handling . Relatives will bring the body to Peekskill for burial in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
