THE SCARECROW A STORY BY ELIZABETH MADOX ROBERTS J OAN went down the path to the hen yard , her mother 's voice still telling her to feed the brooding hen . Away from the voices of the house , she entered into the mid-morning quiet of the farm . She stopped at the hen 's nest and she ran her hand among the soft feathers of the brooding mother , her sense of the place spiced with the odors of sweet lime and the odors of feathers that lay decaying in the dry dust underfoot . Her hand under the breast of the quiet fowl and warm in the soft down that hovered the eggs , she stopped , listening for some fact which might be more true than the fact of her hand . The shed was dim even in the brightest hours of the day . The hen had been sleeping over the eggs for two weeks . In another week she would be wasted of her strength , her feathers dull and ragged , her body thin . Then the eggs would begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give birth to more life . Joan lifted the hen from the nest and put her on the ground , setting her gently down . Then she gave her food from her hand and set a can of water before her . The hen clucked with anger and anxiety but she accepted Joan 's care . Chattie , her mother , had said that if a dozen of the eggs hatched she would count the outcome very successful . Joan saw again her mother 's strong , thin hand going into a basket to choose the eggs , taking one , rejecting another . The care of the hand that went cautiously into the basket , feeling for surfaces , lifting eggs , turning one gently aside to pry out another of a more choice shape or weight , these lay now with the eggs in the nest , and Joan touched them with her thought . When the hen had settled back to the nest Joan shut her safely in , and turned to go from the shed . Infinities of planning lay before her as she walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound as feet had made it , swerving to the right or to the left . Infinities of rises , hillocks , low difficulties which the feet met , all feet , daily , and she was at the back door , her hand on the knob of the latch , her ear ready for the cry of the door when it should come at the end of the beating of her footsteps . She touched all these things without a care and sensed them intimately , feeling them with the senses and with memory . Joan would not let any hand touch her . Since she could first remember she would scarcely endure to let any other flesh touch her own . Her mother had given up trying to wash her or comb her hair when she was four years old . In the kitchen she drew back her hand from the salt jar because her mother 's hand went there . Seeing Joan draw away from the salt , Tiny , her sister , said : " Some day I aim to catch Joan by the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday I touched her accidentally , and she flinched , " Betsy , the other sister , said . " The way she flinched you 'd think she was a horse . " " Since she was born she was always like that , I remember . Less than a year old and she 'd push your hand off . " " I do n't see how anybody so touchy ever got horned , firstplace . To get horned is a right touchy matter , " Chattie said . " What makes her flinch ? " " She 's just like her pap , " Chattie said as she went past Tiny and Betsy on her way to the pantry . " Wo n't Pap let anybody touch him ? How do you mean ? Wo n't Pap ? " Tiny asked . " Not all the time , " Chattie said , half whispering . " Joan , though , she 's more techous than Pap . Two hundred years ago and they 'd say it was witches had ahold of her . " " One time I asked old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody touched her and she said . . " " What did she say ? " Betsy asked . " She said . . . I hate to name what she said . " " Be quiet , " Chattie called out . " Do n't you , Tiny , name such . Do n't name witches and such hags when it 's your own sister you 're of a mind to speak of . Get me two cups and bring me two good eggs . Quit all this gabble and get the work done . " The sounds of the house were continually blended now . Tiny putting the wood into the stove and Betsy taking butter from the churn . The scraping clatter of the vessels and the clink of iron on iron as the fire was mended , and Betsy was speaking : " When I get a home of my own I 'll have a newer style churn . I ca n't abide this old rick much longer . " " Marry to get a new churn ? " Tiny asked . " I 'd as lief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get e'er one . " The reply was made without malice , a good-natured retort . Tiny 's lover was thought to be stingy . Joan turned Betsy 's reply about in mind and adjusted it to what Betsy continually said of Nelse Smith  --  that he was not a free spender . Marry and get a churn . Marry and get no churn at all . She was amused at the retort , laughing softly within , hearing Betsy 's voice . Being the youngest , Joan waited to be told what to do . It was her continual office to wait upon the others . She stood beside the door , waiting . " If you get a good home and plenty to do with , " Chattie said , " why then , it makes no great matter of difference about what he gives you in the way of money . " All that Chattie said seemed true . All was accepted without belief or disbelief . Words rolled swiftly through the air , as they had rolled many times before , as true as the air itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two good cows , and a woman can make for herself , and ought to . A man has got his hands full to pay off the notes and buy the tools to do with . " Chattie was right , Joan reflected , was always right . Joan had been called to make the bread , and her hands were now in the bread tray . Chattie 's words told her one thing while her hands were retelling it . There was flour in plenty in the bin , for her father had rolled a barrel of it into the kitchen in the early spring . The hour was given entirely to the bread . Her hands in the tray , Joan knew the whiteness of ground wheat . She stirred the mellow sponge into the flour and felt the resistance of the froth as it took the wheat into its moisture and became dough , her hands soft in the mass , her hands partaking of the softness and making whorls as the flour subdued the paste . Chattie and rightness ran together through the air , admonitions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were a household , a house full of demanding life , and all outside existed for them . They were a house demanding bread for itself . It is thus , Chattie said , being right . Joan stirred the dough and kneaded it , making it ready for the oven . A great voice , rough and broken , came , breaking and scraping the air apart . A great rough voice broke through the outside air and beat roughly on the house , a voice that belonged nowhere inside . It broke her contemplation of the bread and it broke the chatter of the kitchen . It was her father out toward the barns crying : " Where 's Joan ? Joan ! Joan ! The crows ! the crows ! The crows are pullen the new corn ! Come quick , Joan . The crows ! the crows ! The crows are at the new corn ! " Running up to the new field , she was haunted by rhythmic words , phrases that matched her father 's voice and her own feet going quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sound would come , " Joan , Joan , Joan , Joan , the crows are at the corn . " The words seemed never sufficient to state the speed of her limbs . They were not near enough to the down-throb and the up-bending of her feet . She had grown tall at some time when no one was noticing how she grew , not even herself . She leaped forward now , dressed in an old short skirt Betsy had outgrown . She herself had outgrown it too , had stretched out , more tall than Betsy , but nobody had noticed this or cared . She was still the youngest , hardly of any weight . Blown in the wind , the short garment no more than a flutter of drapery about her loins , she walked or leaped out to the hill field tothe right of the house to frighten away the crows . Sometimes she would sing a part of what her feet were beating : " Tinker , tinker , tell me true , Have you seen all there is to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went lightly along the edge of the cornfield , walking in the year-old grass that was refreshed now with new growth . Tiny had said of her : " I believe Joan draws all the crows here . No other farmer , you 'll notice , has got such a pest of crows . She scares crows away with one hand and waves howdy-do to the whole flock with th ' other . " " How draws crows ? What you say is nonsense , " Chattie speaking . It was late summer . The air was hot and full of fulfilled life , and the sky changed day by day from blue to haze-lit violet . The crows often came to the field of ripening corn , working now in small groups , not in the great flocks of the early spring . They plucked at the sheaf that covered the roasting ear and tore their way into the tender corn . Her father would not send Tiny out to the field , she reflected , and he would not call Betsy to run to the pasture to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come , come , " that broke over the quiet chatter of the house and the fixed admonitions of their mother . Since she was a small child her father had made a helper of her for himself , as he had no boys . He seldom talked to her , or to any other , but he knew that , following his great outcry , " Joan , Joan , the corn ! " the field would be tended . It was late summer when she observed that she and Tiny and Betsy were three women now . Chattie was good to them . She wanted to get them out of the house so that the place would be her own , as it had been when she was first married . She sewed all day for THE SCARECROW them , making wedding clothes for Tiny , making things for Betsy whose marriage would come soon after Tiny was gone . Joan was a tall girl now , a woman with long round legs and quick fingers . Sometimes she carried the long breadths of her sewing with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crows from the grain or from the young ears . Her father 's voice would boom among the barns . Out in the field beside the fencerow she would wave her dress in unsewed fragments and shout and hiss in rhythmic jargon until the birds flew away to chatter and talk on some distant glade-side . The young men were here and there . Jacob said to her , " I saw you back in the field just now , after the crows . How comes it you 're here ? " Tony Wright came close to her , as if he were about to kiss her . His eyes were soft and full of fondness . He leaned near and held his hand toward her , teasing and familiar : " I saw you up on the hill with the buzzards . " " And now I 'm down here with the buzzards . " " Which buzzards do you like best ? " " As lief one kind as the other . It 's all one which kind I 'm with . " Then Jacob , running off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the acute point of herself , " I see a turkey buzzard one day , close up , and how it did smell . " " Close up , they do smell a bad odor out of themselves , " Joan said . " Iffen I 'm a buzzard , " Tony said , " I 'd as well go on home to roost . " His eyes were on her as if he would ask her to bid him stay . They came and went , the year moving slowly toward the new spring . PI Tony Wright had a creeping , three-cornered crow 's foot that twinkled at the side of his mouth and made a smile there . Hedger Hill could lift a hundred pounds and never spread his legs apart to do it . There were strong ripples in the muscles of his thighs , and his hands seemed to know the use of every tool and to set themselves upon each with practiced carelessness . He would lift up his head , rolling upward his strong neck , and smile at her . Riley had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his band for Tiny , and she would slap at his fingers . He walked straight forward , kicking the grass with his toes , being certain of where he meant to go , and Tiny had discarded the close-handed lover for him . Tony would make a light boast of himself as having more mishaps than any other , as carrying more bad luck . " What did I do but blow out a tire . Trust me to spill the whole parcel of oats before I got the mule inside the field . " He made a boast of these mishaps as if he were of sufficient force himself to carry any amount of bad luck . He had a pretty twinkle in the skin under his eyes , and his hair curled lightly upward . They were all about in the spring , and Betsy was marrying . They were on the roads , in the house , in the yard , on Sunday afternoons and weekdays . They were under the trees playing on Sundays , or walking away , two and two . Joan knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hedger Hill was something more than Tony Wright , but Tony 's creeping , three-cornered , crow-foot smile was something more again . Riley would fling his arm about Tiny and cry out something pert to her , Joan , as she poured water out of the pitcher into the glasses . Joan liked all of them and wanted them to be near her . She liked for them to be coming along the road , to be shouting for her from the gate , to shout at her as she ran away to tend the corn . " It 's only Joan , " Betsy said . " Nobody but Joan . " Tiny was not jealous when Riley followed her to the hill , and Betsy let The field was large that year . The Hedger call her from the gate , shout crows heeded the apparition , and they ing , " Joan , Joan , it 's Joan is wanted " kept away from it , but the other end of when he was drunk a little . When he the field was not guarded unless she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often to tend it . She whom he had married . Tiny had thought she might make another married now . As formerly , Joan would image of herself , to free herself ennever let anybody touch her skin or fin tirely from the task of watching . ger her hair , man or woman or child . Thinking that she would make this image , she sat at the side of the field , It was morning , spring being well the spring being late and warm . advanced . The house seemed pleas The image was never executed with ant as she left it , as she was drawn out her hands but it came into being in her side by her father 's voice , " Joan , mind . A great flock of crows was enJoan , where 's Joan ? come , come ! circling the lower field , ready to alight , The crows ! The crows are on the new or it took fright at the image in the corn !

The house up and down . He shouted her a seemed delightful in memory as she sudden good-by and went away , but he ran , for Chattie was moving indoors came back shortly after . There were among the upturned beds , was making three crooks bending at the skin at the precedents by which her girls must side of his mouth , as if three smiles be guided . A maternal warmth ran contended there . Her thought settled through the rooms with the flow of downward to the earth , the ground , the spring air and the odors of feathers as rolling world , and thus she saw , as the beds spread their great checks to apart but near , the image , herself , the sun of the open doorways . Chattie flinging up its arm to the sky to frighten had brought quilts down from her the crows . boxes above stairs to divide among her The image was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame over which was drawn a quiverlowed her as she ran over the new clods ing curtain of skin and blood .

The image screamed lightly Then Joan made a scarecrow of when it was touched , but the touch some of her clothes . She set up first a made its horror drunk so that the post for a body and made a stiff arm horror flattened to a plane and then that bent upward toward the sky to drew inward to a line or a thread that threaten . She fastened a staff in the lay as an unwilling serpent crushed hand . The apparition walked on the beneath a weight of willing blood . brow of the cornfield , its skirt fluttering Herself and the image fell asleep in the in the wind , its hat bent over its white glade , Tony Wright fending her away face . She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw the a likeness to herself as she could , blue sky overhead and the small fleeces using her own habitual clothing , and that floated through it .

Tony said , " I have got the world in my hands . " She was herself the world , the sheaf gone off from it . Tender and unprotected , . she was wrapped in hands . He smoked his tobacco and blew the smoke over her . He rubbed gently downward on her face and her throat and stroked her body . He laughed with her and took her shoes from her feet and he bent her this way and that , glad of his power over her . She waked when a flock of geese went noisily along the creek , going home for the night . She brushed whatever bound her aside and sat upright , and she took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glade and when Tony came near to her again she flung him aside , her strength gathering . Anger and renewed horror made her strong and she warded herself from his fingers . She ran down the hill and out to the corn rows , leaping over the new green shoots and the plucked grain that the crows had despoiled , and she scattered the clods to a small dust that trembled in the air after her foot was gone . She walked through the house the next day on the duties assigned to her , as if she were no part of the place , as if she were an unrelated gadget pitched awkwardly through the utensils and through the prescribed hours . Her father spoke at the table : " I spent the day in the corn . I replanted fifty hills the crows uprooted ? a flock , a thousand strong , you 'd think . " " I thought Joan made a scarecrow . " They talked about the image in the upper field . " No crow went anear the upper field , " they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the morning and asked for her , but she would not go out . The next day he found her as she sat by the window to mend a rent in her smock . " I believe Joan draws the crows , " Betsy said , there to visit for the day . " No other farmer has such a blight of crows in his field . Scares off the crows with one hand and waves a hello to the whole flock with th ' other . " Tony stood outside the window and talked to her , delicately embarrassed , in a blush under his sunburnt skin . When he came inside the door she slipped away to the back room of the house and climbed to the roof . She sat against the chimney until dark fell , seeing the tall image of herself in the field of corn and planning how she would make another as true as the first . There was talk below stairs . The voices came to her as loud , flattened speech , such as the crows used , a dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admonition . Tony Wright was below , speaking , and Chattie was angry . Tiny and Betsy were speaking . Once her father 's voice same as a great rough blow thrust across the flattened chatter of the crows . " Very well , " Chattie said . Very well was the burden of all that was said . The voices came through the opened windows and broke against the chimney , and they came again through the chimney opening from below . They came swiftly and slowly , so that there were often two reports of a word , the slow and the fast , not falling together . The plan was made below . " She 's shy , " Tony said . They set the day for her wedding . When they began to name a day for her she went below from the roof and walked slowly among them . They were sure and final in all that they said . Her father was not at hand . Betsy and Tiny looked at her , questioning her with their looks , as if they expected maternity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the blue quilt , lovers ' knots , " Chattie said . " And she can have the twenty yards of pure linen in the big bolt . Because she 's the last , she can have the lovers 's knots and the linen for sheets . " They looked at her , but they did not answer her . " And Tuesday it will be , " Chattie said , " right after dinner time , in the middle of the day . I 've already told Tiny to spread word of it over on the ridge and farther . " Tony walked about among them proudly , as if he had done a righteous thing . Humble and proud , with rightness coloring him over , he walked up and down . " I 'm ready to marry her , " he said . " It will be Tuesday , soon after twelve o'clock , " Chattie answered . Tony looked at her with fear and pleasure as he turned his car toward the east road . He was going home to live with his father , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls over there , " he said . " And my father , he 'll wake you up , against he makes his jokes . Nobody in the house but you and me and my old daddy . " They slipped lightly down through green pastures and brown fields where new corn wavered in a pattern that spread in fan shapes as they passed . " You 'll like the girls at McGill 's , " he said . " They 'll be your closest neighbors . There 'll be a plenty to do , but I wo n't work you too hard " ? a joke he was making about the housewife 's office , and he gave her a pretty look as he spoke . She did not speak on the drive , and when the car went into a farm gate and stopped before a house , she alighted and looked slowly about her . She studied the house quickly as she stood before it . There were three rooms below stairs and two above . She saw into a remote future and herself settled into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being her own . An old man came forward to greet her , speaking with restrained politeness . He took her hand stiffly and said howdo-y-do to her . She saw Tony carry her baggage up the stairs that went upward in the hall . She walked about the yard and looked at the hens , Tony showing her about . She was sorry for the old man as he went stiffly about the yard . He came from the barn presently with a pail filled with milk , and he said that he would always milk for her , making some joke that he imagined . A negress had prepared supper in the kitchen , but when the table was set and the food brought in , the cook went away . Joan answered the old man stiffly . After she had eaten a bit of the food the old man arose from the table , saying that he would go to his daughter 's house three miles away . He did not like to stay near the newly married , he said . " Ill leave this place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like to stay around the newly-wed . They were silly , and a selfish lot . He would go for a few days . " So much loven makes me sick inside my stomach , " he said . " The turtledoves can have this place for a spell . " He went away on a horse in the dusk , and the new moon came out clear in the western sky . The late birds were singing . Joan carried the dishes to the kitchen and began to wash them , her arms wooden and her mind choked with pity . Tony went back and forth outside but he stopped at the kitchen door to say that she should not work , that she should let the dishes stand . He would send for Rose , the colored woman , in the morning . Joan went steadily through the housewife 's task . She washed each piece and dried it carefully . She stopped once and stared at three sharp knives that lay together on the table . Her eyes were fixed on the knives , measuring them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharpest point , a paring knife four inches long in the blade , and she concealed it in the bosom of her dress . The new moon became large and red , a long arc of light near the place where the sun had set . Old John Wright 's words wheedled and droned before her ears , " the house . .. the turtledoves . " Tony stayed outside , and the moon set . She heard nothing but the mules thumping the boards of their stable and the night insects ticking in the grass , the clock slowly ticking in a rocking pulse . One lamp burned in the house , that in the dining room . She sat beside it , waiting . The stillness was opened and infinite sounds were discovered inside . There was no step without , although she strained her ear in the silence to hear one . A great tree grew near the house . In the stillness there came an irregular faint tapping , a light tap and a lighter , down-falling , slow-moving thud of muted tone , as soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leaf at a time , slowly and fitfully , letting go a leaf and then a leaf . She turned toward the window and listened , but there was no sound outside and no leaves lay on the window sill or in the shaft of light that extended from the window . The old clock on the mantel shelf marked the hours without chime or bell , and presently the hands folded together to point to midnight . Then Joan remembered herself washing the crockery , the shadows of twilight creeping outside . She remembered the lifting of her hands and the light flow of the water , the low chime of the milking tin when it was lightly shaken together . The shuffle and whisper of feet outside in the grass and on the stones came again to her , and the old man 's passing voice , " Turtle-doves . . . I 'll go to my daughter 's . " A remembered shuffle and whisper of feet outside , moving among the tools at the back of the house , a face passing near the window glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife into the bosom of her dress . She took the knife from her dress and laid it before her on the table . She covered the blade with a paper but left the handle clear to see , within the reach of her hand . The clock marked another hour , moving swiftly . The world , all the creatures in it , lay crying in her own breast . The clock , slowly ticking , made beings , each one a human being , jointed with sound , a man and a man , dripping one by one , falling sadly through the eternal dark , within herself . Three hours passed thus , swiftly . There was a faint tread somewhere outside , as if feet receded in the damp grass . Three steps , falling swiftly away , moved backward from the house . A faint gray light began to powder the air , and a bird chirped faintly iu the tree beside the house . A realization that this gray light would be the dawn of another day filled Joan with hate and horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where her hands had been , and she went out the front door , passing through the hall and near the stairway which she had never climbed . She went quickly , without stealth , out into the highway , and she set her way toward the west , along the way she had come . She walked toward the west , passing along the empty road in the first gray of the dawn . None passed her for an hour , and when she was tired she went a little way into a field to rest . She was walking back to her own place , to her own way of life  --  not to her people , for they bad driven her out  --  but to her own scenes . The field of corn , the pasture where the young lambs fed , the nests where the hens brooded , the run of the hills , the accidental meeting , the young men calling for her , the strange , unpredicted , unprepared , wind-blown and furrow-tumbled , lost-and-found afternoon , herself , one and the same , laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She went forward when she had rested for a little time . The day passed into noon . A woman took her into a car and she rode five miles , and later a man gave her a short ride . As she neared her own region she left the highroad and went across the fields . The last miles were hard to go , for the shoes were worn from her feet and her limbs were tired . At dark she walked into her father 's house and her mother cried out at the sight of her . " What is this ? " her mother asked . She pulled her sleeve and jerked her into the light . " What is this ? " She brought a basin of warm water in which Joan bathed her torn feet and she asked questions , scolding . Then she hurried Joan up the stairs , to have her away from the questioning eyes of any neighbor who might come , lured by the lights that burned late in the house . " It 'll he all over the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a state . A body would think Tony , he whipped you . " There was a great noise in the upper room where Joan habitually slept . Betsy and Tiny had come . Joan was glad to be there . Beyond the uproar of Chattie 's voice she sank into a pleased drowse of weariness and gratitude . For her the incident was well over . She had not thrust with the knife ; no great anger had hurled her hand through the air clenched tightly around the handle . The matter was well over . She was tired . She wanted to sleep . Chattie was speaking : " That 's your home now . Not this . " She bustled about the house , getting linen for Joan 's bed , getting clothing for Joan 's soiled and broken body . " It 's no light matter , " she said . She was angry , scarcely able to talk , and her gestures were rough and strong . " Turn down the light , " one said . " Up , you mean , " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the country here to ask is something the matter . Joan goes back . Bring the salve for her feet and let her rub it on . She 's got no marks of violence on her , as I can see . On her skin , Tiny ? Look and see . " " She 's Mrs. Tony Wright , no matter . " " Yes , she 's Mrs. Wright . " Pride and hard feeling drew her mouth about into set shapes . She had married marriage , and they were satisfied . She lay on the bed and heard their plans for her . " She goes back , " Chattie said . She began to scream in dry , sobbing tones , voiceless , in great panting whispers . Her father 's voice thundering at the foot of the stairs : " Joan , Joan ! She wo n't marry where she 's not of a mind to . She 's not hound to . " He was coming up the steps slowly . His strong tread shuffled along the flight , his shoes too large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairstep . He pushed the door of the room open and stood , his hand on the latch . " Joan , she 's not bound to marry where she 's not of a mind to . She 's not bound to marry . Let Tony Wright stay away from here . You all harken to what I say . Joan , she 's not married . You leave Joan be . "
