Too Busy to Work ( Fox ) . People who like Will Rogers in the cinema often use the word " lovable " to describe his gargling impersonations . This time Will Rogers is a lovable tramp named Jubilo , vaguely desirous of revenging himself on a man who made off with his wife during the War . Even revenge , for Jubilo , reduces itself to loitering . He loiters into the household of a respectable judge ( Frederick Burton ) who naturally turns out to be the man Jubilo is looking for . After trying to milk a cow by putting a pail under it and saying " Go on ! " , straightening out romantic difficulties for his own daughter ( Marion Nixon ) without telling her who he is , Jubilo loiters away from the household of Judge Hardy , singing a Jubilo song . <P> If I Had a Million ( Paramount ) develops an obvious idea in an obvious way .

John Glidden ( Richard Bennett ) is a crusty millionaire , infuriated by the avarice and incompetence of the persons who expect to inherit his money . Instead of making a will he decides to distribute his fortune , $1,000,000 at a time , to persons selected at random from the telephone directory . The first million goes to a butter-fingered salesman ( Charles Ruggles ) in a china store . He buys himself a cane , invites his employer to watch him use it on shelves of tableware . A prostitute ( Wynne Gibson ) takes a room in an expensive hotel and goes to bed alone , without her stockings . A forger ( George Raft ) is unable to find anyone who will cash a good check for him . He ends by trading it for one night 's shelter , to the proprietor of a 10 lodging house who uses it to light a cigar . A bedazzled Marine ( Gary Cooper ) , an ex-vaudeville actress ( Alison Skipworth ) and her husband ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond ) are also among Mr. Glidden 's beneficiaries , as is a miserable fat clerk ( Charles Laughton ) . This clerk waddles to the office of the president of his concern , pauses to straighten his necktie , then opens the door . What he does next is impossible properly to describe . The last recipient of Mr. Glidden 's largesse is Mrs. Walker , the most energetic inmate of an old lady 's home . She uses her money to turn the home into a sort of resort hotel , where games of chance , cursing , radios and cookery , previously forbidden , are encouraged . <P> Directors Ernst Lubitsch , Norman Taurog , Stephen Roberts , Norman McLeod , James Cruze , William A. Seiter and H. Bruce Humberstone were responsible for various episodes of If I Had a Million and 16 Paramount writers took part in what must have been the highly amusing game of writing it .
