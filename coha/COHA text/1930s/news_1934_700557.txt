txt General Motors Corp . joined the movement for higher automobile prices Wednesday with announcement of increases on all its lines . At the same time . Henry Ford , in a copyrighted interview with Dow , Jones &; Co. , declared categorically that prices would not be raised on the Ford car , stating that neither higher wage costs nor higher material costs could force increases on his product . The General Motors increases amounted to $25 on the standard Chevrolet , 530 on the master Chevrolet. $20 on the Pontiac , $35 on the Oldsmobile Six . $65 on the Oldsmobile Eight , $65 to $130 on the Buick , $100 on the Lai Salle and $300 on the Cadillac . With General Motors now allied with Chrysler in a higher price schedule to offset increased labor and material costs , the Ford announcement indicated determination on Ford 's part to use low prices as a prime weapon in his attempt to regain ground lost to the other two manufacturers in the lowest price passenger car geld during recent years . The three companies together account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . Ford Price Differential Widened As the result of the advances on the competing Chevrolet and Plymouth lines , the two heaviest selling models in the standard Ford V-8 line are now priced f.o.b. from $80 to $90 below the comparable models in the Chevrolet master line and from $105 to $110 below the comparable models in the Plymouth 114-inch wheelbase line . At the start of the year , the Ford differential was from $50 to $60 against the Chevrolet and from $60 to $65 against the Plymouth . In 1933 , the Ford differential on these models was from 55 to $15 against the Chevrolet and from $15 to $25 against the Plymouth . In the de luxe Ford line , in which a majority of the company 's sales are now being made , these two comparable models are now from 540 to $50 below the Chevrolet master , against $10 to $20 at the start of the year , and from $65 to $70 below the 114-inch Plymouth , against $20 to $25 at the start of the year . In 1933 , these Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cheirolet and from $25 to $35 above the Plymouth . Delivery Charges a Factor In the case of Chevrolet , these differentials are somewhat reduced by the reduction in de- livery charges carried out by Chevrolet at the start of the year which offset about half of the original Chevrolet price increase over the 1933 line . However , Ford recently compensated for part of this discrepancy by reducing the delivery charges on his line by from $10 to $25 . On the new list price schedule , prices on the two heaviest selling Ford standard models are met most closely by the Chevrolet standard six , built on a 108-inch wheelbase , against 112 inches for Ford . which includes a coach priced $15 below the Ford Tudor . and by the 108-inch wheelbase Plymouth , including a two-door sedan priced $10 above the Ford Tudor and tifourdoor sedan priced $25 above the Ford Fordor . In 1933 , the Chevrolet standard coach was priced $45 below the andard Ford V-8 Tudor and the Plymouth models were from $35 to $50 under the Ford models . The new price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two principal competitors which has been evident since the start of the 1934 season . The 1934 Chevrolet and Plymouth models , incorporating extensive changes over the 1933 lines which involved substantial expenditures for tools and dies , were introduced at price advances ranging up to 15% over last year 's cars . Increased labor and material costs were also responsible for the higher prices . Ford , on the other hand , conforming to his usual policy of avoiding annual model changes , restricted the changes on his line to less extensive improvements and hence escaped heavy tool charges . The increases in list price on the Ford line for 1934 were held to an average of about 5% . Wage and Steel Advances Increased Costa The institution of a 10% wage rate increase by General Motors and Chrysler during the recent labor crisis in the industry was accompanied by a warning that such action eventually would- require higher prices . The advances in steel prices recently announced , promising further advances in material costs for the car makera in the future , were another factor responsible for the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been contended since the start of the year that the higher prices established originally on 1934 cars did not compensate for all the advance in costs over 1933 . Ford 's labor costs also have increased substantially through the reinstatement of the $5 minimum daily wage for his employes in March . His threat to fight higher prices on his materials by manufacturing his own supplies was forecast by his recently announced plans to expand the capacity of the Ford steel mills in Detroit . Ford 's share of the domestic automobile market fell to 20.8% in 1933 from 40% in 1930 . This year . for the first time since 1931 , Ford was in active production at the start of the year . In 1933 and 1932 , he was not able to supply the retail market until well into the spring . Furthermore , by escaping the delays encountered by his competitors through the tool and die strikes during the fall , Ford was in a position to MI retail orders from the start of the yenr , in contrast to a shortage of competing makes lasting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total domestic passenger car market secured by Chevrolet . Ford and Plymouth , the three dominant lowest priced makes , from 1930 through 1933 : The price advances effected by General Motors and Chrysler have more than compensated for the increase in costs resulting from the recent 10% increase in wage rates and thus should offset part of the uncompensated advance in costa on 1934 cars as well as providing a margin of safety against the pending additional advance in raw material prices . On most of the comparable models the increases announced by Chrysler were somewhat larger than those established by General Motors .
