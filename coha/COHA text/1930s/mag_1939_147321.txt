One effect of Depression II was to produce a hatful of jobhunter radio programs . On the busy Don Lee Network in the Far West , Help Thy Neighbor in two and a half years has helped place 13,000 persons . Chicago 's I Need a Job , over WGN and later WCFL , has placed some 2,400 in less than a year . Last week Detroit 's I Want a Job , conducted by the Michigan State Employment Service over WWJ , turned its first birthday . It had placed a modest 225 of 346 applicants who appeared on the program . More interesting than its 225 successes were some of the men for whom it found no jobs : <P> Richard Kettlewell , one of the first men Henry Ford hired when he was preparing to enter commercial automobile production in 1902 , later formed a tool , die and pattern business which earned him as much as $500,000 a year before it crashed during Depression I.

The Kaiser 's taste then was for Kuchen with only the very largest Streussel possible on top of it . Rohrbeck came to the U. S. in 1908 , became a citizen in 1913 , lost his job this year after some 30 years as a pastry chef in Manhattan , Philadelphia , Chicago , Detroit . When even his yum-yum recipe for Streusselkuchen* failed to find him a post over the radio , Hans Rohrbeck went out and got himself a good job , is now serving up his Kuchen at Lake St. Clair 's select Grosse Pointe Yacht Club . <P> <P> *The Streussel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , one grated lemon rind , one pinch of cinnamon , four cups of cake flour .
