Last week a train drew into Youngstown . Ohio , bearing upon it two Lords of Bethlehem , come to cry to the citizens of Youngstown , to the shareholders of Youngstown Sheet &; Tube . " Let there be merger ! " One of the pair was President Eugene Gifford Grace who had conducted all negotiations with Youngstown 's Founder-Chairman James A. Campbell . The other was joke-loving , big-chested , big-hearted Chairman Charles M. Schwab , than whom only Henry Ford is a more famed industrialist . Although Youngstown 's Campbell publicly advocated the deal , Cyrus Stephen Eaton of Cleveland has furnished fierce opposition ( TIME . March 24 ) . And , perhaps afraid of Mr. Schwab 's oratory , perhaps to be dramatic , but surely unwilling to compromise . Mr. Eaton left town almost the same minute that Bethlehem 's Lords arrived . <P> With victory-confident Mr. Eaton gone , the burden of the defense lay heavily upon Bethlehem . With resounding voice . Mr. Schwab told assembled Youngstowners : " I 'm one of the old folks in the steel business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in doing big things in a " big way . and doing them right . If I had any doubt this merger would not be a good thing for both of us , I would n't take it as a gift . My policy is to take a plant and make it grow . " Then , in a torrent of emotion , Orator Schwab told of his long friendship with Mr. Campbell , ended up with a plea : ' ' Jim Campbell , right or wrong , follow him . " To Chairman Schwab , President Grace is the perfect complement . Cool , logical , incisive . Mr. Grace quoted figures to show Bethlehem spends money on its plants , increases its payrolls . ' ' The strength of Bethlehem . " ' he said , " lies in the strength of local institutions . We create local institutions . We do not centralize . We are going to cooperate for bigger and better manufacturing in Youngstown . " <P> Despite these two speeches and a tearful one by Chairman Campbell , long and loudly applauded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John ( " Bonesetter " ) Reese , who by special dispensation of the Ohio Legislature does service to unjointed athletes ( . TIME , July 12 , 1926 ) . let it be known that he had switched his 1,000 shares to vote against the sale , then entrained for Florida . <P> Returning from Cleveland , Mr. Eaton again spoke against the " calamity ' ' and announced he had 412,571 shares whereas 395,201 could block the deal . To this Mr. Grace answered : " That statement is not at all in keeping with authoritative information I have received . ... " Just as dubious of Mr. Eaton 's victory was Chairman Campbell , saying : " It is absolutely foolish for anyone to make claims . . The proxies already in our hands leave no doubt in my mind that the merger will be approved . " <P> Thus , each side having finished its case , each side claiming victory , the City of Youngstown awaits April 8 when the stockholders ' meeting takes place . But no peaceful quiet marks the interim , for until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have given , align with the other side .
