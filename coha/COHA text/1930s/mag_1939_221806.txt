Ever since Oct. 24 , 1929 , crinkle-headed , crinkle-mouthed Crooner Rudy Valle has spread his oleaginous voice on the air waves for Standard Brands Inc . ( Fleischmann 's Yeast , Royal Gelatin ) . Their partnership is radio 's longest . Radio 's first big variety show made Yale-bred Rudy Valle ( real name : Hubert Pryor Valle ) radio 's first big-money performer , began radio 's first national song craze ( I 'm Just a Vagabond Lover ) , first exploited the radio talents of Edgar Bergen &; Charlie McCarthy , Alice Faye , Joe Penner , Frances Langford . Its popularity is still impressive , but not so impressive as that of later rival food merchandisers like Jack Benny ( JellO ) or Bing Crosby ( Kraft Music Hall ) . Last week Standard Brands and Valle announced an amicable parting of the ways next September 28 , within crooning distance of their tenth anniversary . Of his plans , Rudy Valle characteristically observed : " ' My Time Has Been Your Time ' for ten solid years , and it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for a little while . "
