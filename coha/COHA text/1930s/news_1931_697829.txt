txt The next scene in Henry Ford 's international drama of attempting to raise world wages takes place at the International Labor Office , Geneva , next Wednesday , behind closed doors . For the first time in history , comparable " real wage " statistics from a dozen different nations and 17 different cities will be brought together on a long table by international economists . The preliminary work of gathering the basic American statistics showing how Ford 's lowest-paid workers live in Detroit has been completed and published . Ethelbert Stewart , head of the bureau of labor statistics . who gathered the figures , has already left for Geneva . The next stage will be the comparison of equivalent figures from the 17 European cities where Mr. Fold has or intends to set up factories . The figures are designed to tell Mr. Ford what daily minimum rate of pay in the currency of each country is necessary in order to give the workers in these towns a " real wage " equivalent to that of the Ford worker in Detroit .

The cost of the American survey of 100 Detroit Ford lowest-paid workers was defrayed chiefly by the United States bureau of labor statistics , which was eager to have this comparison  --  the first authoritative one of its kind in history  --  completed . May Keep Figures Secret Whether the figures assembled at Geneva will be given to the press is uncertain . In the interval between the start of the work a year ago , and the present , opposition to the plan has been repeatedly expressed by certain European employers . Opposition is based against establishment of " Ford wages " in competition with local wages . The attack on high wages was brought from Europe to the International Chamber of Commerce meeting just concluded here , when European manufacturers declared that the same system of high wages found in the United States wbuld not be adapted to European countries , unless accompanied by tariffs and other American domestic conditions . Whether the opposition will have the effect of blocking publication of the figures is unknown . It is understood that an effort will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon by the council of the International Labor Office , connected with the League of Nations . Mr. Ford 's high-wage policy combined with high production made pos sible by scientific mass methods has reduced costs and enabled him to capture a large share of the automobile market . The expanding world interest of the company has naturally raised the question of whether the same methods can be made successful abroad . In the summer of 1929 the Ford Motor Company Ltd . ( London ) asked the International Labor Office for information as to the minimum wage scale which should be paid in certain European cities where the company had , or contemplated , blanches , in order that their employees would have the same standard of living as the Detroit minimum paid worker  --  now S7 a day for a five-day week . House-to-House Visits Made Before this question was answered it was necessary to know what the lowest paid Ford worker could buy with his wage  --  to know his general standard of living . Since no infoinutdon existed on this point , a detailed study was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Ford company . A houseto-house visitation was instituted and a detailed list of all expenditures obtained from a group of 100 families .
