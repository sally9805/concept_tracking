txt The beauti ful Ohio let go its heaviest guns today on Cairo , a city under siege , but it made never a dent in the walls . The handful of citizens who remained on hand to watch the climax of the battle between the mighty river and puny man lost interest in the Ohio 's infinitesimal rise . There is a limit to worrying and fretting over the loss of material possessions , and that limit was reached here days ago when it became apparent that an army of relief workers shipped in by a paternalistic government could build bulwarks faster than old man river could rise . Today the . water was higher than it ever had been before , and even the scientists conceded that it could not go much higher . It was high enough tonight at 59:7 feet , 3.6 inches below the top of the walls and levees which stand between this city and the rushing torrent which has washed over ? scores of other cities and towns ? along the rich and fertile Ohio Valley . But winds , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slackening and the thrust of the waves was weakening . Wind , Current Play Tricks To say that the river is 3.6 inches below the top of the walls is mathematically accurate , according to the gauge readings of the army engineers . As a practical matter , however , it is not accurate . While the gauge reading is 59.7 and the walls are sixty feet high , the wind ; and the current have a trick of piling up water here and there so ? that in some places the river is washing over the wall and against the three-foot bulkhead that has been erected on its top . With a watertight bulkhead en , circling Cairo and its drainage district , an area of 168,000 acres , ? gangs of men from the WPA and the CCC were set to work this aft ternoon raising the levees on the Mississippi side and building a dike to protect the highway which forms Cairo 's last remaining link with the outside world . While these crews toiled , a hundred Noahs constructed arks for ? private and public use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the river 's surface , an old Negro and his wife built themselves a boat . Downtown , employes - of the Federal barge line hammered industriously at ' floats which they had been ordered to build to insure the escape of those who remained in town in the event that the levee broke . There seemed little prospect tonight that boats or floats would be needed , but , the Ohio being what it is , the natives kept on building anyway . ? The army of men who in the last seven days have raised the levee above the Ohio 's level withdrew today from the ramparts along the Ohio and Cache Rivers . Many went to work on the Mississippi levee , which is still three feet above the surface of that great stream , though the flooded Ohio hag backed it up , so that it , too , is rising . On the other side of town , where the first skirmish with the flooded Ohio was fought , the levees were patrolled by civilian volunteers , browsing pigs and stray dogs . Rabbits were plentiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the drainage district , most which was under water . While the levees held . with sign of weakening , Mayor Au ' Bode issued a warning to the fending army that with victory sight it was no time to relax . Mayor explained he was afraid t those of the weary populace remained at home to help defend their city from the rising water might sit back and congratulate themselves too soon . The Mayor was aroused because only a handful of Cairo citizens had responded to his call for able-bodied volunteers to patrol the levees which the relief workers from outside had built . The Mayor declared there were slackers among those who had remained behind as well as among those who fled with the women and children when they were ordered out . His call for volunteers ignored by many , he - issued an official draft order and said if that did not work he would try more drastic measures . " This Is the business of Cairo , " he said . " It is not to be left entirely to workmen sent here from out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Harry L. Hopkins , due here early tomorrow , will arrive of in a. town which has hardly enough zeitizens left to make up a decent 6ception committee . All its stores and businesses are closed . It is imssible even to obtain the services a barber or a laundress. es
