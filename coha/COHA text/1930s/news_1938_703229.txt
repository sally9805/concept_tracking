txt Major revision of the House tax bill by the Senate Finance Committee appeared certain following the latter 's first meeting on the measure Monday when 15 of the 21 committee members gave their support to the views expresed by Chairman Harrison over the week-end . This majority favors corporation taxes based on income instead of income distribution . The committee in executive session Monday heard an explanation of the House bill from Undersecretary of the Treasury Rohwell Magill and other Treasury and Congressional experts . The 11 Democrats and 4 Republicans on the committee who favor corporation income tax over an undistributed profits tax principle are as follows : Democrats  --  Chairman Harrison , and Senators King , George , Walsh , Bailey , Clark , Byrd , Lonergan , Gerry , Brown and Herring . Republicans ? Vandenberg , Townsend , Davis and Capper . Based on Improved Trade Forecast One of the highlights of the closed session discussions was a statement by Dr. Magill that the revenue expectation of the Treasury of $5 , - 330.000,000 is based upon a forecast of general pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . This view of favorable outlook for business later was expressed also by business leaders before the Senate unemployment committee at recent hearings . Dr. Magill , under questioning by committee members , stated that the bill as passed by the House fell short of revenue expectations by $22,000,000 . Congressional experts , however , estimated only a $6,000,000 loss , claiming that elimination of the closely held corporation tax and the increase of 25 cents a gallon in the liquor tax nearly offset each other . While the Treasury is reported to be still undecided on whether there will be a new budget summary in April as has been the case in past years . it was stated that if there is a revision of the budget estimates it will be based largely upon an analysis of the March 15 income tax returns . In the event of a downward revision in the revenue expectations based on March 15 returns , it was held pOssible that the Senate committee might be called upon to look for additional taxes . Requests Figure from Treasury In connection with a possible demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has requested the Treasury to supply the-committee with figures showing the amount of revenue being produced from the higher tax brackets so that the committee may determine whether the point of diminishing returns in the upper brackets has been reached and whether there should be a general broadening of the income tax base in order to raise the required amount of Treasury revenue . Considerable significance was attached to suggestions ' made by Chairman Harrison and Senator Bailey that a new definition should be made of " small corporations " which might be permitted to enjoy the benefits provided in the House bill for concerns in this classification . They contend that very large corporations may have net income of only $25,000 which is the present gauge and they suggest that the definition of a small corporation should be either on gross income or on capital investment . Chairman Harrison , according to some of his colleagues , is endeavoring to limit committee consideration of the tax bill to not more than 10 days . He himself states that he is going to rush the bill through as speedily as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue needs based on a corporation income tax . Dr. Magill declined to comment on the rate of corporation income tax that would be necessary to produce an amount of revenue equal to that which is estimated under the House bill . Senator George and others spoke of an 18% maximum tax .
