Last month 350 graduate students from 26 assorted Italian universities arrived in the U. S. for a grand sightseeing and goodwill tour of U. S. colleges . Before they sailed back to Italy last week , they had visited no less than 35 campuses and provided the country with an interesting litmus-paper test on the political and educational ideas of Benito Mussolini . <P> Prevailing official opinion on each campus was that the visitors should be received as guests , regardless of their political views . Most U. S. students who were interested enough to have any attitude at all accepted this gentlemanly one without question . In sizable cities there were usually four or five hotheads who bawled " Down with Fascism ! " in the visitors ' hearing , but no smalltown collegian so far forgot his manners . <P> At Princeton a lone townsman cried " Down with Mussolini ! " in the midst of a reception , was jostled by students , escorted off the campus . <P> At Harvard the pinko National Students League protested to President Conant , but allowed the visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical clubs addressed a long protest to President Angell . But there were only eleven antiFascists waiting outside University Dining Hall to chorus " A basso il Fascismo ! " These the Italians proceeded to pummel into silence . <P> Not until the visitors reached Manhattan last week did their political creed make really riotous headlines . At New York University a crowd of students gathered outside the Hall of Fame , yelled " To Hell with Fascism ! " The Italians marched out , cheerfully drowned the hecklers with a chant of " Il Duce ! Il Duce ! Il Duce ! II Duce ! " Policemen prevented more than a few mild fisticuffs . <P> At teeming College of the City of New York there were loud boos and hisses as the Italians marched into a convocation of 3,000 students . Snapped President Frederick Bertrand Robinson : " The conduct of some of you is worse than that of guttersnipes ! " <P> A student stood up on the platform , began : " I only wish to bring a message to the enslaved Italian students who are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microphone . While the guttersnipes joyfully rose to join battle with their gentlemanly fellows , the visiting Italians were quietly led out a back door . The brawl lasted 15 minutes . Afterward 1,000 students met in the college stadium for a rousing Fascist-cursing rally . Eleven ringleaders were suspended from college .
