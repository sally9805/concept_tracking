txt On the floor of the dining room in his basement flat Miles Kramer lay dead  --  a bullet in his heart . About the body of the 38 year old amateur inventor and day dreamer stood the police and Kramer 's tearful widow , Helen , 35 years old . Urged by the police , the widow told her story again , wearily . She had worked all day Saturday in an Irving Park boulevard department store where she is a clerk . In the early evening her husband telephoned her to say he had collected $100 in " back wages . " She was amazed , having believed him to be unemployed . Nevertheless the news was a happy surprise and when her day 's work ended at 8 p. m. she hurried home . She reached the basement apartment , 4243 North Keeler avenue , at about 8:45 p. m. and found her husband 's body , just as it lay when the police called . No Gun at Scene . " And you found no gun ? " The policeman had asked the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " No . There was no gun . " The policeman told Mrs. Kramer she was under arrest ; then he took her away , leaving members of his squad to search the house for a .38 caliber pistol . They found none . The widow was questioned further , the interrogation always coming back to the same point  --  the gun . At the inquest yesterday she told something of her late husoand 's character and habits . He was a moody fellow who spent most of his time mooning over mystery and detective stories , she said . Also he puttered around over inventions . He often told his wife fanciful tales of lucrative employment . His last phone call to her was an example of his imaginative stories , she added . The " $100 back pay " was not in his pockets . An interested listener at this recital was Capt . Joseph Goldberg of the Albany Park police . Could it have been , he asked himself , that this erratic character was carried away by the idea of dramatically staging his own murder ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieut . John and Patrolman James Fogarty and sent them back to the Kramer apartment . His order was : " Find that gun ! " One of the first things the investigators noticed when they reached the suite of rooms was a door in the dining room that led into a passageway about 10 feet long . ' Phis , they found , opened into the building 's boiler room . Besides 1 he boilers , there were built-in tubs for laundry work and a stove . There was nothing unusual about the room , however , and and Fogarty were about to turn away when something that was lying across a burner of the stove caught their attention . A Strange Find . It was an 8 inch length of 5/8 inch pipe . It was plugged at one end and the open end pointed toward the passage that led to the Kramer dining room . and Fogarty removed the plug and pulled out a discharged .38 caliber cartridge . It was the end of the mystery . Kramer , the police are convinced , swathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger diameter of the pipe . Then he jammed it in and attached the metal cap . He lighted a burner and fastened the pipe to the stove so the loaded erd of the pipe was over the flame . This done , Kramer stood in front of the bizarre weapoh and waited until the heat exploded the fulminate in the priming cap . Mortally wounded though he was , Kramer managed to reach his dining room before dying . The stove burner , police believe , was turned off later oy a janitor or a tenant who used the laundry
