txt Trouble in the Corridor . When the post-war census was taken in 1921 , 79.1 per cent of the population of the Corridor was Polish ; in 1931 , 89.9 per cent was Polish . I have recently read in some French publication that the population is now substantially over 90 per cent Polish , and that except for political agitators there would be no difficulty with the German minority . I am apprehensive that within a comparatively short time there may come an explosion on the GermanPolish frontier which might lead to trouble . The passions of the Germans , constantly fomented by Hitlerism , might result in the German masses getting out of hand and precipitating a clash . Then will come into play what Stresemann suggested to the Crown Prince in his famous letter to the effect that it would be difficult to determine who was the aggressor ; in other words , that it would be easy to create a situation which would enable Germany to assert that the Poles were the aggressors .
